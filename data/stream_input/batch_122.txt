B008FCE7C2|5|Fit perfectly just as if the dealer installed.
B00GIBF1BI|5|GOOD PRICE AND FAST DELIVERED
B00M3ENQXE|4|Local Lowes cut them for free.
B007KD0CX0|5|Perfect fit
B000BUTDCA|3|The male end block is really big. It is probably fine for most breaker boxes at campsites but I bought this to plug in at the paddock at Barber Motorsports Park and it wouldn't fit in the 50 amp covered plug box. Luckily another RVer had a smaller one and we traded.
B002BHWZFI|3|Tried it twice on a set of cheap swim goggles.  Simply didn't work.  A friend turned me onto it during an airsoft game, and it did work for that.
B00CVVUQ50|1|Size dont match
B004A30UHG|5|but this is a replacement for one that failed worked great wired right in perfectly easy to install anyone can do it
B005BNP7UO|4|Fine addition to my truck
B004G9VIXE|5|works great, good price
B00P5YPH18|5|Fit perfectly for the application that i needed them for.  I am using these on 2008-2010 chrysler  town & country 16&#34; 7 spoke alloy wheels.  These are remanufactured full face painted wheels that i am installing on my 2008 grand caravan.  For the people that complain that the caps that they ordered are the wrong size, guess what?  You didn't do your homework.  Dodge had at least 4 different size wheel caps for 2008.  You either google for what you're looking for with the year,make,model, wheel diameter & so on or call a dealer & get the correct part number for your needs.  Just to give a great product a poor rating for your failure to order the correct wheel caps is just plain BAD.  These are chinese reproductions of a dodge  54mm (2.125&#34;) wheel center cap.  New oem wheel caps from the dealer will set you back $80 or more.  Comparing the 2 side by side, i see no difference in looks or quality.  FYI the chrysler  t&c factory o.e.m. 16&#34; alloy wheels are manufactured in South Korea so i don't want to hear any complaints about cheap foreign junk.
B00E0173RI|5|It's a very GOOD vest I'm gonna order 8 more for my CLUB to wear during the winter awesome vest
B00ASMX23W|5|Very good price and a fast delivery
B001Q4QOSG|1|This one does not fit the 5 gallon buckets.  The buckets only go in about half way.  And the cover flies off and hits you in the face when you are driving the ATV any faster than 15 miles an hour.  Would not recommend.
B008E7PNZI|5|Parts fit great
B003O4SA2E|5|Fits the license plate perfectly!
B0002YUQ4E|5|This is the stuff use it with dremel buffing discs
B003ASHIJK|5|Glue works well and didn't dry out after cap was resealed. I have used it for 3 flats already.
B007VRCQRA|5|Fits good and seems to be a good durometer.
B00O5MVFZI|1|I honestly want to return it it is not firm it moves
B0002UNOYM|5|I have a black SUV.  It works great.  Makes it look like black water.
B0018C85VK|5|Just as described. quick shipping great seller. A+
B000CIMC5G|5|Awesome system. It is not to loud just the right pitch !
B000CSGWZM|5|It goes vroom...
B007ZSZJ42|5|Perfect but not cheap
B00BAKMTG2|5|Great product.  I tried everything to clean my disgusting balcony.  Used bleach, vinegar among other products.  This was the only thing that actually worked!
B000A8FMPU|5|Perfect fit
B00BZWRONI|3|Yes and no. I could perfectly placed pedals on and the brake and clucth. But the accelerator could not be installed, because the piece does not correspond to the model of the vehicle. The pedal car factory brings one piece that does not allow suits something extra above it. It's a shame.
B009YFEMP6|5|perfect for hard to reach spark plug wire boots like gmc trucks. thanks
B00GG9FB8U|5|great stuff, used the two bucket approach.  Cars look great!!
B00CWKMAZO|5|They look nice in the package. To be honest it is too hot right now to try and put them in the car.
B009OA37S4|5|Fits my 2013 hyundai elantra. Easy installation.
B00E1JOEI0|5|cheap
B005Y0OK1G|5|Easy to install,  looks better than original guard.
B00AMPJ7DE|5|Working good so far
B003AYY27U|4|The stuff you need for your gearbox and delivered to your door.  I like this
B000182ESC|5|Works great
B00ZH6IPMM|4|This is amazingly compact yet works as well as larger 12V models I've used. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the gauge on mine is not particularly accurate (or useful). I measured 33 psi in one tire with a normal tire gauge and when I hooked the pump up it showed 30. I thought, &#34;Ok, I'll just add two pounds so the integrated gauge reads 32.&#34; I turned the unit on and the gauge immediately jumped to 35 psi and then began slowly moving up from there. With that in mind, I allowed it to rise to 37 indicated (about fifteen seconds), turned the pump off, and the needle stayed at 37. I quickly removed the nozzle and used my other gauge and it had only added 1lb of pressure.<br /><br />I reconnected the nozzle and the onboard indicator now showed 31 psi. I turned the unit on and the needle again jumped up to 37 so I let it rise another two pounds indicated (so 39 psi) for another fifteen-twenty seconds, shut if off and disconnected. I checked the pressure and was now sitting at the desired 35.<br /><br />All of this is a long way to say, be sure to have a real tire pressure gauge handy to verify the actual pressure. It seems to take fifteen to twenty seconds per additional desired pound. With those two things in mind, it's hard to beat the price and the pleasantly tiny form-factor. Power cord length was sufficient for my sports coupe, though I'd think large sedans or SUVs would probably have difficulty with its reach.
B0002MABGE|1|This product fell apart, and fell on my dog the first time I used it.
B000BPVV1Q|5|Just what I expected. It fits great and look great!! Great price also. Makes it a breeze to turn quickly when needed.
B007XM6L6U|5|Cool...
B001BDSRTG|5|Made a little difference its quiet compared to all the other cold air intakes looks great under the hood and its nice and quiet
B009OBVRY4|5|Feels very professional in use. Readily attached to my old reliable variable speed Craftsman power drill.  I used the system on two cars: compounding out scratches on the newer one (fast, easy) and white &#34;age spots&#34; on the older car (more difficult and time consuming.) Haven't used it as a polisher yet. I would have been happier if I had been offered a kit with both compounding and polishing pads, or a choice of one or the other. Even so, it gave me professional quality results for a lot less than I imagine professional prices to be _ and I still have the tool for future use.
B000IHLZ5E|5|works as described, good to keep on your tool box
B007USCM7E|5|Exactly as described and at a great price!!!
B0045K2Q9Y|5|as expected, good value
B00DR14U0K|5|Hard to put on but looks great!
B00M9MWHXA|5|AWESOME!
B00EVQHSUO|5|That's the company's slogan, and appropriate. These horns are Very loud, a quality product !
B00F52ZLAC|4|It's a great filter
B000C0WKAQ|5|A very high quality belt that fit its application perfect.. USA made
B00PWG6AC4|4|This product works well, but the description &#34;2-pack&#34; is misleading. There are two pieces to this sunshade. Each piece is 34&#34; by 32&#34;. Together, they can block the sun for ONE large windshield. Even the size listing of 68&#34; x 32&#34; is somewhat misleading. If you want to block the sun, you will have to overlap the two pieces by some amount. Let me be clear: I am only protesting the misleading claim that this is a 2-pack of the size 68&#34; x 32&#34;. I like the sunshade, and I like the fact that it is two pieces. It is easier for me to position the two separate pieces of this shield onto my large windshield than it was to wrestle my old, one-piece shield. It works well for me. It's the first sunshade that I have found, which covers well the windshield of my Honda Accord.  Just understand that you are not getting two sunshades, just two pieces, each of which covers HALF your windshield.
B003HVZZU4|5|Great, works fine, relatively inexpensive
B00KXBOKXO|5|Really good quality!
B00700E8QA|5|excellent very happy purchase
B000CIPE9M|5|Nice bed insert.  Me and my wife installed it in less than a half an hour.  Well worth the money spent on the bed rug.
B008BX8GPY|4|Lights up very bright. Went through 3 car wash with no problems. Just didn't come with installing 3M mounting tape.
B00PGJCMME|5|Wow really looks good nice crome not cheap
B00M9MAJZS|3|Put on front and back disc of canam spyder.  They lift a bit so I do have to keep pressing down.  Maybe if the surface was perfectly flat it would work better.
B007L2JNT4|5|GREAT product and 100% fit. Better than mirrors costing twice as much. I highly recommend these. They do vibrate pretty bad but I'm not watching movies on them.
B0055UCRRY|1|Not what I expected. Had a difficult time getting it to stick to window.
B00LUGKNHI|5|Yeah, is what I need!
B002PUTC0M|5|I love this thing. It works great
B000WKAV2U|5|Bought 15wt for firmer ride on 1986 Honda Rebel 250. Haven't changed fork seals yet, so I cannot yet vouch about firming the ride. This brand is highly rated by others, so I decided to give it a try.  I'm pretty sure this is same brand used by a shop on one of my previous bikes. It served me well.
B000IYWXEE|5|This is an exact fit. Absolutely loving it!!!!
B000A3I26Q|3|I wish it was brighter.  When compared to most other LED products for cars and trucks, this is the dimmest thing I've ever come across.
B00S5XQ7EM|5|Exelent
B00PCKEYIW|5|This is worth the investment to maintain your Swiss diamond cookware.
B003IS3HV0|4|We used this on our leather couch and it makes it look new.  Granted, the couch is only a few years old.  I had to knock a star off because even though we applied it as directed the leather felt kind of sticky for a couple days after.
B004C6OBBC|5|Excellent
B000BQR100|3|It feels a bit cheap, but what can you expect from the least expensive shade on amazon?
B00H6BAZOM|5|Great replacement piece! It appears to be the exact same one as the factory key.
B00TH1VU7K|1|It was to tight and when I try to wear it, it cut
B00GSAUHB8|5|&#34;Excellent product. The seller also gives very helpful advice on using this product.&#34;
B000C9SR90|5|I am not sure what all I should I say. It fit into my 1998 Chevy Astro, it works, and my vehicle runs again. I am thrilled.
B00407VE7M|1|Very lousy spray paint can with bad nossle. Followed instructions, but did not come out good. Use at your own risk.
B000BYNGLU|5|So far so good, works as advertised after 3 months.  The light is a nice added feature.
B000CN9JJS|5|Were pretty good need to have better instructions so people can understand how to install them
B008S9QLLC|5|great product
B00P1LVCQE|5|Absolutely love it! It also arrived ahead of schedule;)
B004A0ZLSC|5|Great Price on this Item. I purchased this as a damaged item. Im still trying to find any visible damage.
B004GCKY9A|5|Good
B00FB7ZUFM|4|Works.
B001Q8DMIW|3|Low quality, you can actually see through these towels! There are good if you need a towel to clean grease or oil from your car and then plan to throw it out because I highly doubt they will survive one or two washing.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because I need something thicker than a paper towel to use when I work on my car, lawn mower, etc. but still throw it in the trash when done.
B00HDMEUCW|5|Easy setup, stays in place and best of all it works!  Absorbs sweat and is easy to clean
B008HSGYBQ|5|Perfect fit, lots of room
B0019SF5KC|4|Works well, not as bright as I thought it would be.
B00J00X3NW|5|Great oil. Use in my 3 cars.
B005HR1K46|5|good price, part as expected
B00GSAUHB8|4|It is a little short for my 2011 Honda Fit windshield but is plenty wide, and I can overlap it in the center easily so that it fits across the width. I'm able to press my visors against it to hold it up even though it isn't quite tall enough so I'm keeping it and using it. The materials are quality and it folds and unfolds fine (when I can make it work, my family sometimes has to do it for me LOL). The stitching in the case is coming loose but the elastic will hold it in its folded position just fine when the case comes apart.
B00CLLQYCE|4|Just what I needed
B000NKU13S|5|Excellent very responsible recommend
B00AM250CO|5|Very easy to install nice look
B001FEOSVC|5|World's awesome on my 2011 tundra.  Easy install.  Remove the spare and not the rear tires for easy install. Took about an hour and the hardest part was chopping the bump stops off. But still was easy. Helped a lot with towing the camp trailer. And ride isn't bad at 5 lbs.
B004L3FO9Y|5|Great Faucet!  So happy with the quality!
B000CO7BQK|3|As a D-I-Yer, I'm not sure I installed these right. There were no instructions and not everybody buying these is a pro or has manuals. A one page sheet showing some line drawings of a typical installation would be a plus.
B001GJ9K8C|5|Washed my car and it's looks like show room quality!!!!! Great product will by when out
B002N4GGNG|5|I love Valeo wipers.  They clean the windshield well and last a long time.  Easy to change.
B00UJ3KI5A|1|The plastic stems on the bulb are too narrow and the contacts don't connect anywhere within the housing for the bulb within the instrument cluster. I'd say they're only useful as paperweights but they're to light to even be used for that.
B000OCDYEI|1|Read the fine print before you order telescopic 40&#34; length
B004W5TJME|5|The item was perfect and matched the original fixture.
B000WJXCEU|5|Good job
B001PYR3VO|5|Worked perfectly
B000UODGIY|4|Work fine and are high quality, heavier than I thought they'd be too.
B004ALC6T8|5|just perfect, just like the factory one
B000CITK8S|5|Order this one for my neighbor whose battery kept dying. It's been a couple of months since I ordered it and no complaints
B006QLPDEU|5|Just as described. Came in perfect condition with no blemishes. Even has the double sided tape already in place.
B0007RDVE8|5|Brought out the luster in the Magenta Gray Pearl paint and made the gloss black stripe circumventing the bottom of the car along with the black spoiler, side view mirrors and trim around the convertible top &#34;Pop&#34;...
B00GARQKII|5|A lot less expensive than you'll pay in the store and the quality seams to be much better.
B000760FWU|4|Doing the job.  Could have been sturdier, but you get what you pay for.
B009YLT3QI|5|I love my roof rack!
B000CMKFLK|5|I've had the floor liners for a while now... about 6 years. I have them in the front (drivers and passengers side), second row seats and third row seats/cargo area for my SUV. They work very well at keeping the carpets underneath dry and keeping small amounts of liquids inside the liner. Definitely worth the money and the carpets underneath still look new. I also have 2 kids... the liners work very well.
B00062YYJ0|1|This was a waste of money. I have used MSD products quite a bit with success, but this just didn't work for me. It broke when I bent it on a 90.
B00U29M6SI|1|no place to mount
B00PJK9JKI|4|Kids love them
B00JIIZCM6|5|Works terrific!!!
B00E3OLYKY|5|It doesn't actually work but it's not supposed to it looks cool and made the back half of my audi more attractive
B005CD0T10|5|I use this to trickle charge a 12v battery for my automatic chicken coop door (a car antenna). So far, it works  a charm.
B000E5XQ2A|5|More power for sure added this with Borla exhaust at the same time. Great combo. More in. More out !
B000CIQ47S|4|Fits Perfect
B000C9GYN6|5|Excellent product
B0049IZSS8|5|WORKS LIKE IT IS SUPPOSE TO
B00GLLW3AM|5|used some silicone seals for water-proofing. works great for gigging light on small boat.
B00SQEI4GO|1|After over 5 hours to install on my Honda SVC600 scooter, it does NOT work.....period!
B004I69JZY|5|worked great.
B00XLWUO0A|5|Been using this product for years it a great sealant
B004UARNHO|5|I only buy McGard locks because they hold up well for years of service. This set is no exception. Their chrome plating is flawless and durable.
B00RAIK622|1|Can't even stick on the tank
B0013VT5N8|3|The cover worked okay. However it doesn't completely seal the license plate. So in inclement weather you will get water and moisture under the protective cover. But it does protect the license plate from dirt and very harmful corrosion items such as salt
B0006IX87S|4|Doesn't cause unacceptable water pressure and performs as expected for me.  The female connector has no way to thread onto a hose without turning the whole body of the filter, so pay attention to the order you assemble things.  I didn't the first time and ended up unscrewing everything and re-doing it in a different order (bottle onto hose first).  This isn't really serviceable/replaceable, so it is a throw-away when it reaches end of life.
B00JH6K8L4|5|Great item. Had no issues installing it into my 2014 Honda Civic Si. I purchased the 6000 and they are perfect brightness. Would buy again
B0009XT7NY|5|Can't believe I was able to use this to charge my cars old r12 system with r152a (canned dust off spray).<br /><br />hahahahaha.<br /><br />This can tap works great and seals nicely.
B004L5WEKO|5|bought for my husbands truck. he said he wasn't expecting it to be so nice and of excellent quality.
B00VH643H2|5|These Royal 100% Pure White Cotton Towels are absolutely great for cleaning from deep clean to light clean from your body to your car! I actually like using these towels as wash cloths in the shower as they are really strong and do a great job at cleaning my body with the amount of soap it will hold onto. I also like using these to clean my counters in my kitchen and in my bathroom. I keep a couple in my kitchen and a couple in my bathroom so that they are always close by. These towels are a really good size as they are 14 x 17inches and you get 12 of them. These are very durable towels as I have yet to have any problem with them tearing or breaking. These are definitely must have towels and they could be a great gift idea. I would definitely recommend these Royal 100% Pure White Cotton Towels!<br /><br />**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**
B00GQ2TC14|2|Instructions were followed for installation but no change. Turn signals where resistors were installed still hyper flash.
B00B9F307U|4|Fit almost perfect but I wish it came painted in the color I needed
B00HNMLQAG|5|kltech store replaced misrepresented product by TCBunny. TCBunny sells Junk!!!. and not real product KLTECH, replaced with top quality correct product  Make sure you get from correct seller kltech
B00JJYUFOY|5|Great!
B009HU7PB6|5|Got two of these for the front on my 2005 Hyundai Tiburon SE. They have been installed now for over a year and have held up beautifully. Would definitely recommend.
B00KHUQ9NK|5|Fits like a glove and looks good. A bit hard to get on, but worth it.
B002OUMVWY|5|I am very new to black tanks and sewer hoses! I can't compare this hose to any others. What I can say is that I have emptied my black tank twice now and this hose is great! I like the caps on each end of the hose. So for now, I am giving it 5 stars as I have had a good experience so far!
B00TQ07IOQ|5|Fits perfect and looks great
B0055EALW8|5|Great price , Fast shipping
B00004X13X|1|Should not even be sold, leaks and once filled with oil under your car it has no handles or proper handhold to pull out your now heavy oil container. Yes a piece of garbage. Also odd how BLITZ seems unconcerned on the bad feedback (I once called BLITZ and indicated the terrible design flaws)  as they continue to sell a defective product.
B000C2AC0E|4|What do you want,  Its a gasket!
B003BZKCX6|5|Perfect on Touareg
B001A03AX8|5|It works great job
B003Z9RFU6|5|Perfect Tonneau Cover!  Installation was super easy and the fit is perfect!  It looks really sweet and is watertight too!
B007Z8VG30|3|Kind of small but ok
B003SZON2U|5|Fit right, priced right, these worked out great!
B005HFYE1O|3|The relays work fine. Normal generic 12V relay. Definitely a must have for any installer/DIYer!<br /><br />The wire harness wire colors are all mixed up. The Red is Neg and the Black is Pos...Outside of the wiring issues, the harness is very useful for custom installs!
B005SWNPMA|1|It was definitely not worth the money I paid for it. I've had it maybe 3 weeks and the mesh is coming out and it is just a pain.
B007Z4XI94|5|This grille was much better than I thought it would be, considering the prices Land Rover charge! Fitted easily and looks really good. Be aware that it doesn't come with the Land Rover decal.
B00GIXF9ZE|3|they look nice wish it was actually metal not plastic
B000CQOIVO|1|Poor quality. Wheel melted and flattened & became unusable after only a month in storage.
B009DJXTJS|5|Fits and works as good as OEM.
B0038AW6NI|2|Really not happy with the headlights part.  Light projection/dispersion are not good, I think due to the reflective geometry.  I'll keep the rest of the assembly and try another headlight more in line with original parts.
B00R244NGE|5|I purchased some of the paint today and it worked perfect for my rear bumper and windshield wiper arms.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to restore their black bumper.
B00CQAR1OK|5|Very nice for the price.  At least as good of quality as the original.  Installed at home, no problem after watching a few Youtube videos.
B0002SQU9K|5|Good Deal!
B00CFALFXY|5|Soft, yummy feeling cloths.....I just washed mine and they look just as perfect as when I received them!
B008B9W0IC|3|i was good only that when I got it, it had a lot of wrinkles but the heat gun fixes it back as normal and good
B00GW3E7C6|4|I bought this to use when going on long bus trips to hold my water bottle and my Kindle. It is perfectly made to do just that, except for the straps used to attach it to the seat back. The directions require taking off the headrest to attach the straps, and this is not possible to do on a travel coach seat! My husband was able to rig it by tying the straps around the headrest somehow. I am going to try to sew the straps together so that they can just slip over the headrest for future trips. It was very handy aside from the difficulty attaching it to the seat.
B000COC0GQ|5|Love it. Works really well as K&N filters always do! :-)
B001DME4PG|4|great
B00U1SS5QM|1|HowPlumb sent wrong item. Never responded to my return request. It was cheaply made anyway.
B007NJOEAI|5|Works as described
B00RETZWQ2|5|Love these! So flag I got them!
B00480J4QY|5|Nice and bright.<br /> very white I like it....!!!!,
B00LIU44US|3|NOU
B00Y5N5ER2|5|Could not have asked for anything better looks great on my bike perfect size
B000EQ8XLI|5|fits ford escape 2008 2.3L gas
B009OBVS20|5|Maguiars products are great and easy to use.
B000BQWLE6|2|It looked like a toy not very useful
B000E4NB2G|5|Installed pretty easily.  Looks perfect.
B000NCOKQK|5|Like everyone else, I love this product. We have an older Vette that doesn't get driven much, but it's got some sort of parasitic load/draw that my other national brand float charger couldn't keep up with. I have an AGM battery and this charger/conditioner was built specifically to manage those (and conventional) batteries. I own four junior models as well (farm and lawn tractors, and one stand-by battery for an automated clay target trap) and each is worth its weight in gold, if for no other reason than the piece of mind. Great product and well worth every penny.
B000GZX2HW|5|This book is a must.<br />Good pictures,easy to follow instructions
B004W7KS18|4|I returned it for the bigger size receiver.
B003TQIIPG|5|The material sprayed without any problems, it covered over the scuffed surface easily and held so you could build several coats thick without any runs or sags and was a great bargain from Amazon compared to buying it at the local paint supply shop and the kit had the spray gun included in the box
B007WFA4T8|5|Exactly as ordered, sturdy.
B004WQ6QLU|5|I like it. Also it fits really well on the car. I highly recommend this mirror.
B000CH3S5A|5|Work good.
B00IMOAN7G|1|I replaced the rotors caliper bolts hardware and pads and the so new brakes all the way around Brakes squeaked hard since the install I gave it a week for wear in and nothing changed called the manufacturer and was told it could take up to a month for them to properly break in we are several months lather now and they still squeak hard in my opinion not worth the money at all will be buying a new set of breaks soon
B00695ZAYG|2|Not as pretty as it looks in the picture
B00BOU5G72|1|Leaked after I installed it. Thought maybe I just F'd it up. So I took it to a professional shop to fix, Still leaks. Went right in the trash. Not only was it a super expensive gasket, But it cost me a bonus of 15 qts of ATF.
B000WJWWQY|5|great product.. perfect fit and easy installation.
B0089GQLXW|5|This is an excellent stylish accessories to represent your S-Line, very High quality....<br />Now if also came in the black edition, I will be buying those as well...
B002RW244Y|1|Design has potential, but did not like plastic threads that stripped out while hand tightening. Also did not like not having felt buffer at all contact points with vehicles paint. Wedge for securing mirror to vehicle could use to be wider. Could not get tight enough to keep from being able to move assembly by hand. Had to return.
B0006PU7N4|5|Great kit. Well built and all parts came as described.  I put this on my 2003 S10 Crew cab LS. gave it a true 2 inches of tire clearance, allowing me to put Wrangler 31 x 10.50's under it. Solved my problem :)<br /><br />Definitely recommend.<br /><br />PS: I thought the instructions were both simple and straight forward and the pictures were spot on.<br /><br />Thanks
B000C2MAH2|5|Four Seasons 38635 orifice tube works great.
B00BH1FPJW|5|They look as good as advertised!
B000CMHVEY|1|This is not much of a review, I ordered a Hopkins 41165 Plug-in Simple Vehicle wiring kit from Amazon, for a Chev. Colorado and received a #43315 for a toyota!!!<br />NOT HAPPY!!!  Raturned it and bought it at Auto Zone.  Paid a little more but at least I could see what I got.  Product worked GREAT.  Dusty  Rhodes
B00LB9ZEIW|5|Kind of expensive, but perfect fit.
B0068C5J28|5|Don't waste your money on cheaper wiring harnesses.  This unit is more robust and is meant specifically for motorcycle applications.  The switch is waterproof, too.
B004OJZDAK|5|works well!
B004LYR4FK|5|Amazing!
B0031H3TPM|5|Filter works pretty good.
B0012WHBSO|5|I've kept this in the trunk and it's worked the two times that I've needed it without issue.  This is an upgrade over my old campbell hausfield compressor.
B000P17NXQ|5|Smooth stops without all the herky jerky of cheep controllers.
B00G620ZVU|5|Nice bright lights for my ATV.
B0040D2REU|3|These clips are not the best quality and the fit is not perfect.  But they will pop in if you push hard enough
B00RAS2YN6|5|Got here in time. Much better price. Very satisfied.
B00666FNA4|5|Item as described. Fits bike perfectly
B00N6SJK6I|5|looks great on the back just slide right on and your done fits tight.
B0081FMXMY|1|Failed after 13 months and less than 1000 (one thousand) miles of use. Engine stopped running while driving on road. Seemed to be a one-off event (no code), became unreliable after a few days, now will not start at all. Swapped in old (failing) OE DIC, car starts and runs. The ProParts DIC (bought from eEuroParts last year) failed one month after warranty ended. Good luck!
B00B5L5QJ8|5|installed this on my truck about a week ago and it works awesome. I had a SuperChip programmer before and i like this much better. I found it quite easy to install as long as you accurately fallow the instructions.
B00FKE44P8|5|Clear shows alot of dirt. Should have got the black But item is as described.
B00SUTHIVM|5|Quality is very good. Excellent purchase. Will use for many years.
B003XGYDE2|3|gets hot fast and takes too long to fill up pool floaties
B0077FJA20|5|Not a perfect fit but it is compatible andcworks
B002ZTMA6G|5|love it
B00KL3ALGO|4|Nice, sticks easily to the window.  It's too attractive for kids and mine keeps peeling it off and playing with it or hitting me in the head with it when I drive.  Gives the right amount of shade but you can easily still see outside.
B00CJ5DV2I|1|While the set up eventually works , it has major issues in poor manufacturing and validity of a &#34;good product for the money). The unit is simple enough for anyone who has the time to do that but you expect a &#34;more than an amateur product when you pay $50 or $75. I will highlight the weaknesses as a customer and a consumer to let my DIY friends know what they are buying.<br />1) The gauge is garbage, loose cover, rattles and inaccurate.<br />2) The pressure container is a cheap unit<br />3) The hose is too thin and kinks easy at the exit from the vessel. This should be thicker and in a spring to avoid flow obstruction or limit the location where the unit sits since certain elevations or angles kink the hose and stop delivery<br />4) Why not put a quick disconnect fitting on the pressure vessel to hose?<br />5) Why not the same for the hose end to cap?<br />6) Unless you wrap with Teflon tape and/or tighten hard, brass fitting will leak and lose pressure. That brass fitting is useless. Like IO said, it leaks and the weight will offset the hose down causing the outgoing hose from the unit to kink and shut off<br />7) Where is the bleed valve? When you finish using the pressure bleeder, a safety bleed device should be installed to safely vent a corrosive fluid. This is a serious safety concern since depressurizing via the pump will cause a squirt of a known corrosive liquid.<br />8) The Master cylinder cap is weak and leaks slowly. I found Aluminum caps but someone has to tell the manufacturer that Aluminum is not corrosive resistant, in this case, stainless steel is. Aluminum has the potential to give Hydrogen gas with corrosives which is flammable and can be explosive.
B0060DZ1QO|5|Great filter at a great price. I just purchased a used Suzuki Z400 and the first step I took was replacing the crappy Oem filter that the guy had on there. I am very familiar with UNI as I put them on all My bikes . Also purchased a filter for my sons quad as well and it sure allowed the quad to breathe.<br />Filter shipped very well packed and even included some stickers to put on my neighbors bumpers.
B001AVSIOI|5|Great for RV hitches; lock faces out and much easier to get the key in
B001VJS2FE|5|Somehow they still have not invented to gauge that guides my hand to het in position without fail. But once I do manage it displays the resault better then anything I have had - and I had a lot. Read the bad reviews so far mine is working flawlessly. I remember I had to play with it first time to figure how to set it. So basically it is a question, if I should take away a star for something, for something that nobody has resolved any better? (Fitting it.)
B00GSAUHB8|4|Light,  simple to use, keeps the car cool.
B0028QGTIG|2|Used this tool on my 1970 Chevy Monte Carlo. I would not recommend it for GM A-Body Cars - Chevelle, Malibu, Monte Carlo, Cutlass, ETC. I had to disassemble the tool to fit in inside my spring through the lower shock mount. I had to separate a hook from the top mechanism and the bottom mechanism and reattach them inside the coil spring with the very tip of my fingers(super tight). I could never get the tool to compress the spring evenly and had to re compress several timesto get the spring aligned and clocked correctly. It works... but was ALOT of extra work. 10+ year  Master Auto Tech.<br /><br />Wasn't badly built, but wouldn't work for my application.
B00KHA0SFA|5|Fits perfectly !!!!
B003YMVOUG|5|Perfect fit, 2001 Civic.
B0013U6Z6O|5|works great and in the right place.
B0083YDM00|4|Yeah it works for me in 2007 Corolla S. At-lease its not stock! This is the best one I can find.. Here is a before and after picture
B000C9FJAA|5|Fixed my problem with the blower works great just had to trim the blower housing a little for it to fit on a 1992 GMC
B002Y06TL8|5|As Described!!!
B00HU6N3LK|5|We used this on our leather couch and it did a good job of cleaning it.  I diluted it and put it in a spray bottle and sprayed it onto a cloth.
B00PTPW9F0|5|By using an additional o-ring, perfect alignment of the logo can be achieved.
B00L28Z2GG|4|On time and worked on my 1997 Maxima for reading codes and resetting.
B0081OSRQQ|4|Save your money on the kits and buy this instead. You will have to mix some soapy water in any household spray bottle to use as lubricant.  I tore out about 1/4 of the clay bar off to use and it was enough to completely go over an average sized import sedan that had never been done before.  Also you will have better results by not working in direct sunlight, under a cover is best. You can only do about a 2' x 2' area at a time due to needing to keep the area wet and being able to make multiple passes over the area for best results.  Also of course you will need to wash the vehicle when done before moving on to polishing and waxing.  It is amazing how much grit is trapped in the paint and how easily this works. It was my first time and pretty easy to figure out.
B009PHF036|5|Easy installat
B000CD57DK|4|Good
B000W0WSPI|5|Great tool to hold the water pump pulley from spinning, a must for any mechanic, diy'er or pro.
B000KPU8F2|1|It lasted 7 months when product failed and then had to be shipped back to Clore Automotive for repairs. Was not abused and still looks like it just came out of the box!! You would expect a reliable jump starter for $200 that would last years. The components used in it are the same used in the cheap $80 unit I got from Costco. So save the money because you are not getting the quality you would expect and will wind up wasting your time and money shipping it back and forth at your cost.
B000LG8GI6|5|I put 5 stars cuz it works for other people but not my car. I drive a toyota camry 2000 4cyl with power locks and windows. Tried many times. Customer service is excellent. Fast responding.
B000C808UW|5|Great quality and quck shipping
B00I7P3HL4|1|I received cheap stickers not the vinyl decal they take great pains to mention in the description. They are already well worn and not worth the money.
B00P2QAAG6|5|nicce
B000H2W270|5|IT WORK GOOD THANKS
B0012FD5J0|4|Well we did find out that even these don't stop the trailer from movement while someone is walking around in it.  Or as a matter of fact even if they roll over in bed.  The were easy to use but just didn't help for what we bought them for.
B00HJB53KA|4|little tight at first.. probably cried for about a month while they broke in. Overall great protection and a good looking glove.
B00HJS2OHS|5|Everything I order is on point
B0030553CC|4|Good for what we used it for
B002FS3MG4|3|The lower grease fitting rubbed up against the axle boot had to remove it
B00CEXKBS2|5|Great product easy to install
B0002ILK6I|5|does what it is suppose to do......start the bike
B004QBQYK4|5|Was quite easy  and works great
B008ZE1GOM|5|Best grease gun I have owned. I have utilized pistol grips for years as that is what I have always used and been told you need a pistol grip to keep the fitting on the nipple. While I have no problem keeping the fitting on the nipple at all. Better greasing ability also. More pressure so able to puch more grease with less effort.
B00HS5V900|5|We have barely driven 200 miles on these brakes, but so far so good. They are definitely better out-of-the-box than the performance brakes they are replacing. Time will tell if they continue to perform well.
B0127P0QV8|5|Coolest Deadpool mask ever ! Fit and feels great !
B0093NADRK|4|On time, rugged for what it is and works well.
B00ONDM07G|5|Great holder but needs to be strengthened up a little so it's not so shakey when using it to record videos on.
B00M78820I|5|I received your dashboard shade promptly and love it! Please tell your husband that I appreciate the films on how to fold it. I didn’t seem to get the hang of it until I watched the second film, and then it clicked. Best of all, I can tell a distinct difference in the temperature inside the car after leaving it parked in the sun for a good part of the day. It’s considerably less hot than it had been with the more traditional shade I’d been using. Love your product.
B005RNFBMC|5|Dries quickly. Little shrinkage
B000VKTUJQ|5|Very fast and great prices
B000SOKQSY|5|Love it
B001LHVOVK|5|Great product for the price. Went to autozone for code reading then got this same codes came up and this gas the erace mode also
B000K7JHWA|5|Very simple to use. GREAT product!
B0044XHW6O|5|Very clear.  You can see the personalized tag perfectly.  Would definitely recommend
B000CGRPX2|5|Awesome part, fits like oem qualility
B0076UPB9M|5|Have had for over two years and some wear but always get compliments and truly an original
B000C8ZJ9C|2|Did not fit the vehicle as it was specified to. Had to be returned.
B00029JXNO|5|Awesome!!!!!!!!!!
B00A71IJTG|4|as expected
B0013REXO8|5|WHAT A NICE FIT
B00PZDHSF2|5|Look amazing on the truck no one else has them!
B00R1RESBC|5|Love it... Have had many people asking me about it... Have had it for months and it still looks like i just put it on
B00851NNBE|5|Awesome product and works perfectly as a 921 bulb replacement in my travel trailer. The bulb throws a bright white light and takes a bit of getting used to if accustomed to the incandescent bulbs. I can now run all 10 light fixtures concurrently and do not here the invertor fan kick on like it used to.. Battery life has been extended as well.
B00519TARO|1|Doesnt have a chip in it dont buy
B00G6ENGXW|5|Worked Perfectly.
B00C7897TI|5|Put it on my sv after I knocked the bike over and snapped the original one off. Only thing I wish was better was more grippy knurls. Other than that I'm pretty impressed. Fit was great
B00VDFSRL0|5|Very nice product and very functional.  Was just what I was looking for and at a good price.
B00E59L7RW|5|Good replacement! Beats paying the price of an OEM unit!
B0007N20GM|5|AWESOME CLIP ! Fits perfect & stays on! SUPERFAST SHIPPING TOO
B004DK4P5O|5|Better than expected !!!
B00FXIHQGK|5|I love. It sets off my car
B00JGRVP84|5|Great rotors and brake pads. BEFORE ATTEMPTING INSTALL: You will need a special caliper tool to compress the rear calipers (Ford Mustangs).They require screwing in and pressing cylinders at the same time. I had to read (3) different blogs to find out why my calipers were not compressing. I bought the Caliper tool kit from Harbor Freight for $45. Best Youtube video on install is from CJ Pony. One of the spring clips came off the front brake pads during install and had to bend back onto stud. Follow the burn in process and the brakes will work great. I did notice better brake response and shorter braking distances.  They look awesome and Amazon has the best prices.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|I really like this sunshade ! Although it's a little too big for my windshield that's OK because I can push the extra fabric to cover all of my windshield and have almost zero sunlight leaking through !<br />I have no carport or garage so my car is in direct sunlight all day long. Yes, the car is still warm when you enter but there is a dramatic difference between using it and not using it ! For the most part, the AC cools the car remarkably quicker and that's why I'm a happy camper with this product !
B006YGG724|5|Well built and very sturdy. I love the look of this stubby bumper and it's a great price
B0099M2RYC|5|I've used this for years now. We RV a lot and live in our RV as snowbirds in the winter. it works great. But the KEY to it is never flush harsh chemicals or cleaners down the toilet. They kill the Digest-it bacteria that you want to keep healthy and active. Good stuff.
B00UHDTORA|5|Work perfectly for a much better price than local parts stores.
B00QO1ENMA|5|Great service and product
B00ELASYIA|5|I left the lights on the day after these arrived so I got to test them out. Worked great.
B00H2WXU6K|4|Looks pretty, stones fall out quickly. I was given extra but I dont have time to put them back on.
B001HNYW6W|5|Nice sound bumping against the other keys. Not some cheaply made key chain either, it's going to last longer then the keys.
B001DB99L6|5|Have a whole bunch of these for a youth group.  Works great!
B00825NB24|5|Seems very accurate to me.
B000FPZVBI|5|Perfect fit, works good, no leaks!
B002JH4GMK|5|Love it it replace the old one on my car
B001HX2N9K|5|Great deal!
B00UMTI3W6|3|So, the grease fittings on these are unlike any I have seen before. So I'm not sure how I'll apply new grease. Otherwise they seem solid, no problems yet.<br /><br />They do work with a 2011 Wrangler rubicon, Dana 44 front axle.
B0124B020K|5|I am NOT a Uber driver but I can definitely appreciate what it stands for.<br /><br />These are definitely quality made, and if you have ever had the window stickers that kind of fall apart on you when you are taking them off of the backing, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Please do not fall apart when you were taking them apart, so I definitely appreciate the quality that the stickers are made with.<br /><br />These are a great gift for somebody who is an uber driver, and now I just need to find one. Especially since I love giving gifts to people! And I have to say that I absolutely adore the fact that this is not one of those overly busy and bright ridiculous stickers. It's very plain, it's very simple, and it gets to the point. If you know what it means and you are an uber driver, I could see how this would not be a bad thing.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.
B002MGUO7Y|5|Perfect for my use
B006JXSVO4|1|grate product for  needs
B002G1PAZ6|2|im kicking myself even more.. i didnt realized i dropped $40 on this.  I bought it 3 years ago for a quick DIY but no longer needed it when I received it in the mail.  However, I figured I just add it to my garage full of tools.  Well today turns out I needed it.  Perfect :)... However, the thing was a disaster and completely useless.  The was a severe internal leak that was shooting out of the throttle.  Its too bad it looks really durable and the price sure made ya think you were receiving a quality product.  However, there are some good reviews on it so I guess I just didn't have luck with it.  I can't tell ya not to buy this; however, I can tell ya don't buy it unless you are certain you will use it right away.  Good luck
B002YBKTRC|5|This is a very nice emblem. Yes, it is plastic. For the price, you can't expect chrome. It's a great price for such a decent quality. My husband wanted this for his truck. Now our boys think his truck is slowly turning into a transformer. It's great! We got small ones for the side of his truck too. They are convinced that it won't transform during the day and it happens at night when no one is looking.
B00BZVYM98|5|worth the money
B00K6BR4LG|5|very good product
B003KMJPV0|2|These heads are bare no valves, no springs DO NOT GO BY THE PICTURES!!
B004FJPS5Y|4|Expensive for what it is, a pain to install...especially the covers on the middle piece, it will scratch the paint if you don't use a ton of masking tape. The can really should come with the roof rack as standard....like my old 2005 Odyssey. It looks nice now but you also have to spend another $100 to buy the cross bars....ugh!
B0068MVVP2|5|Fits in 2007 Sprinter 3500 diesel.
B000XY2W40|5|THANK YOU
B000PEZ1L4|5|Worked well for my use. Very pleased with fast shipping and received in good condition.
B00BUHTSYQ|4|Installed this on my wife's 2007 R56 base Cooper hardtop about 6 months ago. Seems like a good quality part, Much cheaper than buying from the Mini dealer. All metal construction vs. the original plastic (though I have read the new OEM parts are all metal... I'm sure the engineers just had NO idea that plastic wouldn't hold up past ~75k miles... /sarc)  Installation was much more difficult than expected. I think it took me around 6 or 7 hours. That's BMW's fault of course, not Airtex's. If you are averse to (or paying for) labor then maybe consider buying the OEM part, because if it fails then you will have to do the job all over again. I figured worst case, if I had to do it twice then at least the second time around should be easier, but so far it seems to be holding up.  Update: Nearly a year on, and over 15000 miles since installing this water pump. Still fine as as far as I can tell. I'll give it 5 stars if it gets to 60k! Unless we sell the car first...
B00GRRFLOK|5|I have been using this chock on my trailer for a couple months now.  I haul a gsxr 600 to the track 1-2x per month and have been very happy with this.  I am actually about to purchase a second one to bolt down in my garage.
B0001DRHFM|5|Awesome product keep all the water and blood off of me when i'm cleaning the deck! Would reccomend!
B000P0TZZG|4|I tried extracting a frozen stud with these. they gripped well enough to break the stud
B000AMXQDG|5|Lasting shine.... Great product..
B00L841M36|5|Can't go wrong for the price, installs easily adjusts easily.
B000Q7XN5G|5|Fit well in my 2009 Eddie Bauer Ford Expedition with split middle seat. Amazing how much dirt and debris is collected!
B001NZX5B2|5|THANKS
B003EP52BU|5|Does exactly what it is supposed to. Disappears when installed correctly.<br /><br />The one reviewer who had a complaint about the adhesive clearly didn't follow the instructions.
B00FRHOLK6|3|When these work, they work great, but I think there is too much arch because at times it seems to have too much bend in it and it doesnt wipe away the water in the middle of the blades. It cant be the wiper arm because it I also bought 2 brand new ones.
B004I0FBB6|5|Good quality and what expected
B007GREAAQ|5|It looks and performs very well... a little sticky outie as my right knee lives against it..
B002GJM5B0|5|Product was SUPER fantastic . FAST SHIPPING ! the tube heavy duty. WORTH YOUR MONEY!!! AWESOME PRODUCT ! ** BEST CONSTUMER SEVRICE ** i ever had online .
B00XRKV4UK|5|Great deal for air freshner junkies
B000MDZLR2|5|This cover is perfect for the spare tire on our camper! It fits perfectly and is really good quality.
B007M47SW0|2|Let just say if you this on a boat make sure you have a fire extinguisher. The wires are more of a 16-18 guage while it has a 14 guage insulation on it. All the wires I had on for my tilt and trim on boat didnt burn up or melt just everything that came on the relay harness.
B000MU8XI4|5|Just what I needed to lock up spare tire and gas cans in the bed of my truck for road trips.  I would highly recommend
B00KHUQDSG|5|I love it. Did smell bad in my car for weeks but I love it.
B00ZR3APNW|3|okay for the $$$$$$$
B000KYYMKK|5|I am pleased with the remote and i am going too purchase one for my chevy truck
B0040CVRGK|5|Product was as advertised and fit the electrical connector on my auto A/C low pressure switch
B00JH2GVLE|4|This was an exact for my 2009 Ford Escape.  Yes, there is a recall where they will replace the throttle body, but they will not replace it unless specific symptoms that can be reproduced on-demand occur.  I had the symptoms (stalling, surging, lack of power), but of course never while they were looking at it.  I decided to just replace the part myself (its super easy on the 3.0L V6 engines, it took me about 10 minutes, including walking out of the house to start and back into it for a beer after I finished).<br /><br />I took a risk ordering the &#34;cheapest&#34; part out of the search results, but its been installed for over a month (I do a lot of driving) with no throttle body-related issues.<br /><br />Delivery was fast as usual (thanks, Amazon!)
B002UC6OJ2|5|expensive but well made
B00X11N2QO|1|did not like fingers were too long sizing is off.
B00480BWCI|5|These are awesome.  So much better than the pile of boards that I used to carry.  So much easier to setup; far more flexible; much easier to get to exact heights I need.<br /><br />Going to order another set!
B001BBVB7S|4|great knob
B004PXAUGC|3|4 of them worked 2 of them where bad so eh still good tho
B002ZTKBT4|4|Awesome floor matts. Only downfall... THEY DO NOT FIT MY SCION COMFORTABLY BECAUSE OF MY CLUTCH PEDAL! every time I press the clutch pedal, it gets hung up on a little piece of the matt. So, on a pairs of $110.00 floor matts, I cut a piece off of the driver side so it wouldn't do it ever again.
B000RGYWRY|5|These risers put you in a very comfortable position to ride.  I love the position better than the factory position.  I ended up putting on the 2.5&#34; risers on. It moves the bars up and back towards you.  I can lean back and stretch out now.  I didn't think that they were an easy install for one person.  I think that if you have two people, it'll be an easier install.  I can't wait to take a long ride with these on the bike!  There is some confusion with the cables and the instructions.  I thought you were supposed to take them out, but they stay in their holder.  Overall, a great buy!
B000C5WBL4|5|good morning, friend before buying wanted some advice from you if indeed it is reliable and good product is remanufactured alternator and gives me personal opinion about it ... What guarantees and if it is favorable buying remanufactured or not remanufactured. thanks a lot
B00Q3SHJ1G|4|Bien!!!
B000RHZO7U|5|Awesome wrench
B0025CV8M0|5|Product arrived promptly and functions properly.  Satisfied with this item.
B007H2Q01M|3|I'm just not impressed by this chair. If anyone over 150# sits in this chair, it sags so their backside is sitting on a hard metal bar. If the chair is in the reclined position, the weight is distributed better and this does not happen. My other complaint is that there is not a cup holder or tray attached. I have another recliner that I bought in the same price range, and we do not have the problem with sitting on the bars, it has a tray, and it reclines in a smooth motion vs this one feels like it could benefit from some WD40.
B0086JICIE|1|too small
B004KLVJAA|5|An indispensable tool if working on older cars or doing metal work.  Allows you to insert a thread nut into a hole in a fender, sheet metal, etc. Especially invaluable when the other side of the hole is inaccessible.  I ordered a selection of rivnuts up to 10mm from ebay.  Very reasonable solution to a common problem. Also  very easy to use -- see youtube for videos..
B00335FGC6|5|looks great
B009IK7WQ8|5|Very nice! Fits perfectly!
B004D0ACYW|5|It fires up! Can't beat the price. American made. If it fails prematurely, I'll update the review.

B000GV7060|1|Kit is missing two shims for the jetting kit.
B009SAUU8U|3|Fits but not as pictured. Picture shows the dark gray but I received light gray. They do not match.
B00SLL5ESS|5|Works like a charm!
B001AWDX92|5|Easy to set up..always starts, at least for 1 year.
B001UP1F26|5|Better quality than the picture shows. Very impressed .
B00AKQAD88|5|ole lady loves it
B00OJ9MWUE|4|Wish they made some cardboard inserts for the bag so that you could make the sides rigid
B008427D88|5|Worked perfect for my 2007 Honda Odyssey front fender liner.
B000E24APU|1|temporary fix and peeled away quickly
B0015PK3AG|5|Priceless if you do a lot of oil changes. I use it almost every day. The best Toyota cup by far.
B00HLVMQV2|4|Works good. Does what I needed it to do. Keep dirt out when front windshield is up and closed
B008MCVHHI|5|a
B004C6OBBC|5|FIT PERFECTLY WITH PURCHASE OF ...Maxxtow Towing Products 70107 53&#34; x 19-1/2&#34; Compact Cargo Carrier - 500 lbs. Capacity....
B00NOIK4F6|1|Change the damn picture so people don't order the wrong thing!!!<br />If you order this you will get a spray hardener #739 not BPO for glazes
B005J6JRMM|5|the seat belt extenders work wonderful.  no agervation just snap snap and it's closed
B00JKSP41S|5|Fit and works properly!!! Easy install.
B00EEG8NHI|5|They fit my 98 Honda Civic perfectly. Simple and self explanatory installation. No complaints.
B00IKMBXY2|5|All good,  thanks you

B00ECSIMMO|5|Love love love
B000EPT79Q|5|Went through three different outer pinion seals for 05 rubicon wrangler that all leaked.  Finally found this one and it is a perfect fit with no leaks.
B000CRKG28|1|Would not even fit my car, even if you adjusted it all the way down to it's shortest position it was still to long !
B00K8HIHBY|5|Exactly what it was advertised as. Fast delivery. And a good price.
B002HVF7IU|5|Perfect product for what I needed, especially since I still had the old base.  Fit like a charm and now we have our passenger-side mirror back!<br />Would highly recommend, but make sure you have a suitable base to attach it to.
B00NIWLS6M|5|Exactly what I wanted. Installation took about 20 minutes and they look great. GM DEALER SERVICE WAS GREAT.
B0041LN1L4|5|It is working well and takes bumps from other cars well.
B00BZSE5CK|5|Looks good and fits great.
B00C2QSK8O|3|Ok pipe flanges didn't line up with exhaust manifold the greatest but got it to work
B00OT59TZE|1|did not fit just right
B00P1JFWVM|5|Works well not cheap easy to install.
B00P8EDS0C|5|Easy to install. Great price. Should hold up a lot better than single factory clip
B00P5YQWXU|1|Very disappointed. ...would not fit my 2003 9-3 even though it said it they would.
B00KTHUSJ2|3|OK I guess, but still no way to code the ignition kill code into your car without the dealer or a competent mechanic.  The button programming and the actual key cut are no real problem, but the last step actually cost as much in most areas as a brand new key done at the dealership only. Most dealers won't warranty this key; they want you to buy theirs ( which is probably the same one anyway ).
B00CKZLJUI|5|It was great my husband is a big florida gator fan and it fit good for his mancave
B0096SA03O|5|good price over dealership
B005OCZOPK|5|Definitely classes up the car!!
B0073MEN74|5|Great radiator a parts store that sold it,
B00CHT6TSO|4|Perfect Size and nice product!!!
B001AX9UD4|5|I used this on the connector pipe that goes from the catalytic converter to the inlet side of the muffler on a 2004 Dodge Grand Caravan.  I had trouble with this connection leaking when I used a conventional u-clamp.  The Walker 33976 fit perfectly and sealed up the connection on the first try.<br /><br />For some reason the manufacturers do a terrible job describing what these clamps fit.  In this case, the clamp fits over a slip-joint connection which is a connection where one pipe slides into the other.  The 2-1/2&#34; in the product description refers to the larger side of the two connections.<br /><br />Walker makes a stainless steel version of this marketed under the Dynomax name and the part number is 33226.  The products are identical except for the material used and the thickness of the metal used.  The stainless steel version is considerably thinner.  Nether of them use stainless steel bolts and nuts which surprises me.<br /><br />2.
B00DY939HA|5|Works great, I see no issues with this battery.
B000HVTERW|5|I use it to hang my uniform jackets in my cruiser. It works like you think it would. I have 2 jackets, and a coat on it.
B005GL86Z4|4|I am very pleased with this Z3 cover.  Considering the very low cost, it has exceeded my expectations!
B000CN71B6|5|Great replacement for a cracked PCV grommet.  Standard grommets won't fit an Edelbrock valve cover.  This one fits well and will stop the oil leak coming out of the old grommet.
B00CPKV8JU|5|bought this so that my girlfriend could ride long distance with out killing her back and bottom and now it never comes off the bike unless I put bike in for show , and more people we come across are going to buy this as well..it is awsome for those not willing to sacrifice the look of their bike but wants to have a passenger that will thank you in more ways than one after long rides.
B001KSAB64|5|Thank you,  excellent product.
B00SA8T7CQ|5|Ir is a great product
B007V6M9H8|5|Is perfect whit my land cruiser Prado VZJ95
B008AFO850|4|Difficult to find someone to cut these.  Order a couple extras just in case.
B0085IJVBI|4|was not identical ; but aliitle engineering  did wonders.
B008KZKFLQ|5|Better product than I thought. Thanks
B00EKEGRVS|5|love it
B007ZYVT5O|2|No black iridium . it come with clear . wrong description. :(
B00YC28OUU|4|They are just like the manufacturer grips, easy to install but no instructions included.
B00NN82Z2C|5|Great service and product
B00494G19W|4|Looks nice but they have quality control issues.  Check your frame carefully for surface defects once it arrives.
B00J1OFBM8|5|So yeah, these are 0% lower receivers. They are essentially a chunk of forged aluminum, and they make great paperweights. I purchased ten of them, because I am weird like that. This was the only place I was able to find them in stock, and they shipped out ridiculously fast. There do not appear to be any forging marks on them, so I am unable to identify the particular forge they came from. But, the quality seems similar to the &#34;big name&#34; forges, so I am satisfied.<br />Sadly, Amazon removed this item shortly after I purchased them, or I would have ordered more.
B00404WDUC|5|Exactly what I expected
B008Y8XHVE|5|Exact fit but not easy to install because it's all one piece.
B001CS4TII|5|Kit has everything you need for the job mounted great but i did have to drill holes in the side of the bed but not hard to do at all
B005BNZ0FG|5|Fits great !
B009DK79KM|4|Almost a perfect OEM match, but paid non-OEM price.  Because some &#34;S_B&#34; hit-and-run my fender, I needed to push out the dent on the fender for the screws to line up.
B00CMWDRHM|1|The description said they were compatible with my 2010 Jaguar.  I paid to have them installed in my car only to find out that you can't just install them.  This information should have been spelled out in detail to potential buyers.  There were similar units that would have worked just fine.  Now I need to purchase 4 different units and pay to have these taken out and the new ones out in.  $33/tire at the local shop.  NOT COOL!
B00HZQANPE|1|***2&#34; long*** just like it says if you read the fine print...
B001O0XMI2|3|My Acura TL 2005 now stops right where I want, but they make noise sometimes.
B001G7EA52|3|Very tough to go in for 85 mercs might want to check pricing at dealership if nearby
B00BXMRP4I|4|have been working great since I got them!
B009B6IPHE|4|Pros:<br />Arrived quickly<br />Looks expensive<br />Comes with different attachments to fit onto varying sized stick shifts (Fit my old 1992 Jeep Cherokee just fine)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Feels cheap. Isn't made out of glass or metal but plastic<br />Outer metallic piece is not attached to the crystal. You can take it off, but knob looks odd with just the crystal (in my opinion). If you leave it on, it will shake while you're driving. I just glued it together because it was annoying.
B00U8F5DBS|4|Undertray kit screws work as advertised.  They were worth the price which was not expensive, I recommend them to anyone looking for undertray screws.
B00C4B1F7U|5|Well made product and relatively easy to install.
B000CIT3N0|5|One of the best filters money can buy!
B004HYNG38|5|Great item that looks good and fit great on truck
B00CEO0E5G|1|returned them because the wide sides and top/bottom area hides too much plate information
B00AY250BS|1|maniac em alternator failed me within 3 months.
B00KTHXN1M|1|Said it would work with a 2013 Toyota Sienna that is not chip enabled, but after trying the programming instructions several dozen times it still wasn't even close. Took it into a dealer to program and they said if they programmed it and it still didn't work then I would still have to pay. Great product, but the claim it works on so many vehicles is misleading.
B00BN4AWTG|5|This is a very great HJC Helmet, much better than my old  Bilt Helmet especially my size was wrong inside. My old helmet liner said extra large but the inner base was really large. The only down fall with my new HJC Helmet is the Sun Visor's touching the bridge of my nose, especially wearing my glasses. But all in all, this hjc helmet is a keeper.
B00192JGA8|5|I mostly use this at home to keep my batteries charged up, cool my fridge before a trip, or just have general power in the RV while I load/unload/clean/etc.  Note that it is 15 amp rated, so if you plug it into a 20A circuit you have a chance of overloading it/causing it to get too hot.  You can't really run much in a 30A RV system, but it keeps the lights on and lets me run an oscillating fan while I work.
B007KCNBB6|5|Replaced the twisted steel cable. What an improvement.
B001GGS45K|5|I did read all the revues and asked a question about inside flaps. I was told that it did have them so I bought it. Harley Davidson wanted 91.00 for a similar bag. Sure that may of been made of real leather rather than the man made stuff but for a savings of about 67.00 dollars I thought it would be well worth the try. I am pretty much a person that wants whats right, From what I see so far I am very glad I bought it. Cant beat it.
B00SK7L0CM|5|Fit perfectly in my TD05H 16g and it flows well on my 2.5L Subaru.
B000AMBOIK|4|worked fine.should have bought automatic one.
B00154W454|5|This really lit up my license place, it is the cherry on top of my new car.
B005MZXUZ0|5|very happy with it.
B001GF0MRY|5|Perfect. Don't screw around with other folding shields - Covercraft makes the ONLY decent ones. They OEM for major manufacturers like BMW, they fit right, they're durable. Well worth the relatively high price - you get what you pay for.
B00O7FZBNK|1|This tool is the biggest waste of money,time,and metal. I got it in the mail after paying $10 for shipping and the tool snapped in half. And the other followed with it. And I opened the package and the tool was all scratched up. I guess you just get what you pay for.
B00IZYJXY2|5|Worked well on our wrangler. Rids smooth. There stock thred pitch is difrent from the spacer so just take not on when getting lugs.
B00065ZIJ2|5|Good product. Using it to this day.
B000PWZR4C|1|Second time I ordered one and it doesn't work
B000BXKZ6K|4|got the job done for a temporary fix
B00B3UYT2Q|5|Good for rim painting
B00JVUFDOS|1|Would have been nice if the site didn't lie and say it fits a 2014 Silverado. When they do not fit.
B00P12HZ8M|5|What can I say its a sticker that sticks LOL...
B00C7LU04G|5|Fit beautifully on my S80. Dropped the vehicle with perfect wheel gap front to rear. Very nice ride quality, improved handling. Car takes corners much better. Recommend replacing struts at the same time with Bilstein HDs.
B000C9HVUQ|5|Part was exactly whats in the picture, works great
B00D3298A0|3|Its okay.
B00ROCTTDQ|5|A+
B008XLGQM4|5|Looked really nice and fit perfect
B00CTVXUK0|4|Great replacement .... screw holes line up a little different, but still works.  Better then the crank handle!
B00471PQBG|5|My 2004 Nissan Pathfinder SE started acting sluggish and bogging when ascending inclines. It would rev to 5,000rpm just to maintain 40mph. It was throwing codes P0011 AND P0021 which point to the cam sensors. I bought two of these and went about replacing them. You have to remove the engine cover (3 screws), then disconnect some other sensors and cables to access the left (from the driver's view) cam sensor and either remove the coolant hose or work your way around it to access the right one. The sensors are held down by one screw and also have a green lever that need to be pushed down (pliers recommended) in order for them to be taken out. They are in there pretty tight so you need a flathead srew driver or something for leverage. To install the new sensors, I recommend lubricating the o-rings with some motor oil to facilitate insertion.<br /><br />My check engine light is still on but my car has gone completely back to normal. It actually feels smoother and the throttle more responsive than before the sensors went bad.
B00Y44N4H4|5|Very happy with product and seller very satisfied
B00VNJ15LK|5|Fits my 1992 bmw convertible very well
B00F9R6IPK|1|Junk won't last a year do yourself a favor and buy oem it will last much longer that this crap
B00OJF82GG|5|Totally loved it, and was proud to put it on my car!
B008054X0A|4|I bought the 2.5 inch baffles to fit into a set of V-H big round slip-ons that did not have any baffles in them.  I emailed Rush, and the CS Tech told me these 2.5's were the way to go with my set up, of Cat-less head pipe, and the size slip-ons I have on my bike.  When they arrived, they look pretty different than the pics of the product.  The fiberglass wrap is kept in place with plastic wrap and masking tape.  I tore off the masking tape but left the plastic wrap on to keep the fiber in place when installing them into the slip-ons, good thing I did that, would have been a headache, I figure, the plastic will eventually burn off to nothing, so no big deal.  They fit very snug into the 4 inch slip-on, took a 2x4 and a small sledge hammer to get them all the way into the pipe, and trust me, they are there to stay.  Bike went from loud open pipe sound to a low growl tuned sound, quieter than I expected, but still very nice.  I figure it may get a little more louder, the longer I break them in, but I am happy with the end results.  After I did a re-tune with my V-H tuner, its all good.
B0069VFVJO|5|Fixed a remote that I had taped together for years Love it.
B004GCGA8E|5|Better than expected.... bumper has been installed and painted... you can't even tell the difference!!! WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!!!
B00KTIT8TW|5|Worked great as a replacement. Should have done it sooner.
B00U6CBAEW|5|We have a fairly new suv that we are trying to keep neat and orderly.  I purchased another brand of trunk organizer a few months ago and it didn't last very long at all - with the edges ripping and sides collapsing on us.  That went into the trash and I bought this one.  What a difference!  This one fits perfectly in our trunk - we have 3 headrests in the backseat.  I think that material is of good quality and that it is well constructed.  There are different sized pockets for various things and it doesn't shift at all as the car goes around corners.  Definitely worth every penny and would recommend.
B0065FRBZ6|5|I like being able to carry my registration and insurance papers in case I get stopped. I got them in a zip tie baggie in case it rains. And it's big enuf to take a water bottle with me on those longer rides. On the photos, I hadn't received it yet.
B0067BNQGG|5|Amazing seat! I love it! I went from riding an hour and sore to being able to ride for hours until I run out of gas
B000CPIGMW|5|ALL IS GOOD
B001O7PNNM|5|Light scratches on a new metallic black car were completely removed with this compound. I had to apply it twice as I was afraid of over buffing. It leaves an amazing shine, but I also applied wax over the treated area afterwards to protect the area as directed.
B00L3SEP5Y|5|Reminds me of the good old days.
B00143SWNY|5|Worked like I knew it would.
B00HXCBVMY|3|They do seem to be waterproof, but it makes no difference if it is raining or not, your hand will stick to the liner and will take 5 minutes to put the glove back on.
B007RXBTI0|4|Use this for my portable AC.  The surface area is perfect and it is flexible to slide under the AC unit.  My only complaint is the flimsiness.  I tried to carry it full of water and made a huge mess. I end up using my shop-vac to suck the water out instead of trying to carry it.
B000UIVSC6|5|Perfect fitment, exactly as described.
B000CINV88|5|works well
B00ABZ7IDQ|5|Exactly what my husband wanted and works great!
B00JQZ3HBO|5|Good
B00U5IFY1W|3|Fits my 95 Sierra but it doesn't cover to much so it's not worth what they are asking
B00K889FCI|5|Works incredible well.  The Key is to sand the lens to perfection then use the wipe.  If you don't sand the housing and get ALL of the oxidation off the wipe will only work moderately well.  The marketing and packaging make the product seem slightly gimmicky but it actually works as shown. Definitely some type of new chemical not just new marketing of an old product.  Use in well ventilated area, the wipe seriously smells like a nasty volatile chemical.  Purchasing for third time for use on various lights.
B00NP61VDQ|5|I ordered these and the snow brushes for our vehicles this winter. They are sturdy, well made and designed and they have a great cushioned handle for better grip. My husband was delighted with it!
B00EA0ZB7I|5|These lights are just great! They are cheap an extremely bright! I have them on my duck boat and on my truck.
B003ZWE6W8|3|This item fits but is a tad loose.  Not the kind of fit I expect from an OEM part
B000C39C72|2|not that good
B0084L0YR6|4|Solved my problem. Blower motor would continue running after vehicle was shutoff. This module replaces the oem one and rectified the issue.
B005I3CRXM|5|awesome warm hoodie, that the size runs a bit big on. perfect for laying over riding gear or other sweatshirts. the design held up through lots of washing!
B00062YVKM|4|This looks nice and works well.  But, it would be nice if the mounting holes had some room for adjustment.  It was difficult for me to drill under the dash for the screws.  When I screwed it in, it was about 1/8&#34; crooked.  I'm a little bit of a perfectionist, so it bothered me.  I bought a small file and opened up some of the mounting holes to allow for adjustment.  Now it looks perfect.<br /><br />Installed in 79 cj5 on bottom lip of original dash.  Will use electronic temp and fuel gauge.
B00K1NS0PS|5|used this for my new led lights works great
B009DK0M7Y|5|Fit good just a little thinner metal then to orifinal tray on a 1992 GMC
B000CJ428K|5|Perfect Fit. 01 Civic.
B000WJ9YKQ|4|good value for Piaggip MP3 500 cc bike
B009LN4LMK|2|not good I m not happy
B002KCWWFC|5|quality product
B0006JO0XI|5|great
B00GJ1HUB6|5|Been in use for over 3 months with no issues. Easy to install. Saved a bunch of money doing it myself. I had to replace my air shocks after installing this compressor. It ran too often. Usually a defective shock causes the compressor to run constantly and results in the compressor failing. Check out the install videos on youtube to make the install easier.
B00NWB2LFG|5|Good product,  thank you
B0002L2MMG|5|Works perfectly ,tight fit for battery , between this and stock mic I'll be honest not that much difference that I can see but mic operates perfectly just remember its not an amplifier!!
B012ZZTDN2|5|This is perfect for those mornings when I am running late. I can now have my Cocoa Puffs while driving to work. My only complaint is that sometimes my cereal spills over when making turns.
B00D42AFS8|5|Tnks
B00MHW4XW0|5|Revised product failed in 9 months, less than 7000 miles on vehicle.Avoid    Original review: The fuel sender consists of a housing, float and a fuel pump.  This replaces the fuel pump it is hidden within the assembly housing.  If your gas gauge works you don't need the sender (float). Once the assembly is removed from the vehicle  it takes a few minutes to replace the pump and reassemble.  This is a delco part,  a Google search reveals this is made for the Mexican market but it is made in China as clearly stated on the box.  I have no doubt GM uses Chinese parts. Nothing wrong with that but your US deauler cannot order this part.  This offers a great alternative to buying the entire assembly.
B000FQ7IKE|5|Perfect match, fast shipping.
B00L1KSV1I|1|just came to office on bike having this gear under medium pouring rain.<br />my office is 8 minutes ride - but my sleeves and my ass are all wet !!!
B0002U2V1Y|5|High quality product. The towel is excellent and was an added bonus.
B0040505GK|5|A little large, but the next size down would have been to small on the knobby front wheels. Look sharp, durable. Straps are useless so I'll probably cut them off sometime.
B00B8ZI00S|5|It fit perfectly.
B001DCH3TA|5|This fit our Ford Escape perfectly. They came well packaged and we had the old ones replaced in less than 10 minutes.
B005WLC334|5|I install it on my 2007 suburban and it looks great love it looks factory install.
B006JF2Q3O|5|This lights were delivered extremely fast, but the only thing that seems odd is that the title states this is for a 2003 Honda 954rr, but the motorcycle only has 1 headlight, but yet you receive 2 sets of lights. So maybe you have an extra incase it blows? Also I had to do some fabrication in order for it to stay firm in place, it fits but is loose and I'm sure if I hit a bump it would move around. In the end it works and is extremely bright.
B00HS8X53Q|5|These are just what I needed. Feels like good quality. Shipping was super fast, too.
B005VOSTXA|4|Perfect fit. This panel does not come with the connecting fasteners. I was able to reuse the original bolts that were still connected to the vehicle.
B00HWI3RYY|5|fit perfectly, easy to install
B00BVB5HFA|5|Exactly like OEM, plug and play. I had it installed in under 2 minutes
B008Y2754U|4|I love it. A little higher than I was expecting, but I will adapt. Installation was a little difficult, but I managed just fine. Read all the directions three times before I started so that I knew what I was doing.
B0118PULPY|1|Check size chart 7 3/4is xxx and not offered
B0082CRG7S|5|Excelente
B00FQVWHTU|1|unit was too long had to cut end off to shorten then it almost didn't  work.
B0012X46X6|3|I ordered 2 struts 1 worked and the other had no pressure.  Make sure you verify the strut works before disassembling the one on your car.
B002ZWFUX8|1|Terrible design.  What can I say?
B00IJB51WY|3|drains quickly always needs to be charged.
B001DCN21I|5|good product
B00NF1QP1E|5|Fit fine works good
B002T75A0M|1|poor fit should have ordered the metal one

B007JWLE3E|5|Got one for me and one for my little sister and we both love it so much. looks amazing

B00WLMM55S|5|Just what I needed
B005PW6980|5|received as described, keep chains in place
B001DKM3SI|2|Searched Amazon looking for a Shawala. This item came up, so I ordered it.  Haven't used it yet, but will try it.  I have a strong feeling it will not perform anywhere as good as the Shawala.  Head is too small and not made with the same material.
B00BVQGFZG|5|A must have for any VW wrencher
B000CQBND0|5|No more dead battery on my RV!!!!
B000BZI4JI|5|Works perfectly with a Focus 2003
B00N25LLKI|5|Purchased for my son to attached to his backpack. Decal has great color and easy to iron on. Perfect for what we were looking for. About the size of old school floppy disk.

B00UUOGR80|5|Very fast shipping and very easy to use. Good price

B005LD2M84|4|easy install..takes some gas mileage away with resistance but it is just the right size...
B00C8HY1JY|5|WorkS as expected, will update how long it will last.
B0006PJAGE|5|work real good
B005EXWR7C|2|The bulbs are not error free and also they flash on engine start. You will need to program out the error code etc  so more spending
B001BRTH6Y|5|I like the noise it produces.
B001B7TSV8|5|Excellent product for the price.  Considering getting a second for the other side of the truck bed.
B008032PKM|5|I am not sure what to say. It fit, it works, my vehicle runs again.
B001AV1WP0|1|way too small!!!
B00O81BMW2|5|Very simple to install by very effective.
B00JHEG7UC|5|Work great
B006BNTK1A|5|Gotta love them!!
B00X8JSYS0|5|Great fitment and received it in time
B006VZG5X4|4|Fits and looks cool but my only complaint is it should of came with the rubber rings for the screws in it so I had to remove those carefully from my stock windshield and put it in this one. But works.
B00FMGSZ9A|5|Love is all you need!!!
B007Y558Q0|2|This sun shade is pretty cheaply made and only barely fits my windshield with over an inch exposed on either side. I suspect it will fall apart fairly quickly, in which case I will purchase a higher quality replacement from another vendor.
B00RW7WB38|5|Good blades.
B00MGFG1TQ|3|ripped a seam on the 2nd outting
B0066QMMDA|5|I searched before I purchased this and most reviews had problems finding the right size for their hyundai elantra. I have a 2013 elantra and it fits perfectly. No problems at all when installing.
B003976XL6|2|This product did not work for the materials we were trying to use it on. (Aluminum and acrylic)
B00VBRUT0W|4|We have a 42 foot toy hauler and fits well. Not liking the new snaps one broke first time we used it. The old snaps seem to be a better quality snap. Otherwise fits good.
B001ROPFNK|5|Great
B00SXE4GI2|3|I haven't actually used this yet because I have to cut a hole in it for my antenna in my 2014 Mustang.  It seems like it would be a great product for Florida, but I'm hesitant about cutting a hole in it.
B00KGGTF9U|3|a bit small for a Chevrolet Sonic(for the verticle side). and the material is not very good for reflection. It is OK for the price and convinience
B00EIN1G76|5|Best light/charger EVER!!!
B006QGD996|3|Need better handles.
B00CYLWV6E|5|My happeseat is fantastic. I'm ordering a second one soon.
B00MEYYLZA|1|This button is not the correct part for a 2011 SeaDoo GTi
B000C44DJI|1|Purchased a set of two strut mounts and bearing kits.....one box was new and fully sealed, the second box was pretty old with the inside bag cut open with the mounting nuts missing or stolen by the previous purchaser. Had to return the product which was handled easily by Amazon.
B00ASWPUFK|5|Love it
B006V85N70|5|Very nice!
B00PT18QAQ|5|Timely delivery, quality product
B009774GCA|5|Does what I need it to
B00JSKIVLS|4|Looks awesome on my truck
B009YWIQ5G|2|You get what you pay for, but for something that will stay on for the life of the car i would have paid a little more for quality. The emblems them selves are hollow and stick using foam double stick tape which are as thick as the letters them selves and are very noticeable
B00FOX5D9Q|5|Worked great. Solved the problem of the lights on staying on because of my daytime running lights on my 2015 Kia Sedona
B000BL10T8|5|Great part---replaced my old lenses earlier year, and have been satisfied with the result thus far!
B001LA34VA|5|WIFE LOVES IT
B004O2DI36|3|This is a mattress cover, not the actual pad.
B001IF2BDU|5|Really like them!  They look good and do the job!
B00MW8G99O|1|Did not work as promised with my EX model CRV 2004
B009HDQC8A|5|Just as it should be!
B00I5G40DO|5|Love these switches.  I have 5 of these in my truck for light bar.  Rear lights.  Train horn.  And compressor.  Out of all of them. Only one has a loose connection. And the top part doesn't fully light up on the rocker hand switch emblem.  I just gonna  reorder that Switch .  All in all. They light up great.  Have a great click to them.  I also order the plastic housing that they sit in for a more secure and better look.  Very very happy with them
B007PJD04C|3|I do like the concept for this windshield. It's nice to be able to drop when the raining starts so you can see where you are going however be very careful about cleaning. I use a very soft cloth and a very soft cleaner but if you have any bug splatter that is hard you will wipe scratches in your shield. My original shield did not do this.
B000BQWLE6|2|way smaller than I expected
B000CMJ2KU|5|every driver needs on of this in your trunk! work well!
B004JO5RCO|5|Item arrived as promised; speedy delivery as well. A+ customer service. Thank you!
B00EAJD8LA|4|worked well, correct part, would have liked longer pigtails on the end
B00C1YI2XA|5|Awesome! The light is so bright!!
B00F9LPKJ6|5|Lead Acid batteries are so gone!
B0012QBWIA|4|Good price.
B00080QHMM|5|The original and best. I had an older one that didn't light up red like this one and it lasted about 8 years and i replaced with others that just didn't cut it for accuracy. Glad to have a gauge that you know is correct. Nothings more frustrating than when you are either monitoring a slow leaking tire or matching four tires up on a vehicle for even pressures; to not know if the gauge is working correctly.
B001NZZMA4|5|good long lasting quite brakes
B00VNBDWPK|5|Very easy to install. They illuminate objects short and far much better than stock. The temperature is perfect, white and bright. I love that LED's don't need to warm up like HID's, which I've had terrible luck with in the past. No need to elaborate on that here. The pictures pretty much speak for themselves as does OPT7's positive reputation.
B00XCKU6UY|2|One Was A Perfect Fit The Other Was To Big
B00LF73I2Y|3|Result is mediocre. Price is much too high for something you can accomplish with factory touch up paint and a run of the mill can of 3M adhesive remover in lieu of the &#34;blending solution&#34;
B00XVZYTLM|2|some of the lights flicker
B00MJ4504Q|2|The glue strip on this item wasny as good as i thought it should be.
B000BYB7SO|5|Exactly what my Auto Needed.  Thank You!
B00JBIBGSM|5|Durable clear plastic, nice black highlights, and for the right price. Every thing fits well. just perfect.
B00C5W8DYQ|5|Awesome bag, good space and compartments. Suction cups make it perfect for the Honda NC700X which does not have tank in the front. Only wish it were a tad bigger or expandable but not enough of an issue to even mark it 4 stars. Good quality construction.
B007LIBYTA|5|This is a very cute item but it is not purple it is black well could be and really dark dark purple but you can't see that in the Sun. Does not block the registration tags for your car either.
B002H3DSRA|5|So far so good. Been on our car for a couple months now and still looks new. Wish it was smaller but nobody seems to make them for a decent price any more.
B000C11JJI|5|Great fit
B009XG714K|5|NICE! Great quality, nicely finished & great adhesion! This is how ALL Carbon fiber products of this type should be! WORTH EVERY CENT (You get what you pay for).
B00F9RNIPI|5|Great cables! Rock, rolls up nicely, and gray case. Thanks! - doc
B000CNBCB6|3|I love how easy the fronts were to put on, but not a fan of the back at all. There is a gap at the corner of the visor and the window seal. With any wind driven rain, water will come inside the car defeating the purpose of the back visors. I'm going to have to put silicone in that gap and hope it doesn't get the window also. Also, the windows close very slow with the visors installed.<br /><br />Will update as time goes on and they get used.
B0014SQVA0|4|Arrived timely and the product was not damaged.
B000ELAZ6E|4|This was a great fitting cover.  It's work to install I think it took about an hour but looks great and stays put.
B00KQHJDB4|5|For older car owners this is a God send. I wasn't even sure they made these any more but I am glad I found them. I just hope they keep making them.
B00NFSNAS8|5|This compressor works equally well on 110v or 12v.  I am very happy with my purchase as it is much more powerful than my old 12v pump.  My tires filled up much quicker.<br /><br />I sent a question to Kensun and received an e-mail back within 24 hours, this is what I call excellent service and support.<br /><br />Based on the versatility and quality of the product, I purchased a second unit for home use (balls/other inflatables).<br /><br />David W.
B009EVOVFQ|5|I have a 4 door sahara unlimited wrangler and I have speakers that will blow your clothes off, (im female) lol so I needed to conceal the bass and subs back there from theft plus from the elements since I usually drive with just a bikini on it.  It works like a charm. Love that Best top made a more affordable line of products that are still great quality. Plus their customer service is EXCELLENT!!!
B009R4PE4M|5|Have  not used yet but worked well last winter.
B00KN0UOEE|5|MAKES MY CAR LOOK BRAND NEW
B00803BIAU|5|look great and enhance the vehicle
B000C5UFVM|5|We purchased this oxygen sensor because Auto Zone recommended it as the correct one to replace the faulty one on our Honda Civic Hybrid.  Auto zone wanted $120 for it, and our local Honda dealer wanted $135 for it plus $300 in labor to install it.  We purchased it for $94 including shipping and had a local garage install it for labor only ($100). It worked came in promptly, worked perfectly, and saved us quite a bit of  money.  Yay!
B000C5FULW|5|Works great
B00ABQUWVA|3|It looks great, but the only thing I don't like is there is a transparent rectangle that forms around the picture from where it was cut which is noticeable on the mirror.
B00OWS4N22|5|Received this as a birthday present from my wife after she watched me climbing into my pickup with the tailgate down. MUCH easier to climb in and very easy and quick to install. Wish I had this years ago.
B00M9MWHXA|5|Get some short torx wrenches if working on sportster 72, otherwise the rear lights are a pain. Other than that awesome sissy bar, i love it!!
B000AUMTZY|5|What year car do dey fit
B00MH8UU5I|5|Just as good as the one I bough from a Jeep dealership. I just got it maybe an inch or two too big. But its fine.
B0001YIUZC|4|Works fine.  Got what I ordered.  Could have been cheaper and stronger for the price.
B000BGM2XG|5|Replaced broken fixture in our old trailer. Works great!
B00H42WKNW|1|16000 miles later the ball joint is junk on one, the other the bushings are wore out.  Can't recommend at all.
B000QABFV2|5|Go Sox!
B001HQBB72|5|great
B00ASMWP0I|5|Arrived in a timely manner and battery was everything it was supposed to be.
B010N7RW2S|4|I do commercial HVAC and travel about 100 - 200 miles a day. Drained batteries are a norm for me. Having this in my truck makes them a snap to deal with. Bought it a couple weeks ago and after the first week was already able to use it to jump start a stranded mans acura no prob. It was simple to use and an extreme time saver rather than having to get the vehicles close enough for jumper cables. Works great as a charger too. My only gripe is that you have to use the power plug they provided to charge it. Either from an electrical outlet or a car 12v plug. I don't know why they couldn't just put a micro USB charging port like all other external batteries but it was kinda disappointing to see. The case is nice, it has a thick insert pad where the battery rest when not in use. The other side holds the jumper cables and charging cords. It is a big carrying case and is in no way small, be sure you have room to pack it. And finally the light is good and has multiple settings which is nice but I haven't needed to use it much other than to make sure it works.
B00RDMBTNA|5|Excellent product with no real flaws. Retained suds well and cleaned well. This product is much better that the cheaper versions I have used in the past.
B00AT5CYPA|5|Excellent euro replacement. Shipped very fast. Direct fit with stock wiring. Just unplug the old, plug this one in.<br />It feels a little cheaper than OEM, but that's fine. You won't notice after its in.<br />Has off, running lights, headlights. Pull out for fog, and pull out farther for rear fog (you'll need different tail lights for those)<br />Pro tip. You can bend back the third prong from the right on the top row labeled TFL, to disable the headlights being on all the time.
B007ZGKKMA|4|Plastic lense. But hasn't changed color. Very bright. For the money I think these are really hard to beat.
B00XZ9PDXW|5|It works ! In this high tech day and age one can not be too careful. Went to dealer for the laser cut and saved myself $30 but getting the key myself.
B002XL2HVO|1|Very small and cheap.Not what I was expecting.
B0082365AQ|4|Smells horrid
B007EEVK8G|5|Had to self modify but works great on bike
B006V7TBBA|1|The light worked well before it fell apart on the highway. Rock shield fell off, light fell out of the housing. You would think the power connectors would have been enough to hold onto the light but nope. Now I have a working light on one side of my light bar, and an empty housing on the other side.
B00009PGNS|5|Works great. Kept our food and water cold on our last trip of 4 days in our car and hotel rooms. We have the power pack so we can plug it into the wall plug at the hotel.Holds alot for it size, we had lots of room.
B003SYXMA0|1|I installed these per the manual.  Torqued them with the car on the ground.  Within 600 miles the bushing in the Left lower arm was torn, and the car felt worse than before I started.  These are cheaply made chinese parts.  To top it off Amazon won't return/replace and it hasn't even been 30 days.  Junk.  I should have just bought urethane bushings and put them in the stock arms.
B002R4NJ8C|5|Good
B00ARJQLGG|5|perfect fit, way cheaper than any retailed store.
B00FU8PJMG|1|Arrived crushed. 😔
B002NGOMF8|4|Purchased this product due to an independent study that resulted in this being the most effective additive for the dollar.  Only complaint is that I find it difficult to meter the amount I need to add to my fuel because the container is pretty small and not marked for metering into small fuel tanks.
B00MDAJJ34|5|KCCO, just as expected
B003OSIHXW|1|The same experience as many other reviewers.  The rubber portion becomes separated from the rest of the wiper blade.  It is a poor design.  I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing.  Hard to believe that wiper blades have been in used for many years and all of a sudden someone like GY manufactures (or puts their name on) an inferior product that you can't rely on when needed.
B00VLG5R28|5|Very good.
B003NS5NK8|5|Wow! This product removed all clear coat scratches from my car
B00NJ5EUHC|5|Awesome product
B007S0GQ3A|3|I ordered two UA lanyards. One for me, one for the husband. One was a UA (as ordered) and one was a Subaru lanyard. The husband refused to use the Subaru one so I got it. I don't own a Subaru so I feel kinda stupid carrying it around and someone has even asked me if I drive one. Oh well, for as cheap as they are, it's not worth fixing.
B00348CWO2|5|Love these. Put on garage & they look great!!
B00BI3NAYQ|5|I'm a gun collector I thought this was a brilliant idea much better than the stupid regular family stickers you mostly see on mini vans with the father mother all the way down to the mutts.
B0034Y2V3I|4|Higher grade oil filter which is compatible with full synthetic Mobil-1 oil!  Use them on all my vehicles.
B007ETLKG8|5|Good for what we used it for
B005G3W284|5|Does the job perfectly
B00SXE4GI2|5|Received in a very timely manner and it was exactly as described in advertisement.
B000SBCHCA|5|Works great when you need to extend your OBDll plug.
B000V5L5SK|1|Not happy. Did not fit well. Wondering if it's really a Honda product.
B008AFO850|5|Good replacement
B00ULR4L6Q|5|Great sticker
B00NB8TYJQ|5|Great price and quality would recommend
B00X3IJBIS|4|Everything with my order fit perfectly and it help bring my motorcycle back to show room looks.
B00NOL6RSG|5|Perfect for firefighters responding to the station. I would not recommend it for fire police or any other vehicle that needs to be seen from all angles because this light is very isolated to being seen from the front of the vehicle.
B007ED84XG|5|Works really well it's super cute and collapses easily!!
B00XPTJ91Y|5|Good
B00LX28WAO|5|great
B00S10MEGY|5|New look for Genesis 2015 Sedan.
B00651C4EI|5|Great product, changes the look of the vehicle. Very sturdy.
B004I106KQ|5|Exactly what I need,
B00FFAX7MI|3|They did not come with screws. I had to pay a locksmith 10€ to drill holes in which metric system screws would fit since I ordered from Europe. There is also no backing plate to secure them better. Keep in mind when buying.
B00651CLCS|4|Clean look and super easy install. I would have went with a little larger one since some stations don't come in clear, but it does look good and no more long antenna bouncing around in woods!
B009DJ3628|5|Nice air filter. Got a slight jump in mpg along with removing the stock airbox. Filter stsys on with little modification.
B0046MVWPU|5|Fast delivery.  Works great!
B004NBKNM2|4|Exactly what I needed!
B000VTSD1I|5|Fair price and rapid shipping.  Installed easily and works well.  When not in use it is hardly detectable on my 03 Mercury.
B005PZMKZI|2|Does not fit my car. Way to difficult to try and strap under the seat.
B00KSEUX6Y|4|Love the key entry. Felt lost without one. But need better instructions on how to activate it. Tried 3 times with the instructions they gave me and finally had to look in line to get it activated.
B006GGI79I|5|Was able to fix the mirror on my car for a fraction of what the dealership was going to charge.  It was east to attach and works as designed. So glad I made this purchase.
B00VVWTZAW|5|Awesome great product no issues thank you
B00OQNL6SW|5|My car rides great.
B00EVLICD6|5|These were easy to install and look great on my 1997 F150 Lariat
B002WMGJPY|2|It shows in the picture that it's a seamless back. I needed it SEAMLESS. It's clearly going to be southern Arizona contaversy vest
B004ZG8O8K|4|Although the description is inaccurate on the point the terminals are crimped on on end, I can assure you are better off not having them on for ease of pulling wires through most handlebars.  For me, it was a bonus not having them crimped on.  My workplace had a crimp tool and installing them after the wires were pulled through the bars was a breeze!  Only one OEM wire didn't have a corresponding color match but that also was no big deal for me.  Overall, I'm pleased with these.
B00KLKC20K|5|Brand new, perfect functioning.
B000C5C862|1|Amazon said it fit my truck but it did not.
B00B17ACAO|5|Tough!  Cleans easily, and look great!
B00TRS3NXW|5|Bumper came in time, just as described, fit on my Mazda 5, loving it.
B00TKRLZNA|1|No where near bright enough
B001TNX0IQ|5|smells great doesn't last long...this is why I try to find it the cheapest I can.<br /><br />why a 5 star well cheapest I found and I love this smell'<br /><br />And yes it came sealed in its box
B000XQ2S4M|5|Arrived on time, has worked great!
B006570GMY|5|Perfect in every way.
B004DRXG3O|5|I like them
B003CH3Z8W|5|Works great with PC DA polisher and lake country pads!
B00BCRM9RM|2|very cheap material.  But I guess you get what you pay for.
B0076GSA8U|5|Works great, appears to be high quality.  No need to spend more on another brand.
B000C9RQLA|5|Keep It original with AC Delco
B004HIEHDM|1|Tint was cut wrong way off of roll. I had some guys come try and install it instead of screwing it up myself, and they pointed out to me the difference in the way the tint NEEDS to be cut versus how it WAS cut. I threw this s*** away, decided to hell with it and had them install their own 5% limo tint. I would decide against this product.
B00II8GS0W|5|Light was identical to original.  Fit perfectly and works.  Installed on 1978 Kawasaki KE 250.
B009LJLOUQ|4|Instruction are decent enough to understand but only pictures. However front pad holes does not line up but back pads does line up. I drilled 2 holes to these gaurds and alligned with factory. Looks nice on my 14 durango....
B006N94Z6M|5|Went on good. Feeds solid.
B006WQSD1O|1|Purchased a pair less than a year ago mind you less thank YEAR AGO had them put on by an AES certified mechanic and when I contacted the warrenty department the rep was rude from the beginning and after she telling me all these hoops I had to jump thew .. I asked to speak to a higher authority and she refused and kept putting me on hold and kept telling me that her supervisor was too busy .. Now what I'm confused is that I'm the consumer and customer service is a must now a days WILL NEVER BUY FROM DETROIT AXLE THAT SHIPS IN A &#34;&#34; MADE IN CHINA BOX &#34;&#34;
B000A3BXZ8|5|Looks really good on my 2012 Ram 1500 ST. Just a heads up though, you will need an upholstery tool or screwdriver to get this on. The steering wheel will feel a lot bigger at first. It's really nice leather and adds some grip.
B00096S21E|5|Great price
B0043063JU|5|love it
B000C7WVUI|5|Easy Fix!
B00497DTG2|1|Had to trim down the hose too much to fit, wasn't expecting that.
B0066S2HYW|5|This part was exactly what we needed.  Now the car is up and running again.  Perfect solution.
B00MO0UEIC|5|This license plate is absolutely beautiful.  I have received many positive comments about it in the short time I have had it :).
B00IAC19FA|5|This fit and work just great
B0014BBPA8|5|Car stops nice and smooth now like it should, but only time will tell how long they last. The factory rotors on my Legacy lasted around 35,000 miles before they warped. I hope these last longer.
B00252GGM2|5|Item as decribed.
B001CE4HY8|5|great
B0089K6J6C|3|Still trying to connect.
B002EIJLII|5|Great product. I use this filter on all my cars.
B009DS1BV2|5|Great choice
B000E3BVSS|3|I wish they were fully adjustable. these have pre-stitched lengths you can choose.
B00UM58RUI|4|Well, it looks nice.  Who knows if it actually protects all that well. It's sure better than not wearing one at all.  The strap is the D-ring style which may take a bit more effort to use but is probably a lot more likely to stay together in the event of an accident.
B00IYXDHQE|5|puts the resQme window cracker on the visor for easy acces if you ever need it
B00NOLEM7E|1|Came broken, so small and light is difficult to think it broke in transit
B0016KA90Y|5|Received it as described, fast shipping, installed it by myself, functioned properly, very happy of my purchase. Definitively will give this product more than 5 Stars. Sit well in my CX-9
B001C98168|5|Good quality. Exact OEM replacement.  They recently updated these filters.  They now have a bead of silicone going across the back to keep the fins equally distanced.  The color of the rubber is now orange instead of black.
B00KSLLNOS|5|Fired right up great deal
B004OK77L2|4|Have had this in use most of this season now.  Two months of solid travel, moving almost every other day, unhitching and hitching my 30 ft, 8500 pound trailer, with 900# tongue weight.  So far no problems with lifting the tow vehicle hitch for w/d hookup.  I really like the quick extension feature which saves putting a bunch of wood blocks under it (I still use at least one). Certainly enough power, but wish it would be a little faster.
B004RCX64Y|5|Exactly like my originals. Amazon prices were lower than everybody else.  Motor home looks like new again. Highly recommend.
B00CULEPDA|1|this thing is junk!! and never correct!! waste of $$$!
B000JWKMB6|3|Not exactly what i was looking for
B000KZ23LY|1|Working intermittently.  May need to send it back.
B00NH0Y4I4|5|I really like this cover a lot.a internal rotor ignition would look sweet.it gave my Motoped just what it needed.it does cloud up if water gets in it so after you hose your bike down take it off immediately
B00G620ZVU|5|Fast shipping great prices
B001DRBY40|5|Great value.  As described.
B00EAMA2EI|4|Mopar. Enough said
B005PUX0YI|3|Happy with purchase given the price.  Would purchase again.
B00AZMBD4U|3|Although I have not installed these trunk lid lifts yet, they appear to be a good product. The only complaint I have at this time, is that these lifts seem to be a StrongArm Lift #6171 (part # is on lift) in a ACDelco package. If I had known this I would have ordered the StrongArm brand for a couple less dollars per lift.
B00FMV0WFA|5|Fit perfect and still has good amount of space underneath.
B000BUU5WW|4|Haven't used it yet but looks well made
B00KTI09FE|5|Did the job.
B00F0QAOOG|5|Perfect fit. Great product as to be expected from Avs.
B0064OONG8|2|I purchased this so that I could have a spare key for my car.  It works to open the car but is missing an immobilizer chip for cars that have anti theft.  I should have done more research before purchasing but now am learning as I go.  Just wanted to leave a comment so that future customers know that it is not compatible with cars that have immobilizers.
B001CUNFGI|5|Amazing shipping. Super cold too!
B003RX0ZQG|5|Fine, needed the price is right too
B00EP2LKEO|5|I got it a few days early. It fits nicely. It's super light. I can't say anything bad about it. But keep in mind. You might have to paint top part of radiator flat black with high temp paint. Other wise you will see the silver on the radiator clearly.
B00OSW9V0Q|5|These are excellent lights are a very nice price.
B005JRZPMM|5|This is a great sound deadner, buy it and you won't be disappointed. I used the high dollar brand and I used Reckhorn, I wish I had learned of Reckhorn before I purchased high $$ brand. Reckhorn clearly out performs the more expensive brand..
B000JZI21U|5|easy to install and works as it should, oring was included with the water pump
B00QLWTZ0W|4|Awesome!  Looks great in my 2010 4runner trail.  It took several hours to install due to my being a little anal, but the end result was worth it.<br /><br />More info on my install can be had here:<br />http://www.toyota-4runner.org/5th-gen-t4rs/195438-xuji-leather-steering-wheel-cover-install-goodbye-plastic-steering-wheel-oem.html
B0093NADRK|5|perfect
B00JV0O22M|5|Perfect!
B001UC72UI|5|worked as intended
B00KEW4WE4|3|These splash guards are OK in appearance but not quite up to OEM standards.  One of the front ones and one of the back ones fit well using the original screw/pin holes.  In order to acheive a snug fit with the other two I had to forgo the existing screw/pin holes, drill new holes and screw them into the wheel well.  If you are real fussy get the genuine Ford ones.
B00080QHMM|5|I love this little tire gauge.  Lightweight and easy to use.  Readout is easy to read and gives PSI in .5 # increments.
B001NZM6QC|5|worked fine
B00FW1JRVK|5|Very easy to install and very bright, only thing is it didn't come with instructions but is a pretty simple job.
B00IFPAS9U|5|EXCELLENT PURCHASE
B00GOR5DDW|5|Excelente
B007CA7DXS|5|awesome!!!
B004GEOMI2|5|Exact fit.  Just had to undo the three screws from top, and had to go behind the grille to undo the three plastic tabs from the bottom.  New grille looks much better than the old one, which just had cosmetic issues, but still looked bad enough to me to make me replace it.
B000C944R4|4|Good but not great. A year later, seems to make some slight noise from time to time.
B007V2BQOY|5|Way better than the cheaper sun shades. Excellent in 100 degree weather
B00HVHMW9C|5|Fit perfectly no problems
B009DJQO5E|4|A little flimsy but great for the price
B006XWNTSY|5|perfect
B00EVQI862|5|Great kit
B00O5UFNEO|3|It was a little short in the back
B00J52R3LS|5|Works much better than expected.  Good picture and sound and easy set up.  Face it to the south, plug it in and follow directions on screen; That is all there is to it.  We purchased Dish RV so we can turn it on and off.  Expensive but should be less expensive over time.
B00H2VVL0S|5|Very good product, I painted my cars rust this spring and its still black and not getting worse. But it does not stick to anything else. Everywhere that I painted that was not rusty it just came off in a stiff sheet. Only put it on the rusty metal anywhere is a waste. AND- don't get it on your hands, It will come off if you get to it when its wet but if it drys on your hands they will be black for a week or better. This I know, I got hurrying, its a very thin paint and goes a look way, it dont store well so I slapped it on everywhere including all over my hands<br /><br />One thing.. Don't waste the paint putting it on anything that is not rusty. With in 2 months all the Por-15 came off every spot that we used it on that was not rusty. It came off in large black thin sheets.
B00C5T9PCS|5|Perfect replacement.... we got this so we could have one stand that holds a shade umbrella (drilled hole in the table) and then use this one when we want to switch back to just the table.  Perfect fit.
B00B58321A|1|I purchased this pump to replace my original pump for 181K miles.  My old pump was showing high utilization numbers on vagcom ( 70% at idle).  The pump that came in was slightly different in design than my original one, however fit perfect.  One small note, the float arm plastic piece where the arm attaches to the fuel pump body is a small fragile clip (should improve that design).  I helped mine with a small wire twisted around both the arm and the retaining clip.  The install is pretty straight forward..just disconnect the old one and drop in the new one.  After install vagcom displayed between 48-51% utilization at idle which was really good numbers.  The pump has been working great for three weeks now but now it's having issues.  The is now cutting off when I'm at highway speeds as if it's overheating and shutting off (preventing possible damage/fire to the car) which causes the car to stall.  Very crappy when driving down the highway during traffic hours after work.  Just pull over and wait a minute then restart the car and the problem goes away.  A replacement part is on the way compliments of Amazon but I hope the new part doesn't have the same issue.  I've been using Beck Arnley parts since my BMW days and they have always been a good OEM replacement parts supplier but now that I'm on VW platform, parts dependability might be different.  I'll update review once the new pump arrives and gets installed.
B005CDNCQO|5|Perfect......2004 Toyota Highlander base 3.3L AWD
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Good investment for your bike. You never know when this little gadget will come in handy. Can't beat it for the price!
B001O0U1OU|5|Perfect Fit, 2001 Civic.
B00P3AT0BM|5|Holds the cable for my dash cam securely and stays stuck to windshield.
B0002L6SRQ|5|First time finding the right size for the jeep.
B00KV8U254|1|I installed both of these bulbs at the same time while wearing latex gloves to protect the bulbs. One of the bulbs burned out the very next day. These bulbs were cheap and now I know why. You have been warned.
B0065LTR98|5|Great tool for carbon fiber vinyl installation
B000TDQG8S|5|Sturdy and well built
B007YS5KVK|5|Makes dropping kids off at school a breeze.  Five year old can now latch & unlatch seatbelt himself around his car seat with this device. I was hesitant at first due to price - so glad I finally went ahead and got.
B000VZF720|5|Easy to mount and the view it provides is excellent.
B000E4TWRY|4|A minor defect in the manual mirror control joystick let the two halves of the body separate but i was able to fix it myself with a hammer and a punch.<br /><br />Kudos to the seller for a quick turn-around on a replacement after the delivery service left it on  the front porch to be stolen without even ringing the doorbell.
B006H34AE6|5|Does a great job for removing dog hair off furniture - and at a much lower price than one I bought just like it for much more from a home products &#34;party&#34;.
B0051ZJ0NC|3|Paint match is pretty solid. But the clear coat takes a full week to cure before it can be wet sanded smooth.
B003BZLL40|4|Did the job.
B000RZPNOQ|4|works so so
B000NJ39E2|5|Our awning strap broke and we got this one.  It's the correct size and works fine.
B000C3XD9K|5|1st off, a HUGE kudos to: By Rust Never Sleeps on September 9, 2012  This review is invaluable, please heed his advise. As for my 2 cents?  My main reason for loving this oil filter is:  The  &#34;1 inch nut&#34; on the end of the cap makes changing my oil filter a non-hassle event.
B004TB16M2|5|Great price and works great!
B00BQS6UA4|5|EXCELLENT
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Muy bien
B001FXSR1A|2|pretty much just a cheap old sticker
B00P1ZPAU4|5|Grate sticker
B0090SICFS|3|Looks good on the car just don't like how it points out in the middle farther then the hood and we had to cut the bottom piece to fit it was to long
B00LXHHSK4|5|I love everything I has order from you  Thank you!
B000E4D5QI|4|Great item at a great price!  I gave it four stars because it took longer than expected to receive.
B0028OA9KM|5|Works great
B00WYSBTS8|5|Looks better than the chrome one
B00FLFZH3O|4|I am very glad I purchased this, especially at the price!
B00192KYFO|5|Best upgrade you can do for your rv. .  Very happy with this purchase.
B0041QS664|5|Fits the Icon Alliance helmet perfectly.
B0081ST4V4|5|These do work.  Its a little bit tricky getting the pins engaged properly, but there is no way to remove the stereo without this tool.
B009DJQG5M|5|i now have dashlights!!! thanks!
B0002SR4PY|2|I tried to use it. The spring kept popping off. It is way too weak. When you open the jaws to fit a bigger sized filter the spring simply comes off.<br /><br />I gave up and tried a different kind of wrench (which worked).<br /><br />I might try to find a better spring but for now, this thing is of no use to me as received.  I really can not use it like it is.<br /><br />Looking at other reviews, the spring seems to be a common problem. I wonder why they don't fix it?
B00BLI06JK|5|Nice light very bright works well also looks good
B000FUKQ86|4|So far looks good.  Will see in 3-4 months how the color holds up.
B00FLFIKEM|5|Phenomenal item. Here in the south the sun will roast you out even with windows up and AC on blast. Checked into having my clear top tinted / laminated with no luck. This top is EXACTLY what you need!
B00RWWZ7P2|5|It's all good
B00HK4WKIY|4|Have no knuckle protection or protection for street riding, but are comfortable for BMX or MX riding.<br /><br />Basically just a glove to cover your hands and protect from blisters. Very comfortable gloves, nice fit, and nice quality!
B008DNC7KW|5|Perfect! Just what I wanted
B008RAPM7G|1|I am not impressed!  I received this today and was disappointed to find there was no switch, dial, indicator, nuthin. If the sellers would at least put some instructions on Amazon explaining HOW this thing worked, I wouldn't have to return it and delay my project. So allow me to let folks know how it is expected to work... It says it has 12 settings. When things are hooked up there is a wire that changes flash settings every time that wire touches ground. I guess the best way would be to use a spring toggle switch. What I don't like about it is you have to toggle through all 12 positions in order to use the flash you want. I need one to use on an aircraft, so I certainly wont know which setting it is on.
B00T36QTG6|5|The part of the center pull that goes into the awning, was a tad small- pulled out a couple of times. I put some duct tape around it and it solved the problem. Works good
B009T9O99G|5|This is the best gloss sealant I found to use that stands out. I bought a bottle for a cousin that he used on his BMW. And he's not complaining. Recommend
B000CN9AN8|5|This is a great product. Fits perfectly. Durable. Easy to install.
B00A9RH3I6|3|Not bad...........I like the slick Ninja pad much better for looks however.
B003S1RQ2S|5|Have been using it for years for my house alarm. It has not failed.
B00C5MXJ7M|5|Put this in my small sprinter based motorhome.  Works great!<br />Small size a big plus.<br />Telescope inlet pipe a plus.<br />Even the small head upholstery brush works well.<br />Seems to bag most of the dust, I've seen no problem with dust in the cabinet where I mounted it.<br />No more big unwieldy vacs to store and lug around.
B00G620ZVU|4|GOOD PACKAGED DEAL
B005G6J3EM|1|Good price but Horrible sticker. It comes in separate peices. I thought it was going to be easy just peel and stick but no you have to figure out where each part goes. I gave up and just threw it away such a waste of time.
B002MW6HRO|5|Works very well
B00480N0E6|3|does the job
B00G9AIBMO|4|Way better than buying the aftermarket wiper and arm. Would give it 5 stars if there were instructions, but Youtube solves all.  Once i figured it out it was a piece of cake. Will OEM inserts from now on.  Good deal.
B00PH99P3C|5|Im soo happy with this product, car is running like a CHAMP again after replacing intake with the new one. My husband is wanting more and more car products from this site. So excited and greatful for the price and great value of the items already purchased... will definitely keep buying...
B002BELP3Y|5|I was pleasantly surprised on how good this actually worked. I feel like ive been wasting time using towels in the past. Its not perfect and a shammy is still needed for detail drying but this sure makes it faster to dry your car before you have waters spots. Also worked great on windows for your house
B00SAVDQVG|5|👍
B00O7CR17C|5|perfect accessory for any r-line owner and has a very oem look
B00FPNRSPC|5|good price and is the same stuff as at the high dollar marinas.
B001DRLPJE|5|Fits Jetta Mk5 just fine.
B00NV8R63C|4|As expected. Hard to get insulated on side by side had to cut one side off
B00PT18QAQ|5|I purchased this gauge several months ago and have used it regularly.  I am very satisfied with this gauge and recommend it to anyone considering this type of product.
B003IS3HV0|5|It's not the cure for cancer, but this product works great and I highly recommend it.  Buy it !
B005VPS13M|5|Easy installation and perfect fit. I saved $200 by do it by myself.
B001N0E16A|5|Perfect
B00P32EQKU|4|easy to apply.
B002WI97FM|5|I like the bike chain design and it has a high quality chrome surface.
B00YI3IGA6|5|I was offered this product at a reduced rate. This product is amazing I've bought other shades for my car and they do not cover like this one does. This one fully covers the whole window and leaves no gaps present  to come through so my son is protected from the rays 100% . I would truly recommend this if your a new mom for you kids
B00V5B3PRS|2|The shipping time was reasonable considering the item was sent from overseas, the quality was good and the adhesive backing was also of good quality.  The problem is the color and finish do not match the interior trim of the BMW Sport Line in Coral Red Matte finish.  The red color is a shade lighter and the finish is glossy,not dull.  Even though the item is of good quality, when you see it in the car, it looks like an after market add-on and not original.
B00480BWCI|1|First time out the blocks were used to level a truck camper.  The blocks were stacked 2 high as recommended and were promptly collapsed by the jackstand.  The front tires were set to back up over a setup of two blocks on the ground and one above joining the two below.  One of them no longer fits inside the others as it took on a new shape after trying to hold up one tire of an F350.  Buyer beware and read the reviews.  I will from now on.
B0096B9V22|5|Came in perfect condition. Installed easily and has been working flawlessly. Great product.
B00P2RPJ8Y|5|Fixed my sloppy shifter! !
B007HD5FF8|5|Perfect fit for my 2006 MX-5. I'm sure that these are factory original.
B00D7ZAYI8|5|Seriously so simple. I can't believe I was going to spend so much from the dealership. I am so glad to know I can do not myself.
B0049PI5W2|1|Worked perfectly for about 10 minutes then locked up and started to melt the plastic would not buy again but It did fit my 2006 Subaru impreza a.c. compressor clutch
B007KOO262|5|Excellent quality.
B003S1RQ2S|5|Product arrived much faster than I expected. Easy to install. As far as I can tell, it works just fine. The only issue was the lack of an alarm manual to know how to place system in Test mode. The alarm helpdesk helped me there. Swapped batteries in seconds after that. Piece of cake.
B00802GIW4|5|Great plug and play lights on the truck a week and still blinding.
B00HDE3G52|5|I installed 2 on my audi s4 twin turbo and I think that they are worth it, I noticed they made like a whining sound in second gear just over 3000 rpms. I recommend if u want to upgrade from oem, KraftWerk look bigger and better
B00I6U5DFS|5|Very nice looks great on my Harley fits nice
B00CZAMWB8|4|I put these in a 2012 Ram 1500 ST. They are pretty easy to put on if you follow the instructions. They look good and are waterproof. They add some cushioning back support. The only thing I don't like is that they seem to make my back and legs sweat.
B001UJH13O|5|Perfect size stickers
B000CPCBEG|4|ok
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|I ride a Klr all over Kyrgyzstan. Stay in the mountains for days. This thing will keep my phone and many other thing charged for days. Plus, if it gets real cold and the bike won't start, no problem.
B001D228G8|3|Item does not fit 97 Lexus LS 400 will fit in tray but not back in slot for filter
B00FPTMLLM|5|I used this product last weekend on my car seat.  I am happy with the quality of the product.
B00GUD05J2|5|Perfect easy fit!
B000EDUTN6|5|This one is all metal. So I hope I don't have to ever replace this thing again! Works for the water heater.
B001TLC12E|2|I didn't relive the back seats where 2 separate pieces. They did not fit and Amazon said it was a match.
B00KDRXDEU|5|very pretty on my car
B00HAOYFJ6|4|Works as good as original.
B00DS6L746|3|I had this installed on my 2007 Toyota Prius<br /><br />Pros<br />+ Feels good to the touch<br />+ The leather looks great (except see below)<br />+ Hugs the steering wheel tight and 'feels' like part of the original steering wheel<br /><br />Cons<br />- time consuming to install (but worth the effort). It took me 3 hours to do the baseball stitch method.<br />- This cover is not fitted for a specific diameter and thickness of steering wheel. It is a rectangular piece of leather that is stitched at both ends to form a circle. The out ends of the cover which ends up on the inside edge of the wheel, needs to cover less diameter than the middle of the belt which runs along the outermost side of the steering wheel. This causes excess material to build up as one goes stitching the cover to the wheel. The only solution I could think off was to spread this excess material around the spokes and then pull it tight to give a pleated look - the alternative would be to leave it loose like a flap (which i think would have been uglier).<br /><br />For the price, I think the quality and finish is good. However considering I spent 3 hours installing this, a more expensive custom fit cover may have been a better option.
B00ODILBZ8|4|Install is easy- Wish the white finish cover the cut around the border
B00AMEKV76|5|Sooiio bright! I love it for my motorcycle.. Well worth the money.
B00ELJMLGM|3|Well... it smells just fine and all, but I bought this to spray in my car to give it that nice scent of Drakkar and this stuff fades very quickly. If I spray it in the car in the evening, by the next morning the smell is totally gone already. I'll probably just buy the cologne itself to spray in my car. I sprayed this stuff really thick, too -- still nothing by the next morning. I was disappointed.
B00A8MZ7IA|5|Similar to Viking's satin-edged Detailing Towel (their item 945000) if you want to compare in a local store: =  Both are suitable for a final touch top paint wipe down for &#34;hey neighbor!&#34; or most &#34;roll and show&#34; competitions. +  These CG towels are plusher on the fluffy side with a denser nap (more loops? IDK the term), about the same on the smoother side. +  These CG towels have better stitching on the edge silk (as mentioned by another reviewer). +++ At this Amazon price point these are a no-brainer (even against CG's we-will-give-you-a-coupon-on-our-website price). -  I hate the tag, just like almost every other reviewer. Maybe there is some law or regulation somewhere that requires a tag on a towel (like there is for a mattress?). Carefully rip the tag out prior to use. ~  Slightly smaller at 16&#34; x 16&#34; than the Viking at 15.5&#34; x 23&#34; but it is no big deal. ~  There were a few - a few - stray strands of lint, a quick shake-and-pick and you're good to go. (You do it anyway, no matter how diligent you are in segregating your towels. And by &#34;you&#34; I mean &#34;I.)  After getting these to try out, I will put these towels on Amazon subscription.
B001KRYIC8|2|Perfect fit but doesn't do a great job.
B000FQ968Q|5|Worked great, fast shipping. thanks.
B008BB4HC2|5|I checked all my local resources  including HD and major motorcycle parts catalogs.  After searching the web I found this one.  Great price and quality is excellent.  Out preforms the higher priced Spike starter I replaced.
B004500M8G|1|these things don't work. when a head-gasket is gone its gone and cant be returned.
B007QG03SK|4|I suppose its as good as its gonna get. Roller ball tip spreads paint outside of thin scratches. Paint match isn't exact, but guess its as close as its going to get.
B00QJ8FA70|5|Excellent service, product and fast delivery! A+
B00F66QV5G|5|Oem cover fits perfectly.
B000ZB13IC|5|Great seat covers. Fit my Excursion's front seats like a glove. Great quality material, and made not to slip or roll off. My leather seats were falling apart after 15 years. I won't give up my Titan V10 engine. It's the only thing that can haul my boat around. Makes the interior look like new. Nice colors as well. They also make a multitude of auto cover products that are the best I have seen. I will buy more covers from this manufacturer.
B00IN6XBQ8|4|I am very satisfied with the end results.. however I was not happy with their instruction, the written instructions were vague so I watched the video and it did not show how to put these on my kawasaki concours. They used a small bike and that's when the fun began. First off they should have stated to take Venter stand off first. I did not so I had to remove my muffler to get one of the bolts out. Second was that they tell you not to adjust the links prior to installation because they are set at the same length. I recommend you put a Jack or lift under the bike to keep it at the current height before taking the old links off. I took the old links off and the bike dropped. I had to adjust soupys links all the way out to put them on. Then I worried that they were not the same length. I contacted soupy and they were prompt with there response saying to use a caliper to be sure each link was the same length. My links ended up  a tad over seven inches. Ever price calipers that measure that long? Forget about it. I used a tape measure. Just got back on a 1003 mile ride and they are great. My feet reach the ground just right.  I recommend the product but think things through before you start taking things apart. Brian
B0018KO7KU|5|great item
B00T5U9GOW|5|Great looking sticker!  Good conversational gag for your car or bike!
B000BQP5DA|5|very pleased
B00BCRMAAS|4|worked good for front,ok on back,not so great on back.
B003174A14|5|Awesome. We put them through hell on our travels to south dakato from across the country and they held up great. Great purchase and a must have for motorcycle enthusiast.
B00HYFCESK|5|A very high quality product! Installed in a few minutes...rock solid and already in use on my jeep. OH, by the way; a great price too!
B003RVYL4A|5|Received in timely manner. Easy to program and works great.
B00CZG1ZRY|5|works great, very happy with purchase, highly recommend
B003TU662Y|1|Do not buy it. The brush was broken when I first used it.
B000VUR6CE|5|Excellent back-up
B00N6D885M|5|It was a perfect replacement for the fresh water flush out kit on my mercruiser engine.
B00OKSP3S2|5|Finished off the tail end of my new Corvette. Color is dead on couldn't be happier.
B00EB6YVFY|5|Awesome parts! They came in and I put them on a couple nights later no problems at all!
B000F6DNMQ|5|This is a great product!  My garage is just barely large enough for my Subaru, and with this mat, I can feel when I've driven into the exact right position so the garage door will close without hitting the rear of the car, and still leave me space to walk in front of the car to the entrance to the house.
B000ZAV7MA|4|Love the material!  It doesn't seem to stay taught in the seat, keeps loosening and sliding forward.  Maybe it is the way I tied it.
B003QVIYEE|3|Fits like original,  squeaks a little. Hope it is just breaking in.
B00X4RXP62|5|Looks great on my car.
B004I0E9YG|5|I'm very happy with product
B001HX89RA|5|Great product and shipping was quick!
B00MN82712|5|Awesome. Bigger and better than expected
B00FEL30R0|5|I had rust spots all over my truck.  i brought it to the dealership and they said there was little to do with it except going to a professional detailer or using a clay bar (10+ hrs on a big truck).  A friend suggested Iron X and it worked perfectly!  It took about 30 minutes to completely rid my truck of rust spots.  There is a smell that rinsing alone will not take off (bring it through a carwash) but it is a little issue compared to what it does.  Highly recommended!
B009ELI8IM|2|Fit properly and attached easily but faded quickly. Now appears copper rather than black.
B000VU5IZG|4|awesome for those that like their wiring to be super neat. I would suggest it came with a color coded pig tail possibly.
B00OTE4FLI|5|Easy to replace, part fits as OEM
B001QYSXAS|2|Ease of install, sleek look, much better appearance then the stock antenna, but I get horrible reception, and it's mounted on the roof .
B000M8IF1Q|5|works good
B01092IEEM|3|HARD to install on RAV4 2015, just don't fit very well,, will have to do many modifications to get them to work...
B00B3L2DQO|5|Came a few days early and was best deal I could find.
B001DRHMRI|5|This is the oil filter required for my vehicle and I was happy to find it at a reasonable price. I trust Mann quality as I've used their products in the past. My oil filter is imprinted on the end with &#34;Made in Germany&#34;, so apparently they haven't outsourced all their manufacturing.
B00L2NPNZQ|5|Fits G35x 2005.
B00GHT9G6W|5|Perfect replacement.
B000EQC0XK|5|It was shipped quickly and very happy with the item.
B001LQMEY2|5|Replaced my original in minutes! I have a Volant CAI and my original was giving me a &#34;flat spot&#34; at take off. The dealer said it was the CAI , to make a long story short ... Installed this in 15 minutes and my Avalanche is like a roaring beast now! I printed out instructions from another review in case I need to reprogram it but there was no need. I highly recommend this over paying 3-4 times the amount at the dealer for the &#34;exact&#34; same part (it even has GM stamp and part# on it)<br />****Make sure you get the gasket*****
B00H6XPZN6|5|I love it! I have a light skin tone and you would not want to expose your skin in the sun specially on a long drive. You would hate an uneven skin tone but with this sun shade, it keeps me cool and at the same time worry less for my skin to be tanned. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
B00KJ0DUP8|5|not a bad set of mirrors fit nice on my 04 f150. i will say they do have a very minute amount of vibration not enough to be a bother.on the 04 f150 the are almost plug and play. but you do have to move a ground wire to a different position in the plug.the turn signals work but not the puddle lights. i think an additional wire is needed for those.
B0012Q3XR8|4|Its a Gladhand and it does what its supposed to do.  Although clearly made in china, its still holding up well.  Buying this on Amazon may not be the cheapest way but with the free and expedited shipping (Prime), it was a decision maker.
B008XLPP9E|5|worked better than expected, took out ALL scratches even deep ones.
B00180JAWK|1|junk
B000IYU4AY|5|Keep It original with AC Delco
B00BFWM65E|5|One of the best deals out there! (&#60; $80)  I, absolutely, LOVE this jacket.  I'm 5'5&#34; and at 150 lbs I wear a 40D...so the 3X fits nicely-with room for bulkier tops, but still a great fit with a T-shirt, too!  Very high quality leather and the armor pads are both a nice touch and removable.  Would recommend this jacket to any & all lady-riders.  Don't let the huge sizing (3X) scare you off.  Check out the river road site for their chart sizing and don't worry about ordering a size or two larger.
B00PH97FQG|3|Pretty good product.Not impressed with the quality.
B002UC2XD8|5|So far so good. Easy install.
B000CLUESA|5|It was hard to determine that this was the right filter for my car, but once I was sure....no problem.
B002FYBLX4|5|Fast delivery, perfect fit.
B00EHYN5E8|5|Value for money
B00MOZXYKM|5|Great product!
B00ASEELTY|4|This was a gift and the person I gave it too loved it.
B004HYNGHY|5|Fits perfect on my 06 mega cab!! Cheeee Pono!!
B004ZG65S6|3|Very Nice item and good price to boot and does help
B00GHT0VDY|5|Very good for the use
B0002SQYTG|5|Great gauge, doesn't stick.
B00CEXK6S2|5|very nice fit, love it
B000COX4UM|5|Used these in my 2005 Yamaha V-Star 1100 Classic<br />Works great
B00092893E|4|Best fuel system cleaner.
B000UHD74E|5|The smell is not that strong. It took away the musty, sweaty smell immediately.
B007SCKGT8|3|It's an after market part and you can tell by the thinness of the liner. Its of a lighter thickness than the original. My original got ripped off by snow and ice build up living in Colorado and once I added the new one, a missing clip led the liner to rest on the tire while driving allowing the friction to rub a new giant hole in the liner. Had to replace it again with same part. After 6 months it seems to be holding up after some crafty workmanship to secure it.
B001LHVOVK|5|Worked like a charm on my '06 Nissan Frontier SE (6 Cyl).  Manual issues others mentioned may have been cleared up, I can't say the English is absolutely perfect, but it is completely understandable and issues are minor at best.  Worked exactly as expected!
B005VHN8JC|1|Does not fit ram 1500
B00USC2CEW|5|Looks great, but have yet found time to get it installed.
B00NY1D8RE|5|They aren't easy to get on but look fantastic and fit better than what we had before.  Great deal for the price!
B00AZZG8HO|5|Item arrived as expected.
B0089DZZ2I|5|No more squeaking breaks on the Baja warrior mini bike.
B000CMF38A|1|any way I hooked it up it did'nt work  not worth buying
B0023VINGM|5|Nice quality.  I went to YouTube for detailed instructions for installation.  Installation requires a little bit of skill.  I did two lights in about two hours.  Much better quality than a headlight re-polish kit.  It came with headlight bulbs installed too!
B006AFAWYI|5|Best results yet...from anything I've tried as far as getting a glossy shine.....my RV is 11 years old and it did a fabulous job.
B000BGK22E|4|It works just as good as the new one
B001O0C4TA|5|Great trailer hitch. Works well.
B00KDDAR66|4|The switch works beautifully for my son, he wanted a flush top button and he really likes this one.  thank you
B000BYM4VS|5|It's a gauge. Works as described.
B0006SU3QW|5|Awesome product. But indid find it at Walmart for 5.00$ a can
B000CO86EG|5|For the price you can't complain about anything.  Retraction of ram slow and needs help when no weight on it, but again, for the money, I'd buy again without hesitation.
B004EG9I5Y|5|These fit perfect on my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500, but I did some modifications to these such as replacing the white Halos with Red Halos and also using HID fog lights, but it all works perfectly and the installation was extremely simple. Even has the words &#34;Top&#34; on each one incase you cant tell which one is for the right or left side.
B00CP7V9IS|2|It looks good, but did not help reduce air flow when drving. Price little higher than other competitors.
B0061QK7E6|4|Good Quality and exactly as described and will no doubt place another order.  I do recommend!
B000IG5J5C|2|Bought these for a car I rarely drive last June 2014 and they have already worn out in the seat area and where the shoulder belt rubs a little on them. Would not buy again.
B000EH4UXM|5|works great
B00IAEW3LC|5|I tried 2 other bungs for my oil pan and both of those were a pain to weld and I ended up cutting them out. This bung is way better due to it being longer and slightly thicker than most of the other ones on Amazon. Worked great for my oil dip stick.
B00U50RNBO|5|Awesome grill! No problem with fit or install on my 2015 Jeep Wrangler. I used my OEM clips instead of the supplied ones. They seemed a bit more heavy duty, my preference. You can find everything to help you with this install on the web. I got this done while my husband went out to the store. Easy Stuff!
B008G22REQ|5|Shipped fast..perfect fit, flawless product..better quality than some of the more expensive options..fast and easy installation..
B00RURSUBC|5|Nice bar, well worth the money!
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Lights up the deck very well
B00F5MUB66|3|Seems pretty good. But like a lot have complained, there can be a good bit of wasted water use because it will not shut off completely.
B00KTHWXYU|5|easy to program & does the job,
B00WPIEZ9C|1|No comment
B000DELUC0|5|Works perfectly. No installation issues at all. Air is cold again!
B0006HP9I0|4|well made and works well for me with the MDS ignition system…94 Dodge Ram 2500

B00WPI1NR4|1|No comment
B000P5JO5M|1|Waste of money. No more powerful than the miniature mobility kit that came in my trunk.
B0097X6730|3|Have not slept on it yet, but think I will be satisfied. The cover did NOT come with it and I have been calling for almost a month and the recording promises a prompt reply. So far NOTHING. Really don't expect to get without contacting a lawyer, But I'm good with that. Lawyer is a personal friend.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Does the job. Easy to fold and put away.
B000NTE6LW|5|This part takes a little figuring out to remove the original one and install the replacement but afterwards the fuel door works as good as new. It's definitely worth the extra time and effort!
B000HUCMKE|5|Let's be honest...its a gasket.  Either it will work, or it won't.<br /><br />This one was a perfect fit for my 2009 Ford Escape, and it came quickly in the mail.<br /><br />The Amazon price was right in range with what it would cost after shipping from any other national source, and none of my local parts stores had this one in stock.<br /><br />Fel-Pro is a recognized brand, and I'm not disappointed in this gasket.
B000CKSXVQ|5|Spectra premium condencer fit very nicely, better than origional. Works very well on my 1991 f-150.
B0012ETJ1O|5|Amazing upgrade for my 02 Road Glide.  Everyone noticed the change immediately and bought em too
B002MQOXGW|5|Great to check tire pressure on my Harley.
B000XEBI9K|5|I had purchase this same bumper bully years ago. It works perfectly fine no more nightmares of nicks and scrapes on my bumper.
B009REM198|2|Too big!. Way bigger than the picture
B00EIKBJYY|5|excelente
B00VXYN9R8|4|Awesome, look badass on my 650!
B005CLMYOW|5|this part was easy to install and works great. looks just like the stock part-is made of the same heavy duty plastic.
B007P72W4I|5|Awesome
B00T64VGUO|5|These new phillips headlight are truely the best headlights for the money. The daytime running lights look amazing and the high beams have a great tight beam of light that projects extremely far. Very happy with this purchase!
B000GVEQOO|5|Excellent product works like a champ
B008D7PHGE|5|Worked great, and very easy to install!!
B003X9YTP2|5|Worked excellent for my 2013 Toyota vienza hybrid
B002P8IK0C|4|Maybe not as sturdy as my OEM. But the angle of view and perspective is much better. I'm considering buying another to replace my other mirror that wasn't broken.
B000FQ7NV8|5|Look great on my green and black Jeep
B00E9DXRV8|5|Although I don't have a lot of experience with other off-road helmets, I am very satisfied with the Fox V1.  Fits snug, but not uncomfortable.  Seems to have good airflow.  I like the fact that the interior lining is completely removable.  Mine had some very small defects in the surface finish, but they are not noticable more than about 1 foot away.  Plus I'm putting my own scratches into 4-wheeling through the woods.  Worth noting that we own six helmets in our family, all of which are Fox.  I'm a firm believer that when you find something that works well, don't take a risk in changing.  And, with the variety of designs available you will find something that looks good.
B002ZW8RVU|5|Good
B00K9553GW|5|Worked perfect
B00HDKFQS6|5|Really heavy duty & an absolute necessity  for any of the GO POWER! portable folding suitcase solar panels.  Very 1st-class connectors that mate with the rest of neat connectors  that you'll find in the three portable models  that GO POWER ! offers.
B000765E0S|2|This was very easy to mount on my 87 Toyota pickup. My only complaint was that it was missing 2 of the bolts that were supposed to go with it. I attempted to contact the seller and Amazon both and my only option was to have Amazon ship me a whole new unit and send the old one back which was kind of ridiculous since I would have to lug a 60+ pound box to work with me (I park in a parking garage and walk 1/2 mile) just to get 2 bolts. In the end I purchased the bolts myself (which was a very hard to do, not many places locally carry grade 8).<br /><br />Other than that, it's a great receiver. It bolted up perfectly with no drilling required at all.
B00D9C2CDO|1|Has an awful, toxic chemical odor!!! Yuck! Sending it back.
B00PE5M91E|5|Heavy duty, high quality frame with excellent lettering and graphics.
B00JHEG7UC|4|For 30 bucks you cant complain
B00DTNGVLM|5|My hubby loved it!!
B00KY0A2MC|4|what can I say?  if an alternator fits the car and works then that's all there is to be said.  So... the alternator fits and seems to work, the battery light in the car has gone off and I guess the car is now alright.
B0024NM37E|5|Shipped on time and securely. Installed easily and work great!
B005NELVOM|5|The lights look really cool at night I really loved them.
B00317FZM2|3|Does not have the diamond pattern but instead is smooth and clear so you will definitely see the bulb you're using. Mine would fog up after it rained or a car wash. I ended up getting the JDM ones, way better.
B000YC5IG0|5|Fit jus perfect on my compressor... Back to blowing my horn an up setting ppl who's around!! Blow ur horn... not ur temper... Cheeee Pono!!
B008G6ZQOU|5|Just as pictured, good quality as well.
B004QHCDBC|5|Good product,  thank you
B003U1Q47E|5|fit & matched nice.
B00VYX2I7A|5|Fast respond. Good dealing
B00EECM5FI|5|worked perfectly
B00AFH278G|5|Does the job. Use these on my equipment.
B0031OX4P0|5|Better quality than the factory part.
B00XOTJ5DM|5|The product did work, except it still was stacte on the dust. I had to keep wiping the plastic windshield, every half mile or so.
B00PV7K0FC|5|Perfect single smoker cigar ashtray.
B00032K32A|3|It frames the plate - on the top.  Was looking for one that surrounds the plate but didn't read feedback.  It is an overlay and the plate sticks out a hair all around (see pic).  Will look for a different one.  Also - this one had a slight inward bow on top and bottom.  Was so cheap that it is not worth returning.  The metal though, is quality and solid (despite the bow).  Will be interesting to see how the chrome cover holds up until I can find a new one.
B008O5XKNW|5|Fantastic looking key chain, worth the price. Now everyone knows you own a BRZ!
B00F5MU9MW|4|One issue on installation. I tried using the tape application to hang unit in shower stall as opposed to screws. Tape won't hold.
B00C9OEZK6|2|really was not the right fit for me
B00UMQ5P8O|1|There were absolutely no intructions and it doesn't fit!!  There is no way to attached the gas cap to the actual Jeep without drilling a hole into the Jeep.  JUNK!
B004MDEV38|5|Very solid construction. Took a while to install. Because of the welding on the car, could not position this properly. I had to grind the hitch 2 mm on each side to do a proper fit. Not a big deal if you have the tools (used pneumatic angle grinder). Would buy it again.
B0091XUAY8|5|Best light for the $$
B00I5FTUDU|5|Love these switches.  I have 5 of these in my truck for light bar.  Rear lights.  Train horn.  And compressor.  Out of all of them. Only one has a loose connection. And the top part doesn't fully light up on the rocker hand switch emblem.  I just gonna  reorder that Switch .  All in all. They light up great.  Have a great click to them.  I also order the plastic housing that they sit in for a more secure and better look.  Very very happy with them
B004SX5HJO|5|Good lights, probably light duty because of small wires, but works great.
B003JH2M6G|5|Like them..fit perfectly
