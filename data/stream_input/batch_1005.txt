B0022UDMSS|5.0|I love this album and for first time I had an experience listening to Johnny Cash by Vinyl. I thought now I`m in San Quentin as audience of him !
B0032JTV6U|1.0|I am livid that there is no season 1 volume 2 to go with my season 1 volume 1 which I thought was the entire first season. It is bad enough that I have to buy all the cds separately and then pay $1.29 for all the songs they do not include on them, but now I have to pay an additional $40 to get the rest of the first season? It it rather ridiculous and they should really make a volume 2 dvd.
030726999X|5.0|The first thing an author must do to keep my attention is to create characters I care about. Generally, I will allow about 20 pages for that.<br />Next, those characters must be doing something that I find interesting. I allow another 15 or so pages for that.<br />Third, the characters and the plot must move, and do so with gusto.<br />Finally, the book or series must conclude in a normal manner with no artifice or contrivances.<br /><br />Larsson accomplishes all four and throws in an additional bonus by having the main character of the book not be the main focus of the book. No mean trick, that, by any author.<br /><br />I ever so glad the trilogy was finished, nonetheless saddened that there is no more to be had from this most gifted writer.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|I have a Panasonic DMP-BD10A Blue-Ray player, and this disk won't play on it, even after updating the player firmware to the latest revision (v2.5 as of 5/30/10).  To be accurate, after I jumped through the hoops to update the firmware on my player, I could get it to play if I hit one of the menu buttons while it was initially trying to read the disk and I could get to a menu, and, then I could get it to play until about 30 minutes in, when it started pixelating, super-imposing the chapter search screen on top of the video, then finally completely locking up the player.    Since encountering this, I did some minor research on the issue (do a search on your player model and \\"avatar\\" to see if it will play on yours), and the discussion seems to center on how Fox got stupid and released the BlueRay DVD with some extremely stupid DRM (anti-piracy) code on it without sufficiently testing it, since it basically won't play on a significant number of BlueRay players out there (including some very high-end players).    I won't be buying any further Fox BlueRay disks until/unless I hear they have removed such incompatible DRM - I'm not purchasing a new BlueRay player because the studio is so stupid.  I'm keeping this disk set since the regular DVD works fine, and Amazon's price is sufficiently low enough to make it worthwhile.
0385335997|5.0|I loved this book.  This is actually the third one, of a so far eight part series, telling the story of Claire and Jamie.  Some time ago I started with Drums of Autumn, then ran across A Breath of Snow and Ashes and realized that I wanted to start at the begining.  So I ordered all the books that I have not read.  I am so glad I did.  This is a marvelous story with a lot of history thrown in the mix.  I have become very fond of the leading characters who are very human.  Amazon has it listed under Romance novels, but I don't think that is a good place for the series.  I think more folks would read the books if they were under Historical Fiction.
B000001Y2U|5.0|Marilyn Manson has been a staple of my music collection since 1994, with the release of their first album, \\"Portrait Of an American Family\\".  That album featured a campy-horror sound to it, which was completely reinvented with the release of this album, \\"Antichrist Superstar\\".  \\"ACS\\" is the complete culmination of Manson as a rock star.  The album's sound has an industrial metal feel to it, yet the band (along with Trent Reznor's production) has written such a variety of sounds on this album that it's difficult to categorize. Naturally the album is chock-full of anti-religious and anti-establishment sentiment. I've never heard an album that is so lyrically and musically mesmerizing, especially while in an angry state.  \\"ACS\\" invokes a wide range of emotions from the listener, regardless of whether you love or hate Manson, the man or the band. For me, the album makes me feel a great rush when I'm down or upset, yet it is plenty satisfying in any other state.<br /><br />This is hands down the best (and heaviest) Manson album. This album is so good that it's hard to pick my favorite tracks from it. So I'll discuss each song.<br /><br />1.) \\"Irresponsible Hate Anthem\\" - The album was released near the end of 1996, and the liner notes read, \\"Irresponsible Hate Anthem was recorded live on February 14, 1997.\\"  Nice way to get a listener's attention.  The track actually sounds like a live track (sort of).  This song is very heavy and distorted, and has become a staple of Manson's collection of songs. Favorite lyric: \\"Everybody's someone else's n**ger / I know you are, so am I / I wasn't born with enough middle fingers / I don't need to choose a side.\\"<br /><br />2.) \\"The Beautiful People\\" - Breakthrough single from the album, helped launch this album to success.  Another Manson staple, very recognizable.  Favorite lyric: \\"There's no time to discriminate / Hate every motherf**ker that's in your way.\\"<br /><br />3.) \\"Dried Up, Tied and Dead To the World\\" - Manson himself describes this song as one of his favorites from the album (along with \\"Kinderfeld\\"). This track has a more industrial sound with electronic drums and has an atmospherically dark sound to it. Really cool track.  Favorite lyric:  \\"You shove your hair down my throat / I feel your fingers in me / Tear this bitter fruit to mess / Wrap it in your soiled dress / Now you must spit out the seeds.\\"<br /><br />4.) \\"Tourniquet\\" - This song has a slower, almost ballad-like feel to it.  Another single released from this album with a really cool video.  Favorite lyric: \\"I wrapped our loving in all this foil / Silver-tight like spider legs / I never wanted it to ever spoil / But flies will lay their eggs.\\"<br /><br />5.) \\"Little Horn\\" - Awesome track, really heavy and abrasive.  Little horn is mentioned in the bible, and the little horn is often believed to be or referred to as the Antichrist. One of the most killer tracks Manson has ever done. Favorite lyric:  \\"Dead will dance for what is left / Worms will wait with baited breath / Your blind have now become my deaf / So says the little horn\\".<br /><br />6.) \\"Cryptorchid\\" - A song that stands alone on the album.  Industrial drums with incredibly eerie music and vocals.  Not heavy at all.  Really original track here. Favorite lyric:  \\"Each time I make my mother cry / An angel dies and falls from Heaven.\\"<br /><br />7.) \\"Deformography\\" - Another industrial sounding song, with keyboards and electronic drums dominating the track. This track grows on the listener and turns out to be one of the more original sounding tracks on the album.  Favorite lyric: \\"I lift you up like the sweetest angel / I tear you down like a whore / I will bury your god in my warm spit / You'll be deformed in your porn.\\"<br /><br />8.) \\"Wormboy\\" - Pretty hard to describe this song. Another track that stands alone on the album with it's upbeat tempo and in-your-face lyrics.  Another track that may need some time to grow on the listener, but I love it. Favorite lyric: \\"The world shudders as the worm gets his wings\\".<br /><br />9.) \\"Mister Superstar\\" - A really rockin' song, and pretty much sums up the idea that people are hopelessly devoted to rock stars in every way (kinda like myself, hehe). Favorite lyric:  \\"Hey Mr. Superstar / I'll kill myself for you / Hey Mr. Superstar / I'll kill you if I can't have you.\\"<br /><br />10.) \\"Angel With the Scabbed Wings\\" - Another hard rocker.  Manson opened with this song many times on the \\"Dead to the World\\" tour. Intense song. Very cool. Favorite lyric: \\"Mommy's got a scarecrow / Gotta let the corn grow / Man can't always reap what he sow.\\"<br /><br />11.) \\"Kinderfeld\\" - As stated earlier, this song was identified by Manson as one of his favorites from the album.  The song is the spookiest song in Manson's entire catalog, with a very slow gothic feel to the music and lyrics. Manson sounds like an evil witch on this track.  One of my favorites from any of this bands' albums.  Favorite lyric: \\"The toys all smell like children / and the scab-kness will obey / I'll have to kneel on broomsticks / Just to make it go away.\\"<br /><br />12.) \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" - Another hard rocking song that is the most important song on the album is this title track.  It sums up the central ideas of the album's theme, the rise of the antichrist and the failure of society. One of my favorites from the album I would say. Favorite lyric: \\"Prick your finger, it is done / The moon has now eclipsed the Sun / The angel has spread his wings / The times have come for bitter things.\\" (This lyric also appears in \\"Cryptorchid\\")<br /><br />13.) \\"1996\\" - The most angry and aggressive song on the album with a really cool lyrical theme.  You feel the theme of the album is further driven home by this track.  Heavy and offensive. Just the way it should be on a Manson album.  Favorite lyric: \\"Anti-Satan and anti-black / The anti-world is on my back / Anti-gay and anti-dope / I am the fa**ot anti-pope.\\"<br /><br />14.) \\"Minute Of Decay\\" - A slow song, with the bass guitar leading the way most of the time.  Cool song, slow and creepy.  I guess if I had to pick some lesser favorite songs from the album this one would be up there on my list, although it's still a cool song. Favorite lyric: \\"The minute that it's born / It begins to die / I'd love to just give in / I'd love to live this lie.\\"<br /><br />15.) \\"The Reflecting God\\" - My favorite Manson song, period. From any album. This song is brutal and adrenaline pumping. One of the more anti-religious tracks the band has ever recorded, which is a bold statement.  This song totally kicks ass.  Favorite lyric:  \\"I went to God just to see / And I was looking at me / Saw heaven and hell were lies / When I'm God everyone dies.\\"<br /><br />16.) \\"Man That You Fear\\" - An acoustic track (believe it or not) serves as the album closer.  One of the first real ballads from Manson, this song was also a single with a cool video with it. Good song, another one of my lesser favs on the album, but a fitting closer for a great album.  Favorite lyric:  \\"Spread me open / Sticking to my pointy ribs / Are all your infants in abortion cribs.\\"<br /><br />99.) Hidden track, #99 (sometimes referred to as \\"Empty Sounds Of Hate\\")- Seems to me that this spoken word track serves as an extended version of the introduction to the album.  Favorite lyric:  \\"God will grovel before me / God will crawl at my feet.\\"<br /><br />I hope this review gives you some insight on one my favorite albums of all time. Untouchable - 5 stars.rstar\\" - A really rockin' song, and pretty much sums up the idea that people are hopelessly devoted to rock stars in every way (kinda like myself, hehe).

B003E8P9G0|4.0|This was very good. it wasnt as good as the pj series but has a promising start. cant wait *SPOILER* to find out where the real Zia is. spring 2011 come soon!
B0033B5XCS|3.0|***UPDATED REVIEW*** - (In light of the new Blu-Ray alternative collection that was recently released. This review was written long before the brand new (as of 2013) Blu-Ray upgraded box set of this film series) I will address the blu-ray box quickly, as I realize that recently I've gotten a lot of unhelpful votes b/c I didn't realize the Blu-Ray set had been recently released. And for all intents and purposes, the Blu-Ray collection is the best option for the major \\"Nightmare On Elm St.\\" fans that can't get enough, like myself.<br /><br />The ONLY negative thing about the Blu-Ray boxset is that as opposed to the newer DVD box set (which this review was originally written about, with me chastising it as a cash grab) is that \\"Freddy<br />vs. Jason\\" is NOT included in the new Blu-Ray collection. That is the Blu-ray set's only shortcoming really, and the new set handles the problems of that DVD re-release box set, and then some. Like I said originally, my review was not about the films themselves. It was about stripping the few bonus features from the previous \\"Nightmare\\" box set as a cash-grab around the time of the remake being released. The only way this new DVD set was superior to the other was that it DID include \\"Freddy vs. Jason\\", and in that respect, it's superior to the new Blu-Ray set. The Blu-ray set DOES NOT CONTAIN \\"Freddy Vs. Jason\\", and why, I don't know. A huge oversight. Even though \\"Freddy vs. Jason\\" wasn't nearly my favorite \\"Nightmare\\" film, lots of fans love it to death, and I like it every once in a while, and the new Blu-Ray set has the 1st 7 films, but not \\"Freddy Vs. Jason\\", which makes absolutely no sense, seeing that the DVD reissue had \\"FvJ\\"... and the blu-ray box has 2 films per disc, with COPIOUS amounts of bonus material, including many, many, many featurettes on every disc, deleted scenes, interviews, loads of behind the scenes info, a full documentary called, \\"Never Sleep Again: The Elm St. Legacy\\" that is absolutely great, however, \\"Never Sleep Again\\" was originally a 4-hour documentary on DVD, and in the new \\"Nightmare\\" Blu-Ray set, the 4-hour documentary is cut down to a measly 50 minutes or so. Kind of slack, considering that that documentary can be purchased in full, 4-hour form on DVD seperately. There are 2 episodes of \\"Freddy's Nightmares\\" - the spinoff TV show - and tons of other goodies available almost nowhere else. If you are a blu-ray customer, the Blu-Ray set IS THE WAY TO GO! Then you only have to buy \\"Freddy Vs. Jason\\" on your own, outside the box set.<br /><br />Now, for my original review of the inferior DVD re-release from several years ago, when there wasn't a good blu-ray option:<br /><br />First and foremost, I'm an avid \\"Nightmare\\" fan... My review of 3 stars is NOT my review of the movies themselves.  This is a review of the NEW \\"Nightmare\\" box-set which existed in a previous, superior form.  Just to cover the movies, however, here's how I rate them:<br /><br />1.) \\"A Nightmare On Elm Street\\" - - 5 stars.  An untouchable horror classic.<br />2.) \\"A Nightmare On Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\\" - - 3.5 stars, and underrated by most reviewers if you ask me.<br />3.) \\"A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors\\" - - 4.5 stars.<br />4.) \\"A Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master\\" - - 4 stars.<br />5.) \\"A Nightmare On Elm Street 5: The Dream Child\\" - - 3 stars, and a bit of a disappointment for this series.<br />6.) \\"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare\\" - - 3.5 stars.<br />7.) \\"Wes Craven's New Nightmare\\" - - 4.5 stars, another horror classic from Wes Craven.<br />8.) \\"Freddy vs. Jason\\" - 3 stars.  Not my favorite installment in the series, but many, many fans love it to death. I found Freddy's jokes to be corny (like always) but this time, in a poorly written way. The actors are very bad (especially the Destiny's Child chick), but the violence is quite awesome. This is more along the lines of \\"Bride Of Chucky\\" or \\"Seed Of Chucky\\" in that much of the film is a comedy, with some horror and guts splattered here and there. It's been a fan-favorite and the fans tend to love it a lot more than I do, but I still find value in it. If you thought his one-liners were cheesy in the other sequels, they are horrendous in \\"Freddy vs. Jason\\". Also the most atrocious scriptwriting in the entire series, but it's a horror film that got a bit of a ridiculous premise to execute well, so that's to be expected. The best way to view this one is to just have fun and try to love the good parts.<br /><br />Ok, now that we've got that out of the way, here's my problems with the NEW DVD box set.  I of course bought the original box set (released before \\"Freddy vs. Jason\\"), and although I felt the set should've had more extra features, at least it had SOME, as opposed to this new re-issue, which strips the old special features from the box set as well as all special features from the \\"Freddy vs. Jason\\" original DVD.  Another issue - none of these films have been remastered from the original DVD releases. You might think that because New Line Cinema remastered the original a few years ago (in the form of an \\"Infinifilm\\" release) that you will get the remastered version in this set.  You would be wrong, because you don't get the remastered version, you get the same version that was in the original box set.  Frustrating.  Another issue - I do have to say that Jackie Earle Haley's \\"Freddy\\" being featured on the cover is idiotic. Big deal or not, it doesn't make any g*d**n sense. We have eight films in this set, all of which feature Robert Englund as \\"Freddy\\", but to someone who hasn't seen the new remake, the cover has a stranger on it and is confusing (not to me, I've seen the remake and recognized Haley instantly). If they were going to feature Haley on the cover of the box set, they should have at least waited until the new remake is released on DVD, and then they could've included the remake in the box set. Not to mention that Haley cannot TOUCH Englund's portrayal of the classic horror character.  Haley being featured on the cover is disgraceful to Englund and his many glorious years performing as \\"Freddy\\". Yes, I do think it's kind of a big deal.<br /><br />Here's what you need to look at if you're considering buying all 8 of these films:<br /><br />If you want to go the cheapest route, and you're not interested in bonus features, you should buy \\"4 Film Favorites: Nightmare On Elm St. 1-4\\" and \\"4 Film Favorites: Nightmare On Elm St. 5-8\\". Two 4-disc sets, with the identical prints of the films in this box set, priced as low as 2.50 apiece used, or about 8 bucks apiece new.<br /><br />If you've got the money to spend, I would recommend buying the ORIGINAL box set (which comes in a larger, much cooler box, contains 3D glasses for the end of \\"Freddy's Dead\\" during the 3D sequence, and contains a bonus disc with a few special features), the remastered 2-disc Infinifilm version of the original \\"Nightmare On Elm Street\\" (for the bonus materials and the far superior audio / video quality), and a separate copy of \\"Freddy vs. Jason\\", which is also a 2-disc set (Remember, in this new box set, the 2nd disc of bonus features for \\"Freddy vs. Jason\\" have been stripped; as have ALL special features... this box set has none).<br /><br />I will definitely stick with my original box set, the Infinifilm Version of the original \\"Nightmare\\", and the \\"Freddy vs. Jason\\" DVDs, due to the lack of extra features and no remastering.

B00314VYNE|4.0|I just bought this doll at Target because my two young sons love to play \\"Toy Story\\" with their Buzz and Woody toys. This doll has a body similar to a Barbie doll. She is wearing a one-piece cowgirl suit, a removable belt, and removable boots. She also comes with a hat that does not really stay on. My children are enjoying playing with her and she seems durable. I didn't realize before buying her that her clothes came off. I might not have gotten her if I knew this, because I imagine that her boots or belt will eventually get lost. Note that the belt and boots could present a choking hazard to babies or toddlers.
B002ZG997C|1.0|A dum stroy of an evangelical fundamentalist, mixed with some fighting in a post-apocalyptic scenery, a waste of time and money if u ask me. I dont know anything about the DVD or its quality, but who cares if the movie is crapy.
1569242739|5.0|I'm not vegan, but I LOVE the results I get from these recipes.  They are incredibly moist and have beautiful texture.  The recipes are quick and easy, with concise, \\"real-person\\" instructions.  I have also substituted real milk for the soy, (still using the vinegar to create buttermilk substitute) and things turned out just as well.  This is a great cookbook.
0446569895|4.0|Although I'm not a big Ozzy fan, though I do tend to listen to his music from the time he was with Black Sabbith to his solo career.  While reading this I couldn't help but to laugh at some of the things he did whether it was his days with Black Sabbath or afterwards.  This book may be good for those who may not know that much about the Ozzman and want to know more about him, it won't disappoint at least to me it didn't.  There are things that went on that that I never knew that went on and some of the things can be heartbreaking when you read how it went down.  I recommend giving this book a read, and I give it 4 stars out of 5.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The opening shot is of Scarlett Johansson, but it's influenced by a painting by John Kacere, whose painting shows up later in the hotel. Actually, it is a shot of a certain portion of Scarlett Johansson's anatomy. Not bare, though. No, that would be gross. Not exactly her torso... lower... lower... there. The other side, now. Flip it over. That's it. Scarlett Johansson was reluctant to film this scene, but Sofia Coppola, the Director, modeled how the shot would look; and then she agreed to do it.<br /><br />This anecdote has me convinced that Sofia Coppola felt a strong identification with the main character. As a Director Sofia Coppola is willing to go that extra mile. Charlotte IS Sofia; but instead of John (Giovanni Ribisi), the photographer, it was her former husband, Spike Jonze, the director. He directed Cameron Diaz in Being John Malkovich, and perhaps Sofia felt kind of neglected, just like Charlotte--though Coppola denied the connection in an Entertainment Weekly interview.<br /><br />I know that writers use their own personal experience, and yet they change it, and they are not accountable for any similarity to any persons, living or dead. Especially themselves. But how many thinly veiled autobiographical first novels has the world seen?<br /><br />So, if Charlotte was Sofia, Kelly (Anna Faris) was Cameron, and John was Spike, who was Bob Harris? Who was the older gentleman that she had the Platonic Affair with? Was it John Malkovich? Really? John Malkovich?<br /><br />Why then, did she insist on casting Bill Murray, and only Bill Murray? Bill Murray doesn't even have an agent, and if anyone wants to hire him for anything, they have to leave voice mail on a number that he rarely, if ever, even listens to. Sofia left hundreds of messages for him. She flew to Japan to begin filming, and still she hadn't heard back from Murray. If he didn't show up, she was prepared to shut down the production. It most likely wasn't Bill Murray in real life, but Sofia knew that Bill Murray was the only one who could do the part justice. Unless it WAS Malkovich in real life, and she cast Malkovich. But that would blow her cover.<br /><br />The Japan in Lost in Translation was lost in translation. I think that all the Japanese stuff was merely an extended metaphor for feeling alienated from your environment. Like The Vapors song, Turning Japanese, it was a metaphor for something else. Japan is an interesting backdrop, but I think the movie is really about Bob and Charlotte. Karaoke and the neon lights of Tokyo are an interesting backdrop, but Lost in Translation is not about Japan, per se.<br /><br />If I can go off on one tangent per review, then I'd like to interject that Sofia Coppola is not David Lynch's daughter, and she did not make Boxing Helena. You take two famous directors with daughters, both trying to break into Hollywood as directors, and it is perfectly understandable that you might get them mixed up. But they are two distinct personalities. So don't blame Boxing Helena, one of, if not THE worst movie ever made, on Sofia Coppola (by the way, does anyone know where I could get a copy of boxing Helena?).<br /><br />--------------<br />Bob: Can you keep a secret?

It's going to take courage.<br />====================<br /><br />Bob Harris is brilliantly played by Bill Murray, and Bob's interactions with Charlotte/Scarlett are sublime. It is no wonder that Bill Murray was Sofia's choice. Every detail of his character rang true. Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin's \\"Fantaisie Impromptu\\" in C sharp minor, Opus 66 is the ring tone on Bob's cell phone. Murray played well not only with Johansson, but his constant befuddlement with the strange Japanese environment was quite entertaining.<br /><br />--------------<br />Bob: I don't want to leave.<br />Charlotte: So don't.

Cameron Diaz might not really be that thick, but if you were a neglected newlywed, it might seem like Diaz was your nitwitted nemesis, Kelly. Especially if your husband was directing her in Being John Malkovich while you were on the sidelines worrying. Charlotte is bothered by people like Kelly because Charlotte is smart, but she has yet to figure out what to do with her intelligence. Unless she can bring it out in some tangible form she will constantly be upstaged by those with little substance but a more dazzling surface--the Kellies of this world.<br /><br />For Sofia, the answer was to direct films. That would show Spike Jonze, Cameron Diaz, and most of all, her father, that she had a head on her shoulders. Too bad she had to make Marie Antoinette, and reverse that decision.<br /><br />The Bottom Line is that Sofia Coppola managed to direct a wonderful film, drawing on her own experience, but translating it into terms we all could understand.

1595825045|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2PJFBZWS3IN0J]]This is a wonderful art book for a spellbinding animation series. Making the series took 6 years, hundreds of artists, and hundreds of thousands of drawings. This book showcases a selection of some really beautiful illustrations.<br /><br />There are loads of character and background designs inside, in sketches and in their finished coloured form. The main characters like Aang and others come with cool animation sequences created with pencils. Also included are many of the discarded concepts which were difficult to animate or doesn't suit the story. Appa had some really awesome spiral horns but were discarded, unfortunately. The character drawings are superb. Just by looking at their different expressions you can pretty much guess their characteristics.<br /><br />Besides the characters which includes the town folks and soldiers, there are also drawings for many miscellaneous stuff like storyboards, airships, hybrid animals, wanted posters, promotional posters, chibi (or super deformed) style and random doodles from meetings.<br /><br />Did I mention the background paintings? The world created is so beautiful!<br /><br />The whole book is annotated heavily by Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino. They talk about everything on production, from creating the pilot episode to Nickelodeon approving the final season. You can see and read about their influences and inspiration everywhere, from Buddhism, Studio Ghibli, Gainax, Chinese martial arts, etc. It's very interesting to see how they apply what they learned from research to their drawings and animation.<br /><br />This is a fantastic art book for the series and fans, which should appeal to anyone who hasn't watch the series. Good art appeals to all.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B00386EZJU|5.0|Probably the best show of 2010 when it was released, \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" knows what it wants to be, both the movie and soundtrack.  John Powell's score is full of excitement, drama, emotions, and courage, perfectly reflecting the mood of the movie.  There are quiet moments to be had, funny ones as well, and this soundtrack brings them all out, even without the great movie scenes accompanying them.
B002FOQY2M|4.0|I love this record. The melodies are adhesive, the vocals are dynamic and the arrangements are cinematic. There were moments (many) on this record when I thought I was listening to Queen!
B000VBIGD6|3.0|Chevy Chase is always, at the very least, interesting to watch.  Since his one-year stint on SNL (and one tends to forget that it was that brief a stay), he seems to pretty much have had a corner on the snarky, self-referential humor market.  Bill Murray and Steve Martin, you could say, were kind of operating in the same universe for a long time, but they've actually been able to move on beyond that, at least a good deal of the time.  Chevy--as good as he can be at what he does--does not seem a likely candidate for an Oscar or for recognition for his efforts at serious literature or drama.    And I'm fine with that, but his movies have been so spotty really that I find myself wishing that he had indeed stuck it out a few seasons more at 30 Rockefeller Plaza after all.  He was a solid skit comedian, after all, and a few more seasons of him in that capacity (preserved on DVD for generations yet to come) might have solidified his rep, more so than most of his movies could ever do And let's not even bring up the talk show debacle, except to offer it as proof that a brilliant skit comedian really can't be assumed to be able to do it all.  If anything, we might assert that Chase was a performer whose best work was \\"in character,\\" but whose characterizations might not be able to sustain a two hour movie.    The LAMPOON VACATION series merged at least two of the personae that Chase cultivated on SNL, the bumbling klutz he used in his Jerry Ford take-offs and the sardonic wisea$$ he used on WEEKEND UPDATE.  For good measure, he threw in a riff on your standard sit-com dad, who was not only a bit of a bumbler, but one with a real serious DARK SIDE.  Imagine, Ward Cleaver possessed by Satan.  Or if not quite that, one with very serious ANGER issues.  It's not all that pretty.  And come to think of it, not everyone will find it (him) all that amusing.      Behind all the slapstick and broad humor, there's a real bitter streak in this film.  It seems reflective of a real ambivalence towards, if not a downright cynicism about, how Christmas is celebrated in this county--a sentiment that Chase surely shared with writher/producer John Hughes.  Sure there's a (tongue in cheek) taste of CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS optimism here: you know what I mean, the sense that the holidays are worth celebrating despite the commercialism, the family dramas, the overwhelming stress, and all the things that lead to holiday depression.  But there's no \\"sincere\\" Christmas tree: just ridiculously grandiose ones or makeshift substitutes after the first one is destroyed. And there's no Linus figure gently pointing out the \\"true meaning of Christmas.\\"  There's some lip service to such sentiments at the movie's end, but it's really not to be believed.  Everything suggests that Chevy Chase's Clark Griswold character has only succeeded in fooling himself, perhaps only very briefly, that his disastrous holiday was in fact a successful celebration of the season after all.    The movie left me drained.  I was up for a bit of absurdity, a bit of high jinks and, yes, a dollop or two of what might be loosely termed \\"social criticism.\\"  I didn't expect--nor do I ever expect of a post-modern comedy--a somewhat tricked out re-make of A WONDERFUL LIFE.  On the other hand, this one just left me with a bad taste in my mouth.
0307454541|4.0|As a diehard mystery lover who's read the body of work of many authors, I found this story a nice, tightly woven locked-room-style tale set in rural Sweden. We are introduced to an interesting cast of characters whose interactions and relationships develop in a most engaging way. Though some readers will find the resolutions a bit predictable, we find ourselves liking these people so much we want to learn more about them. Fortunately there is a sequel.
B0039SFKSW|5.0|I was brought up on Yes, King Crimson, and ELP.  I remember the first Asia album, and although it was good, it was too pop for me.  I decided to check this latest venture out when I saw Wetton, Palmer, and Howe (not too familiar with the old Buggles guy except for his Drama work with Yes) were in the group now.  The first song blew me away.  Howe has an edgier tone to his guitar and less of the Oriental whining he sometimes gets into with Yes.  I've always equated Howe with Robert Fripp (King Crimson):  sometimes turning in gorgeous guitar work, but often delving into the atonal sounds that both are famous for.  This is not a knock on them:  they are truly gifted, and I have every Yes and King Crimson album.  I think Fripp and Howe could get along very easily if they were time warped into the middle ages or the Renaissance era.  They could play absolutely anything.<br /><br />Wetton's vocals are strong, and his writing is as good as anything around these days.  Palmer, brought up on Buddy Rich techniques (that dancing left hand), can play with anyone.  Truly a remarkable percussionist, and he provides the great rhythm section with Wetton.  He doesn't shine much, but he does have one song in which he's very busy.  He does what drummers are supposed to do:  complement the music, not take over.  Downes plays very well.  Nothing extraordinary, but solid.<br /><br />So why 5 stars?  I didn't find a track I didn't like, and it's really an honor to hear these guys still giving us great music after all these years.  I may go back and listen to a few of the other Asia LPs now.  Who knows what else I've missed.
B00275EGX8|1.0|We've all heard the same old Hollywood mantra repeated ad nauseum: downloaded films fund fear/terror/crime/jihad/drugs/atheism/paedophilia, etc. and cost the industry and its overpaid \\"talent\\" untold millions in so-called lost revenue. However, Hurt Locker is set to put a new spin on that by actually making more money from prosecuting its audience over allegedly infringing downloads than it made at the box office. I don't think I have the stomach to recommend a film that seeks to criminalise its audience, and nor could I support it by shelling out for a DVD. I haven't seen this film; nor, on principal, do I want to--via any means.  Hurt Locker, there goes another lost sale ...
B001FB5634|5.0|Relentless. That's the best one-word description of \\"The Road.\\" Relentless.<br /><br />The world has ended. That happens in the first few minutes. Beautiful color, beautiful flowers, life as it is, life-to-be (Viggo Mortensen's wife is pregnant). Then flames. But not direct flames. Director John Hillcoat would not have the viewer concentrate on the destruction, but on the result of the destruction. The flames are seen through diaphanous curtains. Who lives? Who \\"makes it\\"? Who defies the odds? This is not the story of destruction, but, oddly, one of life.<br /><br />Then fast-forward about nine, ten years. Dark. Desolate. Grimy. Stark. Utter destruction. A dying earth. Few people. No animals. Devastation everywhere.<br /><br />\\"The Road\\" focuses on two players, father and son, with the road as powerful a symbol as I've ever seen. Papa (Viggo) is a loving, gentle man (now and before) who is driven to get his son to the Pacific coast. Why? We're never told, it's a psychic thing, an archetype of major magnitude. The road to the coast! It's life-rendering.<br /><br />However, this is a film that defies review writing because of the likely possibility of inadvertently providing potential spoilers. Since there is little more I can say, I want to express impressions.<br /><br />1. Director Hillcoat made an excellent choice with Mortensen, who has that \\"sweetness\\" of character necessary for this role, yet can also play killers.<br />2. Exact costuming is essential and very successful.<br />3. Humanity in both its extremes is expressed. That powerful will-to-survive can manifest in anyone.<br />4. Will-to-survive: What causes one person to have it and another not to? Although this will-to-survive is not the major issue here, the director does cause the viewer to consider it. Is man born with hope beyond all reason? Is this a good thing or not? Charlize Theron's character gives us another answer.<br />5. If will-to-survive is a predominating factor, is there room for loving kindness toward one's fellow survivors?<br />6. That consideration raises the main questions of the film: Who are the good people? What makes good people in this apocalyptic devastation? The answers are absolutely definitive and brook no deviation: We don't eat people. We carry the fire.<br /><br />Although the ending is manipulated (with Author Cormac McCarthy and Director Hillcoat as gods/creators with intentional plans), it is perfect as closure to the plot's premise and then development.<br /><br />I wish I could say more. I had no idea what my reaction to the film would be, knowing in advance that it is depressing. Although it is depressing, make no mistake about that, it is also strangely uplifting. It shows man at his best even during the worst.eration raises the main questions of the film: Who are the good people? What makes good people in this apocalyptic devastation?

0385342020|4.0|I have yet to meet a Sophie Kinsella novel that I don't like. Kinsella remains true to her lighthearted, hilarious style with Twenties Girl and I, for one, am grateful for it.<br /><br />Lara is comparable to the rest of Kinsella's heroines: sweet, idealistic, and a bit ditzy (but not so much that you end up hating her). Of course the plot is rather far-fetched, but that's what you should expect and want when picking up a Kinsella book. It just makes the story that much more enjoyable.<br /><br />Lara and the ghost of her great-aunt, Sadie, make such a fun and complementary duo. When Lara bumbles around, Sadie serves to just throw even more hurdles in her path. Like in her other novels, Kinsella isn't just all about the laughs here. The importance of family, friendship, loyalty and honesty are all major focuses throughout the plot. And, of course, there's the romantic subplot involving a hero, Ed, who's more sweet than sexy, lending to the overall pleasant feeling about the novel.<br /><br />Any fans of Kinsella's previous work will absolutely want to pick this one up. Those apprehensive about starting her Shopaholic series might think about reading Twenties Girl first to get a feel for her style. I recommend it, but I may be a bit biased due to my total adoration of all things Kinsella.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This novel is a continuation of the previous in the series (Girl Who Played With Fire). The proliferation of characters with difficult (Swedish) names, and reference to the events of the earlier novels make it very confusing if you read the other two novels a year or so ago. If you did not read them at all---read them now, in sequence.  These absorbing thrillers are too good to miss, but get increasingly dependent on events occurring, and characters introduced and developed in the first two books of the trilogy.
0439813786|5.0|This is easily one of the coolest books I have read in a long while. This book appeals to a wide audience with varied reading abilities and engages the reader.    Starting off like a silent film, this book has graphic and textual elements that work simultaneously in the telling of the story. While this is reminiscent of the silent films of the late 19th and early 20th centuries this style of writing hearkens back to the work of William Blake as well. In Blake's work, as in Selznick's, the art is as valuable to the story as the text. Selznick's images transcend simple illustrations.    The illustrations are exquisite and the highly detailed style of pencil drawing brings to mind Shaun Tan's \\"The Arrival\\".     An excellent story with a lovely historical connection to one of the pioneers of film.

B002RKS81O|5.0|I hadn't read this before and even though I had wanted to for years, I never got around to it.  I'm so glad I finally did!  Gosh, such a great story.  I love it.  One of the reasons I finally decided to read it, is because my sister got me [[ASIN:1594744424 Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters]] for my birthday.  I didn't want to read that before I read the actual Jane Austen story it's based on!  I might skip the Sea Monster story and just read this one again, though.  It was amazing.<br /><br />I read this on my Kindle for PC and reading it on my computer was easy on my eyes and I finished it off in a couple days.  If you don't have a Kindle, I recommend downloading and installed the Kindle for PC.  There are many free Kindle books available and I really was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use.  Honestly, my eyes did not get tired at all.

B003UYUR10|3.0|First of all let me tell you this: This is Not Pirates of the Caribbean, so for the ones who like (or like me love) the pirates trilogy you better start lowering your expectations when you walk into this film.<br />When I heard about Prince of Persia I did not pay too much attention to it. It did not interest me the way pirates did so when I went to see it I did not expect anything spectacular. Well, let me tell you that I was reasonably satisfied throughout the film.<br /><br />Like any Bruckheimer film, Prince of Persia offers a spectacular scenery with tons of elaborate action sequences, elaborate costumes, elaborate makeup, elaborate chase scenes and elaborate special effects. The locations are fantastic and you can see the amount of work the crew had to do in order to achieve this epic. The plot is interesting enough to keep you entertained and the cast acts reasonably okay. I was surprised that I was enyojing the film more than I expected and overall it is a good summer film. The score by Harry Gregson-Williams really adds to what you are seeing in the screen.<br /><br />Now, the bad stuff. Though the plot is interesting, some lack in the script prevents the film to achieve new heights. This is no help when you have one-note characters in the entire film. When I said the cast acted reasonably fine, is because I think that the actors did the best with characters that can't be worked too much. So if you were expecting another Jack Sparrow, well, don't expect too much. Dastan is your typical hero with typical hero problems and typical hero quests. I think Jake Gyllenhaal did a fair job with the character but he is not Johnny Depp and Dastan is not Jack Sparrow. Other lacking characters were Princess Tamina and Nizam (the villain). The first is played by Gemma Arterton who I think was the low point in terms of acting. The latter is played by the great Ben Kingsley who unfortunately does not have enough material to work with. Don't expect villains like Barbossa or Davy Jones because Nizam is your typical villain without any charm. The high point was Alfred Molina as a dishonest trader who was at the same time comic relief and the best character in the film.<br /><br />Overall, with this minor problems, I was enjoying the film until we reached the end. It was utterly disappointing making the whole plot of the film to not have any sense. I won't spoil anything but let me tell you that the end was the reason I graded the film 3 stars instead of four. Let's hope that if there are any sequels, they will work this out in the next one.<br /><br />Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time was a pleasant experience and a good summer film. It has some problems (especially the end) that prevents it to become something greater but overall it serves its purpose of entertaining and it is better than some things out there. If you go with low or mild expectations, you will be fine.<br /><br />PD: Can't wait to see Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (May 20, 2011).e Nizam is your typical villain without any charm.

B002N5N4M6|4.0|I'm looking forward to getting the 3rd season on DVD. There still are some interesting places for the characters to go, so I'm curious as to how the writers will handle this. The series finale hinted at a possible romantic relationship for Sheldon, which should be interesting in several dimensions.     Now I think the writers need to give Penny more to do- we know she's from Nebraska and has a brother, but beyond that there's not much background. What's her last name? We've seen (or heard) the other characters' parents- what are Penny's parents like? It would be fun to see Penny finally get some modeling or acting work. If I were one of the show's writers, I would put together an episode or two where Penny gets a bit part in a low budget sci-fi movie, and the guys overwhelm her with suggestions on costume and lines and keeping the science real.    Anyway, TBBT is one of my favorite shows, and I'm hoping for a great 4th season.
1400062756|4.0|I read this book with some familiarity of Dweck's research, but the depth of topics covered is really amazing in this book. However, at times, I found the attempts at folksy writing a bit frustrating. The book jumps between a description of research to more \\"inspirational\\" passages: \\"Does this remind you of yourself?\\" It's interesting, because the mindsets aren't consistent - you can have a \\"fixed mindset\\" in one area, and a \\"growth mindset\\" in another. Finding and being cognizant of a mindset in one area can help you control your mindset. I think that alone makes the book worthwhile.

0375413405|4.0|The book was in top condition.  Just like new.  The owner must have carfully preserved it.  I have no complaints.  This was a good experience.  I am reading the book to learn what I need to start cooking.  I can't wait to try all the recipe's.
B000002KOO|4.0|I have read some reviews of \\"Then Play On\\" which describe the album as a five-star \\"classic\\" album, but I want to provide a bit of perspective and a slightly contrary opinion for the benefit of people who are thinking about buying the album.  I'm writing this review to hopefully inform the prospective purchaser, who may think of Fleetwood Mac as that mid-70s, early-80s pop band and may be disappointed to hear that this earlier version of Fleetwood Mac on \\"Then Plays On\\" bears little semblance to that later version.  Then, also, I know that some music listeners read about an album being declared a \\"classic\\" and think that it's indispensable, and are disappointed when it turns out that the expectations exceed the reality.  Also, this is a review of the music, but I feel compelled to describe the mastering of the \\"Then Play On\\" compact disc as atrocious, and quite harsh to listen to.  But if you're like me, if the quality of the music merits the suffering, then you'll listen.      While \\"Then Play On\\" is one of my all-time favorite records, this falls a bit short of attaining \\"classic\\" status.  Peter Green, the founder and driving force of the original incantation of Fleetwood Mac, was (and still is, though his playing now is but a shadow of his former abilities, though still very good) my favorite non-African/American blues musician, and \\"Then Play On\\", his final record with Fleetwood Mac (except for the \\"Green Manalishi/World in Harmony\\" single) presents him at his artistic peak.  However, this album is a very good, but flawed farewell for \\"the Green god\\".  While the good songs (\\"Oh Well\\", \\"Before the Beginning\\", \\"Show-Biz Blues\\", \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\", \\"Like Crying\\", \\"Coming Your Way\\", \\"Closing My Eyes\\" and \\"Underway\\") are exceptionally good, the remainder of the album is pretty much filler.      There are three instrumentals on the record--\\"Underway\\", \\"Searching for Madge\\", and \\"Fighting for Madge\\", of which only \\"Undersay\\" has any semblance of actual structure (andit's a beautiful piece of guitar playing).  The \\"Madge\\" instrumentals allow the band to jam, but for a studio release, their inclusion feels superfluous.  That said, having heard the \\"Boston Tea Party\\" 24-minute live version of \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\" that incorporates the \\"Madge\\" jams (and \\"Underway\\", as well) within the context of a live performance and the structure of an actual song, I can hear the musical merits of the \\"Madge\\" jams, but for a studio album, such jams seem rather pointless, as if trying to pad the length of the record.  In the past, the band had mixed original material with covers of blues standards, and it seems like the band wanted \\"Then Play On\\" to be an all-original effort, but the band seems to have just run out of strong original material.  The remaining Danny Kirwan songs (\\"When You Say\\", \\"Although the Sun is Shining\\") are musically interesting, but lyrically weightless, as if they were both rushed rather than worked out.  Because of release schedules and studio time limits, it seems that the band's desire to make the album all-original material forced them into recording some half-finished songs.    When I think of a \\"classic\\" album, I don't require that all of the songs on the album be great songs, but I feel that all of the songs should be, at least, well thought-out and executed.  Thus, by such standards, in my opinion (and opinions vary, of course), \\"Then Play On\\" falls short of being a \\"classic\\" album.  But it still a great album, with many excellent songs.  \\"Oh Well\\" is simply one of the most moving, wry, lovely, innovative, and impressive songs that I've ever heard, shifting from country blues to classical guitar in a seamless journey.  The classical guitar of Part Two of \\"Oh Well\\" is lengthy, but this allows the beauty of Green's playing to develop, grow, and flow at its own pace.  In fact, there is a pronouced country blues feel to \\"Then Play On\\", with Part One of \\"Oh Well\\", \\"Show-Biz Blues\\", and \\"Like Crying\\", contrasting with the more modern (and non-standard) blues structures of \\"Before the Beginning\\" and \\"Closing My Eyes\\".  Then there is the rocking crunch of \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\" and \\"Coming Your Way\\" to get your butt shakin', and it is evident that Fleetwood Mac isn't just a \\"blues band\\" that can play rock, but that this is a band that can play a widely diverse range of musical styles with a world-class level of competency.  Alas, all those instrumentals and weak songs--the filler.    Despite my reservations about classifying \\"Then Play On\\" as a \\"classic\\" album, this IS a GREAT album, that I DO STRONGLY RECOMMEND.  It's not \\"indispensable\\"--not for everybody's tastes, certainly not for the unadventurous listener--but if you're interested in hearing some innovative takes on bluesy rock (heck, bluesy CLASSICAL) music, then BUY THIS ALBUM.  There's some filler here, but there's a lot of great music here, too.  A STRONG FOUR-STAR RECORD, and one of my favorites.
0446569895|4.0|I'd like to say that I'm a big Ozzy fan and he's full of interesting stories.  Considering his background, I knew that there would be tales like the ones in his book.  The book is pretty funny, but I couldn't get past how many f-bombs they included.  It brings a degree of authenticity as it sounds like Ozzy's actually talking to you, but it gets old after a while, so I couldn't read many chapters at once.  As for the previous reviewer mentioning the Jake E. Lee era omission, I don't think Ozzy remembers that era.
B00004U680|4.0|SUZI QUATRO  *****<br />The 1973 debut album by one of rock's first women is an under-rated rock classic. With a sound that is a mixture of hard rock and boogie, it is an undeniably unique package.<br /><br />Suzi Quatro's multitude of European, Japanese and Australian hit singles were all written by Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn. '48 Crash', one of the biggest and hardest rocking of these appear here, along with a sexy pre-historic odyssey entitled `Primitive Love'. (The Australian release of this album is entitled '[[ASIN:B000006X47 Can the Can]]' and includes that smash hit rocker as well.) But the success of this album rides, not on the strength of that song-writing partnership, but on the writing of Quatro herself and soon-to-be husband, guitarist Len Tuckey ('Glycerine Queen', 'Shine My Machine', 'Skin Tight Skin' are definite highlights).<br /><br />Quatro's vocals are strong and authoritative, while conveying just a glimpse of vulnerability. The trademark scream that made her famous is also in full flight. Chinn-Chapman's production is full and textured, driving the music with an awesome drum sound (Dave Neal), Quatro's slick bass, and Tuckey's guitar being rounded out by some beautiful keyboards from Alistair McKenzie.<br /><br />Though this album has an overall sound and style that places it firmly in the rock of the pre-punk 70s, you would be hard pressed to find anything else that sounds quite like it, nor a rock debut that is as confident and energetic.<br /><br />QUATRO ***<br />With a string of big hits and a successful first album making the leather-clad, pants-wearing Quatro pretty much a household brand for rock and roll rebellion outside of America, the pressure was presumably on to produce another rocking screamer that would continue the momentum. The result - 1974's `[[ASIN:B00000734V Quatro]]' - is, like many \\"difficult\\" second albums, disappointing.<br /><br />Though again sporting slick rock production and a number of compositions from the Mike Chapman/ Nicky Chinn team, this effort sadly replaces the song-writing of Quatro and guitarist Len Tuckey with a host of covers of 50s and 60s staples - though they are, admittedly, stirlingly executed.<br /><br />The whole thing has an update-the-50s-with-a-modern-70s-polish feel. But, other than in her obvious powers as a rock interpreter, `Quatro' lacks any real stamp of Quatro as an artist. In fact, its dearth of self-penned work, in addition to the continued pro-written singles, is probably one of the major reasons rock commentators discount her as a serious artist.ly replaces the song-writing of Quatro and guitarist Len Tuckey with a host of covers of 50s and 60s staples - though they are, admittedly, stirlingly executed.

B0000074FL|4.0|Lizzy was very near the end when `Renegade' made its first appearance in late 1981 as both Philip Lynott and Scott Gorham struggled with their drug addictions. As a result many critics and fans have blasted the album as the band's worst which is very harsh and not accurate. Is it uneven or inconsistent? Possibly, and there was even a question of what the material that made up the LP was best suited or intended for; a Lizzy record or Philip's latest solo record. What can't be denied to true Thin Lizzy aficionados is that the title track is a moody masterpiece and a song that Philip usually could put together in his sleep but such efforts were becoming increasingly difficult. \\"Angel of Death\\" is another highlight, a much heavier rocker and not characteristic of the album as a whole (Lynott and new member, keyboardist Darryl Wharton wrote it).  \\"Hollywood\\" would be the only single of note and in many ways was typical of past Lizzy hits. Other tracks of note include \\"The Pressure Will Blow\\" and \\"It's Getting Dangerous\\" the latter being another late date confessional in the traditions of \\"Got to Give it Up\\" and \\"Sugar Blues\\".  `Renegade' was also be the final bow of guitarist Snowy White whose reputation in Lizzy took a hit as both of his records commercially tanked.  `Renegade' is very good and not a disaster that it has been proclaimed in reviews and interviews. It is very much Lizzy's `Night in the Ruts'; a difficult album to make under the cloud of a band's impending doom.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Great Album. The lyrics, beats, flow and choruses blend together beautifully. For a Rapper and a Reggae artist to collaborate on a full length CD first of all is rare, and more than likely it does not bode well for most rapper/reggae artists.     But these two have a natural chemistry musically, maybe it's they're love for music, lyrics or Africa. Who Knows?     Truly an amazing album!
1442300051|5.0|Unless you were actually working on these products (or buying them) the CDS market is a bit of an enigma - but you're pretty sure that it had something to do with the fall of Lehman Brothers, and therefore the collapse of the financial system.  Enter Lewis' lastest masterpiece, which explains almost everything that you wanted to know about about these exotic products, how they are created, and how the banks went too far (way too far) in what they were collateralizing (and selling). The book is actually about the winners of the financial crises - those who made bets that the crises would in fact happen.  But, it sheds a lot of color on all the players - sell side, buy side, rating agencies, etc.  This book is very informative and very funny.       Mine was a book on CD, but this has to be the most entertaining and engaging book on CD ever.  I would pull into my garage after work, but would not go inside right away - I would sit in the car, anxious, listening intently until the end of the chapter.  Its that good.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|I've always liked Metallica. I remember when they came up through the Los Angeles and then San Francisco heavy metal music scenes. They were something of an outrage, of course, but an attractive outrage. I also found their MTV videos compelling viewing, back in the days when MTV was all videos. Real good band, albeit somewhat turbulent. Excellent and non-compromising. Very distinct signature sound.<br /><br />Well, some years ago I read about Metallica producing a concert in conjunction with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. Heavy Metal with a symphony orchestra? Who ever thought this one up? Well, I finally got around to ordering the video. My wife and I viewed it a couple nights ago. It's a two-disc DVD and we viewed it on two nights. Outstanding! Absolutely stunning! It's one of the best rock-concert videos I've ever viewed. Both the audience and the atmosphere is totally unlike any symphony concert I've ever attended, that's for sure. Basically, it's a greatest hits album with a couple new songs added. Both the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and Metallica were really up for this one and the audience loved it. It's a strange mixture of musical styles, but it works and makes for compelling viewing and listening. Who knows? Maybe this will be one of America's greatest contributions to classical music. Awesome!<br /><br />Gary Peterson
1400052173|5.0|Disclosure:  I was a researcher who used HeLa cells for many years.  The general understanding regarding the name, HeLa, was that it stood for Helen Lane, a pseudonym designed to protect the identity of the patient, which it did for decades until someone made an unethical breach revealing patient records to a reporter.    Most of the reviews I have read complain that the cells were taken without consent and that vast riches have been gleaned at the expense of the Lacks family.  In addition there is accusation that white scientists have exploited impoverished African American patients with clear racist impications.  Most of these allegations are completely false.      While the tissue biopsy was taken without consent, this was common practice at the time and many years would pass before informed consent would be introduced.  The researcher who successfully cultured the cells, Dr. Gey, visited Ms Lacks in the hospital and informed her of the cultures, to which she expressed a hope that they would be useful. This is described in the book. Hundreds of thousands of samples have been collected from patients in the same manner and are currently used for research and stored frozen.  The unique property of HeLa cells that made them so useful then and now is their ease of culture.  Other extremely useful features are that they do not die after several doublings, but are immortalized, and also that they grow in suspension culture, allowing large quantities to be grown without undue labor and expense.    In my experience, cultures were freely exchanged between scientists on request.  I never heard of anyone purchasing them.  Maintenance of a cell line does require some effort, and if anyone wishes to perform this service they are entitled to a fee.  The ATCC does this, but it should be emphasized that it is a non-profit organization.  The implication that huge fortunes were made by commercializing these cells is likely to be fantasy.  Johns Hopkins and George Gey did not patentthe cells or restrict their use;  indeed, they gave them away to any researcher who might find them useful.  If the cells had received a patent, it would have long since expired and anyone who wished could have used them for free since around 1970.    Lastly, the book points out that Johns Hopkins was intentionally located in a poor section of Baltimore in order to be of service to the underprivileged.  The allegation that it exploits poor African Americans is disingenuous and unfair to the dedicated men and women who work there in service to science and medicine.    In closing, I will add my voice to the chorus of appreciative readers who were entertained and informed by this brilliantly written book.  My only reservation is that some wrong conclusions were drawn by implication.  While scientific inquiry was greatly enhanced through the use of HeLa cells as an investigational vehicle, the Lacks family does not have legal claim to compensation any more than they can rightly claim the royalties from this book.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|It's a fun game, fairly simple as well. You roll dice and pass the cup around once your done rolling. If you get 3 shotgun blasts, you die and lose all your points and start back at zero. The object is to get brains, you need thirteen brains to win. So you may roll and get a few and then start getting a couple too many shotgun blasts for comfort, so you pass and keep the brains you have and wait for it to come back around to you. Each dice is a different color, some dice have more chances of a shotgun blast, others a brain, there are also feet which means the victim escaped and you cannot re roll those dice until the cup passes to the next person.<br /><br />It's a fun little game in between playing let's say a big RPG campaign or such.

0439023483|5.0|This post-apocalyptic novel is part of a long tradition of dystopic worlds.  Adults are going to recognize a number of the themes from other novels, but that doesn't diminish the fact that Ms. Collins did a  superb job of pulling the pieces together in a new way.  The main character is a girl who is flawed, afraid, and verging on losing her morality.  That's hardly surprising given that she's been forced into the Hunger Games, a series of gladiator-style battles used to demoralize the colonies who once had the nerve to rebel against the capital.  I really enjoyed watching Katniss struggle with her feelings, her need to kill and her reluctance to do so.  Peeta is a little less believable--putting himself into terrible situations in order to advance Katniss' chances in the games, but self-sacrifice and naivete are staples in YA romance, so that didn't distract from how much I enjoyed the story.    The world building really is remarkable.  Rather than dump a lot of information at once, the story slowly lets details slip until we realize that this is America after the fall of the government.  We figure out that Katniss is from a part of the country that has always been impoverished and short on hope, and that hasn't changed.  The way Katniss slowly learns that hunger and discrimination can be advantages is believable and powerful.      The ending is just as ambiguous and complex as the book.  Katniss herself doesn't understand her feelings, and that makes sense considering the trauma she has just been through.  For adults, I think that the characters are going to feel a little shallow just because Ms. Collins has done a credible job of creating ego-centric teens who don't always see past the end of their own nose.  For teens, I think this is going to be a real favorite.      Any reader who enjoyed The Giver in grade school should definitely read this in high school (and then hopefully move on to Brave New World, 1984, Fahrenheit 451, The Handmaid's Tale and all the other more subtle books that deal with similar themes).

068484267X|1.0|Do not buy this book. That is unless, of course, you enjoy books that have no story and shallow, annoying, pathetic characters. Then again, you may take pleasure in immersing yourself in 400 pages of depression, poverty, woe, alcoholism, misery and child abuse. I could only stomach 40 pages before I realized that the ENTIRE book was going to be like an extended, nightmarish trip to the dentist. I kept waiting for the voice to change and for the story to actually BEGIN. Neither happen. Do yourself a favor and find something else to read.     Angela's Ashes is nothing more than a poorly-written, self-indulgent pity party.
B0024RID60|2.0|Maybe I'm missing something profound compared to all the other reviewers here, but as someone who has thoroughly enjoyed all the Stones golden period discs meaning Beggars Banquet onwards up to and including \\"Tattoo You\\", I personally find \\"Some Girls\\" to be their weakest disc throughout this whole period(1968 - 1981) With the vital exception of the brilliant \\"Miss You\\" and the mildly appealing \\"Beast of Burden\\", to my ears the vast majority of this disc contains pedestrian \\"samey sounding\\" songs which are not particularly strong in the tunes department and the overall playing is not tremendously inspired either. Sorry about the contrarian viewpoint but this is just to warn any potential buyers of this disc who may be overtempted the gushing reviews of how fantastic the album is. For my money, check out the criminally underrated \\"groove trilogy\\" specifically  \\"Goat Heads Soup\\", \\"Its Only Rock N Roll\\" and \\"Black and Blue\\", these discs are funky and souful.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|I'll say at the outset that I'm a fan of Mr. Moore's work and that my views tend to coincide with his.  But, even if you're a libertarian-leaning conservative, I suspect that you'll tend to agree with Moore's analysis and you'll not find Mr. Moore's presentation too partisan to listen to.  This documentary tends toward Mr. Moore's less sarcastic side: like \\"Sicko,\\" it's very focused, very thoughtful (conservative Fox News critics praised \\"Sicko\\").  If you had never seen Moore's work before, you might think that a more traditional libertarian-conservative had done \\"Capitalism, A Love Story.\\"  I rate it five stars.  There's some of Michael Moore's characteristic humor, but, on the whole, it's very matter of fact.      I don't think this film caught on with the public as it should have: local theaters censored it (it was not played in my locale at all, even though this metro area contains about 150,000 people).  Local theater managers blocked Bill Maher's excellent \\"Religulous\\" film, also.  I guess that the secret of conservative success in America is just to block out competing ideas.  I hope this review doesn't get censored, too (sometimes, Amazon won't post them).

B0002GTWQA|4.0|Lord Jim (1965) a film starring Peter O'Toole, James Mason, Curd Jurgens, and Eli Wallach, is based on Joseph Conrad's novel of the same name.  There is another film of the same name from 1925 directed by Victor Fleming, but this isn't it.  This one was made a few years after Peter O'Toole won one of the seven Oscars awarded to Lawrence of Arabia.  Alas, this picture is no Lawrence, but we get to see young O'Toole play another moody man seeking redemption.  O'Toole does this part so well, the picture gets four of five stars.  O'Toole also plays in Murphy's War (1971)as a lone survivor of a ship sunk by a Nazi U Boat and he sets out to sink it.  It seems his roles were typecast after Lawrence of Arabia, but the scripts didn't get much better for him for a long while.    O'Toole's character Jim begins as a narrative by Jack Hawkins, telling us of Jim's potential to rise to great expectations.  Like many hopes and dreams of youth, Jim's takes a turn when he is faced with a moment of cowardice while serving as the first mate on the S.S. Patna; an aging vessel carrying Muslims traveling to Mecca as it's cargo.  A simular incident was known to Conrad in 1880 when he heard of the S.S. Jeddah also abandoned by it's British crew during bad weather.  The Jeddah was rescued by a French ship and towed to shore, just as the Patna was rescued and waiting in port when Jim and the crew of the Patna came ashore in their life boat.  Disgrace came to the crew of the Jeddah just as it did to Jim.  I suppose the reason I did not give Lord Jim five stars is because of this second part of the movie when Jim attempts to redeem himself through various self sacrificing deeds.  It's painful to watch as Jim goes through the inner torment that comes with dishonoring oneself and lives to regret it over and over again.  This fear and poor decision based on panic is what confronts every person at least once during thier life and only a few sieze the moment to bring honor instead of disgrace.  That's what forgiveness is for, but Jim seems never to learn this and move on.  Although it is very difficult to move on for many of us.  I told my son, before he left for the military that there is something worst than death, it is living without honor.  Lord Jim is what I think of as a man who lives without honor.  The other characters in the film (Jurgens, Mason, Wallach)  are the examples of men living without honor and finding reasons to stay in that dishonorable life, robbing others, lying, cheating, murdering.  Jim is on the other end of dishonor, trying to make up for it by his good deeds.  All the while secretly suicidal, knowing he can never live up to the measure he has placed in front of him that will erase his past deed of dishonor, always threatening to reveal his true character.  In the end he gives into his fear of discovery and allows dishonorable men to challenge him for what they want most; the gold in the village-the love of money is the root of all evil.  And Jim trys to get what he wants most; a chance to be a hero and redeem himself-pride comes before a fall.  You can guess what happens without me telling you.  Neither gets what they want in the end.  A familiar tale.  One that we all know to be painful to watch in others, let alone live it in ourself.  It is a well done movie and O'Toole seems to be well suited for these roles.  If you are young (younger than I) then you may not find this movie to be as gut wrenching as I did.  If you have not found forgiveness in this life, it will be equally disturbing for you.  Just know that forgiveness is available.  I hope you are open to it when it comes.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I typically use my iPod at the gym while working out.  I have small ears and can't use earbuds; I have yet to find a pair that will stay in my ears, so I am constantly readjusting earbuds and usually can't hear well.<br /><br />These headphones are light, comfortable and stay in my ears.  Typically I listen to podcasts rather than music, and the sound quality is more than adequate for that.<br /><br />I have used this type of headphone in the past, and they do have a finite life, but then again they are fairly inexpensive.  This time I bought two pair so I have a spare if the first set breaks.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I live in the Pacific Northwest where it rains nearly 300 days a year and indoor options for exercise are essential.  I give this workout 5 stars despite some gripes.  I'll start with those and then tell you why you should still get it:  Gripes: I have never watched the biggest loser and maybe those who have are prepared but I found Jillian's Marine Corps wanna-be ways extremely irritating.  She says things like \\"Isn't it Buddy, isn't?\\" to the demonstrators in a condescending way and she talks about pain as \\"fear leaving the body\\".  It's all so cliche and distracting from her true mission of good workout but 5 stars cause she does deliver on that!  Pros: I am not sure I believe just 20 mins a day of exercise can ever be enough but assuming you simply only could get 20 mins - she gives you a fairly complete, compact, varied 20 minutes.  I was already active when I started doing this DVD but still found it challenging.  She also explains the moves well and cautions you against no-nos that lead to injury.    I need her voice guidance to get the moves but may eventually feel ready to mute her out and listen to my own music.  Overall, great workout for the price and time commitment.
0307269752|1.0|Ok, sometimes I have luck with bestsellers and sometimes I don't. I forgot to bring a book to read for my flight and so got this book by Stieg Larsson at Hudson Books at the airport, where most of what they have in stock are \\"best-sellers.\\"<br /><br />I don't understand why this book is such a huge phenomenon.<br /><br />Firstly, I don''t care much for Larsson's writing style, which I find to be amateurish. Perhaps the translator is to blame here, but nonetheless, the outcome is very flat, with little depth. Larsson spends too much time -- almost half of the book -- giving an unnecessary and clich&eacute;d introduction to the characters before even getting to the plot of the story. And through all of this, the dialogue between characters is so painstakingly surficial.<br /><br />Secondly, all the characters are so predictable, even in their strengths and flaws. The protagonist, Mikael Blomkvist, is a financial journalist and co-founder of Millenium, an investigative-reporting magazine. At times, I got the sense that the author fantasized about being his lead character -- after all, Blomkvist is not only famous and successful, but a womanizer who seems to charm and bed every woman he meets. Women fall madly in love with him, finding him to be unlike every other man they've met, even their spouses. (Insert sigh and eye-roll here.) Being the picture of every man's fantasy in this unrealistic way, Blomkvist lacks depth as a character.<br /><br />Sharing the spotlight with Mikael in solving the mystery is Lisbeth Salander, after whom the book was titled. Predictably, she's portrayed to be the stereotype of a girl with tattoos -- she's an outcast, wears leather, has piercings, rides a motorcycle, and has issues with people. She's also hacker-smart, and has the ability to get into anyone's computer within a few seconds. For such an intelligent rebel, she allows herself to be sexually abused and raped in the book twice -- even though she eventually gets her revenge on her attacker. While reading these parts, I felt that the attacks were exploitive and even unneccessary. It also felt distant in emotion, and was obvious a man wrote it.<br /><br />The mystery of the story is as such: Henrik Vanger, a millionaire CEO of a family company, hires Blomkvist to solve the mystery of his beloved niece's sudden disappearance some 40 years ago, in the 60s. The solution is not a suprise or even a climax, and the lead-in to it is boring and slow. Also, on the track to solving the mystery, another one is solved, revealing a serial-killer of women (Henrik Vanger's nephew, brother to the missing niece) who hates women (apparently, this problem of misandry in Sweden was what the author wanted to make people aware of.)<br /><br />If anything, I find this book to exploit misandry more than bring awareness to it as a problem that's wrong in society. Despite Larsson's attempt to show that the heroine of the book is this \\"girl with the dragon tattoo,\\" I got the feeling that he got pleasure from writing about every aspect of man's upper hand on woman in his story, and that the form of a novel helped him disguise this. Just on pure plot, characters, and writing style alone, though, I would say that this book was a big disappointment.felt that the attacks were exploitive and even unneccessary.

B0036EH3WK|2.0|Having bought all the previous 5 seasons on Blu-ray (and payed over 200, almost 300usd) i am really not sure if its a good choice to pay almost the same money again to receive only a couple of Kids Menu items. I think not. Studios should consider giving discounts for previously purchased seasons. I have already paid for the royalties and other rights of the 5 seasons and paying an extra 150 usd (Complete BR set price minus 6th season BR price) for a fancy box which will occupy extra space on my movie rack is illogical. (2 stars goes for the product set, not the series)
B000VNMMR0|5.0|For me this was an exercise in excellent writing and that's always an important beginning.  Contrary to most belief in Hollywood, excellent scripts are needed for good movies.    As in the first Die Hard, the whole movie is about getting two people who have become estranged back together.  In the Die Hard they blew up a building to get Holly and John together. In this Die Hard they take down all the electronic systems (banks, electricity, etc) in order to get John together with his daughter - who hates her father so much she uses her mothers maiden name as her own last name.      The first Die Hard used that estrangement as the outcome of all the mayhem, the second Die Hard and third Die Hards had to do something else and they weren't nearly as good.... this one goes back to what worked the first time - even making references to the first movie that were hilarious then and remain hilarious now.  It's a fascinating continuum.    The other writing rule that this movie carries off spectacularly is: \\"What happens when your lead character can't grow?\\" John McClain is already as strong and tough and invincible as he can get.  So they bring in a character who can grow, who moves from utterly powerless geek to superhero under John's tutelage.  It's an interesting writing trick and I thought they did it well.    Some of the special effects were outrageous and it was hard to suspend disbelief even as it was hard not to enjoy them.  The villains were delightful.  The humor under the carnage is fun.  It was a good movie.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|THE most riveting book i have read in a VERY long time. Read the two previous books for maximum enjoyment.
0446615625|4.0|I always find Baldacci a bit over the top when it comes to writing plot and structure - his books are a lot like throwing noodles at a refrigerator and they all stick.  But I liked this book - unbelievable as much of it was - I liked the characters, I liked their fallibility in the face of very big villains.  It moved and I didn't get impatient with it as I often do.  I thought the bit at the end with Oliver Stone's daughter really weak and stupid.  But then I usually fault Baldacci for some unbelievable plotting.    This was a page turner.  If he'd ever figure out that he could still tell a good story with half the number of characters and a more straight lined plot he would be a great writer.  I think he's a great seller but I don't think he's a great writer.    However this book is worth buying.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|Why did the studio do this with Oprah, i'll never understand.  Planet Earth was done by one narrator and it was amazing.  Now this show comes out, and all of a sudden they get 2 different narrators.  Oprah is not horrible, but she is not suited for this type of work - don't ruin it for yourself, watch the British narrator, it's a pleasure to listen to him, you actually want to keep watching and learning all of the educational facts he provides you with.  Wish Oprah, I just felt like turning my tv off and going out and getting the other version.  I think they only did this to sell more since Oprah will talk about this on her show and there will be a bigger exposure to the American viewers.
B0007TKNII|4.0|There were many things that I liked about this film. The acting was very well done The directing, choreography, makeup, costume, etc., all added much to each and every scene. And the score (of course) was the familiar and extraordinary Phantom of the Opera score. Emmy Rossum's Christine was a jewel -- great acting, and sublime singing. Raoul, likewise, was perfect in his part (I really hated his hair in this role, but I digress :P). All of the supporting cast delivered stellar performances as well. So why...why...WHY did they cast Gerard Butler as the Phantom? At least, without having someone who can sing (!!) perform his songs? Perhaps in a limited scope, Butler's voice would be fine; but in the Phantom of the Opera, he was way out of his league. So, you find yourself deeply immersed in the movie ... until the bellowing Phantom starts to \\"sing\\".  To be fair, not every thing he sings is bellowed; but he managed to ruin every song in which he had a role with his frequent bellowing. Butler's singing is my main objection to this movie, and the reason it only gets 4 stars; his acting is great, and he makes a convincing Phantom (singing aside). Everyone else did a wonderful job, so this gets a 4/5

B000PC0S5K|5.0|Out of many books on spirituality and personal development, I have been touched by this idea of Life purpose which inspired you and transform your life.    I am understanding it this way, your life is empty vessel or simple medium and what makes it valuable is your inspired life purpose which is your message.     Think of your life as medium to express your creative self-express(who you are) which is your inspired unique voice and ultimate calling.    In my life journey  inspired-life-purpose site I have come to one conclusion that \\"Doing is knowing.\\" everything else is equal to not knowing.    I have gone through various life context other than my inspired life purpose which includes :    1. Money  2. Position  3. Relationship  4. Approval of others  5. False Security    none of this have provided me with ultimate leverage to fully express my self and expand my Joy, fullfillment, peace, abundence, inspiration and express my true genius.    Life purpose has created personal Breakthroughs in quality of my life areas and career.    I give 5 star to this book.    Ask yourself - Are you following the follower or living your Inspired Life Purpose, your true Path with a Heart?

B0039TD7RC|5.0|Without doubt this is the best rock and roll cd available today.  It is quintessential Stone's rock.  Tubling Dice, Sweet Virginia, and Shine a Light are unforgetable.  No wonder many of these songs are standard fare for Stone's concerts, even forty years from their inception. Exile is replete with songs that define the Rolling Stones as the longest standing rock and roll band in history and both the mood and tenor make it a timeless album. This 2010 re-release is rollicking good music, stunningly portrayed, which conveys the energy, enthusiasm, and pathos that has made Stone's music endearing for over four decades.  I am a true devotee of this band but as a reader if you are not familiar with the Rolling Stones buy this cd.  You will not be dissapointed and you will be in touch with the roots of modern rock and roll.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I originally saw this movie on the big screen.  I have long been a fan of any movie with Clint in it from his early career, to Dirty Harry and his later works - thrillers, comedy and romance.  I heard this was going to be his last movie since he is getting on in years.  This was a remarkable tale of a man's life and consequences of decisions he made and must make.  It was humorous and touching at the same time.  I love his toughness hiding the soft character just beneath.  I can watch this movie again and again, catching an new angle I hadn't seen before. Truly a magnificent work!

030745455X|4.0|After reading :The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", I really had no desire to continue with the saga.  I liked it, but there were too many characters, too much going on, and I couldn't really relate to or get deeply involved with any of the characters.  They seemed too distant for me.  For some reason, however, I sent for \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\". Now, I have to admit, I've ordered the third book, also.  I am now a convert and loved it.  I couldn't wait to pick it up to find out what happened next, finally got involved with Salander, and was able to deal with the strange relationships in Blumqvest's life.  For an American who is unfamiliar with Sweden, some of the details about the towns or shops is a bit tedious, but the story itself is wonderful, fast paced, and attention grabbing.  Can't wait until the next book arrives.
0446364495|3.0|Wow, I tend to agree with the other reviewer that people who are so extreamly harsh with their reviews must be terribly miserable people with perhaps, seriously unhappy lives, void of satisfying love or the ability to feel romance.      I am a reader of non-fiction history and never read a romance novel so I do not know anything about their content, but I chose to read this book after seeing the movie and found it a bit \\"poetic\\", but refreshing and I certainly didn't have the need to \\"throw it against the wall\\".  Wow, what a reaction!     Sometimes you need a \\"walk down the lane of love\\" that apparently, few people never experience.  Yes, middle age passion can happen, whether it does as passiontly as in this book, who knows.  But it is a refreshing to read.  So, lighten up and make a date with romance and enjoy the book for what it is. The sequel is an interesting trip too, a bit over-kill, but interesting.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I have never seen a show that had so much character development.  Usually you find one or two characters that you like, but with great casting and wonderful insight into so many of the people on this show, I loved 99% of them.  In this day and age most of the shows are just action or attempts at surprises, LOST managed to pull this off as well as give us so many meaningful characters that we loved to see every week. Even though all the mysteries were not resolved, the creators showed us that it was the people, not the island that matter the most. The Jack/Sawyer hug at the end was the best part for me. Showing that anything is possible...enemies can become allies for eternity. Now that LOST is over, there will be a big void in my TV viewing and in my heart.

B0000E6XH3|5.0|Que más puede pedirse la supervisión visual de Leigi Matsumoto (Queen Emeraldas, Cap. Harlook) con el excelente sonido de Daft Punk. Encontramos la historia de cuatro personajes que han sido secuestrados de su planeta y llevados a la tierra para explotar su talento a toda costa, sin importar nada en el camino, en una historia que se va desarrollando poco a poco, sin dialogos, en donde unicamente la música y la imagen son suficientes para narrar la historia.  Recomendado para todos aquellos que les guste la musica electrónica y de paso los Animés japoneses.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This production is absolutely perfect - both my marginally interested husband and 10-year old daughter were drawn in entirely.    Jennifer Ehle is mesmerizing as Elizabeth - you literally cannot take your eyes off of her in any scene - and Colin Firth is brilliant as Mr. Darcy, whose every subtle gesture is an absolutely perfect puzzle to Elizabeth (is it indignant brooding, judgment and disapproval - or just the painful awkwardness of a man smitten?).     The director has been as true to the text as a reader could wish, but has taken some forgivable liberties toward the end with the Lydia/Wickham story in order to meet the creative challenge posed by so much storytelling-through-letters near the end of the book.  The dialogue is sparkling, the scenery, costumes and tiny details are genius (the wordless Mr. Hurst forever passed out in a drunken stupor, Lydia playing with the epaulets on a soldier's uniform, inflection adjusted as servants creep in the background), and the performance of David Bamber as Mr. Collins is beyond comical; his effeminate gestures and endess gushing read volumes into the devil's bargain made by Charlotte in marrying him. Barbara Leigh-Hunt is an amazing Lady Catherine - her performance satisfies in every way.     There is no greater reward (for this female viewer at least) than arriving at Pemberley and finally seeing the expression of abject, unconcealed and unmistakable love on Mr. Darcy's face as he hears Elizabeth singing. UNFORGETTABLE, to die for.
B000HL09MG|1.0|Boring, agonizingly slow, annoying repetitions of dialogue, and the sex scenes are enough to make one strongly consider celibacy.  Also, rather unrealistic-- a doctor with a fabulous condo overlooking Central Park West, a Range Rover, extensive art collection, and high end office and he only has 2 patients scheduled in an afternoon?  Must be some kind of expensive house calls he makes.  See this movie if you enjoy having a root canal.
B003BZXHX8|5.0|Great, enjoyable, entertaining \\"Barbra\\". She was as \\"everyday human\\" as possible in this small and \\"hot\\" nightclub setting. She was not perfect as her albums/CD's always sound, just very real.Her song selections can easily bring tears to your eyes. After greater than an hour without a break, there was obvious fatigue at the end of her performance, but after 47 years, we all get a little tired! I recommend this to all \\"Barbra\\" fans.
1400052173|5.0|Although, the writing style leaves a lot to be desired. I must give praise to Rebecca Skloot for having the courage to write about this story. It's a wonderful and tragic tale about a family's insatiable desire to discover all they can about a mother died too soon, only to later find out she has become the origin of 95% of the worlds' Medical/Technological discoveries of the last 60 years. It's also another link in the chain of America's long history of exploitation of people of color. This book/story shines a light on the darkness of that exploitation medical, economic, legal , political & otherwise. I know most Americans don't like the word \\"reparations\\". But think about the thousands of experiences of people of color in this country that hasn't been brought out in the open. In South Africa, they at least had a truth commission. I would hope that stories like this one would foster greater understanding from the larger society about what has been done without folks harboring resentment for feeling or not feeling guilty about our shared history.  I know that's idealistic. But people need to know that there is a correlation between mistreatment of people of color in the past and whole host of problems in the minority communities today. We as a nation cannot move past something until we deal with all problems that exist because of it. Open wounds need to be treated and healed, before we can be declared healthy! If for nothing else buy this book so the proceeds can continue to educate Mrs. Lacks descendants!
1400095204|4.0|A friend lent me this book, and once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  The plot circles around the Biafran War, a civil war in Nigeria.  But even more, the plot circles around a set of compelling and complex characters.  What is especially interesting is the points of view that Adichie chooses to tell the story through: a daughter of wealthy Nigerians, her \\"houseboy\\", and a white writer trying to write about Nigerian art and culture.  I'm now reading another of this author's books set in Nigeria -- Purple Hibiscus.  And I'll definitely look for her other books once I'm done this one.  --Michelle
0061122092|3.0|Interesting at times but overall not as good as I had hoped.

A so-so read but overall under developed characters and reasons for what they do and why.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Why have you not seen this movie? It only made like a trillion dollars at the box office. Maybe i'm exagerating a little. I just wanted to give you a ball park figure. I thought it would be impossible for this movie to live up to all the hype but it does. This is a movie you and the kids can watch. Once you get pass the fact that they look like a bunch of blue monkeys running around, this movie is pretty good. The story is definately not original but what they lack in originality they make up for with there creativity. What's it about? It's the same old story. White people trying to take stuff that's not theres,THE END. Just kidding. That's part of it but this movie is about alot more. The story will intrigue you and the graphics will amaze you. People are buying blu ray dvd players just to watch this movie. It's worth it. I'm giving this movie 2 BIG BIG THUMBS UP! I got like three copies. You wanna buy one? Sike, not for sale. HOLLA

B001UV4XWY|3.0|This is a really strange movie from the opening shot. It is filled with strange scenes and characters. Like Cameron Diaz's disfigured foot. The whole movie just feels like it has a horror movie vibe while focusing on a drama type narrative. It is set in the 70's for some reason. Based on the plot it  would have made more sense to have it in the present time. There is a fair share of cheesy moments sprinkled throughout the movie. I don't really know why these scenes couldn't have been cut, because they really hurt the pacing of the movie. You know what else hurt the pacing? The two hour run time. It just seemed to drag on and on. At the end of the film when the plot is finally finished it does leave you with an intriguing question. Did they pass the test? I would have liked it if the overall plot of the box maker was finished. They sort of just leave you with the end of the test and not the end of the experiment. The acting in the movie is decent but always feels like the lines are cheesy and a little to much like they are in a 70's family comedy. Outside the dialogue of the main characters Mr Steward is creepy throughout the film, and adds most of the intrigue to the plot. As the credits roll you are left with some interesting ideas to mull over as you ask yourself what you would do in the given situation. Overall the movie is decent it just suffers from pacing and dialogue issues. The story as an overall arc is full of depth due to the length of the film even though some of the movie was clearly filler, it is an enjoyable ride as you try and guess what is going on. I recommend it to fans of anthology series like the Twilight Zone or the Outer Limits.

0439023483|2.0|As each chapter of \\"The Hunger Games\\" ended, I felt no eager anticipation to know what would happen next in the story. It all felt so contrived, unbelievable and dark, and trudging the strange writing style only added to uneasy feeling I experienced while reading the book. I know many young people who rave about the story. Perhaps, it is aimed for a younger crowd - like artificially-flavored fruit snacks.
B002PQ7JME|1.0|I had high expectations for the Mazzy Star reissues on vinyl, unfortunately the pressing is terrible.  I thought I just got a lemon, but even the replacement was bad.  The first song (and my favorite Mazzy Star song) had several skips and there are pops throughout the entire record.  And it's not just She Hangs Brightly, my copy of So Tonight That I Might See has similiar issues.  I've never had problems with records on the Plain label before, but they missed the mark on these reissues.

0307454541|2.0|I enjoy reading mystery books but must say, this one was barely worth the time. Only the story kept me reading.  The characters, the writing style, and descriptions of place and time were very dry,tedious, and uninvolving.  Compared to authors such as Connelly, Coben, Crais and the like, this book is a big step down.  I am dumbfounded as to why is is a blockbuster.  I kept waiting for it to get better.  I have little interest in reading the rest of the series. What a letdown.
B003JYOEYM|3.0|I recently watched Survival of the Dead and thought it was neither terrible nor amazing.  While it definitely isn't on par with his other films, Romero has still crafted a solid zombie film with Survival of the Dead.  The story is decent and the climax is filled with gory zombie action.  My chief complaints with the film are that for whatever reason you never get the sense that claustrophobic sense that you are surrounded by zombies like in other Romero films and the use of CGI is not very strong.  Romero would have been better off saving the money spent on the CGI to pay for good makeup effects and fill the screen with many more zombies.
B00014NE62|5.0|There's not much more to say about the excellence and sensitivity with which James Ivory brought Forster's posthumous-published autobiographical novel to fruition on screen. Merchant/Ivory films aren't known for action, rather sincere and severe character study. A gay male in Edwardian England was subject to excruciating horrors and humiliation; class was more important than anything. At the advent of DVD, I sold my VHS and waited for this 2-disc DVD, rife with extras and insight. When the film was first released, it won awards for James Wilby and Hugh Grant at both Venice and Cannes. This was the advent of Grant's career, and it seems he wasn't stigmatized by his choice of roles.Rupert Graves also gives fine insight into the development of his character, though he insists (maybe too much) that he's straight. ALL of the acting is pitch-perfect, perhaps one of the best ensemble casts I've seen; Denholm Elliott, Simon Callow, Billie Whitelaw, Judy Parfitt, Helena Mitchell, Ben Kingsley. All excellent. I was particularly taken by the brief appearance of Mark Tandy as Risley. He is actually the catalyst that drives Maurice to meet Clive. His subsequent situation creates great amounts of angst for all involved. If you're reading this, you probably know all this. I simply can't say how much I like this film. I was not a fan of \\"Room With a View\\" so this Merchant/Ivory film was a total delight, and the 3rd in the trilogy, \\"Howard's End\\" was excellent, too. Also, a happy ending to a frustrating and fearsome gay story in Edwardian England. I think it's Forster's wish for humankind. Food for thought, and hope...
0451196716|2.0|The book itself is not a typical Stephen King horror book. It is more like a bad 80s slasher movie, which deals with a bunch of kids on some kind of a road race where losers are killed. I must admit that though I did not quite find it thrilling, once I had started reading it I wanted to know what it was really all about and how it would all end. Needless to say, I was angrily disappointed with the ending. There are much better Stephen King's novels out there, and this is certainly not one of the best. I do not find it to be even a good novel.

B002JVWQUA|5.0|Flashforward was the show to replace LOST. The networks promoted it as such and some of us even believed it could be as good as the television greatness benchmark. I never thought that it would replace LOST, but I had hoped it would fill the void after LOST went into the great beyond. The show from the start was disappointing. It was never bad just not up to the level of greatness that ABC had promoted it as. The story took a little long to develope and the characters themselves lacked depth for far too long. As the show reached it's hiatus though the stories and characters really kicked into gear. The plot twists we expected from the show finally started to appear. As the show entered hiatus it was really on a roll, and when it came back four months later it really amped up the action with amazing episodes. Some of the stories in the show never really interested me. Like Aaron and his dead daughter. It always seemed seperated from the central mythos and Aaron and Tracy themselves always seemed like they should have been left on the cutting room floor. Thankfully this deadly duo didn't recieve alot of screen time throughout the series and I was greatful. The actors themselves did a great job. They never missed a beat. Dominic Monoughan joining the cast after a few episodes was a welcome treat and was the real start of the story picking up.<br /><br />When Simon is introduced to the plot another side of the story is revealed. You finally start to see who was behind the blackout, but never to my satisfaction do you find out why they did it. There were some clues that Mark obtained that never seemed to pan out to real revelations, but I can assume that they would have been important to the plot had the show continued. The love triangle between Mark, Olivia, and Lloyd is very well done. Mark is the main character and he has to choose between saving the world and saving his marriage. Olivia Mark's wife sees herself with Lloyd in her flashforward. Though she is loyal to her husband it soon becomes apparent that the universe has other things in store. Mark has to try and maintain his life at home while trying to unravel the mysteries behind the global blackout. It adds a great depth and vulnerability to the protagonist. Another interesting plot is Mark's partner Domitri who saw nothing when he blacked out. He soon finds out that if you saw no future you will be dead by April 29th. It's really cool to see how this character deals with his mortality. The main plot and question to the series is the most interesting. Can the future be changed? How these characters fight the future or make sure it comes true is an interesting window into how these characters think and feel about their lives and who they really are.<br /><br />The show in the first few episodes was centered more on the overall plot of the blackout and less on the characters and their development. After a few episodes though they complimented themselves nicely and I started to really care about these people. As the series continued it added more character centric episodes that explained each character through flashbacks of their time before the blackout, or during it. This really helped the series to delve into what makes these characters tick and the series was way better for it. The show does have a sci fi element to it, but that shouldn't scare anyone away from this astounding series. The characters themselves root the plot in reality as they struggle to fight the future. A bit of a warning to those that buy this series on DVD or Blu Ray the show does not have a tidy ending. The final episode was shot as a season finale so there is a cliffhangar. It's nothing too serious and you can create your own ending based on what you learn, but it sure does leave you begging for more. This series ultimatly failed to capture the imagination of the audience and that is a shame. It may have been chosen as the sucessor to LOST, but what can really live up to that hype. Flashforward turned into one of the more enjoyable series this year, but unfortunatly there was no one left watching to experience it. I recommend it to fans of the serialized dramas like LOST or Fringe as it is a unique story thats worth the money.f the more enjoyable series this year, but unfortunatly there was no one left watching to experience it.

1423113381|5.0|Why exactly I picked out this book?<br />I am a fan of the mythology genre, and Egyptology genre. So this happens to be one of those BINGO moments I just have to get my hands on. Plus Rick Riordan is quite a writer.<br /><br />My Thoughts '''''<br />This is quite a book! Rick Riordan didn't disappoint me at all in this. Great set of new characters heading on a new set of adventure. Main characters, Carter and Sadie enter an unexpected life as soon as they witnessed their father released the main 5 Egyptian Gods. Now, they are set to stop Set (Seth.. Yes, Rick wrote him as Set!!) and found out they are hosting Horus and Isis themselves. Trying to control their lives as they try to save their father from Set's clutches, between fighting demons and the two Gods within them, as well as not trying to be power crazy, I say their adventures are quite a trip to read.<br /><br />Expect Rick Riordan's special humor in this one as well.<br /><br />P/S if you like Lemony Snicket books, this would be awesome read for you.<br /><br />Librarian Muse<br />It's a great book, but as a librarian, I am kinda reluctant to place this in my school library without any request. Why? The indepths are to distracting regardless interesting and educating. It slowed down the storyline and dampens the fast moving adventures. Otherwise, if Egyptology is an interest to a the students, the would enjoy it thoroughly.

0805091742|4.0|Most surgeons know Atul Gawande from his previous bestsellers Complications and Better. This much awaited The Checklist Manifesto surely adds something to the philosophy of medicine, for which this Author is famous. Basically, illustrating a change of mentality that is going on in medical practices, that always more often in a complex reality, are adopting the checklist approach typical of aviation security measures, Gawande's short book introduces us to the basis, the application and the results of medical checklists enforced in the operating room scenario. This book is a must read for all doctors, but has the cards also to interest the layman that finally gets to understand the complex medical problems going on in medical structures. Gawande as an opinion maker makes his point once more.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Cloverfield is a terrible movie annoying and liable to make you dizzy thanks to someone's \\"bright\\" idea of moving the camera around. it's like blair witch yet worst(how that's possible I don't know).the movie is just a rip off of godzilla and plays off end of the world fears.I have seen B-movies ten times better than this.
B0039TD7PY|1.0|Like several other reviewers (and I am TRULY amazed there are not many more of them here), while the material here is classic, that leaves the sound quality and sadly, I find this recording almost unbearable to listen to.  And no, I'm NOT a 'sonic snob' or 'expert audiophile,' or anything of the like.  Fortunately, I DO possess good hearing, excellent audio equipment and happen to own over 8,000 CDs - many of which are live recordings and remasters of concerts from many DECADES ago - not only three years ago in 2007!  It's not asking a lot to expect the sound technicians and engineers to do their job right and for the final release to sound terrific, but with this release, the exceptionally poor job that Peter Asher and Nathaniel Kunkel (!) did with the sound and audio engineering is an audio nightmare. I don't even know how this was released to the general public. For an example of what I'm talking about, the first few Led Zeppelin albums came out in 1969 and 1970, they're not even live, and with the final remasters, they all sound like they were recorded last month.  Which is what this terrific reunion SHOULD have sounded like.<br /><br />These phenomenal songs speak for themselves, and this should have been a superb recording of an excellent concert between two troubadours playing at their namesake.  However, throughout the entire recording, there's virtually NO clarity, spaciousness or separation between the instruments, vocals and applause.  So, if you're listening for sentimental value (and granted, there's a lot of it here among these excellent songs), and can equalize the sound to approximate something that's listenable, by all means, go for it.<br /><br />I am hoping along with many others, I'm sure, with the next pressing and remastering of this recording (hopefully as soon as possible), the remarkably poor sonic issues will be corrected and ideally, an exchange be given for the original. Only then will all of Carole and James' fans have a lasting CD audio keepsake of a concert that sounds as great as their pairing at the Troubadour truly must have been.oncert that sounds as great as their pairing at the Troubadour truly must have been.

I know were not used to this type of film with Stallone but I thought he pulled it off.

And While I despise Fords I thought the movie was cool and decent.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Obviously, it was really built up with hype and surrounded by the mystery of the monster and the plot of the film before it's actual theatrical release. Cloverfield is entertaining, and as far as critics say, that's really all this movie is meant for.    However, I really like owning it because I think it's a great thriller and very fascinating to delv into the extras and story background. The technology used to make the film is nothing less than amazing and it's really inexpensive on Amazon so it's worth having at home on DVD.

0307454541|5.0|When I was thinking of reviewing this novel I was teetering towards 4 or 4 1/2 stars, but upon re-reading it once again I can safely say it's one hell of an absorbing mystery.  A lot of press and speculation has been surrounded by this book and most definitely from it's author.  His sudden death after completing the three manuscripts that make up \\"the girl\\" series is thrilling in it's own right.  Although it's believed he died from natural causes many speculate he was killed by members in the Swedish government.  In any case he left behind three novels that are not only taking America, but the world by storm.  The first novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo introduces us to Lisbeth Salander who if this novel continues to be the popular phenomenon that it is could reach the status as the next Jason Borne or Double 007.  In many respects I found her to be superior to these two men because she is both a woman and has the intellectual capacity to recognize her sex and use the advantages that come with it.  This book however is not all about Lisbeth, but features complex and interesting characters like Mikael Blomkvist coffee drinking reporter by day and mystery solver by night.  What I like the best about this novel is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.  The subject matter and the plot are both strong, but I think Larson plays with  the construction of a mystery novel.  Each characters from the main to the supporting all are interesting and fleshed out.  While the ending went into campy and over the top violence it all added to the complexity and the overall strength of the novel.  I was never a big fan of the mystery genre, but reading this novel cracked the deeply problematic cliches that have played the genre fro years.  Larson breathes new life into the genre.  The action never lets up, the suspense never slackens, and the reader anxiously eats all of it up.  A thoroughly superior mystery story!
1400031001|3.0|This is a fine novel, and I admit that I enjoyed reading it, but it would've been a great novel if only . . .<br /><br />IF ONLY he hadn't included all those detailed accounts of vacuous cocktail parties and gatherings where numerous names (most authentic, some fictitious ) are dropped with a report of how much each one drank. If only he hadn't kept a running tally of what the protagonist drank each day and how much. I suppose that the name-dropping makes the diary more realistic, but like the nonfiction [[ASIN:B001O2JDHE Diary of H.L. Mencken]], it makes for tedious reading.  Most of the famous names he introduces are dragged onstage to utter a single line, then shuffled off. If only he had dispensed with the once-conventional device of mentioning each time someone lights a cigarette.<br /><br />Without such chaff, \\"Any Human Heart\\" would be a much better novel, and it would be about 200 pages shorter.<br /><br />(Now I suppose that some schmarty-pantz will list a dozen other novels with an index, but there are so many names here that this book really needs one.)<br /><br />There seems to be something about British authors which apparently makes them resist deleting anything from their manuscripts. They have lost all ability to be succinct, and they must regard the deletion of a single sentence as an affront to their personal honour or an indignity, as if someone had failed to stand for God Save the Queen.

0553582038|3.0|I loved this series so much in the beginning but this book is, dare I say, boring.  The author has taken away most of the reason I loved the series and filled it with a lot of characters I just dont care about and he he spends a lot of time on those characters.      If boiled down to the part where the plot actually developes and characters we actually care about are featured, the book would be reduced by two thirds.

B002776NS2|5.0|Haunting melodies that enhance the chants, the feeling expressed IN the chants and the combination of synthesizer and electronica MAKE this collection special.    Yes, it's \\"relaxation\\" music by definition, but it's far from being just something for the background.  You end up actively listening, hearing and feeling the music and chants.      This will go on my iPod immediately, in its entirety.

B002KSPKRS|3.0|The Good    **Every thing you need to get started is included in the package. A USB power cable, optical audio cable, and 2 AAA batteries are included in the package. It seems that almost every electronic device you buy needs a special cable or attachment that has to be purchased separately, so it's always nice when a device has everything you need included.    The 5.1 surround sound works pretty well. Though obviously not as good as physical surround sound set up, you will be able to tell what direction different audio cues are coming from (footsteps, gun fire, voices, etc.) The real standout feature here is the dynamic chat volume. The X41s allow you to adjust the volume of game audio and voice chat independently, but will also automatically increase or decrease the voice chat volume so that it is always slightly louder than the game audio. A nice touch for fans of online shooters.    The Bad   The X41s look and feel cheap. From the very first time you pick them up, you will feel that you need to handle them with care. The ear cups jiggle and rattle every time you pick the headset up and the white molded plastic makes them look and feel like a toy. People with small children beware.     The Ugly    Audio quality is suspect. Some mid-range sounds on the X41s can sound as if you were listening to them through a tin can on a string. It's not very noticeable, and most enclosed speaker headsets have this problem, but when combined with the audio pops, you can't ignore the quality issue here.    All in all, They aren't bad headsets. They work well with xbox live voice chat and they're pretty comfortable. The x41s could be the perfect gaming solution if they were $100 or less, but they're not. So, I can only recommend them if you want a gaming headset specifically designed for use with xbox live. However, if your primary concern is getting the full enjoyment out of your games without disturbing your spouse or roommates, you might want to pass. There are better less expensive options.    **If you use an HDMI cable to connect your 360 to your television, then you will need to plug the optical cable into your televisions optical out port or an optical out on your stereo receiver.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|If a book keeps you up half the night because you cannot put it down, it is by definition a pretty good book. However when the desire to finish is accompanied by some melancholy that the end is in sight, you are reading something amazing.<br /><br />Such is the case with The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. If the first two novels in the trilogy [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)]] and [[ASIN:030745455X The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage)]] were nearly perfect, perfection has been achieved. This is a book to celebrate, and to appreciate Larrson's deft hand as he explores many aspects of misogyny. While this trilogy will thrill you, and keep you up late, it will also make you think.<br /><br />To those few readers of the first two volumes who did not immediately buy this final book when it became available, rest assured that all of the loose ends are tied up (as are some of the characters), and in a thoroughly fascinating manner. It is however the courtroom scenes in which Larrsen displays true mastery. One audacious criminal plan collides with a equally creative law enforcement plan and the resulting fireworks are a thing of beauty.<br /><br />To those new readers for contemplating starting with this last novel, don't. Unlike the situation for those of us who discovered The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo when it was first published, you do not have to wait for each new volume. You can read them all at one time. Be prepared for many nights of little or no sleep, and a final sense of dismay that there will be no volume four.

B0037A4ILC|5.0|4.6 stars<br /><br />It's a pleasure to watch a film that covers all the dramatic bases well. Nordwand starts pleasantly, introducing the characters one by one with subtle details that say volumes but with little effort. We get to know the people, and then the adventure begins. I could really feel for these guys, and for once the love story didn't seem tacked on; it plays out like an integral part of the movie.<br /><br />In fact, the best performance here might be from Johana Wokalek, excellent as the young photographer---you can believe the love she portrays. But everyone is solid, and my only qualm might be that the last 30 minutes stretch a little too long, with too many tense close-ups etc. Still, the tension is real and I felt like I was there; the music is perfect, the sound of the snow and wind quite visceral, and I felt cold while watching this on a hot Texas night. That's good filmmaking.<br /><br />It helped a lot that I didn't know the story ahead of time; if you also don't, just watch the film before learning more. I was suitably surprised by what happens and never felt manipulated as in many films of this type. The climbing scenes are magnificent, perhaps the best I've ever seen, and you come away with huge respect for these early climbers and what they did with such basic equipment.<br /><br />All in all, a gripping adventure recommended to fans of mountains, man vs. nature adventures, and even those who enjoy a low-key love story.<br /><br />One quibble: I speak German and the subtitles are miles off in many parts, not even beginning to convey the subtlety of what these characters are saying at points. Imagine hearing \\"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,\\" while reading, \\"It doesn't matter.\\" If you're going to spend this much on a movie, make the subtitles perfect! Bitte...

B00064WSN2|4.0|After my first listen, I was inclined to give this cd 4/5 as a solid, pleasant enough listen. On my second listen, I wasn't feeling so generous. It's a pity that this site does't allow for half stars...3.5/5 is a fair score for it, I think.      The tracks, in album order:      Peace - a beginning  -  0:50 minutes long. Starts off with a very feint male vocal, and it gets a little bit louder later on. You hear some strings being plucked at the end of the track.    Pictures of a city - 8:01. Has a sort of spy movie soundtrack vibe to it...brassy and bassy. Then you get short, rhymey vocals. There's a quiet part with the drums being the dominant sound. Jazzy, bluesy, jam-rock style at times.     Cadence and cascade - 4:37. Genteel and delicate track. Acoustic guitar notes on the left hand side. Breathy, gentle vocals. Flute, jazzy percussion on the cymbals. Piano. Pleasant track.    In the wake of Poseidon - 7:56. Acoustic guitar on the left hand side then you hear an organ on the right hand side. Drumming is stronger and busy. Plaintive vocals, violins, horn, bass. Not sure if this song has an environmental theme. Crucifixion is mentioned.     Peace - theme  -  1:15.  Acoustic guitar instrumental. Gentle track with notes plucked and strumming.    Cat food - 4:52. Jazzy track, especially with the raggedy piano. Bass, strong drumming. Has 1950s style Chuck Berry lead guitar work. I think that the song has sexual innuendo at times too.    The devil's triangle - 11:37. Instrumental. Listed as having 3 parts on the sleeve. If I've got the breakdown right, the first part starts off with silence then very feint sounds appear. There is a drums of war vibe, violins and keyboard. Second part (?) has stronger drumming. The third part (?) is experimental,, busy and rowdy. A harpsichord or some such is utilised. Samples some of the title track from their debut album. The Beatles' classic \\"A day in the life\\" is brought to mind with this song. Discordantly jazzy at times too.Peace - an end  -  2:53. The time displayed for this track is a might disorientating. It ends with a minute remaining on the lcd display. You get a gentle voice at first, then gentle acoustic guitar. You hear two male voices at times.        Bonus tracks:      Cat food (single version) - 3:48. Starts 2:47...part of the weird track separation I mentioned for the previous song.     Groon (single, B side) - 3:31. Instrumental. Jazzy...bassy, electric guitar. Drum has a good tone to it and the drumming is interesting and varied...cymbals get used too. A good track for those who like the drums.        Recommendations:      King Crimson - In the court of the Crimson King    Genesis - From Genesis to Revelation    Frank Zappa and The mothers of invention - Freak out!
0800141601|3.0|still with the American accent! The bad guys, especially in the \\"black castle\\" rescue scenes, make one think of a sci-fi/ darthvader rehash.  Too bad, because Sean Connery and Julia Ormond have a believable chemistry and they keep soldiering on,in spite of the script. They almost pull the film off.      In the end, the movie is so uneven that all the references to Camelot, Roundtable and Excaliber just made me think of other, better films on the subject. I suggest The Mists of Avalon, or Excaliber (with a young Helen Miren doing quite unlikely stuff, beautifully!) Both movies are more respectful of your imagination and intelligence than is First Knight.
B002TZS5GU|4.0|I rented this under the impression that it was a zombie horror film. It is and it isn't. It has a few \\"zombie movie\\" cliches - but for the most part, this is a really decent post-apocalyptic drama with a young cast lead respectably by Chris Pine and Lou Taylor Pucci. Those two play brothers who are driving a car (and stealing gas, etc.) to get to a beach where they think it'll be safe after some kind of terrible virus has swept out the world. I was mostly impressed with the acting (Pine especially is memorable) and the mood the film creates. I'd recommend to people who like drama with a bit of suspense thrown in. For horror fans, you could be disappointed unless you're in the mood for something quieter with less gore. This is also reasonably priced!

B0039TD7RC|3.0|The album is a Stones classic and gets 5 stars for the music.  I rated it lower because, once again, Mick and Keith are trying to rewrite history.  First they did it with the recent Rarities album by cropping the cover photo to eliminate Bill Wyman.  Now they're at it again, but this time with one of the best rock 'n' roll albums ever. Like the Soviets used to purge any mention or images of Leon Trotsky from their history books, Mick and Keith are rewriting the history of the Stones by eliminating all photos of Mick Taylor and Bill Wyman from Exile's new packaging.   The new booklet has NO photos of Wyman (He never existed!)and there are two photos of Taylor, but photos were carefully chosen so that he is unidentifiable (He is in the shadows or his back is to the camera).  This is pretty petty stuff and the Stones fans deserve better. This Glimmer Twins revisionism needs to stop before they move on to their next projects, Sticky Fingers and Some Girls.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|After you dismiss all the superficial reviews for the movie as \\"I bought this for my granddaughter\\", \\"It came in a package that was only slightly chewed\\", \\"Blu-ray is the greatest, just look at all those pixels,\\" \\"The producers hate America\\", \\"See the corporations are just money grubbers.\\" and so forth, You can get down to why you buy movies and specifically this one as plot and presentation.<br /><br />Basic story is that we found a new planet with a valuable mineral. We want that mineral at any cost. Therefore, we attempt communication and barter, if that does not work for some reason then it is coercion and displacement. One misplaced person  is stuck in the middle of the decision and is torn between two ways of life and loyalty. Will his actions actually affect either way of life or is he just a pawn?<br /><br />Now I know I have seen this whole movie before in animation but cannot seem to locate it. I was surprised and more so. Because it is one thing to follow a formula but another to downright copy another movie. There was no body substitution in the animated film. Yet that was the only real addition.<br /><br />O.K. for the techocentric I only saw the Blu-ray 2D version. I think it was the 46\\" screen that made the impressive presentation. It almost looked 3D. In addition, the sound was all you would expect it to be.<br /><br />For people that come to think of the DVD extras or Bonus as a relevant part of the package. Moreover, many times it is. You will be disappointed with the version I watched, as there was only a screen/bookmark section.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|I'm not gonna waste my time enumerating all the reasons why Lost turned out to be the biggest crock of **** in the history of motion pictures. They stringed us along all this time to throw a Jacob's Ladder ending in our faces. By a Jacob's Ladder ending, I DON'T mean to say that the Losties all turned out to be dead; it's obvious that they weren't. They all just met later on in some afterlife (really lame, I know, but that's what happened). By Jacob's Ladder, I mean an ending that's in some ways moot, and doesn't have the kind of significance you were led to believe it would. I don't particularly mind an ending like that in some cases, but it was WRONG for a show like Lost. I would like to be clear about something: I am not complaining about the creators' failure to \\"reveal everything.\\" I wouldn't presume to expect that kind of gratification from any form of art or entertainment. What I am offended by, is the sheer brazen irresponsibleness of the creators, introducing countless mysteries, puzzles, and items of supposed monumental portent which, for the most part, they obviously never intended to solve, explain, or redeem since they clearly had no idea what the answers and meanings were in the first place.  I will concede that some answers were provided, and yes, in a lame way they made sense, but the problem is that they were just THAT: LAME.<br /><br />I had watched Lost with a growing sense of wonder and delight. I was foolish enough to believe that the creators had a predesigned plan. I was wrong, and am still kind of heartbroken.<br /><br />A travesty in every sense of the word.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.
0142001104|5.0|The walls of negative perception melt away as you read the book.  Roz and Ben Zander are great teachers of perception and the power that changing your perception can positively alter your experience and contribution to the world.  Having read this book I feel like I have been given a construct and tool set to truly affect my life and the lives I come in contact with in a much richer way.  I am a 40 something 7 year divorced guy with 3 kids and I run a couple companies, so life can be demanding to say the least and I have to admit, I get caught in downward spirals.  The Zanders' philosophies allow you to make it out of that downward and negative current that we all can get caught in and swim in the direction you want.  Already putting it to practice.    Great read.  Highly recommend.
B003MLBYRM|5.0|First, let me cut to the chase:    If you are one of those people who got their introduction to this series through the \\"New\\" series and thought it was THE BEST thing ever...skip this review. AND skip buying this season. You will NOT like it!    HOWEVER...if you cut your teeth on this series, starting with the \\"old\\" (now referred to as the \\"Classic\\" series) - and the FURTHER back, the better - and lamented over the \\"new and improved\\" resurrected series as being...well...if you just lamented over it...REJOICE! You will LOVE the 5th season (and the new Doctor/Matt Smith).    First, I want to say that I never got to see Eccelston enough to form an objective opinion of \\"his\\" Doctor. It was just sort of, \\"Yeah - eh, ok...he's \\"there.\\" Fine\\" And I DID love Tennant. What I DIDN'T like, were his companions. Which means that the episodes I liked best, were the ones where he didn't have a companion. (And, interestingly enough, the one I remember BEST, was \\"Blink\\" - where the \\"Weeping Angels\\" were first introduced.    Now...I had a promo code from Amazon to use, and while I started out to just use it to get 1 or 2 episodes for \\"free,\\" I ended up (by accident) buying the whole season with a TV pass. What with one thing and another, I never got the chance to actually sit down and watch any of them, until now. Anticipating a 3-day weekend, I expected to watch 1 or 2 each night, over a 3-night period.    Well...THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN! Once I sat down (today) and started watching...I just COULDN'T quit watching. Every time the box came up, asking if I wanted to watch the next episode, I just HAD to click YES! So I've just spent several hours straight, watching this (and I can say, still, I haven't seen several hours out of the first 4 seasons, total, yet!)    I'm sure the \\"politically correct police\\" will come for me...and I would like to know when this word became a \\"four-letter\\" word...but what I ENJOYED MOST about this - from FIRST to SIXTH episode...was that they were FUN!!!!    THIS is what I remembered liking about the \\"classic\\" series. There is a lot (a LOT!) of dashing to and fro - insanity - madness - adventure - and just plain good FUN! (Oh, yeah - and saving the Earth isn't a \\"shabby\\" deal, either!) Amy Pond (new/current companion) reminds me of Ace (which I consider a MAJOR improvement over the previous companions - so, if you DIDN'T like Ace, you may want to keep THAT in mind, too.)    I remember the controversy when Matt Smith was chosen. Bothering to look up what little I could find about him (including an interview), I decided that, \\"This could turn out very bad (another \\"fifth season\\" that I wouldn't be watching)...OR...very good (fingers crossed, hoping against hoping).\\" I was wrong...this turned out GREAT!!! :-DDD    The Eleventh Hour - sees the new Doctor adjusting to a new personality (as well as a new body). I love the scenes with poor Amy Pond (as a child) trying to find something \\"acceptable\\" for him to eat (no - won't tell you what \\"magic combination\\" of foods he finally finds \\"desirable!\\"). The story also introduces the \\"crack in the wall\\" that will run through the entire season (and, from the way the last episode ends, we are given to believe it might NOT be over, yet...)    The Beast Below - is a typical story (things aren't always what they seem). Again, everything seems \\"on the run\\" with no \\"lagging\\" moments. I also liked that it was Amy that ends up making the decision that keeps The Doctor from having to make a choice he'd rather not make between the lesser of 2 evils.    Victory of the Daleks - brings back The Doctor's oldest foes - resurrected into new and more ominous/formidable forms - and all thanks to HIM! The story harks back to the old classic stories that would be put in historical settings. Again lots of action, very little \\"dead time.\\"    The Time of the Angels/Flesh and Stone - is a 2-parter, and the only case where I felt things lagged a bit. I feel it's a case of having too much story, for just ONE episode...but not quite enough to fully fill-out TWO episodes. It brings back the \\"Weeping Angels\\" of the episode \\"Blink.\\" Apart from the slight \\"drag,\\" I didn't care a lot for River Song. If her character were \\"tweaked\\" just a bit, I'd probably like her better - but there is just enough \\"off\\" that I can't quite get over the feeling that I'm just \\"putting up\\" with her, because I \\"have\\" to. (Demons? Angels? Uhm...no. They're ALIENS! And there were stories with Tennant, that I saw as being SO \\"religiously symbolic,\\" that they actually made me feel uncomfortable. But THIS story is NOT one of them...)    The Vampires of Venice - This time Amy's boyfriend Rory (actually, soon-to-be-husband...well...he's SUPPOSED to be her \\"soon-to-be-husband!\\" ;-) are taken along by The Doctor as sort of a \\"gift\\" on a trip to Venice (1500's). Vampires? Well, of COURSE NOT! This is Doctor Who. What WOULD you expect? (that's right - ALIENS!) But, as The Doctor says, \\"What kind of aliens could be so \\"terrible,\\" that making themselves out to be vampires would be BETTER than what they really are?\\"    (Oh...and from what I saw of the preview for the next episode...it would look like Rory and Amy DO get married - but hey, this is Doctor Who...and, as we all know, NOTHING is ever what it SEEMS...)    Every time I watched another of these episodes, I kept thinking, \\"This is TOO GOOD! SOMETHING is going to happen. I kept watching and waiting for signs that the season was going to start slipping \\"back\\" to what the New series was like. But it never did...it just kept getting better - and Better - and BETTER! I'm still sitting here, grinning from ear to ear.     And - for the first time since the Classic series - I just CAN'T WAIT for the next episodes! (Yes - I will be getting another pass, and buying the WHOLE season!) And YES...I WILL be watching these AGAIN, while I'm waiting!

0307454541|1.0|I hated this book and will not be buying any of the sequels.  The characters are all bereft of any morality and the mystery is really inferior.  The plot seems only to be interspersed with the \\"suspense\\" between sex scenes. While I could muster some sympathy for the title character, the author failed to win my affection for the protagonist.  I know it's \\"hip\\" now to like this scatter-shot type of fiction but, give me a good old- fashioned mystery any day.<br />I also found it difficult to get accustomed to the foreign spelling of words although it does lend to the authenticity of place.  But, while I usually enjoy reading about foreign locales, I found this one off-putting.  Even Daniel Silva's communist buildings have a certain \\"accessibility\\" about them.  This was just stark.<br />Even though this book is being made into a movie, I don't recommend it, although I may see the movie just to find out how much of the plot is changed.  Maybe Hollywood can add some pizzazz to this less-than-thriller.

B000MXPE7O|5.0|This is one of those films about which people feel very strongly, positive or negative:  it does not fit into an easy category (e.g. Bond-like action), has extraordinary nuance that speaks to very specific interests (bureaucratic power, the private life of spies, civilian control over dirty tricks, elite secret societies), and has wonderfully understated acting that hides what is going on underneath more than acts it out.  If it isn't for everyone, I found it utterly fascinating and engaging all the way through.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a group initiated into Yale's Skull & Bones club, the elite of the elite who gain connections that will benefit them for the rest of their lives after they are \\"chosen\\" and submit to bizarre rituals.  In the mid-1930s, they were white, from privileged WASP families from the NE, and naively patriotic (e.g. George HW Bush).  While fitting in, Damon's character has subtle problems:  son of a suicide who was apparently corrupt and perhaps even a traitor, deeply troubled in his relationships, and deeply secretive to protect his innermost feelings.  Taken into the OSS and married after an almost accidental sexual encounter, he grows into a master spy at the moment that his Skull & Bones \\"brothers\\" are founding the CIA.  He becomes one of their early top officials.<br /><br />The viewer enters into the spy's world view, not as dashing swashbucklers, but as the ultimate manipulators of events and opinions from bureaucratic perches in depressingly plain offices.  Their mission is to protect American security, but their activities define their purview in a far wider way than merely military.  Even the architect behind it (de Niro) has misgivings, which the younger \\"brothers\\" apparently do not.  In many ways, they begin to be corrupted by their power, which they love yet are not overt about it.  It is a wonderful study of how a professional bureaucracy evolves into ever new areas.  The violence, which underpins everything they are managing, makes only a few brief appearances, which are frighteningly realistic, subdued yet sudden.  Trusting no one, through Damon you see how it impacts their private lives.<br /><br />The Damon character, who had great potential to grow in a very different direction, becomes completely consumed by his duty and subtle lust for power as he masses evidence on his own colleagues as well.  His wife, a great beauty from a Skull & Bones family (Jolie in an unusually subtle role that matches her talents), suffers terribly from his mission-driven egotism, as does his son; they live with constant fear and dread.  In a way, he self-destructs, but at the same time he is an extraordinary achiever and, in my view, a completely believable psychological profile:  he was working to please an absent parent, was driven by his sense of class and purpose, and had extreme talent.  But all of this is revealed in ways that must be interpreted, a layer below his gloomy, dutiful surface, which is great fun if you like to let characters like this enter your imagination.<br /><br />The plot is also wonderfully complex, if somewhat confusing with all the skips in time.  It is based around the failure of the Bay of Pigs fiasco.  A seeming friend, his Soviet counterpart is seeking ways to undermine and co-opt him:  his efforts are yet another way that complicates the Damon character's life, with terrible consequences that once again are not completely spelled out.  Did he follow the route of his father?  Somewhat less?  Can you become partially corrupt?  Or did he betray the last things he held dear for the sake of his career and integrity?  There are no clear answers to these questions, but if the film has spoken to you, you formulate your own answers.  This is filmmaking, in my view, at its absolute best.<br /><br />Recommended as a masterpiece.  All the details are as delicious as they are deliberate.

B0002858YS|5.0|Wow what can i say about Hot Fuss, so many thoughts and feelings come to mind. You don't buy this album just for \\"Mr.Brightside\\" you buy it for every track. Few bands in this decade can put out an album where every track has the potential to be a hit single. This is easily The Killers best album, now dont get me wrong i love \\"Sam's Town\\" and \\"Day&Age\\" but i keep coming back to Hot Fuss. The songs are incredibly catchy and well written. It really takes me back to my senior year of high school when I really became a fan. I never get tired of listening to this amazing album. More than anything i love the way i feel when listening to this record. The songs really capture how i felt back then and now. The Synths, Synths, Synths in this album is what really sets it apart from other albums and I cant get enough of them. Dave Keuning's guitars are crazy good. Its 80's synth music with a well done pop/rock & new/wave twist. I really think they have what it takes to reach U2 size popularity and worldwide reach along with Coldplay too.
0143038419|2.0|This book seriously annoyed me. Here are the three positive things I can say about it: First it's a unique concept: one woman decides to spend a year living in Italy, India, and Indonesia to expand her horizons and hopefully experience great self-discovery. Second, the book itself is well-written. Third, author Elizabeth Gilbert uses self-deprecating humor quite effectively throughout the book.<br /><br />So why, after all that praise, do I think this book sucks? Gilbert herself is a super annoying, pathetic, and selfish ego-maniac. Yes, she went through a difficult divorce...so do 50% of the women in this country. Then she went through another bad breakup...tough. Do all women who emerge from failed relationships fall completely apart the way this chick did? No. And does everyone who goes through a difficult period in life have to put their real life on hold for a year in order to deal with all their crap and figure out what to do with themselves? NO. What a loser.<br /><br />The book is divided into three parts, one for each country the author lives in during this time. I thought the Italy section was tolerable enough, just because I am fascinated by Italian culture and love Italian food...and trust me, food is all Gilbert talks about in this part of the book. The India section is all about Gilbert trying to find God and become more spiritual. (Trust me when I tell you that this entire third of the book is SUPER BORING.) The last part of the book involves the author going to Indonesia, falling for a Brazilian dude (so much for her self-imposed celibacy), and trying to raise money to help a new friend buy a house. I found most of this section to be ridiculous to the point that I wonder if the author made most of it up. Seriously.<br /><br />I think that any other woman who went on this year-long journey of self-discovery would come away learning a lot more than Gilbert appears to have. The book would have been much better if anyone other than Gilbert wrote it. I seriously cannot remember another time that I read a memoir and came away from it detesting the author as much as I do in this case. Avoid this book at all costs.another time that I read a memoir and came away from it detesting the author as much as I do in this case. Avoid this book at all costs.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|\\"Up\\" tells the story of Carl, an elderly man who recently lost his beloved wife, Ellie, and is determined to abide by a promise he made her long ago to take their house to the top of South America's beautiful Paradise Falls. A retired balloon seller, Carl devises a plan to lift his home off its foundation and fly to the Falls using thousands of helium balloons. Once his journey begins, Carl is shocked to discover that he has a stowaway on board: Russell, a neighborhood Wilderness Explorer Scout who's desperate to earn his Elderly Assistance Badge by helping Carl. Over the course of their adventure, Carl and Russell encounter a gang of talking dogs, a giant exotic bird, and a dangerous explorer who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Carl ultimately discovers that he still has a whole lot of living to do.<br /><br />I love that Pixar is brave enough to roll with such ingenious ideas that go completely against the norm when it comes to making children's films. \\"Up\\" is a great story that will touch the hearts of kids and adults alike. In fact, the first 10 minutes of the movie are so incredibly touching and heartbreaking that they left me, a 30-year-old woman, literally in tears. I don't think any other animated film has ever affected me so much. \\"Up\\" is fantastic. See it ASAP.

B000001FHV|5.0|I've enjoyed the Meat Puppets on and off over the years. They are excellent musicians, but sometimes their songs just seem to miss the mark with me. Almost every song on this CD hits the spot, however, and some go over the top with me. \\"Backwater\\" is one of the latter, as it is one great song. These guys can so incredible things on the guitar when they want. Curt Cobain looked up to them and had them on as guest artists for his acoustic performance on \\"MTV Unplugged.\\" He knew his music and musicians.<br /><br />I wonder if the reason the group didn't really take off when this CD came could have something to do with the interviews the Meat Puppets were doing before and around this time. In several interviews I heard, they came off as egotistic smartasses topped with a sizable dose of sarcasm. I can forgive them that if their music lives up to my standards, and it certainly does on this CD in particular. I highly recommend it!

I loved Lewis's \\"The New, New Thing\\" as well.
B000IJ79V6|5.0|When the Richard Donner version came out in 2006, I gave it a positive review on this website, hailing it over the original theatrical version.  The reason that I did that is for the love and support of Christopher Reeve after he passed away, since he was upset when Richard Donner was fired.  I have to say though, and I believe Mr. Reeve is listen in heaven, this version credited to Richard Lester is the better one.  I was thrilled in this original version when Mr. Reeve got the second billing (even though he should have gotten first) and his acting and energy are beyond belief.  And I will admit the Eiffel Tower scene is better than the missle scene from the original film.  To see Christopher Reeve's face when he stops the cargo to say to Margot Kidder, \\"I believe this is your floor!\\" we know we are looking at a legend.  In 1985, I viewed this version on channel 7 (ABC), which had extra scenes as it ran 3 hours with commercials.  It was the second time the film was shown, as I could not see it the first time as I was at a communion  The most memorable scene that was added is when Zod puts the boy's father (Jodie) down when asked and the extra scene appears.  The boy goes for help on a horse and Non throws the police siren at him.  We then see an explosion of the boy and the horse (not bloody or anything). Last but not least, a woman says to Ursa, he was just a \\"boy\\".  Ursa says sadistically that he will never become \\"a man\\".  Extremely powerful, I will say.  The villains are excellent, as well as our familiar cast from the first film.  Mr. Reeve, I just want you to know that your first sequel, which is a rare situation, succeeds your original film.  This is because a superb energy throughout the film, where you are #1.  I also find the symbolism in this film more hidden but even better.  The fact that Superman's mother disagrees with him being with Lois Lane is an example of Superman being married to the world like Jesus Christ was and not to be intimate with another person.  And we did need humor in this film, as this was the darkest one, partly being that the villains are heartless (excellent acting) and our hero has turned weak because of intimate love (brilliant as well).  I just want to remained you Mr. Reeve that Superman II and every film you have done, which I have seen, show what an amazing actor you are and you as Superman, a Christ figure.  Actually, you always were a Christ figure, as you ended up showing the world you really were Superman.  Love you, Joseph
B00362DRQS|4.0|Sadly I was disappointed in the small amount of videos on this set. When I first ordered it, they listed all the songs that Tiger Tiger covered. In my haste - I thought it was the videos. \\"Tiger Tiger\\" is actually the concert.<br />While that's my fault, the next item that irked me was the packaging. The case is nice, but the disks are stored in cardboard sleeves which can scratch the edges. I'll have to move all 3 disks into cases.<br />If you're a fan, do buy this. It's not \\"Dancing On The Valentine\\", but the quality is breathtakingly sharp and clear. It actually more vivid than my memories of the videos.<br />Adding the short \\"movie\\" that New Moon On Monday was shot for was a nice bonus.

B001TH8UUA|5.0|As Amazon moves into own-branding, you can be pretty sure that they will only put the brand on stuff that truly meets a set of fairly stringent requirements. This cable is a case in point. It functions perfectly. Even so, I purchased another HDMI cable from an Amazon vendor; the connectors were identical, but the cable itself was thicker. Whether the extra thickness was just additional plastic or better shielding, I cannot tell. But this explains why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 for \\"quality of materials\\". Realistically though, I'm pretty sure that both cables will last for a good length of time.

B002ZG977Y|3.0|This is a remake with a twist.  A good remake as far as remakes go.     As usual, it had it's pros and cons compared to the original:    Pros - The Medusa Scene IS the best scene in the movie, the action scenes were better, I liked that they changed the end, giving a hint that more's to come. I liked the black pegasus, and that they showed more of them, like he's one of many.     Cons - The scorpions were dull but funny at the same time, the witches were the ugliest, nastiest witches I have ever seen.    One thing I hate, is that the only action we got from the gods were that of Hades and Zues.   I expected to see more action with the gods.   Very disappointed with that.   They're just standing around doing nothing....The trailers lead me to think otherwise...    One thing is for sure Sam has to buff up a bit for the next movie.

030726999X|4.0|Stieg Larsson was born in 1954, was a journalist and an expert on anti-democratic and far-right organisations. He died suddenly in November 2004, shortly after delivering the manuscripts for three crime novels - known together as the Millennium Trilogy - to a Swedish publisher. \\"The Girl Kicked the Hornets' Nest\\" is the third part of this trilogy.<br /><br />The book begins where \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" finished. Salander - who, amazingly, is still alive - is on her way to hospital to deal with the bullet in her head. She's very lucky to be operated on by Doctor Anders Jonasson : despite recognising Salander from all the press coverage, he'd go through Hell and high water to save a patient. The operation is tricky, though there's no major brain damage -the bone fragments near the entry wound are, apparently, a little more dangerous than the bullet itself. (These fragments are embedded in an area of the brain normally associated with mathematical ability. As it happens, the only long-term damage seems to be that Salander can't remember her proof for Fermat's Third Theorem). As time goes on - proves he's even willing to bend the rules a little to help a patient out. (Salander comes to view him as an ally - a rare honour).<br /><br />Unfortunately, things aren't going so well at the scene of the crime. Thanks to the police officer in charge, Inspector Paulsson, Blomkvist has been handcuffed, Niedermann has been untied and - bizarrely - the logs in the woodshed are being counted. As it turns out, Paulsson shouldn't even have been left in charge of a donut, let alone a crime scene. Someone had forgotten to mention he was medically unfit for duty and his medication left him with no idea what he was doing. To make things even worse, only one of the cops he sent to untie Niedermann survived - and the second only barely made it. Niedermann, unsurprisingly, quickly made tracks. (What did surprise me, however, is that he only plays a very minor role in this book).<br /><br />The dust, eventually, settles; Blomkvist is released and Salander comes through her operation - though she will spend some time in hospital recovering. It's clear she's innocent of the three murders she'd been connected to in \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\", but she's not out of the woods yet. With Zala hospitalised and Niedermann missing, the main threat, however, now comes \\"The Section\\" - a top-secret grouping within the Security Police. They had been responsible for handling Zala since his defection and a great deal of what they'd done had been both totally illegal and wholly immoral. Nevertheless, to ensure the Section's continued existence, everything regarding Zala will have to be kept away from the courts and out of the public eye. While the Section aren't alone in wanting Salander \\"dealt with\\", they're apparently unaware of how many people willing to fight her corner.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\\" is a huge book - but so enjoyable that I finished it more quickly than some other shorter books. The only thing about the book I couldn't really take seriously was Blomkvist's apparently limitless appeal to women. (The romance he kicks off in this book...well, not only did it seem to be a case of opposites attracting, but his dribbling infatuation seemed very much at odds with the Blomkvist we'd come to know from the previous books). Still, everything about the case was tied up very nicely come the end of the book and I was genuinely sorry to have finished it. It was also a little frustrating to learn that Larsson  had another seven books planned - I can't help but wonder what we'd have learned about the characters if he'd survived.lly, settles; Blomkvist is released and Salander comes through her operation - though she will spend some time in hospital recovering.

Having been a Beatles fan for all these many years I didn't think there was anything else left to experience. I was WRONG!  The show was a masterpiece and purchased the cd as we exited the theater as a memento of our youth.  Grab a plane to Vegas, go to the Mirage and see for yourself.  Just take me with you!<br /><br />Enjoy!
1416955070|3.0|Now, please keep in mind there is more to this book than the hunky torso on the cover! Mortal Instruments: City of Bones by Cassandra Clare is the first installment of a trilogy, all of which is written, published and out in the world. I cannot tell you how much I love when that happens! Nothing makes me crazier than getting sucked into a great book only to find it has absolutely no ending because it is the first book of a trilogy! Drives me crazy! But when I stumble upon an already finished trilogy/series? So exciting!<br /><br />City of Bones starts off with Clary, a normal girl raised by her mother, who does normal things, forgets homework, hangs out with her friends, and occasionally finds herself in a spot of trouble. But one night, at a club with her friend Simon, she sees something sketchy going on- a guy being lured into a janitor's closet by a girl and two tattooed, scary guys. When she breaks into the room, she quickly discovers the guy being attacked isn't so innocent after all- actually he is a demon and the others are Shadowhunters- a group of humans, also known as Nephilim, who are sworn by blood and genealogy to kill all demons and any Underworlders who break the rules of the Accords. Underworlders are all the half-human creatures like vampires, werewolves and faeries who have created a life of peace (sort of) and harmony with the rest of the world. The Accords are a peace treaty the Shadowhunters struck with the Underworlders to stop hunting them if they continue to leave mortal humans (known as mundies or mundanes) alone in their ignorance.<br /><br />But when her mother calls and frantically tells Clary not to come home, Clary goes anyway and finds herself face to face with a Ravener demon, but her mother is mysteriously gone. Jace, the huge blond Shadowhunter, finds Clary with the Ravener dead, but her in desperate need of mystical medical attention. He takes her back to the Institute, where Hodge, the Institute's leader, makes sure she is healed and fully restored. It is with the Institute and the Shadowhunters that Clary finds the true nature of who she is, who her mother is, and even who her \\"uncle\\" Luke really is: all with Shadowhunter blood. But now Valentine, a rogue Shadowhunter determined to kill all Downworlders despite the Accords, is back from the dead and ready to start his plan with the Mortal Cup- the only thing that can make more Shadowhunters from mortals- but at a steep price. Clary, Jace, and the two other Shadowhunters, Alec and Isabelle, must find the Mortal Cup while also finding out how Clary came to be immersed in the mundie world with no recollection of her Shadowhunter heritage.<br /><br />This book is very, very interesting and I am thanking the writing and publishing Gods for pushing the other two books out before I found this one, because it certainly does not end with any semblance of closure- it was meant to keep you waiting for the rest of the trilogy. Clare's take on the mythical world of faeries and vampires is really interesting, and different from other stories of the same genre, while not changing their backgrounds too much. The Shadowhunters are a great addition to these time honored horror tales, and they are wrapped up in their own wars, disagreements, and factions. The writing isn't terribly complicated, the vocabulary is average, but the book is large- almost 500 pages. If you had a kid who made it through Harry and Twilight, this would be a great next step to keep them hooked! Give the Mortal Instruments series a chance, but don't be surprised if you start seeing faeries and pixies in the shrubs after you do!ed.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|This was the greatest of James Cameron's works. I'm not going to say it was the greatest movie of all times, but it sure caught my attention. Sure, Cameron took many ideas from other things like the plot being from Pocahontas, some of the ships being from Halo, and many other ideas, but he created them in his own image on this new planet. One of the coolest scenes is when the movie opens up, and Jake Sully, actor Sam Worthington, is in the giant space ship.  One of the coolest ideas in this entire movie is the sense that everything on the planet is connected by some sort of biological idea, and Eywa is their god, so to speak. The only way to talk to her is through the Tree of Souls.  This movie is a great action movie. It verges right on the edge of being too filled with action, but at the same time, it holds itself back just enough to be a great movie.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|Ok, the guitarist knows how to bring it.  Some of the solos on this album are amazing.  The riffs are generally very tight, and well written.    The singer is so bad it makes me wish they were all instrumentals.  I can't stand their ego, thinking they are really hardcore and heavy.    The song \\"Seize the day\\" is HORRIBLE.  I have hardly ever heard a song worse.    The drumming is ok, but sounds over produced and fake.  The bassist... Well you can't hear him.  I'm not even sure they have one.    The guitarist should leave this band or, start a new one where his talent can shine and not be held back by below average band members.     A lot of the songs were clearly made just for the radio.  It makes me sad that people listen to this, then they think they are listening to heavy metal.    I would NOT recommend this.  If you are new to hard rock and metal, and you like this, then get it, but I would stay away.  A better place to start with heavy metal is the origin, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, or Guns N Roses and Van Halen.

B002W24E0G|5.0|I heard the song \\"Baby You Crazy\\" on Little Steven's Underground Garage FM Radio show and LOVED IT!    I honestly was not expecting to hear a song like this on the radio, and even more surprised to find out it is from the 21st century! You'd think it was from the last century.    Love it... For now I just bought the mp3 of \\"Baby You Crazy\\", but I definitely plan on buying the album when I get extra cash...    Definitely a gem, and it belongs in everybody's rock collection...especially fans of ORIGINAL rock and roll like Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Beatles, Creedence/CCR, etc....    If you want a good sample track, buy/download \\"Baby You Crazy\\"...that should be more than enough to convince you to buy this album and support this group!
030726999X|4.0|A bittersweet moment coming to the end of Stieg Larsson's third and final addition to the Millenium Trilogy. I haven't ran into a heroine as uniquely complex and wonderfully flawed as Lisbeth Salendar. I do, however, wish there was more from her in this book. I missed her constant commentary that we were introduced to in Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Still a great read and a fun adventure.
0143115723|5.0|This is one of the finest books I have ever read.  As someone who loves rugby and politics in equal measure it really hit the spot with me.  It is SOOOO much better than the movie.  I smiled at the end of the movie; I cried for the last three chapters of the book.  John Carlin is a phenomenally evocative  writer; he puts you right there, helps you to understand the complexities of both the political times and the sport without patronising.  A lesson for the ages!

Can't wait for day 30!!
0316776963|5.0|Honesty. Pure, unrivaled honesty. Even Augusten Burroughs' tales of family crazies cannot touch the honesty of David Sedaris's written word, and Me Talk Pretty One Day is no exception. He is brutally honest when describing his father's obsession with saving and eating food long past its expiration date. He is painfully honest when he discloses his drug abuse while feigning artistic inclinations. I think it is this honesty that makes me love Sedaris. I am truly jealous of the candor with which he can tell any story, no matter how embarrassing or slandering it might be. It amazes me that his honesty can literally make me sob but a few pages later can make me laugh until I cry.    The dramatic, emotional swings are paralleled in the bi-continental setting of the short stories in Me Talk Pretty One Day. Sedaris explores the entire spectrum of his life from the time he is his South Carolina grade school taking speech lessons to lessen his lisp to his forays into learning French while living in France, the short story providing the title line. The book is full of binaries: self-conscious pre-teen to self-accepting fifty-something, despising his family to accepting the quirks of his parents and five siblings, and drug addicted to stone sober.   These binaries are not special to Me Talk Pretty One Day, however. Naked, When You Are Engulfed in Flames, and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Blue Jeans all exemplify Sedaris's honest look at the changes one takes in life. He is able to poignantly address crazy neighbors and Christmas whores but also look at the funny side of death and addiction. Perhaps the thing that makes Me Talk special is that Sedaris deftly balances the bittersweet with absurd in a way that, at the end of the book, makes you feel like you've just walked away from one really great therapy session where you realized that a) you can deal with your problems and b) at least you don't have it as bad as this Sedaris guy.     And it is so funny. I laughed until I snorted. This is not to say that Sedaris's other books are not funny because they are very much so, but Me Talk just has something special about it that makes it unique. Again, Sedaris's honest look at himself is what makes it so personal and like a close best friend. He is able to find the humor in the fact that he is not as smart as his partner and his partner makes him feel better about this fact by stating that he is good at things like \\"vacuuming and naming stuffed animals.\\"  My favorite part of the book occurs in the short story with the same title as the book, in which Sedaris takes us through his evolution from speaking one French word at a time (\\"ashtray\\" and \\"bottleneck\\") to speaking French phrases: \\"'Is them the thoughts of cows?' I'd ask the butcher, pointing to the calves displayed in the front window. `I want me some lamb chop with handles on `em.'\\" I can open to the page this quote appears on and laugh out loud like I had never read it before.     This book is so worth the money and time. If you've not read Sedaris before, this is a great place to start. If you are a longtime fan of Sedaris, you will appreciate his ability to make you think deeply about hilarious instances and to make you laugh at things you probably shouldn't laugh at.
B000009N6M|5.0|greatest LP I've ever bought, incredible look and sound even when it's a LP, really recommended for those people interested in alternative music!
B000M3452Y|1.0|Clearly I'm not in the demographic this music was made for.  I will admit that I'm 40 something but I still love a lot of the new music coming out these days but I just do not understand why so many people gave this 4 or 5 stars.  I may be going out on a limb but this music reminds me of Beck, only not as original or interesting.  While Beck's \\"singing\\" wasn't really the strong suit of his music, at least it had hooks that made it fun, funky and memorable.  This, on the other hand is simply boring and uninspired.  The vocals here - and we can all agree that from a musically aesthetic perspective, don't always have to sound pretty (i.e. Tom Waits, Bob Dylan, Springsteen - no disrespect as they are all truly amazing) are just bad.  Waits voice is like gravel with emphysema but it haunts you.  Dylan's whiney, almost sneering and often incomprehensible delivery comes across like a jazzy improvisational saxophone.  The Boss sings many of his songs as if he's 500 miles of bad interstate that has seen way too much bad weather and accidents and yet keeps you riveted to hear the story.  I can find nothing in this music that draws my interest level even slightly.  The beats that so many people are raving about just aren't that infectious and the music doesn't really move or groove, it sort of just sits there.  To make what I feel is an apt comparison of similar modern music, the Broken Bells draws on the very same 1980s esque vibe and they simply do it better.  The purists out there may criticize me by comparing these artists but if they aren't in the same solar system, they most definitely are in the same galaxy and LCD Soundsystem's Sound of Silver just doesn't beg to be explored.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|Do you know what \\"Sex and the City 2\\" reminds me of? It reminds me of that episode of \\"Absolutely Fabulous\\" where Eddie and Patsy go to Morocco, intending to indulge in drugs, sex and decadent luxury.<br /><br />But while that episode was intended to MOCK aging fashionistas, \\"Sex and the City 2\\" instead tries to glorify them -- which is kind of annoying in a massive recession. The entire movie is basically a dragged out travelogue of a sparkly idealized Middle-East where the main characters can prance around in designer clothes, unencumbered by an actual plot or real problems.<br /><br />It opens first with a flashback to when the four protagonists met, followed by a wildly kitschy gay wedding (swans, choirs, Liza Minnelli) for two guys who have nothing to do with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Instead we're treated to the woes of the main characters -- Sam (Kim Cattrall) is desperately staving off menopause, Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is dealing with a sexist boss, Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) has discovered that marriage isn't one long honeymoon, and Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is struggling with a sexy nanny and the discovery that raising kids involves some self-sacrifice. Boohoo.<br /><br />So they do the logical thing: They go to Abu Dhabi, Carrie runs into an old boyfriend, and eventually they cause a culture clash... in the Middle East. SHOCK. Yes, that's pretty much the entire story.<br /><br />\\"Sex and the City 2\\" is the worst thing a sequel can be -- totally superfluous. The \\"Sex and the City\\" series has never really been plot heavy, since it's all basically vicarious enjoyment of someone else's surreally luxurious life... but this movie is the cinematic equivalent of hearing someone ramble about their vacation, while being tortured by their photos.<br /><br />The entire movie is a tacky flurry of celebrity cameos (Miley Cyrus? Penelope Cruz?), designer dresses and painfully contrived problems (an old boyfriend who JUST HAPPENS to be in the same city as Carrie!). It's bad enough when we have to hear the women whining about real life intruding on their lives, but once they get to Abu Dhabi it becomes brain-numbing -- think cliche slapstick, lame dialogue and every Arab stereotype under the desert sun.<br /><br />Moreover, the movie feels DATED -- there are mentions of the recession the U.S. is mired in, but everybody is still wallowing in obscene luxury (only two vast apartments, oh woe!). And while there's a little lip service paid to the plight of Middle-Eastern women, the result is just grotesque (\\"A veil cuts back on the Botox bill!\\" and American designer dresses under the burqas -- are you offended yet?).<br /><br />And since they're now getting pretty elderly for their cool sexy urbanite roles, the actresses seem to have morphed into desperate, pathetically immature parodies of themselves. Parker just flits around being annoying, selfish and bratty, and she's looking more like a Japanese tengu every day. Davis and Nixon are there to whine about motherhood, and Cattrall is just getting ridiculous.<br /><br />\\"Sex and the City 2\\" is nothing more than a giant catwalk for the four lead actresses to strut upon -- lots of clothes, lots of whining, lots of sand, and no substance to any of it.r the women whining about real life intruding on their lives, but once they get to Abu Dhabi it becomes brain-numbing -- think cliche slapstick, lame dialogue and every Arab stereotype under the desert sun.

0618918248|2.0|A quick perusal of the above reviews will tell you one thing: people read this book with preconceived notions and then repeat their predefined reaction after reading this book, with few exceptions.  The persons that had already read and enjoyed works by Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens will again find validation in this book.  The persons that had read them (or not read them as it the more likely case) and found them offensive, will again find someone to vilify.  Therefore, I feel it necessary to validate my precontrived notions prior to giving my thoughts on the book.<br /><br />I believe in God, though I am far from religious.  I am politically very liberal and I live in the Deep South, which does not lend well to finding a friendly church.  I have actually been asked to leave one over my beliefs, and chosen to leave another following multiple disagreements with the church.  My relationship with organized religion is cool at best and mildly hostile at worst.  Nevertheless, I have read the Bible in full, and count C.S. Lewis amongst my favorite authors of all time, and approach my religious beliefs with a much more open mind than do many of my Christian contemporaries.  Other than my political affiliation, I have found equal hostility toward my beliefs regarding Evolution.  I had read Dr. Dawkins elegant work \\"The Selfish Gene\\" early in my college career and absolutely loved it.  I have since taken many higher level courses in Evolutionary Biology and read several other books on the subject by men like Sean B. Carrol and John Coyne.  As a future physician with a strong interest in Infectious Diseases, I consider myself an ardent and active defender of Evolution.  All of that said, I think I may be as near to objective in my approach to this book as is possible.  However, I know that I can never be fully objective and so, as you read this review, take it with a grain of salt.<br /><br />I alluded to the works of Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens above (\\"Letter to a Christian Nation\\" and \\"God is Not Great\\"), and in \\"The God Delusion\\" one is to find more of the same ascerbic and condescending approach to the subject of religion.  In both of the above books and the one treated here, one word comes to my mind throughout the readings: disdain.  In chapter after chapter, Dr. Dawkins discusses each aspect of religion in a tone that drips of sarcasm and the sort of intellectual snobbery made so famous by such pundits as Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck.  Dr. Dawkins dismisses everything about religion out of hand.  On multiple occasions, he insists that the vast majority of the scientific community are either devoted atheists or uninterested agnostics.  He then asserts that even the religiuos must either be putting up a front, or in their belief, are forfeit of any credibility in the intellectual commmunity.  After two or three chapters of this sort of attitude, it begins to wear on this particular reader.<br /><br />Granted, I can understand the reaction in the New Atheist movement (or Evangelical Atheism as I have called it in the past).  For a millenia, scientific progress has been staunched again and again by the meddlings of power hungry clergy and close minded reactionaries.  Even today, adherents to Evolution, The Big Bang, and other such \\"contentious\\" subjects are treated with disdain and hostility on a daily basis and given the sort of media legitimacy that the Anti-Vaccine and Climate Change deniers enjoy.  In all cases, the scientific proof is undeniable and has no legitimate detractors in the scientific data, and yet they all receive enough media attention to produce a distinct division in the popular arena.  As a person that has grown up in the Deep South, the haven of Evangelical Christian movements and the most conservative of the conservative, I have seen and been a subject of such derision.  It is not a good feeling.  And yet, in these New Atheists, we see Newton's Law proven.  The reaction from this crowd is just asequal in nasty language, open disdain, and unprovoked animosity as their detractors in the very religious and the very conservative.  The only difference is that the New Atheists enjoy the cloak of Intellectual Superiority, which they flaunt quite openly (as very evident in many of the above reviews).<br /><br />Despite my negative perception thanks to his tone and open disregard for any opposing views, Dr. Dawkins is a much more informed and eloquent defender of Atheism (and Evolution before his new favorite cause).  In many of the New Atheist works I have read, and in Sam Harris' \\"A Letter to a Christian Nation,\\" evolution is used as a major plank in the proof against a God.  However, in these works, men like Harris are paraphrasing the real scientists like Dawkins without ever gaining a full grasp of the subject.  A favorite passage of mine in \\"A Letter to a Christian Nation,\\" Harris notes that the existence of over 200, 000 species of beatles should be proof enough that there isn't a God.  There is no qualifier or further explanation, and it speaks volumes to his poor understanding of the subject.  Dr. Dawkins, however, is an enormous mind in the Evolution arena and treats the subject with the proper understanding.  Though his disdainful tone remains, he does do service to his cause in clearing up some muddled facts and borrowed figures.  He also makes the point to tackle the idea of humans as a special creation by citing the droves of new planets being found throughout our universe.  As an evolutionist, I certainly understand his disregard of the Creationist insistence that the lack of a discovery of life outside of Earth is proof that there isn't life out there.  Again and again, the Creationist insistence that the lack of intermediate species in the fossil record was proof that there was not one, were over time debunked with the discovery of more and more fossils bearing the overplayed \\"Missing Link\\" label.  Dr. Dawkins, I repeat, does an amazing job of completely and thoroughly laying down his evidence in this book.ut<br /><br />One thing that I was excited to read was his more complete treatment of genocide and religious persecution.  Almost without fail, the New Atheists will hold up Witch Burnings, the persecution of women in Muslim states, and outright war as many of the gifts of religion.  In the next breath, they will usually devalue the work of many of the benevolant missionaries that feed the poor, heal the sick, and build lasting change in the third world based on some of their questionable practices.  Some of these practices include the assent to wholesale destruction of communities for the military complex as in the early colonization of the Americas, the refusal to encourage condom use in AIDS ravaged Africa, the sometimes not so veiled trading of care for a conversion, and the perpetuation of female persectution.  I have a difficult time completely writing off good works for a few backward ways, but Dr. Dawkins presents his point quite thoroughly. Then Dr. Dawkins takes on the subject of Atheistic Communist states.  Until I read this book, I had never seen any of the New Atheists give this subject any opinion.  However, Dr. Dawkins almost simply brushes it aside.  When confronted with the reality of the genocide committed by communist states that were openly Atheistic and hostile to religious figures in their midst, he writes the activities off as a further extension of religion in the form of Nationalism.  I certainly think that this treatment is more than a stretch, and I would have liked to have had a bit more time spent in this subject.<br /><br />My advice for anyone looking at this book would be to read it if you already count yourself a non-believer or a doubter.  You will find in this book a much more thorough and intellectually standardized treatment of the subject.  If, however, that you consider yourself a believer, this book will be a very hard swallow for you with almost no benefit.  In the end, this book felt almost like the equivilent of being lectured by a Bible thumping, Pentacostal, fire breathing reverend in the reverse.  I fear that Dr. Dawkins' association and wholesale engagement in the New Atheist cause will forever color his further work in Evolution.  I can only hope that he can put this mantle down long enough to further contribute to his already stellar work in the field of Evolutionary Bilogy.down his evidence in this book.ut     One thing that I was excited to read was his more complete treatment of genocide and religious persecution.

I have a difficult time completely writing off good works for a few backward ways, but Dr. Dawkins presents his point quite thoroughly. Then Dr. Dawkins takes on the subject of Atheistic Communist states.  Until I read this book, I had never seen any of the New Atheists give this subject any opinion.  However, Dr. Dawkins almost simply brushes it aside.  When confronted with the reality of the genocide committed by communist states that were openly Atheistic and hostile to religious figures in their midst, he writes the activities off as a further extension of religion in the form of Nationalism.  I certainly think that this treatment is more than a stretch, and I would have liked to have had a bit more time spent in this subject.    My advice for anyone looking at this book would be to read it if you already count yourself a non-believer or a doubter.  You will find in this book a much more thorough and intellectually standardized treatment of the subject.  If, however, that you consider yourself a believer, this book will be a very hard swallow for you with almost no benefit.  In the end, this book felt almost like the equivilent of being lectured by a Bible thumping, Pentacostal, fire breathing reverend in the reverse.  I fear that Dr. Dawkins' association and wholesale engagement in the New Atheist cause will forever color his further work in Evolution.  I can only hope that he can put this mantle down long enough to further contribute to his already stellar work in the field of Evolutionary Bilogy.
B001U0HBPG|4.0|When this film was released it struck me as having a silly premise and I had no interest in seeing it.  I was surprised when it was nominated for several Oscars.  When I signed up for Netflix I put it in my queue and then forgot about it until it arrived in the mail. It is a beautiful film to watch - the sets and costumes were so effective that the history flowed flawlessly. The story is well known in general, but while watching it I never had that exasperating feeling that I knew exactly what would happen next. The dialogue was well written, which is not true of a lot of films.      For some reason I wasn't emotionally drawn into the story - but I think to some degree that is because when you watch a film at home it's easy to get distracted with other things.
B001MEJY8W|2.0|My copy just arrived today, and it has a totally different cover from the one advertised on here.<br />I personally really like it, its quite creepy, and gruesome, but this may bother others.<br />Also the running time on imdb says 99min, and its advertised on here as 100min, and mine says 96min.. so im hoping that this isnt some weird cut version.<br />I live in australia, and i went out of my way to order the unrated region 1 version, because it was 1 minute OVER the running time, and the region 4 (australian) copy says 97min, which is 2 minutes UNDER the running time.<br />And as a result i end up with a version thats could very well be cut by either 3 or 4 minutes? Not cool amazon..<br />I hope i didnt waste my money..<br />Im giving 2 stars, because the artwork on the cover (that i recieved, not sure about the rest of you) impressed me, but having a complete and uncut version is whats most important to me.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|I purchased this set from Amazon recently and i have got to say this set is a bit underrated. yes there is some graininess to it but otherwise it is a pretty terriffic set filled with 3 terriffc films with bright, vivid wonderful quality and a nice theater feel to it  especally the original two the thrid dosent look too different from its original from from the 2001 collection but it still looks nice in blu. The special freatures are great overall with several fascinating extras and documentaries that deliver some known and unknown info about all different ascepts  of these fine 3 films including all of the old features from the 2001 collection nad some great new features such as Godfather world and the masterpiece that almost wasn't and a feature at how the restoration process was done . All in all a very fine high-quality set with fabulous  bonus features and supplements and obviously the 3 films themselves presented brilliantly. In addition the quality, picture and sound are great as far as i can tell the menus look nice and the casing is attractive-looking.  The packet however is attached to the back instead of in the case so theres an obvious package mishap but still it offers some fascianting info even if we've heard some of it before.  overall  an excellent giftset for gf fans and dispite the grain the set is awesome with several likeable qualites to it and i'd say theres a lot to like here so if you think this is a fine-looking product i don't feel you'd be making a bad purchase with this it's definitely an offer you dont wanna refuse i had a lot of fun with it overall and definitely would recommend it to fans of the blu-ray the godfather series and cool collector sets that are a great addition to movie colletions and are filled with very many great features and qualities.
B00007KWHO|4.0|I will not review the album but they did a good job on the sound which is better than I remember with the LP.  Nice to have the original album cover too but it you flip the booklet over it is the American version to promote the joining of Howe (which happened before this was released).  Some great cuts on this one as always.  As I get older I am appreciating the first two albums more.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Enzo, the dog is on his deathbed, he tells the story of his master's life with a heartbreaking mixture of love, devotion, humor and simplicity. He is at once an old man and a little pup, he sees things people miss, he listens and pays attention. Because he cannot speak and because he doesn't have opposable thumbs, he is trapped in a body of a dog. But he knows that when he dies, his soul will be released in to the world only to come back as a human. Because he had seen a documentary on television and because he is ready.<br />Whether you are a dog-person, a cat-person, or not an animal-person at all, you should read this book. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry and you will stay up late in to the night unable to put it down. But be forewarned, the moment you finish this book you may be struck with an uncontrollable urge to run to the nearest dog shelter and get a mutt of your own.
0393061310|3.0|The first 2/3 of this book was some of the most interesting reading I have done in a long time.  As a plausible description of how primitive man might have socially evolved from small bands of hunter-gatherers, to farming communities raising crops and livestock, to highly-complex literate city states and nations, the first part of this book was fantastic.  Alas, however, the last 1/3 of the book and the deeply flawed biases of the author were almost enough to destroy all that went before.    First of all, do not think of this book as scientific research.  Research begins with an unwavering commitment to discover facts as they are and then to articulate what conclusions can be formed based on them.  This book is not research because the author admits that he begins with the politically-correct conclusion that there are no innate differences between socially advanced human populations and human populations that still live in a state of relative primitivity.  He then spends his time trying to hammer together all of the facts that he can to fit his foreordained conclusion.   In the end, his so-called research doesn't remotely support his conclusion.  Moreover, at one point, he even contradicts his major premise by stating that he thought that members of a certain New Guinea tribe that he (revealingly) spent much time with were more intelligent than most people in more advanced societies.  It seems that this book might be an example of the author \\"going native,\\" a modern day Margaret Mead.  Additionally, the final third of the book is strangely disconnected from the first part, encumbered with monotonous chapters of abstruse East Asian and Polynesian linguistic history in stark contrast to the delightful readability of the first part.  It's as if the author had some really nifty (in his eyes) linguistic research that he wanted to have published so he just stuffed it into the back of this book.      Overall, where he spends his time describing how humans might have developed farming, animal husbandry, writing, and complex city-life, the author is at his best.  Where he spends his time as an apologist for people who still live in a relatively primitive state he is at his worst.  Read it for the former, disregard his conclusions about the latter; especially since, if there truly are absolutely no innate differences between groups of human beings (of whom scientists estimate there have been, throughout human history, some 45 billion), then humans would be the only species about which this is true.  And if it is actually true, you wouldn't know it from reading this book, with it's through-the-looking-glass conclusion first, evidence later approach.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|Movie was awful. No character development. Story ripped off of dances with wolves and countless others.Cheesy Dialogue. If your a mindless droid and love special effects dont care about a story youll love it. When will garbage like this stop?? Doesnt anyone care about a story? I am sick of hollywood these days just looking at us as stupid mindless americans. Stop insulting us we want a story blank your special effects. James Cameron is the biggest garbage director to ever exist, and if you like his movies your a moron that knows nothing about the cinema.
0307463745|5.0|This book can drive you crazy if you are 1) an entrepreneur 2) a student wanting to be a web upstart guy 3) someone who wants to start building a web app but doesn't know where to start.     I've read about 100 pages and can't read anymore. Just because it forces me to leave everything I am doing and sit down and code. I've decided that until I reach a milestone (one that I've decided for my web app that I am working on), I am not reading this anymore.     Complete madness.   Thanks Jason and David.
B001QOGYBI|3.0|I was so disappointed I cursed the $$$ spent buying it.  I'll donate it to the local library, as it's not worth keeping in mine.  There was no real plot, and the animation was \\"stiff\\".  Again, save your money, and time, it's not what one had hoped for.
1594488843|5.0|Have you ever wondered why students seem so bored and unmotivated?     DRIVE shows that external rewards (grades, gold stars, praise, etc.) don't work to motivate, and in most cases they DECREASE drive. It also shows that students need autonomy and real-life experiences (relevance), two things that are very rare in most classrooms. There's so much more - but this book is a goldmine of information and ideas for teachers, parents, and others on how to increase motivation and learning.      While much of the book is aimed at business, almost all of the concepts also apply to education. As a high school teacher, these ideas have completely transformed the way I approach my job. It also made me realize that much of our school system is based on assumptions that JUST DON'T WORK - but also  offers practical suggestions on how to turn this around.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love this series.  Definitely one of those classics that developed a cult following after it was cancelled.  The acting has just enough tones of seriousness under its light hearted humorous surface to make some great points that a viewer can really analyze if they wish to, or just enjoy the lighthearted comedy that plays on the surface.  The cast is great and all of them pull of their characters very well.  Definitely a must see, even if you aren't a sci-fi or western fan.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|What a different twist and entertaining season this was. Never a bland lull in this unique series. Lithgow and Hall both got Goldens for their parts this past season and well and long overdue deserved. This season was different than others but this is the blessings of the series. It is always different and never expected. Dexter, TrueBlood and The Closer are the best TV has to offer. I have already Pre-ordered this DVD even though the series is still on my DVR. Definitely buy, watch and be on the edge of your chair during every episode. It is wonderful to watch all the intertwinings of the series and what will happen next. Keep them coming as I continue to ask for more. I do not want it to end. Go Dex, cannot wait to see what the writers have in store for us this September!
0143034901|5.0|My college rommate told me about this book.  (College was thirty years ago!)  I was hooked and in love with the writing by page 20.  At page 30, I called and emailed four friends who love books and belong to various book clubs, to tell them about this 'discovery,' this new author.  A very interesting read.
1400032717|5.0|Original, entertaining and well worth reading. Haddon captures the pathos of 'Flowers for Algernon', but with more humor and warmth. The book is accessible and funny without losing sensitivity or entertainment value. To maintain the proper tone throughout the length of the book without sacrificing readability or plot is a feat. The book is insightful without being pedantic. While the premise may seem like a writing workshop exercise this story really works and, above all, it is immensely readable. The ending, which some may quibble with, is realistic.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|I'll let my fellow reviewers speak for me with regards to the quality of the movie itself. For myself, I'd like to focus on the quality of this Blu-ray. At first, I was skeptical-- how much benefit could I really expect the Blu-ray format to provide for a hand-drawn film created by a Japanese studio? As it turns out, Ponyo is an amazingly-beautiful film on Blu-ray, far more so than the standard DVD, and well worth the additional investment if you've got a decent HDTV.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This was a little difficult to install on an assembled system, but well worth the time and expense. Applying the thermal compound over the open heat pipes was tricky. It took me two attempts to get an even coverage. Now I can OC my i7 920 and still stay below 75 degrees.
B002VPE7AQ|4.0|When I first heard of this book, I dismissed it. It looked cheesy, predictable, and nothing new. And I hated the cover (I would have prefered it if Alex had his shirt off, thank you). But then, I kept seeing more and more rave reviews, so I gave in. On my next trip to Borders, this book found it's way into my pile.<br /><br />Now here's a story you've all heard before: boy from the bad side of town and the perfect good girl beats the odds and fall in love. The bad boy in this case is Mexican gangbanger, Alex, who does what he has to in order to protect and support his family. The good girl is Brittany, the head cheerleader who leads a seemingly perfect life, but it's all an act as her family is falling apart. Both these characters put on a show for the world, but as they work together on a chemistry project, they might just see what's under the other one's mask and fall in love.<br /><br />Despite myself, I became absorbed in this novel. I kept making excuses so I could slip away for a few minutes and read a chapter or two. I don't know what it was about the writing that made it so inviting, but it worked all the same.<br /><br />But even the writing couldn't detract from some of the cheesiness that oozed off the page sometimes. I mean, some parts were realistic, but others were just like cheez-whiz.<br /><br />And why oh why did Alex and Brittany have to be chemistry partners!<br />Between chemistry and biology class, who needs dating websites? Just take a science course, and there is a 99% guarantee your true love will be assigned to you. Don't worry, if you and your partner seem opposite, that only adds to the sexual tension! Gah......I just don't know anymore.<br /><br />Oh, and the scene where Alex and Brittany finally do it (I probably should have indicated spoilesr, but oh well) I was like WTF. Great morals, Brittany! Sleep with a guy to get him to remember you, and if he never sees you again...well, at least you distracted him enough (SPOILAHS) to get his best friend shot. Way to go.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm a total romantic. I like happy endings, but not at the cost of being unrealistic. So, I'm not sure whether or not I liked the epilogue.<br /><br />So I enjoyed it. Kind of like a guilty pleasure. It had plenty of faults, but I enjoyed it just the same. And I read a little excerpt in the back from Rules of Attraction, and I'm excited to read it as soon as I get my hands on it.<br /><br />Oh, and I was very disappointed when I found out the name of Alex's gang. I was hoping for it to be called the Sharks or the Jets.et me wrong, I'm a total romantic. I like happy endings, but not at the cost of being unrealistic.

0765356147|5.0|Fantastic ending to a thrilling trilogy.  I want to talk about my thoughts for the trilogy as a whole in this review, but first - a few things about the book itself.<br /><br />Sanderson takes about half the book to build up for what is bound to be a spectacular finish.  This is something that actually started to bother me a bit in this book because it's hard work to restrain the impulse to look ahead in the book and figure out how it all works out!<br /><br />As I read this third installment of the Mistborn trilogy I could hear the clicks in my mind, checking off each confusing element, fusing together bits and pieces given in the first two books - basically making the story one that was very plausible and fantastic.  The ONLY real complaint I had was I thought it was completely unnecessary to give a name to the final being - especially a name that holds so many meanings for many people.  But in a way, I guess it makes sense.  It just took away the fantasy element for me and made me go \\"hrm\\".  Read the book - you'll understand (possibly!).  If not, then just ignore this!<br /><br />So on the trilogy as a whole - it's fantastic.  I'd heard of Sanderson only when I learned he was to finish the Wheel of Time series started by Robert Jordan.  So I decided to check him out.  I now know that those final two books should be pretty damn good and.. dangit I'm going to have to go through some of the boring ones again and get caught up when they come out.<br /><br />Sanderson creates a very intricate, very believable and VERY fascinating set of magic rules.  His world is incredibly immersive - to the point where I felt as if I was watching a movie; my imagination was stimulated that much.  I blew through these books and was unable to put them down, I even walked around the house with my nose buried in them.<br /><br />I am already making plans to own the trilogy and I plan to recommend it to fellow fantasy lovers - my dad included.  If you are a fantasy lover and have not read these books put them on your list!
B002K0WBY6|5.0|I love this movie.  It is really great.  Some of the extras were a bit disappointing because they rush through them.  The alternate ending was interesting but I'm glad they went with the other ending.  I like it better.
0312570740|1.0|While it might be true the author would be free to write whatever he wanted, the book reads like the deal between the author and marc was a wink wink nod nod in that the book would be favorable to marc rich and try to redeem himself with the public.    the book lacks the details on how Marc did his deals.  This book is for entertainment purposes only and it is not very useful at all.

0452295548|5.0|Jill Bolte Taylor's book \\"My Stroke of Insight\\" will change the way you use your brain....   After you have fully absorbed the impact of this book's conclusions, you will gradually become positively aware of what your brain's right side has to offer. Beware though: if you are a man you might welcome it more reluctantly.   In any case, at some point you will start to be bothered by the left hemisphere's insistence to predominate. You will notice how hard it is for that left side to share your awareness with the other side - the left side loves to hog the whole bed so to speak...   Eventually - it is to be hoped - both your brain's hemispheres will mutually and reciprocally become appreciative integrated partners... and when this happens not only to you but to more than just a few of us humans, humankind may have a chance to survive 'man'kind!

B001FB55LC|4.0|Please note: This review is for the Blu-ray edition of the film.<br /><br />After his capture by members of the Taliban in Afganistan, Captain Sam Cahill (Tobey Macguire)returns a broken man by his experiences after being forced to commit a heinous act while a captive and suspicious that his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhall)who has helped to hold the family together when they believed he was dead has had an affair with Grace (Natalie Portman)Sam's wife.

While it doesn't quite measure up to the original Danish film which has a plot twist that is missing here that adds power to the conflict between the brothers, Sheridan's film hits most of the right notes and is rarely off key.The performances from each of the actors adds to the film with the lead actors giving strong multi-layered performances. The screenplay by writer David Benioff (\\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\", \\"The Kite Runner\\", \\"Stay\\" and \\"Troy\\")feels authentic but the removal of one major plot twist does rob this film of some of its complexity.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has a sharp, beautiful looking transfer and nicely capturing the lovely Santa Fe landscape. We get an intelligent commentary track with director Jim Sheridan discussing what captivated him about the original drama and his own approach to the material; we also get a trio of featurettes on the production including one that focuses on translating the original film for an American audience without losing the essence of what made the original \\"Brødre\\" so powerful.<br /><br />\\"Brothers\\" may not work as well as the original film due to some changes to the plot of the film but the performances and direction ring so true that one can forgive the change and its impact on this drama.

B0002NQ2B6|4.0|I was crawling through this book and then the good stuff finally arrived. The last third of the book was worth the price of admission in some great observations and especially leadership ideas. I am not really into the business history of technology but Gerstner came through with some leadership nuggets worth remembering. So, it's a fast read if you just skim the first parts of the book and focus on the last.
0194325385|5.0|Its like a dream come true. One of the books you should read in your life time, and it beats every novel you would imagine having fun reading! Btw a dictionary is my most favorite book, and this one is on the top 3 list.
1400082773|5.0|All the while I was reading this, I was thinking, \\"This man is our President?\\" Needless to say, I wouldn't even bat an eye if President Obama decided to step down from his elected position and become a writer.  He's phenomenal.  Do not read this book to gain an insight on our President, or simply because's it Barack Obama.  Read it because it's a great book.  However, as I have said before in previous reviews, skim through the book a bit before deciding to buy, because not everyone's literary tastes are the same.

B002SVBDYQ|1.0|I listened to this album online, so I missed out on a few of the songs, The Killers \\"White Demon Love Song\\" and Yorke's \\"Hearing Damage\\", for example.         I'm no Twilight fan, but I thought the first soundtrack had a few decent songs (\\"I Caught Myself\\", \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth\\".) No such luck with this CD. It starts off half-decently with \\"Meet Me On The Equinox.\\" It's an OK song, but it lasts a little too long, kind of like this Album. The next song, \\"Friends\\", sounds like its guitars were played through a broken amp and its drummer was a little kid banging on a kitchen pot with a wooden spoon. After that, it's one slow, boring song after another. Every song sounds so much the same that if you doze off (which is likely, given how slow and quiet the songs are), you might think that it's just one giant slow indie-rock ballad. \\"Possibility\\" repeats itself like a politician. \\"Sattelite Heart\\" needs to float off into a Supermassive Black Hole. \\"Slow Life\\", the Grizzly Bear/Victoria LeGrand compilation, could pretty much describe the whole album. And if you think that Sea Wolf and Band of Skulls are metal outfits because of their names, think again. The Andre Desplat piece at the end is decent, but after the musical funeral procession, you'll probably be either asleep or breaking the CD. Maybe the songs on this CD are not the best ones by the selected artists. I hope they aren't.       You would think that vampires would want to listen to stuff like Evanescence or My Chemical Romance, but I guess sensitive vampires like Edward listen to hip indie stuff. At best you can torture your indie rocker friends with it by showing them how their favorite artists \\"sold out\\". \\"What? Grizzly Bear? I bet you just know them from the New Moon Soundtrack.\\"
159102594X|2.0|I love epic fantasies.  So when I heard what a great series Abercrombie's First Law series was I am eager to read it.  Overall it was not one of the best epic fantasies I have read: I much prefer any of Brandon Sanderson's Books ([[ASIN:0765350386 Mistborn : Final Empire Series (Book #1) (Mistborn, Book 1)]]), Robert Jordan's [[ASIN:0812511816 The Eye of the World (The Wheel of Time, Book 1)]] series, Jim Butcher's [[ASIN:044101268X Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)]] series, or Scott Lynch's works ([[ASIN:055358894X The Lies of Locke Lamora]]).<br /><br />This book follows the actions of a number of different characters.  Logen Ninefingers is an infamous barbarian that is looking for a path away from killing.  Captain Jezal dan Luthar is a fop that is trying to win a fencing tournament to make his life more comfortable.  Inquisitor Glokta is a crippled torturer who takes care of the realms confessions.  Bayaz is a mysterious mage.  They each have their own agenda but are being drawn into a war between the Northmen and the Union.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that Abercrombie has a writing style that is very easy to read and engaging.  His action scenes are well done.  That is about all I can say positive about this book.<br /><br />The characters are unlikable down to the smallest side character.  They are all selfish, irritating, and just...well...very unlikable.  They aren't really all that fun to read about and many aspects of their personalities are overdone.  For example as a reader I understood right off the bat that Jezal was a selfish, spoiled, idiot.  I kept waiting for his character to gain some depth outside of this stereotype and it never really did.  The whole book I kept hoping the characters would break their mold, do something interesting or surprising, but that never happened.  They all acted as stereotypically and predictably as they possible could.<br /><br />The plot itself tries to be an intricate web of political maneuvering, but in reality nothing much happens in this book.  All the characters are moved from place to place with not a lot happening, basically this book just gets all the characters in the right places and sets things up to send them off some place else in the next book.  The only interesting characters in the whole book are Logan (who may actually have some depth beyond a strict barbarian) and Bayaz (who is mostly a mystery).<br /><br />I will say I am not big on books that totally involve only political machinations.  So that is probably why this book was a bit of a bore to me.  I usually like some adventuring, questing, war (up front, not at a distance), and even the occasional relationship.  I should mention that this book is also into giving you the gory reality of everything, not much is held back...there is also a ton of swearing (which doesn't bother me one way or the other).<br /><br />On a side note being a woman who reads epic fantasies I have really enjoyed that writers such as Sanderson and Butcher create interesting woman characters that have a sizable and important role int their books.  This book reminded more of epic fantasies I read in the 80's and early 90's where it is all about the guys.  There are two woman characters in this book: one is a manipulating flirt, the other is a crazy ex-slave.  Neither of them are interesting and neither of them have a lot of pull in the plot of this book.<br /><br />Overall I didn't like the characters and I thought the plot was boring.  I did like the style of Abercrombie's writing and I did like the action scenes.  When all was said and done; I put down the book and thought \\"Thank God I am done with this, I never want to read about these people ever again!\\"  If you like political novels with unlikable characters and revel in the awful gritty goriness of fight scenes this is the book for you.  I personally like my novels a bit more interesting with characters with greater depth.  I would recommend any of Brandon Sanderson'sbooks ([[ASIN:0765350386 Mistborn : Final Empire Series (Book #1) (Mistborn, Book 1)]]), Robert Jordan's [[ASIN:0812511816 The Eye of the World (The Wheel of Time, Book 1)]] series, Jim Butcher's [[ASIN:044101268X Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)]] series, or Scott Lynch's works ([[ASIN:055358894X The Lies of Locke Lamora]]) over this one.(Book #1) (Mistborn, Book 1)]]), Robert Jordan's [[ASIN:0812511816 The Eye of the World (The Wheel of Time, Book 1)]] series, Jim Butcher's [[ASIN:044101268X Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, Book 1)]] series, or Scott Lynch's works ([[ASIN:055358894X The Lies of Locke Lamora]]) over this one.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I loved Avatar. I liked what it said and how it said it. Big time commentary on how other people's values should never be placed on another species, let alone the same race.<br />Powerful Movie, I recommend  it![[ASIN:0061801267 James Cameron's Avatar: The Na'vi Quest]]
1591391105|5.0|This is one of my two favorite business books.  It is fantastic for anyone entering a new company at any level or moving to a new role/organization within your current company.  Often when we enter a new position, we make mistakes that get us started off on the wrong foot without even realizing it.  This book is essential to understanding how to enter in a way that builds your credibility from Day 1.  I would recommend this to everyone who works.
B000002JSN|5.0|When people think of led zeppelin, this period in their career is usually where people's minds are taken to, Where they were the biggest they could be, their peak if you like. Meaning everything they did was a build up to this album and everything after, heads downwards.<br />  The first disc is probably the hardiest led zeppelin had ever been, but anything with Kashmir is certainly not just hard rock. In fact the first disc is more funky based mostly on hard grooves (obviously coming from  John paul Jones as he loved funk) that even on Trampled Under Foot they incorporate some Clav. The Rover is probably my personal favorite, which I know is odd, but it is just so perfect and that riff OOOHHH it's so emotional!. Most people love Kashmir, with it's dark arabic riff and amazing string arrangement which gives you the feeling that your flying in a helicopter over sandy deserts watching ants scorch to death under the rays of the sun.<br /><br />  The second disc is the heart of the album. In The Light, Bron-Yr-Aur, Down by The Seaside and Ten Years Gone are my favorite part on any led zeppelin album, they're not my favorite tracks, but together they are masterpieces. Bron-Yr-Aur for a start is probably the reason why I rank Jimmy Page so high as a guitarist.<br />  The rest of the album goes a bit rougher with songs like Boogie With Stu that might alienate you at first but after a while you love them like family. The album ends perfectly with Sick Again, which is just so powerful throughout, it always reminds me of Terminator 2 for some reason.<br /><br />  Anyway, get it you won't regret it!

B002BSHWUU|2.0|I live in the U.S. and purchased a used set from Dinosaurmama.  I received a European boxed set and the comp disc with all the mini-docs won't play on my computer.  Fortunately, each individual album's mini-doc does play, for some reason.  And, I have no problems playing the audio tracks, on any type of playback device.  The seller has offered to take the set back for a full refund and I'm weighing that.  Still, I feel the seller should have known of this in advance and not shipped me the Euro version.  I'd like to think this was just an honest mistake.

0525423842|5.0|This is an outstanding tale, especially for teens.  The story itself has a well crafted plot, and most importantly, presents a clear description of how our criminal justice system (is supposed to) work.  All this is accomplished using language that is completely believable, and without profanity, or other objectionable content.  Theo Boone is a 13 year old from a family of lawyers.  As such, he has become thoroughly immersed in the process of the practice of  law.  He has become a legal adviser to his contemporaries and demonstrates this competence time and again by providing accurate counsel to them on a variety of kid type issues.  As such, he became embroiled in a murder case as the go between for an illegal alien witness to the crime, and the legal system.  The resolution of the issues involved is entirely believable and satisfying.  This tale has the potential of becoming the first of a series for the protagonist,  and one that can become the basis for further explaining our system of laws.  It is my profound hope that the author will follow through in a manor similar to that of Ferrol Sams with Theo Boone as an undergraduate in college, law school student, law clerk etc.  All written using language suitable for 13 and up teens.

0307716988|5.0|This was written just as Michael speaks.  As I read it, I heard his voice...simply telling his truth, his story, in his own words.  Sad that his many dreams will never be realized.  This was finished in 1988, at a time when his life was the best and he was on top of his game. It just confirms the sweet, gentle soul that was Michael Jackson and his passion for music, children and making a difference in the world....which he definitely did!  It does give some insight as to why he did certain things...why he thought the way he did.  Michael was a sweet, innocent, tender soul with a heart of gold, and had the potential to do so much more than he was allowed to achieve.  Even then he talks of the media writing lies instead of the truth....he had no idea how horribly bad it was going to get.  Sad that people are so interested in money and creating lies to gain it, that they cared nothing for pure, decent human being that was destroyed in the process.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I purchased this movie for my Father for Father's Day.  He is my Avatar.  He hasn't seen this movie yet and is sure to enjoy it.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|The final season was so rich in story and all the actors, especially O'Quinn and Fox, deliver the performances of their careers. It was sad, beautiful, and ultimately redemptive. There could never be a show like LOST again...quite simply put, it's a work of art and will be sorely missed!
B0039SFKSW|5.0|I'll admit I was disappointed.  But let me be clear on that point:  I was disappointed when I heard that Asia's latest offering was to be called \\"Omega\\".  Yes, Omega, as in the last letter of the Greek alphabet.  Fortunately, it wasn't long before a quote from Mr. Wetton clarified that \\"Omega\\" didn't mean that this was the last--any more than \\"Alpha\\" was the first.  This point was driven home when I received the CD and on the back was a quote from T. S. Elliot, \\"In the end is my beginning\\".    To describe \\"Omega\\" in a single word, it would be \\"energy\\".  There is a power and flow to \\"Omega\\".  There are those drawn to Asia for its collective progressive background that might at first dismiss \\"Omega\\" as a departure from those roots.  That dismissal would be unfortunate.  Yes, \\"Omega\\" shies away from the long \\"epic\\" songs (though I would argue despite its relatively short length, \\"There Was A Time\\" is as epic as it gets for Asia) but what is found here is an extraordinary abundance of quality songs with hooks that tend to stay with you long after the song is over.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Phenomenal!  2 hrs of non-stop Michael Jackson at his best.  Well worth the purchase! For those who love Michael Jackson, you will love this. For those who want to see why Michael Jackson fans are the way they are, watch this DVD. The power of his performance, the love he has for his profession and his fans is palpable.  He was a genius - The GREATEST entertainer of all time!
B002VZC9CY|5.0|First, I'd like to say that everyone who gave this a less than 4 or 5 rating probably isn't a real fan of Miss Merchant's... her voice never sounded better! Further, I was only hesistant because I am usually weary when an established artist only does covers... simply because Natalie has proven time and again that she can write great songs.. plus when I heard she was covering obscure poetry, I was even more hesitant. However, having purchased and enjoyed all her previous releases (especially House Carpenter's Daughter) I bought this anyway. I was VERY pleased... not only are her arrangements superb, the collection is very eclectic musically.. for example, Dancing Bear sounds like a Russian Folk Song, Janitor's Boy could have been played in a 20's Speak-easy, Peppery Man would blend into the New Orleans Jazz Scene and Isabel has a country-bluegrass feel.. If you are truly a Natalie Merchant fan, you will NOT be dissapointed!
0439023491|5.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly.  But I loved the first book Hunger Games More.  Still a great read though.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|My husband and I may be the last two people on this planet, or any other, to see AVATAR.  But after seeing it last night, we agree that AVATAR is the most visually stunning movie ever made.  The colors are saturated and mind blowing; the effects and CGI are breathtaking and seamless; the details are thoughtful and magnificent.  The future tech is credible and amazing.  And the world of Pandora is brilliantly thought out.  The culture, history, and very uniqueness of this alien planet and all her indigenous life forms are completely believable, minutely detailed, and exquisitely rendered; it is a rich civilization whose background and relationships to the world are incredibly developed and enveloping.  The viewer easily becomes a part of this world, drinking in its sights, its sounds, and its people.<br /><br />The only criticism I have of AVATAR is the plot.  The story told in AVATAR may be all dressed up in the most spectacular ball gown ever made, but it is still old, a story we've heard a million times.  It is Lawrence of Arabia; it is Dances with Wolves; it is Pocahontas, to name just a few.  The problem I see is this:  we are what we can imagine.  While there is no doubt that our history tells us that \\"civilized\\" humans have overrun and nearly destroyed indigenous peoples time and time again, there is no reason to suggest that we would do so in our future.  Humans do learn from their mistakes.  One thing science fiction has shown us that we become, we invent, and we seek what we dream.  So if we produce movies and books and TV shows which show us exploring and making friends instead of invading, if we can get over the whole \\"humans bad\\" mentality, then we can achieve a more positive future.  I prefer the future worlds of Star Trek and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, where humans communicate with and learn from aliens rather than attacking them.<br /><br />Overall, I did enjoy AVATAR very, very much, and I would most certainly watch it again.  The fantastic world of Pandora is one to savored and revisited; there is no question about that.  But AVATAR is not an instant classic; rather, it is a film making breakthrough, a technical masterpiece which represents several giant leaps forward in how movies are made, and the standard to which all movies will be held for years to come.ora is one to savored and revisited; there is no question about that.

1596680296|5.0|If you're interested in making socks, this book is a wonderful reference.  It has very clear pictures (actual photographs of stitches and work in progress, not just sketches).  It is not only a pattern book and sock-making instruction book, but, also gives very thorough explanations of the entire sock-knitting process, using a variety of yarn types, not just the usual fingering sock yarn.  I've been knitting for about fifty years and love the book...a great addition to my library!  The book was a very good price at Amazon and arrived in just a few days.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|The books are better, but the TV series is still entertaining in it's own right.  Some network should pick up this show!!
B003BZXI6E|5.0|Barbra has done a lot of memorable things. At 67, I thought she wouldn't be singing anymore. However, this artist shows an immense ability to reinvent herself through minimal innovations that keeps her core talent and personality intact, while adds something entirely new. One Night Only displays that. Her vocal performance is astounding, precise, perfect (not in a perfectionist, obsessive way, as some folks insist that she should do). No, I do not overrate. She is singing live, literally among the audience (due to the reduced size of Village), singing each note, each phrase, everything in a different manner, not completely different from her previous performances, of course, but with something new, something that she had never done before and you cannot quite describe. That`s Barbra's genius. And that is why this show deserves +5 stars. Watch it.
1573229725|2.0|I wish Part 1 had just continued to a logical conclusion. In my opinion, nutty plot-twists don't equal creative writing.
0441013597|5.0|Dune is in a class of its own. Yes it is a sci-fi story, probably the best one ever told, but, as far as sci-fi goes, Dune creates an entirely new category of science-fiction. Dune, for me, was more than a book - it was an experience.
B000I9YLUI|2.0|Very disappointing version of P&P. I felt that the actors were rushed in trying to portray an epic movie and there wasn't the fit seen with the previous actors. The only version that I have seen so far that was by far the most timely and consistent to the book was the BBC A&E 1995 version with Colin Firth and Elizabeth Ehle. Although one person wrote that the ages of the actors (Firth/Ehle) didn't seem to coincide with the characters due to their maturity, one must remember the time period in which Jane wrote. People were far more mature for their ages then they are today and I felt the two fit the maturity given of the times. Also the other characters just didn't fit right either. Given that movies tend to go long nowadays, they could have spent more time/length in this one.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Although Avatar was a great movie in its own right, it was also a message for our own lives on this planet.  It brought to life the complexity of our lives and how we are so closely relying on our planet as well as each other for our survival as a species. What a message in a brillant movie done with innovative style. Loved it.
B002LW9ITY|5.0|This is a great Combo set...A regular DVD as well as a Blue ray DVD. Plus, you also get for this low price two collector Cars as well.     I couldn't resist this great deal and had been waiting for this DVD for months. I even had checked this set in the Department stores. The price in the two department store that, I had went too; were twice the price.    Great Animation...An Awesome DVD to watch!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I waited for Avatar to be available on DVD - we are not huge fans of the movie theatre.    Until it got out on DVD my colleagues have given me a lot of feedback - and not all of it was good: too ecologic, too farfetched, too much \\"green\\" stuff, sectarian (huh?).    So we waited for the DVD with diminishing enthusiasm, but we were in for a great surprise. We absolutely loved it! It is a wonderful story, one that leaves a deep mark in your memory, a vivid memory you can draw upon when you're down. Absolutely amazing - worth every second of you time and every last penny spent on seeing or owning it. As for special effects - I can't think of any other movie to be so visually gratifying.
B00275EHIM|4.0|This was a fun movie! Despite what critics say, this was a very fun movie! Given, you can't take Jake Gylenhaal seriously, but he does well playing The Prince. (Think Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow) While I don't want to fully compare this to many films, it still has elements from many great films. Obviously, it's got an Aladdin feel to it, (An orphan boy who is taken in by royalty, and not that bad with parkour, who meets a beautiful princess. (Who is played by Gemma Arterton, best known for her roles as Agent Fields in Quantum of Solace and Io in Clash of the Titans). It's also somewhat like any number of films about finding ancient artifacts (National Treasure, Indiana Jones).     This is a somewhat predictable film, if you just think of every movie you've seen, you can most likely see the ending by about 40 minutes into the film. That being said, this is not a movie to be passed by. Jake and Gemma are great at acting, Alfred Molina, (Who was Dr. Octopus in Spider-Man 2) plays the comic relief Sheik.) And Ben Kingsley plays the Uncle of the Princes. All are great actors/actresses.         ************SPOILER WARNING****************    The main starter is that Dastan is a young 10ish aged orphan who stops another boy from getting beaten by guards. Then he jumps over rooftops, and does other crazy parkour stuff, just to be caught by the guards. Just before being executed he is rescued by the King of Persia himself. The King takes Dastan in as one of his own sons and so he becomes a Prince of Persia. That's the first 10 minutes or so.    **********END SPOILER WARNING*************        So all in all this is a genuine 3-4 star movie, one to be put on your summer movie list. I loved the film, so did everyone I saw it with. This may not be one to pay over $10 a pop, but the Matinee showtimes are a great way to go for this film. Great acting, but some of the parkour scenes are a little funny as they film it in a Matrix-like way with them moving at slow speed. A great filmall the way, though not one to be taken seriously, just go to the theater in a state of mind of this being a fun, but not too crazy or serious film and you should like it. There are one or two scenes that might be scary to kids, like a guy getting burned by something and people trying to save him, and some action scenes that are a little crazy. Some may find it scary, but I don't know if this warranted a PG-13 rating, well, it may have just barely stepped over that line.
B003EYVXYG|4.0|Don't listen to all the haters out there. This thing was actually a lot more fun then I was expecting it to be. The acting is B-level at best. The CGI gore didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. Ok, the flare gun part was stupid. At least that guy lit his smoke with it so I can look past the crappy effect on that one. It's not like there was a huge budget to work with. Yet, I still gotta give the 70 year-old dude some credit. It has some cool @$$ gore effects going for it right from the get go. The lead actor (from Diary) surprised me with his skills. I hope he gets more work after this. Look, if you hated \\"Diary\\" like most of the world did, don't give up on George just yet. Give this one a shot. If only for the gore filled ending. Was that a spine they pulled out of that guy?
0061478784|4.0|Sophie lives the boring life of an eldest daughter, wiling away her days quietly chatting with the hats she makes for her stepmother. Expecting absolutely no good fortune in her life, Sophie takes things in stride when, seemingly out of the blue, the wicked Witch of the Waste comes into her hat shop and lays a curse on Sophie that transforms her into a creaky old woman. Setting out on her own with no direction in sight, Sophie finds herself offering her services as a cleaning woman for the mysterious Wizard Howl. Enter a whole host of atypical fantasy elements, including a sarcastic fire demon, a vanity-obsessed wizard, a man-dog, and  a strange scarecrow, and Howl's Moving Castle (yes, the castle actually does move) is a refreshingly original fantasy story.     Sophie is a likable heroine and while I was a little worried I would have trouble connecting with her as an old woman, this wasn't a problem at all. The romance, while predictable and ok, was the only piece that didn't quite fit. Aside from that, my only wish is that there had been a little more edge-of-your-seat action, which there really wasn't much. Instead, this is a story that happily moves along at its own not too fast but not too slow pace. Surprisingly, all of the unique elements worked beautifully in this fun book that really is in a class of its own.
B00275EHIM|5.0|So, I just came from the movie P of P and was delighted with the entire film. Prince Dastan looked good enough to bed as well as displaying those manly talents most mythic heros are obliged to possess these days. The action was, well relentless and the princess almost as beautiful as she was in \\"St. Trinians\\".  Who said she was fat??  The CGI was great as it was not overdone, choppy, and slap dash, it just flowed with the film.  Very good.  The story was simple with a bit of a tweak.  Just right with some loop holes and lagging logic, but so much fun compared to COTT (remake). I liked the fact that the romance @ the end of the movie is actually a courtship to develop, perhaps a nod in the direction of sequal.  My movie mate didn't fall asleep either, which he usually does, but stayed eyed to the action.  Yes, I wil buy this moviewhen it comes out. I rejected COTT.
0393075966|5.0|This is an excellent, highly readable survey of the global financial crisis that resulted from the implosion of unregulated derivatives based on mortgages and other forms of credit.  Stiglitz examines the neoclassical econmic assumptions that set the stage for this catastrophe and blinded the likes of Greenspan and Rubin to what was happening.  He examines the Bush-Obama rescue and stimulus plans.  But mostly he takes a long view on the measures that are needed to achieve a healthly balance between the roles of government and private corporations and to build a new economy. At a time when we are surrounded by anti-government, anti-debt, anti-regulation tea party madness that could still sink this damaged ship, Stiglitz reprsents a lonely voice of reason and sanity.
B001VNVRVQ|5.0|Bought this book as a required read for my daughter's Language & Composition class. The book is well written and easy to get lost in; an excellent read.
0061689246|3.0|Stardust is one of those rare occurrences where the movie outshines the book. The book was poorly written and uneven, with too much detail in some areas that became boring and then just sped through other scenes that had so much potential. Luckily the movie cut the boring scenes and expanded the good-but-glossed-over scenes. The characters were also very dull, two-dimensional, and annoying. The star was bratty, but not in an endearing or funny way and Tristram was just kind of dull. I also preferred the character tweaks the movie made, particularly making Victoria snotty and spoiled.<br /><br />I can't knock the book too much, though. A lot of the things I loved about the movie were straight from the book, like the set up with the brothers and how all the characters' stories led them to the star. In that sense, I'd give Stardust the book full marks for originality, but only partial marks for execution. The movie fares much better in both regards, because while it took many ideas from the book, it also came up with a lot of original parts (the captain's personality, the entire ending) and the execution was worlds better than that of the book. Overall, I was disappointed with this book but very thankful it inspired such a great movie.<br /><br />I'm not sure who to recommend this book to, as it's written in a very simplistic, childish manner that is sort of boring for adults, but there's a pretty smutty sex scene in there (which I thought was pretty unnecessary). Actually, if anyone asked, I'd probably tell them to skip the book and watch the movie instead. Rating is really more 2 and 1/2 stars.
B00004YA66|3.0|This is about the most peculiar movie I have ever seen. Just weird. For those who loved it so much, I don't get it. For the few that hated it, I don't get that either. I am truly at a loss for words about this one. So I'll just leave it at that. *Still shaking my head.*
B0036B8MXC|5.0|When I first started watching this I thought, as a lot of other people do, that this was just a corny copycat of 300 and gladiator with more blood and longer sex scenes. But when I watched a few more episodes (its on Netflix watch instantly online) I came to see more plot developing and got more involved with the characters. One of the things I like most about this show is that people die off pretty randomly to the point that I am actually some what surprised when it happens. They really hammer in the setting of Rome being a brutal place which is also what I think makes the show excellent. If you didn't like 300 or gladiator because of the language, violence, or other graphic scenes you defiantly won't approve of the scenes in Spartacus.

B00001QEE9|5.0|I loved the movie Pinocchio since when I was 7 and I still love this movie. Pinocchio is my favorite character in this film. I hate Honest John he is evil. Geppetto shold've told Pinocchio not to talk to strangers. Pinocchio changed his mind that he doesn't want to be an actor and decides to listen to his father.  I totally recommend this film any Classic Disney fan. Pinocchio and Bambi are my top favorite disney classics.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|This was an insult to the US market.  Not to have David Attenborough narrate the US version is disgusting.  It would be one thing if he hadn't been available, but to have him and not provide the US audience with his consummate talent was an extremely poor decision.  I had been looking forward to this show for months.  After hearing Oprah Winfrey for 10 minutes, I simply turned the channel and began my wait for the real version.    Whoever made this decision should be caned.
B002ZG996I|4.0|So, it's a Rom-Com, park reality at the door and enjoy the cartoon credits at the beginning.    Alex is a staggeringly handsome man, and my following him since the days of Moonlight brought me to watch this film.  He does comedy as well as he does \\"angsty Vampire\\".  PLUS, sun doesn't bother this buff and cut goat farmer/cheese maker.    I can take small doses of JLo, yet I will say she does her best.  She needs to get some meatier rolls because at 40 (almost 41) she needs to do something other than this lightweight stuff.    Get a bottle of wine, a quart of chunky monkey and enjoy the movie!    I nominate this for the \\"Hottest Scene involving a Pillow\\" in a PG 13 movie.

1597801585|2.0|Windup Girl was awarded the Nebula by 1,500 professional sci-fi authors.  Why is a mystery to me.  Okay its novel in that it's set in Thailand, but what a place, everyone is corrupt, brutal, murderous or all three.  There are even inscrutable Chinese, in short, the white man's third world hell.  Can this be new? In this world, seemingly three generations before, oil...contracted, or something, and everything collapsed (except in Japan - another new theme). Then the seas rose, and then genetic plagues swept the world destroying eggplants. Okay, so eco-caust, another tried and true theme.  BUT this one is special, because (I'm guessing here) it completely destroyed ALL solar cells, and apparently re-wrote human memory so no one knows how to make them, or even recalls they existed (becuase there aren't any). So we have evil corporate agri-business tycoons (another tried and true theme) riding around in \\"coal diesel\\" limos. I guess hydrogen got eliminated too, or something. And street lights powered by methane, or coal, and mutant elephants powering factories and...its all just too dippy.       Our heroine (windup girl) is a genehack geisha with some Labrador retriever bits, her weird give away geisha moves, as well a major neurotic issues, as in being her own worst enemy.  Besides being illegal to where the Thais want to exterminate her, until, but who cares. This thing is a slog.       A far superior vision of a new country (and multi-narrator structure) is found in, say, Cyberbad Days which actually allows people (not inscrutable ones) some room to have feelings, think about stuff, and do things that make sense to themselves.  Wait for the paperback and buy it used.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|I agree with everything said in the previous 1 star reviews. Earlier seasons wove a plot full of intellectually stimulating mysteries, with the producers explicitly promising resolutions. It was the reason the majority of people were watching, with the growing culture of speculation in anticipation of the answers the primary reason for the show's success (a simple castaway soap opera wouldn't have lasted 2 seasons).<br /><br />Season 6 could have been the amazing if it had concentrated on resolving the first 5. Instead they did an about face and copped out, taking the laziest, most anti-intellectual path they possibly could have gotten away with. Season 6 was for the most part an answer-free punch in the gut, wasting 1/2 the season on the flash sideways which in the end had zero relevance to anything on the island, even though it was stuffed full of red herrings indicating it would. The generic religious finale, contrived solely to reunite couples for a schmultzy \\"happy\\" ending was (relative to intellectual potential) EASILY the worst in the history of television. In the end the producers turned out to be nothing but con men, throwing mysteries at viewers to keep them watching, claiming there was a purpose to them, then doing an about face claiming the show was always only about the characters and the mysteries didn't matter.<br /><br />As a huge fan of the first 5 seasons it wouldn't have taken much from S6 to get me to buy the set on blu-ray. Now there is no point. Thanks to the unbelievably disappointing ending and knowing the irrelevance of it all I will not even be able to enjoy watching reruns on TV. I cannot imagine a worse, more lazy ending. In all seriousness it would have been better if the whole series had turned out to be Jack's dream.

B002IDDRT8|5.0|I was bored today, trying to stay out of trouble, and I found this movie. I was a bit apprehensive as I had never heard of this film. After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a shot. I was very impressed. It was similar to Beowulf but not so much that it lost its individuality. Engaging action, inspiring cinematography, believable characters, heart, some humor, and of course a beautiful woman. Elements, that when properly blended, make for an enjoyable film.

B000002LUB|5.0|Those metal fans that haven't heard this album, probably have nothing to do with a metal at all. Black Sabbath gained a particularly new, heavy sound during Ronnie James Dio era. The album was recorded in 1992 and was seriously underrated. It would take several years until the world will be ready for that sort of sound! While the typical Sabbath's style is clearly obvious in riffs created by great trio Iommi/Butler/Appice, Dio vocals have brought fantastic power to the band that was missing during Ozzy time. Not to mention the lyrics that bring you to the world of contemporary magic and evil.<br /><br />\\"Computer god\\" starts with characteristic for Black Sabbath powerfull riff and continuous with the story of the battle with new evil, surronding us.<br />\\"After All\\" kicks off with a doom riff that is followed by tremendous voice of Ronnie. The whole song is the story that deeps you inside fate, death and evil.<br />\\"TV crimes\\" fast heavy metal song enriched with riffs and great solos. Vinny Appice drum work is great!<br />\\"Letters from Earth\\" was the single I first heard from the album. The slow song so greatly featuring Dio power vocals allows him to tell the truth of the life, here on Earth. He brings the questions, that maybe even shouldn't be answered.<br />\\"Master of Insanity\\" is one of the most great songs in the album that has so great melodic part and fantastic rhythm section, with kicking ass solos.<br />\\"Time Machine\\" recorded twice with a slight differences in the album is a straight forward heavy metal song that brings a lot of power and speed to the whole Dehumanizer work. Once again, Dio's lyrics bring a lot of things to think about! Enjoy the magic!<br />\\"Sins of the father\\" a song that is quite hard to listen for those ones who are more with an early \\"Heaven and Hell\\" Black Sabbath era. The song is tremendously heavy starting with rather slow doom riff and continuing with fast second part.<br />\\"Too late\\" is one of those great gifts we were ever wishing to have from the Masters! Slow and melodic, with Dio voice appealing to the deep human feelings! The song is as great for its composition as the \\"Don't Talk To Strangers\\" is.<br />\\"I\\" - really strong thing! Played a lot live it is one of their favorities probably. Powerfull riff by Iommi/Butler, fast drum rhythm section by Appice and the legendary voice of Dio.<br />\\"Buried alive\\" is also very hard song for those who are not well prepared=) The bass part is fantasticly great. Butler really kicks off with a great solo parts. Iommi's solo in the middle of the song is as usually great and melodic.<br /><br />Overall the album is really strong and powerfull! Metalheads of all time will like it. Strong line up and great era!nd melodic, with Dio voice appealing to the deep human feelings! The song is as great for its composition as the \\"Don't Talk To Strangers\\" is.  \\"I\\" - really strong thing! Played a lot live it is one of their favorities probably.

B002HWRYJE|3.0|I was a fan of the original \\"Star Trek\\" but I wouldn't characterize myself as a Trekkie.  I saw most of the episodes but I never read the novelizations or attended a convention.  The charm of the original was they were on a limited budget so they had to compensate with imaginative stories that contained wit and humor.  I'll be forever grateful to \\"Trek\\" for providing me with one of my pubescent objects of desire, Uhura (Nichelle Nichols).  When the movies came out they were something of a mixed bag.  The better ones, \\"Wrath of Khan\\" and \\"The Voyage Home\\" had great stories in contrast to the weaker ones \\"Star Trek-The Motion Picture\\" and the one Shatner directed whose title escapes me.  Alas, J.J. Abrams effort falls into the same trap as the worst Trek movies by compensating visuals and sound for story.  Maybe that was deliberate because the story here is rather slight.  There are things to recommend here notably in the films quieter moments the new actors(Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, et al) acquit themselves well in the parts so strongly identified with others.  Leonard Nimoy's abbreviated screen time brightens up the screen suggesting that this old dog knows what made \\"Star Trek\\" an institution.  This effort will not kill future installments, as it's box office demonstrated, but there is a lot of room for improvement.

B0039SFKSW|5.0|I really like this CD!  It isnt quite the classic prog style of their early albums, but it has some really good songs.  It's more pop/rock & roll songs (ballads) than the compositions Asia did in the early days like Heat Of The Moment, etc.  Most of Asia later albums I have a hard time getting through the whole album.  But this was an exception.  The songs are really well written musically, catchy and harmonic.  Now that I've heard it off LaLa, I will but this one.  I've only purchased 4 of their other albums, so it's saying a lot what i think of this one!  5 stars!

1584282584|5.0|Sometimes, a book hits on something that you didn't know you knew, but that opened up a whole new world to you. I bought this book because on-camera flash photography is something I do a lot of at family functions.  I knew enough going in to bounce it off a wall or a ceiling or something, but needed to fine tune it.  This book put everything into perfect perspective for me, showing me not only what I already knew, but framing it in such a way that everything else quickly fell into place.<br /><br />So, yeah, this book delivers exactly what it promises, and gives you a lot of detail without overwhelming you.  Using what you learned in this book on your next shoot will definitely give you better results!
0345349571|5.0|I owe a lot to Ms. Tuchman. You see, for five years I had conducted extensive research into the Knights Templar, and had a big gap:\\"the feel\\" of what it was like to live back then. My story [[ASIN:061526431X THE TEMPLARS, TWO KINGS, AND A POPE]]takes place between 1293-1315,and I found that A Distant Mirror gave me all I wanted to know about what it was like to be a knight, or a peasant, or a nobleman in those troubling days. I wanted to know what people ate, what they wore, what someone like me would read, think and want out of life.<br /><br />I learned all that from Barbara Tuchman, but also that while the 14th century saw the beginning of the 100-year war and the first wave of the black plague, it also saw tremendous advances. For the first time books were being mass-produced by guilds of scribes, which made them accessible. The knowledge that the Arabs acquired from the books at the Library of Alexandria in the 4th century was percolating back to Europe. Sewers and piped water were being built in Paris, and scholars at its university were learning about Algebra, medicine, and astronomy. They would also learn how to make cement all over again.<br /><br />That's when Marco Polo's account of his travels came out, and people learned about the black stones the Chinese burned in place of charcoal or wood. But perhaps of equal import, gunpowder entered warfare and made walled cities and armor obsolete.<br /><br />A Distant Mirror did a good job of corroborating a key element in my book, and it's that the kings of France had concocted a scheme to conquer the world, all they needed was a large army, a compliant pope, the defeat of the English king, and to get rid of the Templars. I found what I had called \\"the French Scheme\\"  still alive in Ms. Tuchman's pages, and it was all the validation I needed.<br /><br />I also learned about Marguerite Poret and the Beguines, another case of a secret Gnostic practice and how the Church dealt with such. The Templars had their own Gnostic society, The Brotherhood,(secret until the 1600's) but they managed to survive.<br /><br />I enjoyed Ms. Tuchman's scholarship and writing so much, that since then I have read her account of WWI and her excellent biography of General Joe Stillman which told me so much about modern China.od,(secret until the 1600's) but they managed to survive.

B002ZBTWL0|5.0|I had never heard Attila until a few months ago, when the Met aired Riccardo Muti's performance on their Saturday broadcast. I immediately set out to find a recording, and did the obvious thing, buying the Muti CD on EMI with the La Scala orchestra, with Cheryl Studer as Odabella, Samuel Ramey as Attila, Neil Shicoff as Foresto, and Giorgio Zancanaro as Ezio. The recording dates from 1989 and was all round better musically than the Met broadcast. No complaints!    It was my learning that there was a live recording with Mara Zampieri conducted by Sinopoli that led me to buy a second recording a month or so later.  A few years ago I had never heard of her, but because I admired Sinopoli's Strauss and Mahler I thought I would try out his Verdi, and bought his Macbeth. And that's how I discovered this great singer. She does not disappoint as Odabella. It was Sinopoli's debut at the Vienna State Opera; he was only 34 at the time, and it made him a star overnight. The audience is wildly enthusiastic, and with good reason. This recording has a sense of occasion that provides the extra frisson. Attila might be considered minor Verdi--he was only 33 when he wrote it--but I find it irresistible, a work of genius, even if not fully formed. Good as Muti is, I wouldn't be without Sinopoli's  great recording. Both are highly recommended.
081243238X|5.0|This is a \\"calm-me-down\\" book; a \\"getting ready for sleep\\" book. I have read this book countless times. Children find the text slow and comforting. They seem to find comfort in the clear,uncluttered illustrations. They have seen the same views from their own windows and seem to find peace as the text is read. There is no exciting story and no tremendous message or lesson, but what there is is a readiness for sleep and the assurance that all is well.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Even though I already had it on DVD, I couldn't pass up an opportunity to get The Dark Knight on blu-ray at such a low, low bargain basement price. The film, in general, is just amazing. Getting over Christian Bale's wretched Batman voice, there are very few flaws with the film. The blu-ray is a must buy, even if you already own the DVD.

B00102F5WK|5.0|This truly was a great movie showing what is wrong with torture and the current U.S. policy of illegal torture and rendition. If you want to know what is really going on in the world, then this is a movie for you. Torturing someone who is innocent will, in turn, get false confessions. This movie shows you how an innocent man tortured enough will confess to anything in order to make the torture stop. We have a lot of problems in the world and kidnapping people and shipping them off to be tortured in other countries is very despicable. If someone is really guilty then they should be tried and convicted; instead, we torture them in an unknown location and we get many false confessions. This truly was a powerful movie. I highly recommend this to anyone. The people who control our government are out of control and extremely criminal. They do not care about the truth or justice. As a side note: most of the major terrorist attacks, if you study them, have been carried out by quite a few of the various countries themselves. Research false-flag terror and you will get an idea for what i am saying.
B0038QGXHW|5.0|The less appealing elements of Jarrett's music are gone here, same with Haden.  All that remains is a shining classic. Sublime music, superbly played, and fabulously recorded.
B002VPE7AQ|5.0|Great Young Adult novel.  Despite the major differences between the 2 main characters: miss cheerleader, popular USA, and gang banger, bad boy-they find similarities together that leads to an unexpected relationship.  The plot of this story keeps the reader engaged in the story.  I like the chemistry aspect in that the 2 main characters are partnered in a Chemistry class for a project and then there ends up being personal chemistry between them.

Rich orchestration, great writing and as always: brilliant playing.       Largo remains my favorite recording from Mehldau- as it's truly groundbreaking and inventive.  Highway Rider could be my favorite now, I won't know for a few months as there is so much here to dig in to and digest.   There is a lot to take in here, all of it worth your time.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|I must be the last person on Earth to see this movie.  After seeing it, I totally understand why it is the highest grossing film in history.  It's a spectacular tour de force, with breathtaking special effects and a story that resonates.  The acting in films like this is usually rote at best, but the two lead actors really made you believe their bond.  Really, I could go on about the story, but I'm sure anybody reading this has already seen this fantastic movie.  All im left to say is; is this guy James Cameron great, or what?!!
B0025KW29U|5.0|Most everyone seems to agree that this movie is great. The Blu-ray is even better. The picture quality is really good. Much better then the DVD version I had watched previously (through Netflix). It is also loaded with extras. \\"Commentary! The Musical\\" is a really funny musical version of a typical DVD commentary (Whedon's humor is all through it). It is almost like having a whole new movie.
B0036EH3X4|2.0|Well after all these years of clever twists, they ended the show with the same ending from Titanic?  Yikes.    Season 1 was fresh if long winded.  Season 2 ran into a road block of nonsense.  Season 3 turned the tide with an amazing finale.  Season 4 was a great beginning to the end.  And season 5 made great, if overextended, use of time travel. Save amazing episodes like Dr. Linus and Ab Aeterno, there was precious little to save Season 6 from mediocrity.      Overall, I strongly feel the series went one season too many.  A slightly longer season 5 with a couple less filler episodes easily could have taken on this story concept and closed the overall character arcs.  I didn't hate season 6 at all.  But I didn't like it very much either.  A laugh out loud explanation for the \\"sideways\\" flushed it for me.    Long live Hurley, Ben, Desomond and Richard, but after the downslide in this last series of episodes, I'm sad to see it go, but after flash sideways, thank god it's over.

0385504225|3.0|This is a typical Dan Brown novel, with secret codes and puzzles laid over a classic thriller style mystery. There are the expected pursuits, narrow escapes, and mysterious secrets and conspiracies. I'm not knowledgeable enough to review the science or the history in this story, I don't know how much is science and how much is psuedoscience, but the premise is, as in all Brown's Books, intriguing.  Personally I like it as much as The DaVinci Code, but not quite as much as Angels and Demons, which is still my favorite of the Robert Langdon stories. The Lost Symbol is a fast, fun read with a plot twist at the end that the careful reader may or may not see coming.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Ordered this as soon as I saw it for release. Only been waiting 9 years ;) (UK fans, you will need a multi-region dvd player, or a laptop with interchangable region settings, delivery doesn't take too long, but you will have a customs charge to pay before you can pick it up.)  Solely having this dvd boxset makes it 5 stars, there are flaws however, but I guess if you're a major Daria fan, it won't be the end of the world.  The packaging is... pants to say the least. The box, the cover art, the lack of episode guide.  I'm not sure if it's just my copy but i have quite an obvious audio/visual sync delay (the characters mouths move way before the start talking)  There's the obvious lack of music, but most people won't really care too much about that.  Other than that. I'm just chuffed to finally have it on dvd, to watch whenever I like :)

B000TPZJNE|5.0|I acquired my first copy of DSOTM in 1982 on Harvest (EMI) records.  While I had the pleasure of hearing this record on a Thorens TD-126 MK II, McIntosh C-26 Preamp, McIntosh MC2015 Power Amp and Bose 901s, I really didn't come to appreciate how amazing it sounded until i had the misfortune of playing that same record on a much more inferior AIWA system I got for college.  When the CD era really took over, I had the good fortune of acquiring it again on the now legendary EMI-Japan black disc.  The sound was great but I still lacked the equipment to appreciate the differences between CD and Vinyl.  I then acquired the EMI 20th Anniversary edition remastered domestically.  Nice packaging and decent sound.  I bought it again when it came out on CD/SACD a few years ago for $10.  Well.... amazingly my own system has now made it to a high enough level...McIntosh... that I can appreciate the differences between vinyl and CD having bought this 30th Anniversary edition on vinyl.  WOW.  Everything that the likes of Neil Young have been saying about vinyl for years I can finally appreciate.  Get the vinyl ... but make sure you have the equipment to enjoy it.
B0038QGXHW|5.0|I am not particularly a fan of Charlie Haden - he's played on a few classic albums, but for the most part, I do not consider him to be one of the double-bass greats. Keith Jarrett, on the other hand, is a true living legend. Jasmine is their first collaboration in over 30 years, and was recorded in 2007 at Jarrett's small home studio. They spent much time listening to and discussing the recorded results, and have just now released it to their devoted followings. Some will immediately be reminded of the albums Bill Evans recorded late in his life with Eddie Gomez, but Jasmine is something entirely different (and is not to compare the radically different styles of two jazz piano giants).    \\"Art is dying in this world, and so is listening, as the world becomes more full of toys and special effects,\\" writes Jarrett in the liner notes. \\"With this death will come the undoing of many possible feelings: beautiful, tender, deep, trusting, true, sad, full of internal meaning and color.\\" This proclamation is the best possible description of this album, and the music contained within throws down the gauntlet against the rising tide of shallowness and superficiality. Similar to 1999's The Melody at Night, with You (a solo set of standards Jarrett recorded when he was recovering from chronic fatigue syndrome), there is a big-sky spaciousness married to a simple spontaneity in these recordings that is completely unlike anything else being produced today.    In the interest of full disclosure, it should be stated that Jarrett's infamous vocalizations do make occasional appearances on this album, but do not distract from the overall impressions generated. The opener, \\"For all we know\\" features an emphatic solo by Haden and the classic gospel piano tones/transcendent codas that have become Jarrett's trademark. The bluesy \\"Where can I go without you\\" moves leisurely, and the uptempo \\"No Moon at all\\" demonstrates that this album will not become a soundtrack to a flickering candle in the darkness. \\"One day I'll fly away\\" is played straightforwardly, with an ethereal close. The two longest tracks, \\"I'm gonna laugh you right out of my life\\" and \\"Body and Soul\\" provide the nearest reminiscences of Jarrett's fiery soloing. The former includes a composed intro and ascending piano chords over a Gary Peacock-ish solo, while the latter moves at walking tempo before Haden plays his most masterly break yet. On the poignant \\"Goodbye\\", darker timbres come into play, and \\"Don't ever leave me\\" becomes the perfect summation of all that's come before.    Jasmine is a much more joyful, forward-looking album than The Melody at Night, with You. There are no ecstaticly hip solos or unevenly played tunes, and the time-honored ECM sound (and typefaces) are ever-present. While thought-provoking throughout, at 62:56, it never once allows the listener's attention to wander. As Jarrett approaches 50 years of professional recording, it must be confessed that we do not know who will be listening to jazz 50 years from now. Jasmine, however, will stand the test of time and will be enjoyed and appreciated for many years to come. Instant classic!
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I loved SATC2. I have the entire collection seasons 1-6 and the first movie. I think it was better than the first one. I thought Samantha was HILARIOUS. One thing that I will say that I didn't like is that Harry, Steve, and Smith or Aidan weren't in it very much. I just knew Samanthan and Smith would at least hook up. I was kinda hoping Samantha and Smith would get back together. I'm a big Aidan fan and I always thought he was better for Carrie. But anyway, I like the fact that it was different and it took everyone out of their shell so to speak. Charlotte was finally shown to not be so perfect all the time and that even though she always wanted to be a mother and loves her children, does need a break sometimes too. I thought it was great that Miranda made a better life for herself. All in all it was a great movie. I'd see it again and probably will in a few days:)
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I've always liked Natalie Merchants unique musical style, but this takes the cake. Even though the songs are transcribed from childrens poetry, this is some of her most sophisticated and artistic work in my opinion. Whimsical, catchy, and quality literary content. what more can you ask for? I also really enjoyed the detailed extras that came with the discs. She provided biographical information about each author she co wrote her songs with. there were even picures to go along with it! I recommend this to anyone.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|The writers of this epic TV series took the cheap way out, giving us it was all a dream plot twist that would get most writers a rejection slip and kick out of the editor's office.  The series should have ended after Season Five, with Juliet's successful explosion of the Nuke, followed by a brief epilogue.  A little thought after getting over the cheap emotions of the finale's reunion of lovers will give everyone pause - the story and plot simply made no sense as there were too many obviously unanswered questions.  Oh, but it was just Jack's nano-second of post death experience.  Who cares, then, what happenned if it was Jack's dream.<br /><br />A better ending would have been to use the sideways flashes to legitimize what Juliet did in the Season Five finale.  That was the alternate world created by her successfully exploding the Nuke and changing time in the process.  And the reunions could have been the door opening to the world of Lost that went on in some parallel universe unknown to the sideways characters. That would have at least given some rationale for the sideways world. And Jack still could have died, but in the reality of the parallel universe instead of in a plane crash.<br /><br />Fire the writers of sig the smoke monster on them.

1590171993|4.0|I am on a roll reading NYRB \\"Classics\\" and though I've only read three I haven't been disappointed in a singe one. My ten-year-old daughter doesn't understand--she said yesterday how silly they seem. \\"One's a bout a boring man (\\"Stoner\\") and an ugly girl (\\"Skylark'') and some woman who thinks her husband is a painting.\\" (\\"Wish her safe at home\\").     She's right in that the plots are hardly riveting, but the way the stories are told may be the element that gives them the NYRB \\"Classic\\" tag. \\"Stoner\\" really is about a boring man but maybe its attraction is that most of us are boring, caught in the relentless routine of life and presented with a few opportunities that we rarely have the energy to exploit, and so there is a certain unsettling empathy that you have with him.     Per chance, along side this book, I've been reading Ayn Rand's \\"The Art of Fiction\\". I think she would have hated this book. She famously (or infamously) comes from a deterministic view, where \\"heros\\" make their mark on the world and if the world makes its mark on them instead (As in Stoner's case--as in most of our cases.) then it is simple feminine weakness and hardly worth writing about. (She has some excellent writing tips so I wouldn't dismiss her writing book even if you happen to disagree with her world view.)     If \\"Stoner\\" does have a shortcoming it is the one that Rand would find unforgiveable--he is too weak a man. I think I became frustrated with Stoner when the well-being of his beloved daughter was at stake and yet he didn't interfere with his frigid wife's treatment of her. But the real question is: Was his reaction unrealistic? As I thought about it (And of the men of his generation and even the generation after.) I realized that the sad thing about the scene is that it does ring true.    And there in lies the power of the book--the weaknesses in us all that it exposes rings horribly true.
B002OVEB5S|5.0|If you are a true slayer fan then I'm sure you don't need to read a review of this album. You probably heard this album within the first 2 weeks of release. If you are new to Slayer then I suggest you listen to the first few albums first. Afterwards, buy this album; however, like a previous reviewer had stated, stay clear of the dvd version. It's just a waste of money. You can watch it for free via youtube and their myspace page. Save your money and get the regular version.
0307473708|2.0|This is a rare instance. I generally love a book if I like a movie or tv show that is derived from that book, but not this time. It took me about 2+ weeks to get through this book. I'm really glad that it was written (and the rest of them as well) otherwise we wouldn't have Dexter on tv. Perhaps if I had never seen the show, I might have enjoyed the book....
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I just saw Avatar yesterday.  I have to say it definately impressed me.  Before I saw it, I knew that it had a lot of computer animation in it and part of me was saying that this is gonna be a crappy attempt to make that next generation movie because everything would look fake.  The other part of me was saying that this was also the most expensive movie ever made and there's a reason why.  So not being able to decide what I thought it would be like, I watched it.  It blew me away at how detailed and vibrant the animation was.  The avatars even had similar facial features to that of their human controlling them.  The voices and sounds of the people and the jungle were life like.  I couldn't believe that everything would look so real.  This shows me where all the money went.    Another thing that I really liked was the themes of the movie.  The humans were actually the bad guys in this one.  They came to the plantet, Pandora, to mine unobtanium (which is funny because it suggests that it is unobtainable).  It sells for $20 million a kilo or something and all they are trying to do it get as much as they can.  The Navi, however, see life through the eyes of nature.  Every plant and animal on Pandora is connected and so are everyone of the Navi people.  They live in harmony and it is amazing how it hints at true spirituality.  This theme is that money should not be the center of your life and that spiritual things are much more sustaining. Another theme I liked was that everyone of the Navi could plug into each other, animals, and trees just like plugging a cord into a computer and syncing.  It suggests that there is one mind and that all are connected no matter how different.  This is very similar to some religions today and I found it very interesting that they combined spirituality into an action movie on another planet.    Definately watch this movie!!  It is probably the best movie I've ever seen.  The graphics and sound quality is superb and would be twice as goodon blu-ray with surround sound.  But let me warn you, the version that is out now on DVD is only the movie, in November or December of this year a compete edition will come out that will have all the bonus features and what not.  Wait until then if you can to buy it.  But don't wait until then to watch it!  Rent it or if you've got deep pockets buy it now and then buy the second edition later.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.  Hardly any blood, a few obsenities, and a lot of good suspense.  Not to mention the ties with nature and god.  5 stars all the way!

B000E9910W|5.0|This is without a doubt the best greatest hits collection of the Doobie Brothers.  It includes the Patrick Simmons and Michael McDonald eras.  Both were high quality eras, and the sound is tremendous.  Memories just flooded back from childhood listening to these hits.  Any dance I went to in the '70's had to include \\"Long Train Running\\", and it sounds great here.  If you are a fan of the Doobie Brothers, this is THE collection for you.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|I absolutely love this cd. You never have to hit the fast forward button. I used to be able to do that with a Keane cd until the last two efforts have left me searching for music I enjoy. This music relaxes you and makes you feel good. Love the piano, love the words and just the over all feeling of it. I hope their next effort follows in the same vein and does not veer off the road as many other tend to do with their third cd. Good job boys!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002RAREAK|4.0|I love how the title of this album relates to Usher's impending divorce with Tameka Raymond. Slick move, Usher. Slick move, my brother. Usher has never released a bad album, period. All of his works are solid, so he has set a bar for himself because so many artists aren't this consistent. \\"Raymond v. Raymond\\" is no exception; I'm impressed. This album has a futuristic feel to it, but that's all right because the futuristic sound usually makes an album distinctive.<br /><br />Usher calls upon some top notch producers for this album. Here we have Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis and Polow the Don, among others. Released to radio were \\"Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)\\", \\"O.M.G.\\", \\"Lil' Freak\\", \\"There Goes My Baby\\" and \\"Papers.\\" Now, this many songs released to radio is a sign that the album is successful because record companies are not going to continue to send music from an album if no one is listening to it or enjoying it. \\"Papers\\" is the only song which speaks directly about his impending divorce. It can be painful to listen to because the tone in his voice is emotional and it hurts to hear him say that he \\"damn near lost his mamma.\\" \\"O.M.G.\\" is a catchy number, a track that seems to be more so for the younger generation. I like it, though, as do many of my peers who are also in their twenties. I like what Usher did with \\"Make Love (Into the Night.) He remade the song, but changed the lyrics and the outcome is a fine one.<br /><br />Add this album to your collection. I was entertained and think you will be, too.<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. \\"Make Love (Into the Night)\\"<br />2. \\"Lil' Freak\\"<br />3. \\"There Goes My Baby\\"<br />4. \\"Mars vs. Venus\\"<br />5. \\"Papers\\"

B002ZG98VE|3.0|In Ridley Scott's \\"Robin Hood\\" the legend is given a new and updated backstory, which presumably took place prior to Robin's outlaw days in Sherwood Forest.  Whether the new backstory is was needed or not, I'm not sure. But on the other hand the nature of Robin Hood has always been to re-interpret and expand upon the legend....      Robin Hood has long been tied to King \\"Richard the Lion Hearted\\" as an ally of Richard's.   In the lastest \\"Robin Hood,\\" Robin is now specifically made a part of Richard's return from the Crusades, Richard's skirmishes in France, and King John's (who followed Richard) battles in fighting off a French invasion.  Robin is also given a possibly quirky or unexpected back-story of how he came to be known as `Robin of Locksley.\\"    The movie goes back and forth pretty well between decent drama and good action. Also, according to the History Channel Show \\"The Real Robin Hood,\\" attention in the movie is paid to authentic battle mail, costumes, weapons, and battle techniques of the period. The movie features overall solid performances from Crowe and Blanchett; and the supporting roles include William Hurt and the legendary Max Von Sadow.  Although it's a new take on the Robin Hood legend it's not necessarily a strikingly original movie - it's a bit of a mix-mash of movies like Braveheart, Gladiator, and others and features one dimensional villains - but that's not always a bad thing at the movies!  The latest incarnation of \\"Robin Hood\\" may not be an absolute \\"must-see\\" but it's entertaining and if you're in the mood for kings, knights, battles, and tales from \\"jolly ole- England\\" it's worth at the very least a rental.
0525423842|2.0|Disappointing... on several levels...     When I first heard Grisham was doing a YA novel, I thought here's a chance to have a riveting crime fiction tale from one of the best in the page-turner business...     Here's what I found:     1. 100 pages to get to any riveting drama... he's lost 98% of my students by then... it does get interesting for about 80-100 pages with a lot of promise but fizzle...     2. Dated characters... Theodore reads like a Encyclopedia Brown impersonation... since when do 13 year olds not date... the two female characters are very brief walkon stereotypes... the witness ditto...     3. After finally getting to the meat of the story, nothing happens... the ending is beyond anticlimactic, offers no real resolution and clearly just setting up a sequel... there is no danger... there is barely the tiniest hint of danger... the book just ends...     So will I be purchasing this book for our media center? No. Disappointed.
B002ZG983M|4.0|Dark Comedy through and through. Even if the movie is about superheroes and stars kids, it most definately is not for children. Make no mistake: it is rated R for a reason. If you let your kids see this: it's YOUR fault, not theirs.<br /><br />The movie is obviously geared towards us proud comicbook geeks who have wondered what might happen if one were to strap on a cape and beat up badguys (nothing good that's what). The hero learns the hard way that being a superhero is not all its cracked up to be and underneath the tights and utility belts they're alone and miserable. If anything the movie is a parable and object lesson to anyone considering doing the same thing.<br /><br />Although starring Nicholas Cage and others, they're all upstaged by an 11 year old. Hit Girl (newcommer Georgia native Chloe Moretz)steals the show. Her scenes are by far the best not to mention most surreal. Example: her first fight scene when she slaughters an room full of gangstas all to the Banana Splits theme. The character is the absolute epitome of Girl Power.<br /><br />The movie already has a growing cult following and an sequel is being discussed. I can only hope.
0740748475|4.0|I've loved the comic strips ever since I first came across them a quarter of a century ago - so there's no mystery there. As far as this collection is concerned - the wonderful introduction by Bill Watterson (with a photo of his cat 'Sprite') is worth more than a single read.     However, and this is a BIG however for folks who really love reading Calvin and Hobbes. The mammothine size of the volumes just makes it impossible to read these books as often and as comfortably as one would like to. They are unwieldy and cumbersome and they might just end up standing up on the book-shelf till kingdom come.    My suggestion would be to buy the slimmer series and keep this horribly expensive edition on the 'wish-list' to buy when one is 75 and retired, and with a  pension fund so that one can read the lovely introduction by Bill Watterson...and sit with these editions on a comfy chair next to one's personal library shelf with a pipe and some whisky if one so prefers...

The characters jumped to life as each read his/her letters and my attention was held throughout. It was easy to follow all of the story lines and it helped to have different voices representing all of the characters.  The letter writing concept of this book was intriguing and I know it cannot be replicated.  This was joyful to me... so very joyful.
031606792X|2.0|I've read many reviews that sum up exactly what I think.  We were mesmorized and lured in by so many things- the deep passsionate love and also the danger.  But, book 4 stomps on everything you had come to love and desire.  It will not be what you expect, dream or want, so please consider book 3 the final book and create your own book 4 ending in your own mind.  I'm sure your ending will completely top what Meyers created.  I wish I had stopped at book 3 and just fantasized my own book 4 ending that was perfect for me. If you love books 1&2 especially and want more of it in book 4, then reading book 4 is not for you, as you will be shocked that book 4 lacks everything you had been trained to love previously.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|My wife missed the first year of Fringe. As the 2nd year started she got very interested in it and kept asking me questions about it's origins, Dr Bishop, Peter's past, character and storyline development. Luckily for the both of us I found this DVD on Amazon. Thank you Amazon. We sailed through it. I enjoyed it the second time around also. Enough time had passed for me to have forgotten how the series developed. Recommend it for the collector. It should prove to be an asset in the future, some chilly winter's night with little to do.
045122499X|5.0|In the year 1327 four children come across a man being attacked in the woods near where they live, and from that day on their lives become interwined. This book is the story of their lives over the next four decades. These were very difficult times and that is to put it mildly, with the Hundred Years War, and the Great Plague, both of which get woven into this story. The story is set in the same town, Kingsbridge, as the earlier novel, The Pillars Of The Earth.<br /><br />I found the book a fascinating read! The era is brought vividly and colourfully back to life, by the author. The customs, the clothes, the politics etc. I found myself totally immersed in the medieval times, and did not want the story to end. I would highly recommend this book.
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|I'm viewing the show chronologically, now midway through the second season. The image is impeccable, at least on a 46\\" screen. The menus are very cool looking. You can choose original effects, or the enhanced version. The latter means CG space shots of the Enterprise orbiting around more convincing-looking planets, and we see more varied angles of the ship itself, sometimes really close up. Ship maneuvers are more dramatic, and better convey the intended action. Other enhancements may include upgraded establishment shots of landing parties' surroundings, fixing bad composite shots, and replacing VERY bad-looking or dated mechanics when close up. These changes were not made in a pretentious way. The original space scenes in hi-def look seedy. And the redoes remain respectful to the show's unique visual style. The disks also give options for pop up tidbits like writers' comments, and encyclopedic info on star systems, aliens, and technologies when they are mentioned. There are interviews and retrospects too.     I took away a star because it has audio issues. Currently, I'm reviewing this with the HDTV's original speakers (no amplification or surround sound). Even so, at times sound levels seem wrong: background music is too loud when accompanying dialogue, and overall volume varies. Selecting original mono helps some. Still, on rarer occasions, volume would drop, be out of sync, or mute entirely when following an enhanced scene. (Pause/Play fixed it.) Perhaps all these issues will disappear when the audio system is upgraded.    On Amazon, I though this was an incredible value.
0307454541|5.0|For months, I had been seeing passing references to Stieg Larsson and his trilogy of Swedish detective novels.  While my curiosity had been proded, since I don't read much fiction, I just let things lie.  Finally, last week, the \\"New York Times Magazine\\" (May 23, 2010) did a story on Larsson, his sudden death, the battle between his father and brother with his longtime companion over the immense profits generated by the novels, the possibility of a fourth novel, and that really got my juices flowing.  So while on vacation in West Virginia last week, I picked up a copy and began to read this first volume of the series.  Larsson is not of the John Grisham school, with something dramatic kicking off the story.  Rather, he slowly, and quite skillfully, develops the characters and the background of the story.  It really was not until around page 300 (of the total 600 or so) that things shifted into high gear and we had a runaway \\"page turner.\\"<br /><br />There are many pluses to this fine novel.  In Lisbeth Salander, aka \\"the girl,\\" Larsson has created one of the most interesting characters I have ever come across in a novel, especially in regard to her computer \\"hacking\\" skills.  While less bombastic, the central character, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, is equally interesting and well developed--some think he is based on the author himself.  Having been to Sweden, I found the setting and mannerisms quite familiar, but you don't have to have visited Sweden as a condition precedent to loving this book. The incessant coffee-drinking (almost an addiction in the novel) was quite familiar.  The translation is excellent, though done originally for a British audience it appears, and there are only a few instances of puzzling terms to the American reader.  While there are some extremely violent scenes, this is after all a murder mystery. The only problem I had in enjoying the book was that the Vanger family, who is central to the story, has so many members with Swedish first names it is sometimes difficult to remember who is who.  But not to worry, a handy family tree diagram is placed at the start of the book.<br /><br />The theme that runs throughout the book is how journalists conduct their investigations before writing stories and the sources they rely upon, although ethical boundaries may be insulted in the process. The book well demonstrates how much information about all of us in floating around in cyberspace and situated within our own computers where those in the know can get at it.  So, the novel is informative to a degree as well as just fun to read.  Larsson had a unique gift for effective writing and one wonders why it was only late in his life that these immense gifts came to the forefront.  And of course one mourns for the books he could have written had he lived.  But we can enjoy what we have and these three (or possibly four) books are examples of \\"detective fiction\\" written at the highest levels.sometimes difficult to remember who is who.

B001LRJH0U|3.0|I wasn't in love with the script here as I paused this about half dozen times to get through it. The soundtrack is mixed very low and I had a hard time making out all the laconic dialogue between Ed Harris and Viggo. You've seen this show before, so don't expect much that is new. The sharp-shooter is an old cliche in Westerns, and this one is a bit cliched all the way through, from the buddies, to the loose woman to the various shootouts. An opportunity seemed wasted here to make this better than it is.
0743277708|5.0|I started reading this book already being a fan of the film. However although I think the film is excellent the book is better. The book has more to offer. Like most books which have been adapted to film, you can get more of an idea of the characters and their purpose from the book. Even if you know the story and certainly if you dont it should appeal to people of all ages. The rabbits are endearing and the story is exciting, funny and sometimes sad. The world of rabbits and the folklore created is just wonderful.
630469654X|5.0|This is a old movie but honestly even for a 80s movie this movie is awesome. The music is impressive and the cinematography is quite impressive considering the how old it is. Must own for anyone who likes a classic sci-fi romance.

B002VWONB2|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been mentioned many times previously?  This is obviously a classic in every sense of the word.  The only plot item I find difficult to believe is Ingrid Bergman's character falling for someone else so soon after hearing that her husband has been killed.  Other than this the movie is great.  The Blu-ray transfer is fantastic - it probably looks better on a modern video system than it did in most theaters when first shown in the 1940s.  While I'm not quite old enough to have seen (or appreciated) this movie when it was in original release, it certainly wears its age well.

CD #1: The original first album in mono and stereo...CD #2:  singles, b-sides, rarities (&#34;London Bye Ta-Ta&#34;, &#34;Ching-a-Ling&#34;, &#34;When I'm Five&#34;...and live radio performances of some of the songs) A very extensive booklet and packaging. For many Bowie fans (and myself), this was the David Bowie that I discovered years after I had heard Ziggy  and Aladdin Sane...and it fits right in with the chameleon thing: cool songs, weird songs, strange ones too...Bowie.  Again, I really must stress the sound of this remaster is stunning and the booklet is a great read!

He pulled this one from the shelf and handed it to me. It's always great to find out what teens like. Definitely a fabulous recommendation. Clare creates an incredible underworld of characters based in settings throughout NYC. There are many twists and turns in this fantasy book that will leave you craving more. I highly recommend the entire series. Beautifully written. Now I'm sorry I didn't ask for the young man's name. I'd like to thank him!

B0007RT9LW|3.0|As far as action movies go, \\"Gone In 60 Seconds\\" is a pretty good one for my tastes - a good butter-on-popcorn movie. What I'd like to alert others to is that, while this \\"Director's Cut\\" disc contains a number of good behind-the-scenes-type special features, the version of the actual movie that's on it is VERY different in feel from the theatrical release, which of course was the same version that was on the first release of the movie on VHS as well as on DVD. This new version uses more than a few different scene takes and different camera angles that did the theatrical release. In places, it also seems to be edited differently from the first-released version. A number of the cuts from scene to scene are different. And some scenes were cut and replaced by others. Obviously, any \\"director's cut\\" version of a movie, by definition, is going to be different from the original version. But if the version is THIS different, it's only fair to the customer that he/she be given viewing options. This was done in the latest release of \\"The Bourne Identity\\" on DVD, for example. Both the original and the new version of that movie were put on the disc, so the viewer could choose between the new version with the added or differently edited scenes, or the original version that he/she was familiar with and had enjoyed in theaters.
B000AOEN2C|5.0|I must admit I was a little surprised when I picked up my package at the post office.  I'd been expecting a bulky box holding four individually-packed seasons of \\"Star Trek: Enterprise,\\" such as I'd seen in stores (for a considerably higher price).  Instead this package appeared to contain only a single season.  Curious, I opened it while still at the post office.  Inside was a silver box reminiscent of the \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" release from a few years earlier.  I opened this, and there were all 27 DVDs in gauzy cloth-and-plastic sleeves.  The entire four-season run of the series, all neatly crammed into a box the size of a single season's worth of episodes.  It's very different from the picture shown, but any attempt to reduce packaging & clutter is fine by me!<br /><br />This set appears to be a Chinese-made product intended for a Canadian market.  The text on the package is slightly \\"off\\" in ways that Trekkers will notice, despite the fact that some details are the obvious result of a good deal of research and love for the series.  Naturally, I was a little worried; what if the episodes were dubbed into French, with no English dialogue track?  My Universal Translator hasn't been invented yet!<br /><br />Fear not.  These are the episodes I'd seen and enjoyed on TV, with the same aspect ratio and English subtitles if desired.  There are also foreign-language audio and subtitle tracks available.  As an added bonus, some episodes include optional deleted scenes.<br /><br />My only \\"complaint\\" is a mild one: there is no table of contents, either in the box or printed on the discs.  As I'm watching the episodes, I'm writing one up on a sheet of loose-leaf paper so I can locate particular favorites later with ease.  Frankly, I doubt that this minor inconvenience would be considered a problem to any serious fan of the show.  After all, this is the entire series, formatted properly, in a package that won't require moving to the Captain's quarters to find room for it.<br /><br />Ahead... Warp factor one.factor one.

014241543X|5.0|I rarely hand out five stars and it takes a special book to elicit this type of reaction.  If I Stay is a beautiful story about love and choices, about the true meaning of family and sacrifice.  There is absolutely no doubt that I will re-read this again in my spare time as the story still lingers in my memory, two weeks later.  Forman has created realistic, vibrant characters that are distinct and individual, each possessing the appropriate blend of likability and quirkiness.  Adam and Mia are not your average, dopey romantic YA couple but are sharp, witty, thoughtful, vulnerable and uncertain.  Mia's family is very real, each with their own crazy flaws and mannerisms, I truly appreciate when an author takes the time to develop individual characters as opposed to throwing boilerplate cutouts at their readers.  The bottom line is this: Gayle Forman has accomplished, in less than 60K words, to take her reader on a fully fleshed out journey with characters that live on in one's mind and touch the heart.  I look forward to her next novel.
0385532458|1.0|I've read quite a few Grisham novels and have enjoyed most of them.  Sadly, this one was an exception.  These remind me of the kind of stories that my college professors would say are \\"classics\\" - depressing, pointless and do little (if anything) to give us hope that humans are capable of basic decency.<br /><br />All of the stories take place in Ford County in or near the city of Canton, MS.  I lived in Mississippi for a short period and can tell you that not all the residents of that area are as universally ignorant and/or corrupt as Mr. Grisham paints them to be.<br /><br />This is possibly one of the 10 worst books that I have voluntarily read in my lifetime.
0316069906|4.0|I am nearly done with this book (I have about 30 pages left) and I would say it is generally a very good book.  Whatever your motivation to not eat animals-global impact, environmentalism, health reasons, or humane issues, Jonathan touches on it and gives more than ample reasons why at the very least, meat consumption should be cut way down.  Jonathan gives a good view of the (ugly) truth of factory farming and lets the readers know facts that are often gone to great lengths to have been hidden.  For this fact alone, this book is a must read for anyone who eats meat, ever.    My only criticism is that the book, at times, seems to be disjointed; his thoughts and points do not always seem to follow a logical progression and sometimes it seems as if he has gone off on a tangent without telling the reader so.  HOWEVER, that does not take away from the truths and facts of the book, it just makes it difficult at times to read.  My other criticism is that a handful or less of the stories are overly graphic.  I read one about pig abuses this morning and am still, 12 hours later, feeling sick to my stomach, ready to vomit as the image keeps coming back, uninvited, into my mind.  If you are very sensitive, beware there are a few stories that will turn your stomach.    Overall, as stated before a good read and really a must read if you have ever or will ever consume meat.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I absolutely love this workout.  I find it just as difficult as hour long cardio and conditioning workouts I do at my gym, but this only takes 20 minutes. Get this dvd, you will get a tough workout and see results.  I especially like the difficulty of this workout, some dvds are geared for people getting in shape, but this challenges even the very fit!! Love, love, love this dvd!
0545091020|5.0|Finally, I've been able to \\"read\\" or rather, listen to this book.  I knew very little about it other than a lot of people have read it. I purposely did not read any reviews beforehand because I wanted to judge the book unfettered by expectations and prior plot knowledge.  I read many books, but also like to listen to them while driving and having to do mundane household tasks. Not all books \\"translate\\" well, or are not read by someone who neither takes, or even adds, to the book, an important factor in my opinion.  I've actually stopped listening to a few recorded books because I found the reader's expressive voice to be an annoying distraction to the story.  In such a case, I opt to read the book itself. However, gladly  in the case of The Hunger Games, Carolyn McCormick's voice reads the book as I believe the author intended the story to be heard: straightforward, strong yet feminine, and with unflinching courage; all attributes  that embody Katniss Everdeen; it is from her point of view that we experience The Hunger Games. I also believe this is how Katniss' voice would have emerged within my reading mind, and that in itself is an amazing accomplishment.<br /><br />On to the book itself.  One word: Wow.<br /><br />I've promised no spoilers or reveal too much of the plot because I believe that is how this story should be experience by a reader or listener. I will reveal that Suzanne Collins turns our present and reflects it back on us as our possible future. War. The Conqueror and the Conquered. The disparity of the rich and poor and the vulnerability of the poor to bear the lion's share of society's suffering.  It further addresses (though not directly, always inferred though the story) our insatiable appetite for reality television with its contrived and not-so-real storylines to manufacture drama for a salivating public.  A government's desperate need to keep control of a population by exploiting and killing its children in a way that can only be described as horrifying and peddle it as entertainment for the masses. And, at the center of these converging themes is: Katniss Everdeen.<br /><br />Now, knowing the contents the book, I have read some of the reviews, mostly the one and two star reviews. Most of them compare and accuse this book of being too closely related to Lord of the Flies, or Battle Royale.  Frankly, I think the Lord of the Flies comparison is inappropriate and only relatable because the common threads are children and survival; it's too narrow of a brush to condemn The Hunger Games from my perspective.  This same comparison was made to Michael Grant's Gone series by its critics and that book is more closely related to Lord of my Flies in my opinion.  Yet, I also like Gone (If you like this book you probably will like the Gone series) and accept the comparison without the denouncement.<br /><br />Battle Royale is a closer relation, yet Collin's speaks to America's current obsession with reality TV. At the time of this writing, the Internet and Magazines are abuzz with one woman's apparent nervous breakdown captured on TV to a ratings bonanza.  What if it were required by government that the public was required to watch humans murder the innocent in order to survive themselves? Would many people balk? Or would this be the time our humanity would break through the cracks to bloom at the risk our own lives?  As it stands currently, it doesn't look good for us humans.<br /><br />Bottom line: The story is riveting and Collins will keep you on the edge of your seat.peddle it as entertainment for the masses.

0061914177|5.0|This is a very short but highly inspirational book.  It is well written and very easy to read.  You will breeze right through it.<br /><br />I think there are three major lessons to be learned from this book.  The first you have probably heard many times before, but it is this: follow your passion, do what you love to do, follow your DNA.  Gary repeats this lesson time and again in many different ways.  He makes some very valid points that if you don't do what you are naturally inclined to do, you will not stick with it when the going gets tough.<br /><br />The second lesson is that to get to the top, to be really successful takes work, lots of hard work.  While it is fun to dream about the 4 Hour Workweek, Gary is brutally honest in what it takes to succeed.  There is no doubt that you can and should leverage your time and other resources.  But Gary tells it like it is.  He gives everyone a good dose of reality.  In fact he tells you that if you are not willing to invest a lot of hard work into your success, quit reading his book and settle for a job.  He also gives some very valuable life lessons - \\"but crying about how things should be instead of embracing how things are doesn't do anyone any good.\\"  You get plenty of other gems of wisdom in the book.  I really like his truthful, down to earth philosophy about what it takes to get to the top.<br /><br />The third lesson is a blueprint of how he got to where he is.  He tells you in broad terms the things you will need to do to build your own brand and to stand out from the crowd.  The book gives you specific steps but not detailed instructions.  It is an overall guide, not an instruction manual for how to implement.<br /><br />Reading this book will inspire you to dream big.  It will also let you know that to achieve your big dreams requires hard work.  But he gives you plenty of tips on the things you need to do to make your dreams come true.<br /><br />Reading the book is very interesting and inspiring. The real value is taking the lessons taught in the book and putting them into action.the book and putting them into action.
0307388921|3.0|Not bad, not one of my favorites by Palahniuk but still not bad. His usual jumping around style is a bit more tame this time. But, still has the messages to make you think about the world/ society. Thus, still a good Palahniuk.  It just seemed to drag in parts. Opinions may differ on this, but I was very bored during his chapters he was at work or with heavy interaction with Denny. I didn't enjoy Denny as a character very much.  The endings a shocker (what else could one expect?). Overall, good read, not one of my favorites, but, eh, whatever.
0525423842|1.0|If ever there was a blatant setup for a sequel, this was it.  It is only half a book!  Grisham has sacrificed many of the basic tenets of novel composition by leaving a substantial number of the issues literally hanging.      A cheap and chintzy device if ever there was one.    I'm betting that the entire novel is already written, and that the money-grubbing publisher enjoined a willing editor to direct Grisham to find a separation point that was not too obvious.    Well, it was obvious to me, and I will certainly not be buying the inevitable sequel on principle.    If on the off-chance I am mistaken and this really was the completed story, then shame on Grisham for not doing a thorough job!    Shoddy doings either way.
030726999X|4.0|Book 1 flew after 70 or 80 pages. Book 2 was a jet, flying from page 1. Book 3 is sitting on the tarmac way too long. Eventually it too flies, but some editing of the multiple character intros in the first half of the book would be beneficial. An amazing enjoyable series. Perhaps some talented writer can finish the 200 pages still on the author's computer and make sense of the two other outlined books from his proposed series of ten. Lisbeth is a great character. Start at the beginning and have a memorable time.

0596522347|5.0|PowerPoint is utilized so poorly so often. Slide:ology (in the spirit of Garr Reynolds wonderful books \\"Presentation Zen\\" and his more recent \\"Presentation Zen Design\\") helps provide a much more sophisticated and effective framework for how and when to use PowerPoint to its maximum potential.  Not for the casual PowerPoint user, it suggests the truly symbiotic relationshp between form and content.  It also suggests a critical focus on ideas and genuine persuasion - not just bullet points and information exchange.  It allows you to develop your presentations with a whole new frame of mind and purpose. I enthusiastically recommend Nancy Duarte's approach and sage advice.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I know we are all sick of the whole vampire mania that has struck the world since the Twilight saga began, but trust me this show is not twilight. Instead of refraining from sex and excess, this show is all about it! The series has something for everyone. There is mystery, sex, drama, romance, and comedy. I have not met anyone yet who has not fell in love with this series. My own Dad, who is more into Westerns and nature shows could not get enough of True Blood. The best show on television in my opinion. I have read all of the books, and although the show tends to deviate from the story, which normally annoys me, I have to say no complaints here. Just give this show a chance, you will be glad you did!!

B002VECM6S|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed the movie. It balanced humor and pathos well. Bullock played the dominant southern woman to perfection. I thought Bullock showed both the woman's pushiness and kind heart. I thought Quinton Aaron as Michael did a very good job. He had an intelligence, dignity and a sense of humor that shined through. The little kid was a bit much, but after I watched the family interviewed on TV, I thought it was about right. The football scenes were done well. The only bad acting was done by some of the coaches. I thought Old Miss coach did a really bad job.     The movie took liberties with the story, but the story telling was very good and got the flavor of the story. The movie addressed subtle racism very well. The movie had one scene where the Mrs. Tuohy threatened a drug dealer. It seemed a little unreal, but could it happened? It seemed unlikely, it is hard to say. I haven't heard any comments on it by the family.     It was an amazing story and the movie makers did a good job of bringing to the screen. Did Ms. Bullock deserve an Oscar? Before I saw the movie, I thought no way this role should lend itself to an Oscar nomination. However, after seeing her performance, I changed my mind. It was a very good performance. Whether it was Oscar-worthy performance or not, I don't know. However, Bullock created a very memorable character.
B003FALE3Y|5.0|Being a fan of all previous stargate series, I was looking forward to this when news broke of its release. At first I was a little disappointed, but by the 3rd or 4th episode, I was hooked.

6305313687|4.0|This is generally a very good movie which explores the issue of race relations, primarily revolving around the story of a neo-Nazi group in California.  The acting is good overall, the plot is gripping, many of the images are (appropriately) horrifying, and Ed Norton is impressively buff.<br /><br />The main point the movie illustrates is that, because reality is rich and complex, one can readily sift and bend the evidence in order to construct all sorts of ideologies, including generally racist and specifically neo-Nazi ideologies.  A person with a lot of brainpower, but lacking checks and balances, can do this fairly creatively and rigorously, and such a person possessed with rhetorical skill can sell the ideology to more credulous people, especially if they're at an impressionable age or if they're facing tough times and would like to shift blame away from themselves and toward others.  If you have any doubt about this, try the experiment of spending a few days forcefully arguing for an ideology which you abhor; you might be surprised by the extent to which you begin to convince even yourself!  A related point is that falling in the grip of an ideology fosters a tribal mindset, which can lead to conflict between cultures, nations, classes, religious groups, political parties, \\"special interests,\\" clans, gangs, and of course races (though race is more a cultural than biological concept).  Such conflict can escalate to perpetuated violence (\\"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind\\" - Gandhi).  Again, all of this is illustrated well by the movie.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the movie doesn't really show how the main neo-Nazi character breaks free of his ideology and, moreover, his younger brother breaks free almost literally overnight, which strikes me as fairly implausible.  Because of this flaw, and because the movie didn't really cover any new ground or offer new perspectives for me (I've thought about this stuff for nearly all of my life), I've deducted one star, but I can still recommend this movie to anyone interested in a vivid depiction of these issues.but I can still recommend this movie to anyone interested in a vivid depiction of these issues.

B000EWD1KK|5.0|There are dozens of great Danny Kaye movies, but Secret Life of Walter Mitty to me is the best.  Some Kaye movies get a little overdone with either him doing his nutty acts or with long musical pieces (which are good but sometimes there's just too much of it), but Secret LIfe has neither of these to deter from his great acting or the fun sub-plot of him trying to prove his theory about the bad guys who are trying to kill him.  This movie is fun, fun, fun.  I had an impossible time trying to find a DVD of this movie, and I finally settled on a Korean import purchased through Amazon.  I was hesitant about this version, but to my surprise the DVD is perfect.  I think Korean subtitles appear by default, but they're easily turned off.  I understand one reason this movie is not available on DVD is because a remake is planned for 2012, so obviously a reissue will appear to promote the new movie.  And  just what we don't need: Another terrible remake of a classic film.

Why do artists insist on changing what got them where they are??  The Jack I'm used to is the laid back chilled out person with just an acoustic guitar by the beach.  No drums, No band.  I'm dissappointed big time.  I bought the cd and will keep it but, I hope he rebounds with his next album!

B001HN69AY|1.0|Well, I thought I couldn't go wrong with this movie. I saw Heath Ledger's amazing performance in \\"The Dark Knight\\", and I adore Johnny Depp and jump at the chance to see any movie he's in. But this movie was a complete let-down. The cover looks amazing. It has some big names in it. It looks like an awesome movie for fantasy-lovers. A man who made a deal with the Devil for immortality at the price of giving up his daughter on her 16th birthday. Sounds promising, but that's not the case at all. The plot is sloppy. The movie hardly makes sense. It's just bad. I really don't even know what more to say about it. Perhaps it's such a poor movie because of Ledger's untimely passing. I'm guessing he didn't get to really think it through (and of course he didn't get to complete it, hence Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, and Jude Law stepping in to complete his role). I do believe these usually good actors agreed to complete the movie in honor of their friend, which is lovely. They did not care that the script is terrible. I almost feel that perhaps this is the type of story that MIGHT work in a novel, but just does not translate well at all into film.  That being said, R.I.P. Heath Ledger, and thank you Depp, Farrell, and Law for at least trying to save a sorry film.   I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this film. If you are really curious, wait until it comes on TV or something.

B000059XUO|5.0|What I like about this film is that it does not rely solely on the comic that gave it life. Instead it changes names, makes the story its own. Most people like the movie because it was Brandon Lee's last movie since he died during filming due to an unfortunate accident. Many fans will hark on this fact. The very essence of the film, the message, however, is the important part which makes the movie, at points, even sadder. The point, unfortunately or fortunately, depending on how you look at it; emphasizes Lee's death.<br /><br />The movie itself emphasizes a rock and roll theme which is absent in the comic because sound can only be transferred over though words. It's natural for such a dark comic to breed dark music but there is also a wonderful collection of soft, harmonizing music that helps the tone of the story greatly.<br /><br />For a dark story it is replete with humor, mixed together with violence, poetic prose, and strong messages about life, death and doing what you can in the time that is given to us. This movie, for those who love it, will live in infamy.

B00337KM2S|4.0|\\"Up in The Air\\" is a film that is both a character study and a love story.  This film examines the persona of a man tasked  to perform actions that put him at the center of situations where people respond with anger and pain.  Than same man, a confirmed bachelor set in his ways, encounters a woman who is his match.<br /><br />The primary  theme of \\"Up in the Air\\" is about helping people adjust to the reality that our poor economy may hurt them.  Companies need to downsize or go bankrupt.  But executives in the companies do not like to fire people.  So in comes Ryan Bingham played by George Clooney, who performs two services.  First he fires the people with style and grace, and listens to their rage.  Second he counsels each person, presents him with severance package that includes  transition training and a job placement service.  George Clooney is perfect for this part.  George's personality, his charm, and interpersonal skills, shine as Ryan carefully and tactfully handles each person he counsels.<br /><br />To perform his marvels, Ryan must travel.  He is constantly on the road.  Accordingly he becomes an expert at efficient travel.  At each airport, hotel, and rental agency, he is a known commodity.  He is efficient and loves his job.<br /><br />Ryan has determined that he does not wish what other people crave - family, permanent home and family.  He is the penultimate bachelor who thinks he loves the single life.  He cherishes his freedom and limits his goals to accruing  ten million travel points, and become one of a rare few to attain such a distinction.<br />On one of his trips Ryan meets Alex (played by Vera Farmiga) who also travels most of her life.  Ryan and Alex develop a relationship that becomes a vital subplot of the film.  As Ryan starts to like Alex he begins to question his life style decisions, which leads to more excitement for the story.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Up in the Air\\".  It is an entertaining film with an interesting story and  characterization.ation.

B003E48AYC|1.0|What a disappointment.  I mean... Tim Burton+Alice In Wonderland should = genius, right?  But no.  After he screwed up CHOCOLATE FACTORY I shouldn't have been surprised, but wow.  This was bad.  Awful script with zero character development, it made absolutely no sense (which would be fine if they stuck with the original nonsensical premise, but they TRIED to have it make sense!), and Johnny Depp (who I usually love) was just way too far out this time around.  Short of a great performance by Helena Bonham-Carter, this was nothing but an impressive visual 120 minutes.  That's not enough for me.  Some people can sit and just watch CGI for hours and think it's brilliant.  Personally, I'd like a well-told story and fully-formed characters.  This had neither.  And considering how fertile the material is, I consider that inexcusable.  Again, a major disappointment.

B002ZG9788|1.0|This was bad.  I was fully expecting this to be one of my favorite movies of the year.  They did almost nothing right.  I mean, all they really had to do was take the original 1980 script, excise Bubo and change some of the language then re-shoot the thing with better special effects.  But instead, they changed things around and came out with a bad script, virtually no character development, and the one thing they did brilliantly - updating the special effects and monsters - they shot in such a haphazard and jerky fashion that you never got a chance to really see it.  The first sign that 2010 was going to be a really bad year for movies.
0143038419|2.0|I really expected to like and sympathize with the author and her story but the opposite happened.  Right from the beginning it is clear that this woman is a selfish, weak-minded brat.  I would LOVE for her ex-husband to come out with his own book about what happened in their marriage since Ms. Gilbert does not share any details; probably because it would make her look really bad. I struggled through the middle when she was in India- boring!  It had a few nice moments, hence two stars, but I don't understand why people rave about this book and think she is so inspiring.   The annoyance that is Julia Roberts is the perfect actor to portray this woman and her little tale.

B001HN694K|1.0|Who were they trying to appeal to with this cheesy, um, rendition(?) of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"? My best guess is eight year old tom-boys. Far and away Tim Burton's worst movie. Why does this need to be an action film? It's not like it's even thrilling or magical either. Mia Wasikowska is horrible as Alice; she has but ONE facial expression through the entire film: slightly peeved. Helena Bonham Carter is OK at best with a small role and Anne Hathaway is completely wasted. Johnny Depp is playing insane just because that's all he does now and it's totally dull. In fact, the entire picture is dull The \\"wonderful\\" images are bland and lifeless. Visually it's a poor mans \\"Avatar\\". \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is by far one of the worst movies of 2010; completely misguided, boring, unfunny and worst of all uninspired.<br /><br />Who said we wanted \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" to be a lame combination of the two books, an action film, a feminist piece and have the Mad Hatter AND Alice break dance in the climax?

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|For reasons unknown, the usually talented Michael Patrick King decided to abandon everything, and I mean everything (themes of friendship, culture, sex, difficult life decisions, family, ambition, staying true to yourself- whoever that may be), that made the television series and feature film so groundbreaking, fresh, intelligent and relevant for his unnecessary and painful sequel. The plot (if you can call it that), is that these four woman walk around, complain about nothing and then go on a trip to, literally, the middle of nowhere and then run around like it's a madcap slapstick comedy romp (um.... how is this like the show?). King makes characters that have hated each other (Stanford and Anthony) for six seasons (and the film!) marry. There are useless cameos (Miley Cyrus, Penelope Cruz, Liza Minnelli in a god awful scene) and the most outrageous set design and costumes that physically swallow the actors. It all makes for great misdirection for anyone trying to find anything meaningful (the show and first film were full of fantastic dramatic, comedic and character moments). How is anything of this even remotely linked to the show? It's like I just watched a random movie that happened to contain a bunch of Sex and the City characters. This film is a complete and total insult to a well deserved legacy in pop culture. There is no drama. No emotional hook. No conflict. Nothing remotely compelling... maybe thats why 2 thirds of the film takes place in a desert. Carrie Bradshaw is married for goodness sake, don't we all want to see how she adjusts to that!? I guess not.<br /><br />I guess if you are tryingggggg to find something good, the cinematography is pretty and you get to go on a vacation in the movie theater...<br /><br />and by the way the film runs 145 mins long. This is a GIANT exercise in consuming.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I have been buying Blu-Rays for awhile, and they've looked pretty damn good, but when I put Avatar in...WOW! This movie is awesome on multiple levels. The visuals exceed any movie ever made ever forever! And people knock on the story, but I liked it a lot. I guess it's not popular to care about the world or to like movies with \\"Settler vs. Native American\\" undertones, but I love it. To say this movie wasn't any good is a losing battle since it made more money at the box office than any movie ever made! I believe Avatar will become the cornerstone of every personal Blu-Ray collection. That and the cover sleeve is really cool! Buy this movie!
B00275EHIM|1.0|\\"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\\" is just plain stupid. This is a perfect example of a film that thinks by having lavish production design and loads of CGI, that that makes up a story. Obviously it does not. What little story there is, is extremely contrived and boring beyond belief. Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton, while looking the parts, are flat and annoying. The film is just so choppy with it's editing, it's added effects filters, and muddled dialogue that you pretty much have no idea what is going on. Walt Disney Pictures keeps cranking out terrible, unforgivably bad pictures in 2010 (yes, I'm looking at you \\"Alice in Wonderland\\") that it makes me question the future of this once reliable studio and it's summer tent pole films.
B0031ZWZR2|5.0|This is a great show definitely worth the watch.  It had so much potential, it is a shame the short sighted ABC canecled it after season 1.  But at least that means you can watch a great series without investing years of your life so definitely pick this up.  Ridiculous that they split the dvd sets into two half-seasons to make more money though.
1906694176|5.0|Amazon, got the book to me on Thursday evening, started reading a little at work, but could not put the book down Friday night, Saturday, Sunday afternoon, and finished it Monday afternoon.<br /><br />There are very few books that hook me like this one did.  I've read all three of Stieg Larsson books \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo; Girl Who Playd With Fire; and his last \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\". I enjoyed each one very much, but this was Mr. Larsson's finest.<br /><br />I had read some negative reviews from those in Europe how had got an early reading of this book.  I waited for it's U.S. release and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />If you have not read the other books first I would highly recommend you do so before you attempt \\"the Hornet's Nest\\" one really builds on the others.  If you have read book two \\"Played with Fire\\" you will probably get right into \\"Hornet's Nest\\".  The author does a great job of catching the reader up on what happened in book two, without dragging it out to much.<br /><br />The characters are well developed in all three of these books.  They are complex, but understandable.  The story moves quickley and will make the reader keep turning pages wanting to find out what will happen next.  There are many twist and turns that the author weaves the read through, but they all come together and makes for a complete package.<br /><br />There is a number of new characters that you will need to get to know, but they all do a great job putting the storie line together.  Yes, Lisbeth is in the hospital for most of this book, but Mikeal's character comes to life, and it really works.<br /><br />I thought the last 30-40 pages were a waiste, but that's ok.  I had trouble with the Swedish names they all look the same to me, and I also had problems with the money system seeing as how I understand dollars and money was refered to in Swedish currency.<br /><br />If you have read Mr. Larsoon's first two books you won't want to miss his last.  He will be missed by the reader.  I give the book a 5 out of 5 rating.ut of 5 rating.

B000HEWEEE|3.0|Other reviewers have done justice to the plot - a thin device but sufficient for the purposes of the movie, and it doesn't bear close inspection so it's best to move on to the dramatic performances of the two protagonists.  Suffice it to say that the script helps keep things tight, yet there's enough space and light to permit us to engage with these two otherwise fairly stereotypical characters. Lots of nice visual counterpoints and use of color to echo the plot developments, and all kudos to the cameraman (or people) and to the director, who makes this a very sumpuous feast. The love story is of course pure Hollywood schmalz so don't look for profundity, but if you want a nice date movie then this certainly fills the bill. My only complaint is that in the end the need for box-office approval mandated the Great American Happy Ending, which was somewhat out of keeping with the rest of the movie. If they'd been brave, they'd have allowed the plot to keep the two lovers separate in the end - but who cares about brave when you need to sell tickets reliably?  Americans absolutely hate downbeat endings so of course in the best tradition of Uncle Walt this has the happy-ever-after that middle America needs.  As a movie this works better than The Timetraveler's Wife so if you only want to buy one time-slip DVD this year, I'd recommend Lake House.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Excellent image quality, and the audio is also in spanish, i read another reviews saying to avoid this edition, i only have to say that they are crazy, i bought this blu ray disc and i am happy with it, i didn´t care the another reviews, great blu ray, great movie.
1416583408|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, it is well written.  But the test of this kind of book is if you can apply what you learn.  I wasn't even done reading the book when I was able to apply its lessons to our small dog.  I can now convey what I want to Gigi much more quickly than before.  It makes our relationship just a tad better.
1441407820|5.0|Using a simple style (remember, words themselves are the obstacle to experiencing reality) Hesse weaves Upanishadic philosophy into Siddhartha's quest for the meaning of life and I must say, brilliantly succeeds in doing that. Here and there in the book you come across sentences that clearly show his understanding as well as his keen observations during his trip east. Like Govinda who see various images as he kissed Siddhartha's forehead you might potentially see some of your life experiences swirl around as you read it. Next stop - Narcissus and Goldmund.
1592332803|2.0|I bought this book some time ago and found that I haven't had much use for it.  Nearly every recipe relies on Ener-G brand egg replacer.  You would do just as well to buy a non-vegan cookbook and make your own substitutions.  You can taste the egg replacer in some of the recipes, too, which is pretty unpleasant.  I would recommend such resources as Vegan Cupcakes Take Over The World and Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar over this book.  The Joy of Vegan Baking is fairly unimaginative, and your money could be better spent elsewhere.
B002M2T1UO|4.0|As has been mentioned often, this box set, while it looks spectacular, is not exactly disc-friendly. So to avoid any scratches, I picked up some DVD cases to house the discs.....better safe than sorry. The extra $5 I spent was well worth it, and as of this writing the total price would still fall below $100. Which is one helluva price for every episode of one of TV's finest crime dramas ever.     besides the price, another incentive for purchasing this is that the earlier seasons are now in widescreen format. now that more & more people are picking up widescreen TVs, i'd consider this a nice upgrade since the original airings.    in addition to the issue with the disc sleeves, another negative is the absence of subtitles for season 7. it's head-scratching, especially since seasons 1-6 have that option.       5 star show, but one star docked for the sketchy disc sleeves (although a few bucks oughta rectify the situation) & the subtitles issue with season 7....
1439153663|4.0|I enjoyed the depth of the story and the usual circumstances of the book's heroine as an Irish immigrant slave.
B0033AX26I|2.0|Most of the album, while cleanly mixed and vigorously performed, is in Spanish, so unless you can understand Spanish, you're not going to understand most of what's going on.  And don't think that the the booklet that comes with the CD is going to help you:  if features a historical introduction in Spanish and English but not the lyrics -- in either language.  Thus unless you know Spanish and a good deal of history already, you've basically got an album of Mexican and Irish music on your hands.<br /><br />For my part I was very eager to get a hold of this, as it seemed like a killer idea for a concept album:  a series of songs, in Mexican and folksy style, exploring the story of Saint Patrick's Battalion, a group of U.S. immigrants, mostly from Mexico, who rebelled against the U.S. and fought on the side of Mexico against the U.S. during the Mexican-American War (1846-1848).  Wow.  In addition, I am a huge fan of Ry Cooder's mandolin work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was less than blown away.  Doing the songs using Mexican and Irish styles was great, but singing everything in Spanish simply froze me out.  It's pretty much indistinguishable from just another CD of Mexican music.<br /><br />Note that there is a version out there of \\"Sailing to Mexico\\" with Ry Cooder doing a much more elaborate job on the mandolin opening.  It far outstrips the version on this album but THAT'S NOT THE ONE ON THIS ALBUM!  (To tell you the truth, it's not clear that Ry Cooder is even playing the mandolin on the track that was included here:  there is no mandolinist credited in the liner notes.)<br /><br />Another thing that irritated me about this CD was that it seemed to be a CELEBRATION of American soldiers who fought against the U.S.  The San Patricios, remember, came to an inglorious end in Battle of Churubusco, during which they were eviscerated.  You wouldn't get any of that from the final few songs on this CD, which feature triumphant, joyous melodies.  In fact, I would characterize the whole approach of the musicians to this material as not exploratory, but reverential.  Was this the Chieftains' (an Irish band) roundabout way of saying they hated the U.S.?  The album, after all, was conceived and developed during the Bush years.cians to this material as not exploratory, but reverential.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|Loved the movie, it is filled with adventure, a love story and different from any other movie I've seen.  As good as Star Wars the first movie.  The Special Effects are outstanding.
B001FB5634|1.0|Was really looking forward to this, as I enjoy post-Apocalyptic movies, but I ended up hating it.<br /><br />The problem boils down to this:  they haven't got a story.  They haven't got any insights.  All they've got is suspense.<br /><br />Now, the movie is well-directed and the editing is even more impressive.  But essentially they're cheating.  One example of this is how, when you're on the edge of your seat because you think somebody's going to come up on them, there'll be a clanking, metal sound.  But in fact there is nobody else there:  the clanking sound, we are to learn in a moment, is merely the pre-audio of a flashback scene whose visuals are to follow a split-second later (e.g., a bullet clanking on the table).<br /><br />The movie's formula got old very fast:  There's a kid in danger!  Oh no!  Are they going to get him?  Praise God, not that time!  Whew!  But -- O Lordie! -- the cannibals would choose just this moment to come back!  Drat the luck!<br /><br />After the movie did this too many times, I realized why the filmmakers were doing it:  they had nothing else to offer you.  Unwilling to get into what the catastrophe was, we are left with their BIG INSIGHTS:  survival will be difficult if there is a global cataclysm and traditional values (such as not eating one's fellow man) will in many cases be jettisoned.<br /><br />Er, didn't need to spend two hours with their movie to learn that.  As one critic wrote, \\"A situation and a series of incidents don't equal a story, though, which is why the book was so glaringly flawed. Who wants a date with agony?\\"<br /><br />If you enjoy post-Apocalyptic scenarios but want a little more substance, try:  \\"A Canticle for Leibowitz,\\" \\"On the Beach,\\" \\"A Boy and His Dog,\\" \\"The Stand,\\" \\"No Blade of Grass,\\" \\"Earth Abides,\\" etc., some of which are movies too.  Heck, even Costner's \\"The Postman,\\" though sappy, was a lot more watchable than this.
B0013527I4|5.0|Had no problems with the product.  The package actually came practacally next day, even though only paid for regular shipping.  Very satisfied.
B0039UTDA6|2.0|The two stars are for the incredibly beautiful and mesmerizing cinematography, but don't buy this verion.  The narration by Oprah is atrocious and extremely irritating. In all fairness to her she probably had little to do with the script and she was certainly directed as to how to read it. A few have suggested that the negative criticism of her narration is some kind of Oprah bashing. If you have seen this version you know that is simply not the case. No one can argue that Oprah is not a great TV personality and one of our finest movie actresses. And she does have a very pleasant voice. However, she simply stinks as a narrator of this production. Wait and get the Blu Ray David Attenborough version and then you won't be sorry.
B001UJUGZY|4.0|First and foremost, the cover of the dvd does not tally at all with this film's theme. This is not a horror tale like \\"The Grudge\\" but rather, a psychological thriller with a romantic twist. It is nice to see Lee Pace in a different light, away from the \\"Pushing Daisies\\" persona. Sarah Michelle Gellar also did a tremendous job in this little known flick.<br /> The plot is good and it is rare to find a film which deals with this kind of story. Buy!
1584282584|4.0|First of all, make sure you have a TTL flash setup before you buy this book - wouldn't be nearly as useful otherwise.     Now, if you do have a TTL flash, this book is great to learn how to use it while on-camera in a way that make the photos look natural and not-ugly. The best thing about having it on-camera is that you don't have to spend a bunch of money on light stands/radio triggers etc. The techniques described in this book are also not too heavy on flash modifiers...which is great since you don't have to go buy a ton of accessories before you can start using your flash. Some tips are obvious, but a very useful read on-the-whole.
B000YENUI6|4.0|Eastern Promises is a very good film, I think cronenberg finally did a good job with a film for once,with the exception of the male nudity fight scene I enjoyed the movie and it's portrayal of Organized Crime.It has great acting and moments.It's worth watching.
0307454541|1.0|This is my first Amazon review, and the first time in years that I have not dragged myself to the end of a book... even when it's disappointing.<br /><br />The author's unexpected death must have resulted in a complete absence of editing.  This story should have been whacked down to size with a machete by a skilled editor.  The murder mystery was \\"solved\\", but yet the book continued to plod on with the dreary financial wrap-around story line.  So many cliches with the heroine's \\"eyes flashing with anger\\" and gratuitous violence against women.  So much repetition, rehashing, and coffee drinking.  Whenever the author wrote himself into a corner, some miraculous computer hacking would result in the exact information that was needed.<br /><br />I usually would not say this either:  Go see the movie instead!  It removed the excess baggage from the story, kicked up the pace, and gave the audience a taste of Scandanavian atmosphere.  Plus you'll only invest 2-1/2 hours of your life in Larsson's world.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|I like many aspects of this refreshingly earthy gritty variant of the various Robin Hood sagas. The motion and emotion are entrancing -- with some good humor to balance the many grim era-settings -- such as the Norman French \\"landing-craft\\" coming FROM Normandy for the last battle -- much like the ones that went TO there more recently [WW II]. The settings are very historically realistic Norman Medieval [including Celtic and Saxon aspects]. Being a longtime fan of the Middle Ages -- I am very pleasantly surprised at the many spot-on correct details. For example -- the realistic swords -- and swordplay with \\"foul\\" close-combat moves such as pommel-slams, head-butts, heel-trips and grappling -- much as in the Fectbuchs [\\"fight-books\\"] originating from Medieval experience. Then there's the pick-axes and bill-hooks used by calvary to remove footmen and vice versa. The staves, spears and lances drive home their points accurately. The longbows depicted are not fancy-fantasy ones -- but in their stark yew-wood reality. \\"Robin Longstride\\" [Russel Crowe] spent months learning about Robin Hood and his Norman Medieval setting -- and gained true skill with the longbow by-the-way. The siege equipment on both sides is quite real -- such as missle-weapons, shield-walls, hook-ladders, drop-stones, boil-pots and fire-bags. The other artifacts and usages such as tools, plows, and winches are spot-on. The castles and other dwellings are great in their lush greenwood settings. The production goes well into historical food, drink, manners and customs in those settings -- like the ring-dancing of Robin and Marion. The churches, castles, chapels, manors, houses and lands are incredibly historical -- as well as are the customs of the folks who live in these settings -- such as \\"Lady Marion\\" [Cate Blanchett] -- who gives a splendidly spirited presentation of the [eventual] partner of \\"Robin Longstride\\" -- these two leading a great number of excellent actors and acts to initiate the viewer into a graphic medieval expanded saga of Robin Longstride Hood. Great that this movie is on DVD +++nto a graphic medieval expanded saga of Robin Longstride Hood. Great that this movie is on DVD +++

B003BKF696|5.0|Wow!  What a great cd.  I don't tend to buy many cd's, but in the past few weeks my random selections of music have really been fruitful.  Going through new releases of new music I found The National, and boy am I glad I found them!  This cd i great!  At first I was weary thinking it would be one of those artsy indie type albums that had bizarre sounds and loud ceaseless ramblings.  Luckily for me this album is nothing like that!  While indie in nature, The National have a sound that is all their own.  ure they can be compared to other bands, but this band is something special.  The greatest standout is of course the voice of the lead singer Matt Berninger.  He sings in this magnificently dark baritone that adds richness and depth to each song he sings.  Many times I thought of Johnny Cash, but in a heavier more melodic rock sound.  The best words to describe these songs are somber beauty.  The way these songs are put together and sung is at once dark, but redemptive.  Driving in a car or listening to it on your Ipod gives you a feeling of haunted bliss.  I never heard of this band before I bought their album, but I think it's time to look at the rest of their catalogue.  Highly Recommended!!
B003JYOEYM|4.0|Fresh off a fifty-mile drive from the closest theatre playing horror legend George A. Romero's new zombie flick 'Survival of the Dead,' I am more than pleased to say the time & oh-so-expensive gas was worth it. Though Lord Romero has received more than his fair share of negative feedback for his last few films ('Bruiser,' 'Land of the Dead,' and 'Diary of the Dead), I have yet to see a single film of his that I would call less than good. And, my friends, the streak continues with 'Survival of the Dead.' Sure, I may not be the most unbiased of critics on the matter, but we're all hooked to something.<br /><br />'Survival of the Dead' focuses on two sets of very different characters. The first we're introduced to is led by 'Nicotine' Crocket (Alan Van Sprang), the jerk \\"guardsmen\\" that first appeared in 'Diary of the Dead.' He wasn't a central figure in the previous film, but just one of the many dangerous obstacles the main characters from 'Diary' stumbled across during their journey. Crocket leads a group of other guardsmen around the country looking for, well, anything they can find. After hooking up with a crackshot kid and an armoured car full of cash, the guard unit heads up north after their discovery of Patrick O'Flynn (Kenneth Welsh), an old Irish fella on the internet advertising a safe haven. O'Flynn, the leader of his own group, is a now-banished former resident of Plum Island, a small isle in the Atlantic. Intent on seeking vengeance against the other zombie-saving Irish clansman from the island, O'Flynn convinces Crocket's gang to head to Plum Island with him.<br /><br />The first thing that many Romero fans will notice is something that had been missing in the 'Dead' series before this film: a recurring character. Crocket, the antihero and occasional narrator of the new film, wasn't the worst choice Romero could make for a recurring character in 'Survival of the Dead.' Alongside Crocket, there is a varied mix of supporting characters from the horny lesbian Tomboy (Athena Karkanis) to the equally horny token minority Francisco (Stefano DiMatteo). One of the major problems most people (including myself) had with Romero's last film was the acting. In this film, the acting was pretty much satisfactory, with only couple issues (DiMatteo being a major issue in himself). Among the other technical aspects, the Romero-controlled factors of the film were, as expected, damn good. The direction and writing were much better than that of 'Diary,' and the beauty of the Ontario-filmed landscapes were wonderfully captured.<br /><br />Unfortunately, one visual aspect that was not very good with the film was. . . what else. . . the CGI. I, unlike many horror fans, am not completely against the use of CGI. It has its uses and can actually help a film if used properly. Sure, it's almost always better with real gore effects, but the use of CGI (as Romero himself said) can greatly help a low-budget production. CGI means less time actually on set (which is the most expensive part of the filmmaking process) and it means that Romero can do kills that he had only dreamed of before. Speaking of one very memorable kill from 'Survival,' he said he had been wanting to do it for a long time, but not even the great Tom Savini could pull it off. This means CGI basically allows limitless execution of whatever the director envisions. Sadly, though, the effect is lost much of the time when CGI is used, especially when it's not very well done.<br /><br />Overall, 'Survival of the Dead' is not going to please everyone, quite possibly because people are often too focused on what they think modern cinema should be, and what Romero should be offering. However, the film is a fun zombie-filled ride with a solid story and some memorable gore scenes. It does lack quite a bit in the tension & suspense of the previous films and focuses a bit too much on the comedic side, but it is still a fine addition to the zombie subgenre.<br /><br />Final Verdict: 7.5/10<br/><br />-AP3-/><br />-AP3-

1593080778|5.0|Most people are at least familiar with the theory of natural selection, but that is not to say that they are familiar with what Darwin actually said in Origin and how he said it. Thus I agree with the reviewers who say this is essential reading.<br /><br />Although Darwin says it is \\"one long argument\\", it is in fact two: that the diversity of life shares a common ancestry, and second that this divergence came about primarily as a result of natural selection.<br /><br />There are a number of re-editions of Origin out there, especially given the recent 150th anniversary of its publication, so why choose this one?<br /><br />Above all it is an ideal student edition (and I include here anyone who reads critically): it is cheap, has been type-set with sufficient margins for notes, and is as lightweight a paperback as you will find for a 400 page book. The type is large and accessible, and the introduction by George Levine is, at 20 pages, short enough to hold one's interest while with enough content to warrant its inclusion. Also, given all the recent re-editions available there are few that provide the 1859 text of the first edition. This one does.<br /><br />This is important if you want to know how Darwin originally presented his ideas. Later editions (there were six in total, the last published in 1876) included clarifications and answers to specific later objections. As a result the first edition reads better and is a more straightforward argument. If you are a Darwin scholar you will probably want to engage with these later editions - the sixth is widely available, for the others you can find them in specialist libraries (the University of Oklahoma has the lot!), or now also in beautifully scanned editions through the Darwin online website.<br /><br />This is not the place to go into the detail of what gets added to the later editions, but if this book gets you hooked you might want to take your Darwin studies further. Perhaps the most notable and certainly the most famous addition is the insertion from the second edition onwards of the words \\"by the Creator\\" into the poetic last paragraph of the book (There is grandeur in this view of life... ) This is interesting stuff: was Darwin seeking to clarify that he saw evolution as God's mechanism for creating the awesome diversity of life that we see around us? Or, was this a judicious attempt to allay theological concerns that distracted his readers from the science? The jury is still out on this. Darwin certainly wrote to his friend and confidante Joseph Hooker that he later regretted \\"truckling to public opinion\\", but he did not remove the insertion from later editions. In his autobiography, written towards the end of his life, he confided that while he had gradually lost his faith in a personal God, he recognized that others had found natural selection quite compatible with religious belief, most notably the Anglican theologian Charles Kingsley and the American botanist and Presbyterian, Asa Gray.<br /><br />There is so much in this book that it will keep you coming back. You might also want to take this further: Although Darwin only hinted at human evolution in Origin, saying only in the last pages that 'Light will be thrown on the origin of Man and his history.\\" He addressed that hot potato explicitly in Descent of Man (1871).from the second edition onwards of the words \\"by the Creator\\" into the poetic last paragraph of the book (There is grandeur in this view of life... ) This is interesting stuff: was Darwin seeking to clarify that he saw evolution as God's mechanism for creating the awesome diversity of life that we see around us?

B00002R0MC|5.0|Anyone who has listen to Bob Marley knows his works will forever live on. I do prefer disc 2,3,4 the best, but the entire CD set is worth the price.
B0021L8V1G|3.0|This review is based on the perspective of an older viewer who was asked by a younger relative to accompany him to see this film.  If you fit into this category, you will be able to survive the 90-minutes or so without any real difficulty.  In fact, despite all of the pyrotechnics and noisy special effects, the storlyine has elements of humor and human interest.  The \\"Justin Hammer\\" and Gary Shandling characters, in particular, were hilarious and will keep you laughing.
B002MRRRAA|5.0|I have not yet got this DVD,but I will.I have heard this was one helluva concert. I love Nirvana.I was 12 in 1967 and bought \\"Strawberry Fields\\" 45 as my first record bought with my parental allowance, paper-route,lawn-mowing earnings.The Beatles have always been my favorite band.The Stones and Who and et al are a distant second,third or whatever( of bands from the '60's). Kurt Cobain's melodies rival the Beatles' in their tunefulness.Nirvana should be in the R'R Hall,(even if Kurt would probably hate it-yet again,he might not,hell he couldn't make up his mind what he wanted).The Pistols,Clash,G.Dead and P.Floyd are other top bands in my book.However,the Fabs far outdistance them all. Actually,Nirvana,had they lasted longer and developed in different directions could've stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Beatles-that's how great Kurt's melodies were. God knows what more Kurt would've pulled out of his hat had he not pulled the trigger.God rest his soul.  I was recently re-viewing the April '75 \\"Tomorrow Show w/ Tom Snyder\\" w/ John Lennon, and I'll be damned if ol' Tom uttered a God-given Prophesy:(to Lennon:)  to paraphrase: \\"Who knows,maybe some other band will come along in 1988 and re-start the rock'n'roll thing all over again,just like the Beatles did to Elvis\\".  Well,Nirvana was that band and Tom Snyder is a Prophet.

B003BZXHX8|5.0|Barbra sings well known and loved songs in this intimate setting.  Even watching the DVD, it feels as if she is in your livingroom.  The photography helps create the intimacy, but Barbra's being offers the intimacy and the audience accepts it.  Hearing she was wearing her bedroom slippers brings you even closer to the woman.  The shots taken from behind her show a husband and lover who can't take his eyes off her, as is the case with the audience.  The quality of the sound is professional and considering it was shot in such a small setting, it plays crisply, clearly, and satisfying.<br /><br />I've never felt this close to Barbra as I do watching the DVD.  It is more than second helpings to have the DVD and not be there.  This DVD comes very close to being there.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|This was a pretty well done \\"documentary\\" about food in our society.<br />I see most reviewers here focus on the film's harsh view of corporations and the food industry .............. BUT ............ I think a more important message in this film is for people to STOP BUYING AND EATING CRAP !!!<br /><br />There are plenty of good sources of food out there; especially if you do more cooking at home and don't even think about ever stepping foot inside 99.9999% of franchised restaurants again or buying TV dinners.<br /><br />In general, the food factories certainly deserve some blame ; but so do many individuals who make bad choices for themselves.

I bought the book for prompt ideas for my class.  It has been amazing.  So much so that I'm facilitating a class for teachers wanting to learn more about building their students' writing skills and our LA department is going to buy a copy of the book to give to each of the workshop participants.  Yay!  I can't wait to show more teachers how this book can be used to begin some fantastic activities in the classroom.

0316113506|5.0|John Ratey is a Harvard psychiatrist who subspecializes in the clinical use of exercise in mental diseases.  In Spark he examines clinical and lab research in neuro-hormones, the chemical soup that determines how well our brain works.   The front plate quote by Plato says it all,\\" In order for man to succeed in life, God provided him with two means, education and physical activity.  Not separately, one for the soul and the other for the body, but for the two together.  With these two means, man can attain perfection.\\" (To this I'd like to add good nutrition, sorry Plato.)   This book has many interesting stories together with the technical information.  It is a quick, enjoyable read.   We feel good when we exercise because it allows the brain to function at its best.  Muscle building, cardiovascular conditioning, reducing stress and tension are secondary.  Our society and its conveniences have made it difficult to get enough physical activity.  We now have to work at it.   The Naperville School District (19,000 students) west of Chicago has redesigned its P.E. system.  All students participate in P.E. classes which develop cardiovascular fitness. In class students use heart rate monitors to gauge their degree of exertion.  The only games played are ones with high levels of sweat like three-on-three basketball.  Students are taught to encourage and support each other.  The results have been dramatic: 10% of the number of overweight children found in other school districts; only 3% of students in Naperville are overweight.  In an international study of 230,000 students those from Naperville were sixth in math (first in the U.S.A.) and first in science, ahead of Singapore, China, Korea and Japan.  To confirm that the fitness program is key a study compared test results after P.E. class with results several hours later.  Scores were much higher right after the fitness class, findings which confirmed prior animal studies.  Vigorous exercise makes your brain work much better especially right after the exercise but also longer term.   Naperville is an upper middle class community where many parents are scientists or engineers.  Titusville, Pennsylvania is not.  It is a failed factory town north of Pittsburgh where they copied the Naperville P.E. program beginning in 2000.  Test scores went from below state average to 18 percent above.  Since 2000 there has not been one fist fight in the junior high school.  They were common before.   A share of the 2000 Nobel Prize was given to a Eric Kandel who demonstrated that practice (piano, vocabulary etc.) caused neurons to grow new branches and made branches get larger and better connected to adjacent neurons.  A neuro-chemical, BDNF, has the same effect plus it causes new neurons to form from stem cells and protects neurons from decay and death.  Exercise elevates BDNF levels throughout the brain.  Other beneficial body and neuro-hormones also increase during exercise.  In summary, exercise increases alertness and motivation; it encourages new connections between neurons; it causes new neurons to form.  Adding a complexity to exercise with things such as yoga, Pilates, tennis, or martial arts is even more effective than simple exercise.   Exercise has been studied in patients with depression, stress, anxiety, attention deficit, addiction, menstrual and menopause problems.  In general exercise has outperformed standard drug therapy in each of these conditions.  That's not even taking into consideration the considerable side effects and cost of medications.   It's been well documented that Alzheimer's disease incidence is much lower in regular exercisers (50% less).  Animal studies have shown exercise effects in models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's where findings in the brain were significantly reversed.  Mental exercise is equally important.  An epidemiologic study in Minnesota has followed an order of nuns who stay very active.  When one died at age 85 of a heart attack she was found to have severe Alzheimer's disease at postmortem exam.  But she had tested in the 90% percentile on cognitive tests shortly before her death.  Severe pathologic Alzheimer's due to her genetic makeup had no effect on her life.  Billions of dollars are being spent on genetic and pharmaceutical cures for this devastating disease, but we already know that a combination of diet, exercise and vigorous mental activity will prevent it.    Ratey's exercise prescription:    Aerobic - Four times a week; 30-60 minutes at 60-70% of maximum heart rate (220 - age = theoretical maximum heart rate)    Strength - Twice a week with weights or resistance equipment.    Balance and Flexibility - Twice a week for thirty minutes.  Yoga, Pilates, Martial arts, dance are possibilities.    In general more is better, harder is better, with another is better.    N.B. Interval Training (e.g. 30 second bursts of maximal effort several times during the aerobic sessions causes increase in human growth hormone, a valuable healing and anti-aging substance that normally is at low levels later in life. The author lost his `spare tire' a few weeks after adding this to his exercise regime. Nothing else had worked.)
1439102813|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who has dementia or someone who cares for someone with some form of dementia.  This book deals from the perspective of the person with dementia not the caretaker.  Many books on dementia are from the caretaker perspective but this is actually from the patient's perspective.  i wil recommend this to my students who learn about dementia in a nursing gerontology course.
B0021L8V1G|4.0|The best asset of a superhero franchise is when any installment lacks hubris:  either from its hero or from those who design it.  When a superhero is thrust in such peril that the outcome is in question, and the usual assumption that the good guy always wins has to be drawn back to consciousness, you know the creators have assembled a great movie.    All the parts are intact:  The trajectory is fun; the enemy is menacing; the dialog is witty and clever; and the story is cogent and clear--easy enough to understand, but detailed enough to be stimulating without overloading our efforts to suspend disbelief.    This time Iron Man [aka Tony Stark] (Downey Jr.) faces off with a Congressional committeeman, headed by Senator Stern (Chandling) who challenges his personal armored technology as dangerous and capable of escalating the arms race when brought to the wrong hands.  Stark's snappy answers win the day, but his lack of concessions bring a headlong, prideful fall that sends him unraveling.    The Senator's witness, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell)[another arms' dealer] doesn't take his defeat in stride.   While showing off his prowess at auto race in Monaco, Stark faces his biggest challenge when an equally disgruntled Russian nemesis, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) unveils his electrifying half-man, half-human hybrid imitation.  From there Hammer builds an alliance with Vanko that makes inroads into the U.S. military, including with Stark's closest ally, Lt. Col James Rhodey (Cheadle).    Of course the trajectory of the movie doesn't work without the fun.  A celebrated Iron Man must be chastened by all his handlers, including Pwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, his still wise-cracking assistant.  New to the fray is Scarlett Johansson in a refreshing, make-over role as the attractive and lethal duo identity Natalie/Natasha.  And while Stark's adolescent tendencies are not towed in line by both leading femme fatales, Cheadle and Jackson give able support.    This adventure does goto the edge of danger, but not enough to fully pay dirt.  In some ways this isn't a five-star film for what I first thought were intangibles.  My first inclination was to dock the movie for its overlong half-time exposition, but that's not really fair.  An adventure movie that takes time out to think shouldn't be diminished, particularly when it delivers on the intelligence.  It also helps that Iron Man has some health/toxicity issues, thickening the plot, even if it is a dropped opportunity to provide more tension.      The freshness and fun are just as apparent; it just comes down to the one factor I started out with at the beginning:  Do you have to stop and wonder (while you're clinging to someone's hand [or your chair] and sitting at the edge of your seat) how this guy is going to get out of all the mess?  What this sequel has going for it will propel it to at least two more sequels, but to have the cliffhanger feel of a sequel, like, say, 'Spider Man 2' is a bit of a stretch.

0545123275|3.0|I just knew I was going to love this book.  I love werewolves, and I have been on a YA kick here lately.  I was dissappointed.  It wasn't that I disliked this book, but I certainly did not love it.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS:<br />Grace was attacked by werewolves when she was a young girl.  While being attacked, she focused in on this one wolf with amber eyes.  She did not scream or struggle, just looked in his eyes.  Right off the bat, I had a problem with this story.  I know this is fiction and not suppose to be real, but shouldn't it be at least a little believable.  Moving on, she survives the attack and becomes obsessed with the wolves.  She isn't afraid of them.  She wastches them constantly and misses them during the summer months, especially her wolf with the unique eyes.  Her junior year, a boy is killed by a wolf and the town goes crazy.  They start hunting them, and Grace tries to stop them.  Then her wolf shows up on her back porch shot and then turns into a teenage boy, Sam.  The rest of the story is about how much they love and adore each other and how he does not want to turn into a wolf again.  He knows that if he does, he will not get another summer to turn human.<br /><br />I felt that the plot was slow through the middle and even towards the end.  Grace's friends are such a key part to her life we are told but then once Sam shows up, they are hardly ever around or mentioned.  Not a lot actually happens once he shows up except for Grace trying to keep him warm so he won't turn and learning his background.  Also, I know there are dead beat parents out there, but I don't think Grace's came off as too believable.  I think this must be one of those cases where the author is trying to really set up the world for her next novel.  I am kind of intersted in reading the next book, but I don't care to reread this one which I consider the ultimate test of a good book.  I just wish that there was more going on in the plot, and I honestly am not that crazy about the whole only turning into wolves when it's cold idea.y turning into wolves when it's cold idea.
B002ZG98ZA|5.0|I had the best time watching this movie, few have made me laugh so hard. People seem to want Casablanca, but forget that movies can be just an escape.  For two hours I was in a world that doesn't exists and is a little fake. Sex and the City is a fairytale for women and gay men.
B0036B8MXC|4.0|Hey, I'm a girl and I absolutely  adore movies/videoes, etc. based on true actual events. I love blood and guts and gore and Spartacus did not disappoint. I believe that all the actors did an outstanding job portraying the characters they were given to play. Andy Whitfield was an unknown gem to me but I will now seek out other movies that include him (I pray for his complete recovery#. Lucy Lawless and John Hannah I have enjoyed in the past. Manu Bennett is a delight to the eye and Nick Tarabay is as slippery a con artist as I have ever seen. The only thing I didn't like was the complete over-saturation of foul language. I don't understand why today's directors/producers/writers, etc. think that profanity provides a more enjoyable viewing experience. I know that people did #and do)use colorful language but I find it hard to believe that it was used to the degree that it was in Spartacus. I enjoy well written dialogue with a broad vocabulary. I think that writers that limit themselves to smut language show a lack of education. I think they use the cheaper, easier route that profanity provides. Instead of providing a powerful \\"punch\\" I find that over usage of profanity actually weakens any point that is trying to be made. We are becoming inured to it and, thus, don't hear what is really needing to be said. Anyway, I enjoyed the first season and I look forward to watching the second one.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I think this series built up nicely.  I liked the final book the best! Very exciting and well thought out.  I am going to miss the characters.  The concluding book is a bit too detailed in certain sections but overall I think this is a great read!
B00005JKQ6|5.0|The Swimmer is an unusual, unique movie that you will probably never forget.  Hall of famer Burt Lancaster reaffirms his legendary acting prowess in this actionless and philosophical &#34;trek&#34;  about a &#34;successful&#34;  middle-aged man who spends a sun-drenched day in his life returning home in the burbs by traversing his neighbors' properties and swimming through their pools . He is ruggedly handsome, fit, glib and popular. He begins his journey poolsiding with rich friends who just say what he wants to hear and ends with some less rich &#34;friends&#34; who recall a less flattering past and tell him what he doesn't want to hear and what he probably doesn't know. Initially, the swimmer is admired and adulated but ultimately  is admonished and abhorred. This film has a lot to do with an individual's veridical identity---an often turbulent  balance of how we see and feel about ourselves [our subjective self] versus how others see us [our objective self]. Ideally, they should augment and reinforce each other. However, this is not often the case as we tend to pamper and imbibe ourselves with positive aspects of the former but often fear and avoid negative aspects of the latter. Unfortunately, the former is more prone to aberration by delusions and disease.<br /><br />In his pool-hopping Lancaster tries to seduce a young woman half his age, tries to recapture an old flame he previously renounced, and has a weird encounter with a couple of elderly nudists, among other things. Upon sporadic query throughout this film his wife and kids back home are doing just fine and he is eager to return, but only via this creative and adventurous route. Some of the protagonists we bump into in this journey include Oscar winner Kim Hunter [A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, 1951], the always-attractive vet Janice Rule [with Brando in THE CHASE, 1966], Diana Muldaur [remember her two Star trek episodes in 1968] and even a not-that-bad-looking Joan Rivers as a poolside pickup.<br /><br />Lancaster's encounter with a small boy alone near his waterless pool was an insightful characterization. The boy is home alone, his parents away. Despite the dry, neglected pool Lancaster convinces the boy to descend into the pool and pantomime swimming across with him. It seems nothing will deter the ever-optimistic  swimmer from accomplishing his goal. At the end, however, the boy, practical and concrete as are all his age, seems be aware of the futility of the swimmer's whim. The viewer seems to understand at this point that, unlike the boy, the swimmer is not cognizant of his isolation and solitude. You are left to wonder here whether the boy's ambivalence toward the swimmer results from the latter mirroring, at least in the boy's mind, his parents' tacit abrogation of him and their responsibilities to him.<br /><br />What is A swimmer?  Stripped of all that is corporeal for the buoyancy needed to accomplish his task with ease but rendering him open to exposure and attack,  as all swimmers are usually equal and indistinguishable in form and function---though not ability---now open game for prejudgement and denouncement regardless of class or status. A swimmer has to come out into the open to parlay his practice.  A swimmer is also a user---a user of wonderful physical laws for personal  enjoyment and physical benefit.  A swimmer must also stay on or near the top of his medium lest be crushed or collapsed by these same laws which do not permit descending too deep or rising from the depths too quickly. Obviously, the swimmer cannot be too bold or impulsive or be ignorant of the laws of his environ or he may be harmed or even perish. Though we can see a swimmer on the surface [arms, shoulders and back] there much of him that we do not see. He can easily hide and is always on the move---inconstant and surrepticious. It is only when the swimmer comes out of the water that we can clearly make out his face and underbelly.<br /><br />Who is THE swimmer? Abhorring of clouds and rain, both crowds and solitude, stagnation and interruption and having little regard for boundaries or privacy the swimmer is, among other things, an audacious exhibitionist [not in the prurient sense] and an escapist. In other words, a narcissist and a hedonist with an inflated sense of self, lacking in accountability for past or present actions. But with that ELMER GANTRY [1960] way about him he manages the subterfuge and win our sympathy for most of the film. The swimmer is not a bad guy, not evil or perverse, but just an absorbent product of where he came from and who got him here. And he is delusional, really believing he's a peach of a guy---great friend, cool dad, steadfast husband---aren't we all. The swimmer has many positive attributes: he is a passionate man, full of vigor, an eternal optimist, is friendly and has a sense of humor. But when the mud hits the fan people tend to steer toward individuals with another set of attributes---namely, courage, commitment, constancy and judgement.<br /><br />Lancaster, who late in his career often seemed miscast, was exquisitely cast here. Few stars can captivate a viewer with such evocative expression of eyes and face,  posture and delivery, than  Lancaster whose early-in-the-film  youthful insouciance and vigor, optimism and, of course, that perfect smile, turns the viewer into a sympathetic  ally not aware of who this guy is underneath.  Indeed, he does a wonderful job of deluding the viewer.<br /><br />The swimmer's final pool to cross in his journey is a public pool owned by an obnoxious couple he once knew. They degrade him by  insisting he pay his way through the pool just like anybody else.  With only his trunks on, and not carrying any money,  he further debases himself by asking for a handout from a stranger so he can enter the pool and complete the final leg of his obsession. The ending, where the humiliated Lancaster arrives back home only to find an empty, dilapidated structure---he pounds on the front door and nobody comes, rain pouring over the broken man---is stark and sad. At the end, the swimmer, in his symbolic unidirectional journey, comes to realize that his past actions, and their impact on those around him, are immutable. At the end, the swimmer finds out what many of us  would prefer not to know, or may never know---who he really is and what place in the world he really has.<br /><br />The score, by a pre THE WAY WE WERE and THE STING [ both 1973] Marvin Hamlisch, was melancholic and poignant and served the film very well carrying us through our developing disappointment of the swimmer and the eventual denudation of his character. The DVD has no extras.  It does include a trailer for the movie which is excellent.  Transfer and picture quality were excellent. Hopefully the Criterion Collection series will pick this one up some day and include the in-depth extras it deserves including some info about now-deceased author John Cheever and more about the great Lancaster.stagnation and interruption and having little regard for boundaries or privacy the swimmer is, among other things, an audacious exhibitionist [not in the prurient sense] and an escapist.

B0007YXQRI|5.0|I totally disagree with the prior review!  The DVD-A format does NOT specify that content be Dolby 5.1.  It is simply an extremely high bit rate format, that can be anything from 5.1 channels to simple (very high bit rate) two channel stereo.  So, if you love this music, AND have a player that will play DVD-A (not many do), then buy this version immediately.  It is a two channel stereo presentation at over 9Mb data rates which means it sounds EXACTLY like the original master tapes.  It has all of the analog feel of the original master tapes, with none of the standard CD corruption.  A must have if you love this music.
B000TGCR38|5.0|For those of you who have seen Soldaat van Oranje (Soldier of Orange), expect something like that... While Soldier was a more wide ranging story and more glamorous Black Book has those same gritty war realities, tragedies and victories. And as many reviews already said, the bad guy is not always determined by just his uniform or his country of origin. A word of warning, it is a Paul Verhoeven film in all its aspects. So expect it to be real, gritty, dirty and always honest.
B002XJZE6Q|2.0|Received the waste toner box and it appears to be a re-furbished item. It was sent loose in a ups box and not sealed as though it had come from brother directly. Also you can clearly see the rollers are not brand new. It was not listed as such on the item's page. One of the tabs that holds the roller in place is broken. It does not appear that it will interfere with the operation. The only reason I am not returning it is because the machine will not run without one, and the current waste toner box is full.    UPDATE: The item will be returned. When installed it causes an error message on the machine and it will not copy or print. I verified that this item was the problem by intalling another waste toner box from an indentical machine and it worked fine.

This short film has delighted me and my friends for awhile now via YouTube, but I gotta say that the experience is just all the more enhanced to watch it on the television in DVD quality. The humor is superb, as is the acting and storyline. Also, its nice to see something NOT end like a happy storybook. I look forward to seeing if they ever put out the full length movie as they've promised.
B0022W6L6G|4.0|I'm a little young to appreciate Fleetwood Mac when they were in their heyday, but I do remember my Mom and Dad playing their records continuously as a child.  Their music became a staple in our house as I was growing up with my sister.<br />I got this CD for my Mom and we had a great time listening to it together.  Stevie Nicks' voice is spellbinding and you can't help but tap along to \\"Tusk\\" and sing along to \\"Rhiannon\\".
B000W07EKW|4.0|The Bourne films suffer from the same problem as do the recent Bond offerings - the world has fundamentally changed. The old adversary, the Soviet Union, has gone, and so has the master terrorist Carlos \\"the Jackal\\", Bourne's protagonist. Therefore, any updating unavoidably means major changes in plot. However, I think the updating has gone rather well, certainly better than the Daniel Craig Bonds.<br /><br />In cartoons, the characters are completely indestructible. Think of Wil-E-Coyote in the Roadrunner cartoons. Jason Bourne is the equivalent of an entire Roadrunner cartoon, in that he has Wil-E-Coyote's apparently bottomless pit of ingenuity and finance and his ability to survive complete disaster, combined with Roadrunner's perpetual success in outwitting Wil-E (meep-beep!).<br /><br />So, given the complete impossibility of the whole enterprise, what makes these films so entertaining? Much of the credit lies with the excellent Matt Damon, who somehow makes into a living, breathing creature the character of Jason Bourne, the killing machine with no past, and, if various nefarious Washington types can help it, no future either. In addition, the one-man-against-the-system drama, especially a system gone bad with a fearsome apparatus and that apparently holds all the cards, is always a good story line - one tends to root fiercely for the little guy. If you want spectacular chases and fight scenes, forget James Bond, this is where it's all at - Bourne's ability to (almost literally) leap tall buildings with a single bound and demolish half-a-dozen armed assailants equipped only with a toothpick (okay, okay, I made that last bit up) is wonderful to behold. The last of the three films is especially good, as a particularly nasty CIA director is constantly outwitted by the ever-versatile and ingenious Bourne, and finally receives his come-uppance.<br /><br />As I say, all of this is as inherently absurd and cartoonish as Bond or Bauer, but I find it much more entertaining, and I hope that the proposed (and currently stalled) fourth Bourne film goes ahead.the proposed (and currently stalled) fourth Bourne film goes ahead.
B0035WTE2U|2.0|Now don't get me wrong. I am a fan of both Iron Man movies, having enjoyed them tremendously after seeing them in theaters, not on computers or bootlegs. And I am a big AC/DC fan, having bought most of their CD's, DVD's and concert tickets. But calling this THING a soundtrack album is an example of bait-and-switch, to say the least. I was excited about seeing the sequel, which I believed would contain a bundle of AC/DC tracks. Stephen King tried it years ago, loading his \\"Maximum Overdrive\\" with AC/DC songs, so I thought Jon Favreau would go one better, since his track record as a director far surpasses King's (as King would admit). I never left the theater for a snack or mid-movie bathroom break and, I admit, I no longer take notes when watching a movie, not since I retired from review writing. But I made an informal count of AC/DC songs, and I came up with two. I think I noticed the Clash and Queen, too, but neither of their songs is on the CD. And, unless they ran a dozen songs while I was exiting during the closing credits, very very very few of these AC/DC greatest hits was included in the movie. If people had trouble obtaining \\"real soundtrack albums\\" in the past, as I have seen, reading people's online reviews, they will have an even worse time in the future if movie companies are allowed to slap movie titles on the front of CD's that have little, if any, resemblance to the music that accompanied the motion pictures themselves. Does anyone else agree or have an explanation, other than the neverending chase of consumer dollars?
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Nas' feature on Damian Marley's \\"Welcome to Jamrock\\" album was one of my favorite tracks, so when I heard about this album it definitely piqued my interest.  This album definitely has a lot of appeal not only to hip hop heads because of the artists involved, but after listening to the album a few times, I feel like this album would have a lot of popular appeal if its singles got more airplay.  The beats and lyrics are definitely conscious and thoughtful but in no way too heavy or hardcore for the average person to listen and relate to.  The album's reggae and hip hop hooks are catchy in the same way, not too hardcore so as to alienate listeners but definitely not shallow-poppy.  If there was a way to introduce the pop-rap generation to meatier fare like Nas and broaden their world-music tastes to Damian Marley, K'Naan, and the like, this is the album to do it.  Since this hip hop/reggae hybrid album is one of the only of its kind, it's going to be sitting in my car's CD player for a long time.
B0037W68F4|4.0|Welcome back '60's psychadelia! I haven't heard a theramin since the last time I watched Plan 9 From Outer Space! Add a bit of sass, modern intellect & a pinch of Bowie & there you have it...I bought this record after seeing the guys perform on SNL & I'm glad I did. Poppy but unpredictable. Does that make sense???
B0001XALTG|5.0|I am absolutely fascinated with the pursuit of a better life of the main character, including his path of seeking self control and ambition. This movie achieves to combine the black comedy,intelligent dialogs. This movie is sincere, describes the problems and charisma of a group of junkies in the 80's Scotland. Kudos to all the actors and the director is superb. I also loved the soundtrack!
B000002L3P|4.0|Kenny Wayne is introduced to the world in this very entertaining debut album.  At 18 years old, he shows off more chops than many people who spend a lifetime at the craft.  As a child protegy, it's clear that Stevie Ray Vaughn is a major influence.  The whole album is solid but there isn't a lot of \\"wow\\" to this one.  Deja Voodoo and While We Cry stand out to me. I believe While We Cry was recorded in Kenny's home town of Shreveport at a festival called the Red Rvier Revel, but that could be wrong. It's a very good live performance and impressive when you think of how young he was when it was recorded.  The Jimi Hendrix cover is the best song for the singer, whose voice I could mistake for for the original.  I like Kenny's guitar work better in his following album \\"Troube Is\\", where you can hear his sound mature, but \\"Ledbetter Heights\\" is a must have for anybody who enjoys this guitar style...and if you like guitar, that's you.
B001HN69AY|4.0|It's 'supposed' to be weird & dreamlike, so don't take the plot too seriously.  Fans of this fantasy genre will likely enjoy it although it may fall short if you're in the mood for real depth.  Great visuals & special effects, the kind that make it worth rewatching just to catch more of the details.  I enjoyed it enough... and don't regret buying the DVD, although it's less than a 5-star in my collection as well.  Interestingly successful at adapting the storyline with other headline actors to accommodate finishing of the film after the untimely death of Heath Ledger.  As a fan of Johnny Depp, however, I am probably partial in saying I probably would've enjoyed it much more if JD had played the main character from start to finish.  Christopher Plummer brings nobility to the cast & Lily Cole is very easy on the eyes.  One missed opportunity - The bonus features didn't do much to enhance appreciation of the film as they do in some other DVD sets.  All in all, a valiant rescue of a film that may not have ever been released.  All members of the cast did a good job & complemented each other nicely.
B002RI9XOC|3.0|\\"Be Careful what you Wish for!\\"     Four siblings in turn-of-the century England (and a two-year-old baby called the Lamb) make the discovery of an unusual creature in a sand pit: the Psammead, or Sand Fairy.  Of course no adult would believe in it's existence or its super-magical ability to grant wishes--that is, one per day, which lasts (only) until sundown.  While the children's parents are on a (conveniently) extended visit to an ailing relative, the kids are left in the care of Martha and the Cook at their new home in the Kent countryside.      Since the children have no experience asking for wishes, they naturally make ridiculous ones or even worse--accidental ones. The Psammead lives up to his part of the bargain, but as in darker, adult literature, the kids come to regret each of their wishes--learning wisdom and common sense too late to benefit them at critical moments.  Wealth, Beauty, Wings, a live medieval castle and Native American Indians--somehow all five wishes turn out disastrously.     Now when Lady Chittenden's stolen jewels turn up in their mother's bedroom the children are hard pressed to find a creative and truthful resolution.  This is a cute but quaint tale which will amuse younger readers or those who enjoy bedtime chapter books. The author can not resist interjecting a few humorous asides and, as a Fabian, insists on slipping in her views on social reform.  All things considered it is a pleasant read, set in simpler, Edwardian times.
B001KVZ6FW|3.0|I enjoyed the movie; there were even parts that made me laugh, \\"Squirrel!\\"  But overall, the screenplay was sorta disjointed, and the plot line wasn't that good.  It was a very average movie, below my expectations for Pixar entertainment.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|An eternity ago, Bruce Willis was the wisecracking David Addison on a TV show called Moonlighting.  Few could have imagined that Die Hard (1988), would propel Willis to megastardom, and launch a new genre of action/adventure imitators.  The sequels, Die Hard 2 (1990), and Die Hard With A Vengeance (1995) followed, but as Willis continued a colorful film career, the prospects for a fourth John McClane adventure seemed slim.  Fortunately, Live Free or Die Hard (2007) happened.  The 52 year old Willis, defies time, with an impressive, kickbutt performance, that leaves you wondering why it took so long, for something this good to happen.<br /><br />Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), a disgruntled computer security expert, is engaged in compromising key computer networks, and killing the hackers that have unknowingly been helping him.  McClane is still a NYC cop, but time has brought changes, including divorce, and a daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who is too angry to have a conversation with him.  McClane is sent to bring in Matt Farrell (Justin Long), one of geeks on Gabriel's payroll, preventing him from becoming a fatality.<br /><br />Gabriel continues his attack on various key systems, and looks to close a loose end, targeting Farrell with a helicopter strike.  The action sequence in a tunnel is impressive, although a police car taking down the chopper is too much.  Gabriel's girlfriend Mai Linh (Maggie Q), a computer tech and martial arts expert, is sent to manage the takeover of a power plant, and has a spectacular tussle with McClane in an elevator shaft.  Things get personal between McClane and Gabriel, as the terrorist grabs his daughter Lucy.  FBI deputy director Miguel Bowman (Cliff Curtis), provides law enforcement support, that is always a few steps behind.<br /><br />Directed by Ted Wiseman (Underworld), Live Free or Die Hard does a pretty good job of capturing the spirit of the Die Hard series, over the top adventures, with a larger than life hero, where realism is not that big a deal, as long as a certain level of credibility is maintained.  McClane is older, wiser, and as irreverent as ever, although with his advanced age and lack of technical savvy, the emphasis on youth is clear.  \\"That guy\\" Matt Farrell, makes a quirky, atypical sidekick.  Thomas Gabriel, doesn't have the gravitas of a Hans Gruber, but he makes a pretty formidable baddie, despite his youth.  And daughter Lucy is quite the spitfire.  The stunts, action sequences, and special effects, are up to par, with just the right touch of excess.  Fans of the franchise, should not be disappointed.<br /><br />The two disc version has a nice set of extras, including a commentary with Bruce Willis, Len Wiseman, and editor Nicholas de Toth, and a nice assortment of making of featurettes.  What happens next with the venerable John McClane, remains to be seen, but let's just hope that he has not yippee ki-yayed for the last time.ero, where realism is not that big a deal, as long as a certain level of credibility is maintained.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|it is a wonderful movie even though it made me cry through a box of tissues    anyone who loves animals should see this heart wrenching movie
B000GIXEIG|5.0|On the whole, I am greatly pleased by \\"Beowulf & Grendel\\".  The movie is performed from the point of view of one living in the time of Beowulf (~A.D.480).  Life was hard, short and brutish.  In the struggle for survival, people then were generally hostile toward others different from themselves.  This intolerance sets the stage for murder, vengeance, and ultimately compassionate respect.    I liked this movie because it turns the heroic fantasy, a classic of English literature, into a more believable and useful morality tale.  As such, it provides something closer to what might have actually happened than what the original legend evolved into.    I give the movie five stars and would defend it against some criticisms:    - dialog littered with expletives: Gee, I really can't imagine anyone used to bloodshed and death to refrain from such colorful speech.  - unattractive people: Sorry, people of the fifth century are not well known for their insistence on grooming and personal hygiene.  - movie was boring (compared to 2007 w/ Angelina Jolie) - well, you can have blood above your shoulders, or below your navel, but not at the same time.  Pick one.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This movie is very good but I would recommend buying it on Blu-RaY as it is the only way to get the true feel of the vibrant colors.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|love this book, I have read 6 of them and now I'm on the 7'th one. Wish everyone would see my point on it but you can't please everybody.
B0025KW29U|5.0|I have been looking forward to seeing this since I heard about, but waited for it to be released on blu-ray. This is something that Joss Whedon made during the writer's strike because he was bored. He got some very capable actors to take on the roles of his characters and wrote some catchy songs. I told my wife about this, but she is always iffy abou the things I like, our tastes are very different, and we sat down to watch this. We both enjoyed this very much and liked the music, too. After watching it once, I showed it to my kids, who all enjoyed it. After seeing it for the second time, my wife asked me to get the [[ASIN:B001M5UDH2 Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog]].<br /><br />This movie is campy and whimsical. My biggest problem with this movie was that it was only 42 minutes long. Give me some more.
B0039SFKSW|5.0|Omega is every bit as good as the 1st Asia album. The band is playing together, not individually. The groups harmony is simply incredible. If you liked the old stuff in 1982, you will love this album.I would hope the band tours North America with this solid album. If you liked the old stuff from Asia, this is a must purchase.
B000VECAEO|4.0|The final season. In hindsight, I guess it was time to end it after watching the final season. While there are many great episodes (especially the Merv Griffin espisode), it would appear that the steam had run out on one of my favorite shows of all time. This begs the question; was Seinfeld the best comedy ever? Compared to Cheers-that is a healthy debate to have. I know that a number of reviewers have thought that the show slowed down after Larry David left. While I missed his unique writing, I feel strongly that show became better without  Jerry opening on stage. I have seen his standup act and don't find it funny at all. That aside, any Seinfeld fan has to have the final season.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|An absolutely brutal but realistic look at the Pacific Theater of WWII. I graduated with a double major, part of which was in history that covered WWII, and I've always been fascinated about that era. I've read both of the books and have been immensely impressed that they were able to convey the feel of the books.     The reviews hitting it for \\"having too much sex\\" or the fact they don't like spielberg, should go watch disney films. They come here with an agenda and disrespect what veterans have done for this country for a religious and political agenda.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|I have seen the movie version of Phantom of the Opera over 30 times, 21 times in the theatre during it's run in 2004-2005.  I must say that I have not really seen it until watching it on Blu-ray.  What a difference in picture quality and with so many costumes and sets in Phantom, not to mention Mr. Butler's beautiful eyes, until you see it on Blu-ray, it just can't be truly appreciated.  So for the POTO fans of the movie out there...if you haven't seen it on Blu-ray...GET IT!! WATCH IT!! AND LOVE IT!! all over again.
B003JYOEYM|2.0|This was quite a pathetic undertaking.     The acting qualifies as marginally better than mediocre.     The special effects are extremely weak and very under-done for today's quality of movies.    The plot was very thin and barely held my attention. I checked Facebook and Reddit several times throughout the movie.    Don't waste your time and money.
0439023483|4.0|this one kept me up...needing to read more to figure out the next move!! i loved it. Suzanne did a ggreat job and i cant wait to read the next installment mockingjay!!
B0036EH3X4|5.0|To those who say it was all just a dream, obviously you didn't pay any attention when Christian spoke to Jack. To try not to get heavy into spoilers, just re-watch that scene and tell me how the hell that means it was all a dream when he specifically states that it was the most important time of his life and that some died before and long after him. The plane wreckage sequence during the credits was just added by ABC in order to let people decompress after the finale before the local news. At least have the decency to watch the episode before declaring the entire series a farce.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|i have read my fair share of books and these are wonderful. city of glass i read in 9 hours straight!
B000EULJLU|5.0|The album is amazing.  Like all good progressive music, it takes a few listens to  get all the songs.    1 Vicarious - Amazing song about violence, generally considered the star of the CD. Vicarious has some of the best guitar work you'll ever hear.  5/5    2 Jambi - Starts off with a great riff.  Near the middle there is a breath taking guitar solo.  Great bass 5/5    3 Wings for Marie (Part 1) - This is the intro for \\"10,000 Days\\".  It is a lot slower than the first two songs.  The beginning makes me think of Pink Floyd, for some reason. Over 11 minutes long.  4/5    4 10,000 Days (Part 2) - The song starts off slowly.  This is one of Tool's most thoughtful songs.  It is about Maynard's mother.  10/10 (This song takes a few listens)    5 The pot - Starts off with Maynard showing off his singing skills.  The song is overall weaker than the other songs on the album, but has a hook to it that makes up for lack of technicality.  Nice guitar solo. 4.8/5    6 Lipan Conjuring - This is an interlude.  I am not sure of it's meaning or purpose.  It sounds like some kind of native ritual.  I would give this a 3.5/5 but I am a fan of interludes and their artsy stuff... You might not like it.      7 Lost Keys (Blame Hoffman) - This song is the intro to \\"Rosetta Stoned\\".  It is mostly art not so much music until the end of the song.  During the last minute or so, you hear voices talking about how \\"the patient won't talk\\".  4.5/5    8 Rosetta Stoned - This song starts off hard and heavy.  The vocals are rapidly telling the story in first person, of a man who was abducted by aliens.  I believe this is actually a story about a man who was \\"Stoned\\".  This is possibly the best drumming on the album. Also the heaviest song on the album.  This song is over 11 minutes.  5/5  (This song has excessive swearing, so watch out) (If you care)    9 Intension - This one is very artsy.  The first time I heard it, I didn't like it at all.  It grows on you a lot.  Don't give up on it.  4.5/5    10 Right in Two - Nothing weird about this one.  Great bass, and guitar.  Also this is some impressive drumming. 5/5    11 Viginti Tres - Very weird song.  The first time I heard it I had to look up the writing credits because I thought I heard a little Trent Reznor on this.  (Nine inch Nails).  This song is quite artsy.  It is like \\"(-) Ions\\" from Aenima.  There is some vocals near the end, but you can't really tell what he is saying, and I'm pretty sure it isn't in English or German.  4.5/5      The album is great.  The only thing that is lesser about it is the interlude \\"Lipan Conjuring\\", I didn't find it as strong as the interludes on \\"Lateralus\\" or \\"Aenima\\".  Like all of the Tool albums, this will take a few listens to get used to.  4.9/5      Ok now for the warning.  The packaging is amazing.  It comes with little stereoscopic eyeglasses, they are attached to the artwork.  When you set the album on the table, and look through the glasses, while turning the pages of the booklet it comes to life.    The glasses on mine had a little extra glue on them... When attempting to get the CD out of the little paper thing it is held in (I know.. I hate those too) the glasses went down onto the artwork.  I then pulled them up, so I could get to the CD, the glue stuck on the back of the booklet and ripped a tiny piece of it up.  It is hardly noticeable, but be careful.   Also because of the paper packaging (for the CD) it is really easy to scratch.  So after you get it out CAREFULLY, put it in an empty CD case, do NOT put it back in the \\"10,000 Days\\" CD slot.

A female friend had told me that it was pretty slow going, but I found the film a gripping, well-paced story, beautifully acted and directed.<br /><br />But then, I will confess that I would happily watch Emily Blunt read from the phone book.  What a stunner!  What a subtle and intelligent actress!  What I wouldn't give to meet her!  I hope we'll be seeing much more of her in many more films to come...<br /><br />This is also a case where the DVD brings enhancements over the film shown in theaters.  I recommend that viewers watch the Special Features first (saving only the deleted and extended scenes for later), to get a feeling for the background of the film, before you view it.<br /><br />Opulent locations, sets, and costumes take the proceedings up another notch.<br /><br />Really, this is fine viewing for Anglophiles, royalists, costume drama buffs -- and anyone pining for a genuinely affecting love story.  Highly recommended.
B000002OHF|5.0|Wishbone Ash is probably one of the best rock bands from the early 70's.  The fact that they never received the mainstream success they should have can probably be attributed to the complete commercialization of the music industry and the shift from true musicianship to hairspray and spandex.  Wishbone can be credited with \\"inventing\\" the dual guitar harmonies that many people didn't hear until the Allman Brothers came around.  This is a band for guitar lovers, and this is an album for those who truly appreciate classic rock.
0790749815|5.0|Great film.  You got to have it if you love CG.  That house they made for the film is beautiful.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I bought this CD because it contains four songs that are hard to find or at least find in a complete studio recording format. I'm speaking of Hey Jude, Ballad Of John And Yoko, Get Back and Long and Winding Road. The first two were released only as singles. Back in the day I bought them as 45's and they never appeared in any LP formats except maybe in compilation albums. The second two were also released as singles I think but also appeared on the Let It Be album in a somewhat shortened version and performed live on a roof top. The Let It Be version of Get Back was especially disappointing because the song is noticeably shorter than the 45 version. It's almost as if they felt obligated to add it to an album to give the popular song more exposure. Say, does anybody know how much my old 45 versions of the above tunes might be worth?

B000E41MRC|3.0|\\"Triumph of the Will\\" is simply terrifying for many reasons, not the least of which is its applicability to modern America.  This film is basically a training manual for the Obama administration's propaganda machine.  If you doubt that claim, take this test:  In Hitler's speech, replace the word \\"Jews\\" with \\"Tea Party,\\" and suddenly Hitler sounds like a Democratic Party spokesman and/or MSNBC commentator.  I can't think of a horror movie that's more frightening.

B000BMTG8E|5.0|The book arrived quickly and in the condition described.  Possibly best of all, the book looked exactly as pictured.  The only drawback was that the seller did not respond to an email sent to her before I bought the book inquiring for more information about the condition.  Despite this, I would buy from this seller again.
B000O77SRC|3.0|This is the first time I have seen this movie but did see the latest Die Hard movie.  I found the language to be very expletive driven.  I have seen other action movies which didn't have such a bad vocabulary. I bought the movie because I liked Live Free or Die Hard.  I  liked the Bruce Willis character much better in the sequel. I actually bought this film to see Alan Rickman.  Mr. Rickman was so good as Hans Gruber. I can see why he was hired as a bad guy in some further movies (yes, I know he played villains on stage but I didn't see them).

B0012QE4Q2|4.0|\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is an exciting period costume drama, very loosely based on King Henry VIII's relationship with the Boleyn sisters Anne and Mary, members of an ambitious family associated with the Royal Court, and derivative of Philippa Gregory's novel of the same name.<br /><br />In 16th Century England, power politics are a family blood sport, in which the goal is to get close to the King, and stay close by any means necessary. When the dashing and handsome Henry VIII (Eric Bana) pays an official visit to the Boleyns, the family schemes to draw his attention to pretty, ambitious and eligible elder daughter Anne (Natalie Portman in full vixen mode). Through an unfortunate accident, the King instead becomes interested in plainer but honest younger daughter Mary (a superbly sympathetic Scarlett Johansson). When the two daughters are invited to court, they end up in competition to replace Henry's aging, barren queen. It is a high stakes game that the brazen Anne will do anything to win, in which the fate of the entire Boleyn family is very much at hazard.<br /><br />The story falls short of historical accuracy, but many viewers are likely to be caught up in a fascinating historical melodrama, filled with a solid cast in colorful costumes, lush sets and lots of authentic location shooting. Ultimately, the movie turns on the complex relationship between the two sisters, who become bitter rivals but somehow never quite stop being sisters. Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson as Anne and Mary are fun to watch, and the story generates plenty of suspense before its dramatic ending. \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is highly recommended as good entertainment. The DVD includes some nice extras.

However if you are an aspiring artist that seeks to sharpen their representational skills I definitely recommend this.   I've been wanting to get better at drawing portraits, yet alone facial expressions.  Drawing on the computer is fine, but I also like having something 3 dimensional to hold and look at even if my reference is 2 dimensional. After flipping through the book once I already know this material will be highly valuable because it has a broad range of facial expressions. E.g.: age, gender, and ethnicity.
0385528752|5.0|I just finished reading \\"Switch\\" How To Change Things When Change Is Hard by Chip Heath and Dan Heath, and have to say that this is probably one of the best books I have read on the mechanics of change.  If you're interested in making personal, corporate or societal change, this is a book you will want to read.<br /><br />The authors do a fabulous job of breaking down change into three specific areas referred to as the Rider (our logic), the Elephant (our emotions) and the Path (our environment).  What is so wonderful about this book is that it's not just theory.  There are real world practical examples of change in a variety of situations that any of us can relate to.<br /><br />I've always been convinced that the emotional aspect of changing plays a huge role, more so than the intellectual aspect and Switch has solidified that belief for me, while identifying the core problems i.e. identity, clarity and environment.  The authors also point to the positive aspects of making a switch by looking for the bright spots of what is working, celebrating good behavior and directing the path to reinforce good habits that advance the mission.<br /><br />A unique feature of this book are the clinics at the end of each section where you can test what you've learned and compare your ideas with the real life solutions in each clinic.  If you need to get some changes started in your own life or in a group setting, you should definitely consider this great book.
B001DHXT2A|4.0|THE INCREDIBLE HULK    I remember not so long ago when a film by Ang Lee hit the theaters that was called simply \\"Hulk\\", and I liked unlike a lot of others apparently. I still to this day can not see why people did not like that film because I thought it was really good. The character driven emotional study of this man/creature was perfect. Lee did a great job with the film in my opinion and while it was not a classic was still very good. But the overwhelming out cry for another so called \\"better' Hulk film was so much that they made this one. New cast, new crew, and even new Hulk were added to this one to please those who did not care for the first one. What they got was a film that was equally entertaining in my opinion I thought this was just as good as the last one and neither surpassed the other. They are two very different films and takes on the character and for that I view them separately and do not compare the two.    This film is all about Banner [Edward Norton] trying to get in touch with some one who may be able to help get rid of his big green curse. It is in his search that the military can close in on him during their search. It is here that General Ross [William Hurt] and his number one soldier Emil Blonsky [Tim Roth] take their first failed shots at the Hulk. It is also here that Emil begins his obsession with battling him again. The story is basically your seek and destroy story from this point on with Ross's daughter trying her hardest to help Bruce as much as possible. So let the battles begin as they say with so many sides going against each other, and poor Hulk is caught in the middle, all Hulk want do is smash.    Director Louis Leterrier really brought a whole other style to this film and quickens the pace up a bit as action is found throughout the film. To me both of the films are on the same level as I enjoyed both about the same, so I can't say that Louis did the better job. But if you want more action this one is for you as Zak Penn's script called for more action. Still the story is very fun and all the performances are great as well, Roth in particular. Tim Roth struck me as the perfect villain for this film and I really wish he would get more roles in theatrical films. Edward Norton was great as well as the new Bruce Banner and played the role perfectly. I still feel that the script could have beefed up Banner's character a little more so Norton could properly portray him, I felt the character [not performance] was a little underdeveloped. Still I really feel that Roth was the sow stealer here, he did a great job.    Liv Tyler and William Hurt are great as the daughter and father Ross in this film, I remember never being a huge fan of Tyler back in the day but I have come to like her a now. I think it is because she looks just like some one I know [who I dislike], oh well. Also while every one in this film is great I must say seeing Lou Ferrigno in this was classic, as was Stan Lee, Robert Downey Jr reprising his Tony Stark character [Avengers here we come, also in an opening scene Cap's shield is visible], and the LEGENDARY Rickson Gracie appearing as Banner's Aikido Instructor. I was super excited to see that as was my brother, loved it.    Of course the special effects for the film are top notch as the two monsters that go at it on here look amazing, also the Hulk doesn't look cartoonish and Abomination looks great. As do all of the fights, explosions and such that come with this type of film. But I think the biggest story that came out of this was the comparisons between the two Hulk films. Like I said earlier I like both of them about the same, they are two very different films with very different styles. This three disc addition is packed full of all kinds of special features and is well worth the price of purchase, or at least I think so. I have to say I really enjoyed the commentary by the director and Tim Roth. I recommend watching both Hulk films as I enjoyed both myself. Also there areall kinds of features on this set so enjoy.

B002ZG98Z0|2.0|My verdict? Not much sex, hardly any city.<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews (most of which weren't pretty) prior to Friday, I was expecting the worst. But it wasn't that bad.<br /><br />I felt that the problem lied in the transfer of locale from Manhattan to Abu Dhabi. When I heard that part of the film would take place there, I thought it would be along the lines of the Mexican respite the ladies take in the original film. However, I suspect that filming abroad seemed like a good way to prevent the photographers that pervade the outdoor filming in Manhattan from spoiling any of the film's secrets. I believe some decoy scenes were even shot in the first film for that very reason. Buut Sarah Jessica Park always said that the fifth lady on Sex and the City was New York. Here she is all but missing entirely and in turn the film loses a lot of the dynamic that made the original HBO series--and even the 2008 film--work on so many levels.<br /><br />Instead what we have is a film that is essentially a parade of costume changes, one that shallowly looks at the cultural differences between women in the East and West. (What results from this is a couple of cringe worthy scenes where Samantha can't believe how oppressed Eastern women are, which, in the end, leads to the notion that women, no matter what part of the world they're from, have more in common than then they do differences.)<br /><br />Also, Cynthia Nixon's character, Miranda, is underutilized this time. While she showed growth in the first film, this round she makes the decision to quit her job early on in the film and that's where it ends for her. Being thousands of miles away from New York, she (and we, the audience) doesn't really get the gravity of her situation, and don't see her reconcile her new life.<br /><br />But for all of the negatives (and there are many), there are a number of positives, too. A good friend of mine said that he felt the best part of the film was Charlotte's character. I think I agree. Here it is Charlotte's opportunity to grow. I won't spoil it for you, but these scenes involving the mother of two are some of the most poignant in the entire film.<br /><br />This weekend there was a bit of an upset at the box office when Shrek the Third bested Sex and the City 2 for the top spot at the box office. I think that speaks more on the power of family films than any disenchantment with the Sex and the City franchise. After all, the latter's fan base is fiercely loyal, and a couple of bad reviews aren't going to deter them from catching up with their favourite girlfriends.<br /><br />Even though this film was largely disappointing, I still hope that they can learn from their mistakes and film a third one.rtunity to grow.

B002WY65W4|5.0|I was both skeptical and excited about Zombieland.  The last zombie movie was Land of the Dead, a poor comparison to Zombieland in many ways.  First of all, Zombieland is the first zombie movie that I've seen that is mainly a comedy and not so much a horror or survival movie.  This becomes apparent during the opening of the film when the audience is exposed to the rules Columbus uses to survive in the United States of Zombieland.<br /><br />While a comedy, the film first appears to be a horror flick.  This was made evident to me when my in-laws refused to watch past the opening credits because of the gore involved when zombies chase the fatties and eat jugular veins. For those who don't like gore, most of it is contained in the opening minutes of the film making for a sick opening - but stick with the film and you will be rewarded.<br /><br />Finally, the film isn't as cliched or full of stupid humor as I had worried.  Almost every joke, gag and laughable moment is mostly original with a Family Guy-esque feel.  (Some things, while hilarious, are completely random.)  This helps to build the characters and propel the story well, though.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|Only get the original BBC David Attenborough version. This is why we've all come here to post reviews for this one - to make sure everyone gets the best possible version of this incredible series, and not the second hand re-dubbed Oprah one.  David's narration is the best and....i caught an episode of Oprah on the discovery channel and it was totally inferior. Me and all my friends watched the original BBC one here in America like the OG's that we are and now we can buy it like its meant to be seen!    \\"Life\\" is the best nature documentary series I've ever seen.  What it all comes down to is the quality of footage that a nature show contains and LIFE contains the greatest footage I've even seen.  Yes, it even surpasses the great \\"Planet Earth.\\"  After watching all of LIFE I went back to watch Planet Earth again and, while its still an absolutely INCREDIBLE series, i became more attuned to the numerous ways in which Life surpasses it. This is a must see for everyone.
B001MEJY8W|4.0|MARTYRS is an exceptional experience for various reasons.  I have no plans of getting into the plot too deeply, because ruining this movie's surprises would be tantamount to a cinema crime.  Would I would like to focus on are some exceptional elements.  This movie delves into realms not normally touched by the horror genre.  The violence is extreme and over the top, but it has a reason behind it: Albeit, a twisted and sick reason.  However, it is not mindless violence without cause just for the sake of \\"goring\\" someone to death.  I am not a huge fan of gore.  However, this film uses it properly to convey its intended message.  MARTYRS is very successful in making the audience think hard about the questions it puts forth.  I find it terribly interesting that the \\"bad guys\\" seem to all come from the upper class of society and for some reason they felt distinctly Nazi-like.  The film is still tumbling around in my head as I try to come to grips with its intended message.  I find much ambiguity, but I also find pointed questions and fearful revelations.  Another issue of note is the near absence of curse words.  American horror is filled to the brim with \\"F-Bombs\\" and all other variety of offensive language.  MARTYRS seems to have no use for such language.  It does not need it.  It is also proof that superior suspense and horror films can be made without the need for constant cursing.  I found it very refreshing.  There is some mild nudity, but it is not sexual in any way.  The focus of the film is its stunning and shocking visuals and the message it is trying to convey.  The truth is:  This is not a \\"happy time\\" film experience.  If you want to feel good, do not watch this film.  (Watch THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE instead)  If you want to be spoon fed, do not watch this film.  If you want to think and test your analytical powers and your ability to pay attention to nuances, this is the film for you.  NO WAY SHOULD ANY CHILD SEE THIS MOVIE!!!  MANY ADULTS SHOULD NOT SEE IT EITHER.  Make sure you can handle it.SHOULD NOT SEE IT EITHER.  Make sure you can handle it.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|This album is a continuation of the Metropolis album.  The works do tell a story, albeit a story that not everyone will appreciate.  The story is of a futuristic society where humans and androids collide, or is it a fight by those in power to oppress the underclass to maintain superiority.  The music is a combination of lyrical hip hop, techno beats, and movie score orchestration.  Who would have thought it would work?

B000VUQ4HW|5.0|Given all the fuss about them in the last few years, you would think that vampires movies and TV had only just been invented. But they've always been fascinating to moviemakers -- and \\"Nosferatu\\" was the original vampire movie, even predating Bela Lugosi's \\"Dracula.\\" It's haunting, creepy and sometimes bizarre.<br /><br />It's a very loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic story, \\"Dracula\\" -- a young real estate agent named Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) is sent to the Carpathians to sell a mansion to a reclusive nobleman named Count Orlock (the sublimely creepy Max Schreck). Locals refuse to go near the castle, strange creatures roam nearby, and Orlock makes weird comments about \\"your precious blood!\\"<br /><br />Yeah, you know the drill -- Orlock is obviously a vampire who has a craving for Hutter's hearty Germanic blood, and Hutter's troll boss knows what he is. Hutter soon realizes what Orlock is, but he's too late to stop the vampire from departing from his ancient castle and going to Hutter's own hometown. In true vampire tradition, he also leaves a trail of corpses behind him -- and there's only one way to stop him.<br /><br />Given the current manias about stuff like \\"Twilight\\" and \\"True Blood,\\" it's both refreshing and humbling to see that the best vampire movies are also some of the oldest. \\"Nosferatu\\" is only loosely based on Bram Stoker's novel (though closely enough that it was ordered destroyed by Stoker's widow), it's absolutely soaked in gothic atmosphere and creeping horror.<br /><br />Oh sure, \\"Nosferatu\\" has the overacting and goofy makeup of the silent era, especially from any actors who are not Schreck. But F.W. Murnau sketched together some truly brilliant direction here -- he coats \\"Nosferatu\\" in creepy silhouettes and freaky moments of sorrow and terror (note the symbolism of the venus flytrap!).<br /><br />As for the vampire himself, Max Schreck simply RULES this movie. The other actors are decent, but Schreck is simply sublime as the rat-toothed, clawed, ghoulish Orlock, and manages to give one of the most subtle performances in any silent film. He's literally the antithesis of the sparkly angsty teenyboppers of current vampire crazes.<br /><br />\\"Nosferatu\\" is the original vampire movie, and remains one of the best almost ninety years after its release.

193413712X|3.0|Upon finishing \\"Tinkers\\", I was disappointed that I didn't feel the same way as so many others who were obviously captivated by this novel.  After all the hype, I couldn't wait to pick up this book since it is always great to see a book build through word-of-mouth versus the heavy marketing campaign by a big publisher.<br /><br />In spite of all my optimism, I finished this book with a flat feeling that in spite of some wonderful moments and beautiful writing, the end result did not live up to the buzz and was more like a boat ride in choppy waters --- there were some highs and lows with an overall uneven and choppy ride.  As George Washington Crosby lies dying in his New England home surrounded by his family, Harding traces George's patriacharchal roots back two generations.  Harding's most poignant writing revolve around George's father epileptic fits, especially the Thanksgiving dinner that was interrupted suddenly and left George with a terrible physical and psychological wound.  These masterful moments did set such a high bar that the letdowns seemed just as striking as Harding drifted into more tedious passages, particularly those passages around the precision around George's clock fixing.<br /><br />I can understand how \\"Tinkers\\" might strike the chord for many, my biggest issue that there were several other books released last year that were far superior, \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" and \\"In Other Rooms, Other Wonders\\" to name just two.  While I wouldn't enthusiastically recommend this novel, being less than 200 pages and given its several flashes of brilliance, it is worth the limited time required.  Harding's command of English makes him an author to keep an eye out for and likely means his next novel will be greatly anticipated.
B003E48AYC|3.0|Don't be fooled.  Tim Burton's version of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is not another film version of the Lewis Carol classic, rather it's more of a sequel.  The premise is that on the day she's proposed to by a upper class nitwit, Alice runs off and falls back down the rabbit hole and returns to Wonderland.  Unlike her first trip to Wonderland in which all the weird creatures treated Alice quite cruelly, Alice is now a hero of sorts because she's the only one who can defeat the evil Red Queen.    Unfortunately that pretty much sums up the entire movie.  This isn't as artistic statement as much it is a high concept re-imagining.  I am sure the thinking behind this movie was something along the lines of, \\"Tim Burton directing 'Alice in Wonderland' with Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter.  Who cares if it's any good as long as the ticket's sell.\\"  Yep, this movie is pretty much mass marketing, and if you think I'm exaggerating, Hot Topic was selling merchandise for this movie four months before it's release (Nov. 09).  This is not a terrible movie by any means, but it's not a great one either.  I did enjoy some of the performances, especially the manic March Hare.  Visually, the movie is quite impressive.  Just too bad it doesn't have a stronger narrative.    As far as the Blu Ray aspects go the transfer looks and sounds terrific.  And being a Disney release you can bet you're going to have to sit through more than enough advertisements.      Peace.

They begin as newly graduated students and we watch each of them take their own course, never quite letting go of each other and never quite pulling it together.<br /><br />David Nicholls writes this novel almost as if it is a screenplay. The dialogue is crisp with sarcastic banter. The scenes are rather vividly described, though not nearly often enough, in my opinion. He lets the character's conversation present the scene around them quite a lot of the time. This gives the story a bit of a choppy feel.<br /><br />I also did not care for the many abrupt changes at each chapter that make the reader ponder what happened in the past year. Rather than give a summary of what had happened over the course of each year, the chapters end and the next chapter is suddenly on another subject altogether. I suppose it is meant to give you the feel of a year having passed and much having changed, but the feeling that I had to \\"catch up\\" and assume what I had missed in the course of that year was distracting for me. It's certainly a clever premise to revisit the same day year after year, but I didn't enjoy the way it was executed.<br /><br />The story itself is very somber. I had expected a character study and got just that, but a sad, if not realistic one. I half expected there to be some romance but this would better be described as a look at the frustration of relationships.

0684833395|5.0|This book to me is the perfect novel.  Forget even the fact that it deals with war, it raises a lot of excellent points about life in general, through the satiric, repetitive, and absurd format and dialogue.  In life we notice that a lot of stupid and terrible things just happen, and they do all the time.     Life is repetitive, irritating, absurd, and bad things happen for no rhyme or reason, which is part of Snowden's secrect.  Of course, this is magnified 1000 times during war time.  Seemingly normal people do horrible things, like when Yossarian realizes that the true crazy person is actually Aarfy, who is so even keeled that he is incapable of grasping his own evil or true danger ahead.      This book illustrates some of the frustrating realities of living in a satirical and roundabout way, which is what makes it so brilliant.  If you can find the absurd, ridiculous, and awful in world war II, which was actually fought for excellent reaasons, you can find it in a hospital, a school system, a church, or an office.  Someone could probably write an amazing catch 22 style book about hurricane katrina and its aftermath.      The wild and colorful characters are really exaggerations of people you know and see every day.  I do know people who procrastinate and bore themselves to death in order to avoid inevitable bad events, like Dunbar (me), or people who are so silly that they hid their true intelligence for a reason, like Orr, or opportunistic people who sell out humanity in their own way like Milo.  I even know what it's like to be more nervous and scared when something bad isn't happening than when something bad is, like Hungry Joe having nightmares only when he isn't flying missions.      I also am in awe of Joseph Heller's command of the English language and literature.  There are so many literary references that I miss and find out about later on.  You have to appreciate the skill in tying all of this together.  If he never wrote another book ever again it wouldn't even matter because honestly, this one is perfect in every way.

She is recognized as brilliant by her peers and by the committees who keep awarding her scholarships and academic prizes.  She has won the opportunity to spend the summer in New York city, living a glamorous life as a magazine junior editor.      All of the opportunities of the world are open to Esther.... and this fact absolutely paralyzes her.  She is terrified of making the wrong decision, of losing out on something by choosing something else.  She begins to feel that doing anything at all is futile and nothing in her life matters anyway.    When Esther is passed over for an elite summer writing course, her world begins to crumble.  She feels as though her life is slipping from her control, and she spends a great deal of time thinking about the various ways she could commit suicide.  It seems that drastic measures are required to calm Esther's troubled mind, and she finds them in an asylum for women.    I found the workings of Esther's mind to be fascinating.  In so many respects she seems like any young woman trying to find her place in the world and decide which path she will take and, by definition, which paths will be left behind.  The mental anguish she faces at participating in day-to-day life, though, is clear and beautifully written.  Esther is smart and amusing and terribly troubled, and it was devastating to read about her decline and her difficulties with simply living her life.

It is also interesting the John Grisham makes the statement the the Boomes are lawyers are \\"Officers of the Court\\" and obliged to uphold the laws - yet both parents take Teddy to a family shelter and advise spanish people (implied illegal aliens) on their rights (I wonder what part of the word Illegal John Grisham does not understand).

If you have any kind of Tube gear like simple music hall tube amp, audio nivana is inches away. Wait for the headphone to break-in, warm up the tubes. It sucks up a little bit more power than senhiesers, but it doesnt require Mark Levinsons to power them. Any simple 32 watt rated head phone amp will do the job. Any one complaining about lack of bass, go buy yourself a decent DAC and amp. IPODs doesnt do any justice to these great head phones.
B001AUKUS6|4.0|The first two albums from Ratt are a must own.Invasion was Ratt's second album and is best known for the staple hits,\\"you're in love\\" and \\"lay it down\\".This album is very similar to the first in that it's filled with catchy hooks,sexual innuendos and great choruses.The first four songs are great,but I thought \\"closer to my heart\\" and \\"between the eyes\\" were just a bit average.The album picks up steam again with the excellent sounding,\\"what you give is what you get\\" along with \\"got me on the line\\",\\"you should know by now\\" and the unforgettable \\"dangerous but worth the risk\\".I'm glad I got to see these guys play live.This is hair metal in it's true mid 80's heyday and well worth owning,especially if you're a fan of Ratt's earlier releases.
0688156819|4.0|I considered myself a big fan of Tim Burton.  From Pee-Wee to Charlie, and pretty much everything in between, I'm a fan of his films (Edward Scissorhands is, and always will be, my favorite film).  His artistry and strange sense of the spook adds a personal touch of quality that I'm finely in tune with.<br />Nevertheless, I never really had the opportunity to delve into his written works, so I decided to try this speciously harmless collection of poetry.  About a handful of poems in, I questioned whether it was really aimed at kids at all!<br /><br />Writers and filmmakers argue how hard it is to portray emotion and thought onto film, and trying to show Burton's definitely proves a point.  Though his films aptly convey the \\"huggable monsters,\\" his written work really get into his mind and leave you with disturbing mental images that his films usually don't.<br />I enjoyed the works for the most part; I guess I really wasn't ready to expect what this collection entails.  It's a perfect view into Burton's \\"light macabre\\" style, and the writing is simple, yet should be geared towards the teen-and-up crowd.
B000VDDES6|5.0|Along with a fantastic supporting cast, Will Ferrell is at his best. Seems that some of the humor just rocketed over the heads of a few of the negative reviewers. Oddly, with all its goofy hilarity, and through my tears of laughter, this movie really brought back that era with a kind of nostalgic poignancy. If you're a Ferrell fan or came of age in the seventies then do not miss this movie.
B002S0OBN2|3.0|OK, I admit it. I am a Phantom Phan to the core, and will probably go see the show once it opens on Broadway.  While the music of Love Never Dies is enjoyable, there are a few issues I have with the characters.  Consider for instance: Christine betrays not only one man (Phantom),but now Raoul as well, not once, BUT TWICE!  What kind of woman is she?  Is she worth the Phantom's longing?  She does not come across as likeable, nor really does the Phantom.  He seems callous and oblivious to the help the Giry's have given, and too obsessed with 'angelic' Christine.  And what of Raoul?  Poor guy-betrayed before his wedding day, then again by the paternity of 'his' son.  No wonder he's been driven to drink.  Christine still can't make up her mind!      Despite these characterizations, the music appeals.  The Beauty Underneath, and Love Never Dies stand out among the tracks.  I do like the rock for Beauty.  Suits the Phantom.  He's always had that rock 'n roll thing going on!  No, this probably will not rank as high on the 'must have' list as the original Phantom soundtrack, but is still worthy of a careful listen.
B0018LMZOE|4.0|This is definitely a well put together album. I would give it five stars, since nearly every single song on it is worth buying the album for, but I have to say that, for me, it has less replay value than other albums. Perhaps it's because I listened to it a whole lot, but after a while, the songs became predictable (moreso than usual) and would eventually get stuck in my head in a pretty bad way. Personal experience only.     Other than that, god damn, they certainly knew what they were doing when they made this one. Every song rivals the other, every songwriter shines his best. The instruments float around like a mist throughout the whole album. There's definitely something magical about it. A high shining beacon in the era of 60's psychedelic prog pop, or whatever the hell you want to call it.
B003LXT8YC|4.0|This is a very solid R&B collection with some real gems.  When listening to Amazon's samples, I almost didn't buy this.  I'm very glad that I decided to.  Mz. LaVette did justice to every song in this collection (well, maybe not so much on \\"Nights in White Satin\\") and really added her dimension.
3832791620|5.0|The master of the \\"indecisive moment\\" seemed to know just what he wanted when pulling together images for this project. \\"Eliot Erwitt: Personal Best\\" is a must for any photography lover or fan of life's funny moments. The printing and binding are the same quality one expects from a legendary house like teNeues. You will not be disappointed!     Other reviewers have mentioned the design of the book as a hindrance - for me, seeing the photographs printed large, full size, offers a chance to see what a real gallery print might look like, rather than a small, web / computer version of Erwitt's work that I have seen so many times online.     This collection has some of the best black and white street photography ever!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|this is it indeed, the greatest of all time has left us with one last gift.  regardless of personnal feelings that people may have this is a must see. micheal jackson was a gift to us all. this movie shows just how dedicated he was to his fans and his music and himself. he pushes himself beyond the limit most do. this film will keep you entertained the entire time, make you appreciate his talent, and make you miss him.
0385503954|4.0|I found that the movie was very thorough and from what I remember of the book, it's also very close.  The book, however, of course, does explain the story behind the vase that gets broken and things like that, but I'm not sure if it's any better or worse than the movie. So if you like reading things then read the book, but if you like watching the movies better then the movie is so close you might want to do that :)
B0037SQ3C6|4.0|I really enjoyed this recording.  The pianist has a nice touch and the engineers really conspired with the pianist to create a \\"dreamy\\" atmosphere.  It is kind of intoxicating and initially, very beautiful.    A person can really say that the Noctures are already pieces that really have a dreamy quality.  I cannot argue this, but compare this recording to Nelson Freire.  Freire does not capture (or perhaps intend to create this dreamy quality in all of the Nocturnes).    My only complaint is that this recording of Nocturnes ends up sounding like too much of the same thing.  It is an extremely beautiful disc to be lulled to sleep at bedtime.    For a more balance, perhaps too somber, but very beautiful rendition, try Arrau.  I believe that they are available as a Philips Twofer or in a five disc set of Chopin.  I must confess that I really love Arrau's versions of Chopin's works.
0060555661|5.0|Can a rewriting of a financial classic be worth reading? Absolutely. Graham might have been the greatest value investor of his time, but his prose could be dry. Jason Zweig stays faithful to the original, while offering modern examples of stock market hubris that Graham certainly would have nodded his head to. Although Graham and Zweig share a message, it's easy to distinguish the one's words from the other: besides, the book uses different fonts for each. Zweig's comments on the absurdity of the dot-com bubble are worth the price of the book itself. The message is timeless: look at a company's fundamentals, before you look at the fluctuations of its stock price. Understand that you're buying a piece of a business, not a spin on a roulette wheel. Above all, be disciplined. The vast majority of the book's readers won't do any of that, human nature being what it is, but the quiet truths of Graham's approach will outlast Jim Cramer and his ilk.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|A six year con job. This thing should have been a three hour mini-series with that ending.
0823016714|1.0|After leafing through this once it arrived, it became clear that for me this book was essentially useless, and I put it up for sale the next week.    Here's what made the book unusable for me:    The bulk of these expressions seem insincere and overly-exaggerated. These are not actors, but everyday people grimacing and mugging in front of a camera. There are not many 'real' emotions here, but mostly cartoony rubberface contortions, done by people who are not trained in subtlety conveying everyday emotion in front of a camera or audience. Some people may want this kind of thing, but I have a hard time seeing how these could be truly useful to any artist for real-world work.    The art 'examples' of how to interpret these images (also largely done by amateurs) serve absolutely no purpose and are quite distracting, as they are given more weight than the source art itself (!).    Worst of all, a bulk of the photos are badly lit, and poor adjustments were made for subjects with darker complexions. I was amazed many of the subjects were not lit to highlight what the book is supposed to be all about, facial expressions (?!). Often the strongest light source was situated on the top rear of the head -- yielding many completely flat photos.    Many of the best-lit facial poses stare directly into the camera (!). It's very rare that an artist ever needs to break 'the 4th wall' for their work, so these are also all a waste.    The author and his staff definitely put a lot of work into this book -- it's got a lot of different models and it's almost an inch thick -- but I need to be honest and say it really is a whole lot of nothing. At the end of the day, the best source for reference is a mirror by your table (like Disney animators do), or a quick camera phone pic of friend, to give you the emotion you need.
B001HN694K|5.0|Tim Burton has a unique conceptual vision as well as visual sense that just stands   out above the rest!  The man's work is instantly recognizable and is usually   associated with quality. Add to that, since the early 90's, he has found a   fellow bizarre bretheren and muse in Johnny Depp, who is arguably one of the   most versatile and original actors in the latter 20th Century or early 21st Century.  The two are simply magic together!  This project, the re-telling of the classic children's story of   \\"Alice In Wonderland\\", shows no lag in their magic and in fact,   adds new dimension to it. (-:  An ingenious mix of computer animation and live real time acting,  it really takes Tim Burton's already unique vision to another level!  The whole cast, including Helena Bonham-Carter (Burton's wife),   Ann Hathaway, the legendary Christopher Lee and others, all played   their roles magnificently! I dare say it, but this film is an instant classic   and will remain as the standard-bearer for future generations of children who   will watch it and become engrossed in the story, the special effects,   the costuming, the performances, etc., in the same way that the baby-boomers   who grew up with \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\" were.  I enjoyed watching this just as much as my little niece,   who I took to the theatre to see this did!     It's Thoroughly Entertaining & Timeless!
B0034C9CFK|3.0|This CD was a disappointment. I enjoyed Jackson's other CDs, but this one wasn't up to his norm. I have listened to it several times, and it's stil not growing on me.
B003BVK36Q|2.0|Bleak. This novel reminded me a lot of \\"The Spy Who Came in From The Cold,\\" LeCarre's 1963 masterpiece. All the spies are bad guys, with the Yanks ranked as worst and a maverick German as best, but it's impossible to like any of them. It's also impossible for me to like the main female character, Annabel, another in a long line of women as cipher that is a a hallmark of LeCarre's post-Smiley books. Why on earth would she fall in love with the mystery Muslim Issa? LeCarre doesn't both to tell or show us. Why on earth does the the banker Brue immediately fall for Annabel? Because she's beautiful? That's it? Really? How terribly...cliched? One longs for the handful of vivid women who populated the Smiley books -- minor characters all but interesting and real.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I was excited when I found out they were doing a TV series of the Sword of Truth books.  While I admit that the actual plots have been at the least, radically altered, the series generally stays true to the ideas and characters themselves from the books.  There have been so many half-assed series over the years (Flash Gordon for instance) that I hope it stays around for a good long time.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|Excellent entertainment.  Special affects are top notch and smoothly executed.  Solid plot, action and pace.  Well done.
0060853964|5.0|The book was in really good condition. It was a library book so there were markings on it. But the book it's self has a lot of life in it. And it was sent promptly and arrived in good time. I'm 100% satisfied with it.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Rework takes on the conventional wisdom put forth by project management books, management guides, and the conventional wisdom of business practices up to this point in time.<br /><br />The illustrations are great, and could almost be motivational posters to support each simplified, quick to read chapter.  As a small business owner who has wandered through the management practices of small, medium, and large companies, I have to say the ideas contained in Rework aren't revolutionary; they are common sense that we overlook on a daily basis in the name of maintaining the status quo.<br /><br />With an interactive, information-rich experience available to many people at the click of a button, tap of a screen or muttering into a headset, its easy to lose sight of the fact that business still involves humans.  People need rest, people need reasonable expectations, and above all people need to be able to fall back on basic, simple truths.  Rework provides a perspective on these simple ideas, and very solid reasonings behind each idea.<br /><br />Its been an inspiration, allowing me to move forward in my business practices in ways that I find far more productive and interesting.
B000002J0P|5.0|great condition and really fast delivery   I would purchase from this seller again...
B00008OE4W|4.0|I love this one. Lots of suspense, a few twists, some comedy, and even a little romance. Too bad there is so much swearing. That's the only drawback--parents, you will need to edit this before showing it to your kids! Love the characters, and this movie is one of Robert Redford's finest.
1849162743|3.0|I had been waiting, waiting, waiting for this book to be published just to get more of Larsson's intense writing...but was grossly disappointed. The first book (Dragon Tattoo) was truly a pageturner--intense, gripping, near-perfection in book form. The second (Played w/Fire) was not nearly of the same caliber. It was actually boring in spots, but some entire sections were brilliant. This last one (Hornet's Nest) is brilliant in the last 150+ pages. Prior to that it is needlessly detailed, a bit rambling and easy to put down and walk away from...except I wanted to know how it ended. That truly is the only reason I continued to read this book--I was 2 books into the trilogy and had to know the outcome. I'm sure Larsson would have edited this book differently had he had the time and it's unfortunate for us that he didn't; however, his art shone in the end.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I bought this a few years ago but still watch it whenever I'm feeling down and need a laugh or watch it just because with my girls. It's so worth the price and I feel it's the best DVD set I've ever bought! I love watching it with the commentaries, Michael Patrick King is great!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Alright, if you have followed the Winchester's since season 1, season 4 is just as good. It's a blast and it definately keeps you guessing through the plot. Some of it was kind of overkill, but as a whole, I would definately recommend buying this if you have enjoyed the series so far. The end will leave you dying to watch season five.
B001DD63UO|5.0|I bought this \\"clean version\\" for my 11-yr. old daughter, who primarily considers herself to be a Taylor Swift and Shania Twain fan. However, she now counts Pink as one of her favorite artists.  While the majority of the songs on this CD showcase Pink's bad-girl nature and strongly hint at a past filled with drinking, fighting and troubled relationships, the music is phenominal and FUN.  My wife was at first skeptical of this purchase, but now enjoys it at least as much as the rest of us.  The last song, Glitter in the Air, is an awesome contrast to the rowdy hits that precede it and really shows off the artist's superb vocal range and emotions.  I STRONGLY recommend this album!
B00275EGWY|1.0|This is a long, dull movie with just a hint of action and suspense. The cover and promos would lead you to believe that this film is full of action, but don't be fooled. It's slow, weak, and tiresome.
B002POVIMS|4.0|I had a $5 Amazon MP3 credit and bought this after hearing a few samples.  This is one of the few albums where I don't skip over a majority of them.  There standouts are I'm Not Your Toy, Bulletproof, and In For the Kill, but the rest are worth listening to over and over.  The only ones I don't really care for are Reflections Are Protection, Colourless Colour, and Cover My Eyes.  I heard the Bayonetta ad remix of In For the Kill, but honestly it's too slow-paced compared to the original.  I love her \\"shrilly\\" voice (as another reviewer put it) - it's like electricity going through you.      The beats can meld together and get repetitive after some time, so I wouldn't recommend listening to them all the way through too much, just at random.  It would be nice to have some more lyrical variety, like from Lady Gaga, who has shown that you can inject more than four lines of lyrics into songs.  As for her image, it's nice to see a non-blonde who doesn't try to shock listeners with cursing, edgy behavior, and near-nudity.    I can't wait to hear more from this duo.
B003E48AYC|2.0|You have to hand to Disney; they really are treating this Blu-ray release like a million bucks. I actually got excited for this release again, that is until I remembered I didn't really like the movie. I thought it was an ugly, blurry mess because of the 3D but after watching the Blu-ray last night, no, it's just an ugly drab mess - period.  I don't understand how Tim Burton got the cinematography so wrong on this. I said in my original review that Tim Burton was born to make this movie - 10 films ago, now it just feels like I've seen it all a million times before with more passion from the director.    Picture/Presentation    I really expected to love the Blu-ray experience, I mean I officially hate most 3D films so I thought watching this in the crispness of HD would enhance the experience and it doesn't. It's one of the worst looking films I've ever seen on ye old Blu-ray.  The transfer is fine, but I don't think there's any amount of sharpness you can add that makes up for the dreariness of the production quality.  Audio sounds great, but a boring soundtrack doesn't help matters.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and French. This comes in Disney's standard 3 Disc packaging (Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy) with a slip case. I like the cover art, but there's nothing that stands out.  Menu navigation is easy, clean and straightforward to use.    Extras    Disney does add one unique unadvertised extra and that's something called a Descriptive Audio Track. It's very cool; it's some woman that's describing everything that's happening on the screen. It's as though you are listening to an audio book. I hope all future Disney productions include this; it adds a whole new dimension to the viewing experience.      Other than this new feature, the rest of the extras are an extensive set of featurettes that show you how the production was put together and cast interviews. Warner has Maximum Movie Mode and Universal has U-Control, Fox we just won't mention them - we're lucky if they give us one 4 minute featurette, Disney really needs to come up with their version of Picture N. Picture. They generally do everything else right, but skimp on this one feature.    Comments    I wish I could rave about this disc, I always love and appreciate a great PR Campaign, and Disney Home Video rarely disappoints but this package sucks, not because of anything on this set, but because the movie is barely watchable (I turned it off 20 minutes into it) and no amount of shine is going to fix this simple fact. Wonderland should be this amazing, vibrant looking place - even if it's under control of evil, there should be a sense of awe to the visuals instead everything just lays there looking dead and fake. There's no life to anything on screen - even the actors. You should skip this movie altogether, it's not worthy of a rental that alone a purchase.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I received the movie Avatar very quickly after ordering it and at a fair and equitable price. I was pleased with this transaction.
B0035WTJFW|4.0|Good quality movie, however I forgot how old this one actually is (2002).  So the Blu-Ray quality is not as good as most newer movies.  This was still a good deal for a good movie.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|The new version of Robin Hood (2010) was great, so are the many other versions out there but this is probably the best one. Errol Flynn really captures the spirit of the caharacter and Prince John soon to be King John is a villianous as can be imagined.The real king John was no coward but he was not a nice person by any standards and this version of Robin Hood is probably the most loved one.  Thankfully they shot the movie in color and so on blu ray it just comes alive like I have never seen it do before. This classic movie  has a allstar cast that stands the test of time too. But if you want this movie you need to own it on blu ray.  Few movies have no one star reviews , This one's lowest rating is a four star!  And every review is correct. This one will enthrall any viewer and it's so good that they don't need computer graphics to be as good as something made today.
030726999X|4.0|I finally finished this book last night!<br /><br />I thought that the book was quite interesting, it was a good conclusion to the trilogy (though through the writing I get an impression that it was not to be the last, but alas Larsson is no longer alive to continue writing of Blomkist and Salander). I've found, after reading \\"The Dragon Tattoo\\" and \\"The Hornet's Nest\\" that Larsson had a way of building up the story line until the epic like events which take place in the latter part of the book and the same is here in \\"The Hornets Nest\\". I loved the action in the end (as in all of the novels in the trilogy). Larsson never failed to create a strong and thriving female figure.<br /> Sometimes I found that the space between the beginning and the end of the novel become rather redundant. And at points I had hoped that something very unexpected would take place that would further challenge my view of the book as a whole. But there were points where I was surprised and that is, I suppose, a good thing. My only other complaint is that I found that the journalist's sexual endeavors tended to be over-killed (I can only take SO many women wanting to jump into bed with this man before closing the book entirely or wondering if the author was trying to live out some fantasy of his own)<br /><br />Overall I would rate it good; I thought \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" is probably the best of the three books.
B003102JDM|5.0|For a great film, I wonder what significance there is to the fact that the movie is set near the end of May 1967 (Calendar on a wall with May and June showing, \\"Somebody to love\\" on a transistor radio, School still on in Springtime, Tornado Season), But the Columbia record club Phone call had the featured album for April was Santana's Abraxas and For May was Creedence Clearwater Revival's Cosmos Factory. Both records not released until 1970!   Love the Columbia record club, the selections come and you don't have to do anything, But Pay up.    Also it was a transistor radio that was confiscated, So how did the Rabbi(Was he Dumbledore's lost brother?) pick up on the song \\"Somebody To Love\\" so astutely? I don't mind  as the song was used so effectively in this movie.

Samantha was over the top and showed little class....basically she was disrespectful in a country where a little class would have gone a long way...it was distasteful....she just looked like a woman who cannot accept the fact she is getting older. She just looked like an old fool....you can be classy, sexy and mature.....but this was not the case for her character!  Carrie, whose character I normally love came off as a nag who is never satisfied.  Charlotte was just annoying!! Awww poor you.... you have to care for two children....maybe if she spent more time with them they would not have been screaming for her attention, and who makes cupcakes dressed to the nines and in white at that????

B000PAAJYW|2.0|The movie was a bit too confusing and lame for me to enjoy.  Yes, I can see how some people like it.  It seems like people either love this movie or hate it.  It's sort of like Mulan Rouge - a kaleidescope of confusion.  For me, I like something that is a bit more grounded.  It's definitely original, but expression without a thought or care of what the audience might like is like throwing darts.  You can hit your target or miss the mark.
0783225482|1.0|I have to admit that I goofed when I purchased this DVD.  I NEVER buy panned and scanned movies and haven't for many years.  If I had paid attention, I would have realized that this is not the full widescreen movie that I expected and I would never have purchased it.<br /><br />Having said that, I also have to say that I LOVE this movie.  It has a very funny story line with excellent makeup and special effects.  Goldie Hawn, Meryl Streep and Bruce Willis are excellent in their roles.  I would love to have the actual (as opposed to the chopped off panned and scanned version) in my video library.<br /><br />The picture quality of this DVD is terrible.  You might as well have it on VHS tape or just watch the cable listings to catch it some time.<br /><br />If you love this movie, as I do, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD.

B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I know many people will disagree with this review because I already saw the multitude of positive responses about this movie, but this is not Austen. There may be nothing wrong with the acting, but the story is too frothy and thin to do justice to the real wit and complexity of Jane Austen's novel. The main actors, especially Elizabeth and her family are two-dimensional pop versions of the novel. The family has been turned into \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" characters without richness or intricacy. In the novel (and in the A & E mini-series), the father was a man who hid from his duties and obligations to his family because he was bitterly disappointed in his choice of wife. Dazzled by her beauty and societal airs, he realised after their marriage that she was childish, superficial and self-absorbed. Although he is learned, perceptive and capable and despite the fact that he cares for his two eldest daughters, he fails to do what is right by his family; he refuses to establish rules of conduct or attempt to mould his daughters into moral adults with compassion and integrity and despite her affection for her father, is a constant source of embarrassment for Elizabeth. It is Elizabeth's shame about her parents that creates her defensive 'pride' which clashes with Darcy's proud demeanour. It is really Darcy's stiffness and lack of easy social skills that masquerades as pride just as Elizabeth's attitude is also a cover. Both of their external facades create prejudice against perceived slights and causes the delightful sparks between the two. The father and mother in this movie are all sweetness and light. if you enjoy slight romantic comedy than I guess you might like this movie, but if you want breadth and scope of character, a revealing insight into the society and mores of 18th century Britain and a damn good read, then I suggest you start with the novel itself. If you prefer a visual version, then I would recommend the A & E  series as it is the most faithful to the original with only minor deviations. Both are extremely delightful and there is no substitute for Austen's sparkling wit.e original with only minor deviations. Both are extremely delightful and there is no substitute for Austen's sparkling wit.
0810983915|4.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid      This is the BEST book in the series! The title of this book is Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days by Jeff Kinney. The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series are comedies.  The main character in this book is Greg Heffley. Other important characters are Rowley Jefferson, Rodrick Heffley, Mr. Jefferson, Greg's Dad, Greg's Mom, and Manny.   The book starts when Greg and Rowley go to Mr. Jefferson's (Rowley's Dad) Country club. Greg gets kicked out because he complains about every little detail. Usually, every summer Greg and his family go to the beach but this summer they lack the money needed and cannot afford it. Unfortunately, instead of the beach, Greg has to go to the town pool which he hates because of the hairy men in the showers. Mr. Jefferson is very frustrated towards Rowley and Greg because they spent $83 at the Country Club. He said that they will have to pay his bill. They start a gardening company to gain money but it doesn't work.    I loved this book. When I started reading it I couldn't put it down, it was so entertaining! The author makes the book very funny at the right moments. This was by far the best Diary of a Wimpy Kid book I have ever read. All of you should read it!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Let me first start off by saying that I don't usually create reviews, and my normal fare isn't a book on slavery/the south, but this story was a true gem. The words and visuals transport you! You feel such sadness, grief, joy in light of adversity, that it took just four short days to finish. Just wonderful. I highly reccomend!
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I have to give this only 5 stars, but I would love to see Sir Paul play 3 of my faves in concert: 'Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey', 'Listen What the Man Said', 'Do You Want to Know a Secret?'. Ok, I know that is a bias review and that every artist is not a mind-reader to know what fans like, but still, I'd pay to see those tunes performed live!  On this 33 song set, what can I say? Simply fantastic. The sound, the images, the unforgettable funny and charming Sir Paul! Oh, and Billy Joel as a guest? Simply a great gesture of Paul's part. Go and get this one.. it's a keeper!
030745455X|5.0|Gripping from beginning to end.  Less gory than book #1.  As usual, Mr. Larsson keeps you in suspense as to the real murderers throughout the book.  Can't wait to read the third part of the Millennium Trilogy.
B00275EHIM|5.0|I have no experience with the video game The Prince of Persia but having seen the trailers for the film, week after week, I was interested in seeing the film.  I like tales set in mythic times so The Prince of Persia had an appeal, which was completely fulfilled by the film.    I have revealed some of the story, below, so those who have not seen the movie might want to skip the next two paragraphs.     The story centers on Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal), a boy of the streets, who is adopted by the king of Persia for his bravery and coming to assist those in need.  The king already has two sons, Tus and Garsiv, and his adoption of Dastan comes from a prophecy.  Dastan grows up to be a clever warrior and a voice of reason for his older brothers.  The story revolves around that taking of the Holy City of Alamut.  Dastan is against storming the city until evidence is presented that the inhabitants are forging weapons that will be used against the Persians by other enemies.  Ben Kingsley plays the king's brother who presents a mask of the perfect advisor to his nephews.  The city is captured and Dastan comes into possession of the true reason the city was captured: a dagger that hold inside it magical sand that can reverse time.  The dagger is guarded by a princess named Tamina (played by Gemma Arterton) who contrives to steal the dagger.     The king of Persia arrives at the Alamut, and is poisoned from a gift given to him by Dastan.  Dastan must flee and prove his innocence.  Along the way, is a humorous encounter with an ostrich racing, tax-evading sheik played by Alfred Molina.  Dastan and the princess trade the dagger back and forth, and are pursued by sinister assassins.            I was unsure if Jake Gyllenhaal would make an effective action-romantic hero, but he does a magnificent job with the role. He has good on screen chemistry with Gemma Arterton. The production is sumptuous and the costume designers produced some stunning costumes. Several reviewers have said thedialogue was tiresome and the editing choppy but I did not find that to be the case. The Prince of Persian is a fantastic adventure in the tradition of the tales of the Arabian Nights.  When the film was over, I would have happily seen it again.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Avatar is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  And in blu-ray, it was great!
B000BSLU2S|5.0|Long story short, I removed the old compound and used the Arctic Silver 5 and it works like a charm. I never had a slowdown when I play games on my laptop, and it always tends to heat up. I highly recommend it to people who need to replace their old compound with this.
B000ETQR3Q|5.0|I have the yellow nerf longshot and without the barrel it is the PERFECT gun for a war because the kid now has an assault rifle (no barrel), a long rifle (recon barrel), and a sniper rifle (with regular barrel). I love this gun because it has high durability, good and accurate gun, and is the main rifle for good reasons.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I'm not going to bore you with nonsense about old Metallica vs. new; Metallica have been evolving and improving, at least until St Anger.  \\"I celebrate their entire catalog.\\"  Death Magnetic is perhaps their finest record; tapping writing styles from every Metallica period, told through an updated old school approach.<br /><br />I bought Death Magnetic as an Amazon MP3 download.  It was really loud and noticeably lacking bass guitar.  I was so impressed with the actual music, that I added the CD to my next regular Amazon shipment - including Metallica's disappointing monophonic DVD Orgullo, Pasion, Y Gloria (see my review).<br /><br />Lo and behold, the MP3 transfer I made from this CD sounds a lot better than the Amazon download, even though their file size was almost double mine.  I use the highest rip - and they both register the same sample rates, so I'm a little confused on how this can be -- but its true.<br /><br />I would speculate that problems with the original CD pressing have been quietly corrected - but I don't have an older version to compare.  All I can tell you is I can hear Trujillo's bass pretty clearly on the CD I just got from Amazon.
B0015XASFS|5.0|Josh in person is quite different from his studio CD's.  On the one hand, his singing is somewhat less technically perfect and there are times when he goes nasal.  On the other hand, he is high energy and has great stage presence, so one gains something from seeing him live.  He has a beautiful voice, but his zest for communing with and touching his fans is even more beautiful.  Josh is almost religiously casual, with five o'clock shadow, shirt untucked, and awkwardness in attempting to dance -- accompanied by barefoot string soloists.  He has an uncanny ability to project a boy-next-door persona, rather than celebrity.<br /><br />The other performers are fabulous.<br /><br />On this DVD, Lucia Micarelli plays two amazing solos.  One, \\"Kashmir,\\" a cover for a Led Zeppelin rock piece, is quite probably the most extraordinary violin performance ever recorded -- a performance in which music is changed, irrevocably, where the very nature of the instrument is transformed.  If you have not seen this performance, you simply must.  There is no other possible course of action.<br /><br />The evolution of the DVD is starting from Josh's prior pop/classical crossover stuff, but going more toward a folk/rock/jazz type direction at the end.  Josh's drum solo is not at all classical sounding.<br /><br />Josh is clearly a person who loves all music and cultures and ultimately will likely visit all genres -- and bring back music to us from many more countries as he does from Ireland, Italy, and Africa here.  Those of us addicted to his beautiful voice will be compelled to follow where he leads us, hoping his musical judgment remains as excellent as it has been so far.
B000V5TV22|5.0|Works great, Plugged it in, loaded the software onto my laptop, and was working in seconds. I'm replacing the GPS unit that came with Streets&Trips. This unit works so much faster than the Microsoft one ever did. It locks on satellites in 1-2 seconds as oppose to 30 seconds to 10 minutes with my other one.
0141315180|3.0|It was in decent shape, and not bad for the price.  However, it did smell a little musty and old.  I wish that hadn't been the case.  I do not like to read books when they are like that...discourages me from reading it.  But, I needed it for a last minute graduate school assignment and I really didn't have much choice, as there were not many other cheap options in close vicinity to my state.
B002SJIO4A|4.0|This is a decent movie. It is not too bad in that the story is compelling and it is shot in a decent manner, but this movie is somewhat poor in its timing and special effects. It just gets a slow at times and the special affects are somewhat corny. I mean the story just needed a little more editing to make the thing so good you could not turn away. However, as the movie was offered as a final product it is very slow at points. The acting was very good, and the movie made a point. It just was a little slow. Worth a watch, but not buying.
0316017922|5.0|Gladwell makes some interesting links. Like why so many great hockey players are born in Jan., Feb., March. And the Chinese are so good at math because they grow rice. Definitely worth the read.
B002ZG99D6|5.0|I had seen the movie in the theater shortly after it came out and really enjoyed it. I'm a big Nicholas Sparks fan and I try to see all the movies made from his books. I really don't understand why everybody is bashing this film because of Miley Cyrus cause she wasn't that bad. Her acting really surprised me. It's about time she moves on from Hannah Montana. I already preordered the DVD because it is the type movie that I will want to watch over and over again. I especially liked the chemistry between Miley Cyrus and Liam Harmsworth. I thought it was very romantic and sexy and Liam is quite a hunk. If you have not read the book, I recommend reading the book first before seeing the movie. I think the story/movie will make more sense and be more interesting.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|I bought this DVD as a replacement to the first one that had not been returned to me after letting some one borrow it.  I had purchased the first one several years ago.  I love the goofy humor of the movie, but when I played the first DVD, there were issues with the movie freezing momentarily, or stopping altogether.  I was not sure if it was the DVD player or the copy.  However, when I played my new copy, on a different DVD player, the same thing happened.  I don't know if it's a distributor/manufacturer issue, operator issue, or just bad luck.  Regardless, I still love the movie itself.
B001DCQIAA|5.0|The recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic were done in 1971 when they were both at peak performance.  Listen to the recording of the 4th--very powerful. The adagio in the 2nd symphony is movingly played, yet under a tight rhythic control.  The third disc contains the Schumann overture and the 4th symphony played by the Vienna Philharmonic--also a fine performance.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Okay, so I'm just now getting into Iron Maiden and this is my first Iron Maiden album that I own and I've got to say that I really like it. It's fantastic, actually. Back in the Eighties I knew folks who would tell me how good Iron Maiden were, but back then I just didn't have the money or time to buy everything that anyone told me was worth buying. I had to be selective with my limited budget and so I never really got into Iron Maiden. Plus, I just do not recall them getting any airplay or much videos on MTV at the time that caught my attention, except for maybe Run to the Hills, which did receive some play on MTV, but to be honest it never really grabbed me.<br /><br />Nowadays people can go to places like You Tube and hear practically anything done by any artist, and so it is that I listened to a lot of Iron Maiden stuff to see what I've been missing, and I'm glad that I did. Songs like The Trooper really got my attention, it's a great song. But when I heard songs like Dream of Mirrors, and The Mercenary, and The Wicker Man, which are all featured on Brave New World, I just couldn't get them out of my head. I had to own them.<br /><br />This album is loaded with so much great emotion, lyrics, melody, riffs, and beats, it just really grabs your ears and heart and doesn't let go through to the very end. It's baffling to read how many of the critics out there will say that Iron Maiden's earlier stuff is better than this? If that is true, I can't wait to hear it. But, and this may be a bit presumptious of me, although I have listened to some of their earlier material online, and a lot of it sounds pretty damned good, but the songs on this album just seem to be so much more epic and powerful sounding than a lot of what I have heard so far. Either way, I still plan to get the rest of their albums over time, at least the ones featuring Bruce Dickinson because I really love the sound of his voice.<br /><br />Standout Tracks are: All of them!
0380730405|5.0|You can't say enough about this product. I am astounded by the intricate plot that carries you through it. I recently discovered this classic and I am enthralled with it. The tension between the characters draws you into the story regardless. I honestly did not see any particular reason for it to be classified as a \\"romance\\" in any way as it merely shows the dynamic between a married couple, as could be featured in any novel. I know the novel is, however, classified as a \\"romantic suspense.\\" I adored the atmospheres used. The old part of Manderlay was dark and frightening, it completely paralleled with the sentiments the main character held about Maxim's old life. While the new part of the home, where they lived, was bright and new.<br /><br />We are never prepared to see how Rebecca was, in reality. The author implies a great deal of her from other character's perspectives and actions that turn out to be completely false. It is one of the finest suspense novels I've ever had the privilege of reading.
B002VECM6S|4.0|This is the true story of Michael Oher, an offensive line back for the Baltimore Ravens and a very well depicted one at that. This movie also won an Oscar and 4 more awards this year, being nominated for 12 more. Adapted from Michael Lewis's The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game from 2006, Michael \\"Big Mike\\" Oher is a neglected, homeless African American teenager who struggles to find a warm place to stay every night. He meets the Tuohy's, a rich white family, who takes him in after seeing that he is homeless with no spare clothes or food. This movie follows Michael's life mainly after he meets the Tuohy's and his struggle attending Briarcrest Christian School with his 0.9 GPA and learning to play football. Throughout the story everything gradually becomes better: his living situation, his grades, his football performance and his life in general.  Newcomer Quinton Aaron, playing Michael Oher fit the role physically but also does a fantastic job portraying Oher as a quiet, vulnerable yet surprisingly emotionally strong character who could have easily been portrayed as either dull or retarded, due to Michael's lack of education. His character was the total opposite of Leigh-Anne Touhy's, played by Sandra Bullock who won an Oscar for her outstanding performance with her credible southern drawl, strength, brazen outlook, and sharp sass. Her role in this movie was very different from her usual roles in comedies such as Miss Congeniality and The Proposal, yet she fit it perfectly and I could not imagine anyone playing the role better. Tim McGraw played Sean Tuohy, Leigh-Anne's supportive husband who tolerated and never objected whatever Leigh-Anne did whether it was deciding to take Michael in or adopt him. S.J. is played by Jae Head who in reality is not the pipsqueak that the movie makes him out to be, however it worked in the movie because it plays up S.J.'s childlike innocence and genuine liking of Michael and his determination to help Oher become a better football player, only taking the best for his best friend and brother.  Director John Lee Hancock does a great job directing the movie. The movie was filmed in Atlanta although the story takes place in Memphis, Tennessee. However this does not affect the movie that much as it pretty much still captured the same southern feel. The camera usage and technology was great and was very smooth and easy to watch. The soundtrack of the movie was an interesting arrangement ranging from MC's rapping to the old school jazz of the Dave Brubeck Quartet. The music fit with the sequence of events and many of them were perfect fits to the scene and the themes of the movie. For example during the beginning credits the song Chances by Five for Fighting plays. The lyrics are very appropriate to what this movie is all about opportunities, and taking chances. \\"Chances are when said and done. Who'll be the lucky ones? Who make it all the way?\\"  A thought provoking and emotionally tearing part in the movie is when Michael Oher has to choose between his mother- who despite being a drug addict is still nevertheless his mother- and the Tuohy's who gave him the opportunity to succeed along with a loving stable family. Although The Blind Side follows a cliché movie format in that it is about an young African American who, when given the chance makes it big in the sports world yet at the same time it is different from all of the others. There is no horribly cliché reunion between Michael and his drug addicted mother, no overdone family bonding, it is very simply, very real. However there are some dramatized parts -therefore making The Blind Side a docudrama-  like Michael's smooth integration with the Tuohy's and his GPA rising from a 0.9 to a 2.54 in a short span of time albeit through effort and hard work, is very Hollywood. On the other hand Michael's flashbacks which we see occasionally show his rough childhood, the scene where the Sean Tuohy first lays eyes on Michael picking up buckets of popcorn after a basketball game, the gangs in the rough neighborhood where he comes from all contribute to The Blind Side being a much grounded movie.   The movie only subtly faces the role of race such as at the first football game when a group of rednecks make racist comments at \\"Big Mike\\" or when the Tuohy's and Michael go to an upscale restaurant and Michael bumps into his brother who happens to work as a waiter there, they are like splashes of reality throughout a almost fairytale like story. The movie over all is very inspiring and the diverse array of emotions felt by the audience feels is great. There are moments when you are angry at the injustice, saddened by the hopelessness, prideful in his victory, joyful at his happy ending. Compared to other docudramas of the past, all of the facts in this movie are correct except for how the immediate actions took by the Touhy's afterward. In reality, Sean went back to Briarcrest the day after to set up a lunch account for Michael to make sure he had something to eat after seeing him picking up buckets of popcorn after a basketball game. Also, Leigh-Anne did encounter Michael at the side of the road, however she did not offer him a place to stay directly but took him shopping. It is either the small details or the sequence of events that are different and since the message of the whole movie is not changed by those small insignificant details it is not a big deal.   This movie can be enjoyed by everyone not only because it is so inspiring and touching, but because in the final events of the movie, you realize that this story is not really about the role of race or social classes and different cultures even within America, but that it is one human reaching out to help another human being in need. It is about kindness, love and family.
B0039ZF89G|3.0|Having been a Stones fan most of my life and owning every album I just can't justify buying this. The last time I upgraded \\"Exile\\" was when the 94 Virgin remaster came out and I'm very happy with it. I bought the first release with the mini postcards and replica album cover of all eight albums that were produced at that time and the sound is as close as I think we're going to get to the album's sound. I did want the new tracks from the new Exile and thankfully Target has an exclusive 10 track CD including all the extra tracks included here.<br /><br />Unless you really want to shell out this kind of money for this so-so release, go to Target pay $9.99 for the extras CD release and buy the upcoming Stones in Exile and The Mick Taylor years DVD's being released soon, you'll save well over a hundred bucks and will probably have more material(at least more interesting)than what you get here on the \\"deluxe\\" edition. I love the Stones, but really \\"do it right or don't do it at all.\\" They didn't even include the alternate version of 'All Down The Line' on this!, which is on an Japanese import version?? So you don't even get it all on this deluxe edition. 5 stars for the classic album and 2 deducted for not giving a complete song set and overpricing.
B00009UTQD|4.0|Tamrac makes good products and this is no exception.  Well-padded and roomy, stores more filters than most digital photogs need.  I would have given 5 stars if the case did a better job of sealing out dust, dirt, moisture, etc.  The fold over flap doesn't do the job adequately.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|I loved the movie when I saw it in the theaters. So glad I bought this deluxe edition. Gave great insight into the development of the film and the journey the story took from cult classic, to broadway, back to the Big Screen. There are some features I have yet to discover on the discs, but am thoroughly enjoying the ride! Many extras and bonus features across both discs make this SO worth the price!
B002VECM6S|5.0|Product was shipped very quickly.  Really appreciated that.  Price and shipping fees were fine.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|I have been avoiding this film for some time now because it just didn't sound interesting to me. I like Winslet and Fiennes  a whole lot so they were what drew me to  give it a shot. I haven't been this surprised in a long time and this is the third film this week I rated 5 stars, so I'm on a roll with some really good films!<br /><br />This is a sad story but it isn't the usual clich&eacute;d mess we are all used to. Much of the credit comes from the three main actors Winslet, Kross and Fiennes. This film will stay with you after the credits roll and if I had one problem with this film it was that to me it was very obvious that this woman couldn't read all along, but when Fiennes realizes this, he seemed completely shocked!? It just seemed a little silly that the big pay off was known way too early. Regardless of this very minor flaw, this is a really good one, so don't judge a book by it's cover.....be the reader! ;-b
0807014273|5.0|The author Viktor Frankl really was amazing in details of what life is all about withing the walls of concentration camps. The horror that the people and also Viktor Frankl lived through and were able to write about is a wonder of wonders.
B000XA5K48|5.0|The villain is smart and witty. It is such a rarity to have an intelligent villain that that fact alone makes this movie an amazing action movie. Clive Owen is an awesome BAMF.  The plot holes are minimum, the dialogue is witty, and the action is full of it. What more could you ask for in a shoot 'em up movie? There is even a sex scene to boot.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I caught this film on an HD channel a while back and it has been on my DVR for months. I can't say that I remembered much if any of this film, so I'm pretty sure I never sat down to watch this film before now. Like a lot of John Ford films no one seems to capture Americana better and 'The Grapes of Wrath' is certainly one of his best film. The film follows a family during the great depression, from losing their land to going across country to California to try to cut out a sustaining life for themselves.<br /><br />The film seems dated in a good way now because so many of these values and this type of determination are rarely seen now a days. Henry Fonda and John Carradine are so young they looked like they are fresh out of the turnip patch! I had heard of this film and the book for years(I probably read the book in school?)and now I can finally say that I have seen this classic film.....a great film by any standards with an inspiring story and some wonderful performances from a time long gone.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The price of the product was in my range, even with shipping costs it was less expensive than buying it at a store. It was delivered in the time that was stated, and in perfect condition. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
B003CRXKJG|3.0|None of the extras were put on this DVD as on the Spanish verison.  Nor does it contain the alternate ending.  Other than not being distracted by the Spanish translation at the bottom there was no good reason to purchase the this long awaited copy since I already have the VHS, which is the same.     Couldn't give a 5 star only because of what the DVD lacks..... movie is Great.... love it.
B002JMLMKE|5.0|Well researched information about a man who is probably one of the most amazing geniuses of all time, DaVinci, woven into a fictional story of intrigue. As his main character Brown paints a picture of a logical, mentally absorbed professor who delights in expounding on his personal encyclopedia of information about the world of ancient symbols and their deeper meaning.<br />As he challenges the power of the church of Rome, he is met with life threatening opposition. Quite believable and an enjoyable read.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|All these one star reviews are right!  I was a huge fan of Planet Earth, and watched both versions BBC (David Attenborough) and Discovery (Sigourney Weaver).  IMO Sigourney did an excellent job.  I was so excited for the Life series, I was unaware it was narrated by Oprah until I watched it on TV.  Although I am not a fan of Oprah, I feel I didn't hate the series simply because it was Oprah narrating it, I hated it because she does a lousy job.  This really isn't for her.  I was so disappointed watching this on TV.  I really did give it a chance, but eventually was forced to press the mute button.  I guarantee that the 5 star reviews are Oprah drones, there is no way you can like her narration with out being a complete Oprah slave.  Please get the BBC version it is 5 stars all the way!!!
0446615625|3.0|A fast moving mystery that leaves the reader questioning the creditability of every government organization. The in depth descriptions of some of these three lettered named government groups does not deter from the overall plot, but actually adds to the flow. The characters come alive with the author's colorful descriptions.<br />Baldacci paints a beautiful portrayal of how power can be intoxicatingly corrupt. An entertaining and thought provoking read with just the right amount of twists and turns to keep you turning the page.
1423113381|4.0|The Red Pyramid is an excellent addition to Riordan's young adult mythology niche.  If you've read the Percy Jackson series, then the book may seem a bit formulaic, but there are enough differences to keep it interesting.  I love how Riordan is helping to get young readers engaged in classic myths - I only wish I thought of it first!
0385474547|5.0|Used book was in perfect condition and arrived prior to promise date.  I could not have had better product or service!

B001PPLIEG|5.0|I think I enjoyed this more than any other Bond film in recent history. It's the usual fair--explosions, fights and the mystery--but the production was stupendous. It's one of those rare films that you watch and two and a half hours later, you realize it's over. If you love Bond, get this film. It's good.
B000MLCCT4|5.0|This is my first Tom petty album and I love it. Every song is an instant classic. GOOD OL' REAL ROCK \\"N\\" ROLL. A must-have record.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Seriously good movie. I didn't think I would like it as much as I did. I thought James Cameron did a fantastic jobn with this and the F/X's were awesome. Great film. I also watched and liked [[ASIN:B001PPLIEG Quantum of Solace]].
0316044938|5.0|This book is beautifully written, in a riveting couldn't-put-it-down fashion but heartbreaking and disturbing at the same time.  Absolutely brilliant.  I read it years ago when it was number one on the best sellers' list and am reading it once again. It still blows me away.  HIGHLY recommended but not for the faint of heart.
0321356683|3.0|Relatively strong in the language of java, it is a craft knowledge book. One will generally find most of the recommendations correct. I like this book, but find the book fails in the meta process area.     It fails in three areas.   The first is the key weakness...   1)    It is too weak on the process of confirming the correctness of java. Snippets of craft knowledge applied to the APIs, is not as necessary as the process of confirming the java code performs as expected. It gives craft knowledge, but not the knowledge to develop one's own craft.     - The most important thing a book like this can do is to teach a developer how to think about effective java programming. Metaprocess not just examples.   - How to profile correctly and tie these to the results of at least one example would be excellent. Many programmers reading the book, don't know how to confirm the effectiveness of their own code. Explaining in detail how to confirm the examples with the profiler would make this a five ***** item.    - It doesn't cover how to use static analysis tools and how to customize them for yourself or your shop. For example, avoiding finalize to release resources can be detected by a custom checker as a shop standard. Many static analysis tools can automatically (or can be made to) check code patterns.      Basically, a \\"my approach to effective java\\" chapter would help of how the author comes to this knowledge and confirms it.     These next two are nit's on the book's topic...     2) Java in it's environment could be better explained and the properties that affect the execution. It doesn't clearly explain how some SUN API's are very property setting dependent. Understanding the intentionality of an API property and finding the correct value for properties is essential. General practices require deeper knowledge of the API's (e.g. such as SUN's RMIs large number of unofficially documented garbage collection settings see [...] ). There are limits of java portability and someedgy API's get programmers into trouble. Knowing what and how to tradeoff architectural decisions in selecting an API or language construct is useful.     Further some of these recommendations are affected by the gc and heap settings. Some types of JVMs (SUN's 1.4 had IMP) have differences that change the recommended practice.       3) Use of certain packages over others (e.g. nio (Java 7 nio2)) and what the purpose of these packages are could be explained better. How performance and file transfers are improved with non-blocking io.     Finally, I note java always consists at least these two tasks developing correctly and searching for the correct API to use. Those following this book may believe that the coding correctly is sufficient.     Afterword. I do like this book, but it doesn't make me think using this (JB) author's mental process. Improve by explaining the process of discovering effective java and incorporating it in practice, and this book becomes essential. It's a choice of giving programming pearls versus teaching one how to find programming pearls of wisdom. (I like both, but a bit more of the latter.)     Effective practice performs at least the following functions:    - Defect Tracking - identify critical failures affecting system performance (bugzilla)   - Profiling - determine resource usage and performance of running software components over time (dynamic analysis) and ensure memory leaks aren't occurring   - Network Analysis - (for programs with networking) determine network component and communication failures and packet timing (e.g. wireshark)   - Logging - monitor the logged events in the system for trends and failures (log4j)  - Debugging - trace the execution of code in development to ascertain correct behavior (eclipse)  - Instrumentation - monitor (in a limited fashion) the software and hardware components in production (e.g. SNMP in the Java 6 JVM)   - Static Analysis - analyze (automated or walkthrough) the code for defects prior to running (e.g. Findbugs, checkstyle or better PMD)   - Compilation - analyze the compiler output (WERROR)   - Database Statistics - analyze the database (or file) statistics and access path to stored data (e.g. explain plan, top 10 lists)   - Code management (e.g. subversion or better mylin)     Thanks     Joe
B003EYVXYG|4.0|I've learned from the past not to be too quick to judge a Romero zombie flick.  I was pretty unimpressed with my initial viewing of Diary of the Dead.  But after another look I realized just how great that film really is.  So I watched SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD a couple of times before attempting a review, and it actually did get a little better with repeated viewings.  But still, overall this probably is a slight step back for the zombie master.<br /><br />It does have decent doses of your expected flesh-chomping madness.  I wonder if Romero uses some bad CGI just to illustrate how inferior it is to old school bloody effects with makeup and props.  Still he includes some solid gory moments as well.  One scene that puzzled me was when some hunters beheaded some zombies and but their heads on wooden stakes.  Dead heads on a stick.  These zombies kept moaning despite the fact their brains were removed from the spinal cord.  This scene looked pretty cool, and illustrated the foolishness of the men.  But it seems to contradict the very zombie rules that Romero helped establish.  I was under the impression that headshots or beheadings are supposed to incapacitate the undead, release their souls from their decaying corpses.  Oh well.<br /><br />The most notable point this movie makes is about the violent, idiotic nature of man.  Even in the most desperate, grim situation humanity refuses to unite and work together.  Really, people aren't much smarter than the freakin zombies.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the conflict of disposing of the walking dead.  Killing an infected loved one would be quite a troublesome circumstance.  One man takes it upon himself to rid the world of these soulless creatures.  Another man sees the zombs as merely having a sickness, and possibly curable.  Their obstinate ways proves to be their downfall.  Brilliant message.<br /><br />Overall, SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD is a worthy addition to your zombie collection, or to complete your Romero Dead films.  I was pleased it kept the comedy and romance to a minimum.  Nowhere near Romero's best by any means, but I'll rewatch this again before another viewing of Zombieland.  That's just me though.mance to a minimum.  Nowhere near Romero's best by any means, but I'll rewatch this again before another viewing of Zombieland.  That's just me though.
B003EYVXYQ|5.0|The shotgun blast of reviews for this film are baffling to me. But then again, it is important to remember that Diary of the Dead was initially trashed, Land of the Dead was moderately reviewed at best and Day of the Dead was initially hated (and is now considered a fan favorite).    With that said, here is my take on it, for what it is worth...    This movie does differ in tone than many of Romero's other films. Certainly not as heavy or serious as Diary of the Dead intended to be or Land of the Dead mostly was. When a National Guard Soldier blows the head off of a zombie (in, albeit, a pretty cheesy CGI effect) in the first few moments of the film, my brain did not go into \\"This movie sucks\\" mode as so many others seemed to. My brain went into, \\"Ah! Just like Dawn of the Dead! This movie is a romp!\\" Like most competent Directors (and I consider Romero VERY competent as a film director, not to mention Indie film hero), Romero shows us what HE wants us to see and he always has a reason for doing it. That head-blowing-off scene was there for a reason. Several people, I feel, just didn't understand the reason.    I personally feel, many fans of any artist (regardless of medium) begin to form a very rigid idea of what that artist's work is, especially when they come to most of that artist's work after it had been completed (or are young fans as I was). And when said artist creates something new, sometimes fans struggle with the interpretation.    What is unique about this film despite its lighter overall tone(and I feel most critiques missed) is that here we have multi-layered social commentary with a subtle complexity not normally seen even in most Romero movies. The initial question: Should we keep our loved-ones \\"alive\\" as-it-were as zombies, hoping for a cure? Eventually devolves into the nature of humanity and its ability to hold grudges far past rationality, common-sense and sanity. Even one of the last lines in the film and the decisions Sarge makes defy reasonbut are sadly believable from the frame-work of the human mind. The social commentary Romero is known for is here and more complex than ever!    The more I think and reflect on this film the more I realize this is one of Romero's very best in what he has to say about humanity and it is VERY relevant to the times. This film, despite its lighter tone, is a tragedy of the human spirit. It is full of potentially good people making bad decisions, even in the final frames, albeit in a fun and entertaining way. Much like our modern world, in that as we are faced with serious issues and many more serious ones on the horizon, we choose look away, not taking it as seriously as we should and continue to make the wrong choices because we are too rooted in our past. So are the characters in this film.    One final note: If you are a Romero fan, to heck with bad reviews!!! At the very least you owe Romero one viewing of this film, love it or not. This artist created an entire sub-genre of horror and he continues to make films outside of the Hollywood system! This fact alone should guarantee a fan's price of admission. Okay, I'm getting off the soap-box.    I enjoyed this film and when I purchase the Blu-Ray I will continue to enjoy this film. I am grateful Romero is still making movies (especially the zombie ones although I am a huge fan of Bruiser as well) and I hope Romero continues to make more.
B0034JKZ3G|1.0|'The Princess and the Frog' delivers on all levels.  It showcases the magic and art that is Disney hand-drawn animation.  It gives us a sublime soundtrack, returns to the wonderful, musical format that all long-time fans of the studio know and love (we all grew up with it!).  I cannot recommend this film highly enough! (Ray the firefly is fantastic!!)    Why then only a 1 star rating for the Blu-Ray DVD 3 disc set, you ask?  Simple:  the amazing and vibrantly creative business that Walt Disney created and nurtured has become a money-grubbing, greedy empire.  Children may watch Disney films but they certainly don't BUY the DVDs...ADULTS in their lives do.  ADULTS shell out their hard-earned (in most cases) bucks for these DVDs and believe it or not there are adults who DON'T have kids that are fans of the films too (myself included).    I enjoy the behind-the-scenes extras that Disney Studios includes on most of their DVD releases.  They are the main reason I BUY the DVDs instead of just renting them.  I have a perfectly good DVD player.  I do not want or need a Blu-Ray disc player and I resent the fact that I would be forced to buy a (very expensive) 3 disc package that includes a useless (to me) Blu-Ray disc in order to get a plethora of behind the scenes special features.  The regular DVD release of this film includes one brief and not so special making of featurette. Keep this set, I'll be renting 'PATF' instead.    Bad form Disney....very bad form.
B0002234LS|5.0|This was a very good movie. How could it not be really? It's based on Stephen King and stars Johnny Depp. Speaking of, Johnny Depp did a superb job as always. I can't say I've ever seen a bad Depp flick. It keeps you watching til the end thats for sure. I would definetly recommend it. It earns all five stars in my eyes.
0143036556|2.0|I bought this book based on my fond memories of Guns, Germs and Steel from a college class, but either this book is far inferior or my tastes have changed since then.  Collapse is needlessly verbose -- it hashes and rehashes the same points over and over, reminding you of ideas just explained a few pages ago as if you have the memory of a goldfish, then summarizing again at the end in specific detail.  It felt as though the book is designed to be used as a textbook, with blatant emphasis points and easily extracted test questions (\\"Name 9 of the 12 reasons for societal collapse...\\") instead of a serious study of the subject (I guess Diamond knows where his bread is buttered).  Add this to the fact that although he has extremely valid arguments, the subtext fails to mention that the book focuses ONLY on environmental factors of societal collapse (i.e., all collapse causes lead to or are caused by environmental factors) and the author writes with a serious environmental agenda.  It's a shame, because I think the subject is one that deserves serious attention and one that I agree with almost completely, but the book's patronizing tone, both scholarly and enviro-politically, left a bad taste in my mouth.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Everyone should agree this is a great documentary, from the right and the left. Certainly tells it like it is. This should bring everyone together.

They've got a good sound, great voice, and the music fits nearly every situation.  I just wish that both of the cds that I have purchased didn't sound like one very long song.

Mr. Brown's a wonder!...\\" They love the \\"dip dops\\" and the \\"pips\\"! They love to try to repeat all of the sounds when they're listed in rhyme. The illustrations are captivating and the words run together like a charm! You'll be reading and re-reading this book, and then your beginning readers will read it to you!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I thought this film was very stirring and respectful of the great sacrifices made by Marines. I read Sledge's book \\"With the Old Breed,\\" so I was excited to see a movie about his experiencens during and after the war. The acting was great, some bright young stars with promising futures. I also appreciated the commentary from the Vets. Every American should watch this movie.

B000002J0N|4.0|This is one of those albums that raises the metaphoric middle-finger to \\"conventional opinion,\\" which said that Crosby, Stills and Nash was a spent force by the time they recorded and released this album in 1977. Baloney. This is, in fact, a stupendous album made BY grown-ups FOR grown-ups. If it has no incandescent moments of flashy show, what compensates are solid songs (mostly)and solid musicianship (totally). There's an air about this album of \\"after all the crazy times, what we have left are some of the lessons we've learned along the way and some of the questions we still have.\\" Self-deprecation abounds; it's in Still's plaintive \\"See The Changes\\" and Crosby's reflective \\"Anything At All.\\" Both songs are somber, but more with bemusement than pathos, with both Stills and Crosby looking hard at themselves and not being totally pleased by what they see. Nash, for his part, takes more of the snapshot approach, looking at what's happened to him at various points in his life (up to that time) and how it's hit him. \\"Cathedral\\" and \\"Cold Rain\\" are the two best examples of that, as well as being the most elaborately produced tracks on the album. Those signature harmonies are as potent as ever, harking back to when they really were a special, musical experience. It may not be the case now, but that in no way diminishes the impact of this album, arguably CSN's finest.

B0036EH3WU|2.0|This is a review of the Complete 6 disc Collection, so the review is for the whole show.  But, since this 6 disc set contains hundreds of hours of viewing, I don't want to give away the ending.  So, I'll give you an analogy to help you determine if you want to spend the money for the Complete Collection.  The LOST Story would be like if I tell you a story about the best pig farm in the world.  I spend hours and hours telling you about the mud hole the pigs roll in, describing pig pens, hundreds of other interesting animal husbandry stuff.  I tell you about how the pig farmer is planning on getting more pigs, which will put the pigs in a crowded condition.  Since you are a pig farming enthusiast, you listen enthralled.  And, you're really worried about the pigs being too crowded, you want to hear more about what is going to happen to the pig pens.  But, then I start telling you about all the interesting animals on the pig farm.  Like the goose and the rats who steal the pig's food, the dog that protects the pigs from the wolves, and the chickens who lay the eggs.  I spend a lot of time telling you about a baby duck that always wanders to close to the snake pit.  You're worried about the baby duck.  Since you love animals, you listen intently and are enthralled.  And, you really want to know if the baby duck is going to get eaten by the snakes.  But, then I tell you about the Land Commissioner who want's to put a freeway through the land the pig farm is on.  I describe in detail the angry conversations between the pig farmer and the land commissioner.  The pig farmer and land commissioner get into a fist fight.  As a serious environmentalist, you continue to listen and are enthralled.  I tell you about the land surveyor who comes out and spends a lot of time petting the dog, in addition to measuring the land.  You are REALLY worried, you love the pig farm and you don't want to see it destroyed.  Then I tell you about the upcoming Holiday Season.  All the holiday decorations and how one of the string of lights is about ready to short out and burn the house down.  I tell you about the big holiday party that's planned.  And, how the pig farmer is going to butcher the goose for the big holiday dinner.  You're upset.  You loved the goose.  You loved all the crazy stuff the goose did in the story, you loved how he started out as a bad goose and redeemed himself and became a good goose by scaring away a small coyote from eating one of the lambs.  You now are really listening and are enthralled.  But, then in the last minutes of the story I tell you about how the pig farmer suddenly becomes a vegetarian because he choked on a chicken bone and he released the goose to join a flock of geese flying south for the winter.  The story ends.  You are really happy because you loved that goose and you start to cry with tears of joy as the goose flies off into the sunset with the other geese.  But, then it dawns on you . . . . . .  Hey, wait a minute !!!!  What about the pig farm, what about the pig pens, what about the crowded conditions, the pig farmer, the land commissioner ???  What about that crazy land surveyor who wouldn't leave the dog alone ????  is the freeway going to destroy the pig farm ???  Are holiday lights going to short out and burn down the house and kill all the people at the party ???  What about that damn baby duck !!!!!!  Yeah, you are glad the goose didn't die and it really was a beautiful ending with him flying off into the glorious sunset.  But, what about ALL the other stuff ????  You're pissed.  You're disappointed.  You're hurt.  You loved hearing about the Pig Farm, you loved hearing about the animals, you loved the suspense about Freeway, you actually enjoyed the fist fight because the pig farmer kicked the land commissioner's ass, you loved hearing about the upcoming Holiday Season.  But,  You feel like I was just telling you a bunch of stuff to keep you listening to me adding more and more twists and turns to the story...... and you still don't know what happened to all the stuff you really cared about.  You feel cheated.  If you haven't seen LOST and decide to buy the entire 6 disc set. . . . . after you finish watching all 6 seasons:  About 25% of you will feel that way.  About 25% will have loved the goose so much and it was such a beautiful ending, all other stuff won't matter in the slightest.  The remaining 50% will fall somewhere between the two.  Personally, I wouldn't spend the money for the Complete Collection because re-watching it won't be satisfying once you know the ending.  And, I'm still pissed because I don't know if that damed baby duck grew up and lived happily ever after.....at least until Duck Hunting Season.
B001GCUO5M|3.0|When I saw the trailer when the movie was first out, I already knew what was going on.  Either they gave out too much or this was just really very old school stuff.    Nothing is really special about this movie. It is fast paced but no drama. They try to spice it up with some WW2 stuff but it doesn't really add anything to the story.    This is a ok movie but don't expect something out of the world from it.

0767817664|5.0|This is a great movie that is fast paced and with great lovable characters. The movie is fun to watch and the story does have some depth to it. You will cheer loudly when the loser finally becomes the hero. I love the scene where Dracula laughs at the vampire killer who is holding the cross with his shaky hand. That scene is so much fun to watch.    5 stars!  Must see!

Overall an excellent book.

B001HN69AY|5.0|After waiting for it to come out on DVD, I just saw TIODP last night.  Here are a couple of observations and insights that may be helpful.    (i) Visuals  I unfortunately watched this movie on a non-Blue Ray DVD player on a 26 inch T.V.  Within minutes, I realized that I had really robbed myself not seeing this at the theater.   The visuals were absolutely jaw-dropping and literally breath-taking; some of the richest, most imaginative imagery I have ever seen on film.  I often have concerns that Hollywood technology has outpaced Hollywood creativity with the endless over-produced streams of Iron Man 2's and Prince of Persias being the fruit of this folly.  This movie has restored my faith that there is new and creative stories to be told and interesting and important ideas to be imagined.      Terry Gilliam has always been in the forefront of visual style (Brazil, Time Bandits, 12 Monkeys), but has never really had the tools that are brought to bear in this outing.  When I saw the effects-saturated previews, I was a little concerned that Gilliam may be starting down the trail blazed by Tim Burton, who long ago abandoned any artistic or storytelling pretense, replacing them with what pretty much amounts to a technology showcase (anyone see Alice in Wonderland?).  So I was really worried about what would be lost in translating Gilliam's ideas onto a digital palette.  I was pleasantly surprised that Gilliam has not gone down this road at all; his strange and interesting effects complement the mood and style of the movie, without consuming or overrunning them. Yes, there was visual panache and pizzazz, but the rest of the movie was not an excuse to get it on the screen.    As for the visuals themselves, they were absolute masterpieces.  I am not sure if anyone could watch the imagination sequences and not think of Salvatore Dali or other surrealists; it really reminded me of Destino, Dali's aborted collaboration with Walt Disney (Yes, really.  Look it up.)  Yet beyond their sheer artistry, these sequences have a way of mixing the surrealist dreariness with satire and whimsy, signifying to me that no one was taking themselves too seriously.      (ii) Acting  The acting for most of the characters was good, but nothing to write home about.  Heath Ledger's performance was ok, but far inferior to his masterful (and Oscar winning) turn as the Joker last year; he is just not as flamboyant and slick as the role demanded.  Christopher Plummer was fine - really he didn't venture far beyond doing \\"hysterical old coot\\" for most of the movie.  Colin Ferrell, Jude Law, and Lilly Cole were so-so, but really kind of mediocre talents to begin with.  It was refreshing to see that Verne Troyer has evolved beyond Mini-Me, but he is still really used more as a set-piece than an independent character in this one.     However, I should point out two notable exceptions to the general rule.  First, Tom Waits is just absolutely awesome as resident Satan figure, Mr. Nick.  His silky voice and crystal cool demeanor was just entrancing; every time he came on the screen was a singular pleasure - true, it was a creepy, skin-crawling, punch to the gut, check-if-your-soul-is-still-there kind of pleasure, but still.  (As a short sidenote, anyone who doesn't know Waits' music needs to stop reading this review and go order Rain Dogs right now... We'll wait).  Second, Johnny Depp's short turn as Mr. Ledger's Imaginarium's alter-ego is a precision mix of carnival barker and slippery gigolo; I was sorry that there was so little of him in the movie.     (iii) Story  Ok, if there is one particular that I could get caught up on not being the best, it would probably be the story.  It seems that they started with a really neat idea - Doctor Parnasus can facilitate one stepping into his imagination.  He has a second-rate traveling show pedaling the experience to a disinterested and cynical populous.  On the side, he has made a deal with the devil, wagering his only child against a bet to be the first to claim five souls through his Imaginarium against Mr. Nick's competing visions.  That is the seed of a really neat idea, but the actual mechanics of the thing really don't live up to the promise.  There is a lot of dialogue filler and an extraneous character or two that really didn't push things forward and meandered into subplots which really didn't add to the story much.  Also, part of the mystery that Gilliam weaves requires not showing all the cards in his hand at once (or at all for that matter).   This makes the plot interesting and adds to the atmosphere, but also makes the story kind of incomprehensible at some points.  You have to fill in a lot of narrative gaps and, as a result, viewers will not walk away with the same understanding of the story or even its resolution.   I was a little put off by this, but then again if I hated narrative or moral ambiguity, Tom Clancy also has a number of selections available.      Final note (and SPOILER ALERT), doesn't being hanged generally kill one by cutting off blood to one's carotid artery, not by suffocation, making a metal tube down your trachea really kind of irrelevant?  Is it just me?    (iv) Conclusion  Five Stars and no regrets.    Unlike some of the other reviewers, I will not pat myself on the back for having discovered some kind of high art, unappreciated by the bourgeoisies masses.  It is quirky and different and I think you have to have an appreciation of movies beyond the mega-plex to really get into it (I mean, er... the other mega-plexes which didn't show this movie), but wouldn't consider it art house cinema.  I enjoyed it a lot and thought that the visual style alone commands a strong recommendation.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Excellent movie. Completely rewrote what was possible in modern film.

Flawless video and audio. Glad I purchased : )
0312570740|1.0|This book is slanderous, poorly written, tendentious, and repetive.  Two hundred pages attempting to convince readers that \\"ethics\\" are dated, that Marc Rich is a victim of some vast political conspiracy, and that if you are a Jew you deserve special treatment even if being prosecuted for Crimes.     The last point I find the most disturbing, and in need of elaboration.     As an offspring of Holocaust survivors, I feel their odyssey tarnished and ridiculed by a book which at every turn deliberately exploits the Holocaust to dredge up unwarranted sympathy for Marc Rich, and at many a turn smears those interested in the Marc Rich case as driven by Anti-Semitism.  This is an insult to me, my parents, the Jewish people, and history.     It is doubtful this book was written without the approval of Avner Azulay, Marc Rich's intel operative. I have a word of advice for Avner- next time you want to whitewash your boss's image, please leave Jews out of it. Keep your shmata to yourself. Just don't go there.  I suggest you get a better journalist to do your job ,if you can't do without it. Mr. Ammann clearly has trouble with his writing style, as his chapters read like newspaper articles disconnected from what came before and what comes after.     The actual information content of the book - could have been compressed into a nice New Yorker or Vanity Fair article. The reader learns virtually nothing until two thirds into the book, and even that is limited to five pages.     The clincher is in the author's final observation that it was all Richard Nixon's fault. It was Nixon who interfered with the markets Marc Rich saught to liberate!  For someone whose central argument is that \\"morals\\" don't exist and that the world cannot be seen in \\"black and white\\" that's a mighty cavalier conclusion.     Ammann asks his readers to believe that this was the first time he had met Marc Rich, a man who for the first time was granting interviews. Yet he glibly mentions that as a journalist hehad written and communicated to Marc Rich previously for at least a decade! This begs the question whether Ammann knew Azulay or anyone who was close to Rich. But don't expect any answers.      Peons to America's core values ring hollow when we learn that America remains too dangerous a place for Marc Rich, because  those willy Americans will jail him for a parking ticket. For a man who is supposed to be driven by risk taking and courage, that's a mousy reason to avoid defending his reputation in the country which Ammann credits with unparalleled genius.    Last but not least, Ammann's grasp on ethnics leaves a lot to be wished, and this might tie into the overall nature of the book. Quoting a professor from LSE who tells us that traditional morality is superseded by Capitalist emphasis on courage, risk taking, and innovation, one might be forgiven the obvious question about Marc Rich's complete lack of courage to defend himself in an American courtroom. Not to mention the obvious parallel between today's age of profligacy, ending in financial meltdown, and the traditional values attributed to capitalism, hard work, thriftiness, and modesty.     I do not recommend this book to anyone. The pretense at both objectivity and the pretentious dismissivness of criticism/ethics is jarring. The book should carry a disclaimer - paid for and written by the Marc Rich foundation. Even if this is not the case, it is the de facto result. Ammann should not have entirelly ignored Copetas work, and if he had sought anything approaching \\"objectivity\\" Ammann would have allowed S. Weinberg and others involved in the case to counter the arguments presented on behalf of Marc Rich. That however, doesn't happen. The book is a one way attack on everyone and anyone who doesn't sympathize with former fugitive. And the \\"ethics\\" issue was raised by Ammann. No one asked him to wade into it, hence pointing it out in a review is perfectly legitimate.     Perhaps all of this amounts to an argumentin favor of the book, rather than against. After all, if Ammann's book is the very reflection of the mind of the man it portrays, perhaps the readers irritation and outrage is precisely what a healthy human being should feel.
B000026FOA|4.0|I only recently heard of Nick Drake after watching the BBC documentary on him titled \\"Lost Boy: In Search of Nick Drake,\\" and it was more a surreal film directed by the likes of Roger Waters than a simple film crew. (I found out later it was a radio program, so the visuals for this were an afterthought.) However, this doc was a labor of love, so I decided to search out Nick's music, especially after hearing a cross section of his only 3 album output.<br /><br />This is my review for the first part of that trilogy, as some people have come to call it, \\"Five Leaves Left.\\"<br /><br />I was seriously blown away.<br /><br />This came at me in a slow mellow come-easy mix of mental collages and slides through your mind like a good tasting sandwich with some cold icy water. Each song is filled a story of loss, or longing, or reaching out, and will crush any notions about what you may have heard in passing about Nick's bleak sad history.<br /><br />Was he troubled? Yes. Was he in pain and depressed and on medications to somehow try and control him? Sure. Did he take them all the time, knowing it would squelch his creativity? No.<br /><br />Nick, by all accounts, was depressive, and didn't care about the fame, and didn't want to be famous, but sadly after his death, he left music which is timeless for the listener, and could be anonymously be released now and it would have become a number one album for anyone who would want to claim it.<br /><br />And that's my problem.<br /><br />Music has evolved (without Nick) to such a point in the last 10 years that this kind of sound, the lone artist with the acoustic guitar/orchestral mix of sound, is so prevalent now it gets lost among the crashing swells of hip-hop, crappy rock and other mostly sorry excuses for music.<br /><br />It's become so commonplace that it sits proudly on the lite rock/alternative stations worldwide and you can find any 19 year old with a guitar uploading their latest music online or on iTunes for you to download, and most of it all sounds like this. BUT... let's look at Nick's work first, because he pretty much originated this style. 10 songs at just under 60 minutes:<br /><br />01. \\"Time Has Told Me\\" - this opening riff, with intimate lyrics and almost a country feel, reminds me so quickly of Simon and Garfunkel's \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" which was recorded only a year later. Did Paul Simon hear this song and copy it, or was it a matter of coincidence? The lyrics here are definitely more upbeat, though...<br />02. \\"River Man\\" - this is one of the best songs on the album, hands down. It's intimate without trying, and it's an effortless mix of lyrics and song, and if you were to only hear one song on this album, this is Nick's Mt. Everest.<br />03. \\"Three Hours\\" - this song, even though the lyrics are upfront about a couple of men on a flight from the west to London, and the music has a slight Mediterranean feel, just somehow reminds me of Jesus on the cross - and it's odd yet wonderful alliteration if I'm able to do pull something from that! The song sounds so urgent, too...<br />04. \\"Way to Blue\\" - this has got to be one of the more psychedelic songs, and it is early 1969, after all... Nick was trying to pull every fleeting reference to slipping away and tripping away as he could out of his bag.<br />05. \\"Day Is Done\\" - this has Jim Croce's \\"Time In A Bottle\\" and especially \\"Lover's Cross\\" all over it, from the hurried minor chords on the guitar to the swelling orchestral background sweeping through it towards the middle and end. I knew it sounded familiar. Regardless, I like Nick's so much I'm willing to forgive Jim for it.<br />06. \\"'Cello Song\\" - this is such a strong song, and the lyrics toell the listener that it's OK, Nick's got it, he'll shield you from the madness and the badness, let him just play his music for you... and the cello doesn't hurt, either.<br />07. \\"The Thoughts of Mary Jane\\" - let's face it, this is the most polished and \\"commercial\\" of all the songs - for 1969. The veiled references to drugs, the lifting lyrics accompanied by flute, it pains me to say it, but this also the weakest song on the album, too. It's just too dated, no matter what many may say.<br />08. \\"Man in a Shed\\" - this song is funny and fun and at the same time so depressing and fruitless, but the song makes a point - loneliness can have it's merits - besides, \\"sheds are nicer than you thought\\"...<br />09. \\"Fruit Tree\\" - this song tells of the perils of the fleeting fame, and of friends, and of acquaintances who will love you one moment and say 'who was he?' the next, and the only place you are sure you can feel safe in this life was when you were in the womb, or as an a adult, a womb-like space, black and quiet. This song goes pretty deep, and it has it's moments.<br />10. \\"Saturday Sun\\" - to use the sun and moon and the rain and the sky as actual people are a theme in Nick's writing, but to put entire days together in a easy little song about Sunday's loss of his good friend Saturday? Wow...!<br /><br />Nick was an pioneering inventor of the melding of intimate lyrics combined with the muted tones of the orchestra, kind of like Leonard Cohen, but not with all the depression attached to it. He was a genius as Syd Barrett was, and Mozart. All of them died young, forgotten for years, and then suddenly a new generation \\"finds\\" them and reveres them.<br /><br />This is nothing new, but Nick's work is still very special, and worth take a listen to. I only took a star off because, honestly, some of the songs are a bit dated, but then again a new generation has \\"found\\" this style of playing music, and by God they're running with it.<br /><br />Sorry to say, Nick would get trampled at the very temple of music he helped create, because they want their 15 minutes, and they'd hit anyone with an acoustic guitar to get there.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.

B002ZG98Z0|3.0|As with the first Sex and the City film, Sex and the City II is more or less \\"review-proof.\\"  The films are made for fans that are already well-immersed in the characters from the TV series, and these fans are just as interested in seeing what everyone is up to and what they're wearing as they are in a coherent plot or deeper meanings.  For fans of SATC, more is more.    So I guess this makes SATC2 a big success.  It's nearly two and a half hours long.  It features more costume changes than ever, and it takes its decadence to a whole new level.  Yet the franchise is starting to feel forced and flaccid.  Seeing SATC2 was like visiting a favorite old restaurant and realizing that the dish you used to love just isn't quite the same anymore.  The ingredients are all there, but they haven't been prepared quite right or with any loving attention.    Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) is still married to \\"Big\\" (Chris Noth), and it's been about 2 years.  He wants to start settling in to a quieter, domestic life (he enjoys cuddling on the sofa watching old B&W movies) but she wants to continue to lead an active, late-night social life.  She throws the equivalent of a hissy-fit, and poor Big just can't seem to do anything to make her happy.  For the first time, Big is more sympathetic than whinny Carrie.  Carrie has always been a difficult character to like, because even though she is big-hearted and witty and sparkly...she's also always been the most damagingly selfish girl of the bunch.    Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is having trouble being appreciated at work.  Charlotte (Kristen Davis) is feeling overwhelmed by a particularly terrible two-year-old, and threatened by a particularly buxom nanny.  Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is grappling with menopause.      So when the opportunity arises for \\"the girls\\" to get away from it all for a bit by taking a trip to Abu Dhabi (all expenses paid at a luxury resort that makes any luxury suite we've ever seen in a Las Vegas movie look likea dump)...off they go in a swirl of silk and cotton.  Minor complications ensue as each works out their issues while wearing some ridiculous costumes.  (I think it must be a law now that Miranda cannot be allowed to wear anything even remotely flattering.)    Time for disclosure.  I'm a 46 year old man...not exactly the normal target audience.  But my wife and I watched the series together...and to be honest, I've always enjoyed it.  While it's hardly my favorite show of all time, I didn't have to have my arm twisted to see the films either.  So perhaps my reactions are skewed.  But I get the appeal of SATC.  I've enjoyed the sharp writing, the interesting characters and the feeling of NYC being a true character too.  So, how did SATC2 fall short?  First of all, sending them to Abu Dhabi absolutely felt more than a little like the series was \\"jumping the shark.\\"  Although many amusing things happen, it's as though \\"The City\\" held no more inspiration for the filmmakers.  In the first film, the girls escape to Mexico...but it feels wrong.  They are having a difficult time and being away from the city adds to that sense of dis-ease...and makes those scenes successful.  Going to the desert feels a little like the season when Lucy Ricardo and company went to Europe...a transparent effort to keep up the ante.  Heck, SATC2 even has a major wedding scene that takes place in Connecticut.    Also, Carrie is more annoying than usual.  Can't she see how perplexed and hurt she has left Big?  Charlotte's problems seem quite petty (her two-year-old cries all the time like an infant...those aren't the terrible twos...if my two year old carried on that way, I'd take her to the hospital)...and they feel like they were written by a man who doesn't understand domesticity and child-rearing.  The best they could come up with was a sexy Irish nanny who doesn't wear a bra and making Charlotte fearful that her husband would stray.  Like anyone who knows the show believes Harry would do that!  Miranda quits her job...and that's about it.  Never has she been given a more minor role than in this film.  She is hardly one-quarter of the action...perhaps one-tenth.  And Samantha's antics seem more desperate.  And that sort of sums up the film.  These actresses...all lovely...are now being asked to act and behave much younger than they are.  And the cracks show.  It's not just that the layers of pancake makeup can't hide the lines around Parker's eyes...it's that there is simply no way that women with the experiences these four have had would act in the ways they do.  They've always been outrageous, yes.  But they now frequently lean towards being cartoonish.    The series now feels caught in another generation.  To me, the best example comes early on.  Everyone is attending a gay wedding, and guess who performs the civil ceremony?  Liza Minelli!  That's fairly random, but worth a laugh.  Later, she performs (and we're asked to believe that she would do this) at the reception, by singing and dancing Single Ladies for Beyonce...replicating the signature choreography from the video.  Too bad this joke has already been thoroughly played out...the football players on Glee already did it.  The female chipmunks in the latest Alvin and the Chipmunks film did it.  And even Beyonce herself spoofed it with the male members of Saturday Night Live.  So including this bit in the film feels like a grab for hipness by a filmmaker caught in the `90s but trying to seem \\"up on what the kids are doing these days.\\"      In the end, I think the film simply doesn't speak to anything real anymore.  I'd still go see another sequel, because I have enough goodwill for the original series...but they'd better step up their game and refocus on what really makes the series work on more than a superficial level.  Because with SATC2, \\"superficial\\" was all we got.
0802136834|5.0|I LOVE this book! I have had it for about 2 weeks and don't have much time to read but I'm already almost finished. It is very detailed and is written so that the 'average' history lover can still read and enjoy!
B003C1QIO6|4.0|First listen to Jack Johnson's new CD \\"To the sea\\" and you'd be forgiven for thinking it's more of the same. Johnson's music invokes images of guitar playing on the beach by a campfire and this is no different.<br /><br />\\"You and your heart\\" opens the album in jaunty form and is catchy, it became his first US top 20 hit a few weeks back. \\"To the sea\\" is a lulling ditty with quivery guitars and an edgy guitar solo.<br /><br />The Blues-tinged \\"At or with me\\" has a nice start-stop effect with the instrumentation. The brief \\"When I look up\\" reminds one of The Beach Boys, while \\"From the clouds\\" has a light Reggae lilt. \\"My little girl\\" is a tender acoustic ballad with lyrics that sound like a father's wise words to his child.<br /><br />\\"Turn your love\\" is calming with wonderful harmonies, while \\"The upsetter\\" features slightly complex rhythms. The cleverly titled \\"Pictures of people taking pictures\\" is an absolute gem, as is the quivering \\"Only the ocean\\".<br /><br />So yes, it is more of the same at first listen, but with just the right tweaks and nuances making it one of his most upbeat and diverse collections yet.
B00000JCB2|4.0|I recently acquired a secondhand copy of this album. The last time I had listened to it was roughly ten years ago, at which time this was one of the coolest metal/rap crossover albums you could wish to own. Fast forward to 2010...<br /><br />Some of it has dated not so well, but if the modern listener digs around a bit he/she will still discover some true gems. The scowling groove that is Nookie still hits the spot just fine, while Re-arranged is an almost Chili Peppers-esque slice of beautiful melancholy (yes, really!) complete with a ramblingly dextrous bassline. The angsty self-loathing of No Sex has dated a lot better than the rather immature Break Stuff, and perhaps best of all is the excellent N 2 Gether Now, which still stands as one of the Wu Tang Clan's most effective collaborations. Elsewhere we find one or two blatant Korn rip-off riffs, but this doesn't really detract from the overall effect too much...and besides, plenty of other bands (ahem, Coal Chamber) were busy making careers out of impersonating Korn at the time (late Nineties/early Noughties).<br /><br />All in all, this album has stood the test of time surprisingly well and it was a pleasure to get re-acquainted with it. Tremendous!
0131103628|5.0|Everything to be said about this book was already said by many. Then, why do I bother to add one more? Because this book deserves five *****, not ****1/2.    I picked up this book in fall 1989 from a Software Etc store. That was the luckiest moment in my career. I was just assigned with my first C programming project with no opportunity to be trained. So, I decided to train myself. After browsing a few available C books, I chose this book. It looked professionally written, and the concise volume attracted me (I did not have much time to learn). I began reading that night and, within an hour of reading, I was fascinated. I already had 8 years of experience in mainframe programming languages: FORTRAN, PL/I, and mainly Assembler. But, since I had no computer science major and no PC or Unix programming experience, it was my first encounter with C. The concise, mathematical-formula like C language format shocked me. I kept on reading for several hours each night, skipping a few hard-to-read chapters, such as Unix System Interface, Reference Manual, and Standard Library. So, I only needed to read about 170 pages out of 270 pages. It took me about 6 or 7 days.    Yes, the book does not even teach how to compile. It didn't matter. Our mainframe C compiler was yet to be installed and my first PC was built years later. So, I had nothing to do other than lying down on my sofa and reading pages after pages, highlighting some interesting phrases. That helped absorbing the entire contents in short time with no interruption. How to compile was learned several weeks later when we finally had a C compiler available. By that time, I already had a good knowledge on C and was even able to give advices to others who were luckily sent to an expensive C training class but still unable to understand.     This is one magical book - a technical book that is 270-page short and is still perfect for a life time companion, a book that fits well with every skill levels: beginner, intermediate, and expert. The chapters I skipped as a beginner became meaningful later and the concise Standard Library in Appendix B has been referenced over and over. Today, my colleagues call me a C guru sometimes. I'm not entitled to it at all, but I consider myself a sort of C expert. This is the only C book that I still references whenever I have a doubt.     The authors of this book are also the creators of the C language and the Unix operating system. There was a rumor in the Internet that the creators admitted Unix, C Hoax that they created them out of parody to be as complex and cryptic as possible to maximize casual user's frustration level and set the computer science progress back 20 or more years. Hoax or not, I would like to excuse them, for they created such an exemplary book like this. This book must be an important reason for their success.    Yes, the price tag may be relatively high for the book of this size. It cost me $35 twenty years ago. It could be equivalent of about $80 today. Its current list price is $60, and Amazon offers it $39 today, nearly the same price as 20 years ago. What a bargain! Besides, who can complain about the price when one tiny book can make a guru out of you for the rest of your life? You could even trade a programmer's soul for it.     Alas! I wish I had the same luck with the C++ language. It took me as many YEARS, rather than DAYS, and numerous books before I reached a comfortable level in C++ language and OOP. I highly respect Stroustrups' book, The C++ Programming Language, but it is 900 pages long, packed with overwhelming number of features. It was beyond my concentration limit to finish the C++ book in one period, and, while I was learning new, I was also losing what I learned before - it was never close to my experience with The C Programming Language.
B001FB55L2|5.0|It's very rare to have a new movie now a days with this much impact.  The casting was perfect...down to the little kids.  I would totally recommend this movie to anybody.  Even kids, despite the fact it does contain some bad language.  I think the youth of America could benefit from a film like this.  5 stars, all the way around!

B001FB563E|5.0|This film was completely depressing and at the same time I would say it was a masterpiece. This is how the end of   the world would probably be, not the silly little farce as in the film 2012. I know I am going to start stocking the pantry with weapons and canned goods, maybe we all should.
044024367X|5.0|I'm seeing this trend among the Amazon reviews that if a book displays any sort of \\"Liberal\\" viewpoint (I guess what some people have been brainwashed into believing is a liberal viewpoint) then it gets trashed with 1 star reviews. I for one have started many books that didn't do it for me and I've simply put them back on the shelf and moved on...I certainly don't run to my computer and write a long essay on why it is so terrible and why I hated it so much.If you like the Reacher novels then this is another solid entry. These books are entertainment...meant to be enjoyed over a few nights and then you move on to the next one. I enjoy the books of Brad Thor and he definitely has a \\"conservative\\" bent to his books but it doesn't bother me a bit..I could care less. For those who say things like \\"How dare Lee Child who is from England comment on American politics\\" You seem to forget every American is basically an immigrant so please grow up and get over whatever inferiority complex you have that makes you get so appalled if someone doesn't share the same views as you. As I say if you like Reacher ignore all these shady 1 star reviews as they certainly seem to have some sort of agenda behind them. As for Reacher having a negative opinion about the Iraq war...The war has resulted in over a Hundred Thousand deaths.....enough said.

B001NLL93W|5.0|this trilogy is simply amazing. they took the used-to-the-limit figures of werewolves,vamps,faeries,and warlocks and completely transformed them to something captivating. my favorite character has to be...MAGNUS! i love him. =) anyway, something i really liked was the author's perverted sense of humor. i nearly died laughing at some parts. on the other hand, some scenes were so emotional they had me crying or screaming along with the characters. AMAZING BOOK!
0439023483|5.0|The Game of Hunger       This action-packed book by Suzanne Collins has a lot of violence.  The Hunger Game is fiction, but there is some truth to all the violence. The North American government of Panama makes twenty four randomly selected children kill each other on the battlefield. This cruel government is doing this to remind its citizens not to rebel. Katniss, a 16 year old girl that volunteered for the games to make sure her 12 year old sister does not have to fight, shows true quick-wittedness and bravery on the battlefield.  Katniss has to kill the twenty-three other teenagers, or be killed herself.      During battle, love blossoms between Katniss and another contestant named Peeta. It is hard for them to connect emotionally, because Katniss likes another person back home named Gale with whom she hunts. Katniss feels guilty about the relationship, because at first she pretends to love Peeta only to win favor from the crowd which would help her in battle. Although her love was false at the beginning, she grew to genuinely like Peeta. Katniss knew that Gale would be watching, and she could never really decide who she liked best.      The book is intense and it grabbed my attention from the start. It is a great book that has twists and turns throughout. The government gives advantages to certain people and tries to eliminate the love between Katniss and Peeta.  This book is quite exciting.  It is gut-wrenching, incredibly entertaining, and a book that everyone should read.     Patrick Kurzner

People have not the faintest clue about what products or instruments they're investing in, what is going on, and how their actions affect the lives of many.<br /><br />Michael Lewis brings all of this to light, and has done so for many years (from Liar's Poker to Panic and now The Big Short).
B00062IDCO|5.0|Of all the Star Trek shows ever created, this is by far my favorite. Now that video tape is going out and DVD's are in, we are slowly adding back to our collection. Star Trek Voyager has some enduring characters, The Doctor, Seven Of Nine and Captain Janeway, the one and only female Star ship captain. Many episodes are humorous, some edgy, others revealing man's need to depend on others for survival. If you like  science fiction, this is the way to go.
B00006I53S|5.0|I a using this lens on a Canon XSi, and it has yielded fantastic results. The image quality is astounding if properly handled. The auto-focus is very fast and accurate. The field of view is a bit narrow at 28mm though, which is really its only downfall. Its very attractive aesthetically too! Highly suggested.
B0000047BA|3.0|Heard a bit of this on a late night FM station and knew I had to have it.John Lee Hooker and Miles Davis jam with Taj Mahal and a host of other cats doing what they do.It says written by Jack Nieitche the late great  Columbia A&R man/producer but I think he just assembled them and turned on the mics.Its long on atmosphere and short on new ideas just some uber cool noise from these pros.So many of these cats are gone with Dennis Hopper(director of the film) being the latest.Taj carries on  of course but you will never hear the likes of the guys in one studio again.A minor classic .

1597801577|5.0|Science fiction is alive and well, having shed its retrofuturistic dreams of space travel, and engaged again with with important explorations of the futures we might actually have.    The Windup Girl is set in a Bangkok on the edge of civil war - eerily timely, given events of the past weeks - between the Environment Ministry, charged with defense against bioweapons, enforcement of carbon limits, and a sustainable self-sufficiency tinged with fear of anything foreign, and the Trade Ministry, looking to start a new age of globalization after the collapse of the oil economy, and to line a few pockets along the way.    Thrown into the tinderbox are Anderson, a spy for the loathed agribusinesses who destroyed global civilization with plauges mobilized for IP enforcement, and Emiko, a discarded synthetic person, now a sex slave in an expatriates' nightclub.     Will they save a city on the brink of destruction, or supply the spark that burns it down?    Gripping, timely, entirely believable, The Windup Girl is a contemporary masterpiece of speculative fiction.
B0024ICWB6|4.0|The book arrived really quickly and in very good shape.  Haven't started reading it yet, but know it will be another great book by David Baldacci.
B002ZCY7QY|5.0|I don't know what the others are talking about when they say the show Chuck is getting worse, it's quite the contrary! Sure the first few episodes are a little too focused on Chuck and Sara's relationship, but on the side the other Characters were getting more interesting.  I think not only did the third season make Chuck look even more amazing but it also made Sara, Casey, Morgan,Devin and Elliot look awesome too and now Morgan, Devin and Elliot have bigger, more amazing parts in the show.    The last few episodes of Chuck were really the most amazing and action packed, but my favorite episode of the season was the last episode because that episode was the most action packed and it was two hours long instead of the usual one hour long episode.    I think the third season of Chuck was better than both seasons one and two.  The show Chuck just keeps getting better and better each and every season and I look forward to seeing the fourth season of Chuck especially after the producers really set up a lot for the next season.
B000022TSY|4.0|In the recent Associated Press obituary for the late actor and director, Dennis Hooper, is quoted as believing that, for him, the 1969 counter-cultural classic motorcycle film that he directed, \\"Easy Rider\\", was more a statement about the political landscape of the times than a male-bonding biker \\"road\\" movie. I agree with him, or at least that is how I have always viewed the film. The subjects of drugs, using and selling, dressing for \\"hippie' success, the hard road of rural communal living (or urban communal living, for that matter), and trying to cope with the \\"squares\\" and \\"rednecks\\" were all in a day's work back in the days for those of us committed to \\"seeking a newer world.\\".    In that sense \\"Easy Rider\\" is a very, very different road trip from that of the literary one in Jack Kerouac's 1957 \\"On The Road\\" (although the \\"action\\" of that book actually took place in the late 1940s). That small generational difference in time probably in cultural time was a matter of different epochs. The action of \\"On The Road\\" speaks to an almost subterranean escape from the bleakness of American conformity in the immediate post-World War II period behind the backs of the squares. The bikers, Fonda and Hopper (Wyatt and Billy, alright), in \\"Easy Rider\\" are up front and public, as reflected the change in mores of their times, about their \\"making and doing\\" as they confronted their version of American conformity in the 1960s. In the end they lost that public battle, and we have been fighting a rearguard series of \\"culture wars\\" battles ever since. But watch this film to get a slice of 1960s Americana. And if you are too young to know some of the references just ask mother and father (or the grandparents, ouch!). They WILL know.     Note: The late Doctor Gonzo\\", journalist Hunter Thompson, rather eloquently in HIS countercultural classic, \\"Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas\\", mentioned toward the end of that fearsome saga that sometime in the late 1960s he could almost see the high tide of the movement ebbing before his eyes signaling the end of all those fierce dreams that we had of that \\"newer world\\" and the beginning of the approach of the \\"night of the long knives.\\" \\"Easy Rider\\" is the cinematic take on that proposition
B003EYVXYQ|1.0|I can't even begin to explain just how horrible this movie was. Purchased it through Comcast's On-Demand service for $10 and feel like an idiot for wasting my money. If you know nothing about this film try to imagine a budget zombie movie with ridiculously bad special effects having sex with a badly acted Irish gang movie ... this is the result.     Aren't zombies supposed to be scary anymore? WTF was up with that zombie chick riding across the island on a horse? And Romero is the one that scoffs at \\"fast\\" zombies in other movies (all of which are worlds better than this disaster) and he has zombies riding around on horses?    What were Romero and whoever dared tag their name to this movie thinking when they put this turd together...?     The worst part is I really do hate giving this movie a bad review, as it drags down a genre I really love.

B002VKE1K2|1.0|I am truly surprised at how many people found this movie scary - if you have ever watched any paranormal activity show on TV/cable, you will have had bigger scares.

Tied with Blair Witch Project as one of the most over-rated movies ever.
B003C1QIO6|4.0|The new Jack Johnson CD has some of his best, and worst songs.  1. To the Sea- best song on the CD amazing 10/10  2. You and Your heart-9/10 awesome single catchy, vintage Jack, while changing it up at the same time  3. No Good with Faces-6/10 it was ok nothing special   4. At or with Me- 9/10 great song 2nd best of the album, upbeat  5. When I look up- 5/10, it's like 30 seconds there's not much to review  6. From the Clouds-8/10 great song love the sound  7. My little girl-8/10 touching, and great guitar  8. Turn Your love-7/10 decent sound kind of repetitive  9. The Upsetter-6/10 not bad kind of annoying   10. Red Wine Mistakes, Mythology- 8/10 great rock sound, great way to change it up, love the harmonica   11.Pictures of People taking Pictures- 4/10, kind of annoying, it's amazing how many times he says pictures of people taking by far worst song of the CD  12.Anything but the truth-6/10, it's a sweet sound, but I feel like I've heard it before, unoriginal  13.Only the Ocean-6/10, again sweet sound good guitar, but this feels like twenty of his other songs  14.Better together (new version)-9/10 great rendition of the song    All in all this is a very good CD I would give it a 7/10, It had it's moments where I was just smiling while I was listening, and others where I was a little frustrated. But Jack did come through for a fifth time. I feel like this is probably his third best album, behind In Between Dreams, and Sleep through the Static. He is showing a lot more of his guitar skills which I like. The songs are moving to becoming more and more complicated, great guitar rifts and piano, but he still has those goofy three chord love songs which I love. It was a little repetitive, but that's to be expected. All in all great job, I'm a huge Jack fan and he did not disappoint.

B001FB55L2|2.0|I had really big expectations of this movie, based on the \\"explosive emotional\\" tv trailers and commercials....shoulda just stuck with that. Tobey was very robotic and unconvincing as a \\"loving Dad\\" BEFORE he was deployed again. There didn't seem to be any chemistry with him as a Dad. I felt overall the acting was forced and didn't evoke any real emotions. I am very sensitive to emotional movies and this really didn't do it for. (Hey, I cried in CARS when Lightning pushed The King over the finish line!). The movie had lots of cliche type cheese (so bring the Triscuits!). The  movie was (for me) disconnected on many levels and cold heartless acting all around...except the little girl. The ending was a big let down too and it seemed that there could have been lots more to do with it then what was done. Golden Globe worthy? I think not.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I had this one pre-ordered (a first for me on the kindle). The first two books were so well written and so much fun to read I couldn;t wait to get this one.<br /><br />The conclusion of the millenium trilogy is a great read and a fitting end to an entertaining and thought-provoking arc. I really enjoyed it and heartily reccomend to any Lisbeth fans out there.<br /><br />There were a couple sections that i felt could be totally edited out and not impact the story. My eyes literally rolled back in my head during the several page chunks about the history of the Swedish Secret Police and the Political Procedures for challenging unconstitutional actions in a country without a supreme court. The information was not in my view central to the story and really took me out of it.<br /><br />The flaws are not catastrophic and the book is a great read.
B003102JDM|3.0|\\"The Serious Man\\" is the Coen brothers' reflection on the state of modern Judaism, in which the protagonist, a professor of quantum mechanics who lectures incessantly on the Schrodinger's cat paradox and the uncertainty principle, is subjected to a series of Jobian trials.  The film is similar to Archibald Macleish's \\"JB\\" in this regard, as an atheistic challenge of the Biblical parable, only with a much darker tone.  The story is about the emergence of mid western American Jews from the insulated cloister of the traditional Jewish community, with a stinging rebuke to those traditions, especially to rabbis.  I felt that the movie wove interesting web of subtext, symbolism, and meaning, but crucially, failed to entertain much and is probably only of interest to \\"serious\\" Jews.        The story follows the family of Larry Gopnick(principally himself and his son).  Larry faces a number of life trials.  His wife has fallen for a family friend and asks for a divorce.  He is bribed by a Korean student and his father.  The situation compounds itself, as he is involved in a car wreck and incurs lawyers' fees.  Meanwhile, Larry's 13yo son lethargically attends Hebrew school in preparation for his rite of passage.  He must deal with a school bully and a rabbi who confiscates his transistor radio.         Larry, in a state of existential crisis, seeks the spiritual guidance of three successive rabbis.  The first is younger than Larry himself, and seems fixated on the parking lot.  The second is wise and articulate and relates to Larry a parable of the \\"Goy's teeth\\".  This story within a story was far the most engaging part of the movie.  The story is a conundrum without a solution and offers Larry no direction at all.  Finally, Larry demands audience with the most senior rabbi, the exalted \\"Marshak\\".  Larry glimpses Marshak, idle within his study like a distant, non-intervening god, but the rabbi refuses to speak with him, claiming to be \\"busy\\".  Strangely, this was the wisestadvice any rabbi could have given to Larry!       The point of the three rabbis seems to be the utter bankruptcy of traditional Judaism in solving the problems of the real world.  Indeed, in the opening scene, set in a traditional Polish shtetl, the ancestral home of America's Jews, a Jewish wife stabs a rabbi, thinking him to be an evil spirit, underscoring the film's negative opinion of the traditional religion of Judaism.  When Larry's son approaches the great Marshak during his Bar Mitsvah, the boy observes biological specimens and displays, evocative of Darwinism, and the rationalism of evolutionary science.  Has the greatest religious thinker of all discovered agnosticism as well?  Marshak quotes to the boy the key lines of the movie's theme song, Jefferson Airplane's Want Somebody to Love:  \\"When the truth is revealed to be lies, and all the joy within you dies; don't you want somebody to love?\\", the \\"truth\\" in question being the revealed truth of traditional religion.       My main purpose in writing this review is to express my opinion of the cryptic final scene, which is generating debate.  At the Hebrew school, a tornado approaches.  While the incompetent rabbi fiddles with the lock to the shelter helpless to solve a real world problem, the children stare into the distance at the approaching cyclone.  The children figuratively stare into the maelstrom of a future of spiritual uncertainty; without the strong, unquestioned beliefs of traditional Judaism to guide them, whither will they bend their steps?         The movie offers an interesting window into Jewish society, but as I mentioned earlier fails to create an enjoyable story somehow.  The writers appear to have been too preoccupied with creating a hyper-symbolic hyper-artistic riddle of a movie, rather than a living piece of cinematic art.  The film might be more like a Talmud on a biblical story, rather than simply the story in its wild beauty.  Moreover, the Coens present a savagely stereotyped portrayal of a non-Jewish, middle American family in the form of the Gopnik's neighbors, a hunter and his small son.  The \\"goy's teeth\\" was good, though.

B001GCUO1Q|4.0|Gavin Hood directs this 2009 cinematic version of the origins (read ‘explanation’) or the X-Men series of comic book heroes based on a screenplay by David Benioff (‘Game of Thrones’ etc) and Skip Woods (‘Hitman’, ‘Swordfish’, ‘The A Team’ etc). The team manages to pull of the credibility-testing feat with aplomb – just the right amount of humanistic emphasis on the early ears of Wolverine and a flair for the impossible feats and countless deaths of the latter half of this film. It is a look at Wolverine's early life, in particular his time with the government squad Team X and the impact it will have on his later years.<br /><br />Leading up to the events of X-Men, X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's epically violent and romantic past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed, and the ominous Weapon X program. Two mutant brothers, Logan (Hugh Jackman) who will become Wolverine of the retractable claws and Victor (Liev Schreiber), born 200 years ago, suffer childhood trauma and have only each other to depend on. Basically, they're fighters and killers, living from war to war through U.S. history. In modern times, a U.S. colonel, Stryker (Danny Huston), recruits them and other mutants as commandos. Logan quits and becomes a logger, falling in love with a local teacher (Lynn Collins). When Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker's crew, the colonel sends the murderous Victor. Logan now wants revenge. Along the way, Wolverine encounters many mutants, both familiar and new, including surprise appearances by several legends of the X-Men universe (Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch, Dominic Monaghan, Daniel Henney, et al) whose appearances in the film series have long been anticipated.<br /><br />The first half of the film is sensitive and humanistic (Ryan Reynolds manages to insert his expected spot-on one liners to keep the story light) – the second half is pure CGI tricks (though according to the featurettes Hugh Jackman performed all his own choreographic fights). Better than expected and a really fascinating cast! Grady Harp, July 17own choreographic fights). Better than expected and a really fascinating cast! Grady Harp, July 17
B0031SCV46|4.0|I bought this at an in-store location on sale, not online. As far as quality, you get what you pay for. You should not be looking for grand piano feel & action from a controller a little over $100. If it had a few pads for playing beats that would be better. I know there is a controller, M-Audio AXIOM 49 Advanced 49-Key Semi-Weighted USB MIDI Controller, made by the same company that has that feature, but I guess I'm just looking for more for my dollar. My favorite controllers are [[ASIN:B002BFDOC8 Novation's 61 SL MkII Keyboard Controller]] and the [[ASIN:B001J7A5PS Studiologic VMK-188 Plus 88-Key Master Controller]]. The VMK-188 has the best action and feel I've ever encountered, as far as controllers are concerned, although Real pianos are still the king.
B001EAWMGA|1.0|I was browsing through the listing looking for a movie to watch and ran across this one I'd never heard of before with Jim Caviezel and John Hurt in it and thought if they were in it it's probably pretty good. I've always liked John Hurt's performances.     After about 30 minutes into the movie I realized why I've never heard of it, it stinks!! It must have dropped out of sight like a lead ballon after it was released for good reason..    I like the idea of the movie, space traveler from some other world meets humans from our past, but the plot was rushed and unconvincing. The guy on the horse was able to sneak up on Caviezel in the woods and knock the weapon out of his hands without him getting a shot off?!?! That was strike one.. Then they capture him and think he's the one who wiped out a whole village all by himself and he's the bad guy because the leader of that village will think they will be blamed. But just a short time later he's suddenly the hero wrapped in skins walking through the big doors to the feast and the french horns are playing hero music and they do the \\"shields\\" thing running around on top of shields?!? That was strike two, three, and four, but I STILL wanted this thing to work! So I watched the rest of the movie with my fingers crossed...    But all I can say is I feel bad for John Hurt being stuck in this stinker. I'm sure he got enough money to make it all worth while though...
0307588335|5.0|Lawrence McDonald A Colossal Failure of Common Sense is an extraordinary book. What if he wrote it while it was happening? Could that have changed the dire consequences to our spirit of living and our economy as a nation, as a people, as families?

B00008BXJ6|3.0|This album is o.k., but I like the current lead singer more than the original.  This album is sort of a historical look at the beginnings of AC/DC.  There are always those who like the original and I understand that, as I usually do myself, but this is an exception for me.  If you prefer the \\"original\\" thing, you would probably like this album a lot.  By the way, is that bolt of lightning a phallic symbol or what?  I think the guitar works much better in that role here, but the producers seem to want a double whammy of it on this cover.      I love the guitar work of Angus, but I can tell he has gotten better with time, kinda like a good, cheap bottle of wine.  I give this album a 7 on a scale of 10 if that helps.

B001HN69AY|5.0|Dr. Parnassus had made a deal with the devil.  Many deals actually.  He's spent a lifetime making them as it's the devil's favorite pastime, making bets with Dr. Parnassus.  The Doctor's got plenty of time to make bets / deals with the devil given that one of them included the good doctor becoming immortal.  But of course when you play such games, eventually you'll get burned.  And that is what this movie is about.<br /><br />Dr. Parnassus and his traveling side show (which consists of the doctor, Valentina - the doctor's daughter, Anton - the young man who loves Valentina, and Percy - the doctor's sidekick) is being followed by Mr. Nick (the devil) as time is just about up on one very particular debt.  Oh, and they find a man hanging by a noose from a bridge, nearly dead, unable to remember a thing.  Is he connected to Mr. Nick?  Will the doctor bother telling his daughter how she plays into this deal?  Can the doctor win?  Does the devil even want to win or does he actually enjoy losing to the doctor? How does the doctor's mirror play into all of this?  Does Tony (the hanging man) really forget who he is or is he playing them all for fools?  They have a lot to deal with and a short time to face it all.<br /><br />It's a fun fantasy.  Visually stunning.  Yes Heath Ledger died during the filming of this movie.  It's a tragedy we're all aware of.  I went into this movie knowing of that, but not knowing just how much or little of his role he'd finished, only knowing that other actors stepped up to fill the void.  Obviously we'd all prefer that he'd been around to finish this and many more films, but, the way they completed the role actually worked out rather well and he's actually in more of the film than I was expecting.  Very well done.<br /><br />I'm giving this one the benefit of the doubt at 5 stars as I did love it.  It's probably more the 4 3/4 stars as the story could have been tightened up just a wee bit here and there.  But compared to a lot of what is out there nowadays it's so much more deserving of the 5.  In fact in this day and age where it feels like virtually every other movie centers around an animated talking dog, I'm really surprised that this wasn't promoted more than it was.much more deserving of the 5.

B000OVLBFS|4.0|THANK YOU for checking out my reviews. I recently have been looking into Tom Selleck's catalog of projects and have been pleased with the results. I am not a reader of the JS book series, so I had no idea what to expect. But after recently watching a Jesse Stone feature on CBC in 2009, I realized this was a series, and decided to go back and explore this product from the beginning. While 'NIGHT PASSAGE' is described as the official 'prequel' to the first JS movie and sets everything up (and is really a LOUSY title, so DON'T be deceived!), it wastes no time in pulling viewers into the characters world. Excellent production values, beautiful photography and exceptional acting compensate for what seem to be standard crime-noir thrillers where only slight surprises occur. The casts and characters in these stories seem to be limited, so by the end, it isn't too hard to figure out where the story is headed. But expect a small surprise or two with each chapter, as well as finely detailed character development and dialogue. Tom Selleck does an excellent SLOW BURN characterization here - unlike anything he's done so far in his varied career. The JESSE STONE series looks to be an exception adult modern-day alternative to the classic detective films of the 1940's and 1950's. They are the perfect compliment to a busy week, and make thoroughly entertaining viewing on a quiet Sunday afternoon or evening. Intelligent, thoughtful, moody and at times dryly funny, TOM SELLECK SCORES with this unique series. And at only $10. a title (sometimes even LESS!) these are great additions to your home DVD series.
0525423842|4.0|I almost put this book down, with disapointment.  The first 111 pages were boring and I really wondered where John Grisham was going with this story.  But, John Grisham, had a plan and the next 152 pages were interesting and told of quite a tale.  Young Theo is an interesting kid and got involved in a very \\"well done\\" murder.  The defendant, Pete Duffy was pretty confident that no one observed him do his dirty deed, but this was not the case. Duffy was almost to the point of aquittal, but Theo, his uncle and the parents; along with the Honorable Judge Gantry came up with an alternative.  So, what I initially thought was a work for the juvenile reader, ended up being a pretty good story line.

B001N26GFM|5.0|So far, I've only viewed this riveting film twice.But it doesn't take too many viewings to evoke much commentary on this memorable historical drama.    Based on the book of the same name by John Boyne, it deals with the story of young Bruno (whose wide-blue-eyed innocence is played outstandingly by young Asa Butterfield), the eight-year-old son of a member of the German High Command (David Thewlis)in World War II Berlin.   We meet Bruno and his family as they learn they are to move to Poland due to the promotion of Bruno's father.The young boy frolics with his friends in the streets, oblivious to people being rounded up and herded into cattle cars around them. His beautiful, amiable mother(Vera Farmiga) arrives home from an outing, while his sister, Gretl(Amber Beattie) plays with dolls in her room.   The children of priviledge soon present themselves downstairs at a party celebrating their father's promotion. In contrast to their grandfather's (Richard Johnson) support of the Third Reich, their grandmother's (Sheila Hancock) apprehension about its policies is noted on this occasion.   Once in Poland, Bruno finds himself without any friends, and forbidden to explore certain parts of the new residence.    Soon, he sneaks out anyway, and encounters the mysterious \\"farm\\" he was able to see from his bedroom window before it was boarded up.    He encounters a young boy in striped pajamas named Schmuel(Jack Scanlon)and begins to converse with him, gradually beginning to empathize with his plight.    At home, he sees the Nazi Lieutenant Kotler(Rupert Friend), amusing his sister, and brutalizing a Jewish servant named Pavel (David Hayman, who was previously in another WWII flick, \\"Hope and Glory\\"), and is curious as to why no one objects to this behavior.    Over time, as they receive the standard indoctrination from their tutor, Herr  Liszt (Jim Norton), and Gretel becomes a hard-core little Bundist, forsaking her dolls and assuming what she considers to be more appropriate duties in the wake of the Fatherland's plight, while her brother, who seems to have his mother's gentler nature, is more reluctant to accept indoctrination.    He still visits Schmuel at the edge of the fence whenever possible, occasionally taking him food, passing him his soccer ball, or indulging in a game of checkers, allowing the incarcerated lad to call the moves from his side of the fence.The joy and innocence of these two boys shines amid the horror.    A bombing claims the life of Bruno's ailing grandmother, and Bruno discusses her funeral with his friend.    There is an unfortunate moment of betrayal when the sadistic Lieutenant Kotler, perhaps striving to prove his loyalty to the Reich, especially when it becomes known that his father does not support it, catches the two boys together, as Schmuel(who has replaced the murdered Pavel) was cleaning glassware in Bruno's house, and Bruno denies having given Schmuel the sweets he was caught with.   But Bruno will find a way to reconcile with his friend, in a devastatingly heroic  way that reveals his parents' ultimate failure to shield him from the goings-on, and reveals how terrible poetic justice can be.The last scene of two boys together is one of them clinging to each other among a forest of emaciated adults, looking upward with still-wide-eyed innocence, still believing in the best...   While there have been complaints about historical accuracy, this is a tale of painful sweetness with a tug at the heartstrings that has the strength of a child's pull, and a reminder of how we may condemn those we love the best with our own hatreds.

However, it is simply 3 different levels of workouts that you are supposed to change yourself when you feel you are ready to move on.  If she was going to do it that way, she should have done 4 so you have a different work out each week at least.  It's typical Jillian style of she shows you then walks around to the other people doing the exercises.  Generally it is a good DVD to fill in the holes of going to the gym, but I'm not sure if I would say this is going to get you in shape in 30 days since you may get bored before the end of the month.
1563890119|5.0|The Sandman was a series I stumbled upon due to my liking of Neil Gaiman's other worksuch as American Gods and Coraline. The fact that it was a Comic Book series made it all the more appealing. Let me say that if you're at all in love with the DC universe, Neil Gaiman, or even just the idea of dreams, and other realities, THIS IS THE SERIES FOR YOU.     Volume One introduces the main character who goes by many names, one of which is the series title. You are introduced to the idea of beings known as the Endless, siblings of sorts, 2 of which being our main character and his sister Death. Also, that they exist in between the different religious mythologies, dimensions, universes, etc. From visiting the justice league, to the depths of Hell, to the office of John Constantine, this first volume familiarizes you with the bizarre, yet intriguing worlds, plots, characters, and so much more.    If you find yourself interested in the first title, PRELUDES & NOCTURNES is just the beginning. The is a great start to an amazing series that all must enjoy!
B001UJSW7S|4.0|Potential buyers should at least be alerted to two features of the opera, which is not really like what you would expect from the usual comments about cross between Strauss and Puccini. It would be more appropriate to say: a cross between Lehar and Puccini, with a bit of Alban Berg thrown in. The story line is woefully idiotic, but most of the music is rich and colourful, not to say overripe and opulent. Frankly the \\"Lehar\\" episodes drive me mad, they stick out like a sore thumb, whereas \\"Berg\\" fits in perfectly.  Leinsdorf, who normally tends to be somewhat cut and dried, here adopts an almost opposite stance. The result is an extraordinarily lavish orchestral canvas. One could easily come to the belief that he loves Korngold's score more than any other. The sound, despite its age, is translucent, all the details of this rich score comes through. So no complaints in this department. Listeners accustomed to digital might find a little constricted, but one gets used to it quickly.  The cast is variable. René Kollo gives a good protrayal, as he should, having been a pop singer before he turned to opera. His voice is not especially agile, and he has no genuine top. It is not a performance that would thrill you, and he has a habit (also discernible in his Wagner roles, where they sound utterly inappropriate) of degenerating into vaudeville. Mind you, the plot invites this kind of thing. In contrast, the mellow baritone of Hermann Prey caresses the ear with its mellifluous tones. Unfortunately he only has one 'song', a kind of circus ballade, and Frank Sinatra would have done it just as well. Benjamin Luxon's role is mostly sing-song speaking, so there isn't much to say; whjereas Rose wagemann has a deep alto voice that seems ideal for the lines she has to sing. Her's is in fact the first really singing voice we hear, and she makes a good start to proceedings.  This leaves us with the heroine. Well, she ain't no Maritza! Still, as long as she sings in her natural register, she produces some lovely tones. Rising up into higher regions, her voice gets pinched. Not ideal.  As far as I know, this is the only recording of the work in modern stereo. It is, from a singing point of view, less than perfect. I could imagine Jessye Norman thrilling me where Nesbitt has me worried if she's going to make it. I think Nicolai Gedda would have thrilled me as the hero, while Kollo leaves me cold. So the real hero of this recording is Leinsdorf. I can't imagine another conductor with so much flair of the Viennese kind - committed, but not overly serious, and revelling in the glories of the orchestral writing.  Finally, a word of praise for Charles Gerhardt, whose production is stylish, but discreet. How easy it would been to exaggerate the effects.  So in all, if you can cope with a story that's sillier than even the proverbial silly opera plot, there is plenty of well-performed, beautiful music to enjoy.
B000002BFL|4.0|I think this was the greatest Bruce Springsting album.  The message of the songs and descriptions of what some people go through on this album help people understand the things which are wrong with our culture, thinking, and government.  The only down side is that I can't understand the lyrics well enough without reading the lyrics off of a sheet which I got off the internet!  However, my ears are not that great, so for people without really good ears, hearing the lyrics clearly might be a problem.
B0032JTV6U|1.0|Knowing that \\"Road to Regionals\\" (season finale for season 1) will be aired next week, I went on-line to find the release date of Glee Season 1 Vol. 2.  Imagine my  disgust when I found out that there will be no Season 1 Vol 2 release, but that Gleeks were expected to buy the 1st 13 episodes all over again just for the privilage to get the remaining 9 episodes!  Well, not for me!  I refuse to give into studio greed by re-purchasing something that I already own 60% off.  If worse comes to worse, I will wait until I find the item used and buy it from a second party so that 20th Century Fox gets NOTHING from me!!!!  In addition, I will minimize spending my money on all DVD and movie tickets for FOX films and I urge other fans to do the same.  The fans must ban together to stop corporate greed.  I hope that Amazon has the courage to print this review since I buy over 100 items a year from this website.
B000001IPL|5.0|This is one of the most badass albums ever pressed to vinyl/cd/tape etc. I still find myself loading a surprise \\"KILLBOY POWERHEAD\\" or, well.. just about anything from this album onto my ipod. It's great running music, it's mood lifting and pure energy. It's raw, though... it's loud and it doesn't stop and it will roll you over. This be no easy listening. I love it. Always will. This was the first cd I ever owned and I couldn't have picked better.
B00003CWPL|1.0|I had to force myself to finish this movie. I watch a movie for a story and to be entertained. Period. I'm not a film critic or a psychologist.  While I watched this movie I figured that somewhere along the line, something had to make sense. It didn't.  Besides, just because a movie is obscure, strange, whatever, doesn't make it deep!    I watched it on Netflicks (instant on Roku), so at least I didn't waste money on it.    Actually, I've had more interesting nightmares!!   Humm.......maybe I should make a movie.    And, I've never seen so many, \\"open-minded\\",\\"deep-thinking\\" adults(?) incapable of accepting difference of opinion. Grow up guys, its just a movie.      A 1977 review of Eraserhead by Variety called it a \\"sickening bad-taste exercise\\" which \\"pulls out all gory stops in the unwatchable climax....the mind boggles to learn that Lynch labored on this pic for five years
B003MC5N28|3.0|This book was part of my 8th grade reading list, and I must say I was shocked. Whatever message the book conveyed, it frankly freaked me out. I do not reccommend it for the emotionally unready.
0307454541|5.0|You should read the first two books of the trilogy before getting into this one, but they are all compelling reading.  The character of Salander is unforgettable.  I waited impatiently for this one to come out and could not put it down once I got it.  A really great read.

0439023483|5.0|The Game of Hunger       This action-packed book by Suzanne Collins has a lot of violence.  The Hunger Game is fiction, but there is some truth to all the violence. The North American government of Panama makes twenty four randomly selected children kill each other on the battlefield. This cruel government is doing this to remind its citizens not to rebel. Katniss, a 16 year old girl that volunteered for the games to make sure her 12 year old sister does not have to fight, shows true quick-wittedness and bravery on the battlefield.  Katniss has to kill the twenty-three other teenagers, or be killed herself.      During battle, love blossoms between Katniss and another contestant named Peeta. It is hard for them to connect emotionally, because Katniss likes another person back home named Gale with whom she hunts. Katniss feels guilty about the relationship, because at first she pretends to love Peeta only to win favor from the crowd which would help her in battle. Although her love was false at the beginning, she grew to genuinely like Peeta. Katniss knew that Gale would be watching, and she could never really decide who she liked best.      The book is intense and it grabbed my attention from the start. It is a great book that has twists and turns throughout. The government gives advantages to certain people and tries to eliminate the love between Katniss and Peeta.  This book is quite exciting.  It is gut-wrenching, incredibly entertaining, and a book that everyone should read.     -Patrick Kurzner
B00006CXSS|5.0|Ive always watched war films, they've always been my favorite. out of all the wwII films ive seen this one just blasted them all away. the most realistic captivating series i will ever watch and the same for pacific as soon as i watch that one because i know its going to be a great as this one. dont double take on this series get it now and watch it all in one run if you can, i made sure i did because i knew i wasnt going to be able to take my eyes off it.

B0002NRRAG|4.0|Madeleine has a beautiful voice.  It makes me think of the old classic singers like Ella and Billie.  I do wish, though, that she'd bring her own style to some of the old classics from the American Songbook.  Sure they've been recorded a number of times, but I would love to hear what they sound like with Madeleine's voice.
B0026OE2O8|5.0|This is a documentary well worth viewing. The photography is stunning in its beauty and message, and everyone who lives on our planet should watch this. Highly recommend!
0312330537|4.0|I borrowed this book from a friend.  It was only the first 300 pages because she was enjoying it so much, she tore it in half so her husband could get started reading while she finished it.  I got so engrossed in the first half, I did an online search on Amazon.com to find an intact copy.  I was excited and into the characters, the days could not go by fast enough for me.  My used issue arrived in excellent  condition, and the adventures in Bombay continued.  I must tell you that Gregory Roberts does an exceptional job of capturing Bombay.  The character development is good as are his accents and idioms.  My disappointment in this book comes toward the end when the main character travels out of India.  Without giving away the story line, let me just share that there is a good deal of death and gruesome scenes described.  Not for the faint of heart. I understand that Roberts has written a sequel.  I just may have to revisit Bombay again soon.
030745455X|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It would be best to read the trilogy in sequence as the characters and their relationships become more involved and the clues and revelations more intriguing.  I wish there were more about Lisbeth. She was unique.
B0026LYM5U|5.0|I have been a fan of The Gathering for many years and I consider Anneke van Giersbergen to be a personal hero to me. She is hugely inspiring and I was quite despondent when I heard she had parted from The Gathering. However, 'The West Pole' has been a wonderful addition to my collection and I've been listening to it regularly since it came out. The sound reminds me more of earlier songs, such as 'Frail', and is overall very mellow.     Silje Wergeland sounds like an angel. Her voice is smooth and very legato, floating gently and with ease. Does she compare to Anneke? I think so. She hasn't proven herself to be anywhere near as dynamic and powerful, but she does have a beautiful, unique voice that I admire.    I enjoy every song on this release, but here are my top 5:    1. 'Capital of Nowhere' - This is the song I listen to absolutely the most, but is also one that I didn't like at first. It sounds almost like she is singing predominately in head voice throughout the track which is something that had to grow on me. It so did, though, and the instrumental bit at the end reminds me very much of older Gathering songs ('Confusion').    2. 'The West Pole' - The title track was the first song of the album that I listened to and it was a very promising introduction. It is slow to moderately paced and very beautiful. It is one of the catchier songs, in my opinion, so if you're just starting to get a feel for this new release, I would recommend listening to 'The West Pole' as one of your first.    3. 'You Promised Me a Symphony' - A gentle piano melody accompanying very sad, gently spoken lyrics. This song is a bit heartbreaking and bitter, and I was very attracted to its honesty. 'You Promised Me a Symphony' is in 3/4 time and is a bit different from the other tracks on the CD. Definitely a winner for someone who is a fan of slow, sad piano-predominant songs.    4. 'No Bird Call' - It takes a while to get started and is very slow, but is also very interesting and beautiful.I LOVE the end of this track, \\"She had it all...\\", backed by beautiful strings and vocal harmonies.    5. 'No One Spoke' - My favorite upbeat song on the album! If you're looking for a faster, more commercial introduction to the CD, I recommend this song.     Again, I enjoy every song on this CD. Is it for everyone? Probably not. This release isn't very commercial and, in my opinion, would probably appeal more to fans of more down-tempo music. Is it for me? Definitely. I hope this review is useful to you, as I don't typically write them, but I felt 'The West Pole' needed more positive words spoken about it.
B00005JKED|4.0|There is no denying that `Training Day' is remarkably entertaining and wholly engaging from start to finish.  In fact, this is one of those films that leaves the viewer with baited breath, constantly wrapping us around its tightly woven finger to keep us engaged and engrossed, thoroughly.<br /><br />That said, this is not a film that ages remarkably well.  Yes, it remains entertaining and exciting, but upon reflection it becomes easy to point out the flaws.<br /><br />It isn't as smart as I remembered it being.<br /><br />Still, there is little not to like about this film.  Yes, it is violent and littered with profanities, but if you know anything about this movie then you should know what you are walking into and so you really have no room to complain about those things.  This is a gritty cop movie filled with drugs and gangsters and death; and the trailer alone kind of made that evident.<br /><br />The film follows a rookie cop named Jake as he gets a taste of the job from his new partner, Alonzo Harris.  Alonzo is a rough and tumble cop who is apparently crooked.  The job has hardened him, making him ruthless and corruptible.  Jake has not yet been manipulated by his profession.  He is still green and his naivety makes him an easy (allegedly) target for Alonzo's games.  As their day together escalates, things happen that set off a series of alarms in Jake's head.  This is not going to be your typical day on the job.  As the day draws to a close it becomes apparent that Alonzo has had a lot more than just work on his mind, and soon violence spreads like a plague over this newfound, explosive partnership.<br /><br />For me, this film is intensely edited and directed to capture your interest and hold it firmly in its grip.  Each scene is manipulated in a way to keep us glued.  This is a blessing, but upon reflection it also seems like a curse.  The film dissolves into nothing more than a series of scenes; no real moving plot just exciting moments strung together.  When it does try to form a plot it winds up becoming a tad too far fetched for its own good.  It works solely because of the pacing and the performances.  If left on its own right the film would have fallen apart.<br /><br />Those performances (or the two that matter) are beautifully compatible.  For me, this is easily Ethan Hawkes movie.  So much love and flattery has been showered on Denzel Washington for his performance here, but that is only because it is flashy and baity.  Honestly, Hawke had the harder character to formulate, someone who is suppressed in his own convictions as he observes and reacts to the outlandish behavior of someone he cannot trust yet needs to in order to survive.  He has to make his subtle performance equal Washington's flamboyant one or else he suffers becoming overshadowed and thus forgotten.  I'm so glad he got the Oscar nomination, even if it was in the wrong category (how in the world was he supporting?).  Denzel is very good here, if not a tad over the top.  He nails a lot of scenes (the introduction scene in the diner is still one of my favorite moments in film this entire decade) but he also goes overboard a few times.  He runs that fine line between intense and hammy.<br /><br />Hawke wins.<br /><br />In the end I give this a solid B+.  I still think that the script is the films weakest link.  It has a nice contrast of morality at play here, and it had the potential to really tap into that concept (and it does to a degree) but the overall plot just doesn't stand up on its own.  It works far better as a concept than an actual story.  That said, the fresh take on direction and the solid performances make this a must see film, and one that you will surely enjoy.nds up becoming a tad too far fetched for its own good.

1416594787|5.0|Fantastic book.  Dawkins gives ample explanation for each example throughout the book.      Regardless of the reader's knowledge of the sciences, the book is an easy and enjoyable read.  It also happens to be quite witty in regards to poking fun at Creationists.  It is not harsh by any means, but Dawkins easily conveys how evolution occurred, and is still occurring as long as life persists on Earth.    For what it's worth, I'm a Microbiology major and finishing up my Bachelors.  This book is perfect for those-- as Dawkins put it more ornately-- who believe in evolution, but do not know enough to defend it, those who are curious-- but unsure-- about evolution, and for people who simply do not believe in evolution all together.    Though Dawkins is a staunch Atheist, this book does not come off as an anti-religious work.  Dawkins himself even provides the names of a few very prominent men-of-cloth who believe every word of Evolution.
B001HN694K|1.0|\\"Alice\\" fails in so many ways, not the least of which is Burton's uncreative reliance on computer-generated EVERYTHING. Beyond that, the character development is shoddy as hell and the whole thing just feels like a poor attempt at using names and star-status to get people to see it.    Sure, Jonny Depp is great as always and Helena Bonham-Carter is funny, but as a story, it left me feeling very unfulfilled.     You might as well go see another frikkin' \\"Shrek\\" movie, 'cuz this is just as soulless, but particularly disappointing because this man made \\"Beetlejuice.\\"     Where did Tim Burton's ability to truly haunt us with his visionary skills go?    Check out \\"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\\" instead. It may not rape your eyeballs like \\"Avatar,\\" but it's definitely more grounded in a tangible fantasy world, one that speaks to something deeper than candy.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|This movie is among the best for 2009.  It should have received more attention.
030726999X|5.0|This stunning book is the last of a trilogy centered on revenge. The heroine is a sort of hippie superwoman bent on avenging the wounds done her by men all of her life. Like a super character she can \\"see\\" through things in cyber space, she has super strength and speed. She fights the evil done to women by men and men's governments. She's astounding, as is this trilogy.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|i had heard of this book back in school... i am 27 yrs old now and read it for the 1st time and let me say i have no idea how i let this book slip for so long. it a wonderful story and i will always remember it.  it a must read for all girls of any age. so glad i finally read it. would give more than 5 stars if i could.

B001LYD2JU|5.0|Man what an exciting time the early 1980's were for heavy metal! New bands, old bands, solo acts with metal veterans were all plying their trade with similar power and success that made this era really a golden age for heavy rock. No hard rock musician had a more sensational debut than Michael Schenker in the summer of 1980. No one questioned Michael's talent, only his temperament and in the beginning the latter never overshadowed the former.  It must have been bitter sweet for UFO fans that not only had Schenker's debut to salivate over but also the vastly underrated `No Place to Run' record by Mogg, Way and company. This was almost the same situation as the Sabbath/Ozzy parallel without the hype or commercial success but with equally artistic triumphs.   Michael's solo debut, produced by Roger Glover is littered with great hard rock songs and nothing he would do later would surpass his initial effort though `MSG' his second, comes closet. Michael worked with mostly session musicians here including the incomparable Simon Philips, rock vet Don Airey and new comer Gary Barden, who would form a more lasting working relationship with the mercurial guitarist. Favorites are without a doubt opener \\"Armed and Ready\\" which instantly became one of my all-timers. \\"Lost Horizons\\", \\"Cry for the Nations\\" and \\"Victim of Illusion\\" rivals anything from his UFO days. \\"Horizons\\" is an epic; Michael's \\"Stargazer\\" or \\"Kashmir\\" is just has that something that makes it a classic hard rock masterpiece. \\"Into the Arena\\" became Michael's show stopping solo piece although it is a true song with all musicians turning in top notch performances.  Anybody who has the vaguest interest in the Mad Axeman, the blond demon with the Gibson Flying V then they need to get the initial release from the ill-fated Michael Schenker Group; an album that belongs with all the greats from the magical year of 1980...I need you now like I never did before...

B001OQCV2E|5.0|My PERSONAL opinion of this movie is that it is great entertainment.  I do not go for the scientific accuracy of a movie but the plausibility and entertainment factor.

Great addition to my movie library.
0553381695|5.0|With over 600 reviews at the time of my writing this, there is not a whole lot more to say. However, I just wanted to share my take on this marvelous book. This novel is one of the greatest sequel books I have ever read and should be regarded highly just in that regard itself. I almost think of it as a combination of many storylines that could have had entire novels just for themselves. The characters are what make it so superb. They become entire stories within themselves and you can't help but compare them and see how they have grown and changed from the first book. If you are considering this book and have read \\"A Game of Thrones\\" - go for it. This book continues the rich, gratifying world that you have grown to love and expands on it. This book does not move at the same feverish pace as the first book, but that actually lends to its appeal. Every action is a methodical plot point that may seem slow, but helps to build towards a gradual crescendo that was truly epic in every sense of the word.    On a side note, I hate to be negative, but I have not heard good things about further novels in the series after this one. I say enjoy \\"A Clash of Kings\\" for what it is - a fantastic fantasy novel. Enjoy it!
B002VECM6S|5.0|I bought this movie for my daughter for her birthday.  I really didn't think I wanted to watch it, I thought \\"Oh boy, a football movie\\".  I do not care for football!

B002ZFQD0E|5.0|The ArchAndroid is totaly mesmerizing. \\"A pychedelic love ride through life & times\\" It has beautiful orchestral themes that float you through past memories of yesterday, reminders of today & hopes for tomorrow. Walt Disney mixed with The King Of Pop, Santana, Hendrix, Stevie Wonder, Movies, Broadway, James Brown & everything else inbetween. A masterpiece of great depth and imagination. I love the basslines; they remind me of the 70's and it flows like a movie on a cd. This concept reminds me of Michael Jackson's visionary abilities. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Judging from this installment of the story they're telling, i'm quite sure the continuing sequel will be a mindblower! A CD BLOCKBUSTER! I haven't listened to anything else since it was released on the 18th of May.There hasn't been fulfilling music like this in a long long time! I hope everyone picks up on this cd and elevate it past all the rump shaking music that's out there today so the whole world can hear, feel and bask in its brilliance.  Here's to following the beat of your OWN drum...........fearless!
B00275EHIW|4.0|Ah, lovely Persia, circa something BC. A land of graceful minarets, beautiful landscapes and a dagger that controls the fate of humanity. Yes, kids, it's time of year again: time for the summer popcorn action movies!    This particular one is an adaptation of the popular video game series, Prince of Persia. Now I've not played it, and haven't any real desire to start (I'm still trying to finish Assassin's Creed II), but if this movie is anything to go by it looks like it's probably fairly decent.    The film centers around an orphan boy, Dastan (played as an adult by Jake Gyllenhaal, a man who has never been introduced to a close shave). He gets adopted by the king of what appears to be an alternate history version of Persia. I'll have to write an article on my blog that goes into more detail on that and my guesses on how such a timeline came about. No life, you see. Anyhow, Dastan goes to the palace and gets raised by the king along with his two new brothers. Also present is the king's brother, played by Ben Kingsley in a role so telegraphed he might as well have had \\"I'm a scheming vizier!\\" tattooed onto his forehead.    Anyhow, the good prince gets caught up in an invasion of a holy city that appears to be at least somewhat Jewish in its holiness, but not quite. More on this later. Suffice to say that the invasion (staged on the pretext of finding weapons factories, as I roll my eyes), is a success, more or less, though in the after party the king is killed, Dastan is framed for his death, goes on the run with a princess/priestess from the city and is now carrying a magical dagger that can turn back time in 30 second intervals.    From there he goes on a nice travelogue of places that are apparently right near the city all the action has been happening in. He meets a man who races ostriches (played with manic glee by Alfred Molina), his knife-throwing Sudanese henchman, several assassins and, of course, develops an attraction to the woman he's on the run with (weknow in advance this will happen because she clearly hates him on first sight).    The plot is pretty basic, predictable and paint-by-numbers but somewhat to my surprise I didn't hate it. I liked this movie, actually, quite a bit more than I'd expected that I would. Its action scenes are decent, the dialogue is humorous when it needs to be, everyone involved seemed to be having a good time and it had a nice level of energy, though it did drag a bit in the second and third acts.    Overall if you want basic escapism, this is a good movie to escape with. It's hardly great cinema, but it doesn't need to be, really. It is what it is and what it is is pretty decent.

0451205766|4.0|I found a copy in an old box of books in the garage.  I had seen the movies prior to reading the book and was in the mood for reading a \\"classic.\\"  In spite of the fact that I was already aware of the plot twists to come, I really enjoyed the read.  At times, I found myself daydreaming or bogged down with the book's small details.  But overall, I enjoyed the excellent character development.  The book offers more insight into the Godfather, how he came to be, and into his crime family.  By the end, I felt like I knew the \\"Godfather\\" and his family. It was an interesting, although sometimes arduous read.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|This was the perfect way to cap off five seasons of the best Television we have ever been given. The first five seasons were great in their own right, and Season 6 does not disappoint. There are a fair amount of people out there complaining about unanswered mysteries and questions, but I would challenge any of those people to name one unanswered question that dealt in any way with the central story line of the show. The genius of Lost lies in the writers' ability to draw the audience in to the flawed lives of the characters in a remarkably intriguing way. In this sixth and final season, the writers used a brand new storytelling device. We have seen flashes to the past and the future before, but now we are introduced to a Flash Sideways. Great way of intriguing the viewer, and also somewhat confusing. It keeps the viewer off balance between the Flash Sideways and the Island's story which plays out in very satisfying fashion. The Dynamic between the characters is at an all time high. Terry O'Quinn and Matthew Fox are absolutely fantastic throughout the season. Michael Emerson has moments where he would be a hands down favorite for the Emmy if it weren't for O'Quinn. Nestor Carbonell gets more screentime than ever and he takes it a long way. The Stories regarding the Island are resolved very well. The thing about watching LOST is that you are going to have to use your brain. The Writers are absolutely not spelling anything out for the Audience even here in Season 6. The one time it actually does happen, it comes off a little too blatant. That is what makes LOST the show it is. The characters play out their story and concern themselves with the questions important to their overall goal. Those questions are answered very well, and most every other is answered enough for the audience to deduce the rest for themselves. Best television show in history, and absolutely perfect way to end it.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|Upon arrival, the set seemed perfect- Great display case, hours of Star Trek- The perfect gift for my best friend. Unfortunatly, the set I got her was not all star trek- the thrid disc starts playing the first episode and then all of a sudden... it switches to an episode of NCIS! Needless to say, this is one of the most dissappointing items I've ever purchased online. :( Although, in all fairness to Amazon, the copy I selected was from another user. Neverthe less, it was a huge let down to know that I spent so much on a bootleg.
B001NTNJL4|5.0|A MUST have cd....definitive of the early 90s    Hey, just saw/found a new- VERY different Gary Cherone tune online- its called \\"Comin' To Get You\\"- Gary Cherone with some band called Anklelock (sp?) I believe....its REALLY good! Just downloaded it....pretty heavy/aggressive, and not what I would have expected, but real decent.
B001HN694K|3.0|I have to admit that I did like this freakish thing for what it was. The idea of taking classic tales and expanding on them almost never goes well, and in the long run I think that's how this movie will be remembered if it's remembered at all.<br /><br />It was an interesting story, and not at all the rip off of BBC's Alice that I expected it to be. The writing was adequate as was the camera work...sort of.<br /><br />Alice (Mia Wasikowska) does a great job considering what she had to work with. And by \\"what she had to work with\\" I mean Johnny Depp. Not that Depp isn't a good actor, he is. And not that Depp doesn't play some weirdos, he does. The problem with Depp's character is his appearance--which is so over the top that the only thing I could think of when he was on screen was \\"oh my gawd, Willy Wonka exploded and then Walt Disney threw up on him.\\"-- was almost painful to watch. Really, it's so bad it's distracting.<br /><br />The Hooka smoking bug was interesting, even well done I suppose. And considering Carrol's original has all of the aspects of an LSD induced trip I suppose this caterpillar was in keeping with the doped up spirit of the book.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that the door-mouse didn't tell Alice to \\"feed her head,\\" but that's a minor thing as well.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with the movie wasn't in the writing at all. even if you can get forgive the Johnny Depp--Mad Hatter psychedelic demon thing in the movie I don't know how anyone can forgive Hollywood for taking Ann Hathaway--who is one of the best looking women in the movies not to mention a great actress--and making her look like some sort of Frankenstein/post operative transvestite hybrid who wanders around looking like the lobotomy has been successful. Such a hideous transformation of this great actress is  something that clearly cannot be forgiven, ever.<br /><br />If you buy this movie invest on one of those TV Bricks...you know the bricks that are made out of the Nerf material so that you can safely throw them at your TV in anger.w them at your TV in anger.
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|I'm trying, really I am. I'm only 1/5th of the way through this book and I have put up with a primer on all of modern scandinavian politics (yawn) and super bureaucrat Gullberg should know enough at the ripe old age of 78 to just shoot Zalachenko! I loved the first two books but maybe Larsson died before tightening this book up??? I will review again when I'm done. I never review before I'm finished but this book is as cold as a winter in stockholm. I know, I know that without the big bad Russian there is no plot forward. Really, though, who believes that Gullberg wouldn't just shoot Zalachenko to get out of all these tedious meetings?
030726999X|5.0|Everybody doesn't like strawberry ice cream. What does this have to do with a book review? Well, apparently everybody doesn't like this trilogy, but those of us who do are reading and raving. It is a joy to find not just one book, but three in a row, which are so well written, cleverly plotted, contain unusual and unforgetable characters. I simply could not put any one of the three books down and let everything else be put aside as I read on. I was so sorry to finish Hornet's Nest that I am in the process of re-reading all three again. I review a lot of books, yet I am at a loss to explain the appeal these three thriller have for me. It sounds trite to say they are really good. And they are so refreshing in a sea of many-published waste of trees. I can't praise the trilogy enough because they are the best three books I have read in a very long time. I highly recommend them to all who enjoy thrillers and a good read. I would recommend they be read in order so that the entire story can be appreciated. What a sad thing that Larsson can no longer contribute to our enjoyment, but how fine it is to have these three books.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke is classic in its approach of man's influence on his surroundings. It tells the story of an honorable prince who's been outcast and tries to bring peace between the worlds of man and nature.
B00004RJ74|5.0|If you are into completely gratuitous non-stop violence, then this movie is certainly for your.  If you deplore graphic murder, mayhem, blood, gore and more of the same...over and over and over again, then you probably won't like the film very much.  But wait!  Let me finish...<br /><br />As long as you realize and accept the fact that, as another reviewer has so well stated in his review, that this is purely an exploitation movie, and if you watch it purely for the fun of seeing vampires ripped to shreds; dismembered in oh so many creative ways, along with regular human type people too, then this movie is about as good as it gets.<br /><br />Now you are talking to a guy who just barely made it through Hostel 1 and Saw 1 and has absolutely no intention of seeing their many sequels.  That sort of movie simply does not appeal to me what so ever and as a matter of fact I was personally rather sickened by them; indeed, I was actually offended by them.<br /><br />This movie is a bit different though.  It is almost like two movies in one.  The first half of the film consists of two brothers, one completely psychopathic, and the other, played by George Clooney, just on the edge of complete madness, racing across country spreading violence at every turn.  This part of the movie I did not much care for.  The second half of the movie goes into the realm of fantasy when they kidnap a father and his two children and take their travel trailer to a bar in Mexico to met some other bad guys.<br /><br />Here the tale changes and it is an all out battle between a large band of very violent and vicious vampires.  Will they last the night?  Who is more violent, the vampires or the Clooney crew?<br /><br />This movie actually has some very good actors featured.  There is of course George Clooney who I loved watching in [[ASIN:B00003CXRM O Brother, Where Art Thou?]] and then we have Harvey Keitel, one of my favorite character actors.  Juliette Lewis plays the young daughter and she plays her part perfectly in almost the same mode she played the part of Adele Corners in [[ASIN:0792846435 Kalifornia]]...she was made for these two parts.  Cheech Marin is also featured and is as funny and as....well, `Cheech' as you can get...always a delight.  As an added feature, Salma Kayek, who is not at all hard on the eyes, does what could have been a very cheesy pole dance with a large white snake and actually pulls it off, actually making the entire sordid dance routine quite sensual...to say the least.<br /><br />Ah, and then there is the camera work...the morphing from really scummy humans to really scummy vampires.  This was all done quite well.<br /><br />Is this a great film?  No my friends it is not.  It is an absolute piece of crap.  But that being said, it is a very fun piece of crap to watch.  Just enjoy it for what it is.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarkse mode she played the part of Adele Corners in [[ASIN:0792846435 Kalifornia]]...she was made for these two parts.

B0000640SB|3.0|Well, after several years of flicking through the HBO stations and spotting Men In Black (because it never seemed like a particularly appealing movie to me so I never felt inclined to watch it) I finally gave it a chance yesterday afternoon.      I was actually forced into watching Men In Black with my dad because it was extremely hot outside, and there was nothing else to do.    It's not a *bad* film by any means.  It's just a really silly movie that mostly feels like it's intended for children.  In fact, my impression is that not even teenagers would enjoy this kind of movie.      Everything from Will Smith's character battling aliens, to helping a woman give birth to a squid creature, to one of the characters basically acting like a zombie and running around the city destroying everything in sight... the entire plot feels severely childish to me.      Worst movie I've ever seen?  No, far from it.  It's just not *that* great.      Oh, and before I forget to mention it, one of the things about Men In Black that absolutely drives me crazy is the fact that it's quite dated in the late 90's.  It's action-packed, but not in an unpredictable kind of way.  Watching this film, it feels more like the movie producers are showing off their ability to present special effects.  These kind of films have improved in recent years thanks to an improvement in storyline quality, making a film like Men In Black feels dated in comparison.    A decent film, but also exceptionally cheesy and childish.  Be prepared for that.
B001HN694K|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, although towards the end of the DVD, the volume does drop, then return to normal.  It does this in three places.  I'd give it four stars, except for that.
0446567337|1.0|After much dileberation I think I have figured out why the book bothered me so much. Its like the author didn't have a clue about military life. He made it seem like the couple had no choice but for them to be apart. Either the love was so deep and intense that they would have made it work by marrying and her moving to Germany with him or the love wasn't what he portrayed it to be and wasn't worth the sacrifice. The author wrote the book like all military men stationed over seas can't have their families there with them and while in a few cases that is true it is not the norm and definetly not in Germany as far as I know. I guess there would be no epic heart wrenching ending if the author had done his homework but I felt the lack of knowledge on the subject just made the whole story irritating...
B001GM28HO|1.0|I am sorry to say, not to purchase this album. Every song on the album is terrible and not that good to listen to.    Here is my review for the album songs.    1. Just Dance- 2/5.

B000002MY3|5.0|I remember hearing Alanis' new single \\"Everything\\" back in 2004 and after hearing it, I begged my mom to buy the album 'cause I loved listening to \\"Everything\\". So my mom was willing to buy it for me but little did I know she bought me the wrong album and it turned out to be \\"Jagged Little Pill\\". I was really upset about it but I decided to just give the album a try and I was blown away; every song was good and Alanis' vocals were superb.    Here is my review for each song    1. All I Really Want- 5/5. I love how there are saxophones playing and I love Alanis' voice, even though she is screatching.    2. You Oughta Know- 5/5. More of an angry type song which I just love. I love it when she sings \\" I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner\\"    3. 2/5. This is a really beautiful song, but too slow for me.    4. Hand In My Pocket- 5/5. Seems to have a few catchy lyrics. I love how the beat is towards the chorus.    5. Right Through You- 5/5- Great vocal strength. Another good song written well by Alanis.    6. Forgiven- 5/5. I really seem to enjoy this song with Alanis' vocal strength. At first I did not enjoy it but it has grown on me.    7. You Learn- 5/5. Alanis' most popular and well know song to date. This song is so creative and so are the lyrics. You GO Alanis!    8. Head Over Feet- 5/5. One of my favorite songs on the album.    9. Mary Jane- 5/5. Another great song with Alanis' amazing vocals.    10. Ironic- 5/5. My favorite song on the album. I love it when she sings. \\" you won the lottery and died the next day\\" I also like how to song starts out slow and the chorus gets higher.    11. Not The Doctor- 3/5. I usually skip this song.    12. Wake Up- 4/5. Very catchy lyrics but I don't find this the best song on the album.    13. You Oughta Know- 5/5. Bonus track on the cd. Pretty much the same as the origional but a little higher and I do find this version much better than the origional.    Overal. 5/5. Go purchase this album. It is her best album to date.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|This film has excellent special effects.  Although I saw the 3D version at the theaters, the realism of the ships and the robots, etc, is excellent.  As long as you can ignore the gratuitous Ecological brain washing, you will enjoy this movie, specially at the $15 price I paid for it!
B0002OERI0|5.0|American Idiot has to be Green Day's best album. I don't enjoy Rock Operas but still this is their best album ever!  Here is my review for each song.    1. American Idiot- 5/5. The first single on the album. I believe this song is about George W. Bush.    2. Jesus Of Suburbia- 5/5. I really like this song but it's so long, due to the Rock Opera.    3. Holiday- 5/5. Another great song. Which encouraged me to buy the album in the first place.    4. Boulevard Of Broken Dreams- 5/5. Great song with great lyrics. I also like the best too!    5. Are We The Waiting- 5/5. I think this song is rather fun. It makes you wanna scream out \\"Are We The Waiting\\"    6. St. Jimmy- 5/5. I like this song but sometimes it can be boring.    7. Give Me Novacaine- 5/5. This song seems to be beautiful in a way. I like the lyrics also.    8. She's A Rebel- 5/5. My favorite song on the album.    9. Extroardinary Girl- 5/5. This song is good too but not my favorite.    10. Letterbomb- 5/5- I do like this song but it's so hard to understand!    11. Wake Me Up When September Ends- 5/5. A very beautiful song. Written about Billie Jo Armstrong's father whom passed away.    12. Homecoming- 4/5. Basically the same as Jesus Of Suburbia. Way too long    13. Whatsername- 4/5. This song is good. It starts out slow and then gets higher.    Overal. 5/5. Buy the album!
B00009AOBI|5.0|This was one of my favorites when it first came out...it is still one of the best!
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I think Yulia and Lena are great singers; singing with passion in their heart. Even thought they are not lesbians; these songs are still coming from their heart.    Here is my review for the album.    1. Not Gonna Get Us- 8/10. Great song to start the album with but not the best. I love it when Lena sings\\" You and me, let's just be honest\\".    2. All The Things She Said- 10/10. The Best song by TaTu and one of my favorites.    3. Show Me Love- 10/10. I can't stop listening to this song. I love it when they sing \\" Show me love, show me love, til you open up the door\\"    4. 30 Minutes- 10/10. Great slow song. I usually think of rainy days when I listen to this song.    5. How Soon Is Now- 10/10. Better than the Smiths. I love the guitar beat.    6. Clowns- 10/10. Great song but I don't understand it that well.    7. Malchik Gay- 10/10. I have now clue what it means but It is the best on the album.    8. Stars- 10/10. Very cool song. Lena's voice is amazing and so is Yulia's when she raps in Russian.    9. Ya Soshla S Uma- 10/10. Russian verison of All The Things She Said. I prefer the english verison than this version.    10. Nas Ne Dagoniat- 8/10. Better verison than the english.    Overal. 10/10. Go ahead and purchase this album.

B000YENUI6|2.0|I am very disappointed. The actors give it their best but how could you possibly save an ill-constructed story line????? It looks as if David Cronenberg wanted different kind of scenes (violence, sex etc...) and sort of patched them up together. I felt bad for Vincent Cassel, his script was soooo silly. The story is filled with loopholes. One more thing : inserting violence and sex for no other reason than for the wow factor is pathetic. I really wanted to like the movie, I mean, I love Viggo Mortensen, I could forgive him practically anything but geez!!! this movie is bad.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Thanks to my girlfriend I discovered this incredible show. The writing, the acting, the music, everything is so well done! Anyway, to keep it brief and direct:<br /><br />I bought this here on Amazon for a very good price, along with the first season, interested only in owning the show. Whatever extras come with the DVDs are just that, extras, and are not deal breakers for me. The image and sound quality are what to be expected from a DVD, the box and casing is very sleek and nice-looking. The DVDs are well organized and well attached to the box, so no concerns there.<br /><br />The show itself is sensational, first of all because of Dexter. All the dark humor, witty conversations (or thoughts), the excitement that builds up from how Dexter may react/behave and the potential outcomes that we try to predict are incredible fun. I cannot stress enough how good of a show Dexter is. I will not say much so I can avoid any and all spoilers. Don't worry if you've never heard about it or seen it, take the plunge and thank me later ;).<br /><br />To end, a few comments on what comes in the DVDs besides the show. There are a couple of episodes for other Showtime series, like Brotherhood/Californication (I think that's the name), as a pilot-episode sort of idea so we watch them and hopefully get interested. I didn't care for that. The Dexter extras are a bit lacking, I'd like to see more behind the scenes, interviews with the actors. It doesn't take away from the overall value for me but the show is so good that it made me want to know everything I could about everyone, and I'd like to see it in an interview style in the DVD, not having to search elsewhere.<br /><br />A must buy!
B0039UTDFG|1.0|Discovery needs to learn to stop insulting it's viewers with these \\"americanized\\" versions of BBC documentaries. Does somebody in the marketing department actually believe it's anything but tripe? And the slant to David Attenborough (for at least the 3rd time) is utterly indefensible. The channel wouldn't even exist without his remarkable career and influence. Oprah should have refused to do the show in protest. Shame on her as well.

1400031524|1.0|The characters are dull, uninteresting, and unlikeable, while the plot is incoherent and contrived.  The main political point manages to be even worse, especially when you take into account Mankell's reprehensible views on the Middle East conflict.  Do yourself a favor and skip this racist's petty excuse for a novel.
B0014E9188|5.0|The concert is just phenomenal.  The fact they did \\"Mother & Child Divided\\", \\"Buying New Soul\\", and \\"So Called Friend\\" is amazing unto itself. But then you have the second disc, with a couple Rockpalast videos, some of the films used for the backdrop screen during three of the songs, and Gavin Harrison's \\"Cymbal Song\\".    Absolutely awesome DVD. If you're a fan, you have to at least see this.

B000000I0Q|3.0|While it is easy for any early Genesis fan to appreciate so many obvious elements retained here, even Hackett's highly assured debut cannot mask the fact that VOTA suffers from all the typical solo setbacks, from overindulged common characteristics to underdeveloped halfway harmonies, despite the few genuinely justified moves.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|I'd been wanting to see this or a while and only managed to get the chance tonight. I was expecting a lot, as the trailer made it seem inspirational, and recommendations from friends only enforced that expectation. I have to say that not only were my expectations met, but they were surpassed. It is a truly beautiful film in every possible way. The story it has to tell, the way it is shot, the actors and their characters, the overall feel of the film is just absolutely stunning. I was taken on a rollercoaster ride of emotion as one moment I would be laughing my head off, and the next I'd be literally in tears. This film is not just here to entertain and make money (although I'm hoping it does a lot of both), but it sends out a very important and poignant message about the image of Islam in the world since the shocking and terrible events of 9/11. Not just Islam, but it sends out a message about all religion with the use of a very simple statement; \\"Good people who do good deeds. Bad People who do bad. There is no other difference\\". Such a strong message to send and it says something so simple. We're all human and regardless of the religion we live by or the culture we have, our deeds are what make us good or bad people and not those labels applied by those other parts of our lives.<br /><br />The story follows the journey of Rizwan Khan (Shah Rukh Khan), a Muslim man with Asperger's Syndrome as he writes a letter to his wife Mandira (Kajol) while he is on a journey to give the President of the United States a message; \\"My Name Is Khan, and I am not a Terrorist\\". Through this letter he is writing, we come to learn about the emotions he truly feels and can't express when speaking due to his condition. We learn about his upbringing with his brother Zakir and his Mother in Mumbai, his arrival in America to work with his brother and his eventual falling in love with the woman who would be his wife, Mandira. Rizwan achieves the impossible. He has made a happy life for himself in America and kept a promise he made to his Ammi. This happiness is not to last, however, as the tragedy of 9/11 occurs turning Riwan and Mandira's life upside down in very frightening and tragic ways. The stereotyping of the Muslim terrorist begins to make its mark on the couple and put a strain on their relationship but, one day things hit rock bottom and their son, Sameer (Yuvaan Makaar) is killed in a racially motivated attack. This is the final straw and the relationship breaks apart and Rizwan is told to leave and in the heat of the moment, only to return when he has given the message to the US President.<br /><br />Out of my little description, I've missed out so much. There's a lot to take in from this film and something that you will enjoy as the film runs. Shah Rukh Khan deserves a very prestigious western award for his role in this film. Possibly even going as high up as an Oscar (although I'm sure there's some rule that would prevent that from ever happening) as his performance is magnificent and he is truly deserving of wider recognition in the western world. He steals the show as the personality and mannerisms of the character are maintained beautifully throughout, from the twitching of the neck to simply the way he speaks. There are times when his traits are hilarious, and others when they are frankly annoying. But you never lose sight of the genuine and caring nature of this character and you become adoring of his flaws as they simply vale what is a very sweet personality.<br /><br />This, in a sense, gives you more of a respectful understanding of the condition and how difficult it may be to cope with, especially in social circumstances, when you want to say something, but simply cannot express it the way you want. The message of everyone being simply being defined as being part of one of two groups, good or bad people, is one that I truly admire and taking on the topic of religion during such a raw and emotional time, and offering it from theperspective of an Asian family is a very brave and meaningful move.<br /><br />A beautiful film with a beautiful message, and by far the best film I've ever had the pleasure of watching.family is a very brave and meaningful move.

I don't think I would have purchased this without my son's encouragement. :) He first started the serious at school and has worked his way through the entire collection.<br /><br />Although I find some of the behavior of the children in the books disrespectful towards parents and other authority figures (which I do not encourage) I find children enjoy this series because they can relate with Stanley.<br /><br />I would recommend talking to your child about the different situations that Stanley gets into and how (if) he could have solved his problem differently.
030726999X|5.0|Love Stieg Larsson books (from someone who writes suspense myself and very picky). While his books are a LOT of telling, it doesn't matter - they keep me hooked and reading. This book is with Lisbeth mostly locked away but still great. Getting a little sick of other females and their needy ways (wonder what that says about Stieg). The body builder woman is so yuck - and dopey Kalle just keeps servicing her.  At any rate, only 100 more pages and I'll be in a desert with no gut grabbing books out there. I have the movie (dragon) on order so there's hope.

0812932293|4.0|Richard Branson is one of a kind for sure, but this book reads more like an adventure novel rather than a book on leadership or management. That's disappointing if that is your point in reading the book like me. However, Branson's courage, risk taking and leveraging life is enjoyable to read and you just get a sense that he squeezes everything out of every day. So, if you are looking for tips on how to improve your life, work or anything along those lines, this book is a bit shallow. If you are looking to understand Branson more and he is very interesting, this book will give you a great peep hole.
B001HN6940|4.0|Alice in Wonderland (2010) was a very different type of Disney movie I saw it in theaters in 3-D and wasn't impressed by the 3D effects but I did however enjoy the film. The blu ray gave me a second chance to enjoy this one a second time. The characters were very well represented, and Johnny Depp stole the show as The Mad Hatter. I do feel that the title of the film should have been \\"The Mad Hatter\\" or something of that nature for I don't believe this film should hold the same name as Alice in Wonderland the cartoon classic.    The [[ASIN:B001HN6940 Alice in Wonderland [Blu-ray]]] contains some good special features, but not as many as I would have liked. The video quality was fantastic and the sole reason why I am giving this film 4 stars. I am glad to see that studios are finally releasing films in 1:78:1 ratio that fill my entire HDTV screen without black bars. The audio is top notch and sounds great even without a home theatre system.    Being that I love almost all disney movies, I had to purchase this one and I do recommend others check it out for it does fufill its purpose of entertaining. Being a Tim Burton film, one must be aware that his style is alive and well, so weather or not that is good or bad for you, be aware that it is here.

That is rare for me.  I highly recommend this book and the whole trilogy.  While I was fully involved from the first page of the first book, I can see the criticism from some that the first 100 pages were slow and dense.  Stick with it.  It will be well worth it.

B00138H146|4.0|Lou Reed put out three strong albums near the beginning of his solo career, three that established his reputation. Regardless of what he might have done since then, [[ASIN:B00138D27Q Transformer]], [[ASIN:B00138H28Q Berlin]] and \\"Rock and Roll Animal\\" will be the core of his solo career's legacy. This album originally had five tracks but now two songs have been tucked into the middle to fill it out a bit. With the original song times often clocking in between seven and a half and thirteen minutes it does lend itself to being a remembrance of the seventies. Nevertheless, this is quite possibly the best band most people will ever remember hearing on a Lou Reed album.<br /><br />If you've got limited storage on the mp3 player, the first cut is the definitive version of \\"Sweet Jane\\" and that's the one I'd download from \\"Rock and Roll Animal\\". Don't be frustrated by its being listed as \\"album only\\", you can download this identical recording from the anthology [[ASIN:B00138HBDM Between Thought And Expression]]. It times out at 7:57 there probably due to some difference in audience noise or applause as the track fades out. The same recording is also downloadable from the compilation [[ASIN:B0013AT01G Different Times - Lou Reed In The 70's]] where it clocks at 8:02.

0321525655|3.0|Conceptually, Presentation Zen is an excellent book. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy it as much as I would've wanted to.<br /><br />Let's start with the good. I love Garr Reynolds's artistic approach to slide design, giving a death kneel to the ubiquitous bullet points. This is where the book really shines, and where you will learn the most. If this section would have been expanded to form the entire book, I would be in heaven.<br /><br />Here's what I didn't like. Plenty of concepts are mentioned repeatedly, degrading the reading experience when the book is read cover-to-cover. There's also some typographical errors in the book, an issue that always gets me fuming.<br /><br />But my largest gripe is about the font chapter. There is no such chapter. With plenty of sample slides showing how a changed font can improve upon a slide design, not a single word is written on font usage.<br /><br />To summarize, the concepts and ideas put forward on slide design are great, and I know that my slides will look better next time I design a slide deck. However, I think that the book is not reaching its full potential, with a halting treatment on slide design - the book's claim to fame.

Young girl grows up & pulls a \\"Maria von Trapp.\\"  She falls in love with the \\"master of the house\\", where she serves as governess.  If you can put aside the bizarre laughter from an upper room, a fire of unknown origins which nearly kills the master, and the arrival & stabbing of a mysterious house guest, Jane Eyre seems to be doing OK for herself in these fine gothic digs!    A split second or two before tying the knot with the master of the house, someone bursts in to announce that there's an impediment to the marriage.  The master of the house / casd is already married.  \\"Ok, Ok,\\" he acknowledges - \\"But my wife is insane.  That's her laughing upstairs, starting fires, and going around stabbing people.\\"      Jane leaves said cad at the altar & at the gothic digs.  Unbeknownst to Jane, Mrs. Cad latr dies in a tragic fire in which Mr. Cad is seriously injured (Entirely too convenient.  I'd like to bring the CSI team in on that one.).    On her own from Mr. Cad, Jane inherits a fortune from a mysterious uncle (Does anyone actually have relatives like that?).  Some time later, she returns to the gothic digs & Mr. Cad.  They finally marry & live happily ever after.    This is classic literature?
B003A4IFDW|2.0|I listened to the NPR interview with Betty LaVette and when I heard that Pete Townsend liked her version of \\"Love Reign on Me\\", I was sold on buying her albulm.  Now I regret it.  She may be one of the diva's of Blues, but it was evident that she was unfamiliar with the genre she was interpreting.  Her barely recognizable \\"Wish You Were Here\\" was the warning shot.  Then I realized she was doing the same thing to just about all the cuts.  I understand she was transforming these rock legends into the blues, but she did a lousy job.  The majority of the songs sounded alike, as if she had one template and crammed these works into it.  I would rethink buying this if I were you.  Buy her stuff, blues by a blues singer.  If your looking for anything but a bland, lackluster attempt to cash in on a reasonable idea, go elsewhere.

The constant explosions and \\"look over here\\" noises of the summer Blockbuster has gotten so insufferable that it isn't possible to have a story anymore, but \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" manages a rare thing: it keeps its pace so quick that the bored children won't reach for their cell phones, but it does not resort to deafness or cliche.     Oh, there are plausibility holes, and there are signs of the director's own personal and private interests, and this Holmes isn't Holmes any more than 2009's \\"Star Trek\\"'s Kirk was Kirk.  These are rewrites, not appropriations, but I do not believe it is cynical or cheap.  Besides, the movie is fun.

Did you really think a show like this would NOT put out a special boxed set at the end of the series?  You think you deserve a discount??  Why should you get a discount because you were not patient enough to wait for the complete set?  Here's an idea...why don't you trade in your five seasons for a little cash to put towards the Complete Collection?<br /><br />And for those of you who had a problem with the finale not living up to your personal expectations and thus ruining the whole Lost experience for you, it is not fair to \\"spoil\\" the series for those who have not seen it.<br /><br />I have followed Lost since the beginning, and have been patiently waiting for this boxed set.

1573229725|4.0|Let me begin by saying that Fingersmith  is the first novel in recent memory to incorporate a plot twist so unexpected and surprising that I actually exclaimed out loud (\\"I think I said \\"Holy Crap!\\" or something equally insightful.  Don't judge me... it was a shocking twist.)  I love that.  For better or worse, I am a very difficult reader to surprise.  Fingersmith actually surprised me twice.  Set in my very favorite literary time and place, Victorian England, Fingersmith is a tale of intrigue full of memorable characters, an intricate and surprising plot and vivid period detail.  It is truly a remarkable book.  The novel is divided into three parts: the first tells the story from Sue Trinder's perspective, the second tells the story from Maud Lilly''s perspective and the third finishes out the tale, moving forward from where their stories merge...  or diverge, as the case may be.<br /><br />Part One is arguably the best storytelling work I've read in recent memory.  It is spell-binding and I couldn't put the book down.  Part Two is interesting because it is essentially a retelling of Part One from a completely different perspective with the addition of lots of great (and also unexpected) background information on Maud Lilly.  Part Three brings the story to fruition... but Part Three is also the reason I dropped the plot rating from 5 to 4.5... once the stories rejoin and the plot moves forward to its conclusion, the novel loses a lot of momentum.  Fingersmith is like a thoroughbred... really fast and vastly superior for short distances, but lacking a bit in endurance. Part Three contained a twist or two of its own, but was essentially a waiting game with little by way of new action or intrigue.  Or maybe I'm just holding it to the impossibly high standard set forth in Part One.<br /><br />Waters does a brilliant job of portraying life in Victorian England - both rural and city life.  I'm a bit of a snob about this period... it has to be perfect.  And Fingersmith's setting really was perfect.  The characters are equally well-developed with a wide variety of personas, all in keeping with Victorian standards and yet each with their own idiosyncrasies and often startling secrets.  The premise of the novel is absolutely fresh and thoroughly unique.  I can certainly see why Fingersmith put Sarah Waters on the map, so to speak.  There is no arguing the talent of an author who writes a book like Fingersmith.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:  An engrossing and intricately detailed historical novel full of intrigue and unexpected plot twists.  A must-read for fans of the genre.<br /><br />This review originally appeared on my blog.  See profile for details.setting really was perfect.

B002HREKCI|4.0|Saying this is up on my list should mean that it gets five stars right? My main criticism for this book is that I would have liked if Hanna Barker were to give more ways how people could of helped her and more signs that she had of suicide. That way this book doesn't only show that the little things we do can add up to a big result. But it would also then give teen readers ways they could recognize and help those who they fear are suicidal. If it wasn't for the potential I see for this book to be a teaching aid in suicide it would have five stars. But it just didn't give enough material to help a teen reading it see the signs and help a classmate who is suicidal.

B0031ZWZR2|4.0|FlashForward is an amazing show that doesn't have long-term staying power.    Let's face it: How many times can we watch the FBI fight mysterious mental blackouts and pursue the purveyors of those frightening global phenomenon?     Not long.    As I watched the first half of Season One on DVD, I was surprised ABC didn't try to make this a one-season wonder. The premise fits a short-term show. It certainly deserves more time than a four-hour special movie event that would completely rip any depth from the idea.    FlashForward is loosely based on the 1999 novel of the same name by Canadian SF/F author Robert J. Sawyer.    For two minutes and seventeen seconds, the world falls into a mental blackout. In that time, people have visions of six months into the future - April 29, 2010. Those who don't have visions are called \\"ghosts\\" because many believe they will be dead.    One FBI agent (Joseph Fiennes) uses his vision to find the perpetrators.    FlashForward borrows heavily from the highly-successful LOST formula. There are a quick succession of scenes, details that lead to more questions than answers, and sequences out of chronological order. There is also a kangaroo that keeps showing up - like the LOST polar bear (or the monster) and two LOST alums -  Dominic Monaghan (Charlie) and Sonya Walger (Penny) - as part of the cast.    Luckily, the show isn't a cookie cutter version of LOST, otherwise it would be a waste of time and obvious ratings grab by ABC. Still, as I realized just how much it borrowed from LOST, I wondered if ABC hoped to have a long-term replacement for the show, which had overstayed its welcome by the time the end came this year.     FlashForward is a finite series that will be an incredible watch for fans if ABC doesn't stretch it out into infinity.    The first 10 episodes of the show are available for free on the ABC Web site, or on a two-disc DVD set, which includes a few intriguing extras about how they created chaos after the global blackout.There is also a short flash into the future of the second half of season one - one that makes me want to watch, even though I am adamantly opposed to splitting up seasons for profit.
B003A4IFDW|4.0|They're called \\"classic rock songs\\" for a reason. Classic rock records are well-loved fossils holding space in yours and my iPods, decorating our walls and tee shirts with their art, and playing 24/7 on everything from TV series openings to radio as far away as satellite's Classic Vinyl or as close as the \\"Eagle\\" or \\"Fox\\" in your town. Their riffs are anticipated from the song's first note; they're  universal baby boomer comfort food.<br /><br />But great songs from any area stand the test of interpretation. They can be slowed, hardened,  and opened to personal experience, opportunities unanticipated when the Moody Blues close with their gong or the Who with Roger Daltrey's demanding wail.<br /><br />On \\"Interpretations,\\" soul survivor Bettye LaVette challenges and wins you over with a baker's dozen of these beloved British rockers. The Beatles are represented collectively (\\"The Word\\") and three members individually: she finds the sullen blues melody in Ringo's \\"It Don't Come Easy\\" and walks slowly with McCartney-style,  Abbey Road-esque  piano on \\"Maybe I'm Amazed.\\" She turns the plaintive cries \\"I love you,\\" the most overlooked part of the anthemic \\"Nights In White Satin,\\" back into the desperation of its forebear, Ben E. King's \\"I Who Have Nothing.\\" She drains the irony from the Rolling Stones \\"Salt of The Earth\\" transforming it into salute and challenge worthy of Aretha Franklin's brazen 60's reinventions (\\"The Weight,\\" \\"Eleanor Rigby.\\")<br /><br />By rights, this should have closed \\"Interpretations\\" as it did \\"Beggars Banquet\\" or \\"Good Night\\" closed the White Album; minutes of sarcastic calm permitting rest after the anger and dissonance of those two seminal 1968 albums. But LaVette gives speed and intimacy to Clapton (\\"Why Does Love Have To Be So Sad\\") and intimacy to Elton John at his most glamtastic (\\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me,\\" which could have gone to see after George Michael's horrid remake.) Her measured live version of \\"Love Reign O'er Me\\" (which inspired her producers to take this project) may in context do for her what Tina Turner's appearances with Rod Stewart a generation ago did to return her glory.<br /><br />If you loved Tina Turner's \\"Private Dancer,\\" or these songs in their original contexts, buy this and reacquaint yourself. Bettye LaVette separates rock's dinosaurs from their signatures, revulsion and rebellion. Her reinventions show their lyric vulnerability, return them to their blues roots and reintroduce their songs and message distinct from their beloved bluster. Lovingly, strongly recommended.o take this project) may in context do for her what Tina Turner's appearances with Rod Stewart a generation ago did to return her glory.

The problem is that at the end of the book the reader is left \\"hanging\\" as to what happens next. I cannot imagine there will not be a sequel. If there is not, I would rate the book much lower. If there is, I would then give it a very high rating. You need to read the book for yourself to see what I mean.

B003C1QIO6|4.0|For almost a decade, Hawai'ian-born singer Jack Johnson has been turning out album after album of his smoothly mellow, acoustic beach rock.  Releasing six albums over the past nine years, Johnson has become one of the most popular singer-songwriters of recent times and has gained a very large following of passionately mellow fans. His music is nice, sweet, and fun. . . perfect to have on your iPod for a day at the beach (or, as I've come to discover, perfect to listen to whilst studying & working).    While it's difficult to really separate some of Johnson's music, I feel there is no reason to.  To me, he's kind of like a modern-day Jimmy Buffett with a bit of Bob Marley mixed in for good measure.  I have never been disappointed by a single one of Jack's albums because I know precisely what to expect when I turn one on for the first time: the same ol' happy-inducing mellow music we've all come to love.    With `To the Sea,' my expectations were in the same place they've always been.  The album itself, however, exceeded them.  While, to many, it may just seem like the same music we've been hearing since 2001's release of Brushfire Fairytales, To the Sea is actually a nice step forward musically.  The guitar work is better than previous work, and the accompanying beats by the band seem more up front than they have been in earlier recordings.  The lyrics are about on the same level as Jack's other records, but that's still quite a compliment.    Overall, To the Sea is a great addition to the Jack Johnson library.  It's a fun, breezy, and (of course) mellow album with the expectedly solid vocals accompanied by some of the band's strongest backup music to date.  Head down to the coast with this album and you won't be disappointed.    -AP3-

If she had a noble start I would call her a sell out, but she started this way, and that is why we have the tag \\"pop\\".  Her music (somehow.. ) connects to millions of left out teenagers.    She does a great job marketing her self, the crazy dresses and all.  But she doesn't have any music to back it up.     And.. She is nothing like Marilyn Manson.  Marilyn Manson is Gothic, Lady Gaga is just trying to attract attention to her soulless music.

They are clearly targeted to little kids, unlike the mature audience of their first two albums.  Instead of singing about things teens care about, they are singing about things BABIES care about.  Seriously.. who writes a song about Valentine's day..  They are trying to connect to an audience who is still in diapers.

B0036EH3WK|5.0|I watched the first 2 and a half season on ABC and had to watch the rest right before the 6th season started, Via Netflix Instant Queue and since i have not bought any season yet, this collection was great news. I will be watching the entire series again starting on the day it arrives at my doorstep!
B002VPE1B6|2.0|Put succinctly, and echoing what others have already addressed, Avatar on Blu-Ray is an incredibly visually stimulating experience.  Alas, I was underwhelmed by this frugal iteration as it \\"special-features challenged\\".  That is, the ONLY \\"extras\\" one is given here is ability to choose subtitles and a choice of language...THAT'S IT!    If what others have revealed is factual (that there will be a future edition with extras), then I strongly encourage everyone to patiently await its arrival.  Frankly, I am disappointed and would like my money back.

1594481717|5.0|Fasten Your seatbelt! Daniel Pink is about to take you for a ride.... into what was (at the time) the future, yet is now the present! After reading his classic Free agent Nation, I was eagerly anticipating a whole New Mind. And it did not dissapoint.<br /><br />Pink opens with his argument that we are moving from an economy and socioty based on the \\"logical, linear\\" cababilities of the Information age to an economy built on the \\" emapthic, big picture\\" capabilities of the Conceptual age. And to survive in this era  we will need to develop our right brain capabilites ( inventiveness, empathy, joyfulness, meaning et. ceterra). This is so, in Pinks view, because the type of work that was previuosly dependant on the \\" left brain capabilies ( sequential,logical,analytical) can be easliy replaced by automation and/ or lower cost employees in Asia.<br />In addition, the unprecedented material abundance that we have experienced has left many of us searching for greater \\"meaning\\" in our lives (and purchases). This thirst for meaning - the author points out-  will also be satisfied primaly by \\"right brain functions\\".<br /><br />Sounding a bit like a recovering left brain addict, Pink takes us through the \\"six senses\\" that support the Right Brain ( What he calls \\" R-Direceted)  aptitudes. And they are:<br /><br />Design<br />Story<br />Symphony<br />Empathy<br />Play<br />Meaning<br /><br />After a chapter explaining each, he follows with very specific ideas  -action steps- that can help us to further develop these aptitudes. I have already followd through on 3 of the suggestions and am a better person, both personaly and profesionally, for doing so.<br /><br />The only downside to the book is that there is SO much information that one can feel overloaded and shut it all out. But for the most part- it is right on the Money. I have read hundreds of business books and in my view, Pink is the best business writer of our era- and a whole new Mind may be his best work yet!
B0036XN2L2|5.0|From start to finish this is their strongest release since \\"Love at First Sting\\", they recaptured the energy and passion they had back in the mid 80's. To bad it's the last album, but better to go out with a BANG! The only problem is with the record company. Why does North America only get 11 songs? Else where there's an extra track (Let's Rock), at least you can buy it on Amason or itunes, but the Japanese release has a bonus track (Thunder and Lightning) which is one of the best songs from \\"Sting of the Tail\\", and impossible to buy as a download, so if you want it you have to dishout 30$+ to get all 13 tracks! I've been a Scorps fan since '78, so since this is the last release it would have been nice for the longtime fans to get a few tracks with ex-members like Uli Jon Roth '74-'78, Francis Buchholz '75-'91, Hermann Rarebell '77-'91 and why not Michael Schenker who played on \\"Lonesome Crow\\" and \\"LoveDrive\\" and became a star on his own with UFO and MSG. Well, I know I'm dreaming, but hey, maybe the record compamy $$ could convince the Scorpions to record with old members and release it as a Japanese import $$,lol!
1439148953|4.0|\\"Colm Toibin's \\"Brooklyn\\" gently draws the reader into the life of a young Irish girl, Eilis Lacey. There is little work in post World War II Ireland. Her two older brothers had previously been forced to move to England to find work and due to the encouragement of her beloved older sister, Rose, and the sponsorship of a visiting priest from America, Eilis leaves the home she shares with Rose and their widowed mother and travels from a small town in Ireland to seek employment in Brooklyn. What I found most interesting was Eilis' gradual immersion into life in America, which was so different from the life she left behind. Brooklyn truly proves to be the land of opportunity for Eilis. She lives in a boarding house owned by an Irishwoman, finds work at a local department store and attends classes in bookkeeping at night. She meets a young Italian man, Tony, who introduces her to more of life in America. When a tragedy forces her to return to Ireland, she has to decide where her future lies. So much more than just the story of a young immigrant girl becoming an independent woman, Brooklyn itself, and the complexity, diversity and opportunity found there almost seems to be a character in the book.\\"
B003ICWTR4|5.0|. . . and blew us all away !!    I was there  It will be great.  And if you know where to look you can find DVDs of the Jersey gigs - and I am told (ahem) that they're pretty good too !!!  I was lucky enough to catch Bruce at three gigs on that tour and he was wonderful each time - trust me from what I have seen, read and heard about this DVD/blu ray you won't be disappointed
B0034C9CFK|5.0|All of teh songs on this album are very good.  I need to play this album again soon while on my next raod trip.
B002NXPTDK|5.0|Like most people I'm sure, I first heard about CuDi through his song Day N Night.  I found it intriguing and decided to check out his mixtape \\"A Kid Named Cudi.\\"  Intriguing indeed, definitely one of my favorites at the time.  Specifically I wanted to hear more songs like \\"Embrace The Martian\\" and \\"The Prayer.\\" As impressed as I was by the mixtape I wasn't prepared to be as blown away as I was by the CD.  My wish was granted and presented in a way I'd never expected.  Man On The Moon is the work of a musical genius, including a story being told throughout.  The dedication and effort CuDi put into this debut album is apparent and I'm eagerly awaiting MOTM2: The Legend Of Mr Rager.  CuDi is truly in his own genre combining Hip Hop and Electronica to perfection.  This guy has seriously earned a spot as one of my all-time favorites (which is NOT an easy task).  He cares about his music and his fans all while being talented beyond belief.  If you have any interest in this kind of music do yourself a favor and pick  it up.  Like yesterday.  Even if this isn't your normal cup of tea, I doubt you'll be disappointed.    My Top 5:    5) My World  4) Soundtrack To My Life  3) Solo Dolo  2) In My Dreams  1) Pursuit Of Happiness

B002VPE1AW|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I highly recommend it to everyone of all ages.
B000G7599Y|5.0|I recently ordered this box set of Mozart Symphonies via Amazon marketplace and have enjoyed listening to each and every symphony. The Berliner Philharmoniker does an outstanding job.<br /><br />Karl Bohm was was not the only one to record a complete cycle of Mozart symphonies, but his version is the benchmark cycle. If you only want one cycle of Mozart, then make this your choice. The other reviewers have already explained in detail why this set is worth getting, so I won't repeat what has already been said. Loved Bohm's rendition of Smyphony 25, that was one of the highlights of this set, along with the later symphonies 35-41.<br /><br />On the other hand, I will point out that there are other conductors you should listen to alongside Bohm. Bruno Walter (One of Karl Bohm's teachers), George Szell and Karl Bohm (in no specific order) were the best Mozart conductors of the 20th century in my opinion. Walter's recordings on Sony are out of print, but some of the George Szell discs are available on Sony and worth considering. However, only Karl Bohm did a complete cycle, the other two just did a few highlights. Again, I highly recommend Bohm, but I feel Szell and Walter are worth mentioning, as many people tend to overlook them and focus largely on the big European Orchestras.<br /><br />Buy this box set!
044022425X|4.0|The fourth in the Outlander series, Drums of Autumn takes off a bit after the third book ends.  As a recap (and a bit of a spoiler if you haven't read the first 3) we learn in the previous installments that Claire, a nurse from the 1940's has traveled back in time to 18th century Scotland.  There she falls in love with dashing Jamie Fraser and is forced to leave him when a great battle dawns on the horizon.  When she learns of his fate 20 years later in his own time, she has to decide between him and their daughter, and what point in time she will go to.  When she leaves for the past, she quickly finds Jamie but a series of adventure has them setting out for America in search of Jamie's missing nephew.  While they have many adventures in the Caribbean, they are eventually shipwrecked on the shores of Georgia.<br /><br />Drums of Autumn starts with their struggling to make a place for themselves in America.  They reunite with Jamie's aunt and while they are happy staying with her, Jamie has no wish to inherit her property.  Seized by his need to get away, he takes up the government's offer to homestead the land and claim a place of North Carolina for himself.<br /><br />While the going is tough and they are often faced with the hardships of working a wild land, they manage to carve out a home for themselves.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in the future, their daughter Brianna has discovered that they will be killed in the year 1776.  Desperate to warn them, she goes back into the past, swiftly followed by her boyfriend Roger who is deeply in love with her.  Surprisingly, they find their way to North Carolina, but a series of events will endeavor to keep them apart.<br /><br />Like always, Gabaladon writes with a great deal of detail.  Her characters are rich and full of life and she makes you feel as if you really know them.  I do fault her for the character of Roger however.  In the previous books he was his own person, but with this book I found him sounding and acting more and more like Jamie.  She is great at making distinct characters and it made me wonder why she would have her two main male characters almost identical.  It was as if she was so used to writing Jamie that Roger morphed into him.<br /><br />Like the other novels, with the exception of a few parts, it is written in the first person from Claire's point of view.  All other parts are told in the third person.<br /><br />Unlike some of her other books, while this one does contain a bit of violence, it is not heavy handed and adds to the book rather than just being there to be there.  There were several times that I caught myself skipping the pages just to hurry up and find out what was going to happen.<br /><br />While it is not as good as the previous two I still found this book to be a tremendous work of writing.  I look forward to the next in the series.<br /><br />Drums of Autumn<br />Copyright 1997<br />880 pageseat at making distinct characters and it made me wonder why she would have her two main male characters almost identical.

B003L5LEYW|5.0|This CD is an awesome collaboration, and to see the 2 of them perform live is just amazing. This is a must have. Favorite tracks 1-13!!!
B00079FUI6|5.0|Got this as a gift for my Mom for Mothers day and she loved it!  Price was great and shipping was very fast!  Will buy from again!!!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This is the third book in the series and I started it eagerly to see what was going to happen next. Had a hard time getting into it. The story dragged a lot at the beginning - it was actually pretty boring. I had to force myself to keep reading ... and I'm glad I did because the ending was worth it!
B00275EGX8|1.0|In a sentence, \\"what a cheesy, inaccurate, and pointless war movie.\\" If you want to call it a war movie. I love war films and this one is at the bottom of the list as far as this genre is concerned. I thought it would be good since it one so many Oscars. What a joke!
B003405MF6|4.0|I tell my guitar playing teenage sons, if Eric Clapton is Rembrandt, with that incredible tone, yet remaining classic and precise in his runs and fills, Jeff Beck is Picasso, doing things no one ever thought of doing before with an electric guitar.  His ability to make the guitar sound like a human voice or a violin or cello, mainly by manipulating his whammy bar, is uncanny.<br /><br />In this CD, the even-numbered songs provide particularly good displays of that skill.  Over the Rainbow, Elegy for Dunkirk, Serene and the amazing Nessum Dorma, the last of which made everyone's jaws drop in the live shows he gave earlier in the year, are all strong  achievements in this vein. Hammerhead combines that lyrical touch with some pounding rock-band-and-orchestra riffs that also make for a very strong track.<br /><br />Of the odd-numbered songs, Corpus Christi and Lilac Wine share the lyrical style and are worth listening to.  There is little to complain or praise about Never Alone; it was just a little bland. The two Joss Stone songs also came off as ordinary. With only ten songs on a CD of only 40 minutes, I felt that there should be no blandness or ordinariness, especially given that Jeff's penchant for covers gives him a very large amount of potential material to work with. For that reason I limit my rating for the whole CD to 4 stars.
0307341569|5.0|Most \\"survivor\\" stories are about \\"truth\\" and \\"justice.\\" This one is about survival. Twenty-five years later, unable to really function in society and needing money, the protagonist - Libby Day - has agreed to help a group that believes her brother is innocent. The twist? It's just a way for her to make money. She has no desire to prove her brother innocent or revisit that time.    The book is told from Libby's point of view in the present day, with flashbacks to the twenty-four hours leading up to the murders. Those flashbacks are told from various family members' points of view. Mostly Libby, her mother, and her brother.     It's a pretty grim and unremitting look at a life of poverty. Both when she was young and now. Depression, anger, community biases, prejudices, all those things. \\"Dark Places\\" doesn't just refer to where she goes mentally when remembering what happened. Or the dark place her brother was in to have supposedly committed the murders.     The style of writing is captivating. It made me want to know.  It was very hard for me not to flip to the end and see who the murderer was. That's not something I usually have problems with. At some points I had to mentally \\"sit\\" on my hands to avoid flipping to the last few pages. The pacing of the book was great, I was just so invested in the story I wanted to know now.    The book is bleak, disturbing at times, but overall enthralling.
B0038VPB5W|5.0|I counted down the days until this CD was released because to me Bullet For My Valentine is just one of those bands that are truly unique and have a killer sound. When I sat down and put this CD in to listen to it I have to say I loved it! The CD starts off heavy and ends just as heavy. This like their other CDs has some slower tunes but they still blow you away. I would definitely buy it if you are a fan of theirs:)
1439190275|5.0|Like the way this book is written. Have read the Diet Revolution years ago. This new book is easier to understand and to skip through. Like it very much.  Also I am losing weight easier this time around.
B003C1QIO6|4.0|Let's cut to the chase: if you have all Jack's other albums you've already bought this album or will (and you should, it's essential Jack johnson). If your interest in Jack has waned after the Curious George album (which is hard to consider a \\"true album\\" IMO) and the more melancholy Sleep Through the Static then I would definitely recommend this, it may renew your love of Jack. Although this album features all the typical elements from Jack's previous albums, I would say it is more akin to \\"On and On\\", not as poppy as \\"In Between Dreams\\" but more upbeat and enjoyable than \\"Sleep Through the Static.\\" People (critics especially) give Jack alot of grief for playing the same style of laid back songs and not mixing it up or being \\"edgy\\" enough. Personally, I respect Jack mostly for NOT giving in and pandering to the forces and expactations of the biz. I grow tired at times of artists I initially like but get pretentious trying to push the envelope and reinvent themselves only to lose sight of what made them great to begin with. Ultimately, I think all anyone wants are good songs with good melodies, and that's exactly what Jack delivers.        I think \\"To the Sea\\" will rank as some of Jack's best work. I loved the catchy upbeat \\"You and Your Heart\\" which kicks off the album. I was a little worried upon my first listen when the following two tracks were slower and more melancholy. They're good songs, but I was afraid given that the album is dedicated to his father who recently died of cancer it would sink into being a sad slow album. NOT SO! The album really picks up from there offering a great mix of mostly upbeat, almost \\"garage rock\\" at times, tunes as well as island influenced songs and the classic typical folkier mellow tunes with great melodies, messages and harmonies that you would expect from Jack. I really like the rougher mixes and more live sound of the recordings. It really gives you the feel like you're listening to a garage band of great friends playing simple songs together after a day of surfing and hanging out. Which is exactly the case with Jack!! My only real criticism is that at times the songs don't seem to flow together real easily giving the album more of a \\"cut and paste\\" feel from whatever songs he'd been working on. Also, sometimes the extra instrumentation of Zach Gill on keyboards serves the song well, but other times it sounds a little too much like ALO and leaves me wishing for an even more stripped down (guitar, bass, drums only) sound like on Jack's first three albums. Overall, its a great enjoyable album that will get plenty of repeat plays this summer and has enough depth to dig into well after that last summer sunset.
B003A4IFDW|5.0|I just couldn't wait for this to be released, after hearing her on NPR.  Played LOUD, in the car, windows closed, no one to hear my lousy singing, paying homage to the diva.  She is what I tried to be, only with great success.  Go Bettye!
1603425381|4.0|First, this book is a pleasure to browse.  It has nice colors, good type, and great schematics.  There are truly 150 borders, and if you see one on the cover you like, it will be in the book (I checked four of my favorites, and they were all there).  Unfortunately, the border you like may not be easy to find.  This book would have been improved with a picture index of the borders available collected on a few pages at the beginning OR a numerical index of which borders are found where on the covers (as some doily books are known to do).  Before you buy, you should note that the book is oddly dimensioned.  The picture Amazon shows is the entire cover...not the top half of a full-sized cover, which makes the number of pages in the book twice what an ordinary sized pattern book would have with the same number of patterns.  The book itself might also have benefited from a spiral rather than a standard paperback-type binding.<br /><br />Next, the borders are different from what I have seen in other books.  I have at least 10 border and edging books, and the ones here were different.  These edgings used front and back loop construction to get ridges in creative locations.  They had clusters, chains, lacy, and solid.  There was a great deal of variability in style from border to border, yet virtually all were worthwhile.  Even if I made an afghan a month, it would take more than 10 years to use all the designs I really liked.  Most of the borders were not more than 4 rounds, though many had suggestions of how to make them wider.  The colors were varied more than the author's previous motif book, and I thought they were prettier.<br /><br />Then, there are a few things I would have changed.  At least half of the borders have what I would call a \\"good\\" corner--a special treatment of the corner to make it stand out or a true right angle corner.  The other half of the borders do say what to do at the corner, but the corner treatments are basically to work the border along the entire edge, add a few very boring stitches to keep the corner from cupping, and then start the next edge.  (Basically, the corner would be \\"flat.\\"  Think of a 5dc, skip 2 stitches, sc in the center of a 3sc corner group, then continues with skip 2 stitches and 5dc group again.)  Several of the borders with arches did this instead of having some \\"design\\" or short arch at the corner.  (With the border described, I might put 9dc in the center of the 3sc group and have the skip 2 stitches before and after the border preceded by a sc, then 5dc).  I would have added a few stitches to the pattern and created a true design for the corner...every time.  Then, an option could have existed to have a pointed or flat corner depending on how many stitches were worked along the edge.  Thankfully, with even 75 good corners, I am not likely to use up the design ideas any time soon.<br /><br />Finally, I do highly recommend this book.  Despite the suggestions for improvement given in this review, this set of patterns is one I can see using for years to come.  The vast majority of the borders are lovely, well-written, and well-diagrammed.  The charts are helpful for seeing structure, and they are given for both a corner and for a straight edge.  The colors are pretty; the tips for working and introduction are well-done and helpful; and the overall presentation is top-notch.  This book would be a great addition to any crochet border library.a few very boring stitches to keep the corner from cupping, and then start the next edge.

B003ELOQCA|5.0|According to \\"Rolling Stone\\": \\"This is a stunning concert film shot by 27 high definition cameras documenting the epic scale of the band's montrous, clawlike stage....\\".\\"The sound is crisp and detailed ; new songs such as the closing \\"Moment of Surrender\\" feel like they've been reinvented in this setting.\\"    I have seen all of U2's prior concert DVDs, and all have their good points and bad points. I've reveiwed hundreds of concert dvds, I have a vast collection. In my opinion, this is the best U2 concert DVD. If want a professional opinion, read the \\"Rolling Stone\\" review.    This is a review of the 1 DVD Disc Set. There is also a 2 DVD Disc Set available.This concert was filmed on the 25th of October, 2009, at the Rose Bowl, in Pasadena, California. The stadium is packed to capacity. This was a show from their \\"2009 U.S.A., U2, 360 Degrees Tour\\". This is one of the biggest Rock & Roll Shows ever, it's huge. The stage is in the center of the Rose Bowl,(which is reminiscent of Def Leppard's \\"In the Round, In Your Face\\" DVD, from their \\"Hyteria\\" Tour back in the 80's, but U2's is a much larger scale). There are revolving walk-ways (kind of like the bridge on the Rolling Stones \\"Bridges to Babylon Tour\\" concert DVD). Plus, there is a big circular walk-way that circles the stage.    Also, U2 has this huge, round, big screen mounted on the top of the stage, that shows close-up's & light shows to go along with the music, sometimes it forms the shape of a \\"cone\\" and does other things. It's totally \\"Awesome\\". It has 4 arches, that look like \\"legs\\", holding it up. It looks like a \\"space alien/space ship\\" I didn't get to see U2 on this tour, but I had a friend who did, and he told me that it was the biggest Rock Show, he'd ever seen. After watching this dvd, I totally agree.    This concert DVD features some songs from their recent album, \\"No Line on the Horizon\\", along with their classics.    Disc 1 (The Concert): The song set with some comments & personal observations:  1.Get On Your Boots  2.Magnificent  3.Mysterious Ways  4.Beutiful Day  5.I Still Havn't Found What I'm Looking For - On this one, Bono includes a part of the Ben E.King song \\"Stand By Me\\".  6.Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of  7.No Line on the Horizon (Bono plays his electric guitar, along with The Edge on this one.)  8.Elevation  9.In a Little While - Includes the commander of the International Space Station, on the screen, and he makes some comments.  10.Unknown Caller  11.Until the End of the World  12.The Unforgettable Fire (On this one, The Edge plays keyboards.)  13.City of Blinding Lights (Includs great light show.)    14.Vertigo - Simply outstanding, and it includes a little bit of the Rolling Stones song \\"It's only Rock & Roll, But I Like It.\\"    15.I'll Go Crazy if I Don't Go Crazy Tonight (Includes an \\"Over the Top\\" light show on the big screen. At the end, Bono has a message for Iran & freedom. He states Iran, this is the U.S.A. calling Iran. The big screen shows an Iran woman, with her head covered, and Bono calls for freedom for Iranian women and Iranian people in general.) Bono, even states this message is even for people who don't like freedom. This quickly leads into \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\".    16.Sunday Bloody Sunday (Among other things, this shows a bus that was blown up by terrorists on the big screen.)    17.MLK (Bono talks about a woman for freedom who is being held in prison in Burma, she's been in prison for about 20 years, because of her stand for freedom. Bono mentions her name. Her name is Aung San Suu Kyi. Bono basically dedicates this song to her. Her picture and name is shown on the big screen, during the song. Bono mentions Martin Luther King, Jr, and Nelson Mendela, and how they were for non-violence, freedom, & for peace. This quickly goes into the performance of \\"Walk On\\".    18.Walk On - An Outstanding song & performance by U2. Again, this song is dedicated to Aung San Suu Kyi. During the song, many members of the audience are wearing her face mask, and her picture is shown on the big screen. During the song, \\"Walk On\\", there are volunteers from Amnesty International, walking on the circular walk-way that surrounds the stage. It fits perfectly with the song. Then the Bishop Desmond Toto introduces the song \\"One\\".    19.One - Bishop Desmond Toto introduces this song. He is shown on the big screen, and he talks about people who have faught for peace, non-violence, freedom, equity, & justice, in the old \\"Aparhied\\", South Africa, in the Civil Rights movement in the U.S.A., and in Northern Ireland. (On this one, Bono plays his electric guitar again). Bono ends the song \\"One\\", by singing \\"Amazing Grace\\", it gave me \\"chill bumps\\", and this quickly leads into the next song.    20.Where the Streets Have No Names - (This is a phenomenal perfomance, the crowd is really, really into this one.) Then you get a light show with a space alien & a lighted \\"Flying Saucer\\" that is shown on the big screen. The alien talks in \\"space alien language\\".    21.Ultra Violet/Light My Way - (On this one, Bono has a round \\"ultra violet\\" red light that circles his microphone.)    22.With or Without You (On this one Bono starts giving credits & thanks.)    23.Moment of Surrender (This is the last song, on this one they turn the Rose Bowl into the \\"Milky Way Galaxy\\". Bono has the audience members to turn on lights, from cell phones and etc., plus there are special lighting effects. They do an awesome performace of this song, then leave the stage, leaving the audience \\"spellbound\\", and me too. Then, that's it!!! You start getting song credits and all that kind of stuff on your TV screen, and it's over.     In Conclusion, this is One of the \\"Greatest Rock Concerts Ever\\", and certainly the best U2 concert dvd. Thanks!!!!!
0545123275|1.0|So.  I forced myself through the book.  I was intrigued by the first chapter.  I have to admit, the first chapter was enough to push me halfway through, and by the time I made it, I just went ahead and suffered through the rest of it, if only to have a good reason to write a one star review.  I didn't want to miss a world changing ending if there happened to be one at the end of this book.  There wasn't.  The book contains material that in theory, belongs in the older YA category, but the voice and tone of the story suggests younger.  I wasn't impressed with the dialogue, at all.  I think I laughed out loud, especially in instances of something like \\"Did you just tell him you went potty on yourself\\", blush hehaw, whatever.  Seems like Grace was created for Sam to dote on in an otherwise aimless existance, in which he either will or won't change forever into his wolf form.  He needed a reason to not change, so the universe threw him a paper thin Mary Sue, whom he loved inexplicably, and whole heartedly the entire way.  And she him, of course.  Don't even get me started on her parents, and Grace's characters inability to stick with any solid trait.  She seems whimsical and romantic in one moment, but apparently she's stoic and robotic.  Lacked a solid plot, lacked any real direction besides a sappy teenage romance, and I couldn't make myself care about either of them.  Or his beautiful yellow eyes.  They're not contacts, btw.

8172234996|5.0|The One Minute Manager is a very short book, in the shape of a modern tale in which  a young man wants to learn about some company and its esteemed manager. He meets him, he becomes exposed to his philosophy of work, and goes on to meet other members of the company; each of which presents another aspect of the One Minute Manager work ethic.    This is a book that everyone in business is required to learn in many countries, such as Japan, and I can see why. It is not only interesting for the work place, but you could learn a thing or two about the management of any human group, like a family, a club, or else.
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|If you like the Die Hard series, this movie does not disappoint at all.  I would put this one in my rating pool right after the first Die Hard.  (it was that good).  Well worth buying it on blu ray.
B002UZCJP2|2.0|This is not acceptable as a classic Bruce film.  I am totally disappointed. The plot was all over the place.  no favorite main character to hang your hat on.  It was a sloppy job.  Hated it!!
1582701709|2.0|I was so excited to get this book. Although it tells a good message, it repeats it over and over again. Nothing new after the first chapter. I was pretty dissappointed. If you want this book, buy Eat, Pray, Love instead.
B001NY4X4G|4.0|Primal Fear is an amazing movie with an amazing performance by a very young, and still new-to-movies Edward Norton.  The standard DVD has been part of our library for many years, and when I saw the Blu Ray version was out and so reasonably priced, I had to make an exception to my \\"don't replace\\" policy and bought the HD version.<br /><br />Watching it again, I'm struck by just how believable the characters are.  While the movie is technically a murder-mystery, it's really the character study of the lost boy that drives it.  Edward Norton is simply perfect in the role.  You accept the character, feel for him, and are shocked my him, all at the same time.  Richard Gere is fine form, and brings a combination of raw ambition and sincere believability to his role.  The chemistry between the two is hard to match.<br /><br />The Blu Ray is a good upgrade in picture quality.  It's not perfect, but it's an older movie.  The studio avoids doing too much noise reduction, so you do get some film grain.  But I always find that preferable to soft edges and blurred textures.<br /><br />If you have the standard DVD, should you upgrade?  I'm glad I did.  At the price, it's hard to beat, and is giving me a new round of appreciation for a truly suspenseful movie!
1423113381|5.0|Rick Riordan did wonderfully with this book.  I think it's a better beginning to a series than the Lightning Thief was, and I loved the Lightning Thief.  I read it in two days.  It's definitely worth having in your personal library!
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Yes, I realize my review title makes a bold statement.<br /><br />And most people who hear what this movie is about probably won't want to see it.<br /><br />But those who do will appreciate that this is one of the most economical yet profoundly moving meditations on life and death ever committed to celluloid.<br /><br />This is a film that had me in tears for the last hour and in tears again this morning, the day after viewing.  Not tears of sorrow or bitterness, but tears of empathy for -- and appreciation of -- the human condition.<br /><br />Beautifully acted, directed, written, and photographed, \\"Departures\\" hits a home run on every level.<br /><br />I could go into more detail about the story, but this is a case where the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts.  Let me just say that the film touches on life, death, love, and parenthood -- and penetrates to the core of each theme with a minimum of words and histrionics.<br /><br />I definitely recommend purchasing a copy of this film, as you will want to see it again and again with family and friends.<br /><br />Quite simply miraculous.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I was a child during the Disney Renaissance when Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and Little Mermaid were released and captured the hearts of children all over the world but Princess Tiana has streamed straight into my heart and ranks up there with my 2 other favorite princesses Belle and Aurora (from Sleeping Beauty).  Not just because she's African-American (although that's a huge plus) but I can relate to her having a dream and sacrificing a lot to accomplish it.  Her strong relationship with her family especially her father instilling a hard work ethic exactly mirrors my family life.<br /><br />The animation is absolutely beautiful!  I'm so glad to see Disney return to classic 2D animation from when I was a child.  I took my 11-year old sister to see this movie and she absolutely loved it!  It's a winner with children although the motives of the antagonist Shadow Man may be too complicated for really young kids but he's still entertaining.  There are so many comedic moments between Naveen and Tiana in their first meetings.  Louis and Ray are charming and hilarious as well.  Mama Odie was okay but VERY stereotypical.  On Disney Channel's The Proud Family, the character o SugaMama is almost an exact replica of Mama Odie.  But this is New Orleans so I'm almost willing to give that a pass.<br /><br />Another issue is the race of Naveen as Tiana's love interest.  As much as I love interracial relationships in movies I was hoping for a black prince.  But I quickly got over it.  Naveen has his moments but his personality doesn't really do anything for me so his race becomes irrelevant.  Disney movies are about the princess after all.  I do want my black prince at some point though.<br /><br />The animation, music, cast and historical landmark should be enough to win any Disney fan over though.  Anika Noni Rose really brings Tiana to life and the rest of the cast is spectacular.
0525423842|5.0|This is a great book for both children and adults. It builds on the suspense and creates the characters along the way. I found it to be a delightful change from Grisham's prior writings. Maybe the adults who did not like this book should give it to their children to read and let them review it. In addition, it sets up for the next book. Give it a chance - I think you will like it!
0743298039|4.0|I stumbled upon this novel while looking for others that shared the same romantic gothic style as The Meaning of Night by Michael Cox.  As an aspiring writer myself, I am always inspired to write my own stories when I read novels that pull me in from the very first page.  Dianne Setterfield's The Thirteenth Tale works its magic to intrigue the reader by recounting the past life of the reclusive author Vida Winter.  Setterfield smoothly flows from the past to the present and back again, and it's in the past tales that the atmospherics of a good gothic story emerge.  Although the novel is a good 406-pages long, all the loose ends seemed to tie themselves too quickly at the end.  But the marvel of this novel isn't how it ends, nor how believable any of it really could be.  It's how it keeps the reader engaged from page one with a beautiful story that is respectful of the art of storytelling, books, and the passion for literature.
1935251740|5.0|The only disappointed feelings that came while I was reading this book had to do with my mother ... a much-loved elementary school teacher who also did an A+ job of good parenting.  Lanza had parents who did F- jobs and look at what a flexible creative genius HE turned out to be!  Maybe dodo parents like HE had can do incredibly useful nurturing without ever intending to!  Ah well ... however it happened, thank whatever there is to thank that he is here, now (at least to me) to separate the warp and woof of today's interwoven science and religion; translate their \\"trinities\\" of biased thinking (300 year-old science ideas and 3000 year-old religion ideas found in scriptures); and clarify their own biased thinking in ways that may improve future operating beliefs in both fields of effort to obtain wisdom. Maybe collaboration is even a possibility, especially if the collaborator is the esoteric side of any participating religions.      Lanza cited closely matched ideas expressed by Emerson (now seen as philosophical leader of Unitarian doctrine) and similar philosophers, but makes no mention of small indigenous religions or esoteric versions of large religions (Judeo-Christian-Islamic in the West; Hinduist-Buddhist or Taoist-Confucian sacred philosophies in the East. Much of what Lanza says has been said in the past, sometimes the extreme past, by esoterically oriented individuals despite robust countering by their own exoteric (popular, mainstream) versions.     The only esoteric religion I have studied in depth not only translates biblical notions into physics-chemistry-cosmological and psychological language. It also says explicitly that as science proves to them that certain of their doctrinal ideas are mistaken, they will modify relevant assertions as needed to update them without losing cogency. In other words, some if not all esoteric religions have long respected and utilized science's findings in understanding AND evolving their base of wisdom.     Mythographer Joseph Campbell described esotericism, not as a BRANCH of a given religion, but as the spiritual CORE of religions in general, which tends to be ignored by most due to greater concern with the encircling CRUST that builds up around the core by environmental and political influences from the local areas in which they exist. Consequently, the esoteric belief systems of Jewish Qabalists, Christian Rosicrucians, and Islamic Sufis are extremely similar to each other; whereas their exoteric (popular mainstream) versions may be so different and members so incensed over the differences that they readily go to war in efforts to revenge insults and garner control.    I have great faith in scientists' ability to tolerate messages that imply the need for making different working assumptions and, as further such messages approach them, to move toward modifications that will greatly exceed those so long tolerated by esoteric religionists. I can't help wondering if the dramatic era change foreseen by Mayans for the year 2012 might include a revolution in science that could strengthen collaboration between itself and conscousness-centered esoteric religion. At the same time, I can't help hoping that the present-day back rubbing between fundamentalist exoteric (popular mainstream) religions and certain political entities might weaken instead of grow.
1400031524|3.0|A rubber boat floats to shore with two dead bodies and Wallander is assigned the case.  Who are these men?  Who called in the tip to the police that the raft could be found? Just when Wallander seems to be getting nowhere,  Latvia sends Major Liepa of the Riga police force to work on the investigation. This case will take Wallander to Latvia and into a politically driven plot with twists and turns as he strives to find the answers to several murders.  He encounters a passionate group of Freedom Fighters and begins to understand the political underbelly of Riga and the shadows that rule. It is a dark,dank and dreary world that he finds in Riga.  As usual Wallander's emotions rule the day and he throws himself headlong into a dangerous plot to help a group of Latvians discover the truth.  This is the second book in the Wallander series and differs significantly in that the social commentary is front and foremost.  I felt like Mankell teetered on the edge of melodrama with this one. There was alot of action and unlikely scenario's where Wallander survives by the skin of his teeth.  I missed the camaraderie and banter of the Ystad police force. In all though a good mystery but less enjoyable for me than the other books I've read in the series.
1423113497|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was a bit faster than most books and in the first person, which made it flow a lot quicker. Though, sometimes I do enjoy a lot of details while I'm reading. A great read for young adults and for more mature audiences who enjoy mythology in a modern day setting.
0618918248|5.0|I really don't think that I can add to the already excellent reviews that exist for this book, except to convey how persuasive he is in his argumentation.  One of my biggest pet peeves is when believers use faulty logic and bad argumentation in an attempt to advance their position.  If this book does nothing else but persuade even one believer to abandon his or her attempt at \\"scientifically\\" proving God's existence, then the book has succeeded.  Believers - you need to find a different way.<br /><br />If you are a believer, read this book - it will test your faith like nothing else.  On the whole, I feel that religion and belief have a positive, or at most, a neutral impact on the human condition, so I don't fully support his assertion of the negative impact of religion on culture.  But what I do think is important is that his assertion is worthy of study, and that to ask the question does not automatically require a believer (or non-believer) to choose sides before looking at the evidence.<br /><br />Thus, I recommend this book to both believers and non-believers, as well as those who are sitting on the fence.  There is something for everyone...

B000002MIY|3.0|\\"Kamakiriad,\\" Donald Fagen's second solo album, would get an extra star or two if the bar had not been set so high by his 1982 classic \\"The Nightfly.\\"  \\"Kamakiriad\\" is by all means a good album, but it falls short of the wonder of its predecessor.  Both feature classy, intelligent songs marked by smooth jazz-tinged arrangements, impeccable musicianship & sonics, and Fagen's distinctive vocals.  But the difference between the two concept albums lies precisely in their concepts.  \\"The Nightfly\\" was Fagen's nostalgic and sympathetic look back at his adolescent fantasies about the future, all seen through an optimistic and romantic 1950s lens.  There is a great warmth to \\"The Nightfly\\" largely because it sounds like Fagen really enjoyed his fond look back.  \\"Kamakiriad,\\" on the other hand, is a more detached affair.  Here we follow a future protagonist as he ventures out into the ups and downs of the brave new world in his new high tech car, the Kamakiri.  A decently interesting concept if not particularly compelling, but one that comes across as a much less personal affair this go round.  Though Fagen's songs would never likely be described as sweet, there was a certain sweetness to \\"The Nightfly\\" that wasn't present before or after that album and which gave it an extra emotional connection.  The songs themselves on \\"Kamakiriad\\" are consistently good, and they are smooth as silk and groove admirably.  In fact, they may groove just a little too hard.  A listen to the album in its entirety causes the songs to begin to sound a little homogeneous compared to those of \\"The Nightfly,\\" where each song was uniquely and melodically memorable, told a story, captured a specific emotion, and really transported the listener to Fagen's innocent fantasy life.  It's a tougher challenge to actually remember the songs on \\"Kamakiriad\\" and distinguish one funky groove from the next.<br />My review may sound negative but it really isn't.  \\"Kamakiriad\\" is certainly a very enjoyable album - well performed, well produced, and offering fans a healthy dose of Fagen's unique soulful songcraft.  A classic, however, it is not.  That status remains reserved for his solo debut.  We know Fagen has it in him to give us something really really special, but this time around we gladly settle for very good.performed, well produced, and offering fans a healthy dose of Fagen's unique soulful songcraft.

B00006J9OT|5.0|I bought this CD on the recommendation of a friend and also after watching clips of her performance on YouTube. After listening to it, I gotta say it's brilliant. The recording is fantastic as is her performance. Love her arrangement of Billy Joel's \\"Just the Way You Are\\" as well. I have went on to purchase the DVD of this concert as well.

B002VECM6S|5.0|Sandra was amazing. This movie is highly recommended. Great family film based on a true story.
0321544080|5.0|I am a big fan of Joe McNally.  His \\"Hot Shoe Diaries\\" was a great read and this book has the same flavor of Joe's personality.  When you read books about photography your first inclination is to try and understand how to technically produce the same photographic results, mostly in a technical manner.  This is not a good approach and will not give you what you desire. I have read so many comments here about how the book will not give you all of the steps towards producing these images.  Why should it?  If you read a book about The Beatles, do you want to write Twist and Shout?  It's been done. Simple as it sounds you can like someone else's work but they already did it.  Get over it.  The whole point is to become inspired to go out and create your own work. If you are a painter do you think that you will be congratulated for doing a nice job with a paint by number kit?   The point of reading books by artists is to feel the inspiration behind the work and gain some insight into the process of thinking which leads to producing great work and in some cases, sellable work.  As a professional photographer myself, my job is to always look for things that inspire me. But the only way to create good shots is to find your own way and do your own experimenting.  Playing the cello along with a YoYo Ma recording will not make you a great cellist.  You have to do your own practicing.  You have to learn your scales, chords, intonation, styles, and all of the elements of making music.  When you come across a situation that offers a challenge, you need your own skills in order to manage the situation.  You can't carry a handful of books in your camera bag.  But, you can read this one and become inspired to go out and start \\"seeing\\" and \\"doing\\".  Joe's books make it that much more enticing.  When he tells his stories you can feel the excitement of the process.  That's the idea in my opinion.
B000IB0E8O|5.0|Although not one of my favorite Steve Hackett albums, the remastered edition of Highly Strung does much to make the music clearer, and with that it is now possible to hear many nuances in songs I once thought were somewhat bland or not very interesting. Sadly, one of the bonus tracks, \\"Time Lapse at Milton Keynes,\\" is available elsewhere (or at least it doesn't sound much different than the version on Bay of Kings). The other two, and extended version of \\"Walking through Walls\\" and a rockabilly tune \\"Guitar Boogie,\\" have some interesting moments. Overall, the remaster is a good album.
B002HHPVHQ|5.0|A Colossal Failure of Common Sense is an amazing recollection of both facts and people's attitudes in the lead up not only to Lehman's failure but it also gets right to the heart of the Global Banking Crisis. Larry G McDonald \\"tells it as it was\\" and for anyone now involved in any large Investment Banking business, or indeed any Govt Treasury/Regulatory Dept, it is a must read.  Experienced Bankers will say \\"well i knew that\\".Some may also well reflect that \\"those so and so's in the Credit Dept were actually right\\"!However those prepared to admit this will be few and far between as not many Banks put risk assessment before the golden rewards.  It is also a fascinating insight to blinkered and power crazy senior management -  Fuld and Gregory - and a master lesson in what is NOT the role of a Board and NXD's.  Personally i find it difficult to believe that the NXD's did not question the strategy of Lehman's more obviously and more so that the whole Banking community supporting Lehman's Balance Sheet did not see through the obvious flaws in the business - Management and model - much earlier.  A visit to Stockdale should be the reward in any competition for aspiring young Investment bankers.
B00393R1ZC|5.0|I got an email from MTV that they released The Complete series of Daria on DVD! Wow! I couldn't believe that something I watched in high school was finally released! It's eight disks inside one container, good for not taking up much space in your dvd collection. I heard that it took a while for them to make the series on DVD because of the many copy right laws regarding the music that originally was on the show. I've watched it and it's always a great comic relief! Of course I'm a big fan, so it's a 10 out of 10 for me.

B002E01LL6|3.0|I seriously don't know why this film is called Fighting. Its more of a love story. In all honesty. Three-fourths of the film was love and there was a big fight at the end for 100,000. And through out the movie...there was only like 3 fights. Most of the time Channing Tatum's character was thinking about some girl with a kid and he wants to fight for money to get her outta debt. Overall, as  a Channing Tatum fan...its not worth the hype. =/

B003C1QIO6|5.0|This album reaches towards a formula that drew in a good number of Jack Johnson's fans.  Songs that are upbeat, with lots of love and can take you on a short melodic journey.  It's not quite the same, there are a lot of band compilations (piano, bass, harmonica) and backup vocals here and there.  But those are strengths in this album.    The backup vocals meld wonderfully: some with a soothing ladies voice, used seldomly; and then the ever present voice of Zach Gill (piano, accordion) singing along.  This guy is amazing and I hope there are songs in the future where both Johnson and Gill are represented.  I can't wait to see these guys in concert, for Jack Johnson's music and Zach's performance.. he really has fun.  I saw a concert video with both of them performing ALO's \\"Girl I Wanna Lay You Down,\\"  and have wished for a duo song ever since.  That brings me to \\"Red Wine, Mistakes, Mythology.\\" A fun and rampant song with a lot of ALO influence and Zach's voice boasting in the chorus, bring on more please!      I keep hearing comments about Jack Johnson's simple lyrics.  I'm guessing this leans more towards simple being the number of words used or the high use of metaphors.  Maybe how smooth his lyrics tend to come across, I'm not really sure.  But the lyrics are one of the main reasons he's my favorite artist.  They burst with meaning for me and I can't wait to learn and ponder about this new set of lyrics.    Some of these songs have classic rocks elements in them, all the while staying folksy and soft rock.. yet avoid being pop.  My favorites are, No Good With Faces; To the Sea; Red Wine, Mistakes, Mythology; The Upsetter.  It's very hard to pick.  It's funny, all of my favorite Jack Johnson songs I have never heard on the radio.  Anyways I'm tired at this late hour, but extremely happy with these new melodies to listen too.
0446567337|3.0|This book was very predictable. But worth a read. I really wanted to read the book before I watched the movie but I not only was disappointed with the movie, I was also disappointed with this book. I wanted a change and it seems like more of Nicholas Sparks' books are becoming more and more predicable.     I highly recommend his new book called The Last Song. Not only was the book the best book ever, but the movie was amazing! Miley is a very talented actress!
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|The Black Parade is definitely my favorite album of the last decade and is trying to fight for my favorite album of all time. The music is so catchy and memorable that I can listen to it over and over again and it just gets better with age. Another cool thing is that my favorite song of the album changes all of the time. Every song is just so good that I can't decide which is my favorite. It also has one of the most depressing and emotional songs I have ever heard (Cancer)and I mean that in a good way. The lyrics and music just touch something deep inside and is something we can relate to. The album in its entirety just really works. Definitely worth buying
0375507256|4.0|I'm enjoying the book, well written, but my comment relates to quality assurance in the Kindle edition I am reading on my iPad. I can't imagine the printed book is in this kind of shape, so I assume there is a big problem with the conversion process to ebook format. There are literally thousands of missing periods, word spaces, and commas, several per \\"page,\\" along with many spurious line breaks. I've been reading past these, but when sentences are run together I often have to slow down to sort the missing punctuation. THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. The printed book is about the same price; I'd recommend you get that instead. Complaint filed with Random House, for all the good I expect that will do.
B001EO748M|5.0|aawesome. i love this show. im sad it only lasted 4 seasons.  this show is the story of king henry the 8th and his battles with the the king of portugal, france, his multiple marriages, and his desparate need for a son.  this show is historically accurate in many ways and is a lot of fun to watch. however you must watch this show in order.  this is one of showtimes best. be warned that this show does have offer a lot of nudity.  season 2 is all about king henry and his desire to divorce queen catherine and get his kingdome to accept his new queen anne boyelyn, and how it all falls apart.

B0035G5IOE|5.0|FANTASTIC MR. FOX<br /><br />STARRING: The Voices of: George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Eric Chase Anderson, Wallace Wolodarsky, Wes Anderson, Michael Gambon, Helen McCrory, Adrien Brody and Willem Dafoe<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach; based on the novel by Roald Dahl<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Wes Anderson<br /><br />Rated: PG<br />Genre: Animation / Comedy<br />Release Date: 25 November 2009<br /><br />Up was a really good movie, but the Oscar for best animated film belonged to Fantastic Mr. Fox. It should have also relieved Up for its slot in the top 10 best films of the year. I've never seen anything like it. The animation was spectacular as was the film in its entirety. It's smart, hilarious and brilliantly acted by everyone; George Clooney in particular. It's like Ocean's Eleven, but with animals, you see.<br /><br />I have never read the famous children's book by Roald Dahl, but am dying to, having seen the film twice now. Screenwriter and director Wes Anderson's work may just be among the most unique in Hollywood, and this is my favorite of his films, hands down. Any guy, who puts Owen Wilson in virtually every film, is OK in my book.<br /><br />Fantastic Mr. Fox is shot in stop animation and it's the best film I've ever seen in this style. From the sets, to the characters, to the outfits they are wearing; everything was given the minutest detail and it really shows itself off throughout the film. It may be PG, and it may be based on a children's book, and it may be animated, but Fantastic Mr. Fox is every bit as much for adults as it is for kids, if not more so. The characters at times use profanity, but rather than say the actual swear words out loud, they are cleverly replaced with the word, `cuss.' At one point in the film one of them says, \\"Are you cussing with me?\\"<br /><br />George Clooney stars as the voice of Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep voices his wife, Mrs. Fox. Their son Ash is voiced by the hilarious Jason Schwartzman and all three of them are phenomenal. Bill Murray is in here too as a badger who is an attorney and of course you can catch Owen Wilson as Ash's coach, Skip.<br /><br />Mr. Fox has retired from his thrill of stealing chickens, as he made a promise to do so to Mrs. Fox, at the news that she was pregnant. Several years later however, he has once again taken an interest in the excitement of stealing chickens, and may hold some slight resentment to his son Ash, for being the reason he had to give up on his passion.<br /><br />This is shown primarily by the way Mr. Fox does little to encourage Ash, who is short for his age and considered to be somewhat of an outcast. He's `different' - whatever that word means in today's society.<br /><br />Things get worse for poor little Ash, when the prized child of the family, his cousin Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson), comes to stay with them. Mr. Fox seems to be completely in the dark to the fact that he favors Kristofferson in his physical abilities in sporting activities, to those of his son Ash.<br /><br />Ash definitely notices this, and he notices when the girl at school he has a crush on, takes a liking to Kristofferson. One of my favorite moments in the film is where Ash gives Kristofferson a guilt trip about not wanting to sleep on the floor of his room by saying, \\"Oh you going to put about it? Because I've had it up to here with the sad house guest routine!\\" Schwartzman's delivery is priceless.<br /><br />Mr. Fox is enthralled with Kristofferson's athletic agility. When he has mastered up the perfect plan to get himself back into the game of chicken stealing, he brings his nephew along. Mr. Fox will strategically break into the chicken factories of three notorious rich men in town. The fact that his plan may backfire, never crosses his mind.<br /><br />There is some suspense to be had, especially when he learns that one of them is being guarded by one of Mr. Fox's long forgotten enemies; Rat, played by Willem Dafoe. Great scenes here as well folks. Before Mr. Fox knows it, his entire family is in danger because of his lying and selfishness and it's up to him to save everyone, and hopefully learn a lesson or two in the process.<br /><br />The film is so much, you simply can't miss it. There are some moments that may scare younger kids, as at times the animals are, well - animalistic, in nature. Especially the way they eat. In addition to this, they look very real, and there are several close-ups of their furry faces that will leave you breathless.<br /><br />Fantastic Mr. Fox is littered with laughs throughout - the kind that escape unexpectedly and boisterously. It's fun for everyone and kids will be entertained and pick up on the lessons the film feeds them: stealing is wrong, lying is wrong and family is what matters most. Just like this film, it's fantastic!entire family is in danger because of his lying and selfishness and it's up to him to save everyone, and hopefully learn a lesson or two in the process.

B00025ETIW|4.0|Three Cheers is my least favorite album of the three released so far, but the album is still great anyway. The only reason I say it is my least favorite is because I can listen to Bullets and Black Parade without skipping songs, but I tend to skip around when I listen to this album. There are just a few songs that I don't care for. Overall, even if I say that this album isn't my favorite, it is still an amazing record and is definitely worth getting.
B001HN694K|4.0|I saw ALICE in 3D in an IMAX theatre. This being said, viewers can expect a mildly odd family entertainment, best made memorable by a lackluster performance from Johnny Depp. Once again, Depp dons his generic British accent that while believable, is unvaried from his other Brit roles- of which he's had a few. I feel comfortable being critical of the genius that Depp most certainly is- now that he's made enough money to retire 20 times over. He's going to have to work very hard indeed to top his previous Burton collaborations. Hopefully we will all forget Willy Wonka from the formidable list of triumphs.    Unlike the wonderland of AVATAR, Burton's Wonderland seems somewhat unfinished, as if there were insufficient time or monies to satisfy his vision. Burton's Wonderland is not only bleak, but lacking in detail and imagination.    All of this is relatively unimportant. ALICE is in its own way a respectable work of art which, for a Hollywood blockbuster, was no easy credential. Clearly, Burton knows the ins and outs of working Tinseltown. Few art films in history and fewer film makers have commanded this kind of strong-legged boxoffice.    In spite of a nice 3D eyefest made nicer indeed by the IMAX format, this ALICE is neither \\"trippy\\", profound, or for that matter, truly entertaining. But hey, I own stock in both Disney and IMAX so I know the smell of big bucks when I get a whiff.    Ultimately, I've passed on owning this DVD. The film is simply not memorable enough to hold up to, or command repeat viewings (unless one is chemically enhanced to grok anything with groooovy images). And I am the kind of guy who collects Disney animation. I find it ironic indeed that Tim Burton, who came into his own by rejecting the Mouse Factory, has won a hit for himself at Disney. There- I guess Disney has been well compensated for providing Tim's apprenticeship.     I found ALICE to be an engaging, but ultimately unsatisfying addition to Burton's Filmography. I have no doubt thatBurton himself is dissapointed with this WONDERLAND. Nevertheless, ALICE IN WONDERLAND accomplished what it set out to do, namely, make a lot of money for all parties involved.
0783225482|5.0|Death Becomes Her / 0783225482    *Spoilers*    This dark comedy from my youth is still one of my favorites. Streep, Hawn, and Willis all deliver a star performance, and while the humor is always at the forefront - and will have you screaming with laughter - the underlying story is surprisingly deep. And while the movie doesn't particularly shy away from the point, it's a rare film that manages to bring the point front and center without beating the watcher over the head with it. \\"Death Becomes Her\\" flirts deeply and skillfully with the problems of aging and mortality, and manages to come to a conclusion that most of us often cannot accept - that a deathless life is without reason, but even a short life with friends and loved ones has meaning and endless depth.     ~ Ana Mardoll
B003HARV7A|2.0|It has been years since I first saw this movie on DVD and while I will never argue it is a good movie, I can't help but laugh at all the \\"reviewers\\" here who claim the movie made them laugh.   Methinks they doth pretend to \\"laugh\\" too much!  Most reviewers here sound like hypocrites to me.   Any man who claims he watched this movie for any reason other than to see lots of female skin is a liar, or gay.  Or both.  I know that is why I watched it, and I was not disappointed.  Ms. Berkely has a fantastic body and Ms. Gershon looked wonderful herself.  IMO, reviewers who claim they laughed at the bad acting are just being disingenuous - I think they are just trying to cover up the fact that THEY LOVED THIS MOVIE FOR ALL THE SEX AND BEAUTIFUL NAKED BODIES!   And lumping it in with such trash as \\"Planet Nine\\" is just silly.   It may not be a good movie but it was competently directed and acted, and IMO well worth watching for what it was if you are a normal heterosexual male.   As for all those  would-be cinema auteurs who want to have their cake and eat it too, I highly recommend they see \\"Dancing at the Blue Iguana,\\" a truly wonderful movie with fantastic acting, great directing and an outstanding script - and oh yes, almost as much skin as \\"Showgirls.\\"

Daniel Day Lewis is a pleasure to watch and listen to, but where the hell was this movie headed?<br />It wasted time on visual scenes that did nothing to advance the movie or a character (the oil rig fire), and then jumped years ahead to his \\"son's\\" wedding without filling in the gaps.<br />The Planview character (Lewis) was the only one the movie tried to advance, but it didn't even do that well.<br />If this movie was suppose to teach us something; I sure can't figure out what it was. And the ending.......did they just run out of film or what?

B001HN69B8|3.0|When you name a review \\"baffling\\" and it's by Terry Gilliam, most people who are familiar with his movies, would claim that as a pre requisite.<br />I say it in two ways, first and foremost how you could get Christopher Plummer, Heath Ledger, Johnny Depp, Jude Law AND Colin Farrell in the same movie and be moved to indifference for the first hour of this movie.<br />Secondly, it's baffling because it's really quite weird. That's not a complaint as such, as I said in the introduction, one can hardly call Terry Gilliam mainstream.<br />Indeed, in todays fast buck mega pictures out to ream cash from the masses, it's refreshing to still see a filmmaker, who has the money (and the courage) to interpret on screen, what most of us confine to our nighttime dreams.<br />Oversimplifying the film would be to say that the Devil (played with more than a dollop of dark charm by Tom Waits) as \\"Mr Nick\\" made a deal, or bet in an undisclosed distant past, with monk Christopher Plummer who gained immortality in the wager.<br />Now years later, he runs a tin pan side show, where people can visit their \\"dreams\\" by stepping through his mirror (while he controls it with a trance) and he can help them shape their own world, and save their soul. Mr Nick in the meantime, usually appears in their dream world with a more appealing alternative (but worse conclusion) and the too and fro for souls, as you get the impression, has been battled out between them.<br />Plummer, now an aged drunk has a soon to be 16 year old daughter Valentina (played with a pale but almost sexy fragility by Lily Cole) and a zealous apprentice Anton, again played amiably by another newcomer Andrew Garfield, and long standing advisor Vern Troyer (Austin Powers).<br />We learn that in one of the two protagonists \\"deals\\" at some point, Parnassus (Plummer) fell in love, and had a child, which he must hand over to Mr Nick on her rapidly approaching 16th birthday, unless he can win a new \\"bet\\".<br />Enter Heath Ledger, as an amnesiac apparent suicide victim, saved by our wandering troupe, who signs on to help Parnassus and company, reach the public, win the bet, and woo the daughter, much to the chagrin of Anton who has yet to announce his undying love to Valentina.<br />Sounds interesting? Yes it does, and I had high hopes, not only to see Legder in his last performance, but I had also been more than impressed by the glitzy high profile trailer.<br />But it's dull, I'm sorry but trudges through the first hour and in attempting to conjure up many visions of Parnassuses World, ends up a mess.<br />There isn't any real tension even when the story gets going, Depp, Law, and Farrell are nothing more than wasted cameos, and even the twist at the end, isn't really gripping. By two hours in, I had lost any real compassion for any of the characters.<br /><br />I have long been a fan of Terry Gilliam, I thoroughly enjoyed the Brothers Grimm, and Brazil, but frankly this is not in that league.<br />If you like bizarre out there movies, give it a go by all means.<br />I didn't want to be mean, but 3 stars was as generous as I could be.im, saved by our wandering troupe, who signs on to help Parnassus and company, reach the public, win the bet, and woo the daughter, much to the chagrin of Anton who has yet to announce his undying love to Valentina.

0307588335|5.0|From 2003 to late 2006 I was fresh out of college working for a couple independent investment banks. Not dissimilar from the bucket shops Larry McDonald describes in the early chapters of the book. As part of the overall financial planning services we also originated thousands of stated mortgages. The mortgage banker at the head of our firm was good friends with Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo. Lehman Brothers took our paper and packaged it hand over fist. The no-doc, neg am, alt stuff -whatever it was Lehman had an outlet for it. A Colossal Failure of Common Sense crystallized for me exactly who was on the other side of the transactions all those years. Ironically, the brokerage firm that my family worked out of collapsed on a huge margin call from retail client accounts who were sold odd lots of CMO's - illiquid and unsuitable for all but the most liquid of institutional investors.    McDonald described New Century and other bad actors just perfectly - body builders. I hung out with these guys, we surfed together, partied together, tried to one up each other in frivolous purchases. It was a time disconnected from reality and common sense. We were just riding a wave of liquidity and debt. Our interaction with the toxicity started with a rate lock and ended with closing signatures or so we thought. McDonald's blow by blow account of the Lehman collapse made me feel sick to my stomach with guilt in many ways. I recall a spirited discussion I had with a Countrywide manager over a few cocktails at the 2006 Christmas Party at Spagos in Beverly Hills. By then there were sub prime defaults and I began to ask worst case scenario questions, the what-if questions that bankers used to ask before underwriting. By the end of the conversation the manager confided that in any of \\"those\\" situations Fannie/Freddie or the US government would ultimately have to provide some type of subsidy.    I felt a common frustration to McDonald as a prisoner within my own organization. If I wantedto keep up the standard of living I enjoyed I needed to preform. That meant closing loans, marketing more mortgage debt and continuing to be part of the problem. Reading A Colossal Failure of Common Sense was catharsis. The detailed iterations of McDonald's psyche are most powerful. Knowing that other fair minded people within Lehman Brothers could see the writing on the wall, were compelled to voice upper management and yet ultimately became props - completely powerless - allowed me to move past the guilt and on to fairer dealing elsewhere.    A Colossal Failure of Common sense is a cautionary story about excessive leverage, toxic management silos and corporate malfeasance. There are many reasons to read this book, but chief among them is the very fact that other reviewers are critical of: the insider's irrelevancy. Armed with a cheer leading board of directors and management committee, the top brass at Lehman were able to brush back any concerns from the outside. If so many within the building at 745 7th Ave were completely powerless in the end what does that say about the thousands of junior debt holders or millions of preferred and common shareholders outside the shiny glass and hologram facade?     A Colossal Failure of Common Sense is requiem for corporate governance reform. Read this book.

B001DDBCUK|3.0|I brought the 2-disc movie.  I liked it, but I think there was not enough Sex in the movie.    I also have a habit of backing up things on my PC.  And sadly, even though I backed up the Digital Copy disc and it still played through the early part of this year, it no longer plays now.    I should have rated this four stars. But, WB's decision to end offers on the digital copy of this movie made me dock one star off the rating.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|There has been confusion and debate, mysteries answered and some, forever lost. But this is the end of Lost and all that matters is if you are satisfied with the entire journey. I certainly was. There is too much to discuss and explain that could ever fit into a proper review. But I would say that the 6th and final season of Lost is the greatest since the first season. Through every episode you wonder how it will all end, if everything will be explained. Some may be dissapointed to find that the latter is not the case. But in a show this complex, can everything really be properly explained? There have been flaws and a few pointless episodes throughout the entire series, but in the end, it doesn't matter. Because the end is beautiful and morose at the same time. It all makes sense, as strange as that sounds, and it wraps up solemnly and quietly, and though you wish it could go on forever and ever, you realize, this is the perfect way to end it. Will there be another show like this? Nobody knows, and I feel that people will still be trying to digest this series for many years to come. This is certainly a shows that bears re-watching, which may actually be a good idea for those still utterly confused. Simply a great finale to a wonderful show!

Of course we all want to read about our favorite POV characters (Tyrion, Jon Snow, Dany, etc.) but this book is still very interesting and fun.  Not as exciting as the other books but still very solid.  Samwell's story is very interesting and so is the Iron Born story.  The parts at King's Landing are a bit dry but they end wonderful.  I just hope GRRM finishes the next book soon.  It's killing me and a lot of other people too.

Now imagine him growing up and marrying a WOMAN!    What are the chances you get to keep said album after your mother sees tracks listed as \\"Dirty Mind\\", \\"Do It All Night\\", \\"Head\\" and \\"Sister\\"? Thank God it was a month later and I had a sweet pair of Radio Shack 42lb. headphones! Honestly, what kind of awesome parellel universe do we live in when an artist receives critical acclaim for penning lyrics discussing in graphic detail receiving oral and boning one's family member?!    So you may be wondering how this affected me long term, yes? Check it...Mike Tyson, in the prime of his career, and me, Bobby, Jay (HI JAY!) and Jim are looking for a bar to watch him once again beat the bag out of some faceless clown. What better way to prime the pugilistic pump than to play the 1-2 punch of Head/Sister? Better yet, then set to 'repeat' the classic lyric \\"Oh motherf..r, can't you ever motherf..g understand??!!\\" (editted because this is a family site). If that doesn't make you want fight I don't know what does!    Quite possibly the best 2 songs ever laid down on wax back to back, with the possible exception of \\"Wanna Girl\\" and \\"The Right Kind Of Love\\" by Jeremy Jordan. Bobby of course will probably mentioned some obscure tracks from Joshua Tree or October, by U2 since he went through this phase at Babson where he actually \\"thought\\" he WAS Bono! That of course all come down in a fiery crash one Halloween in Salem when someone mistook him for Ritchie Sambora!! Hahaha!!! Massive burn! When me and Jay dress up as Nelson of all things and get mad respect from the ladies, well....
0385341008|5.0|Everyone should read this book. I didn't think there was anything new to say about WWII, but this beautiful, bittersweet story proved me wrong. The writing is nuanced and understated, giving new meaning to the literary goal of showing, not telling. This book gives a lot of credit to the reader to make their own conclusions. As sweet as it is, it avoids being overly saccharine by showing the devesting effects of war as well as the friendship of the society members.  It is unendingly compassionate, and the narrative through letters only enhances what is wonderful about this story- you see inside each characters psyche, you can tell how each has been effected by war and its aftermath.  It's one of those books I'll remember forever. Not to give anything away, but when I saw what the fate of Elizabeth and Christian was, it broke my heart completely.  They may have become my favorite fictional love story of all time.

0385504225|3.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's novels and consider myself a fan of his work.  In my opinion his small body of work ranks among some of the better airport fiction out there (now that Crichton is gone).  It's true that his novels rely on the same formula and are now somewhat easy to predict, but his heavy use of history, mysterious organizations, etc. are enough to keep you interested (and overlook his fantastical use of psuedo-science).      The Lost Symbol falls short of his previous work, perhaps it is the continuation of the same aged formula, but I think the paper-thin plot is more to blame.  Overall it seems less likely, and it is definitely less consequential than previous plots.  Amongst his other work I would rate this as my least favorite.  Still a worthy read if you are a fan, but definitely not as a Dan Brown primer.

B001PHTPDU|5.0|Klein's book is a solid and invaluable study of \\"economic shock therapy\\" (sudden privatization removal of all trade barriers, accompanied by drastic reductions in taxes and social spending) over the past three decades. She concludes that economic shock therapy (originally formulated by economist Milton Friedman) cannot be implemented without a preceding crisis (eg. hyperinflation (eg. Chile, Bolivia), weather disasters (eg. Katrina or the 2004 tsunami in South Asia), war (eg. 9/11, Iraq War II), or major political upset (eg. the Soviet Union after Gorbachev's resignation), and requires suppression of dissent to succeed. The \\"really bad news\\" is that each example cited by Klein quickly led to massive economic worsening for the general populace. Worse yet, is Friedman's statement that \\"our (true free-market enthusiasts) basic function is to develop alternatives to existing policies, and to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.\\" Worst of all, is a suspicion that the current administration is committed to bringing about such crises if they don't naturally occur.<br /><br />Friedman first learned to exploit large-scale crisis in the mid-70s while acting as advisor to Chile's General Pinochet following his violent 1074 coup. Tax cuts, free trade, privatized services, cuts in social spending, deregulation, voucher-funded private schools quickly followed. Torture cells and mass murders stifled dissent. Unemployment went from 3 to 20% (ultimately 30% in 1982), and thousands of business foundered. Eventually Pinochet was forced to rescind much of what had been done, and Chile began recovering - mainly thanks to its government copper mines that had not been privatized. A lasting result, however, that in 2007, Chileans had the 8th most unequal income distribution.<br /><br />Russia's Yeltsin wasted no time after Gorbachev's 10/91 resignation, and in his first week announced lifting price controls (70% opposed), free trade policies, and the beginning of rapid privatization of the nation's 225,000 state-owned companies. Parliament agreed to give Yeltsin free rein for a year. At the end of that period the economy had fallen 40%, and rising opposition prompted Yeltsin to disband Parliament and back up his decrees with military rule and arrests. A small group of oligarchs managed to use government monies deposited in their just-created banks to buy vast national assets at fire-sale prices - eg. 51% of one oil company went for $130 million, only to be valued two years later at $2.8 billion. (Only Russians were allowed ownership.) These oligarchs then supported Yeltsin with large donations and heavy media coverage - 800X that of his rivals. Despite winning the election, Yeltsin's approval rating fell to 6%, and by '98, over 80% of Russian farms were bankrupt, those living in poverty rose from 2 million to 74 million in 8 years, the population declined 10%, etc.<br /><br />Undeterred, reformers' next stop was Iraq. This time, U.S. firms would be the first in line for the anticipated easy billions. Bremer spent most of his first four months almost exclusively on economic matters - privatizing everything in sight (except oil - was warned that to do so would create enormous resistance), lowering the corporate tax rate from 45 to 15%, allowing foreign companies to own 100% of Iraqi assets and take out 100% of the profits, and cementing deals with 40-year leases and contracts. Meanwhile, de-Baathification removed skilled people from their posts, weakened the voice of secular Iraqis, and fed the resistance - already red hot from Bremer's having dismissed the entire 400,000 man Iraqi army. Unemployment, already high, rose even more. Then, it was on to rewrite the Iraq constitution to cement these changes - this succeeded at first, but opposition led to a second rewriting where these changes were lost.<br /><br />Only 15,000 Iraqis were hired for reconstruction projects under Bremer; meanwhile, American companies made billions, aided by 20-50% overheads that incorporated multiple levels of contracting to share the wealth with Kuwaitis and Saudis.<br /><br />As for U.S. government waste - no problem! Our decaying infrastructure becomes an opportunity to turn additional areas over to private enterprise, companies like Blackwater ($950/day to guard FEMA staff and facilities during Katrina) and Custer Battles provide a solid source of on-going Republican-party donations. Iraq War expenditures and tax cuts provide motivation for standing against children's' health care funding.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to \\"benefit\\" from expanded free trade just like Chile, Bolivia, Poland, Russia, and Iraq have done - with increased income inequality and lower standards of living.lions, aided by 20-50% overheads that incorporated multiple levels of contracting to share the wealth with Kuwaitis and Saudis.

0812973992|2.0|I had very high hopes based on the reviews, but was left unimpressed. The book is very disjointed, following too many different characters, and the end result is that you do not care for any of them. That's not to say that none of these characters could have been engrossing -- it's just that they are relegated to x pages and then you're on to the next. The fates of the characters are somewhat tied together at the end, as expected, but the road traveled to get to that junction is very long and tedious.

B0009SOFGI|5.0|Heard this at a friend's house and ordered it that day.  Up to now, I've only been able to listen to this on the original vinyl without puking--the Elektra CD is that bad.  This remaster is very good: you can hear Iggy's voice and tell how young he is and you can hear the nuances in all the songs (which sound dull and repetitive on the Elektra CD).  Maybe most important, they included all of Ron Asheton's guitar solos here, which makes this a must buy, even if you're a vinyl freak with the original in decent condition.  And the John Cale mixes are interesting, much better in my opinion than most of the reviewers here say.      As to the album itself, if you don't know it, well . . . just listen to the Amazon sampler of \\"Now I wanna be your dog\\"--it'll only play you the instrumental lead in, which should be enough.  I dare you to name a better, hotter lead than that, ever, except maybe Chuck Berry on \\"Johnny B. Good.\\"  Everybody talks about how the Stooges were punk before punk on this album and metal before metal on Raw Power and free jazz/rock fusion on Fun House, which was recorded before the Stones' Exile on Main Street.  All true, but so what.  Get this album (buy all three, actually) because the band was fantastic: hot, tight, powerful, as hard-core as it will ever get.  You'll never hear anybody play or sing with more conviction than this.  In the end that's what counts, and what should last.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This is a no-frills DVD. The movie starts, it plays, it ends. There are no \\"extras.\\"<br /><br />But, we knew that going in. James Cameron said that in order to really get the highest quality image, given the massive length of the movie, he had to use all of the room on the DVD (disk) for the movie. I will buy into that, until I see if that holds true in the forthcoming \\"enhanced DVD\\" due out later this year. But for now, the detail is nice, the quality is superb, and the movie is as fun as ever. This is of course NOT 3-D or Blue Ray, or anything fancy, but the visuals are still stunning.<br /><br />Okay, so what can I say about the movie that I haven't already said on Radio Avatar (the unofficial podcast of the Avatar movie: find it at [...]) or on the [...] forums? The story is your typical boy grows up to be a US Marine, trains in Recon, fights in the jungle, gets his spine \\"blowed-up\\" and ends up on a distant planet in a wheel chair movie. (and that is just in the first 3 minutes!) What makes this movie different from any other war/sci-fi movie is the layers and layers of meaning and inference woven together by the storyteller (JC) in a way that truly relates \\"a fair telling of the story.\\" A lot of what you don't see in the movie is revealed in the accompanying book (sadly, not included with the DVD) \\"The Activist's Survival Guide\\" [[ASIN:0061896756 Avatar: A Confidential Report on the Biological and Social History of Pandora (James Cameron's Avatar)]] or ASG. It paints a pretty beak picture of life on Earth at the time of the movie, and is almost sympathetic to the vast RDA corporation we see in the movie representing the human interest.<br /><br />This movie is a clash of civilizations. It is more than technology (and the isolation it implies) versus a deep-spiritual connection with the world around you. It is about the choices we make in life, and how those choices are based on our perceptions of reality. Jake Sully (our hero) is a fish-out-of-water, thrust into a world of scientists who can no more understand the world around them than the corporate execs whose job it is to tear up the place and extract valuable minerals. His perspective of reality is what drives the story. His ability to exist in two worlds bridges them into a fusion of action until it reaches a breaking point. At this point of the trilogy, disharmony is the only answer. The two have not learned yet to coexist. Will they ever? We will just have to wait for JC to tell us. But in this installment, we have a complete story of how one civilization invades another, disrupting the balance of nature--and nature fights back. (oopsie!)<br /><br />Strong environmentalist messages, some anti-\\"unrestrained capitalism\\" sentiment, oh, and yes, PAGAN ceremonies. Don't watch if you have a heart condition and are intolerant of other's belief systems.<br /><br />As always, Thanks for reading.who can no more understand the world around them than the corporate execs whose job it is to tear up the place and extract valuable minerals.

B002TZS5GU|3.0|This was a well done post-apocalyptic film about a small group of virus survivors and their interactions with a limited number of other survivors. The production values were high and the acting at the very least, good enough.  The story was good too, albeit one that has been played out numerous times in what are probably better films.  However, the movie is certainly worth a watch if you're a fan of this genre.  Just be aware this is not an uplifting movie; there are far too many humanistic reflections for this to be a fun/lighthearted movie.  Not that that's a bad thing, just be aware before you make your rent/buy decision.
B00275EGWY|1.0|I tried really hard to get into this film. It was beautifully shot and the acting was good as well. I had a hard time discerning the point and felt the story was weak.
B000001ZS4|5.0|I believe this was Jean Michel Jarre's follow up to \\"Oxygene\\". I find it also smooth and relaxing, useful as background music. It moves seamlessly from song to song almost as if he was putting music to dreams. Using only synthsizer music, Mr. Jarre makes the album talk to you without a single spoken word, amazing. I plan on buying more of his albums to see where else his music can take me.
B00275EHIW|5.0|I really liked this movie, I will go to the theater to see it again and I will buy it on DVD. Many people have pointed out the basics, but I wanted to point out the things that made this such a good film for me.<br /><br />The lead characters looked really good and have great onscreen chemistry. I never really thought of Jake as super sexy before this film, but that buff body, long dark hair, big blue eyes and wicked smile were stunning. (He should have left his hair long after filming). I cried twice during the movie. That is how invested I felt in these two.<br /><br />I liked the moral message about letting your heart guide you to doing what is right, no matter what others are saying. This ruffian thief brought heart to the royal family and I liked that.<br /><br />I love good CGI and this film's CGI was outstanding. Not once did I see something that stood out as fake or poorly done. This movie is based off an action adventure game with a character that jumps, twirls and slides. That is exactly what they gave us.<br /><br />Some people keep comparing it to Pirates of the Caribbean and saying it is lacking because the Johnny Depp humor wasn't their. I don't think this movie was meant to be anything like that film. This lead character is a ruffian, but not a fool. To have given this film a character that couldn't be taken seriously, would have taken the heart away from it. I actually preferred this film over the Pirates films. Don't get me wrong, I really liked them, but they were dark and I never felt invested in their characters. Good acting in the Pirates, but not a lot of chemistry, which Prince or Persia has.<br /><br />Not one minute during this movie was I bored. The action really makes this a go see on screen film, not a wait until dvd one.
B000001ZS3|5.0|I was 1st exposed to the work of Jean Michel Jarre in the 80's. I've enjoyed it since. Its great \\"background\\" music. I don't think it is meant to offer any moral message (it has no dialogue or words) as much as just relaxing music. I enjoy it in the car while driving. You won't sing to it, but you will remember it.
B0036EH3XE|4.0|Who knew after 6 years the show would endure 6 seasons? You'd think in the last season they would reveal a butt load of answers to the mysteries that have plagued hard core detective fans of Lost, but alas not everything get's tided up nicely. But the writers of Lost wouldn't have it any other way. Sure they do reveal questions about the Island, the Smoke Monster, and why they came to the Island, but does ever little mystery get reveal? The Answer is a resounding \\"No,\\" the point of Lost is not just the mysteries, but the characters that the viewer has learned to love and hate. The season is full of action, death of main characters, love, redemption, and homecoming. And by the end I'm sure you'll be moved to tears.
0810979772|5.0|my grandchildren loved this . They have devoted much time to trying to complete it.Much better than video games or tv.It requires some reading and thought and I certainly don't feel guilty about using it as a babysitter.Can't wait for them to read it five or ten years from now
B002SJIO5E|5.0|My friends who have seen this film told me it was perfect for me, that I would love it, but it took me a while to buy it. Here in Brazil it is too expensive so I waited until prices were more affordable here at Amazon. Now I can only say fantastic, very well produced, great script, excellent special effects. Totally recommended.
B0026IYJEM|5.0|I decided to watch \\"one disc\\" of Mad Men to see what all the fuss was about.  I waited a couple days and HAD TO SEE MORE!  I am now officially hooked.  I bought this designer first season and love it! love the cleverly designed case.  It is sooo appropriate!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|After seeing this film in 3D I thought the 2D version would be disappointing, but I was completely wrong. I took a risk and it was worth it - great movie, and 2D seems perfect for it, at least in my home-theater with 50'' plasma. Enjoy.

B001LYD2K4|5.0|I may be slightly overrating the first two Michael Schenker albums slightly but I guess I'm just blown away by the overall sound quality and musicianship that both LPs have provided. `MSG' which was released slightly over one year after the debut could really be considered the first album by the Michael Schenker Group as the first featured mostly sessioneers (outside of Michael and Gary Barden).  Cozy Powell, Paul Raymond and Chris Glen complete the lineup of seasoned rock vets for Michael's second opus and while `MSG' does not have a song that compares with \\"Armed and Ready\\" or \\"Lost Horizons\\" it still features some amazing tunes. Favorites included such moody burners as \\"Let Sleeping Dogs Lie\\", \\"On and On\\", \\"But I Want More\\" and what would be a sort of theme song for the \\"Mad Axeman\\" in that appropriately named track. I also really like \\"Secondary Motion\\" as an album closer as the solo is absolutely superb.  I prefer the first record to the second because of the two songs already mentioned, but you kinda need both as they are similar in quality though MSG seems to have an overall better sound.  Michael's career as a solo artist never took off after such a promising start and like most troubled geniuses, not being able to keep this band together may have been the biggest reason why Michael Schenker never reached superstardom in the US....look behind the window winter's gone..
B00164GDE6|4.0|I've loved this movie since it came out in 1995. I have the original DVD and the special edition version. Sorry to say that the special edition regular DVD has better quality then the BluRay. I don't get why the movie companies aren't restoring/enhancing the movies before they transfer them to the blueray disc. These things cost almost 20.00 and I want my monies worth. I spent lots of money getting a nice HD TV, bluray player, surround sound system but if the movie isn't transferred right they all my hd equipment is useless. I've seen this movie on one of my DirecTv HD channels and the picture was way better then this BluRay disc.<br /><br />Pros:<br />GREAT movie<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not digitally enhanced or restored. Normal DVD looks better!
B001DDBCUU|3.0|I was never a big fan of Sex and the City.  I always considered it silly and lightweight and rarely watched any of the episodes when it was on TV.  However, there are times in life which are appropriate for this kind of fluff and that's why I found myself in a movie theater last night, smiling to myself and giggling a bit as I watched this famous foursome go through their paces.<br /><br />The film opens with a glitzy gay wedding which is inconsequential to the plot but shows off a lot of fashion.  Later, the four women get invited to a middle-eastern vacation in Abu Dhabi and this is where the fun begins.  Away from New York they get to examine their lives and check out another culture.  Life here is opulent, fun and, full of conversations about their problems with men, motherhood and menopause.  Of course their wardrobes are fabulous and there are good looking men all around them.  And then one of the women makes the unpardonable sin of kissing a man on a beach and she is arrested. How this all plays out is humorous and ridiculous.<br /><br />However I found myself caught up in the plot, giggling at all the right places, and finding myself agreeing with the women's issues which surfaced in this flick.  Don't expect any new revelations or anything serious.  Just accept this film for what it is - a way to pass time for a couple our hours and escape into another world.<br /><br />I give this film a reluctant lukewarm recommendation.
B003C1QIO6|5.0|Jack's new release 'To The Sea' feels like a day at the beach. It has a more raw, upbeat feel than his other CDs, but I think thats a good thing. There's nothing groundbreaking here, but Jack is not a groundbreaking artist. He is true to himself, and I think the direction he went with this CD is positive. There is definitely a noticeable influence from Zach Gill on this record, but I dont think that is a bad thing. Some people will complain that he's moving away from the simpler acoustic stuff, but for me it is a welcome change. Jack has turned it up a notch from Sleep Through The Static, IMO. Top to bottom its a rock solid CD that almost any Jack Johnson fan will like.<br /><br />You And Your Heart - 8/10 - Took a few listens to grow on me, but its solid and a great opener to the CD. Great video, too.<br /><br />To The Sea - 8/10 - A home run. Funky, fun, and just plain good. Love the guitar work near the end. Very Hendrix-like. This will be new vintage Jack in a few years.<br /><br />No Good With Faces - 9/10 - I LOVE this song. One of the best on the CD, IMO. A simple song with a haunting feel. But lets not get ahead of ourselves, theres more songs to review...<br /><br />At Or With Me - 10/10 - Wow. Best song on the CD, IMO. This song was recorded in a single take in the studio as a demo, but they liked the raw feel so much they put it on the CD. Very upbeat, very catchy, and a great live jam. Unlike anything hes ever done. Love the blues harp that comes in unexpectedly towards the end. I hope he keeps this in his live setlist. Oh-Oh-Oh-Ohhhh!<br /><br />When I Look Up - 4/10 - I wish this was a longer song, and the length is the only reason I give it a low score. Could have been left off the CD and it wouldnt have made a difference. It sounds like an intro, and thats how I see it...as an intro to...<br /><br />From The Clouds - 8.5/10 - I REALLY like this song. Its a summer beach song for sure. Love how the guitar and piano compliment each other. \\"Youre so sweet to me, when you beat me in double solitaire...and youre so sweet to me, in a world thats not always fair\\". Vintage Jack.<br /><br />My Little Girl - 7/10 - A nice little love song. Simple, sincere, and to the point. Jack does mellow and tender like nobodys business. Best acoustic song on the CD.<br /><br />Turn Your Love - 7/10 - I love the music on this track, and this song is growing on me quickly.<br /><br />The Upsetter - 6/10 - My least favorite song on the CD...Just too much going on, it feels kinda clunky. I like parts of it and the lyrics, and get what he was trying to do, but it just doesnt work for me.<br /><br />Red Wine, Mistakes, Mythology -  9/10 - Another song that WOWED me. A raw, jammy feel. Reminds me of something Id hear in a New Orleans club. Just a fun song with a funky vibe and great lyrics. This is summertime porch music.<br /><br />Pictures of People Taking Pictures - 7.5/10 - This song had to grow on me. At first it annoyed me...but the more I listen, the more I like it. Ray Davies comes to mind when I hear the lyrics. And although it seems a bit repetitive at times, it somehow works. Give it a few listens and I think you'll agree.<br /><br />Anything But The Truth - 7/10 - like the other slower, acoustic songs on this CD, this one is growing on me. Its soothing to listen to and the music is beautiful.<br /><br />Only The Ocean - 8/10 - This song feels like a sunset on the beach, which is fitting for the closing song on the CD. Haunting music...good lyrics...it pulls me in every time I hear it. A great final track.<br /><br />Having the CD for a few days, I now believe this may be his best release to date. Overall, a must have for any Jack Johnson fan, and for anyone who likes fun, mellow, feel-good, non-pretentious music.

B0013FSL0C|5.0|This is one of the best shows I've ever seen, and I really don't care for dramatic television.  The writing and directing are exceptional.  The acting is simply brilliant.  Gabriel Byrne and Dianne Wiest going head-to-head is just a privledge to watch.  What I like that is different about this show is it takes you into the therapists sessions.  You're actually the \\"fly on the wall.\\"  If you like shows with deep character development and phenomenal acting, then I highly recommend this show.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Alexandria was one of the most glorious cities of Eurasia, a hybrid of three sets of cultures, European, Nubian and Asian created by Alexander and the Ptolemy dynasty around 320BCE.  Its heyday was probably around 200BCE and it lasted well over a millennium.  Alexandria was eclipsed by the dark ages around 415 when the whole of Egyptian history in the classical mould came to an end as Theodosius, the Emperor of a dying Rome imposed Christianity on Egypt.  Most temples, their gods and writings were destroyed or defaced, from Zeus in Olympia to the temple of Artemis at Ephesus in modern Turkey.  In Egypt the Seraphium was destroyed, a daughter library to the famous library of Alexandria that was probably largely destroyed around 50BCE when Julius Caesar took over Alexandria and Egypt fell under Roman sway.  This film is very much an encapsulation of the Christianisation of Alexandria and the destruction of its ancient ways, making it ripe for ruin and decay.  The one structure that did survive that forms a backdrop to this film is the Pharos lighthouse, created in 250BCE that survived all the way into around 1280 by which time Alexandria was part of the Islamic Empire.    As a satellite city of Rome, Alexandria still enjoyed a cultural and educational reputation at the time of Hypatia, a neoplatonist philosopher who had studied in Athens and Italy.  She taught at the Seraphaeum representing a sort of University/Library scholastic complex dedicated to learning.  Hypatia was part scientist and mathematician but also and no less importantly a philosopher.  She probably believed in transcendental modes of consciousness as taught by Plotinus.  She worked with her farther Theon and together they edited several works, clarified various mathematical books added their own contributions, none of which have survived (though some of Hypatias editing may be present in Greek mathematics that she helped transmit).  Hypatia invented or devised several scientific instruments.  She wasobviously a person of importance, not merely a noted academic.  Towards 415AD there was a power struggle between the Roman prefect Orestes and the Roman Archbishop Cyril of Alexandria.  Orestes was allied with Hypatia and Cyril probably engineered her elimination as a symbol of paganism and witchcraft.    What facts we have come from the letters of her students among other works, including clergymen and the historian Socrates Scholasticus.  We know very little about whether the Serapheum had a large book collection and how much of the library of Alexandria had survived there into the time of Hypatia.    This film encapsulates the facts available in the context of a triangle of rivalry between Judaism, Christianity and Paganism and also a struggle between the Church and State.  It objectifies Alexandria seen from space.  The restoration of the city is very good but perhaps does not do justice to the glories of the city that once was that probably possessed more colour, rather than the dusty restoration the film presents.  I was disappointed that there were so many candles shown.  They did not use candles.  They used lamps of olive oil and we know much about these lamps from surviving examples.  So much more could have been shown about Hypatia herself, even as a semi fictitious character.  Maybe a vignette of her writing with a quill pen in lamp light, and how she travelled around in a carriage rather than on foot.  Here we do get glimpses of her with her students and a famous incident of her rebuffing one of them who declared his love for her.  This incident did take place.  More is shown of Hypatia the astronomer and scientist and less of her as a spiritual being, a philosopher though some indication is given.  My favourite line is concerns Hypatia stating that her father would have celebrated a conjunction between Mars and perhaps Jupiter in Aquarius.  Hypatia was no atheist secularist though she would have been a rational thinker who questioned dogma as the filmtries to show.    I believe that given the limited resources the film commanded they have done the best they could.  Indeed certain details of the script reveal a depth of reading and research that is new to me to deserve exploration.  They concentrate on Hypatia formulating a heliocentric view of the Earth's rotation as stated by Aristarchus from one of his books.  We hear about this book from the \\"mother library\\" that once was in Alexandria of which the Serapheum, associated with Hypatia was a satellite.    In this film they indicate bloody conflicts arising between the pagans and the Christians.  I think that most of the aggression came from the Christians given they were supported by Rome and there isn't much evidence for the pagans attacking Christians in cold blood as indicated (though blood was probably spilt one way or another).  We are aware that the Serapheum was destroyed and the film recreates this incident on the basis of a precedent which is questionable.  Later we see another scene where the Jews rouse the ire of the Christians.  What is clear from history is that the Jews of Alexandria were attacked and dispersed, again rendered in unholy detail in this film.  The ancient anti semitism is portrayed very realistically and may arouse emotion.    The conflict between Orestes and St Cyril is dramatized extremely well leading to a rather tragic climax.  Rachel Weisz gives a good performance where Hypatia stands out like an English heroine.  The real Hypatia may have been a bit more tanned (and theoretically a lot older when she died) but Weisz is believable.  If only the props were a bit better, with lamps and a carriage for her.  Her face looks pained and haunted as she is lead to her death, dealt with rather sensitively if a touch unconvincingly given Hypatia's slave who softens the blow.    Dramatic license is acceptable and much of the context is very powerfully served up.  I could have watched a film an hour longer if necessary if more history was introduced.  We see the theatre and overall the city comes alive, about as close as a film could ever take you to classical Alexandria.  The fanaticism of emergent Christianity is I believe faithful enough though this film is not an attack on religion per se.  Indeed, it always tries to create a precedent to indicate why the Christians became hostile, precedents not always contained in history though the hostility was clear.  Overall, the film does a good job.    The greatest tragedy of this film is that despite covering its costs it has had a poor audience in the USA and the UK.  As far as I'm aware the film was only largely shown in London in two cinemas and rather tentatively at that.  I get the impression there is a conspiracy to suppress this film that mirrors the conspiracy to suppress Hypatia.  Far more deserves to be shown of Alexandria as a centre of learning and humanity at its finest.  Egypt was far more glorious then than it even aspires to today.  However the glories of Alexandria continue to emerge from the sea.  Above all the Egyptians could learn from this film, though the bulk of them will probably remain unconvinced.    The flavor and power of this film is sufficiently strong and convincing for it to be considered very significant.  At least as significant as the old Cleopatra film (with Elizabeth Taylor) that happened to be a cinematic flop.  I just hope this film helps to keep the lamps and the light alive for civilisation to continue without getting bogged down in dogma.
B000002IJL|2.0|I know this CD was released long ago but I am shocked by all the good to great reviews it gets.  I have this CD and while every song is very good I can not recommend a CD with ten tracks that clocks in at under 24 minutes.  I thought my CD player was broken when i first saw the length of the whole CD.  Somebody should re-release this soundtrack and add about 15 more songs to it.
0451196716|5.0|This was the first Stephen King that I read. I didn't really know what to expect but the premise sounded interesting so I gave it a shot. I found that I was very attached to the characters and when bad things starting happening, I was surprised how much I was affected. Very good book. Highly recommended.
B001DF68MA|4.0|Great product and extremely easy to install.  Actually, I was so excited to take my 18 month old son for a ride, we put it together as soon as it came in the mail. He absolutely loves it and did not want to get off the bike. The seat seems very safe, sturdy and secure. The fact that its more in the middle of the bike helps with balance and control... it really wasn't any different than riding by myself.  A+
B001OQCV6K|4.0|Good movie.  I really enjoyed it.  Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law were great.
B00275EGWY|1.0|The Hurt Locker is based on special military units that defuse bombs at their peril. Unfortunately, director Kathryn Bigelow plods slowly in this film. Little action but it is full of emotional destruction. A depressing film to say the least with a long run time. It is no Platoon or Full Metal Jacket. I support the military but the actors just didn't develop for me to care about them. The film is heavy, long periods of filler, and should have been more cohesive. Unlike Platoon, it was if they didn't have any fear about defusing bombs.     The military scenes where they go into a building showed soldiers not checking for snipers or others while standing near open windows. Remember the Aliens Sgt. saying, \\"Check those corners. Check those corners!\\" Of course, these guys just walk into a bomb shop. Trip wires? Oh, not in this film. Trip wires are attached to bombs that blow up soldiers going through an enemy's camp or territory. In Predator, they checked for trip wires. Guess Iraq had none. Or, the writer forgot about it like forgetting about snipers.    Why this movie won Best Picture was beyond me. Even though I thought Avatar was a little kiddie film, at least its shortcomings were covered by developed characters and action. The movie is just too slow and way too long. Sorry, but the acting was also second rate. They also could have found some actors that looked like they were military types too. Jeremy Renner is a utility actor not a lead.

B003ELOQCU|3.0|Why is the opening track (in this case, \\"Breathe\\") a 'bonus' track?  That's not cool.  Could you imagine the Sydney DVD with \\"Zoo Station\\" as a bonus track?

B001TJBAU0|4.0|I read this book because I understand that Keynes is very influential in modern economic policy.  I wanted to understand the theories behind the policy.    This is written from the perspective of a beginning student of economics without the benefit of classes.  I'm just basically reading about economics because I want to know...      Keynes says at the outset that this is written to the professional economist he hopes it will be within the reach of the average person, but that is not his audience.  He was right.  This is NOT a casual read.  It is a very VERY heavy read.  I read \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" and Ricardo's \\"Principles of Political Economy.\\"  I had hoped that this would be some preparation, and it was to a certain degree.  However, I still read this with a notebook and pen-taking several pages of notes.  I had to do some background research on some of the things he talks about, but I got through it.    The book was dry.  Very dry.  It was written on a very theoretical level.  Smith and Ricardo both took made up scenarios and explained how their theories applied and worked in this scenario.  No such example in this book.  He added a lot of un-needed words and phrases.  It made the book a little harder to follow.      All that being said, he kept moving.  Smith and Ricardo tended to beat certain points to death.  No such thing here.      Overall, it was an enjoyable read.  I was fascinated by it.     I do not feel qualified to comment on the nuts and bolts of his theories.  However, his conclusion-was like...insane...  That's all I'll say.  I can't stand these morons that write a book review and pontificate about their opinions.
B00005MP58|5.0|Pride & Prejudice is a wonderful story about romance and love and the misunderstandings that can occur. Thru it all, love conquers all. There are many versions of this movie. It may not be the newest, but it is the best! I love this movie. Even my children (ages 6, 7, & 9) love this movie!! It stays true to the book. And, who doesn't love Colin Firth?
B003A3K3JW|5.0|This is the kind of CD that makes you rub your ears. These are kids from the lowest slums of Caracas, some of them as young as twelve. They have no right to sound this accomplished, and it's a wonder that professional musicians don't hide their heads in shame. I'm only half joking. However much is owed to the microphones, the Simon Bolivar Youth Orch. delivers a Rite of Spring that stands comparison with the best. Dudamel's reading is as energized and violently exultant as my old standard, Leonard Bernstein with the NY Phil. Except for the eerie opening solo from the bassoon and the hushed interlude before the maiden dances herself to death, every bar is hair-raising.<br /><br />Up to now, I have been guilty of asking \\"what have you done for me lately?\\" in regards to Dudamel. We are past the wunderkind stage -- well, not quite -- and as the dust settles from the hype tornado, one wonders if brash exuberance will mature into something finer. Now that I've heard twenty or so concerts from him online, I know that Dudamel has both a charismatic and a callow side. Here, the two meld. This isn't a reflective or thoughtful Le sacre. It's Le sacre as performed by the Broadway cast of \\"Stomp!\\" Not that thoughtful is a completley desirable way to approach Stravinsky's barbaric masterpiece. Better to say that Dudamel has found his own style, departing from Boulez'a analystical disseciton, the composer's razor-sharp frigidity, and Maazel's virtuosity for its own sake. Dudamel feels the score viscerally, and you feel him.<br /><br />Dudamel has made a crusade out of promoting the music of Mexico and South America. Here we get a different reworking of primitivism from Silvestre Revueltas, the visionary Mexican modernist who died just short of his forty-first birthday in 1940. Revueltas had heard Le sacre with open ears and offered a Latin descendant in his well known Sensamaya (Bernstein was a fan and made an early, riveting recording of it).  Dudamel performs a suite taken from the 1939 film \\"La noche de los mayas,\\" directed by Chano Urueta, a contemporary of the composer's who made films up to 1974. the style is crushingly primordial, and spookily reminiscent at times of Messiaen once the birds have flown south. Dudamel gives what sounds like a definitive performance -- or at the very least the best I'm likely to hear -- and since the youthful percussionists of the SBYO are incendiary, the listener won't miss the percussion cadenza added to the suite after the composer's death.<br /><br />In all, this is a recording to make me believe, even more than I did, in Dudamel's potential and to celebrate the growth of an impoverished youth orchestra into a force for joy and light.<br /><br />As an addendum, here are the notes for La noche de los mayas offered by the Kennedy Center online:<br /><br />The suite assembled by Limantour stands as the largest in scale of all Revueltas's concert works, and the closest of them to a symphony. Its four-part structure also offers a sort of parallel to the similarly proportioned one Virgil Thomson produced from his own score for Pare Lorentz's 1937 documentary The River--a parallel in the sense that neither of these suites is a mere pastiche of fetching fragments, each being nothing less than a full-scale descriptive symphony, faithful both to symphonic structure and to the dramatic sense of the music's original function. The four movements of Revueltas's \\"posthumous symphony\\" may be summarized as follows:<br /><br />I. NOCHE DE LOS MAYAS (Molto sostenuto) is an atmospheric piece, mysterious, brooding, suggesting perhaps mighty powers now dormant, images of volcanoes and pyramids. The middle section is brighter and lyrical, but the movement ends as it began.<br /><br />II. NOCHE DE JARANAS (Scherzo, \\"Night of Revelry\\"). Jarana is not only a Spanish term for \\"revelry,\\" but in Mexico the name of a particular dance form in which Spanish and native influences are blended. Experts in such matters suggest likenesses to the huapango, the jarabe and the son. This scherzo fairly bursts with activity and stunning colors, and is filled with surprising and frequently humorous turns. It is quite a workout for the orchestra, and for the large percussion section in particular.<br /><br />III. NOCHE DE YUCAT&aacute;N (Andante espressivo). The \\"slow movement\\" alludes to the Yucat&aacute;n peninsula as home to the Mayans in their magnificent second period. This nocturne is not so much mystical as straightforwardly voluptuous and impassioned. The strings carry the main burden, with imaginative support from clarinets, horns and tuba. Less voluptuous but more touchingly intimate is an interlude in which a solo flute, accompanied by an Indian drum and rattle, introduces the gently melancholy tune of a Mayan song still sung in parts of Yucat&aacute;n, the Xtoles, a paean to the day's end and twilight. When the strings resume the opening material they are muted, and this passage leads without pause to the final and most elaborate movement.<br /><br />IV. NOCHE DE ENCANTAMIENTO (Theme and Variations, \\"Night of Enchantment\\") begins in an atomosphere of heightened tension and anticipation. After about a minute and a half comes the aforementioned cadenza devised by Enrique Diemecke, based on various works of Revueltas: material for guïro (a notched gourd, of Cuban origin) and native tambourine, recognizable as having come from the second movement of this suite; a drum figure from the Homenaje a Garc&iacute;a Lorca; a xylophone motif from Sensemay&aacute;. Once the variations get under way, the music becomes increasingly charged and frenzied. The listener is not likely to notice the transition from one variation to the next, but rather to be swept up in the almost frightening momentum and abandon of the music, as the brasses give out primordial chants and the percussion become more and more assertive, not merely punctuating the rhythm but driving the whole unstoppable and ever expanding force of the wild celebration--a grand sacrificial dance, perhaps, which, like the one at the end of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, does not so much come to an end as simply exhaust itself.rzo fairly bursts with activity and stunning colors, and is filled with surprising and frequently humorous turns.

B002BWQ6H6|3.0|A few weeks back, I decided I was in the mood for a great book, so I chose this one (what with the awards and all). I was disappointed. First, the writing is great--lines like \\"Revolving doors pushed quarters of conversation out into the street\\" stuck with me. The problem is that, for me, the story just didn't do it. For a while it seemed to be building toward something, but it never really gets there and at some point whatever momentum there is just sort of peters out and I slogged my way through to the end. As others have pointed out, there's a lot of intersection between the characters, but it seems to be used more in an attempt to make the plot more interesting or generate momentum--look, Character A just showed up in Character B's story! Character C is actually Character B's mom!--but since none of the stories are that interesting in the end, it didn't really work for me. It might work as a study of NY in the 70s (I couldn't say), but I was expecting more out of the National Book Award winner ....
B001HN69AY|3.0|I thought this would be a great movie. I really did based on the trailers advancing this movie. It looked smart, it looked funny, and it looked well done. This revelation was only to be true in the trailer because when I actually started to watch the movie nothing like this was born out. The good material from the trailer was the only the only two- minutes of anything worth watching. Well, anyway it was just slow and seemed poorly thought out as it was very, very hurky jerky. Just avoid it and do something better with your time.
B002U33GUQ|4.0|\\"Highway Rider\\" has Brad Mehldau, some Larry Grenadier on bass, Jeff Ballard and/or Matt Chamberlin on drums, some Joshua Redman on sax, and 7 songs with an orchestra.  The orchestral parts remind me of a movie soundtrack, but of course Mehldau's playing brings it back to jazz.  Some of the songs without the orchestra go in a modern piano trio direction, and have a rhythmic or percussive sound similar to stuff The Bad Plus, Vijay Iyer, or even Matthew Shipp have done.  The last category of song on \\"Highway Rider\\" is the more melodic song which is what Mehldau is known for.  A lot of those songs have Redman playing beautiful saxophone.  He stays within the songs and calls attention to the melody.  A 2-disc set, there is certainly enough good material to merit its 104 minute length.  It's recommended to fans of Brad Mehldau.
1400067936|4.0|Taleb points out some of the systematic errors in human expectations of future events and the general nature of random processes. His writing style is not my favorite, he chooses it put in a great deal of his own personality which at times makes it somewhat unclear. He has a few points to get across but uses 250 pages to do so; a bullet point version could sum it up in a few pages. But the stories included make it more memorable and it is a fairly enjoyable read, so I would still recommend it.
1423113381|5.0|The alternating narrative of the Kane siblings is fresh and easy to keep up with. The story is fast paced with lots of action and, true to RR form, a few twists and turns.      I imagine the success of the PJ series had much to do with the fact that RR wove an interesting story around a mythology that *most* people, myself included, were familiar with. Because of this, I think that TRP spent more time educating the reader than on the laughs we came to love in the PJ series. That said, I found TRP was not only a good book but also a great introduction for this Egyptian mythology newbie and fully expect RR to amp up the comedy in the 2nd installment.
B000091OB6|5.0|If you love this album and you have a turntable, then this is a must buy! First, it's pressed on 180-gram vinyl, which means the vinly is thicker. Thicker vinyl will produce a better sound than regular vinyl. Second, it's a limited edition. Third, you get to see the album cover as it's meant to be seen. Pics of the smaller faces in the crowd are seen, and reading the liner notes is a joy!   I bought 2 copies, one to play and one for collecting (or until the vinyl wears out on the first one).
B00275EGWY|1.0|If you looking for an accurate depiction of how the fine men and women of the US Army dismantle IEDs, don't count on this movie to provide it for you.  If you really want to learn about the risks involved with this profession, watch the 60 Minutes piece on it that really describes how life is for soldiers in this profession.  The fact that this movie won an Academy Award only goes to show that awards in Tinseltown are handed out based on political affiliations, not on merit.
006123205X|3.0|wanted to listen to the CD on a six week vacation.  There were 10 days from the time I was told the CD was mailed till I left on vacation.  The CD did not arrive in those 10 days.
B002SJIO4A|4.0|Good movie. Just amazing effects. Watch the office worker turn his whole alien hater attitude around. See him get screwed by \\"Dear old Dad\\". I sure hope they can make a sequel that shows when Chris gets back. It would be interesting.
B003BZXI6E|5.0|There is only one word and it represents talent, fame, gorgeous voice, wonderful actress and the ultimate performer. Yes, many can say they have a fan base or sell out concerts but one performer commands your respect and that is Barbra. Excellent Blu Ray but lets be clear if Barbra was to recite the alphabet, I'd buy it. For her fans this video is a dream, makes you think your right there with her. Seeing Barbra's Concerts in person I can only say I felt I was in the room with her with this video. Every Streisand fan should own this video, excellent 10 stars!
0060977493|5.0|This book won the Booker Prize for Literature.  And \\"in my book,\\" it's also a world-class (as well as world-lit) winner, heartbreaking, haunting, and wise.<br /><br />The main action takes place in India in 1969, but it jumps around in time.  As the author put it, the story \\"begins at the end and ends in the middle.\\"  So we know from the beginning that there has been a terrible tragedy that permanently affected the lives of fraternal twins Estha (boy) and Rahel (girl.)  The book is about finding out exactly what it was that happened; and how and why it happened.<br /><br />I guessed most of the answer pretty early on, but I think that was the intent of the author.  The book is more about the process than the solution, and she gives the reader plenty of hints, respecting the reader's intelligence and gently guiding him or her to figure out the answer for himself or herself.  It's not so much a novel of mystery or suspense as it is one of psychology (of both personality and relationships) and social commentary.  Ms. Roy shows enormous insight into her characters and their situation, and while the writing is deceptively lovely and easy to read, The God of Small Things has a great deal of depth.<br /><br />Some of her insight comes from writing about what she knows.  Parts of the story are autobiographical.  Arundhati Roy grew up in the same rural town in India where the book is set, and her grandmother really did own and run a pickle factory.  A recipe for Banana Jam is included which not only sounds delicious, but also easily doable for the average American cook. (I'm totally fascinated by how the banana puree turns scarlet red as it cooks.  I've got to try that!)<br /><br />Since the reader has already mostly figured out what happened, in a way the big \\"reveal\\" scene in which the full tragedy is described in detail, is anti-climactic; and again I feel certain that this is deliberate.  It is as if Ms. Roy wants us to focus on the characters - why they each behaved asthey did, and how they were affected, rather than the actual events.  There are still a couple of surprises coming, though.  Yet even with those, one feels less surprise than might be expected.  There's a sense of, \\"Of course - I should have seen that coming.\\"  Because although the author hasn't given us any hints about those particular surprises, she has set up a certain subtle and carefully-crafted atmosphere in which such surprising/shocking/awful things become the natural or logical cause (in one case) or consequence (in the other case.)  And this ability of hers to hit us with a big surprise while making it seem not all that surprising, is part of Ms. Roy's genius.<br /><br />The ending is also anti-climactic, and yet again this is clearly the author's intent.  Partly this is because the book ends, as she says, in the middle.  I think that, after all the tragedy and loss of the the story, she wanted us to leave the book on a note of gentleness, love, and hope.<br /><br />Social commentary is a strong theme throughout this work.  (Arundhati Roy became a social activist after it was published to such acclaim that she was able to wield considerable influence.)  As an adjunct to that, the breaking of taboos and the consequences of that are two major story lines.  In one, the consequences are terrible.  Yet later, an even more pervasive (across many cultures) and powerful taboo is broken without any noticeable consequence.  In fact, Roy has prepared the reader so well that the taboo act comes across as natural, appropriate, and even a positive thing for the characters involved.  It is a brilliant and thought-provoking juxtaposition.<br /><br />I was totally charmed by the way this author plays with the English language.  She thinks out of the box:  breaks the rules in such a way that it makes sense, rather than causing chaos and confusion.  She capitalizes certain words against the rules of grammar, as a very successful way of emphasizing them (\\". . . life was fullof Beginnings and no Ends, and Everything was Forever . . . \\").  She makes up words, often by combining one or more words (\\"a viable die-able age\\"  \\"sicksweet\\", \\"a Furrywhirring and a Sariflapping\\", \\"dullthudding\\") or by deliberate misspellings (\\"Infinnate\\").  The result is a sense of non-native-English-speakers' minds, a foreign perspective and way of thinking; or perhaps the perspective of a child.  Either way, that is so fitting for the setting of the book.<br /><br />And it's much the same as the way she breaks the rules of structure (i.e., rules of chronology, de-emphasizing the climax, letting us guess the answer to the mystery early on, etc.)  in ways that work, that beautifully and creatively accomplish what she is trying to do with the book.  She's an ultimate example of how someone with a thorough knowledge of the rules can know when and how to break them.<br /><br />The God of Small Things is an outstanding work of fiction, one that I think fully deserves its award and acclaim.  So far it is Ms. Roy's only novel, as she has been occupied in the decade since its publication with social activism.  However, the Kindle edition that I read included an interview with the author in which she says that she is now writing a new book.  I hope that it is finished and published soon.  I would love to read more of her work.<br /><br />Quotes from The God of Small Things:<br /><br />\\"Occasionally, when Ammu listened to songs that she loved on the radio, something stirred inside her.  A liquid ache spread under her skin, and she walked out of the world like a witch, to a better, happier place.  On days like this there was something restless and untamed about her.  As though she had temporarily set aside the morality of motherhood and divorc&eacute;e-hood.  Even her walk changed from a safe mother-walk to another wilder sort of walk. She wore flowers in her hair and carried magic secrets in her eyes.  She spoke to no one. She spent hours on the riverbank with her littleplastic transistor shaped like a tangerine.  She smoked cigarettes and had midnight swims.<br />  What was it that gave Ammu this Unsafe Edge?  This air of unpredictability?  It was what she had battling inside her.  An unmixable mix.  The infinite tenderness of motherhood and the reckless rage of the suice bomber.\\"<br /><br />\\"He trembled his own body like a man with malaria.\\"<br /><br />\\"It is after all so easy to shatter a story.  To break a chain of thought.  To ruin a fragment of a dream being carried around carefully like a piece of porcelain.<br />  To let it be, to travel with it, as Velutha did, is much the harder thing to do.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's true.  Things can change in a day.\\"<br /><br />(321 pages)
B0037AGASG|5.0|My daughter is a huge fan and I get to listen to him in the car and around the house. :) He is really good - 'our' favorite right now is Stuck in the Moment.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved this book.  But it VERY MUCH needs to be read after \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire.\\"  It is a continuation of it and won't make sense on its own.  It is a wrap up of the wonderful stories begun in \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire.\\"  The second is by far the most important.  I only wish I had read this before I had gone to Sweden.  I actually feel like I'm there with Larsson's descriptions.  How I can be persuaded to really care about a savant early 20's girl in Sweden, I have no idea, but care I do.  Larsson is a master story teller.  His two main characters are people I wouldn't like much at all in real life, but I really care about both of them.  The book never seems to talk down to the reader though it gets very complicated.  Sort of like real life.
B002T921AC|5.0|First off, the reviews for his music are kind of sad coming from adults. Did you really buy the product or are you just bashing a kid? Anyway back on topic. Justin is really talented, my daughter is a huge fan and listens to him all the time. This was actually a birthday gift for her - the newer CD I bought her earlier this year. The music is catchy and memorable. And a big bonus is he does not whine at the end of each sentance, like the Jonus Brothers or Hannah Montana, believe me that gets old fast. Out of all of the music she has listened to in the last year or so - this is one CD I encourage my daughter to listen to, because I like it too.
B00336G7HI|4.0|I purchased this battery for my Sony DSC-SX63 flash camcorder, as a 2nd battery for longer filming.  The thing that I like about Sony batteries is that they show an approximate time of battery left.  The time showing left is not exact, unless you do not zoom or use other features while filming.  This one lasts about \\"an hour\\" longer than the battery that it came with.<br /><br />I just used it yesterday to film at a zoo.  We were at the zoo for about 4 hours.  I took about 1 hour of video, and there was about \\"30 minutes\\" left on the battery from a full recharge.  The zooming, which is mechanical, is what really wears on this battery. If I had used the LCD light, it may have drained a little faster as well.<br /><br />Overall, it really helps to have a 2nd battery, especially one that lasts longer than the default one.  So I recommend getting this battery for your \\"V\\" type Sony device.

To The Sea is Johnson attempt to go back to the sound everyone fell in love with on the records In Between Dreams and On and On.

030745455X|2.0|This is not really a full review as much as a critique of an aspect of this book which drove me crazy.  Why is it that in airplane novels everyone has to be not just good at something, but superhuman in every way.  I read the first book of the trilogy and thought it was implausible, but ok.  I didn't buy that a 20 year old middle school dropout with aspbergers could actually be a world renowned hacker, but whatever.  In the follow-up, she is not just the world's best hacker (there is no system she cannot break!), she is also a world-class boxer (at 90 pounds, no less), a master of disguise rivaling James Bond, a chess grandmaster, an unparalelled math genius (she solves Fermat's Last Theorum in her head...seriously), and a billionaire white collar criminal.  She's kind of like a genetically-modified Rain Man on steroids.<br /><br />This just drives me bonkers.  I would really like to see what would happen if you put Lisbeth Salander up against Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan - after all, he was a Navy SEAL, saved the world at least twice, and eventually became president (he filled the role with honor and humility).  It would be like one of those irresolvable debates that 10 year olds have about whether Superman could beat up Batman.<br /><br />In all seriousness, this convention made this novel really more of a comic book than a read for serious adults.  The ultimate effect on me was that I found the book to be juvenille and felt silly reading it.

I'm not a teacher; instead, I am a long-time student and new yoga studio owner.  This book truly has something for ALL of us.  It tells the whole story -- the big picture -- of yoga in a modern, accessible way. The book is practical, well-organized and user-friendly. Love Appendix D - the elements of asana - clever and helpful!
B003405MF6|5.0|I recently purchased the new Jeff Beck CD-Emotion & Commotion. If you like Jeff Beck`s guitar sound, get ready to experience it all over again. Jeff`s playing will touch you like never before. He has taken the road less traveled when it comes to trying out new sounds. You will not be disappointed. He will take you on a magical voyage to guitar land. And you won`t want to come back again. He expresses himself like no other guitarist in this world. Each song goes beyond the hemisphere with his expressive type of playing. Totally worth your time and patience. Give a listen and hold on tight. He is a master of illusion & sound. Get it and you won`t regret it. Thanks for letting me give my opinion.-- Oscar

B002ZCDR88|5.0|As Natalie writes in the booklet, I was never much of a poetry reader either, but with the lyrics and the incredible music she wrote for this double album, it makes this the best and most interesting album she has ever released.  It is simple magnificent with the highest sound quality I have heard on any CD.  And if it doesn't win a Grammy I will be very surprised.     Way to go Natalie.   Don't forget that most of the very best music written today is poetry also, and these poems play as if they were written for today, not some time in the past.  They will surprise you!
0307387178|1.0|One of the many reasons I disliked this book was because of the biased way Krakauer wrote about Chris McCandless. Throughout a lot of the book, he would say something along the lines of \\"This could have befallen Chris\\" or \\"-so-and-so- made all these silly mistakes\\" and then follow it up with \\"But of course, Chris was far too driven/smart/courageous/perfect for this to happen to him.\\" He glorified a boy who shouldn't have been glorified. The parallels he drew were poor, and he always seemed to be making excuses for Chris' ignorance or stupidity.    He also completely ignored any of the bad aspects of Chris' \\"odyssey\\" - the people he hurt, the laws he broke, and the contradictions between what he complained about and what he did. I'm sure he - and Krakauer himself - was supposed to come across as a boy with all the right ideas who was smart enough to do what he wanted, but what I got from it was an ignorant, arrogant boy who thought he could tame the Alaskan \\"wilderness\\" - though he scorned \\"the burgeois trappings of mainstream America\\" - without any regard to anyone or anything besides himself.    Terrible story, and a terrible book.
1401923119|5.0|Having just finished a Biology class, learning the \\"central dogma\\" of DNA->mRNA->Protein, I found this book to be an awesome read.  It explains the central theorems of biology in very easily understood terms, and then enlightens the reader with the findings of the most recent research which brings quantum physics into the world of Biology.  This provides us with a new paradigm upon which we can look at the world, our society, and our roles as individuals. Everyone should read this book! Our Biology textbooks need updating!!

0316066524|5.0|\\"Live Free or Die\\" is perhaps one of the most moronic ethical pronouncements in the American lexicon. Freedom from, of course, that's always what is meant by your average Libertarian or Tea Partier: tyranny (of any description, which is why they can't tell between Obama and Hitler, just as the left often couldn't distinguish the latter from Bush), control (despite the ability to assess one's own level of self-control), coercion (but is it coercion when people willingly sit still and watch TV for six hours daily, or a simply a lousy exercise of a lazy will? Which we at Postmanisms [just Google us] are not above.).<br /><br />Freedom to, then? This seeming to mean not a jot more than \\"doing anything I want as long as it doesn't harm others,\\" leaving the assessment of harming others to each individual, be he a banker who's richly rewarded for selling toxic securities or a drive-by shooter taking revenge for his missing bling-bracelet.<br /><br />Assessing harm: Do we simply continue to buy Foxconn-made Wiis and iPads while their alienated, overworked, $300-a-month earning workers routinely suicide off the roofs of their sterile corporate dorms, and call it the price of entertainment? Do we simply watch the Gulf go dead and call it the price of driving?<br /><br />And let's be clear about government, the \\"necessary evil\\" that Publicans always focus on the last word of and Dems usually overdo the former: No amount of faddish personal virtue can prevent a life-sustaining ecosystem from collapsing under the strain of blind, careless, or greedy overuse, endless maximal exploitation. This is not an ideological point: It's all of us.
B003C1QIO6|5.0|I love this album already. I am buying it today, putting it on the stereo outside and then going to play and relax in the Missouri sun. Don't hate on Jack for playing music he likes, after all that is the best way to go. It is always an injustice when musicians cater to the old fan base over and over until we/they get burnt out. Keep it up Jack, I love your responsible outlook for the environment and respect the way you stay real and down to earth.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This movie completely draws you in. As many reviews have said the whole tone of the movie is exceptional. The subtleties and attention to detail make this rendition exquisite.  Casting is so well done that the characters come to life.  Other reviews have said it better, but I wanted to add my voice.  A film worthy of Jane Austen's romantic story. I watch it over and over.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|After picking up the Twilight series from my local library back in 2007, I became instantly hooked on the idea of vampires. I began reading everything I could find on the subject, from adult and teen fiction to historical accounts of vampire myths in the real world. However, I found myself feeling a little bit disatisfied. All of the books that I was reading were pretty much the same. A beautiful girl falls in love with a beautiful vampire...blah blah blah. I was looking for something with a darker side . When HBO's True Blood came on the air in the fall of 2008, I was very excited \\"Yay! A vampire show about REAL, bloodsucking vampires!\\" Though I still watch the show to this day, I have to admit that I am slightly off put by its graphic sexual nature. The plot of the show is simply genius, but so many scenes of violence and sex are really not necessary to the development of the story. I discovered that I needed a healthy, balanced vampire story--something dark and delicious but not gratuitously graphic and violent.     When I first heard that the CW was going to air a show about vampires, I was instantly skeptical. \\"Great. One Tree Hill, but with vampires,\\" I thought to myself. Fortunately, I gave the Vampire Diaries a chance, and now I find it impossible to stay away. Though the first few episodes played out like your general tacky teen soap opera, by the Halloween episode at the end of October, I couldn't wait to see what happened next. I was very delighted to find that the characters of the show are so well developed--not your typical teen drama bores. Each and every character, no matter how small their role, has some sort of a backstory and contributes to the development of the plot. The main character Elena Gilbert is a true heroine, not your generic Mary Sue of vampire fiction (sorry Bella). Instead of waiting around to be saved by some gorgeous man, Elena is often the one to do the saving. She has some guilt in her past, but instead of moping around about it,she makes the decision to move forward. Stefan Salvatore is Elena's boyfriend, a vampire with a heart of gold who sometimes finds himself incapable of resisting his nature. Damon Salvatore is Stefan's delectably devious older brother, a vampire who has no problem raising the body count of the town if it means getting what he wants. His non-beating heart begins to soften at the end of the season, and after Elena bonds with him over his troubled existance, he slowly begins to stake his claim on her. This leaves young Elena miserably torn between two vampire brothers whom she loves very much. In addition to the main cast, the supporting characters are equally interesting. Elena's best friend Bonnie just happens to be a witch. Her brother Jeremy struggles with drug abuse, the loss of a very dear friend, and considers immortality as the only way out of his misery. Caroline Forbes is the wonderfully shallow queen bee, Matt is  Elena's ever-loyal sidekick of sorts, and Alaric Saltzman is the history teacher with a major beef against vampires. Every character is well-rounded and wholly believable, and the superb acting makes this series a joy to watch.    As most people know, the Vampire Diaries was first a series of novels by LJ Smith in the early 90s, with new stories having been released since the beginning of the CW show. While I definitely recommend the Vampire Diaries TV show to fans of the book series, just keep in mind that they are VASTLY different from one another. It is almost as if someone wrote a piece of fanfiction for LJ Smith's novels and turned it into a full-length TV show. In the novels Elena does not have a brother, Fells Church is the name of the city (not Mystic Falls), Bonnie is a ditzy redhead who still possesses powers but is not the descendent of Salem Witches, Elena has a second best friend named Meredith with whom she is actually closer than Bonnie, and Stefan and Damon were turned into vampires during the Italian Renaissance in the 1500s--not during the Civil War in 1864 (this is an extremely important factor to the story). In fact, with the exception of the characters' names and a few major plot points, the book and screen versions are nothing alike. But if you can overlook these details, you will find yourself widely entertained by a phenomenal show.    The first season of the Vampire Diaries is for anyone who likes their vamps to be bad, but not outright offensive and sexually perverse. You will laugh at some moments and feel compelled to cry at others, while also being on your guard for the next big scare. But most of all, you will be captivated and utterly addicted to the story of a girl and her love for two vampires.
B001TW69J4|5.0|OK, really now... all five star reviews? How can this be? Family members? Non-critical thinkers? Easily swayed by published opinions? Nope... Believe the hype. This is music of virtuosic talent, both technical and artistic. A couple of times I found myself with goosebumps and talking outloud. I am beyond impressed. The depth of musical reference on display here is mind boggling. It has been well described previously, so I wont go into that. I will say however, that descriptions alone are impossibly inadequate. This is the rarest of pairings- gifted, creative music compositionally that is not limited in any way by technical skill level boundaries.<br />There are gasp inducing moments throughout, but that is not particularly unusual. Lots of people can do cool stuff that is difficult to play. After you've heard it a few times, the circus trick type stuff loses novelty and goes into the pile of somewhat disappointing but acceptably good CDs. This is not one of those CDs.<br /><br />This effort is full of surprises. One big one is the song \\"The Price of Everything and the Value of Nothing\\", which is titled ironically, as it is easily worth the price of the entire CD alone. The title does make sense in a somewhat descriptive way though. The seemingly contradictory statement that is the wording in the title is also the auditory marvel as well. It has an odd-meter almost floating time type of phrase that is repeated throughout. It is very relaxed, melodic, and open; breezy and calm with a classic jazz tone used to excellent effect. There are continuously more intense layers added underneath the repeated figure, which remains essentially unchanged. It still remains confidently relaxed and insistently steadfast, all the while, a storm rages around it that should surely wrest it from it's moorings. The tonal, meter, stylistic, and intensity contrast during this masterpiece is emotionally confusing and literally hair-raising. It is an intellectual delight beyond description. A work of remarkable musical depth. Nearly unbelievable.<br /><br />This is but one excerpt. Buy this. It is at least as good as the reviews.<br /><br />July of 2011- still impressed. Awesome CD.markable musical depth. Nearly unbelievable.    This is but one excerpt. Buy this. It is at least as good as the reviews.              July of 2011- still impressed. Awesome CD.
B001EN71DQ|1.0|I realize that I am only adding to the countless voices decrying the prequel trilogy. But I wish to address the people who claim that the original (real) trilogy is of similar quality when you stop viewing it through the eyes of a child. I also want to counter the notion that these are just petty gripes from fanboys who would never be satisfied.  Let me answer the first charge: I saw The Phantom Menace when I was 12 years old, and I loved it. I ranked it up there with the rest of the films, being dazzled by the special effects and rewarded by the presence of a few old, familiar faces. But as I got older and read more about classic films and was exposed to GOOD storytelling, I started to realize, \\"Wait a minute. None of this makes any sense. The whole plot hinges on trade agreements, negotiations, and voting in the senate? Why do the lizard people in the robes want to invade the planet with the silly name anyway? Why do they keep saying its people are dying without showing any of their suffering? It's just a bunch of flashy images; none of this has any consequence or drama or sense of fun! And won't somebody please shoot Jar Jar?!?!?\\" Going back to the original films, I experienced the rewarding satisfaction of an exciting, fun-loving adventure with characters who actually cared about what was happening and were changed by their desperate times, instead of just slogging dully through banal dialogue.  Secondly: I could certainly deal with settings, structures, and characters that were different from Luke, Han, Leia, Vader, the Death Star, etc... if they were in any way interesting. Attack of the Clones, for my money, is even worse, combining a dull, convoluted mystery (that is basically solved in the first ten minutes of the film) with the most jaw-dropping, atrocious, awkward, empty love story ever committed to celluloid. It all ends with the clones fighting the droids, and we have no one to root for, not even the Jedi, who have proven to be remarkably inept for allthe powers they were given. Episode III is marginally better, but the nothingness that went before means that this supposedly grand finale has no weight. And still the same mistakes remain! Characters say things that we are meant to blindly accept, even though we have not witnessed the events or actions they speak of. George Lucas fills a blue screen with some magnificent digital vista and then has actors walking around discussing the plot in monotone. Because of the over-emphasis on special effects, even the battle scenes are a chore to sit through because THE AUDIENCE DOESN'T CARE. Why are the Separatists fighting the Republic? Who is this Master Sifo-Dyas and why did he order an army of clones? Why are all of Yoda's lessons from The Empire Strikes Back being contradicted by the Jedi's idiocy? Could Hayden Christensen act any more poorly? I fling my arms in the air and give up.  Stick with the original films, and get some entertainment out of your DVD collection. These new films aren't just a pale imitation of their predecessors; they violate even the most basic laws of good storytelling.

It is the perfect size for his matchbox cars to drive up and down the ramps, in and out of the \\"car wash\\" and elevator.  The elevator did break - it used to have this nice gear crank mechanism which would raise and lower the elevator.  While it does not make that click, click, click noise any more and occasionally does fall down after Max has raised it - he can still get it to raise and lower cars.  If your child is a car junky like my son, they will love playing with this parking garage.

B00318EDD8|5.0|I just got this in the mail am listening to it now. Absolutely amazing sound. I had the first Disintegration CD from long ago & the difference is very noticeable on this remaster.<br /><br />I've never heard the Entreat tracks before, so this is a real \\"treat\\" for me. I read some comments that people were disappointed that it wasn't the whole Wembley show...well, the album is just Disintegration, so obviously they are only going to use the tracks from Disintegration, yes? Also, the liner notes say the Entreat tracks were are all remixed in 07/2009, so that may be an added bonus.<br /><br />Many live CDs don't sound very good, but this is certainly an exception. Smith's vocals are very clear & the overall sound is very warm and open; bass is nice & tight. Love it! Now I need to listen to the third disc of rarities...
B003C1QIO6|1.0|I agree with Phil. I have EVERYTHING Jack johnsons ever made. This is by far the worst. Wheres the laid back soul soothing tunes Jack? The band, drums, etc is just not you. Before all you defenders jump on the Jack band wagon and say \\"hes an artist expanding his talents\\" or something along those lines, I say I listen to Jack because jack at his best has no peers. this album is far from being peerless. This album seemed, rushed, boring, and way too poppy for Jack. This is a dissappointment for sure, good thing I got it on sale because the CD might just become a drink coaster. Guess I'll have to keep sitting, waiting, and wishing that Jack gets back to his roots and puts out a JACK JOHNSON style CD soon.
B002OVEB5S|3.0|Is it as good as Reign in Blood, South of Heaven or Seasons in the Abyss?<br />What? Are you on crack? No way. The last time Slayer recorded something resembling a classic album was in 1994, and it was called Divine Intervention.<br /><br />So where would you place World Painted Blood in Slayer's discography?<br />I'd say among mediocre albums like Christ Illusion or God Hate Us All. It's neither a complete disaster like Undisputed Attitude or Diabolus in Musica, nor a good album with some flaws like Show No Mercy, Hell Awaits or Divine Intervention.<br /><br />So, should I buy it or not?<br />Really, what's the point in asking this? If you're a mindless Slayer zealot like me, you already bought it. If you're just a casual Slayer fan, stick to Reign in Blood, South of Heaven, Seasons in the Abyss and maybe Divine Intervention. If you don't like Slayer, why are you reading this?<br /><br />Is the special edition worth the extra cash?<br />No way. The only thing you get is a DVD with a really amateurish film<br />about some serial killer set up to the songs in the albums which uses edited still frames, kind of a retarded version of La Jet&eacute;e filmed by some paint huffing meathead.
1402756399|2.0|The concept for this book is obviously to provide a lavishly illustrated version of what must be admitted is a dry, academic 19th century text.  Unfortunately the illustrations do little to help explain or augment the text; rather, they are often distracting.  The illustrations are mostly related to Darwin's personal life and his voyage on the Beagle...a whole separate book.  Often the text has no relationship to the accompanying illustrations.  The result is both a failure as a coffee table book and as a scholarly book.
B000ICLRIE|4.0|If you want to see a good action/adventure/drama type film then this  is the one for you.  The cinematography, action sequences, and music are great.  The movie centers one one character, Balian, as he journeys to Jerusalem in search of salvation and answers to some of life's questions.  The movie does offer some interesting philosophical insights or questions that we all probably ask ourselves concerning faith and religion.      This movie is not an accurate portrayal of the crusades. The characters in the movies and the period it is set during (the second crusade) did exist.  But, as is typical with Hollywood and political correctness, they depict the Christians as the aggressors and the Muslims as the noble warriors.  The Muslims were extremely cruel in their treatment of Christians and Jews.  They also started the crusades when they invaded Jerusalem and moved in on the Byzantine Empire, murdering any who did not accept Muslim rule.  The Byzantine Emperor asked the Pope for help and that is when the Pope sanctioned the first crusade.  The first crusaders defeated the Muslims (and yes they did massacre everyone within the city) and Jerusalem remained under Christian for about a hundred years until the time of the second crusade which is when this movie is set.  The second crusade did not begin because a bunch of knights set out to start a war.  There were aggressors on both sides.  The fact is, the Muslims are ordered by their religion to spread sharia law and Mohammad himself left orders that Jerusalem be taken under Muslim rule. Muslims took the city of Jerusalem during the second crusade and when Richard the Lion-heart headed to Jerusalem in the third crusade, he lost miserably.  There were other crusades fought in the Middle East but not all of them were over Jerusalem.        One thing the movie gets right are some of the reasons why people went to the crusades.  Europe was in shambles at that time and Jerusalem, while controlled by Christians, gave people achance to better their circumstances.  There were those that went for fame, power, glory, wealth, greed, but their were also those that went for spiritual reasons seeking salvation, or trying to discover something about themselves.      Like I said, do not take this movie as an accurate portrayal of history.  However, it is a good movie and worth watching.  But make sure you watch the director's cut and not the theatrical version.  It gives more insight in the character's lives and back stories explaining more of why they do what they do.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|My wife and I agree, this time.  Disney's 1951 animated feature is the best version of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" ever put on the silver screen.  In its re-mastered form the audio and video are just sensational.  And all the old characters, like Ed Wynn, as the Mad Hatter; Sterling Holloway, as the Cheshire Cat; Jerry Colona, as the March Hare; and even Kathryn Beaumont, as Alice, are brighter than ever before.  What is a puzzle, frankly, is why movie makers keep trying to improve on this rendition of the story.  How do you improve on perfection?    Another really nice thing about this DVD are all the Special Features that have background on the making of the 1951 film and various promos and extras.  Included in the latter are clips from the heart-warming, \\"Song of the South,\\" also by Disney Studios.  How anyone could take exception to this film as racist or negative toward African Americans is another mystery.  It's almost criminal to keep this feature from being made available to the viewing public because a few ultra-sensitive people find negative tones in the show.  Moreover, the visionary, Walt Disney, would never tolerate racism and it's an insult to his memory to say otherwise.    Back on \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" go buy this DVD even if you have prior versions taped or recorded some other way.  The sound and picture of the newly-released edition is more than worth the money.  The music, alone, makes the movie a winner.  Then add in all the comedy and story-telling and you have a masterpiece.  My wife and I give this DVD five (5) stars.  --Jim Wheeler, Tucson, Arizona, USA
B00009N83U|3.0|Clint Eastwood is the man when he shows off his act of intimidation, whether he would be a traditional cowboy, a cop, a retired boxer, or a racist war veteran.  \\"Pink Cadillac\\" proved to me that if he tries to be anything besides a silent brute, he's out of his element.  Watching his attempt at being funny in a zany action-comedy is nothing short of embarrassing; not to say he's never been an amusing character for his other films, but his humor mostly stems from cynicism, and him trying to sash-talk his way against a spunky love-interest in this film didn't work for him.  From dressing a rodeo clown and a casino king (who looks like a bleached John Waters) to mocking a woman's voice, his delivery towards these 'funny moments' are poorly handled.<br /><br />The film is about a master-of-disguise bounty hunter named Tommy Nowak, though he called himself a 'skip tracer' but if he's off chasing criminals so he can sent them to court for cash, that sounds like work of a bounty hunter to me.  He reluctantly goes after an escape fugitive named Lou Ann (Bernadette Peters), who was inexplicably involved in collecting counterfeit money which were actually responsible by her jerk of a husband and the Birthright, a type of Aryan brotherhood.  The money's in her [movie title], which the Birthright was after, but Nowak found her first. He decided to protect her and keep her hidden from the law, presumably because she was cute in \\"The Jerk\\"; otherwise, he had no real reason to have a change of heart from being a typical stern bounty hunter besides romantic convenience.  He gets involved in the Aryan's battles, leading into weak car chases and a haphazard conclusion.<br /><br />Although this probably Eastwood's weakest film in his repertoire, the film is not bad.  It's simply corny, particularly with the acting.  Again, Eastwood's comedic performance didn't go in his favor and Peters tried to be compelling with her sugary lisp voice, and the result of that is quite sour. The biggest offense were the bad guys, who were reaching the expertise of B-level cinema.  Malposo-produced films usually have cold and relentless antagonists, but the enemies in this movie are cartoonishly evil that they put me at a distance.  The leader of the Birthright, Alex, is so over-the-top, it's like I'm watching an bad 80s action film.  Maybe that's the idea of this film, but it didn't succeed in delivering the camp factors.  The whole film felt like a middling effort, but at least it had the grace of showing a young Jim Carrey doing stand-up, which showed how little he changed over the years.he bad guys, who were reaching the expertise of B-level cinema.

0143038419|5.0|Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert is a daring story that exceeded my expectations. It is about discovery, spontaneity, and seizing the endless joy within our reach. On another level, the book is a profound introspection on the choices we make in our lives. We all want to have uncomplicated things: a place to belong, a person to love, and an opportunity to tap into our deepest potential. The author searches for these things overseas, and it becomes a remarkable adventure. As Elizabeth travels on her journey to Italy, India and Indonesia, I could sense layer after layer of her former self peeling away like paint, exposing true innocence underneath. If you are seeking to read an intimate and circumspect account about that most human of desires, yearning, then this would be an impeccable choice. The writing is intelligent, moving and achingly profound, and the book will make you think about how you can make decisions that will dramatically change your life. This is a reminder of how miracles are always dancing right in front of our noses. We can take a step and join the celebration. A really enjoyable book, highly recommended.<br /><br />Reviewed by: C.J. Good, Author
0767802470|5.0|When I tried to watch Das Boot many-many years ago, it took way too long to get going and the only way for an English speaker to enjoy it was with subtitles. So I could never get passed the first 20 minutes. This DIRECTOR'S CUT with English dubbing is really great. I love WWII history and this moving has the real feel of the period. It highlights the disappointment of lack of support, and the difficulties of tight conditions on a sub with a bunch of young men (that could be German or Allies: all of these WWII boys went through the same miseries). The depth-charge scenes are cringing. And what an ending. One of those movies that you keep thinking about. So very glad I decided to give it another try.
B003E48AYC|4.0|I've written a review of the film elsewhere -- it should be under the DVD reviews, dated in early March.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray... It's an improvement over the theatrical 3D version, as there are no glasses to dim the image, or cause a slight color shift. It is a beautiful film that takes full advantage of CGI and digital grading to create a plausible fantasy world. (Bayard the hound is particularly remarkable.) The transfer is gorgeous.<br /><br />My feelings about the film itself have not changed. Carroll's story is impossible to film in any way that's consistent with what we commonly expect from a motion picture. It's little more than a sequence of disconnected events, with no particular dramatic arc. This adaptation might not be ideal, but it's better than most -- there's a coherent storyline, and the overall approach is adult and on the dark side, as you would expect from a Tim Burton film. It is an acceptable and generally entertaining adaptation, which is why I've given it 4 stars. As other people will likely weight the film's strengths and weakness differently, their opinions will differ.<br /><br />One of the best things about the original story is that Alice has always been a plucky, argumentative character who's not easily intimidated -- so there's never been a need to redefine her in \\"feminist\\" terms. She only has to recover a bit of her \\"muchness\\" to face the Jabberwock -- Which, for some unknown reason, is referred to as the \\"Jabberwocky\\". How can Linda Wolverton /not/ have known the latter is the title of the poem -- not the monster?<br /><br />Lewis Carroll would probably have been less bothered by the changes to the story than by the more-explicit violence. (The original has a lot of nasty behavior and implied violence.) However, as a mathematician, he would undoubtedly been fascinated by our ability to model things as numbers, and manipulate them as desired.<br /><br />PS: The Mad Hatter's recitation of \\"Jabberwocky\\" has several significant errors. Why weren't they caught?
1400052173|4.0|Rebecca Skloot's book is essentially three books in one: a science book, a family saga and a reporter's quest. The science -- and the story of Henrietta Lacks, the woman who unknowingly gave her cancer cells to science -- is fascinating. Mammoth scientific achievements that are hard to wrap your mind around, like the cure for polio, are framed by this story of a woman who died young, but whose cells live on in research labs around the world.<br /><br />It's the science story I liked the best, as well as what little could be known about Henrietta herself, a poor African-American wife and mother living in Baltimore. I also enjoyed much of Skloot's quest. It always interests me how a writer gets a story. Just think of Woodward and Bernstein. Their quest ([[ASIN:1416522913 All the President's Men]]) was as much the story as Watergate itself.<br /><br />To a point, I also liked the chapters dealing with Henrietta's family. The author makes a salient point -- that this family whose matriarch is contributing so much to our medical knowledge can't afford health insurance to treat diseases that are being studied and conquered through research involving her cells.<br /><br />But this is a fractious and angry family, one that is difficult to warm up to. It's a family whose many crises have nothing to do with Henrietta Lacks's cells. That Skloot hung in there with them is admirable. I enjoyed the chapter in which she sets up a meeting in a Johns Hopkins lab, where a grateful researcher shows two family members vials of the cells and looks at the cells under a microscope with them. The family's humanity shines through here. Elsewhere, their combativeness just made me want to close the book on them.<br /><br />Still, the value in this kind of book is to put a human face on often remote concepts of science. For that, we can all be grateful to Rebecca Skloot. For another take on immortality, you might try  [[ASIN:0060765364 Long for This World: The Strange Science of Immortality]] by Jonathan Weiner. The two books intersect at a few points, especially around the science of cell division.books intersect at a few points, especially around the science of cell division.

0439023491|5.0|This is the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy. Katniss has survived the 74th Hunger Games, but the Capitol is PISSED. And who do they think should pay? Katniss, of course!<br /><br />I won't give too much away, but anyone who's read the first book knows that Katniss and Peeta are going on their victory tour, and that they are supposed to become mentors for the next round of District 12 tributes. What they don't realize until it's too late is that they ARE the tributues for the 75th Hunger Games, because this is a Quarter Quell, meaning the Capitol can put in any twist they want, and this year, they want previous victors.<br /><br />It should be warned that this book ends in a nasty cliffhanger. If you read it, you WILL want to read Mockingjay, the final book in the triology, due out August 24th. I know I can't wait. Suzanne Collins is an outstanding author.

1591843162|5.0|Great thinkers are so valuable; Seth Godin is one of the most innovative thinkers of our day.  His latest book, `Linchpin: Are You Indispensable' is full of amazing and valuable insights.<br /><br />Here is the synopsis of this thought-provoking book:<br /><br />\\"The only way to get what you're worth is to stand out, to exert emotional labor, to be seen as indispensable, and to produce interactions that organizations and people care deeply about.\\"<br />In bestsellers such as Purple Cow and Tribes, Seth Godin taught readers how to make remarkable products and spread powerful ideas.  But this book is different.  It's about you - your choices, your future, and your potential to make a huge difference in whatever field you choose.<br />There used to be two teams in every workplace: management and labor.  Now there's a third team, the linchpins.  These people invent, lead (regardless of title), connect others, make things happen, and create order out of chaos.  They figure out what to do when there's no rule book.  They delight and challenge their customers and peers.  They love their work, pour out their best selves into it, and turn every day into a kind of art.<br />Linchpins are the essential building blocks of great organizations.  Like the small piece of hardware that keeps a wheel from falling off its axle, they may not get the best jobs and the most freedom.<br />Have you ever found a shortcut that others missed?  Seen a new way to resolve a conflict?  Made a connection with someone others couldn't reach?  Even one?  Then you have what it takes to become indispensable, by overcoming the resistance that holds people back....<br />As Godin writes, \\"Every time I meet people who have so much to give but have been bullied enough or frightened enough to hold it back.  It's time to stop complying with the system and draw your own map.  You have brilliance in you, your contribution is essential, and the art you create is precious.  Only you can do it, and you must.\\"<br /><br />And here's Seth talking about `Linchpin:'<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Here is the biography of the author:<br /><br />Seth Godin is the author of Tribes, The Dip, Purple Cow, All Marketers are Liars, Permission Marketing, and other international bestsellers that have changed the way businesspeople think and act.  He's the most influential business blogger in the world and consistently one of the twenty-five most widely read bloggers in the English language.  He's also the founder and CEO of [...]<br /><br /> and a very popular speaker.  He lives in Westchester, New York.<br /><br />Visit [...]and click on his head to read his blog.<br /><br />In the Introduction, Seth makes this assertion:<br /><br />The system we grew up with is a mess.  It's falling apart at the seams and a lot of people I care about are in pain because the things we thought would work won't.  Every day I meet people who have so much to give but have been bullied enough or frightened enough to hold it back.  They have become victims, pawns in a senseless system that uses them up and undervalues them. (p. 3)<br /><br />He describes and defines `linchpin' this way:<br /><br />This is your opportunity.  The indispensable employee brings humanity and connection and art to her organization.  She is the key player, the one who's difficult to live without, the person you can build something around.<br />You reject whining about the economy and force yourself to acknowledge that the factory job is dead.  Instead, you recognize the opportunity of becoming indispensable, highly sought after, and unique.  If a Purple Cow is a product that's worth talking about, the indispensable employee - I call her a linchpin - is a person who's worth finding and keeping. (p. 9)<br /><br />He goes on to explain how the old way our society operated is obsolete:<br /><br />The system we grew up with is based on a simple formula: Do your job.  Show up.  Work hard.  Listen to the boss.  Stick it out.  Be part of the system.  You'll be rewarded.<br />That's the scam.  Strong words, but true.  You've been scammed.  You traded years of your life to be part of a giant con in which you are most definitely not the winner.<br />If you've been playing that game, it's no wonder you're frustrated.  That game is over.<br />There are no longer any great jobs where someone else tells you precisely what to do. (p. 14)<br /><br />Being a lifelong resident of Michigan - in the heart of the `Rust Belt' - I have seen how the labor and management have operated in a factory environment.  It is not at all surprising that a system that rewards someone with a `tenured' position when they are not productive should fail.  It goes against what success should be all about.  One should not work as a robot, not should one be treated as one.<br /><br />Here Seth explains the oddity of factory work:<br /><br />Having a factory job is not a natural state.  It wasn't at the heart of being a human until recently.  We've been culturally brainwashed to believe that accepting the hierarchy and lack of responsibility that comes with a factory job is the one way, the only way, and the best way. (p. 17)<br /><br />Seth explains how the means of production these days - a laptop - have changed everything:<br /><br />Today, the means of production = a laptop computer with Internet connectivity.  Three thousand dollars buys a worker an entire factory.<br />This change is a fundamental shift in power and control.  When you can master the communication, conceptual, and connectivity elements of the new work, then you have more power than management does.  And if management attracts, motivates, and retain good talent, then it has more leverage than the competition.<br />It starts with bloggers, musicians, writers and others who don't need anyone's support or permission to do their thing. (p. 24)<br /><br />As a blogger writing this review on a laptop, all I can say to that is \\"Hear, hear\\"!!<br /><br />Seth explains how one is to stand out and become an indispensable linchpin:<br /><br />You have no right to that job or that career.  After years of being taught that you have to be an average worker for an average organization, that society should support you for sticking it out, you discover that the rules have changed.  The only way to succeed is to be remarkable, to be talked about.  But when it comes to a person, what do you talk about?  People are not producers with features, benefits, and viral marketing campaigns; they are individuals.  If we're going to talk about them, we're going to discuss what they do, not who they are.<br />You don't become indispensable merely because you are different.  But the only way to be indispensable is to be different.  That's because if you're the same, so are plenty of other people.<br />The only way to get what you're worth is to stand out, to exert emotional labor, to be seen as indispensable, and to produce interactions that organizations and people can care about. (pp. 26-27)<br /><br />Seth provides a list of what you will get if you want certain things in a job:<br /><br />If you want a job where it's okay to follow the rules, don't be surprised if you get a job where following the rules is all you get to do.<br />If you want a job where the people who work for you do exactly what they're told, don't be surprised if your boss expects precisely the same thing from you.<br />If you want a job where you get to do more than follow instructions, don't be surprised if you get asked to do things they never taught you in school.<br />If you want a job where you take intellectual risks all day long, don't be surprised if your insights get you promoted. (pp. 29-30)<br /><br />Seth asserts that schools teach people to practice mediocre obedience:<br /><br /> We've been taught to be a replaceable cog in a giant machine.<br /> We've been taught to consume as a shortcut to happiness.<br /> We've been taught not to care about our jobs or our customers.<br /><br />And we've been taught to fit in.<br /><br />None of these things helps you get what you deserve.<br />We've bought into a model that taught us to embrace the system, to spend for pleasure, and to separate ourselves from our work.  We've been taught that this approach works, but it doesn't (not anymore).  And this disconnect keeps us from succeeding, cripples the growth of our society, and makes us really stressed. (p. 39)<br /><br />Instead, he thinks schools only need to teach two things:<br /><br />1. Solve interesting problems<br />2. Lead<br /><br />Seth explains that children start out as Superhero, are trained to be Mediocreman - but we need to go back to being a Superhero:<br /><br />If you're insecure, the obvious response to my call to become a linchpin is, \\"I'm not good enough at anything to be indispensable.\\"  The typical indoctrinated response is that great work and great art and remarkable output are the domain of someone else.  You think that your job is to do the work that needs doing, anonymously.<br />Of course, that isn't true, but it's what we've been taught to believe.<br />I've been lucky enough to meet or work with thousands of remarkable linchpins.  It appears to me that the only way they differ from a mediocre rule-follower is that they never bought into this self-limiting line of thought.  That's it.<br />Perhaps they had a great teacher who lit a lamp for them.  Perhaps a parent or a friend pushed them to refuse to settle.  Regardless, the distinction between cogs and linchpins is largely one of attitude, not learning. (pp. 42-43).<br /><br />Seth explains that the work people have been taught to behave in the workplace is ineffective and damaging:<br /><br />For generations, we've been pushing workers to do something inherently unnatural.  We've been teaching, cajoling, and yes, forcing people to hide their empathy and their creativity and to pretend that they are fast-moving automatons, machines designed to do the company's bidding.<br />It's not necessary.  No, I'll go further than that: it's damaging.  It's damaging to have to put on a new face for work, the place we spend our days.  It's damaging to build organizations around repetitive faceless work that brings no connection and no joy. (p. 71)<br /><br />Mr. Godin is convinced that we should be artists in the marketplace, and not just in the artist's studio:<br /><br />I think art is the ability to change people with your work, to see things as they are and then create stories, images, and interactions that change the marketplace.  So, yes, I do think you need to be an artist to market tofu, if you want to be any good at all. (p. 91)<br /><br />Seth contends that there are two parts of us at work - the lizard brain and the daemon:<br /><br />The voice in your head has revealed the resistance.  It is trying to teach the daemon [a Greek term; what the Romans called \\"the genius\\"] a lesson, encouraging it to be more careful next time.  The lizard hates your genius, and tries to stamp it out.  When you hear the dialogue, don't listen to it.  Remember that it serves as proof of the resistance, and guard yourself even more diligently to ignore it.  (p. 113)<br /><br />I agree with the concept here, but not the terminology.  Looking at this from a Christian worldview (as opposed to an evolutionary worldview), I see the resistance as being the devil.  Regardless of the difference in semantics, I agree with the point Seth is making here.<br /><br />Seth is convinced that winners have this trait:<br /><br />You become a winner when you're good at losing.  The hard part about losing is that you might permit it to give strength to the resistance, that you might believe that you don't deserve to win, that you might, in some dark corner of your soul, give up.<br />Don't. (p. 115)<br /><br />He goes on:<br /><br />Once you've given a name to the resistance and you know what its voice sounds like, it's a lot easier to embrace the fact that you actually area genius.  The part of you that wants to deny that is the resistance.  The rest of you understands that you're as capable as the next guy of an insight, invention, or connection that makes a difference. (p. 118)<br /><br />In other words, we're fearfully and wonderfully made in the image of God. (Psalm 139:14)<br /><br />Seth believes that we need to be generous with ourselves and others:<br /><br />So what's smart?  Living life without regret.<br />Now that you know what to call the fear that has held you back all these years, what are you going to choose to do about the resistance?  Now that you understand society rewards you for standing out, for giving gifts, for making connections and being remarkable, what are you going to do with that information?<br />You have a genius inside of you, a daemon with something to share with the world.  Everyone does.  Are you going to continue hiding it, holding it back, and settling for less than you deserve just because your lizard brain is afraid?<br />There lies regret. (p. 233)<br /><br />He concludes this way:<br /><br />The result of this art, these risks, the gifts, and the humanity coming together is both wonderful and ironic.  The result of getting back in touch with our pre-commercial selves will actually create a post-commercial world that feeds us, enriches us, and gives us the stability we've been seeking for so long. (p. 236)<br />I was amazed by this book; believe it or not, I had to restrain myself from including more quotes than I already have!  The thoughts are so profound.  This is the first book by Mr. Godin that I have read.  I have heard some amazing things about his work, so I knew I wanted to read this latest.  I was not disappointed.  It is worthwhile to me to go back and read his previous books, and to keep an eye out for new ones from this innovative thinker.

B001HN694K|3.0|As others have noted, there was a huge pile of money spent on effects and visuals here, as well as on costumes.  At least there is a good cast.      The main problem is that it all seems so familiar.  I thought the Tweedles had arrived straight from Nightmare Before Christmas, the twisted tree might have been left over from Sleepy Hollow, and the music sounds like most of the music of Burton's other films.  And of course, there is Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter.  Again.    And what was with the blending of the poem \\"jabberwocky\\" with the story of Alice?   That just didn't work at all for me.
B002ZG9760|5.0|Okay, since I saw the preview for this film I've been anxiously awaiting the film release. The original release date was 7/30/10 but because of Zac Efron's film, the studio has delayed his girlfriend's (Vanessa Hudgen's)Beastly to dates unknown. While I cannot believe that actor's personal lives are being factored into release dates for films, I read the book & loved it. For that reason alone I gave it 5 stars. There was a passing reference that the soundtrack may be available on 1/4/11, so the film may actually hit theatres on 1/7/11. After such date, I'll re-review.    I think the true breakout star for this film is going to be Alex Pettyfer. American audiences haven't seen him before unless they've been checking out British films or into fashion magazines. This film will easily do for Alex what Twilight did for Robert Pattinson, and then some.     The best of luck to him... he's going to need it. Once American girls (& women) have a look at him, I can only imagine...
0891419063|5.0|I began reading Eugene Sledge's personal memoir after I received it as a birthday gift from a friend.  I am a big World War II buff, and am proud to have knowledge of all the major actions and events that took place.  As a result, I went into With the Old Breed thinking that I knew it all.  Boy was I wrong.  Yes, Sledge depicts two of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific Theatre, Peleliu and Okinawa, but he goes far beyond that.  From describing the constant fear of being killed at night by Japanese infiltrators, to grimacing in fear under enemy artillery fire, and to bear the sight of dead Marines, Sledge truly reveals the horrors of combat.  One of the main accomplishments in his writing is proving that combat is much more than a simple John Wayne movie.  It is a test of will that can push any man to the limit, no matter how strong he may be.  Sledge's story is also one of friendship and camaraderie, forming strong ties with his fellow marines who will risk anything to save their buddies.  This is also a story of hate however, and Sledge does an excellent job pointing out the fact that the Marines were not the sophisticated soldiers of western society, but often times sink down to the level of their own adversaries.  Sledge's war was one where anyone was a target on the battlefield, even stretcher bearers and medics.  The Japanese were a ruthless enemy, and Sledge time and time points out that the only way to defeat them is to \\"root 'em out one by one.\\"  The most remarkable part of the memoir is Sledge's transformation from a scared recruit wading ashore on Peleliu to a combat veteran who came to the realization that war is not pretty, and that he has to do unspeakable things in order to survive.  Read this book as a testament to all Americans who died fighting in the deadliest conflict in human history.
0786886811|4.0|Interesting book about baking (although what baking and being a domestic goddess have to do with each other, I'm not sure).  Great pix, and I must disagree with some of the other reviewers: the recipes are pretty easy to follow.    Maybe I'm just cynical, but does anyone really think that married-to-a-billionaire-Nigella has made all of these recipes?  Just saying...

Still, it is a nice movie, and the scenery in Ireland made me want to go ASAP.  :)    I think Hilary Swank is a great actress, but in this one...it's a lot of overacting.  Oh, well.

B003102JDM|5.0|\\"A Serious Man\\" is a seriously underrated gem of a film. This tale of lessons in acceptance is told through the adventures of Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), a middle-aged, middle class Jewish everyman who tries to do well by everybody but who is perpetually dumped on by family, friends and colleagues, no matter how hard he tries to please them. But no matter how dark the clouds, there always seems to be a silver lining, too -- that is, until another dark cloud comes along.    Set in the Minneapolis suburbs in the 1960s, the film is a great period piece as well, full of lots of pop culture references of the time and a great soundtrack. The Coen Brothers have written and directed a great flick here, peppered with wry wit and all the usual quirkiness typical of their signature style.     The film was praised by many critics and earned an Oscar nod for best picture, though it deserved far more accolades than it received.  Thankfully, now that it's on DVD, it has a chance to reach a wider audience -- one that I hope truly appreciates this movie for the great piece of filmmaking that it truly is.

0785134352|5.0|Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr. have done in comics what Jack Ketchum (Offspring) or Jeff Lindsay (the Dexter novels) did in novels: go the extra step by graphically depicting brutality rather than glossing over it. Combined with a clever premise and novel characters, the result is impressive, disturbing, and most definitely not-for-kids, much as they probably would like it.    Readers who first have seen the movie will get a few surprises. Much of the dialogue in the movie is lifted directly from the Kick-Ass comics without modification. Many of the scenes are shot to look nearly identical to various illustrated frames. Yet, there are distinct and interesting differences, no doubt because, as Dave Lizewski (aka Kick-Ass) says in issue #1, \\"What works on the page doesn't always work on the screen.\\" The backstory of the character Big Daddy takes an unexpected turn, for example, though I'll leave it for the reader to discover or other reviewers to reveal. Dave's relationship with Katie Deauxma is far less pleasant in print than in film, and more credible.    For all its darkness, the book is funny. \\"How does a ten-year-old girl get her hands on a flame-thrower?\\" Dave asks. Hit-Girl answers casually, \\"eBay.\\" This graphic novel is not for everyone, and definitely is not for the squeamish. If you're the type of reader who is likely to show up at a Comic Con convention, however, it probably is for you.
0756405890|2.0|I'm completely mystified by this book.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first quarter of the book, but then the book just fell apart.<br /><br />First, Denna.  Are we supposed to enjoy reading about the maddening and nonsensical non-relationship between Kvothe and Denna?  I couldn't decide if I was supposed to like Denna or see her as the evil temptress our hero's misplaced love for whom will bring about about his downfall.  In the end I'm still not sure, and Denna remains a non-person, a sketch of a character with little to recommend her.  I found myself disconnecting from Kvothe because of her.  It wasn't just that she was unworthy of his affections, although that's true.  It wasn't just that Kvothe was such an inept, passive, fumbling, virginal twit when it came to pursuing (or decidedly not pursuing her).  A little bit of that as part of a growing process in a teenaged character makes sense.  But it was that the book seemed to focus completely unselfconsciously and without irony on a clueless teenager in the friend-zone with a troubled, wounded-bird-type teenaged girl.  Is high school drama of this low variety what we really want in a fantasy novel?<br /><br />2nd, the Chandrian.  Has there ever been as mystifyingly unscary and uninteresting a supernatural villain as the Chandrian?  After (almost) finishing the first book, I could care the less about them.  And the fact that I didn't find the Chandrian a compelling villain took away from the tragicness of the death of Kvothe's parents and made me ambivalent toward his desire for revenge.  And those terrible nursery rhymes that hold the key to understanding them (what's their plan? What's their plan? Chandrian ugh).  Not well done.<br /><br />3rd, the world.  I know really next to nothing about the world Kvothe lives in.  I don't know the politics, history, much of the culture or anything about the surrounding nations.  There are plenty of fantasies that are intentionally vague about faraway lands, but this doesn't seem to be something purposeful here, but rather something the author just didn't have time for.<br /><br />4th, the writing.  What the heck was the point of this long, wandering interlude where Kvothe goes to the village to investigate the wedding massacre?  This book has no pacing or focus.  It speeds up, slows down.  Rothfuss adds characters that don't contribute anything to the plot and then forgets about them.  The dialogue is snappy at some points, but at others it is completely incongruous with the setting, e.g. \\"witty\\" romantic banter while standing in the aftermath of a massacre or facing down a drug-addled lizard (seriously?!??!!!?).<br /><br />All in all, I read the book, and at times I was completely drawn in.  I would say the 2nd half of the book was extremely disappointing.  I think that the author had an unfinished manuscript with some potential, and his editor did him a disservice by publishing it as is.  For a good first book in a series that's a bit long and winding look at The Darkness that Comes Before.  Compare how much happens in that book with how much happens in the Name of the Wind.poseful here, but rather something the author just didn't have time for.      4th, the writing.

The dialogue is snappy at some points, but at others it is completely incongruous with the setting, e.g. \\"witty\\" romantic banter while standing in the aftermath of a massacre or facing down a drug-addled lizard (seriously?!??!!!?).    All in all, I read the book, and at times I was completely drawn in.  I would say the 2nd half of the book was extremely disappointing.  I think that the author had an unfinished manuscript with some potential, and his editor did him a disservice by publishing it as is.  For a good first book in a series that's a bit long and winding look at The Darkness that Comes Before.  Compare how much happens in that book with how much happens in the Name of the Wind.
0691142165|4.0|A reeling financial system and unprecedented bailouts; a stock market collapse the worst since 1929; plunging real estate prices; unemployment ratcheting up. Sound familiar? I'm referring to the Savings and Loan crisis of the 1980s, the stock market crash of 1987, the real estate tumble in 1988, and the recession that technically lasted until 1992 though it felt longer at the time. I remember especially a peculiar period in 1988 when housing seemed to defy the general downturn. The arguments prevalent in my own real estate industry were that the fundamentals no longer applied to housing, so prices would hold up. Americans, it was said, were a nation of homeowners who viewed houses as a \\"safe haven\\" investment; prices were therefore decoupled from rents and other traditional ways of determining value. So, prices might stall, but (except perhaps in second-home markets such as Florida) wouldn't drop substantially. The fundamentals had the last laugh: they applied with a vengeance and homeowners took a beating.<br /><br />Lesson: whenever folks start telling you the fundamentals don't apply, head for the exits. Whenever it seems \\"this time is different\\" for reasons X, Y, and Z, X, Y, and Z are sure to have a good laugh.<br /><br />This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly by Princeton economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff is a very valuable contribution to the literature on the current financial crisis - and on the future ones that certainly will come. Much of the book, full of charts and explanations of methodology and data sources, necessarily is dry, but this is what gives the authors' argument scholarly substance and credibility. I highly recommend it, even (perhaps especially) for non-economists.<br /><br />Financial crises, Reinhart and Rogoff convincingly demonstrate, are recurrent \\"equal opportunity crises\\" that take place in every type of economy and regulatory environment. They happen in advanced economies as well as emerging ones, in largely free market unregulated economies, and in heavily managed ones. There are, however, warning signs when one is imminent, and by 2006 every single one of them in the USA was flashing bright red. In retrospect, it seems that any informed and reasonable person should have seen them. (I didn't, despite 1988.) The authors attribute the refusal of investors and of policy-makers alike to acknowledge the signals to a this-time-is-different confidence that \\"the old rules of valuation no longer apply\\" because of changes in capital markets, in regulation, in the globalization of trade, in central bank policy, in the (to use Alan Greenspan's term) robustness of modern financial institutions, and in, well, X, Y, and Z. The this-time-is-different syndrome has been a feature of every financial crisis for the past several hundred years.<br /><br />(Just out of curiosity, I'd like to know how the authors' own investments fared 2007-2008, though that doesn't affect the validity of their argument one way or another.)<br /><br />The authors address sovereign debts and defaults as well as private ones, and, in 2009 made one prescient call. They say it \\"remains to be seen\\" if EU institutions are able to prevent full-blown default crises in clearly at-risk countries such as Greece and Portugal.<br /><br />The final analysis is sobering. Financial crises like the current one will happen again, and no magic mix of regulation and policies will prevent them. Next time will not be different. Rather, \\"a financial system can collapse under the pressure of greed, politics, and profits no matter how well regulated it seems to be.\\" The authors are not without recommendations, however. \\"Even if crises are inevitable, there must be at least some basic insights that we can gather from such an extensive review of financial folly.\\" Policy does matter: it can mitigate the consequences of crises or make them much worse.<br /><br />For private investors, the obvious points to take away are 1) try toavoid the this-time-is-different mindset in the run-up to the next crisis, and 2) try to avoid it in the one after that, too.to the next crisis, and 2) try to avoid it in the one after that, too.
0393072231|5.0|Once again, truth is stranger than fiction, & Michael Lewis just nails the story, the quirky characters involved, & of course, this very dysfunctional industry.  Please note that the average score on this book would be about 4.9 except for numerous malcontents who gave it one star simply because it wasn't available on kindle.  I love my kindle, too, but please get over it & judge the books on its merits.
