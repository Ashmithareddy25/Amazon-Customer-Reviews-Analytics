B0084IHVC0|5.0|I'm not really a cat person, but I love this movie.  Thomas O'Malley is Baloo's voice from &#34;The Jungle Book&#34;, so I like that right off the bat.  The little kittens are so cute, they all have so much character.  Great characters is what makes this movie, it's not like the animation is as beautiful as some other disney masterpieces, it's a more rough style of animation like &#34;101 Dalmatians &#34;.  Catchy songs.  Can't wait to see how good the blu-ray looks.  Story may not be the best for little ones, but they do it in such a way that I don't think they would notice or be offended, but I'm not a kid, so the butler and his bad intentions may bother someone.

B0054R6BFM|5.0|I just finished this book and honestly its the best thing I have ever read. The plot line is clever, and makes you want to keep reading, and whenever Hannah is talking its so creepy, yet sad. Character's who all play a part in Hannah's fatal decision bring together the story together for an amazing  addictive read for teens I am 12 and i am absolutely in love with this!!!

B00CWY76CC|5.0|keeps the wheels turning.  Great for keeping the brain.  Great fun for all ages! Please keep creating more fun levels.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I am an older woman who still loves any good music, regardless of genre. As a musician myself, I KNOW good music when I hear it. This band was new to me until someone (who currently plays in a rock band) told me I would like them. I listened to their song, \\"Sound of Madness\\" on UTube and was sold! They are unique, highly talented, and in my opinion, one of the best bands out there today. Good album!
B009PNQUXO|2.0|I feel this app wasn't really worth it, this app only had downloaded a couple minutes of your selected videos. Now, I'm especially glad that this app was free. I also understand some of you may be questioning why I put two stars instead of one. This is because even when I turned off my device, it continued downloading but, of course this was ruined when I found out that if you tapped outside of the downloading notification (that let you know how much your video was downloaded) then, it would stop downloading. Rendering the few minutes of your video, gone...  :(
1451624468|5.0|I am into my second reading of this book and understanding it better this time. I have subscribed to the &#34;Big Bang Theory&#34; of creation for some time, even before I knew it was called the &#34;Big Bang Theory.&#34; I actually found the &#34;Afterword&#34; by Richard Dawkins to be very informative, and he helped me to better understand what Krauss was trying to convey. You might want to read it first! Many people will diss this book because it is atheistic, or so they think. I actually believe there was a divine creator of some sort (whatever you want to call Him/Her/It) who caused the &#34;big bang&#34; in the beginning. Even the Bible speaks of the void and the world being without form........It is a bit unnerving, though, to gaze at a the beautiful night sky with a telescope and realize that the distant galaxies, etc., you see are as they were 5 billion years ago and that they might not even be there now. If you have a closed mind, don't buy this book, but if you believe as I do - that we really don't know anything for sure - then you will find this book fascinating. The Hubble telescope cannot lie!
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|When I try to play the game it keeps force closing me. It used to let play it until I accidentally updated it. And now it doesn't work. I'm not very happy with you Amazon and the developer of this game.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I always forget to rate. If you have not seen this you'll enjoy. I think I have watched it at least 2 maybe 3 times now. Still not old.
B00B7807PM|4.0|I was hesitant to keep watching Downton Abbey after the second season, which I felt greatly lacked good writing. But after watching the third season, I knew that the show I fell in love with from season 1 was back! I'm not a big fan of period shows, but this one really keeps me entertained. I really liked the arrival of Cora's mother, Martha, the Jimmy/Thomas story line, Matthew and Mary's relationship, and of course the Dowager Countess. There were still a few pointless and dull episode arcs, but otherwise, I really enjoyed the show. If you're hesitant like me to keep watching after season 2, don't be! After the end of this season, I'm really looking forward to season 4.
B00422LESO|5.0|As a bonifide  Jane Austen addict, I can not speak highly enough about this story!  This is a great read for anyone who has ever dreamed of finding their own Mr. Darcy.  It was funny and sweet, throughout the story Austen's characters and story lines are woven together for one delicious ride.  Anyone who ever dreamed of being a part of this world will be pleasantly surprised.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|Bought it but when I try to play it just shuts down  it was a big waste of time and money
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This used to be a great app.  I used it every day and found it clear, concise and very reliable.  The new upgrade which I guess was supposed to be an improvement is an absolute joke.  It is now like something that a fly by night company would put together.  I have switched to the weather bug but would switch back if the upgrade was deleted.  I don't know, I understand that things change and I usually go with the flow but I don't understand this upgrade which is in fact a downgrade.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Awesome game, fun for everyone. A good time killer as well, and addictive. Just want coins to be found easier.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Bad thing is you need gems for the good stuffGreat graphics quite enjoyable I recommend this app for all ages. Yay horeses
B007FH9GA6|4.0|Very well cast movie - screen plat stayed true to the book itself.  Visually stimulating.  Look forward to the second and third in the trilogy.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The game is fun, albeit repetitive. I really enjoy the minigames and being able to increase the amount of characters you can play said minigames with. It does have its drawbacks however. Collection of certain materials (namely gems and hearts) can be tedious at times. Especially considering that there appears to be some bug with keeping connected to the social media sites that would allow you to receive said hearts. Another issue I came across involving bugs is the lack of respawning destructables in ponyville. Parasprites, rocks, and other objects that return daily in the iphone version never seem to do the same in the kindle version often leaving kindle users no choice but to spend the elusive gems on the quests involving said annoyances if they run out of the original (supposed) respawners. Overall, though I find the game enjoyable there need to be a few updates to patch up some remaining problems.
B00936A0RU|3.0|A crime drama \\"Lawless\\" (2012) has everything that would make a great picture: talented players, moody photography, nice soundtrack music, etc. The only thing it doesn't have is a screenplay, one of the most neglected departments in making a movie.<br /><br />Set in the Depression-era Virginia, \\"Lawless\\" chronicles the lives of the Bondurant brothers - Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke) and Jack Bondurant (Shia LaBeouf), running a moonshine business in Franklin County. With the arrival of corrupt Special Deputy Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce), their business becomes more difficult, but the brothers will not give in to pressure to bribe.<br /><br />Unlike Australian-born director John Hillcoat's previous work, a dark, post-apocalyptic tale \\"The Road,\\" \\"Lawless\\" attempts to be a serious artistic work that also entertains. The result is a mixed bag. While the visuals are always attractive, the film does not know where it really wants to go, with flat characters whose fates we do not care much. The romantic subplot involving Mia Wasikowska's characters is forgettable. Jack Bondurant's transformation is not really convincing.<br /><br />\\"Lawless\\" is just another example of how a story based on real-life figures could have been better. (And if you are a Gary Oldman fan like me, remember that his role is a small one, though he does a perfect job.)
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Add me I gift every day paulchestnutallen and also add my friend he also gifts ever day snakeistheking please and thank you
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game where you don't have to spend real money to have fun great graphics and sound cant wait to level up
B007ME5BUG|3.0|Very intersesting and detailed, I never knew WWII actually started in China been reading it for 4 monthes. Oh Well
B002J2PB10|4.0|Classic Tarantino but with too much talk.  The action sequences are great but only some of the dialogue is worth watching.  Too much &#34;chick talk&#34; frankly.  I suppose Quentin is building up the characters but the conversations are often rather dull and prolonged.  That being said, it is definitely worth watching or adding to your Tarantino collection if you are a fan.
B0009XRZ9M|5.0|I ordered this movie for my son, but I enjoy it as well. We watch it all year round, not just at Christmas time. It has 2 disc with special features & of course that beautiful song \\"believe\\" by Josh Groban.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Love this movie. My 20 year old daughter requested this for Xmas several years ago.  I had a hard time finding it, till I looked on Amazon.  Should have done that first.  She has watched it more times than I can count. I have watch it repeatedly!  Did I say we love it!
B0026QC0TA|4.0|This movie was the only John Grishman movie that I had not seen.  It did not disappoint.  Matt Damon did a good job.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Definitely a top recommendation of mine!! Simply amazing.. I'm speechless! I find myself not being able to put the book down! A must read!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Definitely a worthwhile read and really makes you think of the difference between two cultures. It is a pretty quick read as well
B00846REIS|4.0|I have read this book twice and find I feel sorry for the two main characters, Eva and Gideon.  As they go from one extreme to the other, happy and explosively angry, I just shake my head and wonder how they have gotten this far in life.  Not to mention Eva's best friend Cary (what a mess he is).  It also seems to me that the explosively angry times are just a set up for hot sex.  I understand a healthy sex life is important to relationships but sometimes their relationship seems to be nothing but sex and anger.  I am currently reading the second book and will review that one when I finish.  I have to admit I want to see how this relationship progresses.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The book is definitely better than the movie and I loved every part of it. I would defintely recommend it
B000W7JWUA|4.0|We bought the additional pieces to allow for more than 4 players and are so glad we did. We enjoy the rules for more players as it allows for a faster and more involved game. We play as much as we can. What fun.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|I hve seen all the &#34;die hard movies&#34; the story is a little far fetched but good action flick any ways. A little to short though
B00821PCJS|5.0|The scenes are intense and the story always seems to pull you along.<br /><br />Sometimes the computer animated mechs can be a little cheesy, but overall the show is well put together.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I am a Truck driver and around an excessive amount of noise on a daily biases, this earpiece solved the problem of people understanding what i am saying, works as they say or maybe even better. Thank you  P.S.  Make sure you buy the charging case for it as it is extremely handy and provides you with a safe place to store it when not in use.
B00BG08FKK|4.0|It reminded me of the movie. I could picture it when I played the discs. I play it nearly every day.
1594746036|5.0|this was recommended to me from another teacher, great story. The book came as promised and in a timely fashion. I would recommend to others.
B007L6VR12|1.0|I had heard great reviews about this movie.<br />It was like The Royal Tannenbalms.  Everyone loved it but me.<br />It's just not my style, I guess.  Not my sense of humor.
1568363931|5.0|This book is more than just a cookbook, it's a great starter guide for anyone interested in making bento boxes. The author has really great tips for the boxes, what goes in the boxes, the accessories for boxes, as well as how to pack everything into your box. I found the hygienic tips very useful, as well as the packing tips for different size boxes.<br /><br />The recipes themselves are also good looking, and would actually make some of them as fullblown dinners and not just bentos. Not going to lie, the Ginger Pork recipe made my mouth water just looking at it. The only disappointing thing is that recipes are in color on the front, main page, but then on the prep page the smaller instructional pictures are in black and white. The book is divided into Japanese-style recipes (helpful glossary in the back of all ingredients) and then ideas for more \\"American\\" style bento boxes. These recipes all seem pretty healthy and delicious as well. Pretty much any element is swappable for another, the fun thing about bento boxes is the ability to mix and match. All elements of the box have their preparation explained separately, and there's a timeline for all of the elements as well so you can decide what to make based on how much time you have.<br /><br />I think I'm going to really enjoy this book for both the recipes and the ideas it will provide for other bento ideas.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I have downloaded a few weather programs but by far my favorite is AccuWeather. There's a lot of different pages of interesting weather related items, so glad to have downloaded this one.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Zombies!<br /><br />It's a genre increasing in popularity, although lacking that vampire super-sexiness the stories told tend to be ones of survival in 'post-apocalyptic' world, the walking dead almost a metaphor for a too-complicated world that has turned on us for some reason (and wants to eat us).<br /><br />Max Brooks seems to have given the consequences of a zombie apocalypse a LOT of thought.<br /><br />&#34;World War Z&#34; is essentially a compendium of stories, as told by the survivors and those who worked to free the world of the undead scourge. It is is this wide and varied range of tales, and the skill and detail with which they are presented, that makes this such a great book.<br /><br />If you're looking for the same story as the Hollywood movie, you'll be disappointed; the movie seems to be a completely separate story that is drawn from the back-story of the same world (and with a different ending; in the book, there is no total victory).<br /><br />The &#34;interviews&#34; are with people pivotal to the human victory over the zombies, and they're from as far afield as North Korea, South Africa, Germany, Pakistan, India and of course, the USA.<br /><br />If you can get away from the inherent impossibility of the zombie plague (and it's easy to do so) then you'll love this book.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|easy app
B007SGM084|1.0|at first, it was a good read but after 4-5 chapters it's just ridiculously redundant. ok, i get it already!! she's in-loooooveee with Christian Grey and she can't believe he also feels the same... yes, he has his dark past buttt ohhhh ohhh 'my poor fifty' ..... damn story line just extended through the whole book, but the message was the same anyway. and i can't believe there are 3 books. i had to force myself to read all the way to the 3rd book since i paid for all 3 ( REMINDER:  NEVER BUY ALL 3 BOOKS AT ONCE), and come to think of it, i haven't even finished the 3rd or was it the 2nd, i don't even remember. sure the 'juicy parts' would get your libido high, what erotica novel wouldn't anyway? the sex every 3 pages becomes boring in the long haul. and besides, it was all, well, VANILLA. Annndd the writing.... i don't claim to be better in writing but if you're an author, i expect a damn descent writing. E.L James would use some words that would literally let you go on google to look up the meaning and then would suddenly drop to the level of redundancy. come on!! i've read better love stories and yes, better erotica novels than this.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Goodfellas is one of those movies I have to watch every time it's on. Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro are great together (Raging Bull & Casino two more of my favorites). Paul Sorvino and the rest of the supporting cast were so convincing as mobsters. Mix in Ray Liotta and you have one of the greatest movies ever made....
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Said I'd have to reload, but we were able to get Tom 2 instead. I'm not sure if the reason it didn't load is my fault or not.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Definitely my favorite TV show right now. Love this season, even though it was shorter. This is understandable given the circumstances. Can't wait for next season!!
0099572834|4.0|I hadn't heard about \\"The Curious Incident\\" until a colleague told me about it and requested I order a set for her senior English class. I try and read all the major novels and short stories taught by the teachers in my department, so I took a copy home to read over this term break.<br /><br />\\"The Curious Incident\\" was an inspiring read but also one that I was happy to reach the end of - both of these reactions on my part are a credit to Mark Haddon's story-telling and writing style.<br /><br />The story is told by the main character, Christopher Boone, \\"a fifteen year old boy from Swindon with Asperger's Syndrome who loves maths and his pet rat Toby\\" who also hates yellow and brown, being touched and people telling lies. We enter Christopher's story on a night when he discovers his neighbour's dog, Wellington, impaled with a fork in the backyard. Christopher sets out to solve the mystery of the dog's murder despite admonitions from his father to cease and desist.<br /><br />Haddon creates a brilliant narrative voice - the voice of a savant who awes readers with his observational skills and mathematical prowess; but also the voice of a boy who sounds younger than a teenager - a voice that speaks as many of my past eight year old students wrote, stringing series of sentences together starting with \\"And then\\" or \\"So then\\". It works.<br /><br />It works so well that, while I was admiring of the style, I also couldn't wait to break free from Christopher's thought processes. Surely Haddon intends to create this feeling in his readers - the feeling that you are trapped in Christopher's mind with him with all his pedantic obsessions and insistence on black and white reasoning. I found myself relating with his frustrated parents, imagining how difficult it must be for them, though they are certainly portrayed as flawed to say the least. It felt good to be released from this mind to think my own thoughts again, as mundane as they can be as well in comparison to some of the richness found in Christopher's scientific meanderings. As I say, it works. Of course, I also had that sense that, although I finish the book and move on with my life, Christopher and others like him, carry on.<br /><br />It's turned out to be a good recommendation and hopefully will be an excellent text for students with plenty to talk and write about. I look forward to their responses to it next term.<br /><br />(This review was originally published on Goodreads.com at: [...]<br /><br />Antony Millen is a Canadian living and writing in New Zealand.

B00DPY95D6|5.0|Picked up Chomi Prag's book on a whim and was surprised with it turned from a courtroom drama into a full fledged thriller. Didn't know exactly what to expect, but as an avid reader, I absolutely am thrilled to see up and coming authors putting their work out there. For fans of mystery, thrillers, and drama, this is definitely one of the better offerings I've seen. It really caught me off guard, especially the pacing and the attention to detail that was put on executing each twist and turn. It's definitely one of the better books I've read in recent months, and definitely will recommend it, check it out, and give it a chance, you too will be surprised by this one.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I like the game, but I wish the ads could be squelched. The game has one/two player options. One can hit the back or start button once the choice of names and other choices are made. The variable options of sound, rotating the board, moving against the clock or think time of 5/10/15/30 minutes choice could be designated for the time between each player's moves. The board has a clean and easy to view based on the design of it. I will hold onto the game despite the other reviews of hearing a check when it couldn't be possible or some other minor objecitons. The game will pan out for me or my option will be to seek another chess game by removing this one. I will at least give it a try as it's a free game, and I didn't really lose anything.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun but it needs more free levels. It really makes you think of different possibilities.  I can't wait for more challenges.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|I read the issues of freezing and people downloading it, and then having to remove it for different reasons. I give an app of this type time to see what it can do for finding those access points known as hot spots. I can follow the readings ok, but I too wish it had a free adds version available. Maybe that was going to be for this offering of an WiFi analyzer from this company. Test and use over time will tell, if this app is worth keeping on the Kindle Fire HD Tablet. I will give it a try, and I will keep searching for others to have a possible back up of the same type app available for my Kindle Fire HD. I think the multitude of resources like the guide books and manuals help one know what is true or works true to use.
086571701X|5.0|This book has step by step information to help you decide how you want to set up your system, and IF you want to.  It shows the pros and cons of each component, and gives a lot of information on how to prevent disasters.4<br /><br />Very well done, and very useful for someone considering an aquaponic system.
B000092HTE|5.0|Love this album and it arrived in fantastic condition.  One of those albums that you have to listen to from start to finish.  My personal favorite Eloy album.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I like this movie but I think the use of &#34;N&#34; word went way over the top. Considering this movie was a work of fiction by Tarrantino, I think he could have toned down the racist language. But, the action was a FIVE.
B001HOF8AA|4.0|Excellent sound, fantastic songs, Imelda May is glorious chocolate for my ears. Johnny Got a Boom Boom brought me here, I stayed for the rest of the goodness.
B005544TRQ|2.0|if you are not a lawyer or paralegal you MIGHT enjoy this but it is not likely. the premise that someone would get hired by a law firm without a law degree is pretty far fetched. the acting is overblown and the plots thin. not really worth the time.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I loved this book. This is my first time reading a Lee Child book and I have already bought book 2 and 3 in the series. Very suspenseful and it had twists that I did not see coming.
B001JIFYSA|3.0|I was hoping for a little more from this movie as it was pretty highly recommended to me. It's a good flick and worth the watch, but it's not ground breaking or life altering.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This was very suspenseful and kept me on the edge of my seat. I had to finish reading to the end so I could finally get my house clean!!
B0002G2B2M|5.0|I don't know if I'm supposed to rate the movie or the DVD itself. The DVD is indeed a DVD, silver colored, and has the movie 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' on it. It came packaged as one would expect, and is of good quality. The movie itself is BRILLIANT and I can't say much more than that. It's truly a wonderful place to hide for a couple hours, and leaves you thinking about your own choices in life.
B004YCKK6Y|5.0|the funny thing to me is reading the 1 star reviews? everything they hated about the film made it work for me. Quirky, funny, dark, sick and twistedly Tarantino.
0792844890|5.0|It's brilliant and funny. A true classic. The movie is wonderful, and this DVD was exactly as advertised- a DVD with Spaceballs on it. It's incredible.
1594202842|5.0|I actually loved this book. I'm a \\"western\\" mother of a 1 and 3 year old and I was raised playing the cello, but never seriously, although I stuck with it until college. I wasn't allowed to quit but I didn't put up a big fight, I accepted that this was the way it was. I have no regrets and respect my parents for making me stick with it. I love Chua's humor and ability to laugh at herself. I love that she involved her whole family in the writing of the book. I didn't take the \\"Chinese\\" or \\"Western\\" parenting as any affront on anyone, it's just an expression and I don't mind the over-simplification, it makes sense to me what she's trying to say. Mainly, this is a great memoir of a very unconventional approach to family life and parenting, lots to talk about with others, makes for a great debate. She just puts it out on the table in a readable, fast-paced book that I enjoyed from cover to cover.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I though it was really over-hyped as being some sort of blockbuster comedy which it's not, and maybe had I not been bombarded with promos on TV then I wouldn't have had such high expectations, but it was worth watching and pretty entertaining. Felt like it dragged on a bit long in some spots, but it's a pretty decent flick.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Funny game tho suck how you always have to buy stuff. Game pretty good other then that kids love it. Fun
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|One of the better super hero movies.  Marvel has been very clever, introducing us to all of the main characters ahead of time.  The actor playing The Hulk is the best of the actors who have played it in the original movies.  Josh Wheadon is an excellent director, under appreciated for his Serinity series, glad to see him take charge of this franchise.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, then I read the book.  I would recommend reading the books, they are even better than the movie.  I still really give the movie 2 thumbs up.
B00BB8OHMW|5.0|This movie is a classic.  Had not seen it in a long time.  Still a lot of fun to watch.
B0046B1KHG|3.0|This is a cute kid movie, some of the humor is for adults only.  This is not one of my favorites for sure.
B003DES8I6|5.0|Aequitas Veritas we need more of these kind of movies that shut down the bad guys<br />where have all the good guys gone? We need em to kick the bad guy's asses
B009PK9SB8|5.0|I have the Hero 3 Black, this is a great way to extend the battery life and helps me to better position the camera for recording in my truck and on my motorcycle as I do not have to use my cell phone app to see what the camera is seeing after I have it positioned, I can see what the camera is seeing while actively positioning it.
B00DFFHUUA|1.0|This is no doubt the worst GI Joe i have ever seen, movie or cartoon. The writers need to go into early retirement. It makes me wonder are they older than 18. The fighting scenes were not up to standard as the first,Snake eyes and storm shadow can never be in the same room without fighting and how do you kill of DUKE! He is GI Joe, any cartoon, or comic book has their leader and thats Duke. What was the purpose of pushing the movie back. I would have rather got the disappointment over last year. Hasbro should tear there contract up with the the writers and studio owners, and allow someone else to get it right.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|awesome!!! game. was great. for my 5 yr old too..had him using his. imagination!!! it had me wondering several times too...
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|Had this installed for a while then my phone started acting up when I would take pictures. I looked at my Lookout virus protection program today to find out this is a virus. DO NOT INSTALL OR EVEN DOWNLOAD!!!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love this app. mostly for percent of battery left and how long to charge. the battery changes color when it is getting low.  I use it several times a day.  love seeing how much battery I have for different uses
B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie was poorly marketed by Disney. When John Carter made it's initial run in the theatres I did not want to see it. Like most people I was not impressed by the trailers and marketing of this film. Upon recommendation from a friend I decided to watch this movie and was hooked ever since. I immediately bought my own copy of John Carter and have watched it five times in the week that I have owned it. Disney's marketing did not do this film justice and presented a much different film than what I and (judging from the reviews here) many others watched and loved. It did not help that critics bashed this film but, then again what do they know. Critics callously dissect films to the point that they lose the true essence of the film. This movie was fantasy, romance, sci-fi and adventure done right! I highly recommend it and hope Disney will come around and give us a much deserved sequel!
B002O2THRO|4.0|Much more realistic than the 2013 edition.  Bruce Dern did a great job playing Tom.  An overkill on the graphics with the 2013 one.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Give it a try.  You'll like it.  If not, you can delete it.  This ends the stupid required review to stop the pop up.
B005DNPKSQ|4.0|First time I watched this in the theater.  Very funny and fun ride.  The second time watching it wasn't quite as good but still pretty fun.  A must watch if you like Jim Carrey.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app forced crashed as soon as you click a video link...It's horrible will be un installing. Fix immediately please. Cannot even share or like the videos.

B005SEYOXW|5.0|A universe full of good guys/bad guys?  Nah, a universe full of gray guys, who reveal their vulnerabilities and their strengths.  A great series!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Really fun and interesting just not as challenging as I would like. Rooms don't change objects to find. But story line is awesome and fun. Still play it a lot.
1594746036|5.0|This is a fantastic story.  I was enthralled from the very beginning.  I can envision this being made into a movie.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|i LOVE THIS GAME, AND THE CHALLENGES YOU HAVE TO MEET.  I HAD FOR IT TO END.  i WANT IT TO GO ON FOREVER.
B00116GHMM|4.0|Just want to reiterate what others have mentioned about the weirdness of the vinyl version of this album. While I haven't listened to digital versions (and therefore can't make a comparison) this really does not sound like a mix correctly balanced for the medium. Granted, the band apparently wanted the album to sound &#34;gross&#34;, but I doubt they wanted it to sound *bad*. It's not just the &#34;compressed&#34; sound, which i think was intentional. It really does lack proper balance between highs and lows in a lot of places, and is overly distorted in spots that just don't seem to be fitting. That said, now that I'm used to it, I don't mind it so much. And the music is fun!
B008220DGE|4.0|The film is an intensely drama loosely based on the history of scientology. The film centers around Joaquin Pheonix's character as a WW2 veteran who is unsure of his future. He meets Phillip Seymore Hoffman's character who is the leader of \\"The Cause\\". What follows is a deep character perfectly executed by its director. The film may not be for everyone, but I think everyone has seen at least one Paul Thomas Anderson film to know his style and execution. Johnny Greenwood's score is immensely on point and the cinematography is stunning. The Master was crafted by a master filmmaker, and I know that was a cheesy way to describe it but it's worth experiencing.<br /><br />VIDEO: The film was shot mostly with 65mm film and the resulting picture detail and color is fantastic. The DVD transfer does a decent job representing the exact detail and grain as intended.<br /><br />AUDIO: The 5.1 mix here is great and gives the score a booming presence in the mix. As always though you're doing yourself a disfavor by seeing it on DVD. Go for the Blu-ray if that's available to you.<br /><br />EXTRAS: While there is a wealth of extras including lots of deleted scenes there isn't much about making the film. There's a feature-length documentary about WW2 veterans and it gives a nice background to the film, but it would have been nicer to see more than the 8-minute non-structured Behind The Scenes featurette they have.
B00BGQ2OYC|3.0|I feel like this is one of those albums that will get attention because of the one or two songs that get air time, and will eventually join the pile of oh-yeah-that-was-popular-once. A fad. I like it, but it just doesn't blow me away. Like, not one song. Even Entertainment after a few runs feels overplayed. Don't bankrupt your music budget with Bankrupt. On the other hand, if you're really a fan, go for it. The vinyl version is a nice pressing, and if I really liked their style, I'd probably be much more enthused.
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I think the strongest aspects of this book are the character and relationship developments.  The hero is extremely alpha (whoohoo!!) and the heroine, while beaten down, is still a strong character. Their relationship is beautifully written by Ms. Singh.  I loved this and the fact that we didn't get too bogged down in all of the politics and other characters from previous books that were my issues with the last two books.  The only reason I detracted .5 stars is because I felt there was a bit too much angst and melodrama that could have been tightened up into a more cohesive story.  Otherwise, a very enjoyable stand alone book (no cliffhangers! YAY) that can be read without having read all of the others in the series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son and daughters love this game. It is one of the best games that I've seen In a long time!
B0095P33IW|3.0|The story was more interesting at the start. The second half of movie is mostly good battling evil, a bit tiresome.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I read his other two books, and I just love the way he writes.  He's almost artistic with his words.  I recommended it for<br />my book club !
B002GHIPYI|5.0|I bought these for my husband because he likes to watch  LOUD action movies on his computer right on the other side of my bedroom wall.  He is picky, so I read a bunch of reviews and picked these.  He is happy with them, they are comfortable and he can hear everything he wants to hear.  We are both happy, he can watch his movies and I can SLEEP undisturbed.
1439170916|5.0|My purposes for reading The Emperor of All Maladies might be a little different than others. As a scientist starting out in the field of cancer biology, I wanted to get a &#34;soft landing&#34;, and Emperor perfectly established a mindset to start thinking about this disease. It sets up a context for the field in terms of what has been done in the past.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I've been a King fan from the beginning and his stories never disappoint me, the only problem is this one was not long enough for me, I always want more
B000RLHDUM|5.0|Amazon recommended The Thomas Crown Affair because I had rented Ocean’s 11.  If you are looking for an entertaining movie with a little action, a little romance, and a few good plot twists, this is a great choice.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|1. Download and install an app on the Amazon market called File Expert.  2. Go to setting on your Kindle Fire.  3. Choose “Device” option.  4. Choose “On” option for “Allow Installation of Applications” from unknown sources.    5. Now download the Candy Crush Saga app file onto your computer: [...]  6. Plug in your Fire, and copy the Candy Crush Saga file into your Fire.  7. Go to File Expert and locate the installation (.apk) file and hit install!    Works amazingly better than the beta version from my computer which I've had to use since I can't download it to my phone
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This was a good read. The story started out with the basics of the young man's life let you know who he was and what his station in life was then built from there I liked it. And it told the story from the aspect of the people from that period.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book! I would defiantly recommended this book to anyone! I can't wait to the third book!!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is fun and it has many fun obsticals for everybody and for many othrler ages
B009LQKHIO|3.0|The author was gracious enough to share her book with me I and must say I am looking forward to the next one in the series. A heartbreaking and yet beautiful story that shows you that there are second chances in life. It was an easy read. I did however feel that the female main character did overcome her previous abuse very fast, but I also know that it would not have been possible to drag the story out too long. Inevitably we all want to get to the part where we sigh and say, there is still hope out there, even for people who have had to endure so much heartache in their lives
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minions is just like subway surfers.The minions is a great game to play.Play this game and you will be amazed.

B00127RAJY|5.0|this workout dvd is fantastic!  i am a man and i found all of the workouts challenging and fulfilling(even using the lighter dumbbells!)  this dvd is a vast improvement over the p90x videos which are dark, way too long, and too basic/repetitive.  i actually gave the p90 discs i had away to a friend.  even though i do like the trainer tony.  i like jillian's assistants in this video also.  they are always in sync with her and know what to do.  i thought the assistants in p90x were a little unfamiliar with what tony was doing at times and looked to be struggling too much.  anyways, this is the best workout dvd i have had out of about 7 or 8 that i've had and is a must keep and use!

B00B6KJ0AE|4.0|Wow!!! Way to rebound from your last release this is their best release in many years. Having been a fan since &#34;Painkiller/Pay It in Metal&#34; way back in '78, I have hoped that they would rebound and return to their glory days. This CD ranks right up there with some of their best. It would fit neatly inbetween say &#34;Headhunter, The Blitz, and Change of Address. Pick it up it's priced right and it sounds great blasting out of the CD player.
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|Very fun and addicting its just I thought you were put in a random generated word were you walk yourself or else I would have rated it 5 but still fun
B00CXX8KTA|3.0|Way to many of these songs sound like they have been lifted from the back catalog of one of the greatest bands in the history of R N' R. Yes it is okay but with the musicians on this disc I expected a far superior collection of tracks. If you like classic blues rock and want to support the musicians on this CD then by all means buy this disc. I guess I just expected more from a band that tours as &#34;Thin Lizzy&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my 3 year old daughter and my 9 year old nephew both love it and me too! Its great we love the minions!
B001GCUO1Q|2.0|X-Men Origins Wolverine continues the downfall of the X-Men franchise.  The franchise had already taken a big dive because of X-Men the Last Stand, and this film did not help matters any.  Admittedly, I did enjoy this movie when I first saw it in the theaters.  However, the more I thought about and the more reviews I saw of it, my opinion changed on the film.  I can still watch it as a time waster but that is about it.  If I had to pick between this and X-Men 3 I like this a little more but they are both pretty bad.<br /><br />Obviously this film is goes into Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) origins that the fans have been hoping to see for a while since X2.  We get to see him in the Weapon X program and how he lost his memory.  However, they did such a half-assed job that it would have been better if his origins had been left a mystery.  We got quite a bit of his origin in X-Men 2.  To me that is all that we really needed to know.  This movie to me is very much like the Star Wars Prequels (minus episode 3).  When I finally got to see Anakin's origin and the old republic, I thought that it should have remained a mystery.  To me the prequels kind of make me like the original films a bit less now.  I have the same feeling with Wolverine.<br /><br />First of all why he joined the Weapon X project is lame and uninteresting.  At the start of the film he joined a team with his brother, Sabertooth, and other mutants like Deadpool, the Blob, etc.  However he quits and moves back to Canada.  Later Sabertooth murders his woman, and Wolverine wants revenge.  He goes to striker to be a part of the Weapon X program.  Wolverine's reason for joining Weapon X is due to some flimsy revenge motive that we've seen a million times.<br /><br />I did not find Wolverine and Sabertooth's rivalry to be that engaging at all.  Plus Sabertooth as a character is both uninteresting and inconsistent.  In this movie Sabertooth is Wolverine's brother, but we never got any indication of that in the othermovies.  Sabertooth seemed like he never knew  Wolverine in the first X-Men film.  This Sabertooth is quite intelligent, while the one in the first X-Men seemed very stupid and was just there to be the muscle.  In both movies I do not find Sabertooth to be an interesting character.<br /><br />Also they have to through in random mutants into the film for no purpose.  The majority of these mutants are in the film just to be in the film.  Cyclops and Professor X make a cameo which does not amount to much.  Gambit also makes a cameo.  He is basically there because he had not been put into a movie yet until then.  These mutants take away precious time that could have been used to further develop Wolverine.  This should have been Wolverine's film with very few other mutants involved.<br /><br />The worst thing though is what they did to Deadpool.  Deadpool is one mutant that I actually do not mind being in the film because he, like Wolverine, was in Weapon X.  In the comics Deadpool was involved in the Weapon X program and had regenerative abilities like Wolverine.  He is also supposed to be like Spiderman in that he cracks a lot of one-liners.  He is supposed to be very witty.  However, the filmmakers decided to ignore all of that and turn him into a videogame boss.  In this he not only has regenerative abilities but the powers of many other mutants' powers.  Plus is mouth is sealed shut, which takes away a major aspect of his character.  Needless to say Deadpool fans were not happy about these changes to the character to say the least.<br /><br />The action scenes are okay but I have seen better in the other movies including the Last Stand.  The effects are good in some places, but in other places they looked off.  The effects in the other X-Men movies, again including the Last Stand, are much better which is sad because those movies were made years before this.<br /><br />Overall I do not recommend this movie.  This movie could have easily been great but they just dropped the ball.  Hopefully the new Wolverine is actually good.  It looks like they are actually focusing on Wolverine and not incorporating many random mutants which is a good sign.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I have a Kindle fire and have had this app on my other tablets as well, it let me down load the songs but when I checked all of my songs were 0:00, and if I tried to fast forward I would go back to the start of the song, but the videos I downloaded were fine.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love it ots fun cool and frustrating  qll at the same time but o lpve my hprse and o will take care of it
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This is an excellent book.  The complaint that nothing happens ignores significant developments, and tremendous character maturation here.  The writing is good.  The sometimes irritating tics such as \\"much and more\\" are there to provide atmosphere and they do it.  If you like this series, you'll like this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is awesome lots of tools and missions. best game ever I &lt;3 this game you should get it
0802473156|5.0|As a commit-o-phobe, I wanted to be sure that my relationship with my fiance was going to last for eternity. I decided to read a few books to better understand how to make that happen. I tried other books but this was by far my favorite. It does feel like common sense when you read it but only after you read it. I never would have come up with the analogies, examples, or ways of explanation when trying to express to my fiance what I needed to feel sure we were doing the right thing. So far, I feel that it is really helping our relationship. At the authors request, we have made lists of a few things we can do to make the other feel loved and it's working! Obviously, making your spouse feel loved is occasionally doing things you normally wouldn't but it's worth it to have a healthy, long-lasting relationship.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|We can't get enough of this game.  As you advance the levels definately get harder, I love the challenge!  This is a must have game.

B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|This CD is a must have. I've had it on repeat since I purchased it. J. Cole has yet to disappoint.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I like and love it. My children liked and loved it too. Thanks for putting this on Kindle Fire. Thank you very much.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|What a great account of the First World War, told through the eyes of a cast of memorable characters . This, combined with the sequel, Winter of the World that features a continuation of the characters and their children, form a panoramic history of Europe in the first half of the century. The effect is similar to Winds of War and War and Remembrance by Herman Wouk. These are great, outstanding pieces of historical fiction and rank with the best books I've ever read, and I read on average, a book a week. I can't wait for the third book in the trilogy.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|The Sigma Force again intrugues with brains in addition to their combat skills and good fortune. Mr. Rollins continues to provide believable science with travel to distance locations (and worlds, for that matter).  For Rollins fans, and tohers, you won;t be disappointed.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Worked as carry on and was convenient and light enough to use as the daily camera bag on a trip to Colorado.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I get these games for my child, not for me.  So my rating is really his rating.  He played this game for 5-10 minutes 3-4 days in a row.  Essentially he said (in toddler speak) that he didn't get the point of the game.  That's not a good review of any game but especially not one that features Disney characters.<br /><br />I do not recommend this game for anyone.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Had to reread this to wash the stink of the film away! Amazing book and every bit as good the 2nd time. The movie not so much...
B008B68IUY|4.0|OK, for any monster high fan, this is a cool car. The seat belts, steering wheel, etc. work good.  It is a pretty cool car and lots of fun.  I have found that the monster high stuff is expensive (because they can charge it and get it) and that the toys other than dolls aren't always made the best.  Maybe it is just production of toys in general is going down hill.  Either way, this toy is OK qualitly, and a ton of fun.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A wonderful story of triumph of the spirit.  I found myself thinking about this book during the day while I was working, truly looking forward to the evening so I could be with Jamie as he fought through his past'  I really hope we hear more of these characters from this author.
B009AMAGQM|1.0|Yes, I read the books first. I HATED this movie. I wanted to take it back immediately. The story-line was way off. If I had not read the books, I would have been confused in quite a few parts. \\"Why is this happening\\" \\"What is going on with that?\\" They left out so many key parts. And yea, some people think you shouldnt go in expecting the movie to be exactly like the book, which I did not...But come on...EVERYTHING was different. Even the fact that they had Amma play the Seer AND the Keeper...Did they really not have enough money to have someone play Marian? How can a Seer be a Keeper? And the movie did not show how strong Lena and Ethans connection really was. I did not like the ending they tried to pull, with Ethan not remembering her pretty much at all. It was just terrible. The Twilight series didnt even have this many changes. Oh and the acting in this movie..horrible. Maybe if they make another one, they will get better in time, but I doubt I will attempt to watch anymore of these. Ill stick to the books.
B0019N95IK|3.0|I love Star Trek Enterprise!  It may be my favorite Trek series next to TOS but sadly Paramount allowed a very lack luster HD conversion of season one.  Maybe this release is the best they could put together but I wanted WOW and I only got &#34;meh.&#34;  So if you are fortunate enough to own all 4 seasons of Enterprise in standard def be content because that's as good as it gets for now.  If you don't and are a blu-ray collector wait and buy them when they come out as a 4 season set.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|even my 15 year old loves this. He is a Lego collector and a Stars Wars fan, so this was perfect.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Nothing too much to say. Christmas music is nice and if you like Rod Stewart you will like these songs.
B002QCD2OG|3.0|Saw the remake with Nicolas Cage. Entertaining to see both films in context of the time their making. Added to the entertainment factor.
1250027624|5.0|Julian Fellows explains how his own relatives and the books he read about the era influenced his story \\"Downton Abbey\\".<br /><br />Photos and illustrations give glimpses into the daily routine and a look at transportation, advertising, and writings in journals. A portion of the book follows the daily timeline so you can see what it would be like to step into the shoes of workers. Find out how much you do for yourself that you would not do if you lived in that era on an estate.<br /><br />This book is  more detailed then The World of Downton Abbey. So if you have been following the TV show this will be a very satisfying supplement. Fellows explains the motivations for many of the actions of the characters. This insight will contribute to your enjoyment of the scenes.
B00C5ZNUCS|5.0|Absolutely amazing. Ghost (a true fan does not say Ghost BC) delivers are stellar sequel with infestissumam. the use of latin, a choir, and overall heavier tunes makes this even better than Opus, though that album rocked too.
B00CFQMVLS|4.0|a action filled Bruce Willis movie from start to finish. Only thing I didn't like was the subtitles in Russian. Can't read that fast. Thank goodness wasn't in the complete movie or I would be very upset.
1568363931|4.0|I bought this book mainly for inspiration. I'm a beginner at bento lunches and cooking in general and will realistically, probably never make most of these recipes. However, the pictures are beautiful and this is a good cookbook to add to my collection.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|My girls are too young to wear makeup themselves so they love being able to play like this. For them it's the next best thing!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|very nice the best musical very fast fun to watch and sing along<br />no problems recived the packadge fast and easy
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Sandra Bullock is so good in this film I didn't realize it was her through most of the movie! Wonderful story, because it is based on reality. A must even for non-sports fans.
B005AKFXZW|4.0|Its full of description and you can easily imagine walking around this  circus,with likable characters and  a teasing little plot. Good bit of escapism.
B005NFVZTM|1.0|Lame movie. By far. The music, the acting, the terrible costume for beast. They should've left this alone. Not a recommendation if you're looking for a good movie.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much! We decided to read this in our book club and though I got off to a slow start I have really enjoyed the journey. I would recommend it to other readers for sure!
0143038095|4.0|Slightly worn. It's a very fun read, though. Once a classic, always a classic. I think I like reading the chinese translation better.
B000002KB8|5.0|Five mind blowing stars and obviously one of the greatest metal/rock albums ever created. As I've said in other reviews you can not go wrong with any Sabbath with Ozzy, the first six being the best. Now if you have not bought &#34;13&#34; yet go get it immediately!!!
B001ANSS5K|4.0|How do I rate this? It's on my kindle. It's a very fun read, though. This is by far my favorite John Green's book.
B000002KET|5.0|Again, in my mind the first six Sabbath albums are all five stars so it's hard for me to say one stands out from the others. That said, I can say that this has the most powerful Sabbath song ever written is on here in Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. That brings the best riff and best Ozzy vocals ever in an absolute brutally heavy masterpiece which could possibly even be the best metal song of all time by any band. This was 1973!!! Other standouts include Sabbra Cadabra, Spiral Architect and Killing Yourself To Live. Fluff is a cool instrumental that may grow on you the more you hear it. This is just about the pinnacle of Ozzy's voice here so sit back and soak in the greatness!
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|It just gets better with Season 2.  Sumptuous sets and costuming, wonderful cinematography (oftentimes posed/composed as a 15th century painting), excellent acting, a compelling story line (yes, trumped up for drama from the historical facts, but this is television, after all), and likeable characters (including the villains), all make for a very watchable season.
B000002H6C|5.0|Rock solid release that saw Metallica vault into the mainstream. This was my first Metallica album and I will always love it for that. Yes, the songs are long intricate and a bit repetitive. It sounds a little thin but this is the sound that they (Lars) were going for at the time. I seem to listen to this one less but it still stands strong in the Metallica cannon. One is incredible and To Live Is To Die also a masterpiece. This is a very angry album and many fans like it for that reason. The Black album would see the first major change in direction.  Vinyl review: steer clear of the 2lp new vinyl. The volume is mastered so low you won't be happy. At first I talked myself into the fact that it was acceptable. It is not and I am seeking out an original pressing. I have not heard the 4LP 45RPM set which does get excellent reviews. Pretty much two choices, original pressing or the 45RPM. Choose wisely.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I've been reading and re-reading these stories for over a decade.  The characters stay with you.  You will not be disappointed if you enjoy historical fiction with a fantastic love story mixed in.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|The content of the program is good. The quality of the service from Amazon is always a problem.  Sometimes it takes many nights to see one show because there are so many interruptions in service. I don't have those same problems with Netflix.
1616550414|5.0|Gift for my friend. He is a Zelda fanatic like I am, and when he opened this he freaked. The hug cracked a few bones. =) amazing artwork inside. BUY THIS!! IT IS SO WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!
B006XBSAP2|3.0|Music is good. The package arrived in a timely manner. Only thing I was disappointed with was the crack in the case, but it's only a case right? The disc is clean of any scratches!!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Not a teenager movie, but middle age or older.  Some the scenes were cute. Thought Barbara did a good job as well as her son. They went together nicely.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This is the worst game I ever got in my life I have kindle fire. It made my kindle frozen. I tried to restart my kindle, but that did not even work. I had to restart it about ten times. I'm sure that it works for android phones and I'm sure that it fun and all, but it for sure does not work for a kindle fire! I would give it zero stars if I could.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Well I think it is good good good I think but I like it well it's fast and it is easy to use if you r use to it
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I absolutely love this product, and am very enjoyed to have such a mouse. The weights, the design, and functionality of the mouse are outstanding. I plan on buying more gaming products from this company more!
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|Thought the book was great my parents talked about it and I just had to see what they were talking about.. Very good! Rock chalk
B008JFUR10|5.0|Awesome summer blockbuster.  I was/am a huge fan of the classic Toho monster movies.  This was better!  Great action, fun characters, cute romance.  Draws heavily from anime and giant monster movie tropes, all in good ways.  I cannot conceive of how this movie isn't doing better.  GO SEE IT!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a great read to learn about Seal Team Six and the mission to get Osama Bin Laden.  I had seen the 60 Minutes interview and that intrigued me to get the book.  Realistic account that reflects the benefit of training for anything in life.  One learns how to react to surprises and other routes to success.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Title says it all. If you are a devout religious person and easily get offended this book is not for you. Robert Langdon is the Character, Dan Brown-  I wouldn't expect a whole new experience. But it's good... Just as the others.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This weather app works great and is what I was looking for in a weather app. Just what the doctor ordered.
B004LPLU4K|5.0|I love this book.  This version did take some liberties with the book but nonetheless was very enjoyable.  I wonder how many grouchy ladies Maggie Smith has played in her lifetime.
B001E9641K|5.0|I was surprised how enjoyable I found this game. The only real downside is that it cannot accommodate any more than three players and it looses some of it's charm with two players. The result is a great game if you have a trio, but that's often a hard number to come up with.
0307730700|5.0|This guys is one of the toughest guys in history.  Also a great father and husband.  Every American should read this book.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|i ordered this as a gift. it was a good price and it got there earlier than expected and she's very happy with it. good purchase...
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I was expecting a little more in staying true to the Frank L Baum story line and not so much fiction.  According to this story, when he meets Dorothy Gale of Kansas in the Wizard of Oz he should have known her right away...<br /><br />The flying monkeys in the original were scary - the flying baboons - ridiculous.<br /><br />It was just too over the top.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Nice game to play. Wish when it starts up it would default sound off instead of default sound on then you have to select sound off. But all in all for a free game it is fun.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have Apple products and Android products.  This will sync your PC to all of them.  Great for taking notes looking at them later.  This app is likely one that I use more than others.  It beats paying for Microsoft's stuff.  It might even be better than their stuff.
B0041D843M|5.0|All the facts are there.  You have everything to gain by reading this book.  I wish I had read it sooner.  This book can change your life for the good!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is easy to share Scriptures on Twitter and Facebook.  Plus you can look at the different translations quickly.  It also has great reading plans.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Loved the original and 3 stared all the levels so this was the next step. Fun and easy to get into with increasing difficulty. Good game makes you think and problem solve.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Somewhat slow to start, but very very good once it gets going. The book is well written and easy to read. It does a very good job of explaining the events that occurred from a very new perspective, that of the Germans'; while at the same time jumping back to the Americans' perspective. It is easy to lump all Germans into one category, Nazis, but that simply isn't the historically accurate perspective and this book reminds you of that. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in history, aviation, or even just a very good story.<br /><br />Points of criticism would include the following. The book focuses heavily on Franz and could have talk about Charlie's story in more detail. Also, there are some sections, especially when talking about Franz's initial few missions, that lacked detail. For instance, when telling of Franz's first dogfight the detail is very lacking. As the book progresses, however, the author does a better job of providing plenty of detail. All in all, this was a good book regardless.
B005EHQGTS|4.0|my secondary desktop is setup as a dev machine and with the keyboard on my tablet, I can even write code with it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This was a very easy fun loving game to play.  I liked the idea of playing various modes of the game (i.e.  &#34;Arcade&#34; and &#34;Classic&#34;).  Also loved the sound effects of the game.  Still trying to understand a few elements of the game (i.e why are there times I get a star, and how are the points derived with a star).  I guess I will figure that out over time.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I kinda liked the first book so I had to read the trilogy.  This book kept me interested, wondering where the story would go.  Overall, it was a disappointment
B0067R0APK|2.0|But not the best either.  I thought that after the latest update the RADAR map would function properly, but I guess I thought wrong.
B009LDCXNY|4.0|I love Supernatural & I always will. I have been a fan since day 1, but I have to say that I do miss when they were hunting ghosts & monsters. I enjoyed this show a lot more before they started getting so deep into the demon/angel thing. Sometimes it seems like a totally different show than when it started. I really hate to say it, but I'm starting to get bored with it. I will continue watching this show until it ends because I love Sam & Dean, but I do really miss the \\"good old days\\". I wish they could somehow get away from all the angel/demon stuff & go back to hunting ghosts/monsters. It was much more exciting to watch.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love this app!! Becomes more and more addicting as each level is reached.<br />This really makes you think for ways to solve the problems and makes you use your memory
B000ERU9S2|5.0|Besides great acting, it had a fabulous car chase scene that was done at speed. Great plot, great supporting cast.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|So far it has taken me almost half a hour to download the program. Don't get the program if you want to play it instantly.
030758836X|2.0|A decent summer read, in that it keeps you guessing and turning pages...though sections felt needlessly drawn out. I felt that it took forever to get to the plot twist (1/3 of the way through) that finally gets the story going. But here was my big problem: Here and there, especially w/ regard to Nick's dad, the language the writer uses to describe older adults/senior citizens is cruel and downright ageist. Yes, the observations are coming from the characters, but the writer doesn't give context; the ageism is taken for granted. The ageist prose on display in this book (in just a few passages) reminds me of the culture-permeating racism that casually affects (and, today, diminishes) the work of writers such as Margaret Mitchell and Edna Ferber. In 20-30 years, readers will come across these passages and be appalled.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|Very bland metal mixed with super fast soloing and very little prog. I'm heavily disappointed with Jordan Rudess' work on this album. The sounds are annoying and he's just playing really fast with no melodic afterthought. This album is too mechanical and not particularly good in the melodic department. Most of the songs feel lifeless. The songs are fast, yea, but only rarely does speed denote satisfaction here. In the Name of God is easily the best song on the album.
B000W1V5VU|5.0|What a great way to pass my convalescence! I've been laid up with a bad Achilles tendon.  Watched the Ocean's trilogy,  Glad I was able to have all three.
B001KZG99A|4.0|Good story....the ending foreshadows another....Miss Potts was rather a bland character. Great to see Robert Downey Jr. soar as a Phoenix.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|As a legit admirer of J. Cole I was not disappointed at all with this purchase. This album clearly shows his growth from 'The Come Up' to 'Born Sinner' but also his keen ability to cater to the needs of his listeners while still having a meaningful message.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this app. It's a good fun challenge. It's much better than other escape games. I'm already addicted to this game :)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I waited for this book to com out. Could not put down. Loved it! Can't wait to see what happens next!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game it is very fun but it comes with a challenge and you can use Facebook or you don't have to
B004LROUW2|3.0|Long read. Interesting end after complex journey of characters and riddles. Requires longer reflection to determine value and/or satisfaction. Long read . . . . Oh um. It's only a paper moon.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game ,mainly because I love the movie. I highly recommend this game for everyone it is like my so many of my other favorite games. It is so much fun!
B005EHQGTS|1.0|Downloaded and installed this free offering but it isn't functional?<br />What's up with that? Have downloaded, installed, repaired, removed and re-installed Splashtop Streamer on XP sp3 but it does nothing???<br /><br />Update! Does Not Support Nexus 4
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Loving the game it's realistic and addictive.you are able to groom,ride,compete at events,clean the paddock,buy more horse everything u can imagine to owning it own horse.<br />The graphics in the game are amazing.
B0094J5DSC|5.0|Granddaughter asked for it for her birthday and has been playing with it for almost a month!  Lego did it again!  Great toy.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|It's a really cool app but.......I'm terrible at this game. I just thought I would throw that out there. ;)
B00BI745AA|5.0|A wonderful version of a compelling story.  Worth your time.  A terrific cast...perhaps not the best voices i have ever heard.
B008M721MS|3.0|So I downloaded this app on my kindle. (Before you start to think I'm stupid I just wanna say, yes, my kindle does have a camera) and I created an account and tried to Skype with my friend. She could only see herself, she couldn't see me and I couldn't see me or her. And I turned the video thing on and nothing changed.<br /><br />#wat_da_heck??
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I love the &#34;buddy&#34; shows: like Life, Castle, Mentalist, etc. I personally think this is the best of them, and season 3 does not disappoint. While the sexual tension between Castle and Beckett is clear, and intensifies in season 3, they never cross the line, so that the interplay never gets banal. Well worth a watch!
B00AEBBA68|4.0|If It Would Be Less Cheaper, It Would Be Perfect! Love The Movie. Disc Comes With Some Extra Features In High Quality. Would Recommend It To Everybody!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Do you know why is awesome because it can be. I like it better than BTD 3 and I love that that game
B000PC0U1W|5.0|What Can Be Better Than Buying A Great Movie For Less Price? I Really Love It! Would Recommend It To Everyone.
0385040253|5.0|This book is the ultimate book of knots. No need to buy let alone look at other books of knots. now to find time to learn the craft&#34;
0793563836|4.0|Came in looking new and fresh. don't aspect any tablature  from this book, but it's still awesome. Little pricey though...
0385738773|5.0|My teenage boys really have enjoyed this entire series, and I think it is very creative myself. Job well done!
B00AEDDSTI|5.0|This book sucks you in and consumes you. Its a wild adventure. When you put it down, it takes at least ten minutes to shift back into the real world. Its so good, it added several items to my bucket list.<br /><br />This should be at the top of your reading list.
B00B4W4UAY|4.0|It's hard for me to not like this album.  Laurie Wisefield (brilliant guitar work), Moody, etc...  Great guitar work and tones.  Definitely some fun driving rock, 70's style!  I think they can do better.  The songs are very good, but I think the production could be better and more dynamic.  Hopefully, they'll record another and take the whole thing up a notch.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Please, if you haven't read this one just imagine the ending you want and go with that. Imagine one in which Katniss has learned from her mistakes. Where she has grown as a person and a friend. Where she has learned what Snow is made of enough to recognize instantly when something is not his work. Where she does more than fumble around, get hurt and wake up in hospital. Again. And again. And in the climax... yep. Again. Clearly Suzanne Collins was \\"hijacked\\" when she wrote this because the person who developed the amazing players and the intricate beginnings of this story could not possibly have ended it in an uninteresting way that left me not caring about what happened to a single character. I didn't care if Katniss ended up with Gale or Peeta. It flat out did not matter. And really if this was the way it happened, none of them would have cared either. Where are the twists and turns that carried us through the first books? There was one brilliant twist in the whole book. All the others were lurching, slowly grinding turns. My complaint isn't with the way the plot went, only that it didn't bring me along with it.
B000FC1HBY|2.0|This book is frustrating because there is no on  to root for and in fact it seems the author purposefully favors those you want to root against the most. Also the battle scenes are incoherent and feel contrived because there is always some last-minute hand of God type incident that just turns the battle in a certain direction that has little to do with logic.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|It was very good until all my tack got deleted and ads started popping up EVERYWHERE! It can get boring but it is still a good game.
1781162646|3.0|this was certainly not king's best.  aside from that, i could do without the unsolicited politicl commentary. it seems to be an afflication o american artists.
1576754227|5.0|Eat That Frog was suggested reading in a Project Management Seminar that I attended.  I loved the name of the book so had to get a copy and read it. Since then I have recommended this book to everyone I know.  I would recommend this book for professionals and anyone else wanting to improve their productivity at work or home.  Brian Tracy has made decluttering my desk easy and he has put fun back into my life.  So don't procrastinate any longer \\"Eat That Frog! and buy this book you'll be glad that you did.
1554072840|5.0|Prudence helped both of my girls learn to use the potty. It was the only book that really worked. There are clear pictures, they aren't graphic, just clear of what needs to happen.
B00932A4XE|5.0|If you have ever had a baby you could totally relate to this movie.  I laughed so hard, it was one of the best comedy's  I have seen in quite a while.
072325804X|5.0|I absolutely love these stories. Its a big book but comes in a cardboard case to protect it on the shelf. My girls know it is special and love to have me read from it. The word to picture ratio is perfect for toddlers.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read all the Sookie Stackhouse books and I was hoping for an ending. I wasn't disappointed with the ending. I enjoyed this book very much. Glad that the series has ended with this ending.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|... then this program will do you well enough. However, those new to the game may find themselves in fits attempting to understand the complexity of this game. Be aware of the monumental task before you should you decide to do so.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book made me cry throughout the whole book. It is such a touching book. It taught me so much. It is a must read.
B001EC0OMM|4.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely. The characters were simple and charming, the storyline was interesting considering the period of time, and the outcome was only slightly predictable.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|EVIL DEAD, in a nutshell, amounts to a gore-filled romp in and around the ubiquitous cabin in the woods.  If you take pleasure in witnessing the atrocities of mutilation, then this film should be right up your alley.  There's plenty of it; and once it starts, it doesn't let go.  Based on the makeup and FX aspects alone, I would give this movie 2.5 stars.  It's good enough to make even the most cynical gorehounds and make-up/visual effects artists take pause.  Realistic, disturbing and cringe-worthy, this stuff is.  And as it's applied here, to humans possessed by evil forces, it's more forgiving and endurable than that which is presented in torture porn of recent.  But it possesses one star more than that, namely due to some slick directing and amazingly apt photography which gives the movie a much more sinister and foreboding atmosphere than its sparse and gritty, albeit adorable predecessor (THE EVIL DEAD, 1981).  EVIL DEAD is very well crafted, but ultimately limited to 3.5 stars because such a disproportionate amount of its value stems from makeup and FX of a particularly gruesome variety.  What is does, it does extremely well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|get it. it is great for iphones or kindle fires.  good for waiting in a doctors office or downloads.  great app. ive had it for over a year and I still enjoy it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is great I love it I ride and this is just like the real thing. and it always gets better!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The writers for this show are awesome! Likable and interesting characters.<br />Marathon tv sessions in store for me because of this show!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have enjoyed watching this from the first season and am looking forward to next season.  It's so interesting to get an idea of how they lived at that time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is really fun. love it. one problem is that it sometimes freezes and also it takes away my tokens. #not cool
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Not near as good as the first two Robert Langdon novels. I absolutely love Angels & Demons, so I had high hopes for this book and was super excited to read it, but sadly disappointed. Not terrible, but not great.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Have always heard about this book but never took the time to read it. I always like to read books before seeing the movies. I may have enjoyed this a little more if I were 10 years younger. A good read for high schoolers and kids trying to find themselves.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|***spoilers ahead***<br /><br />I don't know what happened, I bought this book when it first came out and LOVED it, I re-read it because I felt like something a bit raunchy and good. But for some reason I just couldn't get into it.<br /><br />The writing became a bit sloppy, first we're in the past, then the future then the present, or was that the future? There were so many flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks that I found myself unsettled. I just couldn't really get into it as there was no flow. And the messages/emails that go on for pages and pages really brought me out of the story and I found myself skipping over them.<br /><br />Hell, I found myself skipping over the sex scenes as the \\"sauntering\\"s and \\"oh my's\\" mixed in with the F-bombs realyl got my hackles up. It;s the same sex scene in different locations. If you're having sex THAT MUCH, you'd be better at it, and less awed by your partners knowledge.<br /><br />The characters were not consistent. Sometimes Ana calls her father stepdad, then Ray, then Dad, then Daddy, then stepdad. If he was as close to her as she says- he would be plain old DAD. Even Christian does this \\"Ray\\" \\"your stepfather\\" \\"your dad\\" ARG!<br /><br />When they are on the boat on their honeymoon, Christian states it blelongs to \\"sir somebody or rather\\" there is NO WAY that he would let Ana on a boat and not know it's full history. This in my opinion was a huge slip up of his character.<br /><br />All in All, I found this book an overly romantacised abusive relationship. Ana never wants to upset him and is always asking forgiveness, and then they have sex to make it all better. It really left a bad taste in my mouth and felt like they never really just got along. Perhaps a few years ago when I first read this it was exciting, like the 'bad boy' or something, but now I read about Christian and think, DUMP HIM ANA! really! you don't need to keep admonishing yourself for speaking your mind!I mean really, she starts sucking her thumb,which is a sure sign of needing security and reassurance. And she even, at one point, states that she was relieved that he was staying away beacuse he thought he would hurt her as she thought it was because he didn't want her! The idea of him not wanting her was LESS APPEALING than being abused. Good god!<br /><br />I found the writer went through 'word of the day' type syndrome. suddenly everything is \\"yar\\" and then rather than I love him, it was \\"I love (name) so.\\" Suddenly parents became 'folks.' Just sloppy I think.<br /><br />I wanted to like this so so so so so SOOOooooo much! But I couldn't get past the annoyance of how bad their relationship is.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Works like magic!! I have been searching for this game (which is my favorite!) and the cool thing is u get to choose ur own themes, also u could use ur own photos; downloaded or taken! Couldnt ask for a better app! =P Have fun playing with it! =]
B002QE3CTY|3.0|The beginning  was long and it seemed like The Maze Runner took forever to get up  and running. Once it did, however, you are sucked into the little world of the Gladers. I asked myself, would a regulated, safe, stable, world be worth giving up free choice. How would I feel to live a boring and routine life if it ment I was safe. I look forward to reading the sequel. Hoping that it won't take half the book to get into the meat of the story.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Childs always keeps you guessing, always seems to have the right twist to keep you going, reminds me a lot of the old Mickey Spillane books of days gone by.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I really enjoyed this 2nd book in the trilogy and can't wait for the third one.  I love the way he weaves real events in history into the plot line.  These are books that I will go back and read again some day.
B00BV1P8NG|5.0|It's very cute, a bit taller than I expected, but in great shape! Love the bubbles, nice shade of and a nice shade of grey.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|I love this music. I never realized how many songs Calvin Harris wrote. I listen to it while I'm working out. It keeps me moving!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Excellent show, if you watch it you won't regret it. Good actors, cool story line, funny lines, over all one of my favorite tv shows
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I enjoy and have read nearly every novel Grisham has written. The Racketeer will make you laugh and sit in awe of its ingenuity. I truly was unable to put it down.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I searched around for a great camera bag, this one at an extremely reasonable price was everything i wanted and more.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The character who had the fortitude to stand up for the &#34;right thing to do&#34; is admirable.  Most of  us wish we had that kind of nerve.  Well written, and we love to see &#34;justice&#34; in the end.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My whole family has enjoyed Downton Abbey - all three seasons. My husband and I have watched all of the episodes several times. It is almost like visiting good friends!
B00CLT31D6|5.0|A fascinating read, backed up some of my own ideas and gave plenty more. Really a great lesson in frugality.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|A very well organized and fast moving app. Wish the were all this good.<br />Completes searches in A very  short time.
B0026QC0YU|3.0|Again, Tom does his thing to take you on an amazing trip. Loved the escape. The Mission Impossible lives on, Yes it does...
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|With the lack of quality R&B music on the market today, it's made me go back and notice artists I missed the first time around. I just recently got into Joe over the past year or so.  I've been listening to all of his albums, trying to play catch up. Some albums have been better than others.<br /><br />I purchased \\"Doubleback\\" the day it was released and I was not expecting to enjoy it nearly as much as I did. I found myself giving it a second spin the very first day I listened to it! I have to give him his props, I think this is the strongest album in his catalog.<br /><br />Joe delivers a very strong, fine vocal here.  But, the main thing I love about this album is Joe sounds very contemporary here, yet, still manages to keep a more traditional R&B sound intact without having to depend on predictable, \\"sex-you-up\\", cookie-cutter material.  Unlike many of his peers, the music is actually geared towards adults (Yes! He's actually using real musicians on some of the songs!).  It's sad to see artists who are 40+ years old singing songs that would be better suited for a 20+ year old singer.  Donell Jones fell into that trap with his latest album.  Although you may find Joe casually chasing a trend or two here, he pretty much keeps things very simple, traditional and classy.<br /><br />This is a very strong record.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is tired of hearing the hip-hop laced, techo-pop sounds that have plagued so-called \\"contemporary\\" R&B for so many years now.  For those of you who are ready to go back to some real, authentic R&B, \\"Evolution of R&B\\" is the way to go!
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|A realistic story that could be about any of us and missed opportunities. Excellent character development, I really bonded to main character with all his flaws. The story had the tone and irony of a Twilight Zone episode. Easy to read, easy to identify with the characters, and a surprising ending. Delightful! Great Read. I highly recommend. Please write more.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Good app and stores lots of locations even though I live in Phoenix and it's like Groundhogs Day here every day, it's nice to see what's up elsewhere.

1936891026|1.0|I have been a  musician for years, so I thought this book seemed interesting.    here's some of the stupid ideas that you find in this book,  statements like:    'people aren't sick, they are just self-dramatizing'    'Invent a disease: Attention Deficit Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder....they are all marketing ploys'.    PS. I normally don't wish that to people, but in the case of this dimwit of an 'author' , I hope he gets seriously ill. Long term. The A-hole doesn't yet know that to be ill, one doesn't have to be visibly bleeding, dying, or being stuck in a wheelchair, although any of that could happen to anybody, anytime, anyplace. Even so, the 'author' has nothing to worry about, it will just be a 'little dramatizing'. :)    Really? Just last week I met someone who seemed completely ok to me, and he confessed that if he's on a train and someone sits in front of him, he gets s*** scared. The same applies if he walks on a street and someone comes towards him.    The problem is that in the market there's a lot of crap, from 'The Secret' to stupid authors like Pressfield who thinks he knows it all and just because he doesn't get a lot of things, just bashes on people's problems. People who make big deals of stupid little trivial things is not the same as people who have a mental  disorder. Maybe this illustrious 'author' should get some diseases too, then listen to some idiots who tells him 'come on man, you are a little dram queen'.  Obviously this stupid man has never really been there, some people just need for some s*** to happen to them so that they can say 'oh, I didn't think it would feel that bad'. Just go to wikipedia and look at his picture, he's got that stupid smile stamped all over his face and he looks exactly what, after reading his book, I think he is ;)    as for being a musician, I really doubt I need to learn anything from such a stupid and ignorant person with no real insights. No thanks, there's much better than that. I recommend 'Mastery' byRobert Greene over this  ignorable (and ignorant) book.
0345803493|5.0|It's not as hardcore and sultry as the first one, but it's still a great book - kept me wanting for more :)
B00BHASVQC|1.0|GoT has great actors and actresses, the writing is good, not great but i'm a sucker for politics and drama so I stomached the violence at first, however, the show could've been made without showing the killing of babies. What was the director thinking when adding this to the show...it's really unnecessary, they could've just had the king give the orders and not show it, people are not that stupid that they can't understand what's going on... Unfortunately, season 2 has the same sick and disturbing crap in it. At the end of episode 2 they show, well, you hear another baby being eaten by some kind of monster...terrible. How can anyone find this entertaining, you have to be one bored sick loser if you do. I would have given it 4.5 stars if they left out the showing of killing babies.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Names in these novels continue to present a problem.  But, the stories are so beautiful, I forget that I can't pronounce the name.  I will await with patience his next novel.

B000FBJHZS|5.0|Dan Brown has written another exciting book. Can't wait to see what happens next.  I love Dan Brown's books. Wow
6302470021|5.0|This movie is a parody, and its a good one. Its classic and very funny, not in a crude way that so many are used to nowdays, but in a poetic, comedic genius kind of way. Don't look for the blockbuster action flick here. This is one of the two 007 movies that are 'non EON&#34; productions.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is a culmination of all 3 seasons. It is difficult to write star members out of the show and I think Julian Fellowes has done well. I was chagrined when Sybil was deaded but wasn't too shocked at Mathews demise. It was also brilliant killing him off to end a season. Hats off to a splendid show. Now,where is season 4?
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This was a good movie however, it would not play on my computer,I had to end of watching it on my iPad .

0441013597|5.0|This is my absolute favorite book. I love how Frank Herbert, who researched this book for years, brought together so many disparate facts regarding ecology, language, culture, religion, prophecy, conquest and history. In this book I see a bit of Alexander the Great, a bit of Muhammad, a bit of Cyrus the Great perhaps. Just as in history, the stars (or human psychological forces) seem to align just perfectly to make young Paul Atreides the Emperor of the known universe, and the divine Messiah of a new faith, whether he likes it or not... When his father Leto I is put in charge of Arrakis, aka Dune, source of the Spice Melange, necessary for intergalactic travel, a planet with very little moisture, lots of sandstorms, and gigantic Sandworms, and is assassinated by his enemies, Paul and his mother are exiled to the desert and must depend on the Fremen people. Paul becomes a desert dwelling, worm riding, Fremen extraordinaire, known as Muad'dib, and in the process fulfills many of the Messianic expectations of the Fremen people. The Spice Melange which is a narcotic that amplifies foresight and precognition, and this gradually expands Paul's psychological capacity to quite God-like proportions where he can see the effects of the ripples he creates in time and eventually even is able to see things well in advance of their happening. In addition he enter the Spice Agony, whereby the Bene Gesserit like his mother pass on old 'racial' memories to one another, lethal for all males before him, and many females. He survives, and becomes even more Godlike, and circumstances align for him to take revenge on his enemies and conquer Dune and with it, the entire galaxy that depends on its Spice for travel. But, even he can not stop the horde of his zealous devotees from waging a giant jihad across the universe, killing many more than any before him.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I've enjoyed every episode of this show!! It's so well written. I've never been one to watch movies or shows that are horror or frightening , but this show is different. It has a great storyline, and I can't wait to see the next episode!! Love it!!

B005LAIIQC|5.0|I thought was very good with lots of action. Jeremy Renner was good. He couldn't replace Matt Damon but was a good choice for playing a different character.

B000TYWAUA|5.0|I love this movie. I also know a lot of people who don't.<br /><br />I think the reasons people both love and hate this movie are the same. Excessive and graphic violence. Highly stylized (i.e. not too realistic). Tons of unnecessary slow motion shots to name just a few.<br /><br />If you're into blood and gore and you want a really well put together action movie that looks really nice, then watch this movie.
B008OOYALE|5.0|it is a really great game I love it and if u are new to this game and want friends plz add nick9501
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|Truly impressed with the way the story was captured and presented. Wonderful arrangement and very emotional. I would definitely recommend this to others.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|&#34;The Impossible&#34; keeps you engaged from the idyllic opening scenes, through the horrors of tsunami, to the satisfying ending. A true story, it brings us to the on-the-ground reality of a previously unimaginable natural disaster. It is an affirmation of the human spirit, both within the family at the center of the story, and those with whom each members path crosses in the days following the disaster. By following a single family through its trials, we see the experience of the tsunami in ways tv news sound bites could never provide.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Inception is a interesting movie. It keeps you on your toes. The acting is great.  The Plot leaves you to figure out<br /> just what in going on. !!<br />  Thanks , Bobbie McDaniel
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|If this is listed as YA, don't let that sway you.  It is as wonderful a story of first love as you will read.  It grabs you and does not let go.  It can be innocent, sad, wonderful, and gripping all in the same chapter.  Author nails, and I mean nails, the feeling of falling in love in the 80's.  And she nails quirky but very believable characters.<br /><br />While the characters are falling in love you fall in love with them and you nearly panic knowing something bad is coming the entire book (not giving anything away) - you just know there will be a blow up with her step dad.<br /><br />The end is amazing.  Amazing.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW - stop here<br /><br />I love how the author leaves it unknown as to what she said, but it is clear it is one of two \\"three words\\" (IMHO):<br />I love you<br />or<br />just please stop<br /><br />Both of those are beautiful in their own way.  Both work.  Leaving it up to you is wonderful.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This is a great movie for kids . It shows you what life is all<br /> about no matter how you look or seem to be different from anyone else. It is also a great love story. It shows you<br /> how important nature is to everyone and everything. It's a great rounded movie.<br />  Thanks, Bobbie Mc Daniel
B00CIWOJUU|4.0|Claudio Abbado has recorded very little Schumann, and none of it the four symphonies, but he has covered Mendelssohn pretty thoroughly. So it's not a surprise that this new Schumann Second is light and airy enough to be mistaken for Mendelssohn. Its strengths also include orchestral clarity and a nice transparency, which is due in large part to the reduced string section. We are at the opposite pole from Leonard Bernstein's passionate Schumann or Klemperer's titanic Schumann, both with a full orchestral complement. In their hands Schumann's symphonic writing springs directly from the brow of Beethoven.<br /><br />Just because the Orchestra Mozart is small, I don't want to give the impression that Abbado is bolting into the period performance camp, where Schumann has been treated (or mistreated) to by-the-numbers literalism (Zinman) and radical trimming down to forces even Mozart would have found skimpy (Dausgaard); in both cases, the tempos went licketty split, and were, for me, unworkable. In his pacing, Abbado is closer to Szell, although I think, contrary to what the product blurb says, that age has robbed the 80-year-old Abbado of force. It happens. You are still aware of a shaping hand, however, and the style throughout is Romantic (to the point of dreaminess in the slow movement, which is taken as an Andante rather than Schumann's marking of Adagio espressivo - at least the expressiveness is there). The HIP movement has accustomed us to conductors picking any random tempo they care to pick out of thin air, so Abbado's nods away from tradition are easy to adjust to.  The finale could be more rambunctious, but here Abbado lends the score a touch of Mendelssohnian ebbullience, which brings a smile.<br /><br />All told, anyone who wants a stylish Schumann Second in up-to-date sound will be happy with the results, and DG;s close miking guarantees that the bass lines are full and that nothing sounds scrawny. My only warning is that this isn't the most energized reading I've ever heard, and for that reason, Schumann's fervor is dampened. The two familiar overtures, Manfred and Genoveva, continue in the same restrained vein, only more so.ing I've ever heard, and for that reason, Schumann's fervor is dampened.

B0043KK4N6|5.0|The sound track sounds just like the movie. The songs are right in order with the movie. The songs remind you of<br /> what part of the movie you are listing too.<br />  Thanks , Bobbie Mc Daniel
B00499NHLC|5.0|The first episode smartly captures how the pair got together and the other two episodes adroitly depict that analytical and deductive capabilites of Holmes. The episodes have an edgy suspense and the acting is of high quality. Sir A Doyle would have approved it, I believe.<br /><br />Rather unfortunate that there are only 3 episodes in a season.
B002ZG976U|5.0|The story plot was great .! That is just the way life can be in trying to find out in what direction your life is taking you.<br /> Char was great , as always, in her part in the movie. All the actors did a very good job.

B008ALAHA4|5.0|I've been using one since the first Retina MBP came out with the new Magsafe 2 connector.  I had several power bricks I got for locations like work, home, etc, so I didn't have to pull out power wherever I went.  The one in my bag just sits there in case I need power at a client site.<br /><br />Snaps on just as strongly as the regular power plugs do, and holds well.  Never an issue with alignment or power not being connected.<br /><br />For those who say the converter stays connected when they unplug and they remove their power cord from the converter instead, just grab the converter and tip the outside up or down - comes right off and I've never had the power adapter come off of this.<br /><br />I paid the stupid initial price, so for the new low price it's a steal.
B0013ND36G|5.0|This movie , is right in line with the other movies of this kind. I liked the plots of the movie. The visual affects were<br /> great and exciting. You should see this one. !!<br /><br />  Thanks , Bobbie Mc Daniel
034580709X|3.0|This is never going to be Jo Nesbø's best book in fact it has taken him a while to finally release it so that we may gather some background on one of my personal favorite fictional gumshoes, Harry Hole. In this novel the action actually takes place in Australia instead of the freezy fjords of Oslo, Norway like usual. All in all its a decent read and pretty much a must do if you follow the entire series like myself, heres hoping he now loosens up and releases #2 of the Hole series THE COCKROACHES. To me you cant go wrong with Nesbø no matter what he is by far the king of Scandinavia blowing names like Stieg Larsson and the bigot Henning Mankell out of the water. I hope you enjoy discovering Harry's first case as much as I did.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|finally a rock album from David, well worth the wait. He lets you know what you have been missing. Great
1442359315|5.0|This book is so well written, and touched my heart so many times, and felt so true, I do not have enough words to tell you how much it moved me!<br />I had the unabbriged audio version and it was amazing! Some books are better to be read, some to be listened to, and I reccomend you lisen to the authors narration. I truly belive in what the author is saying, and it made me feel more full of life, loved, and knowing that all is well.
B00DU74U74|5.0|It actually turned out a lot better than most movies from books. I strongly recommend this one. Can't wait for more.

B008CPRLP2|5.0|Just as reliable as the desktop version! Just as cost effective too! Love it love it love it. Not much else to say.
B008602KQI|4.0|It had Action, human interest and an interesting vision of the future. I would recomment it. Are we heading that way?
B00CW665VI|5.0|I *loved* this book. It was hysterical. So interesting from the male POV. And while a woman wrote it and I can't be sure if it's how a male really feels, all of his inner thoughts seemed logical, lol. Maybe if I was a guy I'd find fault with Drew's voice and actions, but it felt pretty male-like to me. I loved it when Drew addressed the reader. I cheered when they initially got together. I cringed when he almost ruined it all. I laughed -- OMG I laughed. And I was so very happy with the ending. The trope of the dog finding his one and only true love has been done lots, but this one was very unique and I'll definitely remember it. Nothing about it I didn't like.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Without giving too much away, please tell me this didn't end the way it appears to have ended. Oh my goodness! This season was so compelling, I watched the whole season in one sitting. Not at all what I expected and I'm on the edge of my seat to see what happens in Season 4!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I actually enjoyed reading this novel.  It's well written, with very descriptive language and good character development.  The love scenes are very steamy and not repetitive.  I came to understand each character and grew to love Eva and Gideon.  I admit, the plot took a lot of twists and turns with many different story lines, and we were definitely left hanging in the end.  However, I go through novels so fast, I look forward to the next one and the chance to reed more about them.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Once again I'm glued to the set! Life at Downton continues to unfold during the war as do each of the characters. The storylines are beautifully written and translated to the screen. It's difficult not to get involved with every single one of them. Not to mention Maggie Smith's one-liners. I thought they were good in the first season, but she outdoes herself in the second. Can't wait for the third!!
B0094K1MH2|5.0|This movie takes CG to another level. The faces in this feature are VERY realistic without being creepy. Often the faces aren't expressive, or are strangely so, and the result is weird or confusing for children. The quality of the cg in the movie is AMAZING. Lighting, shadows and details were very realistic when the story called for it, or were somewhat cartoonish when needed for effect. The story was very entertaining, however my grandsons found it a little long and started to lose interest near the end because it was so long. Great movie though, please check it out!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille's wise-cracking character, detective John Corey, kept me engaged and entertained through this whole story.  Well done!<br /><br />Can DeMille keep these stories coming?  I hope so.
B008UX2UIO|2.0|The main character is unbelievable in the things he does.  And the supporting cast is unbelievable in the way they let him get away with what he does without serious consequences.  All in all, too wordy to be humorous.  Any humor is drowned in the philosophical wanderings of Ignatius.  I could never place myself in the situation of this story.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This is a pretty good book and a quick read. The Author does put some stuff in the story just to make some kind of geek point, ad it takes away from the overall story.<br /><br />Some of the characters in the book aren't consistent.<br /><br />I'm not sure how someone who want' alive in the 70s and 80s is going to relate to the challenges in the book.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This Harry Potter collection has all the movies that came out to complement the book series of J. K. Rowlings. It's full of drama and action, and the included additional bonus discs show the behind look on how the film was made, is put together,  interviews with the cast, and other interest facts about the making of each movie. This blu-ray version brings the movies to life, especially if projected on a big screen with a HD projector.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Wasn't expecting much from this film, it snuck up on us. Well worth the rental. Plot was good and the tossed in a twist or two. Fun for all

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I wanted a corded mouse for standard desktop use (I'm a programmer) and one that I could use for games too.  This mouse is a perfect fit, with one minor suggestion for anyone purchasing it: PLUG IT DIRECTLY INTO YOUR PC and NOT A USB HUB! That solved some \\"jerkiness\\" in the mouse pointer immediately.<br /><br />Things I really like about it, the dual profiles that are easy to switch between -- one for my desktop and the second for Call of Duty 4.  The software also allows you to customize for different games and applications and save them off as loadable configuration files -- cool for multiple games or graphics programs.<br /><br />The programmable buttons are pretty good and easy to use.  I have not tried the macros yet and I'm not sure how I would use them yet.<br /><br />For the $$ it is a pretty good multi-purpose mouse. (get it when it's on sale.)

B00B7Y0206|4.0|I got the official youtube app from 1mobile for my kindle fire hd a few weeks ago and I have since removed it after finding this.  The official app is less buggy but it still has some problems on the kindle fire and I don't like the intrusive advertisements. The vTube app here on Amazon still has ads unless you pay 1.99 but they are not nearly as bad. I paid the two bucks anyway because I like it.  I have not yet tired the download feature but everything else seems to work well once you figure it out.<br /><br />At first after signing into youtube with vTube it would crash every time I tried to play a video.  I did some basic troubleshooting and figured out if I go to the video first then add it as a favorite and sign in from there that fixes the problem.  I have not had the problem since even when signing in from the main screen.  It just needed to go through that to fix it for some reason.  There are a few other minor bugs such as a bug when trying to remove \\"favorites\\" or \\"to watch\\" videos it won't disappear until you add another video to it.<br /><br />I actually like how everything behaves on this better than the official youtube app it just took some time to figure it out and work around some of the bugs.  Just try it out for a while and see if you like it.  If you do like it you can pay for it and get rid of all the ads and receive the bonus downloading feature.  If you don't like it you can always get the official from 1mobile or other marketplaces.  Amazon and Google don't have a deal so you can't get the official app from Amazon.  It would be kind of nice to have access to the Play store on the kindle fire but most of the free apps there are also available on other free marketplaces anyway.  Access to the play store will never happen .  I'll leave it at that.  Enjoy!

0399162097|5.0|This extraordinary book is brave and sad and rigorously honest. I cannot remember a novel in recent years with a subject as unique, nor one more sensitively explored. The plot is haunting, the missing daughter like a missing limb, the ending perfect except, of course, it arrives too soon. I could have lived with Rosemary and Fern for hours and hours and days longer. We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves opened my eyes, my mind and my heart. Our ambiguous relationship with animals -- the ones we love, the ones we eat, the ones we fear, the ones we experiment on -- lies at the center of Karen Joy Fowler's novel. Entertaining, intelligent and bittersweet it left me with a million reasons to go Vegan though I know I won't. Not yet. This is a feast of a book and I heartily recommend.

1594203334|2.0|Since there is no shortage of content reviews, I just want to pass on a quick comment on the audio version. I got it to listen to the book while getting other things done. The reader tries to read the book using a terrible French accent when reading lines or quotes that by a French person, or when the author quotes a psychologist/writer/doctor, anyone whose thoughts or comments are metnioned in the book that is also French. The accent is awful and mocking. I'm on chapter five and don't know if I can hold out for the whole thing, it's so annoying. If I knew this before buying the book, I would not have done it.
B008EKMB82|5.0|This was a fabulous book.  Having lived in Japan for two years I could relate to the places and the culture.  Even if you know nothing of Japanese culture this book will show you a lot of it.  Great read.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I didn't know about such &#34;orphan trains&#34; in our past and it was enlightening.  It has its sad moments for sure, but all in all I would recommend it.

0399226907|5.0|He always gets a 5 star rating from me.  He is a great author.  Plus the pictures in this book are very colorful for young children.  This was a gift for my niece's library for her new baby.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|I took me until about page 200 to realize that this book is about everyone, not just the Running People. Everyone is born to run.
0060763280|5.0|A Must Read. logical and easy to read, fun to read. Ekar nails a lot of concerns about money, life, and financial thought. Become a better receiver of what the world is trying to give you. let go of your dang selfish head. Ekar explains why poor people don't need you to join in the misery, you can help more people up if you yourself are doing better! Lot's of humor in these pages, too! Enjoy!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|A very good movie, with lots of laughs.  Who knew murder and twisted crooked politics could be this much fun.
0062255657|2.0|The Good: Neil Gaiman has a way with words, making even the dullest or most bizarre of stories feel almost poetical. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is no exception. The book flows beautifully and quickly, much quicker than even it's short length would suggest.<br /><br />The Bad: The story was just bizarre. It comes off as a children's story written for adults - much like the original fairy tales. Which could have worked well, but just didn't. Suicide, infidelity, child abuse, and what I believe to be fairies, although it was never really spelled out. It was beautifully written, but a jumbled mess.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|More acorns please this would be awesome if u got more chances and free acorns I can'<br />buy them at the crazy prices it should be a thousand for a buck or more.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|it was a little chopping making it hard to follow.  Normally the book is better than the movie but in this case I think that it is the opposite.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Bored? Need to get a bit frustrated solving Spidery?<br />Use the UnDo feature and try again.<br />Tap to move is great when in the clear but not always the best.<br />Enjoy I do
B005LAIHPY|5.0|There are 3 things I liked about the movie:  1) It has a good plot--like Top Gun where you have the cocky hero who learns humility, 2)  The scenery and animation is well done--loved the Hawaii scenes, and 3) acting is pretty good.  The main guy is pretty convincing, very handsome and he makes the action scenes come alive.  The interaction between him and the Japanese commander are very well played, and the supporting seamen are fun to watch.  The girl is also very pretty and statuesque.  Colors are very good, music fine.  Would like a Battleship 2, Alien Revenge.
140006922X|1.0|I was really disappointed with this book.  Mr. Aslan is merely looking at Jesus though the eyes of a Muslim.<br />Clearly the Jesus of the Koran is not the Jesus of Christianity.<br />This is a shameful and quite honestly a biased book.<br />I've watched Mr. Alan's defensive interviews lately and he comes across rather sadly.<br />I can't believe I enjoyed his previous book, No God But God.  Where he clearly states his belief in Allah.<br />All these reviews that attack me are baseless because I am not even a Christian.<br />But, I am not going to attack Christianity just to curry favor with liberals.
B009POCG0Y|4.0|I did not know the history behind this, the play, director etc . . . I did not realize when I rented it that it's a black comedy . . . it sucked me in, it had me laughing at the weirdest moments . . . the people are creepy, the plot is creepy, the actors were awesome! The ending blew me away . . . not for the goody goody, faint of heart movie goer . . . but great for people that appreciate the shock value, it had me going trying to figure it all out right to the end . . . great cast . . . I am surprised that a reviewer mentioned that everyone other than MM are unknown actors, lots of well known actors, all outstanding in this movie . . .

B008476HBM|4.0|For me it was a little slow at first, but got more interesting as it went along. Because of how popular it is, I  guessed I just expected more.
B000XUBF3I|5.0|Marla is an excellent writer and her website is awesome.  Her website and book are bit too silly for my tastes.  I don't have cleaning or order issues but I like to read homemaking books.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This movie is great.  My husband and I love it.  Great story, acting, and funny!  The bonus features are good too.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I am really enjoying this.  I just downloaded it a few minutes ago.  I didn't want to stop playing long enough to do this review.  Colors are great.  This will help to keep my mind sharp.
B0068CEH5S|5.0|Stewart and Scott do battle over a soldier, Gazzara, accused of shooting to death a man who allegedly raped Gazzara's wife.  Wonderful to see, Jospeh N. Welch, one of the few who stood up to Joseph McCarthy &#34;Have you no sense of decency. sir?&#34; playing the judge in this film.  Lee Remick, who play Gazzara's wife, is superb, with just the right amount of seductive alure, hints of 'availabiity' and fear of her husband to put doubts in the viewer's minds.  Also a pleasure to see Arthur O'Connell, one of the very best character actors, in this film, check out his performance in the Marilyn Monroe 'vehicle'  Bus Stop.  Preminger's direction is commanding and adroit throughout this piece.  Loved the jazz musical score too.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I loved returning to my childhood, when I read this book many times and was surprised that even as an adult it was enjoyable. The  use of language was good the rapture of the early morning in the garden etc and the history of the times as things have changed so much today.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Great little game.. A lot of selections...from easy to hard..Glad I found this one..Easy to understand..<br />Backgrounds are rather nice...
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is one of the best apps! It gives you free music and YouTube! Who wouldn't buy it? I love it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|There is nothing bad about this game.  I just wish the updates came out more frequently.  If you want cheats look up pocketinveditor on the app store, it's extremely helpful for your first time in the game.
B0014NDXGA|3.0|To be fair, this product does exactly what it is supposed to; i simply feel it is a little too expensive, especialy when you consider how long these have been around for, and that the newer models have a lot more features. Very satisfied though!
034580404X|5.0|The book is nice and hot.  It keeps you wanting to read more of it.  Finished the first book in 1 week, cant wait to start on the 2nd book.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I have read many books on the craft of writing, but this is by far the best. And who better than to give this advice than the King himself? Even if you are not an aspiring writer, this book has many little tidbits from King's personal life that are intriguing, even spooky.<br />Read a lot, write a lot, and remember that sometimes you just have to say sh%#!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I love TED! And this app is great. It works beautifully on my kindle fire hd. I've had no issues at all with this app.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This is Khaled Hosseini's best novel by far. There are so many things Americans are shielded from, and Mr. Hosseini brings it to the forefront. Sure, there are many real stories of the Taliban and the conditions in Afghanistan, but very few writers are able to weave these tales so powerfully.<br />A relationship between two women grows into a forceful friendship that keeps them both alive. Both married to the same tyrant husband, the two women find together a way to survive under the influence of the Taliban. It is in these small moments of friendship that one of the women, Mariam-whose life has been utterly tragic-realizes what it feels like to love and be loved, to dream.<br />This is a must read; one of my absolute favorite works of fiction.
B006HGXGWU|2.0|There have been fascinating film studies of mental illness. This isn't one of them. There have been fascinating film studies of paranoia. This isn't one of them either. There have been fascinating film studies of the paranormal and the supernatural, but nope, sorry, it's not one of those either.<br /><br />This is a film that takes forever to get where it's going and then when it gets there, it's nowhere.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm quite ashamed that I actually broke down and bought this garbage, but sometimes I guess you just have to learn the hard way.<br />The writing is just downright BAD, even for a fun speed read-which this is NOT!<br />I think most women can agree that when you lose your virginity, this is not how great it feels. I think we can also agree that a woman isn't able to orgasm at the sound of a sexy man saying, \\"come now.\\" Completely ridiculous!<br />I could have also done without all the \\"inner goddess\\" stuff and the \\"oh my's.\\"<br />Bottom line, if you feel compelled to read this, borrow it. Your hard-earned money is NOT worth it!<br /><br />Even Jackie Collins thinks this book is junk. Read her books instead of this.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This was just what I was looking for. This GAME sucks you in and you'll spend hours enjoying it. I know my family really loved it. Worth every dollar
B0072OFM28|3.0|Great show. Loved every minute watching it. Buying it used it a risky deal. I purchased a used DVD set of this and it came dirty and scratched. Took 5 minutes to clean it so it would actually read, not big deal. It isn't something that should be sold scratched and dirty however.
B00CLVEPFC|5.0|This movie is a real original.  Good story, great special effects and makeup, some laughs, suspense, and a lot of action.  I'm not really a fan of Jeremy Renner, Famke Janssen's career has been hit-and-miss as far as her movies, and Gemma Arterton is still a new face in movies, but they were all really good in this movie.  Famke makes an incredibly hot evil witch!<br /><br />I've seen both the rated and unrated versions of this movie and the unrated version adds about 5 minutes of new footage over the whole the movie, but its good gory stuff they left out of the theaters, so for the same price you should go for the unrated.  Scored the download from Amazon on sale for 8 bucks and I'm glad to add this movie to my collection.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Excellent tablet that is easy, portable and does everything I want it to do. Don't know how I got along without it.

B00992CF6W|5.0|it is not computer version but it is still a great game and keeps getting better with each update. And is one of the best multiplayer game on the app store
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|As one of the movie critics said, Tintin has a great job: he is a reporter who only goes on adventure and doesn't seem to write any article at all, but he is getting famous anyway!<br /><br />For the people who knows Tintin, the comic book (or &#34;Bande Dessinée&#34; as we say in France), The adventures of Tintin are a mix of &#34;The Crab with the Golden Claws&#34; and &#34;The Secret of the Unicorn&#34;. While looking to pierce the mystery of the Unicorn, Tintin and Snowy encounter Capitain Haddock, and the three of them continue this adventure through the Karaboudjan (Haddock's ship), the Sahara, and Brussels.<br /><br />Visually speaking, this movie is by far the most accomplished animation movie ever made. This can be seen with the characters, who are all amazingly drawn and animated at a point it is troubling. They look indeed so real, but yet specific &#34;Comic book&#34; elements are kept. That allows Spielberg to show unbelievable scene - like the one in Bagghar - that would annoy in a realistic movies, but are simply enjoyed in this case. You can compare this to Myazaki's movies, which shows believable character in situation not so believable, but some little moments (inertia, size of the tears, etc.) help for the movie coherence.<br />So yes, the characters animation is astonishing. The action scenes are great too, though not as detailed as the characters. Yet a 10/10 for the reatlisation for sure!<br /><br />As for the story, many people got upset that two stories are mixed to produce one movie, or that Professor Calculus wasn't introduce. The fact is that the movie feels a bit long - especially at the end - and has multiple slow moments. I think people who read Tintin as a kid/teenager had a &#34;too much/too little&#34; feeling after this movie, hoping for more and regretting some parts.<br />My understanding is that Spielberg use these Comics to make an adventure movie, and he succeeded in it: it is thrilling, interesting, funny and Comic-y. However, there are two moments that creates problem.<br /> - The first is the rememberance of Haddock about his ancestor, which is a way to introduce the plot of the next movie, more than explaining this movie's story. This wasn't necessary, and could have been kept for the beginning of the second movie.<br /> - The second is the final battle. It lacks (in my opinion) the intensity shown during the scene in Bagghar. Therefore, you end the movie on a smaller note than what you would expect, and therefore a bit disapointment<br /><br />Apart from these points, there is no deception.<br />If you are a kid, you will enjoy all of the adventures and the insults Capitain Haddock is yelling.<br />If you are a young adult, you will be fascinating by the visual quality of this movie.<br />If you are an older adult, you will appreciate this kid movie (because it is a kid movie) without the bad humour so many animation movies are showing these time.. And the hero is actually a human, not a snail or a car, yay!
1906735875|4.0|ok when i was kid  i like the judge dredd movie with Sylvester Stallone, and when i grow i watch the new dredd loved it more then sly version . more i watch dredd more i crave for Justice!! Fortunately i have an amazon account and a job so i bought the first case file and i loved it.it's an comic book series from Britain. it starts out slow and ends with little excitement. best way i can put it a great book to read on your down time. best way i can put it if you love  sci-fi and crime you love dredd no doubt about it. just a little reminder it the beginning of the series and it was from the the 70's so expect a lot of outlandish thing in the series. and so here's my score 4 out 5.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its the best on my 360 and now my kindle, cant go without it now but now the best part is that you can play online
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Very good game, too bad that is only free for a few games per day. Thats my one and only sugestion.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|The ap does what it says but just doesn't render as well as I would have hoped. I've used it on a variety of photo's and somehow it just doesn't really make them pop.<br /><br />I wish it was easier to try different affects and adjust the setting live before taking the picture. I would make it much easier to sort out what works best in that situation.<br /><br />I also think it need more quality art modes. I've never gotten the oil paint look to look decent on anything. The watercolor and pastel are also pretty lackluster. There are application that do a much better job.
B0063M22QO|2.0|You get to play the one game (Classic), but to play the other two games, you have to qualify somehow
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Joe Satriani is the Man. I have been loving his music since the 80's. This release is a little on the mellow side, but it is still pretty good.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|THIS IS ALSO ONE OF THE BETTER BOOKS THAT JOHN GRISHAM HAS WRITTEN.  VERY GOOD MUST TAKE THE TIE TO READ
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|If you like plots that are hard to figure out, you will like this one.  I found the movie boring.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I like the fact that you don't HAVE to spend money if you don't want to. if you cant get to it for awhile that's ok too. just a fun simple game
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|Bought this for my wife, The Oz Queen. She liked it. Personally I didn't think it was as good as the &#34;original&#34; Wizard of Oz or the recent Oz the Great and Powerful.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|Every show kept us on the edge of our seat. Great cast and can't wait for the next season. Great!
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|\\"Spoiler\\".  Well this movie kinda plays out as a military superhero without a costume.  Mostly it seems like Tom Cruise bragging a lot and then beating a bunch of people up.  I know this seems so rare.  I mean wow, a Tom Cruise movie where he brags a lot and beats people up or wins something.  These movies are so rare.  It's not a great script and it's not Tom's best work.  This movie could have been better if there was a personal plot arch for Tom's Character.  You could easily replace the title \\"Jack Reacher\\" for \\"24, Rouge Agent\\" and have it in the 24 universe and have CTU as the military faction that deals with \\"Jack\\".  It would have probably made more money at the box office too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Beautifully filmed, complex characters, lovely period costumes and well written script. Husband I can't get enough of Downton Abbey. Love it!
B00BX8PG5M|4.0|I loved everything about this movie other than the fact that it was in English.  It had some of my favorite actors ever and the story, effects, sound costuming etc were all amazing.  It was one of the best cold war dramas \\"based on real events\\" I have ever seen.  I watched it as is and wished I could have seen it in Russian with english subtitles.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The acting, character development and humor are all way above that of an average TV show. I don't have a lot of free time, so to spend it watching something it has to be worth it. Suits is a pleasure to watch and I love the psychological aspects of the way they calculate and plan for legal situations. The love story and general plot is a little far fetched but I still enjoy it and just play along. Definitely worth checking out. I was happy to see Season 2 was even better than the 1st!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game! Challenging but not impossible to figure out the rooms like some of the other games.<br />Can't wait for new rooms to be created.
0756405890|5.0|A book I found worth reading slowly, enjoying the story.  The ideas are quite interesting and fairly novel and the story unfolds carefully avoiding too much early action.  A decent read.
B000HL2J0G|4.0|Even tho I was younger and somewhat remember this show I just can believe how well thoughtout MacGyver really was when he fashioned things together to get the job completed!!!
B001KQEE0U|4.0|Unlike the others who have left very bias comments about this album. I think the album is good, not great. I love 2Pac and I think that his peak was reached with this album. However his lyrical flow is pretty basic. Yes he has some nice beats thru out the album and I love 16 songs off the album, I would have to say the album was his greatest but I have heard better. I judge great albums by not having to skip over many songs, and unfortunately there are a few songs that I would rather not listen to. This album is far better than any album that his name has ever been on excluding none. You know you're in for something special when the 1st track Ambitionz of Ridah come on \\"I wont deny it, I'm straight ridah, you dont want to f#$% wit me\\" however the lyrics arent spectacular but the song does get you hype. I love most of the album and definetly recommend buying it or at least listening to it, however dont be sold on all these other bias comments claiming its a masterpiece, you listen to it and be your own judge.
0226264211|5.0|I love reading Friedman's works. He's one of the real 'heavyweights' when it comes to economics.  As far as I'm concerned, there are no living economists that are even somewhat close to his caliber.<br /><br />He also has a PBS series 'free to choose' - you can watch it on youtube for free - if you want to know if you'll like this book, watch some of his one hour films!  They're wonderfully 80s, but the ideas are just as applicable today.  His predictions and ideas nearly 3 decades ago are still just as applicable today.<br /><br />Although at first blush many of his ideas sound somewhat hard to digest / believe, but after getting his explanation of the topic at hand, along with real world examples, his points come across loud and clear - and easy to understand.  It seems to me as though Friedman is probably about the last of the great economists.  His ideas are rooted firmly in evidence and common sense (very much in opposition to the economists of the current years).  His case for political and economic freedom - and the accompanying reasons for a small and non-intrusive government come across clear as a bell.<br /><br />Really a very enlightening read.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|It is a bit overstuffed, but I think the spirit of the movie is right. It is a quirky fun adventure tale, and I think Martin Freeman does a pretty good job as Bilbo, especially in the opening dialogue with Gandalf. Another standout performance was Ken Stott as Balin the dwarf.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it yet, it is definitely worth a look. It won't blow you away, but if you like dwarves and hobbits and trolls, it will entertain you.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This is a very funny movie. Paul is a fun loving alien with a great sense of humor. He is a little raunchy, though.  When we watched this movie on HBO we knew it would be a great movie to own. I have Prime so the movie arrived in two days.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is a wonderful app. It is extremely useful and works very well. I would recommend it for all. It is especially good for sharing files between different devices with ease.

B001F12J0C|5.0|I LOVE these movies -- which is why I bought the trilogy and the set is neatly tucked into a sleeve with very thin plastic cases.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The first book is a little slow in the beginning, but once it gets moving it is a good story.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Intense but very well done.  My husband and I grew up watching the original Star Trek and found this version to be incredibly well done and entertaining.  No complaints from this Trek Camp!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Truly terrible writing. I have never returned a book but after reading about 40 pages I returned it because it was so bad.
B005LF9IO8|5.0|WOW!!!  Incredible acting and intense action. Full of suspense and surprises.  We are on the edge of our seats from start to finish.  Amazing young actress playing Hanna!!!!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Fun and addictive to play. Lots of fun. Even when a level is difficult to beat, fun to play. Can't put it down.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Extremely engaging story; love the thorough description of people by the author.<br />Got this for my Kindle and will purchase a hard copy for my friend!
B00785P2QC|5.0|love this game cant stop playing it glad I found it plan on trying out other games like it hopefully your other games are just as great very addictive play it constantly my kids play also they cant get enough either
B00007GZQI|1.0|I think this is my very first one-star review for Amazon.<br /><br />I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1969. I probably saw it only because it had a Beatle in it (Ringo). I seem to recall enjoying it at the time, but it definitely has not worn well over the years. No, indeed. Infantile humor (or perhaps \\"humour\\", considering how very British this production is), the barest outline of a plot (it resembles nothing so much as a \\"worst of\\" collection of really bad SNL skits), and no acting whatsoever. The cast certainly phoned in their performances for this one - perhaps they were all too aware of how utterly stupid the thing was. But all of that would have been forgivable were the finished product in some way actually entertaining. But sadly, it is not. Watching it is like rubbernecking a traffic accident from the opposite lanes. I could not even finish it. I'm actually considering tossing out the copy I bought. I know for a certainty that I'll never attempt a second viewing, so for now it's just taking up space in my collection.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Season 1, Great.....Season 2, Wow..Better...!  Season 3.......Hard to believe, but Much, Much, Better.....! This is Hands down, The best Show on TV.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I'm in grad school. My time is critical, so when I work out, it needs to mean something. Jillian does not waste my time and I feel so worked and invigorated after every video session. And you can't beat the price!
B000VSAEYI|4.0|We have already used this 4 times in the first week of owning it. We have inflated and deflated it that many times as well and so far it has held up. the little throw rings don't seem to hold air that great, but they do the job. My son received this for his first birthday and we had 3 of his friends over ranging from 10 months to 13 months the other day and they all loved it. I am sure 2 and 3 year olds would too, but the depth is great for this age to crawl around in the water, stand up holding on to the edge, and just play in. All the moms were asking about it as well b/c they were so impressed with how fun it was for them. I obviously haven't had it for a long period of time yet, but so far, it seems really durable, especially considering I (carefully) used our air compressor to blow it up (which it says not to do).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|really love this game.  wish that it would sync progress across platforms.  but other than that its great. fun fun fun
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game every. sooooooooo worth the money and it upgrades every year with out you upgrading it. hope you really enjoy it like I have.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Cute game with a good concept.  My wife and son also enjoy it.  Would love to see it expanded to keep the gameplay interesting.
B00000K3D4|5.0|i was craving 80s fantasy at this point in life and remembered about seeing this movie as a teenager. so basically, i then bought it, watched it, fell in love again, watched it some more and downloaded some bowie songs on iTunes. it was a really good time.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I've owned many higher priced watches before, and this is honestly the best watch I've owned. Looks like it would cost $500, and works like it too, but you are only paying for a fraction of that price. I will continue to buy this brand.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This movie was okay. There were several funny parts, a couple very loveable characters, and a predictable ending. I would watch again but wouldn't pay for the movie *streamed free from Amazon Prime*.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I became addicted to the show. The show was really great. If you like dorama you will like this tv show
0765325950|5.0|I rarely purchase books when they are first released - I made this exception without hesitation, and from cover to cover it never failed to disappoint. A truly Excellent finale to an Excellent series!<br /><br />The physical book was of very good quality as well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good, but tough, at least for me.  I got to room #6 and cannot get any farther.  Any help would be appreciated!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game runs smooth thanks for making it,plenty of options and really fun to play.waiting for you to make more games
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun game to play when your really bored. Not something I would play all the time, but fun none the less.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|it was all okay at the beginning but now suddenly the pictures on my farm doesn't load ......and its really ANNOYING  to play without the pics!! plzzz fix it :-(
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Short quick bites of running game. Easy to pick up, quick to learn, fun to challenge yourself against and overall a decent time passer for short bites of speed gaming on the go. A bit light on content but overall enjoyable and easy fun.<br /><br />For more of my Android reviews check me out at Android Parlor, or at WordPress at voiceofdamnation.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This 'on-going' drama is wonderful in so many ways.<br /> The setting is a 'for reals' castle. So elegant...<br />The dialog is , well, British and in most cases period appropriate. I have heard  one or two cliches that were too early in history to be used.<br />The clothes, both men's and women's are just a delight to see.<br />But here is my favorite part: there are kindnesses shown to the servants that I had thought were not part of the master/servant equation. There is genuine respect for a job well done .<br />I am waiting impatiently for the rest of the story to unfold.
B00BP4WAZS|1.0|I can't watch the hd on my computer... The movies probably good but I want to be able to watch it...
0674048849|2.0|The stars are for this specific edition, and have nothing to do with the text Jane Austen wrote a couple of centuries ago.  That one merits full five stars.  I would have expected MUCH better from HUP.<br />The heft of the book is surprising, but it is nice to read and hold (if you like large books, which I do).<br />The large number (100? probably more) of images pictures and illuminations are a mixed lot.  Many are of independent interest (that is, independently of their relevance to the book or the story, which is not too often), and too many were not helpful or illuminating in any conceivable way.<br />The annotations are a different matter.  Entirely haphazard.  Many---typically the short ones---are quite helpful, and at least as many go on a tangent which is just a waste of time and space---because this is often the case with the longer disquisitions about cuisine or couture.  If you try to map them to the text, to see the relevance, there is hardly a purchase, a nook for a hook. at least, I found them that way.<br />And then what is missing: a list of characters with a few words for each; and a somewhat descriptive  table of contents,needed for the reader who read the book, and wants to find certain items, looks for specific scenes etc.  Both loom large for me in the compass of annotations of a classic novel.
0061351342|5.0|The best book ever written. You will not regret. I have given many copies away to my students. Buy it
B004DLPXAO|2.0|The Kindle app for Android is the least comfortable and pleasant of the Android eReader apps; it;'s not nearly as nice as the Kindle itself or the Nook app for Android
B000069HJI|5.0|Memorable lyrics, catchy melodies. This is a nice CD to round out your collection. Nice instrumentation and pleasant music. I would highly recommend this CD. It is an all-time favorite of mine.
B00DU74U74|2.0|The biggest problem with this film is that it is incredibly long and incredibly slow, and most of it is focused on the heroine walking around talking to herself. Also, some scenes and dialogue remind me of the fantasy film scenes in Gentleman Broncos.
B000BQ7BX2|3.0|These discs had problems. Some were duplicated and did not have unique symphonies as described. I would recommend staying away from this collection!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This is probably the best American novel I have ever read. It should be required reading in American Lit. courses. It is just so Perfect!
B000002H7I|5.0|Tracy is definitely at her best in this CD. Her original lyrics and social consciousness are evident throughout. Full of feeling and conviction. I would highly recommend this CD!
B007Y2W44W|5.0|This album is FANTASTIC. Nile holds true to their dominate heavy sound. Vocals for me Really stood out here! Amazing. Song writing and musicianship doesnt fall short one cent here. Everysong song is just death metal art! And did i mention that amazing artwork?<br /><br />Saw the aniversary show in NC, 2 compleatly BRUTAL sets from new and old material, even got to me meet Karl Sanders! One hell of a guy. They make this look so easy!! Nile truly has one strong lasting legacy.
B000002MG1|5.0|This is some excellent music from REM. CD is a pleasure to listen to. The moods of the various pieces vary but it is a solid listen!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is like a mini point and click mystery.  The levels are challenging but not too hard.  I just wish there were more.  Not bad for free though! I enjoyed it!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|You get what you pay for.  If you are looking for just a basic working copy of the films, this is a great deal.  They don't have any of the extras (as indicated from teh seller).
1780721676|4.0|I like this book and fasting once in a while has helped curve my appetite.  You have to follow the diet completely or you get a very bad headache.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is pretty darn good, I mean. For something on  kindle to look close to on  Of the games I play on my xbox is pretty awesome
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|The protagonist of this newest Evil Dead film, in attempting to find freedom from chemical dependency and consolation for the loss of her mother, finds herself in a bubbling cauldron of supernatural trauma while friends with good intentions, ironically only add to her misery.<br /><br />She is violated in the worst imaginable ways and literally loses herself; she is violently and cruelly murdered, subsequently resurrected and found to be in her right mind for possibly the first time in years only to become the target of a nightmarish terror where she is attacked and brutally mutilated and driven to become utterly ruthless in a world where evil forces reign supreme in order to survive.<br /><br />This film possesses none of the surreal charm of the first 3, using an abundance of shocking violence to thrust a terribly damaged heroine along a path of survival at any cost towards a hollow triumph in the midst of overshadowing despair.  Ya...it's scary, and absolutely not campy like it's franchise predecessors but consequently contains no humor either and, as I suspect you can tell from this review, I found this movie to be very depressing to the point I couldn't engage my willing suspension of disbelief and simply enjoy.  :(
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This is one of my favorite ways to view YouTube. I think it's the best client I have ever used, and I prefer it to the official app.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like it. It's easy to use, uncomplicated and works great. No bells and whistles but you don't need them.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Can't wait fir more there are so many possibilities and different directions for the next book I hope it comes out soon
B0089EHWQE|4.0|The heroine is a twenty seven year old lower class girl who takes a job as an aide to an upper class disabled man her age. Their differences open them both up to new insights about the others world. It's a Pygmalion tale charmingly told.<br />I have never read anything by this author but will search her out in the future for a light but absorbing read.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This game is very nice, surpassed the expectations...all<br />Though they made us wait a lot for this game it was worth waiting.....
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I am a fan of The Good Wife but didn't start watching until after season 2 so we are enjoying it greatly.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The game is good but I wish the updates would come out as fast like IPhones and iPod touches this would be a five star if kindle got updates when IOS get the updates but this app is very fun to play
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I loved how they combined this movies plot with the previous movies of Thor, Iron man, and Captain America and all the actors were the same actors from those movies. This movie was more like a sequel to those movies. Also the special effects were superb. So I gave this movie five stars just because of the plot.
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|I purchased this to do recordings on my iPhone. I then find out (after trying it and no sound is being recorded) that I need another cord/adaptor for it to work.<br /><br />I then locate this adaptor on Amazon, but it can't be sent to Australia for some reason.<br /><br />So now I'm stuck with a lapel mic which I can't use!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|It is a great movie...one I hope to be able to add to my collection. It has a few twists that was nice...it was not totally predictable.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is probably my favorite book now, I thought I wouldn't like it much, because of the journal format but I think maybe that's why I connected so well with Charlie. I could feel his happiness, his depression, his pain, his confusion, etc. But I don't cry with books because I usually can't make that super big connection, by  I cried continuously with this book. It left me shaken and I can honestly say this is on  of the most well written books ever. I won't say much about the plot because I don't want to spoil anything but every single word in the book is as important as the other. Anyone can read the book but not everyone can actually understand it so I would give  it for teens and adults because children wouldn't connect to it the same way.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|The prestige is probably one of the best movies I've seen. Its got 3 of the coolest actors, its mysterious and intense. And you try and guess what happens next but it totally 180's you melts your brain. Watch it you won't be disappointed
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app it's so cool!!! But I have the new update for the iPod. Why not the kindle? Amazon needs to get this updated. Listeners more apps
0066620996|5.0|This book gave you insight into the tools for business success. It explains how to get the bus with the right people sitting in the right seat. Easy to read and lots of good tips..
B00C04H2VO|3.0|These are advertised as two inches (presumably, they mean in height), but only one of them -- the Gru figure -- is that tall, and only just.  The shortest minion is about 1.3\\".  The detail appears good, however.
159463176X|5.0|Not written the same way that his previous two books were, but it fit the theme of this book perfectly! I loved it, easily ranks up there with one the the best books I've read. I highly recommend it, it's a great story of the bonds of siblings.
B007IK44CK|4.0|I realize Tom Cruise is a little on the wacky side in real life but I've never had my action-movie dollar put to better use as I have when it's in a Tom Cruise movie. The man has work ethic and Ghost Protocol is no exception. I've seen this movie a few times since I bought it.<br /><br />You also might give Knight and Day a try. That's more of a Romantic Comandy Action film but it's still pretty great and got a bum rap at the box office.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|If you loved \\"College Dropout\\" and \\"Graduation\\" and \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" then chances are you will absolutely loathe this album.  I never listened to \\"808s and Heartbreak\\" other than the songs on the radio so I can't compare it to that, but this album is the farthest thing from good Kanye that I can imagine.  I listened to the album all the way through and unless I hear \\"Black Skinhead\\" on Shade 45, I will never listen to a track off this album again.  I'll just listen to the old stuff instead, and hope he puts something like that out again someday.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I've pretty much enjoyed every movie that's come out of this franchise. It was pretty brilliant on the studio's part to create this business model which allows them to consistently put some of the hottest actors together in a catalogue of films.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The kids love to play when they come over. I do wish you didn't have to wait so long for thing's to be built. They get bored waiting.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I had just come from the movie and was discussing some plot points with my sister. I decided to read the book to find the answer to our questions. I found the book story line was quite different from the movie.  Sometimes this ends up ruining one or the other for the reader/viewer, but I loved both the movie and the book!

B004FDPOHC|5.0|This soundtrack was composed by Daft Punk. That is a lot of information in and of itself. They music, with its great beat and computerized sound, really helped being to life a computer world.<br /><br />I bought this album for writing, but it's also a great album to just listen to in the car or even working out.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Excellent actors,beautiful landscape.sweet tender comical,lovable plots.I am enjoying them all so much.Such a joy to watch,I am hooked.Went thru two seasons already this week.My only complaint is,they go by too fast.So actually no complaints at all.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|How many one star reviews. will it take for weather channel to give us back the app we love. I gave up trying to figure it out.  I don't need senseless confusion in my life.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Loved the book and the other two in this &#34;TRILOGY&#34; but it turns out that it is not a trilogy after all. That is what stinks. I was thinking I was going to come to the end of the story line and low and behold.....NOT!!! And not only that, the next book is not even to press yet and no date for release. I am OCD and like to read books in secession. This should not be marketed as a trilogy!!!!! But dang I cannot wait to get my hands on the fourth book!!! HURRY!!!!
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I'm half way through and really like Johnson's style. I see why it was chosen in a world bulging with cops and law shows.
B000088SYA|5.0|I have this quirk about being disturbed at home without a call beforehand and I heard this song, Who Can It Be Now?, and remembering it from younger days, I just had to have it.  I get a hoot out of playing it when somebody knocks on the door unexpectedly.  Bought a lot of music through Amazon and will continue to add to my collection. Vendors are top notch!!!

B00280LYHS|4.0|Percy Jackson and the Last Olympian is thrilling to the last chapter. Buckle up for a heart racing ride through monster filed New York City.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I decided to read the book after watching the new movie, by the same name.  I'd read that the book was nothing like the movie and wanted to see what the differences were.<br /><br />The book is completely different.  I really enjoyed it.  It was written like a history text rather than an action movie.  It did bring the complete desolation of the events to really hit home.  To read someone's first hand account of how the Zombies and the War affected them is very heart rending.  It makes it more real.  The movie was obviously done as more of an action driven story and didn't at all reflect the intent of this book.<br /><br />It is really worth the read, but do not expect an overall resolution.  It also doesn't offer a complete explanation of why the zombies first came into being.  Be prepared to read between the lines with a lot of the political ramifications of the Zombie War.  It is definitely worth the read.
B00280LYIM|4.0|While there are some technical flaws in the writing, Percy Jackson is a wonderful series to get lost in. It's easy to read and full of imagination. Two thumbs up!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I find the newest version to be confusing an difficult to maneuver. I liked the older version better. But the weather is always fun to watch.
1451626088|5.0|I must say that I truly and completely loved this book. I could not put it down. This book is one of those books I wish I could unread just so I could read it all over again and experience it for the first time all over again. I know that it may not be completely historically accurate, but it is a great book. I found it very interesting compared to The White Queen and The Red Queen. The characters that I became somewhat attached to in The White Queen and The Red Queen became the enemies of the characters in this book. It's quite a switch. It made me rethink my impression about all the characters. I realize that some people might find this too complicated, but I enjoyed it all the more because of that. Keep in mind that it is not 100% historically accurate, but, then again, most historical fiction novels these days aren't. I don't want to spoil it or anything, but remember: not everything is as it seems (another aspect I loved about it).
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|Getting ready to put plans together to start my own backyard aquaponic system in a greenhouse in my backyard.  Very informative.  I am sure I will be reading this and rereading this as I get my system setup
B0002OERI0|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the band's best records. I love all the songs! I highly recommend this to anyone!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Not too good, not too bad. It's an ok game if you have nothing better to do. Screen resolution on a kidle makes some items very hard to find.
1781162646|3.0|This book was certainly nothing like the \\"usual\\" Stephen King. It was a lighthearted summer story about a young man that couldn't seem to get over his girlfriend. The carnival life was interesting; the boy's work ethic is pretty hard to believe. I kept waiting for the creepiness, but it was not there.  I think about \\"The Pet Cemetery\\" which stopped me in the middle it was so intense and I just was not able to finish.  Pick this up at the discount bin.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My kids (9yrs old) love this game and can't seem to get enough!<br />1 bummer for them.......At their age they are not allowed on facebook or similar websites so they must use their gems to skip those goals.
B00D7JQJFG|4.0|In the plot of the game The Last Of Us, father and daughter, Joel and Ellie, are survivors travelling across a dystopian America. The book The Art Of The Last Of Us shows the incredibly rich detail that went into the atmosphere of the game and the characters encountered along the way. The game took three and a half years to complete and the hard work shows.<br /><br />The game is set about 20 years after cities have been left to those who have been affected by a plague, and plants are taking over urban areas. There are safe zones that have been protected with traps, and there are environmental issues like snow. The dilapidated environments are detailed and definitely look more realistic than those on the television show The Walking Dead (who mows the lawns on that show? The zombies?!?). Care is given to the types of clothing and gear that survivors would gravitate towards, and the evolution of design for the main characters is shown. The plague victims are shown and they are scary, with fungus growing and bursting out from their once human frames.<br /><br />The book begins with an introduction by Game Director Bruce Straley and Creative Director Neil Druckmann. Computer games have reached an immersive level of detail and storytelling. Many times more immersive than major motion pictures. Based on the art in this book, this game looks amazing and terrifying.
B009IJJ5B4|2.0|It's not very creative or thought provoking. In fact, it generally falls flat as it attempts to break new ground. While it's likely you'll find a few original ideas, 'The Original' is far superior to this adaptation. I'd recommend seeking the classic rather than this modern adaptation.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|I own every album in the Sabbath catalog. Different eras have different 'feels', with strength and weaknesses. Because 13 was highly anticipated, I didn't want to distort my thinking by listening to reviews before hand. I wanted to give it an honest review. When the single 'God is Dead?' was released I wasn't into it. However my fears proved unfounded when I played the first track 'End of the Beginning' which is true EPIC Sabbath. The entire album has elements and dips into previous material, but expanded and changed sufficiently as to not be just a rehash of older albums. I've listened to it many times and have not gotten bored. Rick Rubin wanted this album to stand along with the best of Sabbath's classic stuff, and I think he delivered.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game it is so addicting! my first kindle broke so I got a replacement one and had to start the game over and I was on level 93 I think!
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Way too much error. Contradicts so much Scripture. I went into this read open minded but no more.  I would not recommend buying this book!

B0011FL7FA|5.0|I first saw it by chunks last year and thought &#34;I want it!&#34;.<br />Brilliant view of the Golden Age of Pop.
B00CU8OVIM|3.0|It's like 98 on this album. No club bangers or something you would bump in your car but it is Hip-Hop not Rap.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|Back in 1993, the Pet Shop Boys released their fifth studio album, Very.  That album was grandiose, sugary pop perfection.  However, they simultaneously released a very limited edition (no pun intended) version of that album which included a 6-track EP called Relentless.  In sharp contrast to Very, Relentless was a club-oriented affair which was experimental in a way that PSB had never been before.  Originally, the plan was to expand upon Relentless and make it a full album release, but that idea was evidently scrapped and we got Bilingual instead.  Now, 20 years later, whether intentionally or not, we got an album that could definitely be a follow-up to Relentless.  That is Electric.<br /><br />At the helm this time is none other than Stuart Price, a producer that has worked his magic on artists such as Madonna, Kylie Minogue, Scissor Sisters and Seal.  His influence on Electric is plainly obvious to anyone familiar with his style, and the music here is all the more alluring because of it.  This album plays more like a DJ set than your typical PSB album.  It's high-energy and full of swirling electronica effects, which is in very sharp contrast to last year's mellow (but brilliant) Elysium album.  However, that's not to say that the Pet Shop Boys are drowned out here.  This is still very much a PSB record.  This is most evident on the flippant \\"Love Is a Bourgeois Construct\\", which sounds like \\"Go West\\" or \\"Shameless\\" mixed with Madonna's \\"Hung Up\\" (with which it shares the same chugging bassline and drum loop).  The retro-sounding \\"Thursday\\" has a slight resemblance to \\"West End Girls\\" with the spoken lyrics, and features a cameo by British hip-hop artist Example.  \\"Axis\\", which was the first single, is brilliant as its opening track.  Mostly instrumental, the song perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the album.  But the greatest track on here is \\"Vocal\\".  The perfect closing track, it starts slow with Neil's vocals before exploding into a banging dance track that just will not let up.  It's the song you want to jump up and down to, and it fills you with joy to do so.  I would love to see this song performed live!<br /><br />One thing I really admire about this duo is that they're not afraid to change up their style.  They always come back to what made them successful, but before doing so they take risks.  Elysium and Electric are those experimental and risky records.  Who knows what they'll give us next time, but for now, this is brilliant music.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I got a lot from this book, enjoyed reading and re-reading it when the inevitable forgetting occurs.  I especially loved the info on self-publishing using CreateSpace.  Had never heard of it.  Read another book he recommended, and again, it really helped me focus on what's important in my life.  Very witty too, not preachy.
B00CELB94E|3.0|As a long-time fan of Oasis, it was obvious I was going to be interested in anything the Gallagher brothers do post-Oasis. As far as Beady Eye goes, I was pleasantly surprised at their debut album, so with this release, I was at least expecting some more of the same and hopefully a step forward. My final review of the album will be at end, but for now, here's a track by track summary:<br /><br />Flick of the Finger - Right off the bat, I think it's the best song on the album. I love the horns, the melody, lyrics, the production; everything. Liam's voice sounds great here. And the spoken passage at the end is a good fit too. To me, it's the best work Beady Eye has done yet.<br />Soul Love - A fairly simple slow-down tune with a sprinkling of keyboards and effects that give it sort of spacey feel to it, especially with the outro.  Vocals are good here too, and it's a decent song overall.<br />Face the Crowd - A faster tempo rocker with a catchy, yet maybe too repetitive, main riff. It's another decent vocal from Liam. Nothing bad with this one, but it's nothing really special as well.<br /><br />Second Bite of the Apple - A sort of trippy sounding tune, it has a little bit of everything in it, complete with a fuzz guitar effect in the chorus. Musically, the song sounds good, however it's the lyrics that I just can't warm up to. I'm not sure what they were going for here or maybe they were trying to be a little too creative lyrically, but whatever the case, most of the lyrics just sound silly to me.<br /><br />Soon Come Tomorrow - This one has a very bluesy feel to it, with the acoustic guitar starting it out and eventually leading into a whole band performance. There's a little guitar solo in the middle as well which is good. Another decent tune that just `sounds' good.<br /><br />Iz Rite - A more uplifting sound to this one. I really like the melody and the vocal harmonies, especially with the chorus. Once again, another solid song here.<br /><br />I'm Just Saying - OK, here we go. It was bound to happen. The inevitable comparison to Oasis, and here it is. There's a lot of Oasis in this song. Whether it's the rolling drums or the guitars, you can't help but recognize it. I could easily picture hearing this song as being from the Morning Glory era of the band. Overall, the song is pretty good and very catchy. Though, the lyrics at the end with the counting make me cringe a little.<br /><br />Don't Brother Me - By far the longest track on the album, its comes in right at 7:30. It's a slow, acoustically driven with some tambourine, keyboards and effects throw in. Once again, musically I like the sound and feel of the song. But it's the lyrics that are very hit and miss, mostly miss. However the biggest problem is the second half of the song. Basically, the song ends at around the 3:30, and this looped outro starts, which don't get me wrong, it sounds really good. But the problem is that instead of it being maybe a 30 second or minute fade out of the song...it goes on for 4 minutes! I'm sorry, but its just completely unnecessary. I could maybe understand it if this was the last song on the album, but its not, so I really don't get the reason in stretching the song out like that.<br /><br />Shine a Light - This one is probably my second favorite track after Flick of the Finger. I love the intro and then the song kicks in, with this awesome rhythm and guitar to it. The vocals are great, especially the backup vocals with the chorus. The song has some great sprinkling of sounds and layers to it, and again, the production is great.<br /><br />Ballroom Figured - A slow, simple, acoustic ballad that has the sound of some lost Oasis b-side. It's a fair tune, but there's really not much else going on with the song.<br /><br />Start Anew - Sort of in the same vein of the previous track, this is another slow, acoustic song, but with some more layers to it, especially the last half of the track.

It's less than 2 minutes, and reminds of \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" as far as the style goes, but no way near as good.

And for that reason, I can't really call this album any better than above average. This strength of the album for me is the production value. There's more depth, layers and textures to some of the songs and I think it sounds great overall. The musicianship is really good here too, but it's the lyrics that sometimes just aren't good to me.

0385486804|5.0|I ordered this book because it was on my summer reading list for last year. This was the first item I'd ever considered ordering from Amazon.com and I was pleased when it came a day earlier than the estimated 1st day of delivery.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I thought this was the last book. Boy was I disappointed when I read the last page but so glad there is more too come!!! Anyone hear when book #4 is being released
B005OT2YVA|3.0|Good action along the lines of Transformers movies.  The fact that the female costar was scantily dressed is simply unnecessary to making this a better film.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I will usually finish a movie even if I don't like it.  I couldn't even finish this one.  I was so disappointed in the movie.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I have been watching Game of Thrones on TV.  Love it, so I got the books to read.  I am about mid way through the set and I love it!  I have to make myself put the book down so I can get things done or go to work.  Careful....you may be addicted too!
B001ECQ4HG|4.0|4 stars as this gritty action film was most intriguing with an all star cast. The dreamers stand up to the bad guys and sparks do fly...big time. Does not pass the Suspend Disbelief Test however it is a classic testosterone movie in its own right. Arguably deserving of 5 stars for its entertainment value and star studded cast alone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is something like temple run but has much more variety.  you get to be a minion with challenges along the way, only know in order to advance, they want you make friends and play against those friends.  something I am having a problem with at the moment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The audio is just fantastic. I am reminded of my childhood, my parents read to me until I fell asleep.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Good graphics and numerous challenges. Sometimes scenes are too large for display making it harder but interesting. Good for kids of all ages.
B008XX6J4C|3.0|I enjoy this cd, It is good for some background music while preforming other tastes.  The 2nd CD is much better

B009WO7NQO|5.0|it's just fun. i enjoy playing with the little star wars guys...<br />i like it better than any other angry birds game i have.

0307957837|5.0|This was a very enjoyable series, all fast reads.  My daughter encouraged me to read these, but was horrified when I started with the second book (which seemed justifiable since we'd seen the movie together).  \\"Dad, it isn't anything like the movie!  You have to promise me to go back and read the first book!\\"<br /><br />The final book in the series was especially enjoyable, an epic battle of ghosts, ghasts, daemons, angels, ex-gods and various peoples.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|grate game to pass the time when I'm having trouble figuring out what I want to do today. amazing game
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Hate it hate it hate it! Difficult to navigate!The new app is awful! Please go back to the old format!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I heard about the book when I saw previews at the movies so I got excited about reading it before the movie came out.<br />I liked the book and the basic premise. It uses a different approach to the Zombie stories. I found it pretty entertaining at the beginning but it became somewhat repetitive in the middle and towards the end. I'd still recommend reading it.<br />One thing though, the movie is very different. It's almost as if it's two different stories that happened at the same time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Best escape game I have tried. Great puzzles, fun layouts. Please make more levels!!!! Fun for people of all ages.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Short time killer with fun puzzles. Wanting more, good way to challenge the brain for quick and easy fun. Enjoy playing it and hoping for new levels soon.

B00AOCLWF6|4.0|I'm never board watching this show! There's tons of action, it's not predictable, Noah's still hot...what more can I say!
B005HSL626|5.0|Excellent way to unwind and have an outlet to free your spirit. Recommended a good clean and wholesome. Must play.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I can't even come close to describing how funny, intense, heartbreaking, hot and GOOD this book are!<br /><br />And what made this book so great is the fact that it had a male POV through the entire book. Now, I didn't think that I would like reading a whole book with just a male point of view, but I was wrong. So, so wrong! That was what made this book so perfect, the fact that we could see how a guy thinks, act, and why he acts that way throughout the whole journey made me love him even more. And I'm shocked that the author isn't a guy, but a woman! Can you believe it? No? Me neither. It's awesome.<br /><br />Drew is an amazing character. He's spoiled, used to have things his way, used to getting everything he wants, and is one of the most honest guy's in the world. Now, you would think that those three things I mentioned first would be a completely turn-off, right? Wrong. Drew blew my mind away, simbly because he was himself throughout the entire book.<br /><br />He's a manwhore, I'm not even going to try to soften that simple fact, he just is. But he changes. God, how he changes! I'm not going to spoil anything, because while he did have his mind set on Kate the first time he saw her, he did not stop sleeping around. That's what made everything so real to me, because a guy just don't stop sleeping around just because he caught a glimpse of a beautiful girl he wants to get to know, that's not how it works.<br /><br />Kate is amazing. Everyone is amazing in this book, apparently. Haha! But I'm not kidding when I say that Kate is someone I would love to have in my life. She is engaged, yes. But she doesn't see Drew and immediately jump his bones. She whipped out her hand and showed him that she was taken, and I loved that! She's smart, pretty, funny and takes everything with a pinch of salt. She doesn't break down and cry because someone told her \\"no\\", and she works her a*s off to earn every penny.<br /><br />This wasn't just a love-story, it was an intense book where we learned a lot about the other sex. \\"Drew\\" explained things that \\"he and the guys\\" did, why they did it, and how they thought. I've never read a book like this, and I don't think I'm ever going to forget it.<br /><br />I really hope that the author will publish this book in Kate's point of view. Not because I felt that anything was missing with only Drew's POV, but because I would love to see how Kate thought about everything that went on.<br /><br />I gave this book: Five stars.<br />Would I read it again? Yes. Definitely.ory, it was an intense book where we learned a lot about the other sex. \\"Drew\\" explained things that \\"he and the guys\\" did, why they did it, and how they thought.

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Awesome game and fun format. Easy to play and keeps you coming back to play over and over. Excellent highly recommend.
B004ADB17Y|5.0|This movie is one for all ages.  It has an adventure for kids that is fun and funny.  I recommends this movie to this generation of kids and hope it is established as a classic for them also.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I have read several books by Lee Child and they have been absolutely great.<br />I would recommend his books to anyone
0812992792|5.0|This story is shaken, not stirred.  The unconventional development of the main character threw me a little off guard initially, until I picked up on the momentum and chemistry of the story telling.  I was captivated by the sardonic humor peppered here and there in the story, and the richness of the storytelling.  It is rare for me to feel so torn as to whether I felt sympathy or repulsion for the main character.  This book is really amazing, but you need to be open to riding a bit of a rollercoaster. I highly recommend it.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Great film! A must see love story, with a beautiful plot and cast. Highly recommend for a first date:). Get some!!!
B0052TDGQO|5.0|He's a great newcomer that we fell in love with watching American Idol.  Loved his concert which convinced me to buy this album and looking forward to buying more of his albums. This seller had a great price and fast delivery.
1401324649|5.0|It's hilariously funny as well as insightful. It's a crime mystery story on one level with a simultaneous humorous history of the 20th century on another. If you think that's too complicated, it's not at all. It's a very easy read. Everyone I recommended it to made the effort to call me back to tell me how much fun it was to read.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I keep trying to play with my best friend Ricky, but it dose not work on a kindle fire. It's still a great game but if your trying to connect to a person don't buy
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|My only complaint about this series is the dialogue.  My husband and I do not hear as well as we use to, and the dialogue makes it difficult to hear/understand every word/phrase said.  We get the general gist...... me more so than he does.  I have liked it better than he has.
B0094LUH4A|5.0|This is the greatest love story ever told! Redford and Streisand light up the screen and I love that I can watch it as many times as I want!
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Action, comedy, plenty of explosions and not so over the top to be stupid. Good entertainment. The sequel looks good too.
082300659X|4.0|I love this book and can't wait to be the next Michelangelo or Durer or Da Vinci. My only dish with this book is that the instructions on the exercises could have been more detailed. the pictures seem like they skip a couple steps. Definitely not for a beginner. or semi intermediate. I am going to try out the DVD and see if  that helps, will write again and describe what happens.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|Better then being at the show!  Fantastic cinematography and direction.  Highly recommend.  You can watch it over and over again and still be amazed!
0811879542|5.0|i got this book after reading the reviews of others. my daughter really likes it. She can even &#34;read&#34; it to herself - meaning she knows what to do and then turns the page to see. it's a good book for travel or for bed.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is amazing! The missions are fun and after you beat the final boss, you can go back and do the missions again. I love it.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|This fourth book is just boring. Exhaustive details about some of the least interesting characters. Curious to see what HBO does with it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|addictive and fun. you can build up without spending actual money if you are smart. gold stars will cost you tho.
B0083Z614S|5.0|My previous review of A Little Princess sums up my thoughts and appreciation of this book (18-07-2013):<br /><br />Her two most famous stories -- &#34;A Little Princess&#34; and &#34;The Secret Garden&#34;, inspired by both her poor childhood and her love for gardening......<br /><br />A quick review of previous comments on both- A little Princess and The Secret Garden indicate these two treasures were read mostly by readers in their childhood. Their insights and enjoyment expressed in reviews are difficult to improve on. This reader discovered (thanks to Kindle) these two marvelous books near the end of my sojourn as I approach my eighties. Oh, how I enjoyed these writings.<br />F.H. Burnett was both a gifted writer and wonderful story teller; a reference to her own life gives a clue of how she was  so understanding of children/ childhood, the reality of life and able to both so well as an author. She leaves the reader, especially adult ones, not only with admiration of her writing and characters but with the recognition:<br /><br />“If you look the right way, you can see that the whole world is a garden.” Indeed!
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|While parts are fun same as other games. No zoom and like others..chapter 17 no hints no bypass on Dragon puzzle I said after 2 days forget it found others took 2 months to do just that puzzle feel like threw money away since deleted game couldn't get past
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Both my spouse and I enjoy this movie very much.  So funny and fun to watch.  The singing/mashups are great and so catchy.  Excellent soundtrack.  Plus, always great to update our digital copy library.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|The recent crash of the Asiana Airlines flight into San Francisco was a page right out of Outliers! Instead of wondering how that crash could have happened, I understood it more than I would have believed possible, because of Gladwell's book.<br /><br />He covers much more than plane crashes, though--issues that touch on so many aspects of life, such as why athletes and performers achieve what they do (birth dates and number of practice hours are critical) and why being one of the older students can be so beneficial to one's success in school.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|Purchased this as soon as we could, and have watched it multiple times already.  Such a well done film and it plays great through the Amazon video service.  Wish we had subtitles but otherwise, very satisfied.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Great! Can't wait for Season 3. Wonder what will happen next. Will need to make sure I check release dates.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This is a great movie and set.  The 3D is excellent, always great to add to our digital video library.  Highly recommend it.
B00AYM6JFO|4.0|It is good, and I always like Willie.  I had just expected something different.  It is still great Willie music, just a lot different from his normal format.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is awesome! It has great characters and a great story line! I can't wait to read whats next!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|How could this series ever get cancelled?<br />How could this series ever get cancelled?<br />That's all i can say about it.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This book is highly enjoyable if you like Neil Gaiman's work--it's full of intense imagery, psychological horror, and self-realization.  What The Ocean at the End of the Lane lacks is any kind of reveal, conclusion, or wrap-up.  It is the story of a weird and traumatic episode in a young boy's life that offers up a vision of the universe as incomprehensible and dangerous but has no advice to offer, merely the shared experience of knowing that feeling out of one's depth is quintessentially human.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a very entertaining novel. I love the main character and the many people he meets as he sets out to alter the course of history. Very enjoyable read. Lots of stuff for anyone who like Stephen King
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Like he said he's not dead yet his bell still rings. As someone just a few years younger I take comfort in that
1574214276|3.0|This is a gorgeous book, truly. The authors put an amazing amount of care and intentionality into creating a book that Zentanglers will absolutely love to open and explore. The instructions for Zentangling are clear and concise, easy to follow. The index of patterns is incredibly helpful in picking and choosing favorites. And the authors offer great instruction about shading and composing Tangles.<br /><br />I feel this book is best for rank beginners, people with little artistic experience or totally new to Zentangling. I have been drawing Zentangles since my first class about six months ago, and I found this book a bit elementary. I was hoping for a book that would further advance my skills. I ended up returning this book because it didn't have enough new information to challenge me and help me grow as an artist.<br /><br />For advanced beginner and intermediate Zentanglers I recommended Beckah Krahula's \\"One Zentangle a Day\\" which I absolutely love. It challenges what I know and is helping me take my art to the next level!
0399213015|4.0|As other reviewers already had mentioned the book is small (mini), and the writing can be a little difficult to read for some people. On the other hand, you can easily carry this book in your purse and have it ready when you are out, and need to distract your child.
1439152802|4.0|Takes a while to get going.  The ending was worth the investment of time to read it through.  The second novel of hers that I've read - I'll read another.
B00CL8D83U|2.0|I was disappointed with this album. I really got my hopes up high with the track \\"Vocal\\". This song was a classic PSB song. But..the rest of the CD was a big fail for me. Every song seemed rushed and very unlike what I would expect from these guys. They have done this in the past and there is no need to worry PSB fans..they always come back with a masterpiece. Unfortunately, this one ranks as one of their worst efforts.
B00DM0XXCM|1.0|We tried. It was an interesting idea but ultimately cleaning the kitchen and going to bed was more interesting than watching this movie. It's just incredibly boring. The first 10 minutes were ok but then it just drags. Can't speak for the second half as we only had 48 hours for the rental and couldn't finish it in time. I should note that I am a sci fi nerd and watch everything, no matter how bad. Also, it's not the romance angle that bothered us; my wife loves that but she gave up before I did. It's just a very bad movie.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|As with all LEGO pieces they are extremely tiny and once built, are not \\"as fun\\" anymore. But the LEGO minecraft are an exact replica of the game and my son enjoys playing with it!
B006ZB3V2C|2.0|Graphics and sound was not as nice as I thought it should have been, but I can't complain since it was free.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is good because people may thing temple run subway surfers they are wrong please play despicable me minion rush
B007ZSBQYE|2.0|The game is actually quite difficult to navigate even on my Samsung Note II. I also used it on my Kindle Fire and I still got the same results. Will eventually uninstall.
1594487154|2.0|in reading the first half of the book, I found myself agreeing with a lot that Pink has to say. But anybody that works in Silicon Valley probably has experienced the \\"everybody is a salesperson\\" mentality firsthand. So this was perhaps stating the blindingly obvious. Still, it was an easy read, somewhat entertaining and occasionally thought-provoking.<br /><br />Where he lost me is at the end of the section on Attunement. There is a graph where \\"Grant plotted total revenue over the three months against employees' scores on the 1-to-7 scale\\" of extraversion. 25 data points beautifully aligned along a parabolic curve. Too beautifully aligned to be real statistical data. As Pink cites the source, I looked up Adam Grant's paper (available on his Wharton School of Business website) and lo and behold, the graph is there, Fig. 1: a \\"regression analysis showing a predicted curvilinear relationship between extraversion and sales revenue\\". In other words what Pink is selling as data, is actually a model. Grant is kind enough to provide the statistics for the model showing a correlation coefficient (R^2) of 0.32. For those unfamiliar with statistics, an R^2 of 1 is a perfect fit and for anything below 0.5, you need a better model. To Grant's credit, he doesn't claim that his model is good, only that it is better than the proposed alternatives. (And the statistical data in Fig. 2 really highlights how little correlation there is with the model in Fig. 1. Just the fact that the model and data are plotted in separate graphs by itself is a big red flag that the fit is poor. If the model is good, you plot it on top of the data.)<br /><br />Does Pink understand the data in Grant's paper? At the very least, passing Fig.1 off as data is sloppy. A less kind interpretation is that it's the kind of old-fashioned, information-asymmetry driven, misleading salesmanship he decries in the opening sections of the book. And yet, here he is, going against his own advice.<br />I couldn't read therest of the book. I mean, would you buy advice (or a book) from this guy?
0425264386|1.0|Unless you're writing a fantasy, the characters you create are expected to act like their real-world counterparts.  In \\"Die trying,\\" most of their actions are scripted to make Jack Reacher more heroic.  I've read a lot of crime fiction, and the best are believable -- the events described could actually have happened.<br /><br />This book is a dud.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|With time the film has become a lot less pungent and pregnant than it was when it came out. It is nothing but a fiction documentary on an essential event of the beginning of the 21st century. There was September 11, 2001 before and now there is May 2, 2011. The ten years during which terrorism seemed to be dominating the world and the USA to be running after an uncatchable ghost, will remain the ten years during which the West ran after its own tail like a deranged dog.<br /><br />And Osama Ben laden was a ghost. He had managed to be ever present everywhere and to be untraceable at all in any way imaginable. No telephone link. No Internet connection; No going out of his fortress at all. A fortress well hidden right in the middle of an urban area in Pakistan, 585 feet or so from the main Pakistani military academy, their West Point. To be unseen hide in a crowd. To be invisible hide in a fortress that stands out on its surrounding neighborhood and protect it in the most standard way so that everyone may think it is the residence of a drug lord. And it would have worked if there had not been one girl who was crazy enough to believe what her reason and deduction told her with certainty though she had no material proof of the presence of her target.<br /><br />She was a subductive mind who built a conviction from a pile of circumstantial and partial facts and subductive she had to be to subdue all the males around her in the secret service, CIA, armed forces and other agencies of the type, subdue indeed, if not abduct their rational mind for a trip onto the other side of visible reality, the invisible side of reality. To believe is at times enough.<br /><br />But the film was a very scandalous film when it came out because of the torture used to get some information. The case was abducted out of reasonable behavior and intelligence. First the only TV skimpy appearance of Obama was when he declared he would put an end to torture. All the torture took place in the film before that declaration. That's an ellipse, my dear film viewers, meaning that Obama put a stop to torture. Then the film even shows how a \\"tip\\" was in fact a trap that led a loaded car into a military base in Afghanistan and it exploded killing many, including some CIA agents who were so happy to have invited someone in the base who was going to tell them where Ben Laden was and all that with the torture of greed, for 25 million dollars. Idiotic. Money is a very good bait for suicide bombers.<br /><br />So torture did not give them a lot. And money did not give them a lot. It is only crossing and crisscrossing intelligence from many sources that led to a track, a trail, a path to the man they were looking for. Nothing replaces intelligence, and I should say a vast diversity of intelligence. Nothing is better than human intelligence, I mean intellectual work, to build a conviction from a mass of data that seems to have no logic at all. No machine could reach that conviction because a machine would work on probabilities, and let me say subduction, the truth emerging from the deeper layers of the accumulated data, is irrational, illogical, absurd in many ways. That's how Homo Sapiens invented God. Today we use it in science all the time.<br /><br />As for the unethical side of torture, it is a very bad argument. Of course it is unethical but Guantanamo will only close when the last prisoner there dies provided they don't bring any anymore. Guantanamo nevertheless worked and works very well because of the reputation it has, the myth about it and the legend about the methods used there. Of course it is unethical but with terrorists fear is the best incentive to try anything to defy that fear, to defy reason and prudence and to get caught.<br /><br />Torture is ineffective as for the intelligence it brings out but it is unluckily effective in the fear it creates in some people on the wrong side of the divide of humaneness because then they get reckless, sloppy, careless and even talkative. In fact real torture is not necessary. Just a public reputation about it is enough to reach its target. And yet real torture in inhuman and unethical.<br /><br />But once again the manhunt of the first decade of the 21st century was constructed on real intelligence obtained through intelligent collecting and not fake intelligence obtained through torture. Was torture actually used or not? Who knows really. We can trust the perversion of some intelligence gatherers for them to turn themselves into torture-masters. But these are probably the little ones on the chain, particularly if we are speaking of physical torture. And it takes a woman to know that a woman witness to a torturing session is a lot more effective on the man who is being tortured than the torture itself because the presence of a woman becomes psychological torture that is untenable for real Islamic people from the Arab or Middle-East world. To be stripped naked in front of a woman is the worst psychological and moral torture you can invent in that situation.<br /><br />Christians on the other hand are used to the quasi-naked Christ tortured to death on his cross and Jesus did not wince at the presence of his own mother and Mary Magdalena at the foot of the cross, and a third Mary, at least in the conscience of Christians who even believe Jesus presented John as being her son now, directly from the cross.<br /><br />Torture is not what you may think it is. I am just surprised this film essentially shows physical torture and body pain caused by violence. I am sure the locking up of one torture victim in a box was a lot more effective though it was not hurting the body at all. But the mind...!!!<br /><br />This film has to be seen and known as a fiction documentary on an important event of our time.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARTDEAUd even talkative. In fact real torture is not necessary. Just a public reputation about it is enough to reach its target. And yet real torture in inhuman and unethical.<br /><br />But once again the manhunt of the first decade of the 21st century was constructed on real intelligence obtained through intelligent collecting and not fake intelligence obtained through torture. Was torture actually used or not? Who knows really. We can trust the perversion of some intelligence gatherers for them to turn themselves into torture-masters. But these are probably the little ones on the chain, particularly if we are speaking of physical torture. And it takes a woman to know that a woman witness to a torturing session is a lot more effective on the man who is being tortured than the torture itself because the presence of a woman becomes psychological torture that is untenable for real Islamic people from the Arab or Middle-East world. To be stripped naked in front of a woman is the worst psychological and moral torture you can invent in that situation.<br /><br />Christians on the other hand are used to the quasi-naked Christ tortured to death on his cross and Jesus did not wince at the presence of his own mother and Mary Magdalena at the foot of the cross, and a third Mary, at least in the conscience of Christians who even believe Jesus presented John as being her son now, directly from the cross.<br /><br />Torture is not what you may think it is. I am just surprised this film essentially shows physical torture and body pain caused by violence. I am sure the locking up of one torture victim in a box was a lot more effective though it was not hurting the body at all. But the mind...!!!<br /><br />This film has to be seen and known as a fiction documentary on an important event of our time.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARTDEAU
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Love cut the rope app on my IPOD. Decided to purchase this for my son's Kindle Fire HD.  Have yet to be disappointed.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|All I can say is it has been a long time since I have enjoyed a movie so much.<br />Don't hesitate to see this one. It is well done in every way.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is a awesome game addictive and fun I would love to meet the guy who made it the end is hard to get to
B00908DDZM|5.0|This album kept popping up on my Pandora so I finally just bought it.  I love the music, it sounds really well produced.  The lyrical content is excellent.  I have enjoyed listening to this over and over.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been working out with JIllian's CD for two months and have seen a dramatic change in my energy level, body change and cloths fitting much better.  I'm addicted to the CD and feel guilty when I don't exercise with Jillian.  I sleep much better and have the energy I had years ago.  I just turned 66, 5ft.8in 130 lbs. and still in a size 10 and feel like I'm in my 40's.  A tough 20 minute workout but worth it. Years ago Jane Fonda had her DVD's, now Jillian is the queen workouts.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I had no idea who the author was, Amazon had it on sale. It was shorter than I expected (didn't see it was a novella) but the length was perfect for the subject matter. The middle of the book was good, but not great, it wasn't until the character study was in its final moments that the book truly shone. Well done.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Despite maybe a few changes from the book here and there, the movie is a faithful adaptation and I am sure will entertain any moviegoer. Though in my personal opinion, this movie should have been rated R due to the type of violence that happens in the book. Still good though.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The new format. Give me back &quot; hourly&quot; with one click. Colors are pretty but info useage is not functional.
B000JCQCW4|5.0|This movie is superbly directed and edited.  The actors give vivid and emotional portrayals of lost souls in the unforgiving world of substance abuse and dying dreams.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a good puzzle game. Not so hard that I get frustrated, but challenging enough to keep me interested.
B00BN2NY48|5.0|A fantastic collection of the best scenes from the numerous Cirque shows around the world. All set to many of the classic Beatles tunes.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I am looking for more substance in the story and don't find it yet. - therefore, I would not recommend this book.
B00DU74U74|1.0|I thought having to watch the Twilight movies was bad. This was much worst than those movies. There were just too many many moments that just didn't make sense.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game and I cant say any thing else about it it is just really sweet sweet game cool
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Entertaining book to read.  It was recommended by my 12 year old son as he had to read it for school.  I guess that means it is in the tween category like Divergent or Hunger Games.  Entertaining read with likable characters.
B005PK1G76|4.0|I thought this was going to be another one of those cheap stroller accessories but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try.  I am so glad that I did!  I use this for my citi mini double stroller and it is a perfect fit.  It is very sturdy and I love that it can actually hold a cup or bottle without it being flimsy like the other cheap parent consoles.  I gave it 4 stars because I wish it had more compartments.  Overall, I love it and wish I had found this sooner.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|This was the first Alawar game I purchased and played. Since then (about 5 months ago) I've played at least 6 others. The graphics, story lines,  and games within the game are varied and entertaining.  Keep them coming! I've become a huge fan!!!!
0385349831|4.0|The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is on my Top 20 list, as it was a very inspirational book for me as I was growing up. Another similar book was The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran that was even more impactful. In this book Paulo takes us through some similar themes of his previous books and has some new ideas. I would not rate it as Paulo's best but it is still an inspiring read. This is written more like a manuscript with ancient wisdom than a story with a message like the Alchemist so it is a book to read slowly - maybe a chapter a day as you ponder over the meaning of each.<br /><br />In style it is very similar to K Gibran's The Prophet as others have pointed out. I recommend this book as it uncovered some old ideas I had forgotten, and gave me some new things to think about - on love, on sex, on beauty, on truth, on our prejudices and on creating our own miracles.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game App. I enjoy Solitaire and this game fits the requirement. If you like simple solitaire for free this is for you.
B00130UFY2|5.0|I love all the Bourne movies and this one is no exception.  I just find the movie riveting... the right amount of action. the authenticity,<br />the locations, etc.
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|It is only the one game for free (as advertised).  So, if you are after more games; buy them. Missile Command works great.
B00005ATZT|5.0|I've been a Fugitive fan ever since the 60s, and the updated movie version certainly didn't disappoint.  Love the special audio and video affects at the beginning of the movie.  I wasn't sure anyone but David Janssen could capture the right portrayal of the Fugitive.  But Harrison Ford did a bang-up job in capturing the &#34;look &#34; in his eyes.  Tommy Lee Jones did a terrific job and I love the way the movie ended.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Installed easy and works great.  Great little calculator with big calculator features. You cannot beat the price and ease of use.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Best read in quite a while.  Can't wait to get my hands on some more OSC!  I'm hooked on books again.
159448385X|3.0|I liked this book, but did not love it.  It was nice to read about the culture and the experiences that the people have gone through (and going through).  This book is very depressing.  The characters were great, but their stories were horrible.  I'm not naïve to the horrific experiences that people are going through across the world.  I like to read more happy and light books.  There is already too many reminders of all the bad in the world.  This book wasn't for me.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|I enjoyed this album
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|I was introduced to Hawthorne just recently and wanted to listen to one of his CD's. I love the style of this native Detroiter !!<br />I've played the CD during cocktail/TGIF time and friends really enjoyed it.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Well written, superbly photographed, terrifically well enacted.  Though I dislike opera a lot, nonetheless, the music in this is wonderful.  Only downside is that you may need to have subtitles on to understand the British accents of the otherwise great actors.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Couldn't stop reading until the end the suspense and sense of danger were so great.  GAiman is writing for all of us children who hold memories of the power of imagination when we were small and felt powerless.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Gives you the basics you need to publish on Kindle. I recommend it. I used it extensively during my first Kindle launch.<br /><br />Daniel R. Murphy
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Those of us who have been anxiously awaiting a grown-up book by Neil will not be disappointed.\\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" is a quick, easy read featuring a small cast of interesting characters. While a far cry from treasures like \\"American Gods\\" or \\"Good Omens\\", I would only recommend \\"The Ocean\\" to current fans of the author since this simple story isn't as engrossing as Neil's other works.
B00417HV0U|5.0|Fabulous paddy dreams he's a beach god riding to Jesus<br />He should release more often and get Wendy back on vocals
B00CWY76CC|5.0|extremely frustrating and completely addictive!  my kids even got hooked when I asked for their help!<br />wish it would keep going to more levels
B00005RHGL|5.0|The product was excellent and even had a map of tombstone plus many other features which I didn't expect .  It was more than I expected and way better than buying a blue ray move.  I was more than happy with this product.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James goes all counterintuitive on the American belief system with clear concise explanations of why we have been led down the primrose path of unhappiness.  Spend $200k for your college education?  Nope.  Buy a house as an investment?  Don't make be laugh.  The book states the new truths that were always true but we got hoodwinked by the system that blinded us.  James gives us a great outline on how best to get it together, quit making obvious mistakes, and move forward on firm ground and be much happier for it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I LOVE Downton Abbey! It is the best show in years and with out flashing skin, vulgarity or inappropriate language.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Watching the four stars of this film, one realizes what great acting is all about.  A heartwarming story told with genuine feeling, never corny or trite.  I could watch it again & again
B003ZSJ212|5.0|If you do not already own the complete set, this is a good buy, if you have seen the movies more than once you will easily pick out the added and updated scenes, the picture is fantastic
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It keeps telling me there is an update available through the Google play store but kindle fire isn't compatible with it, the same can be said for the Facebook pages app.
B00DU74U74|2.0|I thought from the previews there would be a significant amount of action, I was very wrong, I knew it would be a teen flick but whoa did they really make it a teen flick, won't watch again
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Movie was packaged well. I brought this movie because I seen it with my daughter and I liked it so well I decided to buy it.
B000002TYX|5.0|Of course there are three sets to this Anthology, this being the first you get to hear them creating their big hits from the beginning. Having an insight into one of the premier groups that changed music forever is really incredible. You hear John and Paul go at it back and forth over how the songs should sound and when everybody would put their part into the music. John complaining that the piano wasn't loud enough, Paul commenting on the vocals, and by the time this studio cut was made they had been playing their hits over and over. Displaying the casualness for some of the hits, and then working on new material and being picky about getting it just right.  You should enjoy this CD, it's like an \\"unplugged\\" format as they work through new material.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I saw this movie and liked it so much that we bought it for our 9 year old grandson. Movie was packaged well. Excellent service.
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|Okay, I bought this at 25 bucks with 25 percent off coupon - was it worth 20 dollars - of course.  Here's the problem - I saw the docu on SHOWTIME and got re-obsessed with The Eagles.  The advertising for this says \\"4 new hours of never before seen material.\\"  Let me break this down for you: You are getting the entire 3 hour Showtime docu with NOTHING NEW. The third disc is an 8 song segment of a 77' show.  Had I known this - I would've waited for the price to come down. The docu is brilliant - but I've seen it - the \\"new 4 hours\\" are the 3 hour docu and the 1 hour concert (this could've easily went on 2 discs - and why in hell not include the entire show????)<br />BTW - the SOUND on the concert disc is SUPERB and the 8 song set they chose is a nice selection (Hotel CA, New Kid, One of these nights, Take it to the limit, Take it easy, Rocky Mountain Way, Lyin' Eyes, Tequila Sunrise)<br />but they should've included the whole show or if that WAS the show then include 2 from the era - it seems like they really skimped on extras - and where is our every 5 years or so new EAGLES show on BLU RAY that includes songs from The new CD LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN??  If you haven't seen this and don't have Showtime, this is a bargain at 20 bux.  If you've seen it but are an Eagles completest and want the concert - it is superb and the sound is virtuoso.  But it's a shame they didn't add more.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|One of those books that you want to know the ending but don't want the book to end.<br />This had me 'hooked' from the beginning.  Housework came second!!! Loved the twist at the end.
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|Ian Richardson is incomparable in this role. The plot is intense, full of twists and witty comments, so you can't stop watching. It is also political fiction concerning the Royal Family (it is easy to recognize the characters). I have also seen the first chapter of the US version with Kevin Spacey, which is also excellent, but you must give British productions the first place it deserves.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This book is well written and very thought provoking. Both humble and progressive. Need I say more? I didn't think so! ;)
B0050DIWHU|4.0|As a technical professional and recently unemployed, this book was relevant and timely. All to often I find myself gravitating towards technical references, books, blogs, magazines etc. and forget the importances of staying grounded and well rounded. We all have plans that we enact in times of good and bad fortune but we rarely approach personal and professional life as web of loosely connected  individuals who are in or at least should be in beta. Read this book from ABZ...
B005LAII80|4.0|As expected, it was violent but what I didn't expect was how artistically done it was. I bought the 3D version and I have to say, I have never been as mesmerized by the beauty that was in the ugliness. The way they did the blood and gore scenes was so artistically beautiful while absolutely disgusting me all at the same time.<br /><br />It was good, completely different animal than Judge Dredd other than the premise as judges as enforcers. I don't know if the regular version will be as awesome but if you get it in 3D, it is definitely cool.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you want monsters then you have to get this for you to get monsters you have to go on option and set it not on peaceful the there is your Minecraft
B000AJIF4E|5.0|A major upgrade from earbuds. Sound is a bit lower but with no outside noise they don't need to be any louder.<br /><br />Great with all genres of music. If ya like EDM, you will love these when the base drops.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator for every day use. Large buttons and numbers are easy to use and read. Highly recommended for everyone.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Is it an adventure story, a depiction of a tragic/heroic figure (which I was hoping for) or just another melodrama about addiction and recovery?  Okay if there is not too much to watch, but not near the top of my list.
1442474440|5.0|It is for my daughter, New book! Packed it very nice! She loves it so much!  it is so great!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|The product is satisfactory as long as you have the internet, but if you do not, you can't use it. So much for reading it on the bus.
1402773587|5.0|It is for my daughter, New book! Packed it very nice! She loves it so much!  it is so great!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My daughter and I teamed up for this game. The puzzles are clever,  but not frustrating to solve. A fun problem solving and memory game.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This movie is so entertaining. It is full of action and silly fun for fans of these actors and their old movies.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|It is not informative  -  they go real fast and you have to go back several time to catch what they are saying and doing
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Alcohol drugs and sex always sells unfortunately this is a common problem I think we would be surprised to know the extent of<br /><br />all this today great movie
B00CWY76CC|3.0|it was fine but I didn't find it very challenging and I could only play up to ten levels. but it was different and was still fun, but still only ok
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love how much feeling is put in to this book. I enjoyed reading Charlie's perspectives and comparing them to my own.<br />I would recommend this book to someone who needs some encouragement to be resilient.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was really interested in the beginning, then it took a sharp turn down. I mean really I'm supposed to believe that she was smart enough to mastermind the whole setup and yet let two hicks swindle her????? Not believable to me.  Ending was too &#34;out there.&#34; sorry.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Is a great game. My daughter is only five and she loves playing My Horse. I downloaded it for her, but now I find myself playing more than her.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I love this app. Let's be clear on that. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 out of 5 stars is because I don't like how hard it is to move around. I'm 18 and its difficult for me to maneuver while fighting and having to adjust the camera, so it must be really difficult for younger children. Other than that one gripe, I love this game and the Amazing Spider-Man franchise. I only wish Sony would let go of it so my favorite web head can join the Avangers. ;3
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So fun I love it the game is so awesome and fun dude I kid u not omg lol lol
B005OT2YVA|2.0|Michael,<br /><br />You made a number of movies in the 90's and 2000's that I loved. They are still movies I like to watch when they come on TV. Pearl Harbor introduced me to Kate Beckinsale and I thank you for that. However it is now time for you to either learn a completely different formula for filming a movie or else stop directing altogether. No more slo-mo shots. No more shots from the ground looking up at the hero as he surveys the chaos around him in a critical moment where everything seems almost lost. No more 'unnecessary to the plot' love stories with gratuitous shots of the scantily clad female love interest. It's all so dated now and that is no longer working. Your best work in the past few years was that short you did on South Park - I loved that and watch that regularly so please do more of that.<br /><br />The only awesome thing about this movie: Optimus Prime! Peter Cullen is perfect as always as the voice of Optimus. He is to Optimus what Kevin Conroy is to Batman: the one and only true voice of the character.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|it is a very good watch,it seems very nice in my hand ad sure it is a valueable brand<br /><br />i'm realy like it
B00821OX98|3.0|I avoided this show for the first few years because I just didn't buy Noah as the 'scholarly-dad action-hero moral-compass-of-the-show' star and because I dislike the whole &#34;Lost&#34;-style 'you learn it as they learn it' storytelling angle. I prefer Star Trek and Star Wars style where you see the story from both sides. Show me the aliens!<br /><br />Anyway, I started streaming it when Amazon told me it was free with my Prime membership and I have to say I am liking it more than I thought I would! It's a fairly realistic portrayal (IMHO) of how people would likely react in such a situation. Looking forward to watching the other seasons now and hope they live up to the promise shown in this one.<br /><br />My one huge complaint is directed more at the TV industry: I really dislike these little 10-12 episode &#34;seasons&#34; that allow the actors the freedom to pursue their other loves. A season is 22-24 episodes. It's called a job. You work on it about 48 weeks a year. Why do these shows with mini-seasons have sketchy ratings or have trouble keeping their fanbase? Hmm, maybe because you are off the air for 80% of the year? I've fallen in love with so many of these mini-season shows (Fairly Legal, In Plain Sight, etc.) with great characters and writing and have a hard time remembering them 42 weeks later when they come back on.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this g ame i love taking care of horses it makes me feel as if i have my own horse
B00BYISQTO|5.0|It is their first album that made me wow.  It gives such a great sense of being rewarded for listening all the way through.  Every album they wrote to date was great but it is this album that they went from great to utterly amazing art rock.<br />It is an album that begins eloquently with \\"I should live in salt\\". It leads the listener into the album like a story teller setting the stage for something amazing.  It's melancholy attitude is infectious.  The album continues onto Demons a highly self aware and self reflective marvel.  Beginning haphazard but with and increase sense of structure.  The texture brought about by reverb is the lead into a chorus led by violins that pull you further into the depths of the album.<br />The album reaches its most energetic stance with \\"sea of love\\". It is the quintessential national song but much more evolved than their earlier work.  Even in their most powerful of riffs shows the lyricists frustration with dealing with reality and the empathy that comes with it.<br />The song that brought me in the most is \\"Heavenfaced\\".  If I understand it right it is about the the struggle between faith and doubt.  The loved ones you want to keep around for your life.  But I could be wrong but that is something I can relate to.  The struggle between uncertainty whether religious or other.  Trying to maintain the ones you love but eventually having to let go.  The finality of life I suppose.<br />This album is not about its climax but its exit.  It leads you through one sorrowful, self abuse, guilt-ful response from wealth to the singers continued frustration with how we deal with the concept of the after life. \\"Humilation\\" is the beginning of its conclusion. \\"Pink Rabbits\\" and \\"Hard to Find\\" has this feeling of being set out to drift.  It is the appropriate inconclusive conclusion.  For an album that discusses religion so much the end leaves you hoping for something more.  Not sure what though.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is a really cool game! Its fun and addictive. But sometimes the game deletes things.  For example when the Easter edition was out, I collected most of the eggs and the game deleted them all. Made me very upset. Also just recently it deleted all of the keys I had collected. What's up with that?
B00DUCXFUC|1.0|Well, the much hyped Ultimate Collector's Edition would still be worthwhile had they at least given us new masters for the first two films. But no. Instead, they chose to add in some fancy cards and worthless toys to the existing releases, giving the whole packaging a new name pricing it high. If you don't own the films already, get the previous release- The Dark Knight Trilogy at a fraction of this new set's price and stay well away from this lame release.
B0019TYQ38|5.0|Emma Thompson wrote  a first-rate screenplay and the cinematography is wonderful.  Great cast to go along with a great classic.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a great show with interesting characters and is fun to watch. The pilot should tell you if it's for you or not.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever  I can spend 1 day on this app my friend showed this game now I  play it all day I love this game
B009NY43NY|5.0|Awesome! That's all I can say. I love this series so much and yes, I am happy with the ending!
B008532S54|5.0|If you have ever been involved in communal living or the new age movement, you will likely recognize yourself somewhere in this film. My husband and I laughed til we cried from start to finish. We don't take ourselves too seriously. If you're a hippie or new ager that does, you may not laugh, but you will certainly see yourself mirrored in some of the caricatured roles. Fun!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I enjoy the maps and the whole app responds quickly.  User friendly so its easy to add cities where friends and family live.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book was good I was a little disappointed that it took me so long to really enjoy it, great way to show how mental illness affects the individual and the people around them.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Incredible album.  I'm a huge QOTSA fan and this is probably my favorite album yet.  Do yourself a favor and buy this album.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|This is a movie my wife and I love to watch.  My wife loves classics (loves TCM) and who doesn't love Cary Grant.  The quality in HD is excellent. Well done Amazon!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love it even when I should be working I am playing this game. Fun and relaxing.<br />You will not be sorry
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|too touchy and I hats the victor battles it is just awful do not buy it I hats hats hats itl
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|It has finally ended and feel somewhat of a loss in remembering Mr Jordan's passing. The world of 'Wheel of Time' has really ended. It was a good ending too bad it couldn't have been a new beginning. Nor Brian get back to Way of Kings world.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show is completely out of my comfort zone of television but I cannot stop watching it. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Great show!
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I am a recent devotee to Train and just can't get enough of their music.  If you like great music and great song writing look no further.  I am simply blown away by the lyrics.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Great CD all songs are fantastic!<br /><br />Check out &#34;Miss You&#34; and &#34;Lost in You&#34; gotta be #1 hits!<br /><br />If you like Darius, this is a must.
0060594896|5.0|I had already read it. Bought a copy for a friend because I was brain washed into doing so by the audio book. Kidding, that's only half true. Now seriously it is a great book to focus you on how to achieve the things you want in life. It is what it says &#34;How to get from where you are to where you want&#34; It is packed full of principles that you can pick and choose to find what works best for you.
B007704PRU|5.0|I've been completely swept away by this trilogy - you have to read all three.  The last one left me satisfied but wanting to know what happens next!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice nice nice it it it is is yes yes I like it good game to play when you wantonly a game
B002KKCVX2|5.0|Loved them the very first time I put them on.  They did need to be adjusted slightly to get them comfortable on my feet but after that they were felt great.  The comments from previous reviewers about one sandal being smaller than the other was due to one of the sandal straps being tighter than the other (in my opinion), the sandal themselves were both the exact same size.  Walked around Hershey Park in them and wore them to the water park as well and they felt great at the end of a long day.  I would recommend these sandals to anyone looking for a well constructed sandal that can handle various conditions.
B005CRQ2IU|3.0|It's not my kind of reading, but it was mildly intriguing.  I was kept engaged, for the most part, but overall it was a rather dull experience.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|What's not to love about it? Ricardo Montelbahn  as Khan was a good choice in the Star Trek series, and needless to say was the only logical choice for The Wrath Of Khan. The one puzzling part of the movie was &#34; Okay, how did Khan and his crew figure out that there was a Federation ship code used to disable their vessel ? &#34; Come on guys, Checkov and his captain had been left in the facility at Regula 4, and I don't think there was a user guide manual laying around. I did find myself with tears in my eyes at the death of Spock. That particular scene does it to me every time I watch it.
B00C061I3K|5.0|New Daft Punk album. Best new release of 2013. Daft Punk is a great listen and this one spins a jazz style beat on all of the songs. Get Lucky is the song of the summer but my favorite is track 13, Contact. The way the beat keeps building up to a peek and drops at the right time is just amazing.
B000HZHBIM|4.0|Being one of a sufficient age, and having watched the entire original Star Trek series, I have therefore given this movie a 4 star rating. It possibly could have earned a 5 if the machine fly over had been a little shorter, and if the plasma ball that hit the Enterprise at first contact with the cloud had been a different color than the ones that took out the Klingon ships. I mean, REALLY, the Enterprise should not have been able to withstand that hit. Other than those two items, the actors chosen for the supporting characters were right on the money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Who ever created this app was a complete genius!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE this app!!!!! I just wish I could have all the horses!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I have mixed feelings about the interview style narrative.  You can cover broader ground, but poor depth with both the characters and story is the challenge.  Still, the book is good in part for its unusual approach.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This processor definitely does what I was looking for.  While it isn't the newest out there it certainly is a fast and reliable processor.  I have been a fan of AMD processors for quite some time and if doing a build prefer AMD, unless I'm asked to use Intel.  This processor does what I need it to do and works really well in the Asus M5A78L-M LX Plus board.  It's certainly faster then the HP computer I was using that I upgraded since it was given to me, at that time it was easier to upgrade the hard drive and memory.  If you need to keep costs down and still want some decent speed this is the processor to go with.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|And i'm so gone with this book that nothing around me existed i'm so tied up with these characters that i was so mad about how long i have to wait for the next book HOT!!!!!!!!!!!
0764169742|5.0|As a beginner in colored pencil drawing, I like this book. It provide useful information and techniques, and beautiful presentations of the author's drawings (as well as some others')
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's everything I was hoping for and more. It does not lag or gives me any trouble to use. It works great on my kindle Fire.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Good match game, needs a better explanation of what some of the power-ups/bonuses do. I have no clue as to what one of them does. Other than that I enjoy it, good time waster. Grandbaby enjoys watching.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I like it but when I play kung fu scrat I spend 5 acorns and it gives me 1 I Hate that I really do but I really love this game
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|A great album by a bunch of hard working young people who have taken the music industry by storm with their great lyrics and awesome instrument playing & tremendous vocalist! I own all their cds now.
0761169253|4.0|Austin Kleon's original blog, Steal Like an Artist, which was freely available on the internet until recently, was one of the greatest presentations on being creative I've ever read. Kleon's book of the same name, this book, is merely a pretty good expansion of said blog. All the original content seems to be there though plenty of filler has been added presumably to justify a book publication.<br /><br />The book is organized around 10 points of wisdom--all of which are inspired. My favorites are #1 - Steal Like an Artist, #5 - Side Projects and Hobbies are Important, #9 - Be Boring and #10 - Creativity is Subtraction.
B000063147|5.0|Great piece of work by a bunch of hard working young people with unbelievable writing and musical skills! I now own all their albums!
B005LPEILQ|4.0|The Bone Sword by Walter Rhein follows Malik, a disgraced/runaway Camden's Guard (an elite military unit) and Noah and Jasmine, two kids one of which has the amazing power to heal.  The character progression is a very strong point of this book.  As Noah and Jasmine have no practical experience they show a lot of growth as they travel and learn.  Malik, being an established warrior, has his history revealed through his memories and stories.<br /><br />Father Ivory plays as a truly horrific villain.  His lust for power and inability to deal with anything that he vaguely sees as a challenge to his authority combined with the fact that he is losing his mind make for a scary figure.<br /><br />Overall the story had a good flow keeping me involved.  There were some plot elements that were pretty familiar, including what could have been a kind of big reveal toward the end of the book.  If you are a fan of traditional fantasy novels, especially ones that have lots of hand to hand combat this could be a good book for you.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Purchased this for my son and daughter in law who were having some challenges in their marriage.  This book helped put some things into perspective.
B001V9LRV0|3.0|One additional disc w/ some great bands --- but it appears I'm paying for packaging instead of content ------ would forego extra packaging for more of the concert if it was availiable------
B00005JMXX|5.0|When watching a movie gives you cold chills, it must be good. Special effects are so realistic, that even knowing which were computer generated, it was still hard to tell the difference.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I have to say that I loved this story.  The futuristic view is one all to real of a possibility.  I enjoyed the interplay of corporate  greed along with the grunters individuality that leads to friendship.  This was definitely a page turner that was hard to put down. Being a child of the 80's myself I truly enjoyed the trip down memory lane, between the games, music and old tech references (I too have fond memories of our Commodore 64) it is worth the time to enjoy.
B00005JA8B|5.0|Still as good as I remember it. thought it would seem old, but it was a timeless classic. I'm glad I bought it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can honestly say that I have read over 170 books this year and HOPELESS is my favorite.  It is a pretty deep story that is both beautiful...filled with unconditional love and friendship....but it is also heartbreaking...filled with pain and loss that will undoubtedly leave you needing a box of tissues.  This book is beautifully written and  the characters are amazing.  I get annoyed with companion novels sometimes but I will most definitely be purchasing LOSING HOPE asap even though it cost more than I usually like to spend on  book.  I Need to hear Holders side of the story because of the pain and heartbreak he went through over the years.  Purchase this book....you will regret it if you don't.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I stuffed this pint-sized chimney starter to the brim and hoped as I poured lit charcoals into my Weber 18 inch grill.  Well, that one load kept good heat for 2 hours and some, cooking 2 pork roasts, 3 pounders each, 6 chicken leg quarters, 4 top sirloin 2 inch square steaks, two lamb chops, and finished with 4  leg quarters to use up the extra heat.  I was surprised and very content.  That domed insert that positions the charcoal really works.  Those other chimneys with the flat insert take a good 40% longer with unburnt charcoals.  It's a whole lot cheaper than its European clone as well.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This was great and new information to me. My personal doctor also agreed with the info. This was money well spent!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Our book all agreed that this book was amazing. The end was completely surprising, which isn't always true in a mystery. We all felt the conflicting emotions that a parent may feel if they were in such a difficult situation. I recommended it to several looking for summer reads.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I was enthralled from page 1. Did not want to put the book down. The only disappointing part is that the book ended way to soon for me.
B00005V1Y0|4.0|I really enjoy ballroom dancing.  They can be a little over the top in their costumes but there is great beauty in their movement
B005EHQGTS|5.0|The only issue I have is not being able to move the pointer to the left to display the unity launcher.  Other than that, it works like a charm.
1594136467|4.0|As the account came from a scientist -the experience of the author seemed largely authentic. However his meeting with the dead sister is unconvincing as there were many of his dead relatives who must have loved him equally -their absence is not explained.<br />I am a Hindu who believes in afterlife and rebirth so it was easy for me to like the book. I would certainly recommend it to my friends and relatives.
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|It's nice to have the option of accessing the files on my tablet from my computer without a wire.  I haven't used it extensively yet though.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great! Wating for c-11. If you need help on level 7 go to utube can you escape and it will help you out.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|But I don't think I'm going to be using it.  I'll stick with Task Free.  I like the widget better.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love Pinterest, love the app, but it tends to shut down when I enter pins pretty much like 7-8 times a day... SO frustrating.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Good story and will try to follow the series.  I had almost forgotten to look into it but I sure will.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is the  best game I ever played. It is the most  fun  game in the univioriors. I love minion  rush.
B004UID2LC|3.0|works great for what it is. my main problem with it was that it took forever to download anything. course that is just my old service
B007SGM084|5.0|The third book gets a little boring and repetitive, but I love the series!!! It's a lot more than just &#34;reading porn&#34; as everyone says. I especially enjoyed the allusions and references, along with all the diction that is unique to the Fifty Shades Trilogy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game... the great fun of temple run with the lovely characters from Despicable me!!! Bananaaaaass!! Love it! Great game I say get it! Just the noises are fun! :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|What a great way to keep your mind flexible.  I live in a senior community and we're all trying to keep our mental faculties and thinking games are a great way to do that.
B008602KQI|5.0|It was a great movie and I like watching it over and over again. I would recommend it to anyone who has not seen it already.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|spellbinding-we loved this movie-the actors were excellant-I'm required to write a certain number of words-this is really strange-the end period
B00BHMETKC|2.0|I kept waiting for something crazy to happen.  It was one of those movies that just strings you along to the end, and when it ends, all you can say is...  thats it!
140006922X|1.0|Your second paragraph says that Reza Aslan is not debunking Jesus Christ.  That statement is incorrect.  He is debunking Jesus Christ, the Christianity he is proclaiming is not Jesus the Christ, but Jesus the man.  Just sayin...
B00785P2QC|3.0|good game. don't like that you have to wait for so long to get somewhere unless you want to spend real money.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Glad I could watch it on prime. Looking forward to more if similar content. Forcing one to write a certain number if words makes reviews time consuming hence they r not often dine
1572814349|5.0|Very concise pack that reads beautifully. Best picture choices for current age. The magician St Francis of Assisi. Awesome assistance.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|love magic. have many many cards. will continue to play both on line and with my friends. bate writing reviews. they never seem to end.
B00BQHA06A|4.0|My favourite snake finally makes an apperance with a wish in his heart and a smile on his face. Nice to see you.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Never in my life have I ever played a game like this before. It crazy to think while playing this game that shit like this could actually really happen. It's scary and intriguing at the same time, but I do like the game though and cannot wait to see what other game you all come up with next.
B009AP2G26|5.0|SO terribily distraught with the passing of Cory Monteith. Season 4 is my favorite! I cant stop watching. So sad.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Just love this Christmas cd and Rod does them all so well. I've always been a big fan of his.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I CAN NOT PULL UP WHAT MY FRIENDS HAVE WRITTEN.  I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL THINGS, JUST CAN NOT GET TO THIS PART
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This app is great because it helps kids and adults understand what zoos are needed for. Zoos help endangered species, then they return them back to the wild. Also this app is really fun to play.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|The best story of life and death. Made me cry. I think everyone should read this book at some point in their life's.
B00123IATW|5.0|This album has brings a lot to the table. The lead track, \\"Yours is No Disgrace\\" is a shining example of what this album has in store for you. It features a soaring opening that lays down the ground work and then becomes a slow, moody piece before launching back into its soaring reprise. This is a trend that continues throughout the album.<br /><br />  The flow of the tracks is a truly striking feature about the album. Every track flows well into the next. This is also true of the movements that comprise each track. The pieces build on each other, or present a shift in tone which strengthens the individual pieces. Timing is also handled very well on this album. Once the mood is set, or the particular movement has done its part, the band shifts into another tempo/key signature/time signature to keep the song moving. I was never bored during this album because so much is always going on (in a good way).<br /><br />  Lastly, the musicianship of each member of the band is well displayed. Jon Anderson's vocals are truly unique and  lend an ethereal feel to each track. The vocal harmonies are also extremely tight. I daresay that not since the Beatles or Beach Boys have I heard such tight harmonies in rock songs.The drums, and especially the bass, feel like lead instruments at times and then move to the back which provides an interesting listening experience. The keyboards/piano are accents to the song with some masterfully controlled frills, but no instrument ever seems to be trampling or towering over the others. A big testament to musical talent.<br /><br />Rating 5/5 -<br />Best Songs: All of them<br />Worst Songs: None (seriously, there is not even an average track)
1781162646|5.0|Joyland is classic Stephen King!  Great suspense, well drawn, believable characters.  I hated when I got to the end, because I wanted the story to go on.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A quality show...well done in all aspects: acting, plot, scenery...thoroughly entertaining, and a realistic view of the period.<br />6 thumbs up!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|i dont like this since they changed it. the temp for my city is wrong alot of the time. i just removed it from my tablet because its not accurate. its 91 here and this app says its 85 . i dont like the new setup.
B004478AS4|3.0|I liked it, it was ok I liked how it had the African languages in it I would recommend this book. It was ok nothing much to say about it.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|It has a good grip on the movie story line however the graphics could use some work. It is a good game even if the graphics need some work.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Love everything about Walking Dead,  My son loves the extras(which i only show him) since it explains how normal people are turned into &#34;walkers&#34;
B0094M0DJS|5.0|It's not a science fiction, it's a movie about urban combat and it is awesome!  I honestly think the were looking for a way to make a movie about what it is like to be a soldier in Iraq but avoid any political entanglements.  I was deployed to Iraq with the 27th Eng cbt abn and this movie nails it for me.
B008V0OLOW|5.0|I first heard this set of recordings on a long distance flight and decided then a copy had to be bought. The basic Glad Rag Doll is pretty good, but the extra tracks on the Deluxe Edition raises its level. A well-merited 5 stars.
B008M721MS|5.0|It's cool I like it because I can video chat with my friends u should get it.<br />Epicepicepicepicepic epic epic epic epic epic
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|GREAT SELLERS PACKAGE VERY VERY WELL AND RECEIVED VERY QUICKLY. SON IS ENJOYING THE MOVIE SO MUCH HAS WATCHED IT SEVERAL TIMES. WILL MAKE A GREAT BIRTHDAY GIFT SO TH YOUNGUNS!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a good game to play. I bet that even the parents would want to play it also. Very good.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Great story - captures the magic and horrors of childhood with exquisite detail. Made me remember my own childhood imagination (and how rich it was) and wonder and contemplate what my own children may be imagining. A must read for every Gaiman fan.
B0063IH60K|4.0|If you need some basic brain stimulation while in the &#34;library&#34; you can't beat the price!  I like the left handed option too....
B00890JFMW|5.0|Vangelis has written an incredible amount of music and movie scores. There is just no way to capture all of them in one set. This collection does a great job of capturing many of the best. There are several haunting and unforgettable pieces from Bladerunner. The Conquest of Paradise them song and of course the matchless Chariots of Fire title. If you like Vangelis I do not think you will be disappointed with this 2 CD set.
B0043U98RY|1.0|This show came highly recommended by friends, however I can find nothing good to say about it. Poorly written abysmal acting, just mind numbing, skull crushing drivel... Sorry!
B001QB5S3G|5.0|Unbelievable in terms of the realism and the cinematography!  The music is absolutely beautiful and many scenes brought me to tears and gave me a deeper appreciation for my faith!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My wife and I love this movie and we decided to watch it with our 4-year old twin girls at home before possibly taking them to see their first movie in a theater (Despicable Me 2). It was really enjoyable and the girls loved it. The minions were favorites of both girls and the &#34;scary parts&#34; were few & far between (our girls are very susceptible to scary parts as they don't watch a lot of TV and what they do watch is very neutral such as Dora, Busy Town, etc). I definitely recommend this for younger kids and there were several laugh out load moments for my wife and I. Looking forward to the sequel.
B0055MBQOM|4.0|There is nothing worse than a badly coloured screen. This is super easy to use, and very compact too, for those interested in size. It does the job quick and easy, and makes the process simple. Glad to have it on hand. Made a difference in my monitor and now I know that what I edit in my photos is accurate. Love the fact I can use it on more than one computer too.
B00B81B0HC|3.0|Several great hits, and a few good songs. Overall, a nice blend of music. Worth the $ for mp3 download.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|What a wonderful story by such a young author.  I've read a lot of WWII books and this one compares favorably with most of them. The whole narrative is centered around one incredible incident in which a German fighter pilot takes pity on a severely crippled US bomber and can't bring himself to finish it off.  Makos did a great job setting everything up with backgrounds on both pilots leading in to the climactic encounter.  My favorite part may have been their emotional reunion forty years later as old men.  This book would be a great read even if you had little or no interest in the war itself.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was so happy to have this available.  I can't wait for the next season to start!!!!!  I am waiting to savor the last episode!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|With characters played by real bikers on several episodes and the talent of Kurt Sutter and the regular cast of the show this is one the best biker soaps to date!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love the mystery of why this man is so disturbed, yet longing for something more. I think that this book pulls at every emotion a woman can have and is definitely something I would recommend to all my girlfriends. You feel so naughty reading it, yet you don't because there is something much deeper than sex underlying in every page. I am buying the second book now!
B00APAENUI|3.0|If you like the Honor Harrington series than you will like this book. However, it was a bit slow at times and the space battles were almost an after thought.
B0059DQDR2|3.0|Good effort but the film lacks continuity with it switching from one story to another. Good acting and good script.
B0095ZQ36G|3.0|Contains interesting research into the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) which lost more men (33 per cent) than he German army (30 percent) in the war, and took much of the blame among the German people  for &#34;losing the war&#34;.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game makes you use your brain. it is also a good game if you need to waste some time.
B00CDUVDEC|1.0|I'm a huge Pantera Fan. I listen to them everyday. I saw them in concert on The Far Beyond Driven Tour. It's the best show I have ever seen!! I bought this cd the first day it came out ( yes I still buy CDs ) expecting to hear kick A## Phil Anselmo. Instead I hear Phil not singing like Phil!! Its like he totally changed his style!! In Down and SuperJoint u can tell who is on vocals!! I listned to like 3 songs of this cd and I couldn't take anymore!! I had to turn it off!! I'm not a fan of the solo project.
B009QW7YEI|3.0|I always thought Pierce Brosnan made a good Bond.  The villian is about as hokey as you can imagine but the car chases and gadgets in this film are entertaining.  Having Teri Hatcher in the film doesn't hurt either!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Completely different than anything I've read before! Very innocent, I would so hate to hear the other side of the story
B00DHNAQ2Y|2.0|I was thinking of Evil Dead II when I rented this, and was hopeful for another great Bruce Campbell journey, but alas it was not what I had in mind.  If you're into plain horror movies you'll enjoy this.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Great job on choice of songs. Looking forward to many more from our American Idol winner. Keep up the good work..
1616551631|5.0|While I loved all the designs and concepts from the game, I did not like the actual game as much. It was a very beautiful game and I enjoyed all the environments and designs, so I had to get this art book. This book is pretty much a summary of the entire game, so this is pretty much all I wanted.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|You get what you expect, no surprises. The story is not deep. There are some lingering questions as to why the story takes the direction it takes. The fun and entertainment factor are high nonetheless.
0399162097|5.0|Unusual situation with deep human story told with warmth and wit.  My first  book from this author. I will now find some more of her books to enjoy.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Alice Munro is unquestionably my favorite author. Her short stories, in this and other books, are jewels. I can read her stories over and over, and each time I take something more and find a deeper, richer insight. This collection also has a few stories at the end that are autobiographical, which is a gift for Munro's readers because she has said she will not write any more. I think she deserves to retire if she wants to--she's given us such a wealth of stories to read and reread.<br /><br />Most of her stories take place in her country, Canada, often in small towns in the countryside or Toronto or Vancouver. The stories pull you in, sometimes you're not even sure who's telling the story at first or if you should like them. Sometimes the stories change point of view, but never feel contrived. In one story a young marriage breaks up (and we see it from the wife's point of view) and decades later the husband (his point of view now) revisits the wife's best friend at the time of the breakup. There is a dreamy quality to this tale; the man is elderly and has a much younger wife now, but he seems to feel a need to clear up something from the past. Then we learn that he could have looked up his ex-wife in his travels, but didn't choose to, instead dropping in on her friend. Such mystery and so many clues are available in these stories, but things aren't ever spelled out. Munro is a genius at getting us to think about and delve into the characters she creates.<br /><br />I would recommend this book and anything by Alice Munro wholeheartedly, without question.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|This is another roller coaster ride-- a book you can't put down. The ideas that are presented in the book are plausible, scary, and exciting at the same time. The characters are somewhat predictable, but still hold true to Mr. Rollins' previous novels. I definitely recommend this book.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Bought the app a couple years ago and worked great but now it says I don't own it yet I don't even have an option to purchase it again.  Quality...
B005COO1X6|5.0|True Stephen King fashion!! This was a great little creepy read, Mr. King always does fine work in regards to his short stories, and this one does not disappoint. Perfect for while waiting at doctors office or at the airport.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved it. I would highly recommend that if you haven't seen it, do before the new season begins. Do it!
B00D3ZJB1S|5.0|I purchased this because Ozzy was back and I wanted to ( hopefully ) be surprised in a good way.<br />I am actually more surprised at how &#34;retro&#34; this album really sounds.<br />Seriously it sounds like it was made in the late 70's more than would have imagined and, if you are an Ozzy fan more than a Black Sabbath fan I think you'll be a bit let down by this record.<br />If you like Sabbath though I believe the 4 &#34;extra&#34; songs are well worth it as 2 of them are better than most of the rest of the album.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved it. I would highly recommend that if you haven't seen it, do before the new season begins. Do it!
B0000VCZKW|5.0|THis is a heart warming movie that could be called a comedy and fantasy rolled into one package. another movie that is a must have for your collection.
B0012GMVDK|5.0|Cohen is one of the best songwriter /poets of this generation. The Future is gritty, funny, and somber all rolled into one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed this one! Kept my interest to keep playing.<br /> Just the right amount of challenge. Wanted more when it was over.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked this one. Kept me thinking and trying to get to next floor faster each time. Fun to play and fit for many skill levels. Hope they create more.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|This is a well written story, but it should be noted that the age group this appeals to, and the characters ages are young teens. It is simply written. Character development is slow and predictable. The specialness of the main character is over the top. He is constantly finding rare companions and animals, and doing un-doable deeds.<br /><br />To put this on par with George Martin and Tolkien is laughable.<br /><br />It is a good introduction to fantasy reading for children.
B00BMQTY3U|5.0|WOOOOOOOW!!!!!!!  My ears applaud Charles Dudley. This is what GREAT music is. Charles Dudley, your music touched my soul. This music should be played on every radio on the planet.  I am a music addict and Charles Dudley is my my new fix..<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />T- Bone
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I was not thrilled with the premise of a bunch of kids being thrown into an arena to kill each other, especially since the young adult genre is considered to be for ages 12 and up, but people kept recommending it, so I read it. The first half of the book was all right. I liked the main character, Katniss, she was a survivor, strong and focused. The huge gap between rich and poor and the government controlling its people through fear was also intriguing in this futuristic world. Then about half way through, the book turns into some wishy washy story of confused teenage love in the middle of a fight for survival, which had me rolling my eyes and a little annoyed because it overshadowed some very disturbing subject matter and belittled the gravity of the situation, like, 'Oh, Hey, people are being slaughtered all around me and I'm killing them too, but OMG am I in love with this boy or the one back home?' I gave it three stars because it kept me reading and I'll likely pick up the next book to see if the people finally rise up and revolt against the government.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book, wonderful series. I have been amazed by how much I have enjoyed these books. I know many have not liked the ending, but I liked it. I found it comfortably sad.
B000FC130E|4.0|Imaginative and entertaining. Has two of the most charmingly repugnant villains that I've ever come across in a fantasy book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Much smarter than 100 floors! I have spent quite some time playing this and it does not get repeatitive. Great game!
B0010SKUYM|3.0|Great world-building, complex magic system, beautiful writing at times, and intriguing story, but eh... the characters fell short for me after Kvothe made it into the magic college. For some reason it reminded me of the first time I saw Titanic. For the life of me, I could not understand why every woman seemed to think Jack was the hottest boy to ever sail the seven seas. And the same goes for Kvothe.
0385344333|1.0|As a huge Jack Reacher / Lee Child fan, this one was a complete DUD !!<br />Book has lots of meaningless fill and moves quite slow.<br />Pick a different Lee Child book - my advice.
B004GJXQ20|2.0|Could not finish this book. I got 75% through and realized that I didn't like any of the characters and didn't care if they lived or died.  The author didn't seem to care, so why should I?
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Great movie for us die hard fans!  Wonderful addition to my library.  I can wait until the new Trek comes out so I can purchase that one too.
B003K15IF8|5.0|Rightfully, it should become a classic. A novel that builds an unforgettable character, so clearly self defined that even through his wretched experiences, his self knowledge makes his choices seem redemptive.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome!!! i play it oj the bus with my friends and they play it i got my whole family playing it and that means brothers mom dad cousins aunts and ungles godsisters and godmother and godfather too bad dogs dont have tumbs lol
0061733199|3.0|If you're British you'll appreciate this book more than the average American. John Wiseman is British, and as such, he uses a decent number of British terms that need translation into the U.S. counterpart. Admittedly, I had high hopes upon receiving this book (after seeing the quite-favorable Amazon ratings) and perusing its pages; however, it ended in some disappointment. Grammatical errors and are scattered throughout, in addition to the British jargon. This book could also be enhanced by improving the illustrations or--even better--using quality photographs. In survival situations quality information is very important, for obvious reasons. This important information can be conveyed through illustrations; that is good. However, I would prefer to identify an edible plant, for example, using a quality PHOTOGRAPH instead of an artist's rendition, which is all this book contains. In addition, I felt SOME of the explanations given could have been more accurate or at least more thorough. They tended to leave me feeling lost rather than enlightened and in a position to act correctly.<br /><br />That being said, there is certainly little doubt that the information this book does contain is valuable. You are better off reading this than not, so don't get me wrong. I would still recommend this simply because of the number of favorable ratings in comparison to similar books available. If my suggestions above were addressed this book would be a 5-star quality work. Cross your fingers for a future edition ...
B009LDCXNY|4.0|I am seventeen years old and am getting the 8th season on dvd for my eighteenth birthday, i have to admit the show has gotten a little weird, but that is what I love about it, and why it is my favorite show!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Easy read, kept your attention, just the right amount of romance, Would definitely recommend to the reader looking for a good love story to read. i will look for other books by Lyn Kelly to read.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|It's a book by John Green, it's emotionally damaging yet enlightening and witty charming characters make it a lovely read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|More fun than those 100 floors-type games, and challenging without being so frustrating that you don't want to play anymore.  Wish it had more rooms.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This mahjong game is the best . It help me to relax and to stay focus. It's also good for traveling. A must have.
B0001Z53F6|1.0|This is a re-mix.  I do not like it.  Even though Pete Townsend re-mixed it, I do not like it.
B009PMB3CI|5.0|This game is cute my brother loves it and so do I at first when I got it I thought it would be boring but after a while it's fun!
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Sound is great.. This is about the best album Pink Floyd recorded.  Sounds come from all around the listening area.

B004KKXMSI|5.0|Love the look of these three films on blu-ray disc and the sound is amazing! Viewed best on HD television making it almost like being there!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's like a child vision of subway surfer. But it's really hard to get to a know palace those .
B006RK9EK4|3.0|It's labeled as good condition.<br /><br />It looks clean but the book is really worn. Nice read though. Next time, will check with the seller on the book condition.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Archer's five part series, The Clifton Chronicles is spelling bounding! Best Kept Secret is the third book. Historical, family intrigue, love, devastation!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|a great and simple game innocent enough for all ages. Our three year old can navigate this game and we parants can join in the fun.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I only very recently became addicted to this game. The game is fun and you can move us fast by making neighboors with other community members. I especially like that I don't have to link it to my Facebook to have friends on here. That being said the app has glitches and needs work. Pretty often a small screen will say that it's not responding and asks you if you want to wait or close the app. It doesn't take long at all for it if you want but it's a hassle when I'm gaming lol. Also the screen is rather unresponsive and I'm confident it's the app and not my Kindle fire.most of the time I can't just move the screen one way or the other I kinda have<br />work at it. Hoping for an update to fix these bugs.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|this movie was ok but the reacher character was a bigger guy in the books so that could have been better
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am a huge despicable me fan and this game is perfect! It's like temple run but I actually think it's more fun! The only bad thing is that at first it takes a while to load... but it was only 5 min.... it's worth it tho!
B005544V6A|5.0|A. Fresh and fun entertainment source of a fun  program with the ingredients  to bring you back for more. The tv series of potato chips , &#34;you can't just watch one show&#34;. Good luck
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I think I'm more of a Thriller fan than I care to admit but I finally found time to relax to the sounds this old codger really does love.<br />The shipping and delivery were right on time, and Michael was every bit as smooth and energetic as ever. I guess I'll always be an Amazon fan also. I'll always recommend Amazon to all my friends and love ones.<br />Thanks guys and dolls.
B00B7807PM|5.0|First, let me say that I find some UK shows to be unworthy, but Downton Abbey is one of the best series I have seen so far.  Each episode from Season 1 all the way to Season 3 has been breathtaking, riverting, full of suspense, and highly addictive acting. After watching I almost feel as if I myself have been thrown back into the early part of the 20th century when change was beginning after the war.  The show is well crafted to include time appropriate attire, language, social class, status, and behavior.  It also shows how families begin to evolve with the increase of technology.<br /><br />This show is well written and well cast. If you see it pop up on your Instant Prime feed, do have a look at it. I passed it up for many weeks and finally decided to watch. I was most certainly glad I did. I will be looking forward to Season 4 when it airs on PBS Masterpiece.<br /><br />Enjoy it!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is an enjoyable game. Much more than expected from a free game. It provides a nice way to pass time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it :) this is an awesome game it's also very funny I hope they make another part of it
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|pretty fun game had a good time playing this game and its challenging the challenges are cool its worth it to down load
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun for all ages and I love how it's a combination between Temple Run&trade;and Subway Surfers&trade; I recommend it to everyone.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|If you take it as a comedy, it's reasonably funny and a decent movie. If you take it as anything else (especially seriously), this ranks up there with Gigli and Plan B in terms of badness.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I was captivated from the first page, I love the storyline, Gideon Cross is someone I'd love to come accross...can't wait for the 4th installment.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I play this everyday and this game is so addicting. I would recommend this for anyone especially if they like the movie despicable me.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars left me at a loss of words. Showing you that sometimes \\"they were strong and fought hard\\" doesn't quite cut it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Enjoyed reading about Chris and what he had to go through to protect our freedoms. Gave me a new appreciation for the men and women in our military and the sacrifices they make for our freedom.
B009C7JS14|5.0|Works great!!! Really accurate with beautiful backgrounds! I won't use any other weather app! Can save multiple locations! Just love it!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|THERE IS A GOOD LESSON FOR US ALL IN THIS STORY!<br />We should all look at our own selves and how we treat others<br />and try to be better.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|The book was fantastic. The pace sagged on places, but the slog was always rewarded. Beautifully written and inventive besides.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I bought this CD not knowing what to expect.  It's got it all, quality songs, production and a man who takes his craft very seriously.  Way to go Tom, Rare is the album that has something for everyone and you remained true to yourself in the process.  Cannot recommend this album enough!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|i like the game a lot, but once u beat all the levels... theres nothing to do... and theres not very many levels
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Honestly, it's just damn funny.  The writing is sharp and deliciously unpredictable.  All the back-story info on the various shows and films etc she's been associated with was very interesting.  Read it.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|I started 24 season 1 a year ago, and I just finished season 8 last night. It is definitely the best show I have ever watched! I have never gotten so attached to a show. I was so sad last night when I finished season 8, but it was a great ending. Now I am excited for the new season coming out next summer.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|I have been a fan forever and saw the boys in April 13 in a small club.  I love the blues.  After seeing them, Billy is my hero - what he produces with that guitar is awesome and unique.  This album is simply their best and returns to the roots.  I have had the disc for 3 days and listened 7 times.  Buy it
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent read.  Suspenseful and well written.  Will continue to enjoy reading Mr Landay's work. Very insightful in his portrayal of his characters.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|This album/CD is very well done, and all I've been listening to for the last 3 weeks.  Every song is good.  Not thrash like early Megadeth, although there are some elements like that in the songs, but very melodic...
B005HSG3VK|1.0|kindle fire lightweight microshell folio case cover by marware pink  I was very disappointed in the product  it looks cheap and does not prop the book properly for 39.99 I could have gotten a much better one at most any local store
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|This movie was terrible and very predictable. Markie Mark minus the funky bunch is always nice to look at though.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|It's a good book<br />It's only 109 pages so it's not hard<br />I read it and I'm only 10 years old
B009OYSFDM|4.0|This series struggled getting started but picked up the pace and the acting towards the end of season one. It can be a little hokey but the story line ends up being pretty good. I didn't follow the comic so I can't speak for the authenticity. And season two was also a big improvement, not bad for the CW
B0094K1WZE|4.0|In line with previous MI movies. Good plot, good characters, and plenty of suspenful action. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys action movies.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So fun for little kids! The graphics are unbelievable and never blurry. It's a great app for quick and easy fun for the kids.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Oh My Goodness, this was an incredible episode to a fantastic series, can not wait to watch more! Love Daryl (Norman R's character) Just can not get enough of WALKING DEAD!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CKKHB0A|5.0|This season was awesome!! Filled with a lot of close calls. You will enjoy it just as much as the previous seasons. I've been rooting for him since day 1...he may be a serial killer, but he is a good person as well. Such a likable character! :)
B002S43V3Y|5.0|We grownups have loved this movie since the 1970s but our college-age kids' friends hadn't seen it -- great story, great music, great movie!
B000ARFNNM|1.0|I received the DVV on time but it did not work in my \\"american\\" DVD player. Apparently it was my fault because I didn't read read the fine print that it \\"doesn't work on your player (you do not have a regionfree-player).But this information is always mentioned in our offer and also in the amazon item description.\\" I sent it back and I am wait for a refund.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|Too often the movie disappoints compared to the book. The movie didn't capture the depth of emotion the book had, but I think for a movie, it represented the book pretty well. My family members who had not read the book at all also very much liked the movie.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|You go to The Weather Channel for information, not pretty icons and ADVERTISING that takes up half the screen.  And pop up Achievements....????
B0044DEAUA|5.0|This is one of the best electronic gadgets I've ever purchased from Amazon. I've had it hooked up a week and it works flawlessly.<br />Sounds like the person you're speaking to is in the car with you. I've even started recommending it to friends.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Great book.  Dan Brown has a wonderful gift for story telling that keeps you fully engaged and unable to put it down.
B00B9LNK5G|5.0|When I first heard the title track a couple of months ago (before the album was released) I felt like it was a huge departure from Queen of Denmark and I didn't really know what to make of it. Then I saw a concert video online of &#34;I am the Greatest Mother...&#34; and I was interested, as that is such a moving song.<br /><br />Fast forward to the album's release. I sat down with headphones on and listened to the album all the way through. I was completely blown away by this one-of-a-kind, heart-on-your-sleeve masterpiece. It is like JG decided that he had some things to say and invented a musical style to express himself in.<br /><br />The songs are beautiful, interesting, moving, chilling... Definitely check this one out and support this inspiring artist!
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|I struggled through this book, but finally finished it.  It is a sad story with a twist at the end... but many parts drug on and were boring.
B00CFA225Y|3.0|This movie pretty much followed the traditional story.The acting was good.The visual effects were good,but I thought the 3d effects could have been better.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Typical le Carre novel, I almost always enjoy his work even if his anti-government bias is barely disguised.  The end of this one left me hanging a bit but I won't disclose why for those who have not yet read it.  The characters are plausible and the setting detail and dialogue are very realistic.  If you are a le Carre fan you probably want to read A Delicate Truth (although to my way of thinking it might be more aptly named &#34;An In-delicate Truth&#34;.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Well written and acted. Checks a lot of the tv stereotype boxes but is actually fairly involving and can make you think about the judgements and actions we make and take each day. Or you can just watch it and enjoy it
1781162646|5.0|Joyland was a book that held my interest throughout the entire story. I would recommend this to anybody that enjoys a S. King novel  or just a good mystery story!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved the book and the way Dr. Eben described his experience, I loved every single word in the book but honestly &#34;All is well&#34; - I am a Muslim and I am sure the book gave us a depth that God is big, God is merciful, that God is great !<br />I had attended a conference in Baghdad in 1998 as I remember at the Iraqi Medical Association and I was at that time in my second year College of Medicine, and the conference was about NDE ! It is pretty the same in the way of description Dr. Eben mentioned and they were at the conference talking from western point of view, but they mentioned those people who suffered from NDE, will have extra power, I think you have it now doctor, you could convince the science and based on your experience that the experience you got was real ! I loved the book and would love to read it many times !
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this is cooler organ donation to be a student home and abroad to the world and to the public and private equity firm and its allies
B00BSBY38A|3.0|I think I get it and I understand it got some prizes but my impression is this was obtuse for the sake of being arty and without substantial artistic purpose.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|It is a wonderful book, for anyone.  I am in my seventies and find the story interesting and imaginative.<br />I recommend it to anyone who loves kids and likes to read
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Quite violent but, for the genre, quite well done. The book is well done. For movie world, the screenplay misses some opportunities in the relationship between father and daughter as well as between daughter and Reacher. We enjoyed the movie and recommend it to rent.
0529064847|5.0|Its the Bible I expected. Ive purchased  2 before (gifts) and one Bible had some print issues.
B005MJFA2W|3.0|Very interesting book showing how we do our decisions explaining the psicological role of the thinking way. And in the end, the best way is to use both systems, one complementing the other.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Definitely worth trying out.  Especially for the price.  I haven't struggled like this for some time.  Highly recommend it for people who like puzzles.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|I was skeptical at first when I heard God is Dead.  Thought it sounded too much like solo Ozzy.  I purchased the regular version and had to get the deluxe for the extra songs.  I LOVE IT!  Black Sabbath is definitely back!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I read an article that Dr. Alexander's attending physician disputes his claim of losing all consciousness during his week long coma, so I'm skeptical of his story's legitimacy. Additionally, much of the book covers his biography prior to this experience and the activities of his family during the coma, and only about half of the text discusses his out of body experience.
B008JFUPOY|4.0|This movie definitely teaches life lessons to people of all ages.<br />Children: Never give up.<br />College Students: You're going to college for skills that won't be needed in a few years.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game and if I had a minion I would care for it as if it was my baby.
0807014273|5.0|I LOVE THE BOOK... I READ A LITTLE OF THE BOOK AT THE HOSPITAL SO I DETERMINED TO GET THE BOOK....<br />STORY IS SO TOUCHING AND INCREDIBLE.<br />THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THIS IS A BOOK TO PASS ON
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|Even though El Dorado and Rio Bravo are essentially the same story with a few character changes, they are both great John Wayne movies none the less.
B009RH9HDS|4.0|I bought the revolve case because there aren't many out there that support both landscape and portrait mode for the kindle fire hd. This one can even be turned around to charge while in the case. It's a little bulkier than most cases but no heavier or thicker than a normal book, plus it can make it feel protected. It does what it says for the most part and I can finally read in portrait mode without having to hold it.<br /><br />The part where it loses a star is using the hand strap. The swivel design that allows you to turn the kindle 180 degrees becomes an issue when you try to hold onto the hand strap to read. You can secure the one side with the elastic band, but the other side will cause the kindle to flop towards you while it's in the case because it's not secure. So if you use the hand strap, it would be best to hold onto the kindle from that side so it doesn't catch you by surprise. It won't fall out because it is secure by the snap enclosure, but it can still flap open on one side and hit something. This wasn't a huge deal for me since I don't really care much for hand straps anyway.<br /><br />Overall it's a good sturdy case that is versatile in viewing positions and still allows you easy access to charging.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've been using this case a lot and I really do like it. I can get used to the open flap issue with the handstrap by holding that side closed while in that position. Normally it's great because I can use it at my desk and still read like a portrait-style book, which was the main reason for buying it. It seems to be made of a good quality. I bought the orange color and it really stands out in my purse when I need to find it, so overall it is worth it.
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|The World According to Bob is the second book about James Bowen's life with the very special cat Bob.  It is funny, touching and just a really good read.  I am off to buy the related children's book, and may need to get hard copies of both books in addition to the e book versions.<br /><br />If I ever encounter a signing, here or in the UK, I will certainly go and stand in line.<br /><br />I hope to see many more books for many more years.
B0063GORYU|2.0|This product does not live up to its discription.  I found it difficult to understand and I was unable to use it successfully.
B00C81LYH2|4.0|My daughter has a gazillion Barbies. This collector's Barbie basically looks the same as any other of them. The gown is somewhat more elaborate than the usual outfit, and looks real nice, the hair is big and blond, and the make-up is very pronounced - but other than that I do not see any big difference. The doll comes in a cardboard box with a plastic window, which you probably could use as a display case.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my son and I love playing this game.  it is so much fun to play.  a total blast to play
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This is a superb follow on to the first books. It is hard to follow the development of the characters and some of the location changes, but you expect that with these books.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|IT'S 300 ON BLURAY!!!<br /><br />If you have never seen this movie WTH are you waiting for. Especially if you like Gladiator, the Sparticus series, Any of the Conan movies and movies/shows of the like you will love this. It looks awesome Bluray on a big screen! One of my favorite movies ever!<br /><br />Totally recommend!!!
B0050DZN4K|4.0|The new improved freely interface is generally good. Stable and smooth. It could have been a bit more intuitive but then maybe that is asking too much of this relatively young reader.<br />it is the best in the reader field and a fine substitute for the leaner quicker and more versatile Google reader that was dropped by Google.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Joker steals this movie! I didn't think there would be a better joker than Jack Nickelson, but this version of the Joker is hands down the best. Heath Ledger is legendary in this role.<br /><br />Totally recommend!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I saw the movie before reading the book and I enjoyed reading the story even more; it's heart warming and entertaining. I will recommend it to a friend.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I've been using simpler to do list apps so I'm pretty happy with the functionality of this one. Sorts, priorities, due dates etc.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I must say, the Christopher Reeves Superman franchise was awesome...  But Man of Steel pretty much overtook them all.  Zack Snyder did a wonderful job on this movie (despite some of his other films).  He really kept the emotion flowing and there are a lot of Christian aspects to the movie.<br />  In the middle of the movie there was a very emotional part and I cried.  It was probably the most I've cried in a movie (I haven't seen Les Miserable's yet :-).)<br />  The movie had some very engaging action parts and a few funny parts (I wish they could've put a few more funny parts in.  Oh well, there's always the sequel.)<br />  I thought they picked a very nice Lois Lane (Amy Adams)  and an Exceptional Kal-el/Clark Kent/Superman (Henry Cavill).<br />  I think that this is a GREAT movie for Christopher Reeves lovers and for newcomers to Superman.  Thank You Zack Snyder, you hit a home run!<br />  --Ben Morrison
B0094BB4TW|4.0|works just as expected....no glitches....I see my newsfeed, photos, etc...pretty much everything as web FB except the ads! I'm happy with it!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This gaming mouse is very easy to learn how to use and very user-friendly. For non-gamers, it's a good mouse to choose too.
B00D0SA8I8|5.0|This is a pretty decent map program. I was searching for an alternative to google maps since I'm unable to put the google maps app on my phone. I put the free version on my phone which allows for 10 downloads. I put on 4 state maps and 2 voice packages to try it out. It seems to work really well but there will be a learning curve to understand the interface. Go to the OsmAnd home website read some &#34;how-to's&#34; and FAQS. Once I get the hang of it, I'll probably purchase the full product....seems reasonable and full of functionality.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|A very challenging puzzler! This was my first time playing a Cut the Rope game and I love everything about it, especially the cute little Om Nom character! Will definitely try out the previous two games. Can't wait for the new levels!
B008XG1X18|5.0|works clean & fast! I love being able to quickly go to the &#34;Food&#34; category while I'm at the grocery store to get ideas!
B002436WFI|4.0|it still was a good movie.  Several parts of the book and characters were left out but it pretty well followed the general outline of the book.  The movie lasted for over 3 hours and would have been about 9 hours if all was included.  The characters that were included were well portrayed.  The villain, Played by Tim Curry, was indeed sinister.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I don't use Twitter a lot so I don't know of any &#34;missing&#34; features but this seems to do what I need it to do. I see tweets, can follow others, etc.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You must buy this app. This is the coolest game ever. Even my mom and dad love this because you must use your brain in it. But they need flint and steel on creative. I love this app
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The time period was interesting.  All the characters from downstairs to upstairs were so intense with their lives.  I felt like I knew all of them at one time in the past.  Great acting, wonderful scenery and fabulous costumes for that time period.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Better info, better organized, faster loading and more user friendly.  Gladly used on my mobile device.  Love my Kindle, too.
1781162646|1.0|I couldn't finish the book. I'm a so-so fan of King's and I've not read a lot of his work, but Joyland is one I'll drop in the unreadable pile. With each page turn I hoped that SK would reveal to me some plot, some boogy man, something to draw me toward a reason to read this. Just nostalgic meanderings of a rich and famous author who's unfortunately gotten into a habit of writing for himself and not his fans.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very fun game. like the other said, not too easybut not too differical. great game to play while waiting for train. enjory very much and looking forward for the updates.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was so disappointed in the 50 Shades of Gray series as the main character was stupid and annoying.  Conversely, the main character in this book is more believable and interesting.  Much hotter than 50 Shades of Gray too.  My new favorite author!
B005ISQ7JM|2.0|I thought I'd expand my awareness of technologies I didn't know about when I saw these &#34;What Is&#34; thingamabobs come up on my Kindle app.  I downloaded some and was completely underwhelmed.  While the material was informative, for the trouble, I would rather just use Wikipedia.  Besides, firing up my Kindle app on the android takes over a minute - so I only open it for serious reading.  I guess if you don't have a device with WiFi or internet, maybe these things are useful, but when I have the other options, I've decided against trying more of these type of booklets out.  I don't really have any complaints about the information presented even though I'm an engineering type guy, but again, when I want to get a quick and reasonably complete overview of something, I feel better served by Wikipedia or internet searches.  That's not to say I don't think there's an audience for these booklets, but I'm not part of it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is amazing I could play it every day. it is so fun to play.  it is also free to get.you should get Despicable me:Minion rush.
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|When I first saw this film with my Dad in the theatre, I have to say that it was more emotional than watching the real event on the news.  Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts give outstanding performances as both husband and wife torn apart by a catastrophy that impacts millions families around the world.  The film emerses viewers right into the center of the action and doesn't let them go.  My only complitant about the DVD is that there wasn't enough behind the scenes material or interviews with the real family portrayed in the movie.  All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone interested in looking for an intense and emotionally gripping story.
B008Y7BE7E|5.0|Great movie. It was funny and action at the same time! What else? I can't believe I hadn't watched it yet! Watch it!
B008B3GP2A|5.0|I had not heard all of the songs on this album before purchasing and ended up liking everyone! There are several songs that will be familiar as they have gotten a lot of radio play.<br />This album is definitely on my favorites playlist.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It has really changed the way I look at my life. My perception towards things is no longer it is impossible everything is possible
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|was a great game. here is my experience with it on kindle fire hd, had an awesome game going only had ocean habitats left to unlock, then about a month or two ago they updated game where u can release animals and save them had about 1/2 of that completely done and 4 of the guardians  they unlock, then for some reason the game always did a 57.27 mb download every time i start it, one day it was downloading it and it kicked me back to my game select carosell and would never load again, deleted app then reinstalled and had to start over now after hrs on it I noticed it didn't have to do the 57.27 mb download but once, however I got to the mission where u visit neighbor guy and buy table and chair with the hearts, then it takes u back to ur zoo and it wants u to place the table and chair only problem is it wont let me. try rebooting turning on off kindle etc no luck does the same thing and cant continue with game, very disappointed with this game now, wasted enough time on it not gonna restart again. Deleting off my kindle for good. I would give 5 stars if it didn't crash and burn twice on me, but because I did like it I will still give it 3 stars maybe try again later down the line.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|It is way to hard to get acorns for free. Other than that it's not a bad game. It is also too hard to win acorns.

B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I love having the Adobe reader on my Kindle so that I'm able to receive & view my documents. Immediately instead of having to wait until I get to my desktop computer, sometimes my docs are tome sensitive so I'm glad to have Adobe on my kindle.
B004QX07G4|5.0|You can't go wrong purchasing a book written by Ellen DeGeneres, IMHO! It was my first book purchase using my new Samsung Galaxy 2.0, 7&#34; tablet.  If you're appreciative of immediate gratification, taking advantage of Amazon's pricing on e-books is the way to go!  My tablet's already paying for itself, as the book was only $4.99--a significant savings! :o)
B00992CF6W|4.0|Needs to have updates that are cool and multiplayer needs to be better but the character should be able to change clothes instead of just armor
B009PXNFQE|5.0|This whole package was very stunning in this day of downloads and such. Many good songs and alot of content with the added dvd. Very good product here. Any pink fan will enjoy it for sure.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This one will get you addicted but your finger will get tired.  It is also sort of difficult even at the easiest level but you will get out eventually.  Pay attention to the clues!
B0000029AL|4.0|Many people believe this album is not that good but it is. Give this a listen and remember this was their first album. If you listen to it that way you will enjoy it more. Listen to it with no pre-conceived notions and enjoy the music.
B000RUAR5G|5.0|This a phenominal and classic 90s movie. There is no better combination of cartoon and live action than Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny
B0045DO8NI|5.0|I literally love every song on this greatest hits package. The added dvd of her videos is icing on the cake. Any casual fan of Pink will be amazed at this collection. Very nice release
0446572985|5.0|I am in love with all of David Baldacci books right now. I can't wait to read more of what he has out.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|First book I've ever finished in over 3 years. Now if only other men would read this and l learn a few things
B00DU74U74|4.0|I had started to read the book and found it a little slow and a little confusung at times.  But the movie was a nice surprise.  they did a very good job in keeping the 2 personalities separate.  The concept of the souls was beautuful.  Thought the story and visual affects were nicely done too.  I really enjoyed this movie.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|The applicator allows accurate placement of the compound, and, it does what it is supposed to do.  I was able to complete the installation of the CPU Cooling fan in rapid time.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I've had the WC app since I purchased my Kindle Fire HD.  Had to delete it and exchange it for another app after the recent changes made to it.  It's no longer easy to read or navigate.  Don't know why they had to ruin a good app.
B004IFD9HE|4.0|I found this movie thoroughly enjoyable.  It is a feel good type of movie.  Adam Sandler shows his versatility in acting where he can come across as a human.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 6 yr old and  I are having lots of fun playing this game. First of its kind that we have found.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I have a HTC My touch and, whilst I love the phone, the volume and quality of the hands free is atrocious. I have had this product for 2 months and use it all the time. I am also learning more features, such as voice dialing and it keeps getting better.<br />The volume is LOUD and the clarity good on both ends.<br />I highly recommend it
B002GHHHME|5.0|One of those that can be watched over and over. Saw it in the theater, and one of our stormy night go-to movies.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|This is the last George Martin book that I will purchase. He is an excellent story teller but he goes into so much unnecessary detail (backgrounds of ancillary characters that never reappear, what characters are wearing, eating, etc., historical backgrounds, etc.) that he detracts from the tale. This was supposed to be the last book of the series but nothing is resolved. Martin only offers a very weak explanation at the end of the book that should have been at the beginning where it could have warned readers and even then he lies by not disclosing his intention to add at least two more books after the supposed final fifth. At this point Martin is treating this series as a cash cow and is totally disrespectful of his readers.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun for the whole family!!!! Really enjoy playing with my daughter. She loves interacting with the horses! And the poop game is fun.
B00BZAYZ82|5.0|Excellent acting - one of my favorite movies; such a poignant display of man's courage and war's futility.  You should read the book!
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is a great book!  I am a huge Harry Potter fan and loved reading another of JK Rowling's works.  The tone and voice of the work are very similar to the HP books but this is clearly mean for adults.  The author is an amazing story teller and she really draws the reader into the lives of the characters.  Somewhat explicit and parts and the plot is a bit dark.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this so much wish it was longer but it was so intense and play it loud for<br />most dramatic effect.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Pros:<br />The greatest pro is the depth of character - since the actors are singing real-time they're able to put a lot of depth and emotion into their performances, which definitely shows.<br />The feel of the movie, production-wise, is one of realism. It's dirty, it's tough, it's real.<br />The acting was great, definitely above average.<br />The singing was pretty good - more of a pro than a con.<br /><br />Cons:<br />However, there were moments when the singing was a bit strained in a couple ways:<br />1. As if they were trying too hard to make a conversation into a song.<br />2. The actor's voices themselves were occasionally strained.<br /><br />Overall, it's definitely worth seeing, especially if you're a fan of Les Miserables or redemption stories in general.
B006S053K8|5.0|I am no movie critic, I love some movies and hate others. I really enjoyed the 80s style film that was a throw back to brakfast club style story. I like to think of my last days of my final summer were as fun and romantic as these. Good movie lots of laughs and I will watch again.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The old  was was great and I would have given it five stars. They changed the app a week or two ago and it is not good.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I loved the first two books & was very excited to see how the story ends for Eva & Gideon. I thought that the 1st book was better than FSOG, but as a series, it no longer compares.<br /> Luckily, after paying $9.99 each for the 1st two, I borrowed this book from the library. Otherwise I would have asked amazon for a refund! The greediness has to stop!  This was originally billed as a trilogy - just wrap it up already!<br />I usually love Sylvia Day's writing & have read many (@ least 10) of her books. After reading this book of filler, I assure you that I will never buy another. Sure, I want to know how the story ends, but not enough to spend another $20.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is awesome. i love everything about...except maybe how long it takes for certain eggs to hatch...but other than that its great
B004GJYROG|5.0|I've got looney toons back in action, so having this sort of complete the collection I've been wanting so far.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great app! I love how there's a huge choice of characters! It is a fantastic game for kids.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This is a great backpack for birding.  Nice padding for binoculars, space for bird books, pencils, pens, compass, &  water.  Carry an extra set of clothes when traveling.  Plenty of space and very comfortable
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Working in a middle school myself, I found the scenarios totally realistic.  Loved the perspectives of different people.  What courageous characters.
B000SGSU58|5.0|My second Michael Connelly novel is a five star book, no doubt about it. \\"The Concrete Blonde\\" is like taking the courtroom drama of John Grisham, throwing it into a blender with the hard boiled crime novels of Robert Parker, and coming out with something that is downright remarkable. Boy, oh boy- this is a fast paced, engaging read that was a delight to listen to (it certainly made a couple of work days fly right by!), and it was delivered with masterful narration by the reader, who invoked a gruff, hard case voice that perfectly fits the genre.<br /><br />Connelly weaves a fascinating tale of murder and mystery - it might be deemed a \\"period piece\\" nowadays, because nobody has cell phones or internet access, which makes for a curious, compelling read (these were the conditions that existed during my childhood). Characters actually have to locate land lines to get a hold of each other, which is rather charming. What needs to be mentioned is just how well Connelly tells his tale. He had me outright fooled throughout, and I'm betting he'll fool you, too, no matter how familiar you might be with the genre. He's just that good. And it all makes sense, once the final page is read, rather than leaving gaping plot holes or introducing an ill-placed deus ex machina. I'm coming to really care for the character of Harry Bosch, who is more deeply layered than I had originally perceived. Also, the blood and gore is kept quite minimal (especially for a book that revolves around a serial killer), instead of being used as a crutch to move the plot forward, which I really appreciated.<br /><br />I loved this book. I loved it so much, I'm now listening to my third consecutive Connelly novel, \\"The Fifth Witness\\".
B006LSZECO|4.0|Second half of book a real turn around from first half of book.  My sympathies changed back and forth with each new revelation of the characters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I recommend it to my kids and everyone else. It is very much like the movie. Just as funny. Let it kid get it.
1401937519|5.0|I had seen a video with the author and Wayne Dyer and bought this book after that and read it on a flight recently.  It was captivating!  It gave me such reassurance with some struggles I've been dealing with lately.  I felt much lighter after reading and realize it's time to stop taking myself so seriously and enjoy this amazing gift of life.  I'd also recommend Journey of Souls by Michael Newton which I read recently.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Needed a calculator while on vacation to balance my bank book.  I had taken the bare necessities with me.  Had my kindle for relaxing reading.  Downloaded this app.  Now I have everything I could possibly need.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I like it but add like 7 or 8 more then it will be my favorite game so just try
B0017313I2|5.0|The beginning was somewhat slow and I thought Nicolas Cage  actually may have made a poor movie. I was wrong, once the movie got going and the plot was set it was riveting with a surprise ending. I recommend it.....
B007ZCOT6C|3.0|I bought this book because of the reviews on Amazon.com.<br /><br />The girl is white, the guy Mexican, and the background is gang wars and what not. There is one thing I did not manage to understand: even with so much activities in the lives of the protagonists they manage to get admitted to University. When did they have time to study?<br /><br />Another issue that cropped up while reading, I thought that I could read a teen romance, but after more than half the book it started tiring me and I closed it.<br /><br />Buy this at your own risk.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Maybe it was just me because I was watching the movie while doing housework and I could not follow it. When I sat down a put my full attention to the move I was impressed. The writing was creative and the story line flowed beautifully. Halle Berry and Tom Hanks did an out standing performance. This move is worth watching a few times.....
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I have had this app quite a while and just uninstalled it to find something better. The first version of this app had serious flaws like not updating weather data on time. I often had to reboot just to get current info. Now the new version released in summer 2013 is just unwieldy. I cannot access what I want quickly and it is no longer convenient to track multiple locations. Lousy software IMHO.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|I have been a Stargate fan since the beginning. I have seen the movie a couple of times and I still enjoy it. Rent, buy, enjoy....
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Words can't describe how great this series is but I guarantee once you see Matt smith as the doctor you won't be able to stop watching!
B000V39KDO|3.0|This was an OK movie. The story line was not complicated nor were the movie sets. I did like the underling principles portrayed of following you word, devotion to duty and patriotism.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|this game was too hard for me. a real car would not flip over that easily. make an easy version
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Goodwin did a masterful job on this. Everyone who has read it from my recommendation has recognized the approach taken (the accounts of those around the man) in this work is masterful. For a work of biography, it is a page turner, it is personal.<br />When the end of the book cam with Lincoln's death, I actually felt like I had lost a friend.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|I had not seen this movie in years but was so glad to see it again. Incredible story and acting. There was no need for special effects with a story this good.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Collecting the pieces of research as he did makes Gladwell's work a well woven mystery. That opportunity, hard work, historical factors and other inputs contribute to success, it is the orchestration of all of these contributions which point to a greater grace behind it all. The commitment of others in our lives is so crucial to making a difference and this is amply illustrated in what is not said like the many early mornings of a hockey family, the many late nights of a scholar or long hours of a concert pianist. However, it is in the story of Gladwell's family where his greatest illustration is made. The points he has crafted throughout the book become personal. We can see a lot of our own life in these examples.
B001DLWF8U|2.0|First off, the whole movie is done in black and white, and it would surprise me if the budget went over $1000.  If you don't like weird camera angles as well as very strange themes, then this movie isn't for you (as it wasn't my taste either).  Not much of a plot, and many things in the movie were left to interpretation.  It was more like a college philosophy project than a movie that's supposed to provide entertainment value.  You may have a different opinion, but it wasn't worth my time.
0884271153|5.0|This is a weightier book than The Goal and more oriented to full P&L management embracing all the operational principals from The Goal and building upon it. This is a yearly or biannual read for me as it refreshes how one should connect the dots for business and in other organizational settings including the home.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I loved it it was so fun and my little girl loves it it is Maggie a time filling game when I'm bored
0060977493|5.0|I'll admitt, every now and then Arundhati would wonder off too far left or right in her discriptions right in the middle of something interesting that I wanted to pull my hair out. However, this happened only a coupld of times so didn't distract from the main meat of the book.<br />With beautifuly well constructed prose, informative paragraphs, great characters development and overall sense of India I feel transported and love it.<br />Yes, I cried in the end because it was the end, at least I didn't throw it against the wall like I've done some of the my most recent reads. This book I'll, gladly, read again.
B005DOKIYG|3.0|I have a cover and had hoped this would fit over and allow for more security.  The cover barely fits, not  what I had hopped for.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this series! I don't miss the commercials. It is very character driven and keeps surprising me! I look forward to each new episode!
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app is great and I would recommend it to others. However it needs more building materials. This is a sick app! :)
0143034901|5.0|As a Spanish teacher I thoroughly enjoyed the book on many levels. It is exciting, beautifully written and the references to the city of Barcelona add a sophisticated touch.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Enjoyed immensely  the graphics are great. The story line is little weird though.  I can't wait for the next one.
B008S4YZCO|3.0|The games is good over all, but every time i try to add a friend it won't add them, also the prices to get the monsters are ridiculously high for no reason, thus making it harder to get further in the game. I like the game, but few glitches and things need to be fixed as well.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Heroine gets weaker and weaker as series progresses.  Also the lack of any sexual content what-so-ever makes the book unbelievable.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Game is fun semi role playing. Like the action with fighting. Need help with younger kids. My 5 year old enjoys the battles and collecting nectar and seeds. I do the rest.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Heroine doesn't drive any action, she just reacts to it.  She's like a cork floating in a river.  As with the third book the lack of any sexual innuendo, content or discussion seems unrealistic for 15-16 year olds.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I got it on my kindle fire and when I clicked on it to play it told me I needed to download  a more space and a file to play. I have plenty of room on my kindle to fit it and I don't know what the download does but it can't be very good.
B004G600A4|5.0|I'm like a four year old with this movie....I can watch it again, and again, and again, and again, and I never get bored.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I really like the app but I do have a minor complaint don't like some of the ads it gets in the way of seeing the weather. I like the map.
1612680003|5.0|The book was good! I would recommend to anyone who is looking to make a difference. Definitely was impactful on my life.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|This book had me in stitches of laughter, fits of anger and a river of tears. So very well written and perfectly executed that you can only love this book and the characters inside.
B00D8RYV52|1.0|We have purchased all the Dr.Panda games and love them all. This one - doesn't load. We see the starting screen and then it crashes. We bought it a couple of weeks ago- I was hoping it would have had a fix by now. We reported the issue via \\"Report a problem with this App\\" button.<br /><br />Do we... get a refund i it isn't working?<br /><br />Only other concern that I have, which made me go back to check the permissions on the other games, was the \\"Access Fine Location\\" permission which is considered one of the higher-threat, bad permissions to have on a device.<br /><br />Additional: I'm getting negative reviews on this one, but I usually get great \\"help\\" notices on Dr Panda games, so I find this kinda amusing. I wrote about our experience with this app. If it's working for you - I'd like to know how to fix it for us, we haven't gotten to use this app in a month and it's *still installed*. We installed twice, just in case something was amiss.  We've sent in reports about there being an \\"issue with this app\\" and also requested help from amazon.com but we haven't heard anything yet. It's been a month since our purchase. Or are you mad because I mentioned the more dangerous app permissions associated with this one? O,o I don't get it. lol
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|One of the best book I am reading sofar. I like it. I recommend to my family and friends.<br /><br />Thanks.<br />Kiran Kt
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is AWESOME because there is so many cool costumes and I love when it's outside the best!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This game is a great idea and all but it kept making my kindle shut itself off and on and also spazed out my other apps. When i deleted it all the issues disappeared.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Typical Ken Follett offering: incredible story teller.  He brings history to life and draws his readers in with great characters and realistic entanglements that enable the reader to feel as though he/she is actually living the history as it is being read.
B005EHQGTS|1.0|Win7 desktop app causes the wireless router to hang and locks out all other attached devices. Requires de-install and resetting of router.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|THIS IS A WILD MOVIE, UNTIL YOU SEE IT MORE THAN ONCE YOU WILL BE CONSTANTLY WONDERING HOW OR WHO IS HE ACCOMPLICING ALL THESE FEATS I HAVE WATCHED IT PROBABLY 4 TIMES ALREADY AND STILL ENJOY IT THOUGH HE IS SICK ONE CAN RELATE
B001GCUNYO|5.0|I found this movie action packed though not for children very exciting constant action most of the movie keeps one on the ball as to the dangers of sick people willing to anything to make a buck
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A good read if you like the Grisham style. Devinitely engaging and worth the read. Looking forward to more of the same!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I am so pleased that I can re-watch all the episodes from Amazon.<br />I can't wiat for the new season and would highly recommend to everyone.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|For (I think...) the first time in my life, I actually watched a movie before reading the novel it was based on. So many people I know  loved the film that I didn't want to be disappointed by reading the book first! I have to say, both were excellent. As usual, there were massive differences between the film and written versions of the story, but in their own rights, both were so well done. And, regardless of the path they take to get there, I'm a sucker for a good love story, which is ultimately what (any version of) \\"The Silver Linings Playbook\\" is...
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Good fun. Slow coins. Slow oil. Slow medals. Not paying for it. Go figure.<br /><br /> Kills time. Brain cheese. Works well. No real issues.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great game for the horse lover. competitions r fun but challenging. something to do if not around real life horses.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|The game is fun, but it's too hard to get better items. They're gouging players into making in app purchases.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book. The way Palacio tells the stoy from different perspectives in a very real way is very touching. It's funny and made me shed some tears also. The best book i've read recently. Very easy to read but very effective in getting the reader inside the story. Loved this family. Very honest plot. I will share this story with my 9 year old girl.
B002U3CCBK|5.0|Original plot.<br /><br />Good research. Paul Torday manages to bring the characters to life in the book, and clasically captures cultural and religious differences.
1451627289|5.0|Although the blurbs and adverts call this a science fiction thriller, King's 11/22/63 is really fantasy, with his hero being introduced to a modern-day, adult, version of the wardrobe from the Narnia books.  If one can suspend belief enough to get past that -- and any reader of fantasy should come ready to do so -- the ensuing tale, part historical romance, part historical thriller (with just a touch of shadowy horror thrown in for good measure) will satisfy the most demanding King reader(i.e., a reader looking for good, unhurried characterization, and a main storyline sprinkled with a few subplots -- those searching out a pell-mell, Michael Chrichton/Lee Child-style thriller need not apply).<br /><br />After school teacher and divorce' Jake Epping learns about the semi-quantum hole-in-space/time portal from his buddy Al -- said portal opening up onto the year 1958 -- and about Al's plan to try and go back in time to stop the assassination, Jake decides to take up Al's flag and do the job for him (Al has recently learned of a fatal illness). The only problem is that the stream of time -- specifically the stream of time in the past -- is a force of nature that doesn't want to be changed, often throwing up dangerous roadblocks (sometimes literally, in the shape of a runaway dump truck) or engaging in \\"re-balancing acts\\" (save one person, watch another get injured or killed).  After one such incident, while living in Texas, under an assumed name, working as a substitute teacher, Jake finds himself falling in love with a young librarian named Sadie Dunhill.<br /><br />While some readers (the aforementioned ones looking for stripped down suspense thrillers) might find this part of the novel the slowest, I personally found it the best part.  As a writer, King is rarely better than when reliving his past, Ray Bradbury style, and his foray into the 1950s -- a mix of school dances, and football games, as well as abusive husbands and small-town snoops -- is as good as anything he cobbled up in \\"The Body\\" and/or \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\".  And while King's penchant for having his older lover's speak in antiquated tongues sometimes seems out of place, here it rings true.  Jake Epping's courtship -- and brief love affair with -- Sadie is both romantic and pragmatic: very New England.<br /><br />But 1963 and both Kennedy and Oswald soon come calling, and Jake gets his head back in the anti-assassination game, with help from a few unexpected sources.<br />Whether Jake succeeds in saving Kennedy is the most important part of the novel, although it does make for an intriguing chapter near the end.  The most important part of the novel comes in what Jake discovers about himself, about his newfound friends, all living in the past.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, King wraps things up neatly. In fact, he does it so well, he's basically written a novel that could have ended in two separate places. The earlier ending -- for which came up with an absolutely _killer_ line -- would be a darker one, but still appropos. But the bittersweet ending King chose to wrap things up with works as well.<br /><br />If there are any other nits to pick, it might be a colloquialism here or there.  When King has Texas guys and gals say \\"podna\\" instead of \\"pard'ner\\", they always sound like rapper-wannbes. But that's a small thing, and easily overlooked.<br /><br />King is one of those authors whose novels either work really well, or fail completely.  Equal parts Ray Bradbury-style paean to the past and part Crichton-style thriller, 11/22/63 walks a fine line between the absurd and the absolutely heart-breaking, firing on all cylinders just when the reader is certain things will give out.  11/22/63 works as well as his best novels, from SALEM'S LOT, THE DEADZONE and MISERY, to THE GREEN MILE, BAG OF BONES and LISEY'S STORY.g he cobbled up in \\"The Body\\" and/or \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\".
