B0064MGU98|5.0|AWESOME- i'm addicted!  I like all the twists and turns!  The drama is just enough and leaves you feeling good at the end of each episode.  It's my escape from reality :)
B000002TLX|4.0|This is a nice CD.  Richard Marx has always had a way with songs that sounds like no one else
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Much better than the series. Now, I may just skip season 2, since I already know how the story ends.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|The best &#34;Miracle On 34th Street&#34; movie ever made!  Natalie Wood was great, as well as the rest of cast!
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|Tom Hardy does a wonderful job in this movie! It's fast paced and kicks up the adrenaline. Loved it! Check it out!
B0099114WO|2.0|Just an OK movie.  Too dull  The acting was good , but something about this movie just did not &#34;click&#34;
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|I'm a Will Smith's fan but even he could not save this movie. Very slow, dragging out script. But the worse is Jayden Smith's acting (if you could call it that). Fortunately, I did not buy the disk but rent it through RedBox.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This was an easy and quick read -- interesting, engrossing, and written with what I interpreted as a real desire to tell the truth and be understood. I'm a fan of the show on Netflix, so I read this book wondering how much of the show was true. I was pleasantly surprised to find that much of the show is sensationalized but with nods throughout the series to what the real Piper experienced. Well-wrote the read!
B00BVYJG18|5.0|I like KSE but their past 2 cds i wasnt that into them they are good, but this cd is a great cd songs are good and great.
B0038P59A0|3.0|Its okay, nothing very special, I was disappointed it was not better, did seem like Sherlock Holmes movie to me
B001224WBS|5.0|if you are just getting into depeche mode, this is a great cd, i used to have this cd but i lost it, so i bought this mp3 and it is worth it great cd.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is not only the most fun and addictive game I've seen, but it isn't a 'brain-dead' game and it does make you think.  It is also the reason my father is considering getting off his basic phone and getting a smart phone.  He saw me playing this game and wanted to play... three hours later I was begging him to give my phone back.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|very slow first part, confusing multiple characters, somewhat difficult names to keep track of,  gains momentum wlth the ww 2 part. interesting review of history set among fictional characters, but actual world leaders and places. overall worth the effort for history buffs and fans of Follet.
B001FOPODS|4.0|An interesting modern interpretation of the classic.  As an adult, I loved the film.  I have not yet had a child's reaction to this video.  Some of the animation seems a bit eerie.  Brings in the theme of bullying.  Spoiler alert--this video reverts to the original ending for the duck.
B00005YU1O|5.0|if it goes over your head, watch it again. deep. meaningful. artfully done. a masterpiece. opens the doors to higher consciousness... if you let it.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Very visually appealing.  Draws you in.  The hidden object scenes are a challenge, but the puzzles are easy enough.<br /><br />A rather good experience.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read the whole series and loved it all!  Plan on starting the Shadow Series next.  Orson Scott Card is terrific.
B002361MLA|5.0|One of the most solid books I have read in my life.  Remarkably consistent and convincing; written with authority in the same way as few books I have seen (The China Study, for example, would be one of the very few others).  This book no doubt has been a turning point for many.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|We never watched this series while it was running, but heard so much about how good it was that we had to check it out.  Hooked!
B0015T6G2G|5.0|VERY GOOD AS A FACT HE LIVE FOR TOO LONG, HOBE HE LIVE A LONG  LIFE, FREE AS HE DESERVES.<br />  JOSE M JORGE
B000FC1AGG|4.0|This is a sweet little book, filled with laughter. The characters are so delightful and it turned my not so good mood into a much better one. This should be read when you are exhausted or having trouble concentrating.. It won't matter if you can't give this book much attention, since it will slide over you like silk.Wonderful read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun I wish I can own this game like man  th  game  because I could own lots of money.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I really enjoyed season 1 and rolled right into season 2. Not at all what I expected out of this show
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is awesome it's so much Easter to get into facebook cause u just press on the app and bam there is facebook so now you don't Hart to go to the internet and the type in facebook and then log in now you can just go right ON to your Facebook account
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This is Columbo at his very best and you will enjoy every minute of every dvd. This was a great show so buit it
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I am new to this game and can't seem to find anywhere that explains how to play. It could be fun if I can figure it out!
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|Love it! I swore I wasn't going to get into this series and I'm so glad I did! Glad to see they still have a story to tell.
0345529057|3.0|Alright, I ordered the collection using the a month due to delivery, but it arrived at my doorstep much earlier than expected. But, the condition of the books (four books in a box) is mediocre, where you can see creases, bends and slight damages by the cover and the box itself. Perhaps it happened because I picked the month due delivery. The collection is of a disappointing quality.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Even though you trust your spouse with your inner most thoughts there are somethings that are hard to tell another person.  Especially liked the wrap up at the end of the book.
B002N2LEVM|5.0|awesome.rate 5, glued to my seat. constant change, related to real life with gov't and people. #illuminati #gov't sucks #american beliefs
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I finally read this book because so many friends recommended it. Started it hesitantly, read it voraciously. The characters are each so REAL. The writing beautiful and honest. Each word counts. Each character's flaws, strengths are nuanced and believable. I will read more books by this author - very impressed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this it's great If u love horses u fee d train  compete and care for  the horse  and u can have more than one
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The last four books of the Wheel of Time are a crescendo of awesomeness. They repay who read all the previous books which, save the first two, are still entertaining, but an a lower quality level.
B00FEX1AA2|4.0|This movie slipped right by me in the theaters. I heard no buzz about it, but then I saw it appear under New Releases and it had a good rating, so I gave it a try.<br /><br />WOW. This movie is not perfect, but it's pretty damned good.<br /><br />I could tell almost immediately that this was a cut above most horror movies. The direction was tight, the music was awesome, and the acting much better than the usual fare.<br /><br />As I watched this movie longer, I began to appreciate it even more. There were parts of the movie where I knew exactly what was going to happen. \\"How dumb do you think I am?\\" I muttered.<br /><br />As it turns out, pretty dumb, because every single time I thought I had spotted a genre cliche', damned if the movie didn't pull a left turn on me and catch me completely by surprise. I watch a lot of movies, and I can't tell you what a rare joy it is for me to find a movie that repeatedly catches me by surprise. It just doesn't happen; but it did this time!<br /><br />In terms of atmosphere, writing, and acting, I'd place this film at one notch below \\"The Others\\", and several notches above nearly every other horror film I've seen in recent years. I'm so glad I gave this movie a try!<br /><br />You should try it, too. If you go in with no expectations, I think you'll have a great time!
B0053TMP24|5.0|I literally did not put this book down from the moment I picked it up until the very last page. Loved it!
034580709X|5.0|I have read almost all of the Harry Hole books prior to reading this book.  The Bat isn't quite as good as the later Harry Hole books.  However, if you have enjoyed reading the later Harry Hole books I am very sure that you will enjoy this book also.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|The game has many formats to be used in playing. I have been sticking with the traditional &#34;Turtle&#34; so far. May try &#34;Towers&#34; next.
B00004YW6I|5.0|Along with many others, I consider PJ Harvey's [[ASIN:B004GHYCKW Let England Shake]] to be the best pop/rock album of 2011 (see my review).  Prior to that I had heard little of Harvey's music -- just the songs from [[ASIN:B000001E7T To Bring You My Love]] (1995) that got radio airplay back in the days after the grunge explosion in the early/mid-Nineties when \\"alternative rock\\" stations were everywhere.<br /><br />The brilliance of the 2011 album led me back to this 2000 album, and it is great, really consistently strong from start to finish.  Of course it lacks the piercing anti-war content of \\"Let England Shake,\\" and is more similar to the earlier Nineties albums in terms of the lyrics and sound.<br /><br />For the most part there are three musicians -- PJ Harvey on vocals and guitar (and sometimes keyboards), Mick Harvey on bass (and sometimes drums), and Rob Ellis on drums (and sometimes other instruments).  Thom Yorke makes guest vocalist appearances on \\"Beatiful Feeling\\" and \\"This Mess We're In.\\"<br /><br />The standout track among many excellent ones is \\"The Whores Hustle and the Hustlers Whore,\\" which is the loudest song on the album, with a great guitar riff and scathing vocals.  The booklet includes all the lyrics along with (very small) color photos from the recording sessions.<br /><br />Harvey does uncanny impressions of other singers on a few of the songs.  On the opening number, \\"Big Exit,\\" there are lines that she sings just like Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth.  Then on the second song, \\"Good Fortune,\\" she at times sounds like Patti Smith.  And finally, on the last song, the lovely \\"We Float,\\" she sounds just like Kate Bush.  Not just any Kate Bush, it's the Kate Bush of one of her best-known songs, but I'd have to pull out [[ASIN:B000002UA7 The Whole Story]] to identify which one...<br /><br />I have now heard \\"To Bring You My Love\\" as well, and I think \\"Stories From the City...\\" is better.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I haven't played since 1996 and now I am loving it all over again just in digital form. It is awesome.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Much better than trying to read the little icon at the top. I use this app daily to see if I need to charge my Kindle before I head out or the day.
B00DQR26EC|5.0|Incredible game,love the comedy and the old school style. Have played  for hours without realizing that time is flying by. Would recommend to all gamers and old schoolers.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Beautiful story.....superb acting.  He has a special way of acting how he really feels that someone would have to watch closely to understand it.
B0017YWG2S|5.0|Highly rated by the experts.  The opening song was one of the top 100 of all time.  They were both geniuses with an abundance of talent.  Sadly, they are both deceased, she from a drug overdose.  If you enjoy their music, you should read their bios.  I keep it in my car 24/7 to enjoy while riding.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Found this show on BBC this past season... it is Great show... cannot wait til season 2.... Love it, love it!
B00CWX1HPA|4.0|I liked it!! But I am waiting the complete series. The high resolution and sound are very good. Buy it!!
0425263908|3.0|Did not particularly like this book.  Reminded me too much of 50 shades of gray.  I did like the female character though more than the one in 50
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|I did a test of it and forgot that it was recording... 17 Hours later it was still going...<br /><br />The volume is decent and seems fine for recording a meeting, just don't set your microphone flat on the table.<br /><br /> The playback on it is no good because there is no progress bar, but my phone came with a player that can playback the same format, so this is not really a problem, just a note that you have to switch apps to listen, unless you recorded something short.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I have used kik for months it was a great app until it stopped working on my kindle fire! It wont let e log in or make a new account it works on my friends devices but not mine fix the problem already it hasn't been working for me for nearly a month I even reset my tablet and downloaded it countless times so don't waste your time if you have a kindle
0399255370|5.0|I read this to my son and when we got to poor Peach Crayon... we both died laughing. After I put him to bed I told my bf how much I enjoyed it and he glanced at the first page and was hooked. We sat on the couch and read the whole thing!! Very clever 2 thumbs up!!
B000002L9Y|5.0|I purchased this to replace a very worn out cassette tape. I have played this so much over the years and wanted to not have to stop and turn the tape over anymore. Thanks.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Leave it to the British to do Soap Operas way better than the country that invented them. This show is also a great history lesson,
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This film was so much better that I expected it to be. I love Robin Wilsson but the asian actress got to be my favorite. I love funny teen movies and I will add this to my collection.
B002OSXDAU|3.0|the book was okay it hard read and the ending was a dream. I did get the point of the book how to struggle against incredible odds to get your ideas and products to be accepted in a culture that is corrupted
6305428042|5.0|I ordered this for a throwback movie party. My daughter(22 yrs old) loved this movie back in the day. I've never seen the movie but she has always raved about it. I'm glad I was able to find it here on amazon.
B00E978FGQ|4.0|Loved it! Pretty good movie, even though I watched it with someone who predicted the ending. Definitely something I'd watch again.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria has that off-side glance view of the world like I do. I loved watching this show before it was cancelled. I can never get enough of this dvd and I'm 56 years old!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I've read this trilogy twice and loved it both times. Although the sex scenes were REALLY HOT, the story wasn't all about sex. I loved it because it describes what unconditionally love really is. Can't wait to see the movie.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite Michael Keaton films besides Mr. Mom. This disc has somehow always disappeared from my house. I'[ve bought this film 3-4 times over the years. Thank you amazon.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|My favorite Robin Hood.Again the actors and actresses played their parts and took you back to another time.A true classic,again,without the language,gore,etc. that today's remakes seem to encourage.A different time back then.
B000002LFZ|5.0|I previously had this release on cassette and always loved it because it covered hits from their first up to Tusk. Very good sampling of songs.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Very creative book. What else could you possibly do to people who waste your time???<br /><br />Always kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat until the very end.
B000FBJF3M|5.0|A great read, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Really puts you in the life and times of the people of Pompeii.
B00BMGUIJE|5.0|This is a very nice model, I have nothing to say, but just one sentence I have to tell other fans of one piece---you should buy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008Q08IV4|5.0|I could watch this every month.  Love this show.<br />This is the first film I bought for my new Kindle.<br />great quality and sound.
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|How can this even be called an artist?  Music? talent?  This is horrible.  Our society is going down hill when it comes to good music.
B00B8R1NP0|2.0|Did not like.  Would not read author again.<br /><br />Odd way of writing, almost like he is disconnected from the story.
B00F0AI9Y4|4.0|I love EDM, that being said though so much of it can all seem like more of the same. I love that with this album Avicii worked with people who are clearly not EDM regulars to come up with a great blend of differnt genres of music that don't just sond like more of the same. I can't wait to see what other collaborations they come up with next.
030789701X|5.0|This book is incredible.  The covers look a little cheap, but the paper quality is awesome and the content is extremely comprehensive.  I have found that I don't have to use it much unless I get completely lost or run into a difficult puzzle, but it is definitely worth the money for those that want to get the most out of this game.<br /><br />It is massive, so be prepared for that.  I would say it's about the size and weight of a good hardcover version of The Bible.  The bookmarks make it easier to keep track of things, but it's easy to get lost while playing the game if you're not careful.  Kudos to those who wrote the book and spent the time to make my life easier!
B001NA6096|5.0|We saw that Before Midnight was playing at our local theater. We discovered that there were two prior to It. So we watched this and were thrilled at the way the chemistry flowed between the two actors. The whole movie pivoted around them so they had to be on point for every scene. Not failing in this task, they both captured the essence of what I am sure the writers and director wanted. It was not a phony trumped up Hollywood movie. A sweet old fashioned love story. And also not too long or dragged out so that one is anxious for it to be over. We  will look forward to seeing the second movie in the trilogy, Before sunset.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I am not much of a computer gamer but I have started to play more games on the computer so I wanted to buy a mouse. Although this may be on the pricey end for a first time buyer, I thought if I was going to buy a mouse I might as well buy a good one that will last for a while. So far I have found the mouse to be great for what I paid. The mouse was easy to program, the design looks good, and the design fits nicely for your hand. With the different DPI settings you can change by just clicking a button on the mouse is cool and the cord is quite durable in my opinion. Also the extra little weights given was great because otherwise the mouse would be too light for me. I have been using this mouse for a month so commenting on durability of the mouse would be a bit premature so I will save that for another time. I would recommend this mouse to those who don't want to shell out money for a Razer or the other ridiculously expensive gaming mouses out there.
B000PY52EU|3.0|I did like this movie, warts and all, but there are a lot of warts.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Rae (Christina Ricci) has a flame between her legs that she can't extinguish. Her beau Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is off to the Mid-East to do battle. While he's gone, she gets into trouble and ends up beaten on the side of the road near Lazarus' (Sam Jackson) farm. He takes her in and tries to cure her of her ills.<br /><br />There is a lot of great stuff here. Some really good dialogue with a fine ear for the Southern way of talking. It's also a very good idea for a story. All three of the main characters have demons they need to exorcise, and all end up helping each other. Much attention is paid to the God fearing mentality of the Southern Baptists, but they aren't demeaned. They are believers in the truest sense and respect is given them. This sense of religion underlines much of what happens here. On the bad side, there are some clunky scenes throughout, and they drag down the good stuff. And, though I'm no prude, there was some unnecessarily foul language here, particularly in one song Jackson was performing. The end was also a bit \\"too.\\" but by that time the movie was over so there you have it. Jackson is great. Ricci is about as good as I've seen her and all others do a stand up job. Most of the music is good and the directing is better than average.<br /><br />This is well worth seeing. It just needed a bit of touch up paint here and there.
B003GYEGNO|5.0|I did not expect to enjoy or even finish reading this novel. Instead, I found it a real page-turner and having now at last, about a quarter century after it first appeared, consumed it cover to cover, I concur that it probably belongs on the list of Great American Novels.<br />It centers around a fear that, while seldom in my hearing mentioned, must run deep and widespread in the human spirit: In the pinch, would \\"I\\" be a hit and run driver? This happens to Sherman McCoy, under probably the most aggravated and embarrassing conditions imaginable. These few minutes change his life forever and cause a short-term furor in the life of New York City. How and why other people, including but not limited to an alcohol-sodden British newspaperman working over here, a young assistant D.A., a rabble-rousing preacher, and the investigating detectives, swirl around in this human whirlwind fills over 600 (700 in some editions) gripping pages.<br />The female characters all seem relatively minor and don't come off very well. This failed to annoy my own feminist instincts, because the male characters don't come off very well, either. I didn't much like any of them, which usually kills my interest in a piece of fiction. But, though I didn't really like them, I felt for them. All the viewpoint characters struck me as more or less interchangeable with one another, but this could be Wolfe's point: they also seemed interchangeable with the reader. Wolfe may have drawn only one human mind, but he has drawn that one superlatively well. The characters resemble little individual buttons popping up from that big human mushroom, New York City, itself a microcosm of the world. Only their sets of circumstances vary. Put Sherman McCoy and Larry Kramer in each other's life circumstances, and they would act the same way. In fact, we already see Kramer unconsciously aping McCoy's more prosperous incarnation in the matter of extra-marital relations.<br />What it seems to me Tom Wolfe has done is holdup a mirror to the spirit of humanity. It doesn't give us the most comfortable or comforting reflection, but, seasoned with turns of wry satirical humor in unexpected passages, and ending the way it does -- I will not play the spoiler here -- its cumulative effect was not totally depressing. I surfaced again after the epilogue with the sense that there might possibly be some small grain of hope for us as a species.<br />As a novelist myself, on a far smaller scale, I keenly appreciated Wolfe's control of his material. That he led me, a woman, so thoroughly into the mindset of his male characters (I remember only one short paragraph from a female character's point of view) suggests to me that he might be another of these male authors needlessly buffaloed by \\"the woman's perception,\\" as if we were two different and separate species rather than two human variants with more in common than not.<br />In sum, this is a major achievement, and those who applauded it back in 1987 were entirely right to do so.
B008Y212PI|4.0|A different twist on the cross me games.  Got through the levels too fast - would like to see more pictures!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|An exciting movie, as good as the first two.  Enjoyed it very much but I don't think we need a 4.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|A great family movie! It has laughter for all ages and is a great sequel! I would suggest it for anyone
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I have enjoyed this series all along. It started out interesting and has continued to keep my interest. The story line keeps your interest and the actors do a good job.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|It grows on you the more you listen to it. Great beats, and all around beautiful music to drive around to.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Must read!!!! Kept me reading unable to put the book down. Love the way the story is told and was smiling the whole time
B000YJ85BI|5.0|Excellent but unfinished... 17 moré words required. Majes me want to not evaluate any more books. Is there a forth book?
B004J09ONG|5.0|I first saw this in elementary school, but hadn't seen it since and had completely forgotten it was a true story. I can't even put into words how amazing this story is. It's always a beautiful thing to see a wild animal made free again, but it was even better knowing Elsa never forgot or stopped loving her human parents. Because of people like them our world is a safer place for beautiful creatures such as Elsa.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|it is a great game but i was using my tokens to spawn at the minion beach but it glitched so my game won't work
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Another Zombie flick.  The special effects were great, but I thought it was one of Brad Pitt's weaker performances and the story line was vague.  It was okay as a time waster, but I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it at the theater.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|Easily my favorite show right now, had high expectations after watching the first season, and season two exceeded those expectations!
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I am surprised at how a simple game can be so much fun. It provides various levels of difficulty making the game practically playable by anyone. I've played at least 100 different games on Android and this is definitely in the top 10.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is one of the few games out there that you can get somewhere with out buying items(though you can buy items).  Easy to play as well.
B004H4XDBI|4.0|I liked first book better.. but I loved that we were in his head this time and we have closure.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its really cool. You get to go to places that you see in Despicable Me 2 such as Gur's Lad, Residential Area, El Macho's Lair, and Minion Beach. VERY FUN APP
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|Lots of fun, but seriously, does the hokey-pokey change the world? Some of the energy exercises are quite interesting, as well as the focus ones, but the manifestation ones? What if what you're trying to manifest runs counter to your karma? Who wins, you or the universe?
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Quick read and love the way it's written, switching back and forth from Eleanor and Park's point of view. Good story for people of any age!
B001LRJH0U|5.0|Incredible story.  Perfect acting.  True to life no matter what the genre.  This is a classic that should be appreciated by anyone that loves westerns, integrity, honor, ethics.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|After reading through the book very quickly, enjoying the suspense, I was unhappy with the somewhat abrupt ending. It's an interesting story to read.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Good read, very intense at times. Could not put my kindle down. Read this book in two days. On to the next book
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I almost always fall asleep before the sleep timer runs out. Haven't had any problems yet...May be willing to get the full version.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google is still the best search engine around. As a computer Tech(10 years+) I have yet to use anyone else. Good & fast results.
B00ESNE696|5.0|Great show really enjoyed it.  New season doesn't disappoint.  I highly recommend this show.  Can't wait for more episodes to air.
B0066WJLU6|1.0|Doesn't do anything on a Kindle Fire HD, thought it would at least work as the full screen flashlight, but nothing ever loads.
B00ESGYQWA|5.0|This is quite possibly the best adaption of a Shakespeare play I have ever seen. The setting, blocking, and directing were all brilliant. I've been impressed with Joss Whedon's work before, but this took it to a whole new level. Much Ado About Nothing is one of my favorite plays of all time and I felt that this version of it, beyond doing it justice, opened up new interpretations and ideas to me. The casting is brilliant. Amy Acker was brilliant in the main role, and Alexis Denisof playing opposite her had a great understanding of his character. I've been a longtime fan of Nathan Fillion and was very please with his work in this role. Clark Gregg was perfect for his role, and Christop Crane proved he had what it takes for an emotional role.<br />I'd recommend this to all fans of Shakespeare, and anyone who's looking for a classic Romantic Comedy and is willing to deal with the middle English, which I personally love.
B003J27WFW|5.0|An awesome video of 1 of my favorite bands.  Rush shows us why they are 1 of the best performers !!
B00340O3KQ|5.0|A must watch film! When you have John Travolta and Nicolas Cage together you get a mastermind production! It was so good that I didnt want it to end. They need to make more movies in this genre like this.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This is my son's favorite band, always a perfect present for him at any holiday, or birthday present!!  Thank you!!
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Not a very good movie. Cheap plot and terrible acting. Typical boring story line with nothing exciting or out of the usual.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great movie & excellent action.  Completely fun for the kids & whole family to enjoy.  Exciting & always entertaining acting!!

B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Om Nom is so cute, of course you want to feed him candy! You feel bad when you miss his mouth and he's sad. Very fun to play for the whole family. I know, sounds cliche, but it's true because it is a cute game. Enough challenge for grown-ups and easy enough to keep the little ones from being frustrated.

0385536828|3.0|From time to time it's worth working out how many books might yet be read in what remains of our potential lifespan. Given this number is finite and diminishing fast, I strongly recommend you don't give up any of your available reading choice to 'Sweet Tooth.' There's nothing particularly awful about the book, other than it fails to achieve depth in either subject matter or character. In short, the book's MI5 component made me want to pick up Le Carre; the social and political references made me yearn for David Peace and the supposed understated irony reminded me to revisit the master of the genre: Henry James.<br /><br />One day I hope someone will pull together a volume of Ian McEwan's finest moments, and in it will appear the first chapter of Enduring Love, the opening sequence of Child in Time, all of The Cement Garden and selected highlights from Atonement. Clearly, this author is a genius at times, though not all the time, and certainly not in 'Sweet Tooth.'
B006ATJXQW|3.0|Entertaining read. Not as good as other books that I've read where several years later I remember the characters names and think about the story.
B00DWFQ2N4|4.0|Releasing two albums in one year is always going to be a risky move. In fact, releasing a sequel album in general is risky business because the inevitable comparisons will be made to the original release. However, Justin Timberlake managed to make it work even when his latest effort seemed set-up for failure. Releasing just six months after The 20/20 Experience, 2 of 2 finds itself being the polar opposite of its predecessor. While The 20/20 Experience had Justin experimenting with a new, maturer sound, this second offering finds him drawing inspiration from each of his three previous albums. To say the end result is good would be a huge understatement.<br /><br />I'll admit, going into this album I had some pretty low expectations. I really enjoyed \\"Take Back the Night\\", but I wasn't too fond of \\"TKO\\". To top it off, he had not one, but two guests on here -- both of which I dislike with passion. Also, The 20/20 Experience wasn't an instant-hit with me and I was worried the same was going to happen with the sequel. It didn't take long before all those worries were washed away, though. Within minutes I found myself sucked in. This latest album is fueled with a raw energy that was undeniably absent from his last effort and I was loving it.<br /><br />One thing I truly loved about this album was the way it was organized. The first half has all the fun, energetic songs, while the latter half has all the darker material. For example, \\"True Blood\\" is like an energy drink on crack, but then you have \\"Only When I Walk Away\\" which is easily one of the most heartfelt songs on the entire album. Both fantastic pieces of music in their own right, but both have very different objectives. What's so great about it, though, is that the album slowly declines from this fun experience to one that's very emotional. So it never feels like a drastic or uncomfortable change.<br /><br />Another thing I noticed was how seamless the transitions were from one song to the next. It was almost asif these songs were specifically made to be arranged in this order. While this element slowly became less noticeable as time went on, it was still impressive because it made the album feel like a cohesive piece of music instead of a bunch of songs shoved together at random. It may not be something that's noticed, or appreciated, by everyone, but as a music enthusiast I loved it.<br /><br />It should be noted that \\"TKO\\" did grow on me after a few listens. While it may not be one of the most impressive songs on the album, it also isn't the worst. No, that title would be reserved for track eight, \\"You Got It On\\". Still, even that may be a bit of an overstatement. Truthfully, it's not that it's necessarily a bad song, it's just the only song on the entire album that feels out of place. I personally couldn't find a proper spot for it anywhere on here, but placing it between \\"Drink You Away\\" and \\"Amnesia\\" was a terrible decision on Timberlake's part.<br /><br />In addition, I was also annoyed by the two guests I mentioned earlier. The 20/20 Experience saw Jay-Z as the only guest on the main album with two others on the bonus songs. Well Jay-Z returns with another verse on track six, \\"Murder\\", and accompanying him is Drake on track three, \\"Cabaret\\". Now I'm not one of those people who complains for the sake of complaining. Regardless of whether or not I liked these emcees, if they had a good verse then they had a good verse, but both of their contributions were godawful. Not only did they disrupt the flow of the songs they appeared on, but their lyrics were laughable at best. Truthfully, I couldn't come up with any logical reason for including them on the album at all. I would have preferred all of the attention to be on Timberlake himself.<br /><br />The only other minor issue I had was the length of some of these songs. The first volume of this two-part album had some lengthy pieces as well and I was fine with that. However, while they were long, they were long becausethey had a purpose. Most of the songs on 2 of 2 seemed dragged out just for the sake of making the song longer. There seems to be no concrete reason and there's no real deviation from the original concept. It's just an empty beat with him reciting pieces of the hook over-and-over again. It added a feeling of redundancy that wasn't present on any of his previous releases.<br /><br />Finally, if you reach the end of the hidden song \\"Pair of Wings\\" -- which is arguably the most beautiful song on the entire album -- and find yourself wanting more, there is a deluxe edition which has two bonus songs. While I wasn't too impressed with the bonus material on the original album, the two found on here are very, very good. They actually do a great job of expanding on the album's sound while still making themselves worthy additions to the tracklist. Definitely recommend you go for the deluxe edition -- available only at Target -- if you're looking to check this out.<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"True Blood,\\" \\"Drink You Away\\" & \\"Only When I Walk Away\\"<br /><br />Overall Score: 8.6/10 - Releasing two very strong albums in one year is no small feat. While I do love The 20/20 Experience, part of me feels like this sequel has a bit of an edge due to its diversity. It is both fun and serious, but, at the same time, it is equally flawed. I'm glad to see a lot of focus is going back into his music and I can't wait to hear what he does in the future.
B00DK9FNLY|4.0|Love the game, reaction time spot on, no lag, you can use extreme English on the shots, just like the real thing, just trying to figure out, what finger to use, for best results
B00013AXEE|5.0|I checked out this book at the library and renewed it 3 times, then I went and bought it.  I love this book and find it interesting and informative.  I loved reading about Stephen King and how he started writing books.  Nice to see he actually struggled like everyone else and was also rejected.  I take this book everywhere I go because I always get the most interesting comments.  People always want to know if this book is scary and I say, it is about writing not a novel.  I am new to writing  and I find this book very helpful.  One of the most important tips for me is when he talks about the back story.  I can not tell a story even to my friends without thinking about the back story and how long it should be.  I usually read about 2 or 3 books a month, mostly fiction.  A friend of mine asked me recently what was the best book I ever read, this is one of them.  [[ASIN:B009BDVD2Q On Writing - A Memoir Of The Craft]]
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Excellent story line full of details and sections that are not in the tv series. I've actually read the book series and find that it truly envelopes the world Martin has created in a way that pulls the reader completely in. Fantastic reading and hard to put down.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I decided to read this book, one because of the fact that I haven't read it. And two, because my curiosity behind the psychology of it was overwhelming. Regardless of writing style...take a long hard look at the underlying story. What makes a female want to write about BDSM?  An internal fascination or a mere honest impression of a girl trying to bring her troubled lover out of the dark side? I found myself enjoying the happy and care free moments in the book, of course the sex scenes were out there but what do you expect? Books are usually meant to be outlandish. And of course, I chuckled and said to myself, the theme is so obvious. \\"You never know until you try\\" at its very best.<br />Writers are brave to put their stories out there. Don't like it? Fine. Move on. For those truly curious about this book, you never know until you try. (;

B00BAXFAOW|3.0|The biblical story of David and Goliath is a story of courage but also of overestimating strengths and misunderstanding the power of playing a different game to make the person who seems weakest be victorious.<br /><br />In the face improbable odds, finding themselves inferior in scale, ability or resources is what pushes certain people to try things out of the ordinary, re-think the rules and play a different strategy - which is a formula for winning. This book makes the point in the story of Bedouins, David and Goliath and the underdog basketball team that goes undefeated.<br /><br />Malcolm invites us to challenge the assumption that bigger is better. One of his key points is that when you are too big , too good, too strong - you advantage starts becoming a disadvantage. He challenges us to re-think our assumptions of what is good, what is bad, what is a strength, and what is an advantage. He points out that disadvantages can be advantages and that difficulties can produce resiliency and courage.<br /><br />The central line is about the power of being different, becoming the big fish in a small pond that you create rather than being a small fish in a large pond - like the impressionists, who created their own pond, went against the current, and converted their weakness into strength.<br /><br />Adversity has the potential to make us much stronger, more resilient and courageous - when it does not crush us. People who have gone through difficult times tend to think different, challenge the status quo, and take the bold chances that people who have had it easy have not had the need or the guts to do. Those who re-think the rules and take a new road are the people who change the world.<br /><br />The second part of the book is about the idea that if you are Goliath, if you are in a position of strength, trying to dominate the Davids by force can be counterproductive. Authority requires legitimacy. The book talks about stories from MLK to religious clashes in Ireland to make the point.<br /><br />As you expect from Malcom, the stories are very interesting, enjoyable and even captivating.  Yet, at the end of the day the book does not leave you with a set of powerful ideas that you have not heard before. The story of David and Goliath is thousands of years old and has been told many times.<br /><br />I did not find this book as intellectually stimulating as some of his previous books that have left me with a new way of thinking and have provided a foundation for more ideas to be built upon, like the Tipping Point or Blink. I can recommend this as an enjoyable read but not a breakthrough.to make the point.<br /><br />As you expect from Malcom, the stories are very interesting, enjoyable and even captivating.

0812982622|5.0|I finished this book several weeks ago, and it has taken me several weeks to sit down and process my thoughts into a coherent review!<br /><br />Pak Jun Do, who is an orphan master's son, is a citizen of North Korea. While he lives in a country that brainwashes its people into believing they are citizens of the greatest democratic nation in the world, Jun Do sees past the propoganda and recognizes that he and his fellow citizens are slaves to their leader Kim Jung Il. As Jun Do gains attention from Kim Jung Il, he begins a dangerous attempt to move into the inner circle of North Korea's government and save the woman that he loves.<br /><br />Like most people, I knew very little about North Korea before reading this novel. I recognize that this is a fictional story, but it does seem to be a story that is based on research and some facts, along with the author's imagination. I found it fascinating and horrifying all at the same time. And it makes me want to read and learn more about North Korea and what life is like for people in that country. I think this novel is worth reading just because it opened my eyes to a part of the world that I had never before considered.<br /><br />But it is also worth reading because it is just a great novel! I loved the tone of the novel. While it is about some horrible, horrible real life conditions, there is an undertone of satire and dark humor to Johnson's writing. And it worked really well in this novel. The things that are happening in North Korea are just absurd and often appear silly when read from an American perspective. It is almost laughable. Except it's not, because it is real.<br /><br />So while this does read like political satire, it is also a thriller and even a little bit of a love story. I read in an interview with Adam Johnson that he wanted to portray what life is like for the regular every day person in North Korea. What is it like to be a parent, a spouse, a friend in a country that controls your every movement? Through Jun Do's journey, I felt like we got a picture of all those things.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this novel. I give it a solid five starsThrough Jun Do's journey, I felt like we got a picture of all those things.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this novel. I give it a solid five stars

He finds ways to use his talents and now it is time for him to &#34;pay his debt&#34; by helping another child and going back to Colorado to stand up to his fears.  The only problem with this book is that I read it too fast.  I got the audible edition as well, so that I could go through it again.  This is the Stephen King I used to know, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading/listening to this compelling and very satifying story.

B000FCKC4C|4.0|I am not sure what to think... this book was a rare one for me.. I am a firm believer of following your heart and you get what you give, meaning always be nice and look for the best solution to things which this book has but I do not believe at all that our lives are already written.. I agree with making certain choices will get you to a certain place in your life but not that your whole life has been decided already. I know that the book does not say that 100 percent but it's kind of implied.. over all great book..
B004I4H8QS|5.0|This remaster is a huge improvement over my previous version, the 20th anniversary edition. Everything seems well defined, considering the \\"wall of sound\\" methods that were used, similar to Harrison's All Things Must Pass. Of course before my 20th Anniv. edition I had the original 1970 ATCO cassette, on Ampex tape, upon which surgery had been performed several times, particularly on the silly foam pressure pad.... This new disc played on a high-end modern system is beautiful!

055358202X|3.0|Just finished this fourth book and am very dissatisfied. I was hoping for some more closure on more of the threads. I found myself skipping over lots of pages when the story was too detailed with too many new characters. Too many of the bad guys seemed to be winning. With the author's note at the end that the fifth book would have a lot about the dragon queen, that sealed it for me. She started out as an interesting character but got boring along the way. I like medieval tales in books and movies but I'm done with this throne series. If anyone can recommend something like that I'd appreciate it.

B001G5ZKZS|3.0|Rush is one of the world's premiere acts and their virtuouso musicianship deserves all the accolades the band has received since the 1970s. This DVD (I have it on blu ray) should have it all - the band captured live at a peak of their career, stellar stage production, lighting design, superb sound and all in HD. But the direction and editing isn't up to the same standards. 3 second shots and botched camera cues abound; countless times the directors miss the beginning of a solo or cut away at the critical moment, leaving another virtuouso moment in a tiny corner of the frame. It left me wondering if the directors had even heard the songs before taking the job. Without a doubt this is Rush live at their very best, it's a shame the direction wasn't.
B001O3UJ8K|5.0|I gave this album five stars because I love Nine Inch Nails and I love this album. This album may not be for some &#34;traditional&#34; NIN fans but this album has Trent Reznor's heart in it as most of his songs do. I believe that if you are a fan of Trent and/or NIN but you haven't heard this then you should give it a spin. In order to fully understand the beauty of the album then you must like this genre and probably like Nine Inch Nails. I would highly recommend this album to anybody who is a NIN fan who hasn't heard this and to those who are even trying to get into this genre more or even those who want to expand the music base. Reznor is almost a poetic hero in the sense that when listening to this album you can completely dive into the madness of NIN but when the music ends you may find yourself trying to crawl back in. Truly is a poetic beauty of music in which it can feel like madness and apocalyptic but also strangely comfortable and peaceful.

B008476HBM|5.0|One of the best classics ever written! The relationships in this story have inspired so many other &#34;continuations&#34;.  It's always popular.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I like the game but when I reached a certain level, cant remember, it took me right back to the beginning.  Not amused. Deleted it from my kindle
B00A285OOW|5.0|It is well written. It tells one of my favorite periods history from the woman's point of view. It is about court intrigue.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this app. It is sort of like Temple Run, but better. It is sooo fun and I love when they have different places. You can have different people and collect hoverboards from different states. The only thing i dont like is the annoying adds that show up right before you play. PLEASE FIX!!!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Very impressed. Used it camping and it proved to be great tool. I used the Schrade to split wood and as a striker with a fire steel. It performed as promised. Thanks!
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Not their best book, but I have read practically everything they have written. This book was definitely entertaining but at times moved very slowly with excess subplots and prolonged descriptions. None the less, the story line was reasonably creative and some of the mystery of Constance Green is resolved .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|REVIEWED BY SUNNY<br /><br />I was nervous to read HOPELESS as I hadn't had the best experience with my only read to date in the New Adult genre. However, in the genres that I typically love, I have also read some books I haven't liked, so I had to give this genre another chance. The summary for HOPELESS had me thinking this would be a good one to try.<br /><br />When I started this book, I immediately thought, Oh no, here we go again! The issues I had with the other book I'd read in this genre were in the forefront of this book too, and I assumed I wasn't going to like it at all. In fact, I almost gave up on it. But because I was reviewing it for the blog, I decided to read a little bit more before giving up completely. Boy, am I glad I did! Once I got further into the book, it was nothing like my other experience with New Adult and I couldn't put it down! Let me tell you why...<br /><br />Colleen Hoover has an incredible talent with character development. The complex characters in HOPELESS have unbelievable stories to tell. Their past and present are very intriguing, and with the details Hoover uses in her writing, I was really able to get to know them all intimately.<br /><br />When first introduced to Sky, she was difficult to like. The book was written from her point of view, and her thoughts and feelings were well developed throughout the story, but she seemed to lack self-confidence. She allowed people to think things about her that weren't true and didn't stick up for herself. This was hard for me to relate to. However, her sense of humor started to take over. Then, she went on a journey of rediscovery and it became hard not to fall completely in love with her! In this journey, she started to see herself differently and experienced many firsts as she found herself and a new love.<br /><br />Dean Holder (who goes by Holder) was the handsome, dark, and mysterious hero. He was NOT your typical eighteen-year-old! He has had an emotional past that causes his temper to flare. When his temper was in check, he was an incredible young man. Hoover created a passionate, thoughtful character in Holder, and he proved himself time and time again throughout the story. It became apparent why he had a temper, but at the same time, I related to his soft side and understood why he could be the complete opposite--a young man in control of his emotions and capable of so much love!<br /><br />Sky and Holder had issues that needed to be dealt with, as did the secondary characters, which added to the depth of the story. Sky's mom, Brenda, and her best friend, Six, each bring different elements to the plot that helped me see the main characters fully. These characters are going to stay with me for a long time, and I have already started reading LOSING HOPE, the second book in this series, because I wanted more of Sky and Holder! Speaking of more, I am thrilled to be getting it, as both books have been optioned for film. I am not going to miss them!<br /><br />As much as I disliked how the book started, it actually led to absolute brilliance! I loved how everything came together in the end. Hoover couldn't have surprised me more with her plotting. The story was driven by a timeline that was mostly in the present, but took some important glimpses into the past. The cadence created by these visits between the past and present was excellent. It was what got me excited to continue to turn the pages to learn more. I also loved how the story involved suspense. I kept wondering what all of the details meant; meanwhile, Hoover would introduce another element that would get me one step closer to the clarity desired. As one of my fellow bloggers says, it was amazeballs!<br /><br />I loved the symbolism utilized throughout the book. It added such a nice touch to this beautiful story of young love and self-discovery! I was thankful for the journey Hoover took me on to understand why there is such a sense of hopelessness for everyone involved. And finally,I loved how she concluded the journey with incredible discoveries.<br /><br />I am so thankful I didn't give up on this one early on just because I had a bad experience with a different New Adult book. HOPELESS ended up being nothing like my former read. Instead, it gave me a fresh perspective on this genre that will keep me hoping for more just like it. As a matter of fact, HOPELESS may rank up there as one of my top reads of 2013!<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />HOPELESS is a journey into self-discovery and young love with a beautifully characterized heroine and hero. If you are like me and haven't enjoyed the New Adult genre in the past, this one may change your mind. It is a beautiful romantic and suspenseful story that had me turning the pages to get the clarity I needed to fully understand these amazing characters.<br /><br />RATING: AI loved how she concluded the journey with incredible discoveries.<br /><br />I am so thankful I didn't give up on this one early on just because I had a bad experience with a different New Adult book.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|Good story, slow at first but kept interesting until the very end .  When one makes a life changing decision , ones mind cannot be persuaded otherwise
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I had never heard of this book or Gaiman but I heard a discussion involving him on a BBC broadcast. According to the moderator, Gaiman's book was the number one choice when listeners were asked what book they would most like to have discussed on the air.  I was fascinated by the variety of people who had read and were captivated by the book, and I was interested in the premise, so I bought it.  I am not a big fantasy fan, but I love a good story and this is definitely one.  The characters are captivating, the philosophy is engaging and I found myself enjoying the mysterious comings and goings.  Great fun with a sobering message.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Nice story, some things were predictable. I wouldn't call it a page turner but I did want to finish it.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|This is an extraordinary film combining great scenario and incredible visual effects, made by THE great master of Japanese cinema. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: This is the review of Criterion Collection: Kagemusha [2-DVD] [1980]<br /><br />\\"Kagemusha\\" is the story of just three years of the incredible but true and short but extremely intense saga of Takeda clan. The period of great importance of Takeda was in years 1536-1582, but this film tells just the story of the dramatic years 1573 to 1575, from the siege of Noda castle to battle of Nagashino. In order to better understand the events described in \\"Kagemusha\\" it is helpful to know the main events of the history of the Takeda clan in the previous years, as they are ocassionally referred to, but not fully explained.<br />-----<br />In 1536 Takeda Nobutora, the head of Takeda clan, was the daimyo of impoverished mountainous province of Kai. But not only was this province a dirt poor backwater, but the Takeda didn't even really control of all it, as some of their nominal retainers, like the Hirada family, were in fact completely independent. Therefore the Takeda were really just a little, not very wealthy provincial samurai clan, without much importance. In 1536 Takeda Nobutora lost an important battle against the Hirada family, but soon after Takeda Harunobu, his then barely 15-years old son, avenged the defeat and destroyed completely the Hirada, greatly stregthening the position of his clan.<br /><br />That great achievement notwithstanding, there was not much love between father and son and Harunobu, although being the oldest son, was not designed as heir - that position went to his younger brother Nobushige instead. Refusing this, Takeda Harunobu in 1541 seized the power and banished his father. Both his younger brothers decided to stay in Kai and remain loyal to Harunobu - when \\"Kagemusha\\" begins, Nobushige was already dead (see below) but second brother, Nobukado, is one the main characters in the film. Takeda Nobuzane, his half-brother, who was still a child at that moment, also was going to serve him loyally once fully grown up.<br /><br />The new leader was very ambitious and even if he had now all the Kai under his control he immediately attacked other daimyos from the neighboring province of Shinano, destroying first the Murakami clan. His next target as the Suwa clan, which was comprehensively defeated in 1542 - their leader, Suwa Yorishige, was taken prisoner and later murdered. Of all the Suwa clan only the daughter of Suwa Rorishige survived (we don't know her name - she is known only as Princess Suwa) - impressed by her beauty Takeda Harunobu took her as a concubine and she gave him his favorite son, Takeda Katsuyori, who is another important character in the film.<br /><br />Having completed the conquest of Shinano province and having signed the alliance with the powerful Imagawa daimyo of Suruga, young Harunobu beacame a very famous and powerful warlord - from that moment he was called \\"The Tiger of Kai\\". It was at that moment, that encouraged by his main strategist, Yamamoto Kansuke, he had made a new war banner, under which the Takeda clan would fight from now on - and which would become a legend in its own. This banner was called \\"Furin Kazan\\", from characters signifying \\"Wind, Forest, Fire, Mountain\\" and the flag itself carried the inscription taken from Sun Tzu's writings, precising the characteristics necessary for a great general: \\"Fast as the wind, silent as the forest, ardent as the fire, calm as the mountain\\".<br /><br />His next target was the province of Echigo and its young lord Nagao Kagetora, who had the particularity of being not only an exceptionnal warrior but also a buddhist monk, better known under his religious name Uesugi Kenshin and also called \\"The Dragon of Echigo\\". The long confrontation between the \\"Tiger of Kai\\" and \\"Dragon of Echigo\\" lasted 14 years, roughly from 1550 to 1564, fightingno less than five battles at the Kawanakajima plain!<br /><br />In 1559 Takeda Harunobu decided to become himself a novice Buddhist monk and took a new name - from that moment on he was known as Takeda Shingen.<br /><br />The culmination of the confrontation between those two warlords was the fourth battle of Kawanakajima, in 1561, in which at one moment Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin fought one against other, swords in hand! Takeda Shingen was wounded during this fight - as you will see, the scar from this wound plays an important role in \\"Kagemusha\\" plot. The battle itself however was a draw - Uesugi Kenshin lost more soldiers (4000 against 3000 for the Takeda clan) but he could withdraw without being bothered by exhausted enemies. The Takeda clan lost also two precious generals - the famous strategist Yamamoto Kansuke and Shingen's loyal younger brother, Takeda Nobushige.<br /><br />Realizing that his fight against Uesugi Kenshin is a dead end, Takeda Shingen made ultimately peace with his old nemesis in 1564. Uesugi Kenshin appears briefly in \\"Kagemusha\\" without being openly named - you will recognize him by his impressive monastic clothes and the buddhist rosary he always held in hands. Both warlords needed peace because a new power was rising in Japan - Oda Nobunaga, the terrifying and somehow extravagant daimyo of Owari, who apears a lot in \\"Kagemusha\\" (including a greatly hilarious scene in which he and his guest taste some Portuguese wine or like they call it \\"barbarian sake\\"...).<br /><br />In 1560 Oda Nobunaga greatly weakened the powerful Imagawa clan from Suruga by winning the battle of Okehazama. Seeing that Suruga province was now ripe for picking, Takeda Shingen betrayed his Imagawa allies and finally seized this precious land in 1569. The Takeda clan was now a major power and one of two top pretenders to the control over all Japan. The only rival of the Takeda was the alliance between Oda Nobunaga and a young daimyo from Mikawa, a certain Matsudaira Takechiyo, who in 1567 changed his name and became Tokugawa Ieyasu - this latter famous character also appears in \\"Kagemusha\\"...<br /><br />In 1567 Takeda Yoshinobu, Shingen's oldest son by his wife, Lady Sanjo, rebelled against his father resenting his favouritism towards Katsuyori. Easily defeated, Yoshinobu was forced by his father to commit seppuku.<br /><br />After defeating Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu in some minor engagements and in the major battle at Mikatagahara on 25 January 1573, he then besieged, at the end of January 1573 the castle of Noda defended by 500 samurai and ashigaru loyal to Tokugawa. This is AT THAT MOMENT THAT \\"Kagemusha\\" BEGINS - and I will not say much more about the action of the film.<br />---------------------<br /><br />\\"Kagemusha\\" means \\"the shadow warrior\\" and in feudal Japan was the word designing the decoys used by some warlords to impersonate them in various occasions, to avoid risks of assasination or to let them recover in peace from sickness or simply to allow them to catch a moment of rest during the campaign... The use of \\"kagemushas\\" was a common practice and it gave of course occasion to some wild rumors - according to some of them, Tokugawa Ieyasu himself was supposedly killed at the second siege of Osaka in 1615 and during the following 12 months was replaced by a decoy, the time that his power is safely transmitted to his son (that story is almost certainly NOT true). In our times the decoys are also used - the most famous was certainly Clifton James, a simple solider who for a time impersonated Montgomery, in order to deceive Axis intelligence services...<br /><br />This film tells the story of a fictitious \\"kagemusha\\", as Takeda Shingen was not known for using one. Both Shingen and his double are played by the great Japanese actor Tatsuya Nakadai - and as always, he does a great job. Other important characters are Takeda Nobukado (Shingen's younger brother), Takeda Katsuyori (Shingen's favourite son) and Takemaru (real name Takeda Nobukatsu), Shingen's grandson, aged 5 at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />Takeda Shingen was famous for gathering around him 24 excellent commanders, known as Twenty Four Generals of the Takeda. In 1573, when the film begins, many were already dead, so in this film we see only seven of them, including Takeda Nobukado. The most important character amongst them is Yamagata Masakage, the old man with red face. Two other real generals I managed to identify were Hara Masatane and Naito Masatoyo. Those are the three generals who at one moment cross their lances together, in an extremely powerful scene towards the end of the film.<br /><br />Other than the scenario, which is excellent, as always in Kurosawa films, the great treasure of this film are the images. Samurai armies are impressive, battles are even better and the sequences of the dreams (or rather nightmares) are very powerful.<br /><br />The final scenes of the great battle of Nagashino are of course a very beautiful thing from the artistic point of view, but the REAL battle was absolutely NOT such a one sided affair as it is pictured. Kurosawa needed to adapt this battle to obtain a Wagnerian finale and also there is no question that this battle ended with a great disaster for one of the sides - but still, in real history, things went VERY differently from what we see in \\"Kagemusha\\".<br /><br />On another hand, the character of Oda Nobunaga is IMPRESSIVELY good! In this film he appears really as a warlord for whom thousands would be ready to rise, fight - and die.<br /><br />The film doesn't say (sorry SPOILER coming) what would happen later to three of the most important characters, Takeda Nobukado, Takeda Katsuyori and little Takemaru (yes, here is the SPOILER - they survive to the final credits). And honestly I would advise you to NOT research this question before watching \\"Kagemusha\\". Do it after. Believe me, it is a good advice.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: this film is a masterpiece; it lasts 3 hours but at the end you will only feel sorry that there is no more; a film to buy, watch, keep and re-watch.

B000003BZ4|5.0|So if you are not familiar with Gov't Mule you are missing out on one great blues/rock band.  Was very happy with this and highly recommend to any music fan.
B00C5R8364|3.0|An average read. Unsophisticated and simplistic. Nothing challenging about the story. Other Forsyth books are much better. I was expecting better.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Terrific writing, great character development, solid plot lines, well done!  Grabs one's attention from the start and keeps one engaged until the end.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I love Fire Maple Games. They are imaginative, thought provoking and just complex enough to keep you thinking about how to solve the puzzles even when you are away from the app.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Can't go wrong with this one - good fun, action, humor, an interesting take on the original version of the story from 30 years ago.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I can't believe the Disney business heads would abandon a franchise with such a great start. I take that back, they haven't understood their audience for many years now. I was excited at 1st, like the Rockateer , I was hoping for the next installment. They should advertise a re-release into the theaters like the Lion King but maybe that still failed? :-) Ok, maybe not, and that is the point. It's not too late to stand by this one. Original Disney productions don't really seem to get the backing, but then why work yourself when you can just buy someone else's work. 'These aren't the movies you are looking for.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|The drama here is just incredible - of course you have the zombies, a villain to absolutely loathe but you have some (a little) sympathy for, interesting interplay between the main characters.  The producers and writers take chances with this show like very few others, and it pays off big-time.  This is the best show on TV, of any genre.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Best mobile game ever in my opinion, but it does eventually have a point where you've won the game over a few dozen times and have tried every combination of how to win.  Once it hits that point, there is nothing to do with it.  Still awesome though.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Very disappointing. Not sure what the author had in mind when he digressed into every character's past other than highlighting how the war effected them. May have been better if written as a series of short stories. I had to get my bearings at the beginning of each chapter, reading several pages before I knew which character he was talking about and in which timeframe;  very distracting and it unnecessary slowed down the narrative.
B004EBZX6W|2.0|I tried it out, and while it seemed to have a good interface and lots of good stuff to try with it, in the end, the results were not accurate for me.  for example, it showed no signal, yet my laptop was still able to connect and bandwidth was good enough to stream YouTube.  So I don't know what to say except that it was pretty worthless in the end...
B007URVZJ6|3.0|I liked the book and thought it was precise and helpful in down loading a book to Kindle. Instructions were good.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Well done interesting subjects. Good humor. Good script. Fast moving.  Deals with moral and social issues. Shows attorneys greed. Recommend watching.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Porn is like photography in that its depiction of its subject illustrates the breadth of the artist's vision as much as the  reality of the subject. Add to that any limitations in the beholders' vision and the problems that James faced are outlined. This book is what I expected when I bought it, after all, what can one expect from a mix of chick-lit and porn? It is worth what I paid for the kindle edition, but why anyone should want to fork out for a hard copy edition is beyond my limited understanding.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|I have only recently become a Margaret Atwood fan.  I love science fiction, alternate reality and books of that genre.  My first experience with this author was &#34;The Handmaids Tale&#34;, and I must admit I was instantly hooked on the narrative style of writing.  A few of the phrases in this book were a bit overused, but all in all... I loved the story.  The book leaves a satisfying end to the trilogy, But I feel that there is also room to expand upon the story should she so desire in the future.  I would not mind a few more books set in this universe, but if MaddAddam is the end, I can certainly feel as though the story has been completed.<br /><br />If you are reading this review as a consideration to purchase the book... do yourself a favor and make sure to read the first two prior to embarking on this one.  There is just so much backstory in those books which makes this one all the more satisfying.
B00E7PQVHK|5.0|awsome game, even had to get it for my phone, it even starts you off slow and gets much harder later on....
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We use this at our house to steam Netflix from our computer and iPad to our TV.  We also use it to play some youtube videos.  We have installed Chrome onto our computers...this works through Chrome (not our other browsers)...to the doodad.  Our TV has an HDMI port and a USB port.  Installation was a breeze.<br /><br />There is a small delay between what is playing on our computer and what shows on the TV we play it on.  The sound transfers with the video.  Only once, has the sound been off from the picture on the TV.  We re-started and it worked fine after that.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love the whole plot of the storyline, keeps you wanting more.<br />On to the next book, while my fifteen year son awaits for this one and I have no shame on letting him read it either, wish my husband would.
B00FEN1C50|3.0|There wasn't anything wrong with it, per se, but I have to admit I got pretty lost about halfway through. Not because it was too complicated, but because there was barely any plot there. Thank goodness the cast and director were so talented, or it would've gotten 1 star. The effects were great, and the cheekiness was appreciated, but I felt like most of the emotion was a little forced.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game. The only problem(s) I had were that before you go into the game it has adds that randomly pop up and bring you to there website. The other problem was that it erased all my progress on my account that I had. I got a new Kindle Fire and it erased all of it!!!! Same account and everything. Otherwise I would reccomend this game to anyone.
B009HEMJCW|5.0|A lovely movie infused with comedy, style, and some great acting gives depth to this simple, but v. important story. Aesop would be happy with this almost-fable.
B003ZMF26W|5.0|Very good quality materials, ergonomics and user-friendly software interface.<br />I recommend to buy this mouse to everyone who plays in the strategy or shooters. And she copes with programs such as Photoshop, etc.
B00F0XATY4|5.0|Initially reluctant about the price, disks 3 and 4 (the actual New Year's Eve concert) changed my mind by displaying all facets of the Band, power, subtlety, humor, feeling and memory.  Really captures a group unlike any of its peers, playing for itself, belonging in the fraternity of great bands of the past (Ray Charles Live)but also traveling forward, i.e., creating something new and special, not copying or imitating. I will never tire of a Band that can play Rockin Chair as if their whole world was one of the guys' living rooms and also explode into Chest Fever on the same night.  And, as the Dylan set demonstrates, the only musicians Dylan ever treated as equal partners onstage - he is even deferring to the Band letting them sing and play as they intuitively do in the open spaces.  The sound is incredible, I can hear the piano practically bouncing off of Richard Manuel's fingers and Garth Hudson's magic all over.  The set, especially because the Stage Fright and the Cahoots songs are played better than in studio, renders those albums non-essential.  With Live at the Academy, the three essential studio albums are The Basement Tapes, Music from Big Pink and The Band, and the others can be left out despite some great songs because these efforts are timeless.  Add Live 1966 and The Last Waltz and one can also hear what the Hawks created with Dylan and what a great backing band they were.  The  IOW set on the Essential Self Portrait, the 3 cuts from the Woody Guthrie Memorial and Before the Flood can also show the wizardry of The Band with Dylan during different phases.  In all, an amazing body of work in too short a period of time!

B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|Engrossing Show. Netflix did something special here...I waited for the DVDs. Anxiously ! Kevin Spacey rocks the role. The only reason I gave it four stars is that I don't like any of the characters. Somehow that didn't bother me in the British version. I can't imagine anyone not appreciating this show. Well done Netflix!
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|This is my favorite show on television. Witty sitcom and very well written. I recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh.
B008JFUNYG|2.0|The original movie from 1981 was made with a zesty energy and enthusiasm that belied its shoestring budget, resulting in a fun, inventive, campy-scary cult classic. As usual for remakes, they threw in lots more money, lots more gore, and cloistered it within an atmosphere of deadly seriousness. What they left out: any sense of fun, verve, humor, purpose. To these eyes it's strictly DOA. The worst part: like Wes Craven lending a hand to the soulless remake of his early 70's grindhouse classic The Last House on the Left a few years ago, Sam Raimi (the writer/director of the original) and Bruce Campbell (the original's inimitable star) were responsible in producing this. The end result is not exactly a desecration but simply a typical Remake Bummer nonetheless. Some people just can't leave well enough alone.

1401917232|2.0|I loved his first book, The Disappearance of the Universe. I had studied the Course years ago and this brought me back into it. The second book was a disappointment, too much of Gary's ego and not enough of the Course. I had hopes for this book. It started out very well, giving a great overview of the Course in Miracles. Then it wandered off into the conspiracies theories. OK, I could go along with that. Then about half way through the book when he began to promote his vitamin supplements, that lost me. No, Gary. I've put the book away and given up on you. I still like the DU and feel it is a positive contribution to the Course, but it ends there. I forgive you, but it's over.

B00E0F9J44|5.0|Stacey Kent and her husband Jim Tomlinson have done it again. After a series of nine superb albums featuring Stacey's beautiful, instantly recognizable voice with its appealing girlish tone and Tomlinson's tasty sax playing, she has, on The Changing Lights, turned her attention to the music of Brazil, in particular bossa nova. And a great album it is. On The Changing Lights, Stacey, at different times, sings in English, Portugese, and French, and she sounds wonderful in all three languages. The arrangements and instrumental support on The Changing Lights from Tomlinson and the other UK-based musicians in the band are impeccably tasteful, varied, and interesting.<br /><br />Of Stacey's previous output, I particularly enjoyed Breakfast on the Morning Tram, a release on Blue Note in 2007. That album featured a mix of fresh, new originals and standards. For the originals, Tomlinson teamed up with novelist and lyricist Kashuo Ishiguro. That partnership shows up again on three originals on The Changing Lights: \\"The Summer We Crossed Europe in the Rain,\\" \\"Waiter, Oh Waiter,\\" and the title track, \\"The Changing Lights.\\" The rest of the repertoire features some great standards by well-known bossa nova composers such as Tom Jobim. The Changing Lights is, thus, a logical next step for Stacey Kent after Breakfast on the Morning Tram (yes, I'm aware that the French-language-only import Raconte-Moi immediately followed that album, not this one). The focus on music with a Brazilian flavor fits Kent very well (she has recorded nice renditions of several bossa nova tunes on previous albums).<br /><br />Stacey Kent fans won't want to miss this release, and those new to Stacey Kent could even start here, if they like Brazilian music. Highly recommended.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|i find the lyrics a fascinating & poetic truth.  i love no stops between songs.  the music is a mix of sound & the roots talents are unfairly unrecognized.  this eclectic combination is so fine.  i ordered it before release & i was right, i LOVE this cd.  kudos.
0300197187|5.0|I am not a great fan of history books and I have never completed one >200 pages. However, I finished this in 2 days. It is so superbly written, well organized and absolutely interesting with plentiful well selected pictures. Now is the first time of my 40+ life that I have basic knowledge how Central/Western Europe had evolved from the Roman Empire to WWI. In short, a great read. Highly recommended!<br /><br />p.s. Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.<br /><br />It is a bad idea to try to prevent people from knowing their own history. If you want to do anything new you must first make sure you know what people have tried before. Pg92<br /><br />After July comes August, Caesar Octavianus Augustus was Caesar's adoptive son. Having fought for a long time against a number of generals on land and at sea, he finally succeeded in becoming the sole ruler of the empire in 31BC, and so because the first to hold the tile of Roman Emperor. Since one month had been named after Julius Caesar, Augustus was given one too. He had certainly earned it . He may not have been extraordinary like Caesar, but he was a fair and prudent man who controlled himself at all times and so had earned the right to control others. It is said that he never gave an order or made a decision in anger. Whenever he felt his temper rising, he slowly recited the alphabet in his head, an dby the time had had reached the end he had calmed down. Pg102<br /><br />Soon every German prince - even those who owned on more than a miserable patch of land - had his own gigantic castle in the style of Versailles, with all the gold and damask, the clipped hedges, the men in great wigs, the powdered ladies in voluminous gowns, the courtiers and flatterers. They tried to imitate him in every way, but there was always something missing. They were what Louis XIV only played at being: somewhat comical puppet-kings, with pompous airs and glittering fancy dress. Louis XIV himself was more than that. And in case you don't believe me, I'm going to quote something from a letter he wrote to his grandson, when his grandson was leaving to become king of Spain: Never favor those who flatter you most, but hold rather to those who risk your displeasure for you own good. Never neglect business for pleasure, organize your life so that there is time in it for relaxation and entertainment. Give the business of government your full attention. Inform yourself as much as you can before taking any decision. Make every effort to know men of distinction, so that you may call on them when you need them. Be courteous to all, speak hurtfully to no man.\\" These really were the guiding principles of King Louis XIV of France, that remarkable mixuture of vanity, charm, extravagance, dignity, indifference, frivolity and sheer hard work. Pg234-5.

B0098QBEXO|5.0|There's a great story in this movie. It's incredibly depressing, yet light-hearted and funny. Benedict Cumberbatch plays this character so well, that it gets hard to watch when the character is suffering.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Yes, I would recommend the book, even though part of the story is hard to believe.  I wish the author provided a little more explanation.
B0089LOG02|5.0|My mother did not get on an orphan train but went from one foster home to another at the same time as this story due to parents that could not take care of the family. This struck more than a cord I'd memory and gave an incredible feeling for family, life routes and emotions. Very much enjoyed

B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|This album is the new music I've heard all year. And that's a big thing for me to say because I tend to be a bit more critical of female groups (although I'm not proud to say it). It's obvious that these gals have a connection with each other and that shows in what they've created musically. The songs are original, but with great nods toward some greats out there, maybe a mix of MJ, Chromeo, & Fleetwood Mac.  I can't stop listening.
0062073478|5.0|I loved every part of this story; I was very surprised at the ending.  Also, I think I need to read more of Agatha Christie's novels.

B0097PW7H8|2.0|I have a Galaxy S3 that never shows the same charging figures as the App. Often the app shows 100% charge but the phone shows between 85 and 90% which drops rapidly whn unplugged, even in standby mode. Eventually the 2 will agree somewhere around 70% charge. I tried a new (OEM) battery and have the same issues but the numbers are slightly different. The only useful purpose I see for the app is to determine which phone operations are consuming the most power and to stop or disable them.
B005SHTXN0|4.0|It's a great movie and it's fun to watch. Great storyline and actors. Dustin Hoffman did a great job acting.

0316322407|5.0|I've been a fan of Malala since her NYT documentary. This book is absolutely amazing and a true testament to the fight that she has in her, her love of education, and the desire for peace in Swat Valley. God has an amazing plan for this young girl. Try as they might, the Taliban will NEVER silence her sweet and powerful voice or stop her or any other girl from learning.<br /><br />In less than a day, I've already finished this book. This brave young girl has helped me to not take my education for granted. Education is a wonderful thing, and hopefully everyone in the world can have a chance to get an education.  I recommend this book to everyone and anyone it is truly a great read.<br /><br />Side note: I really do hope that she wins the Nobel. Also, If you want to get an insight into her fight for education and peace, and don't know much about her, before you read the book, watch her interview on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart and her UN speech. You'll be blown away.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|OMG!!! This story is so riveting it was hard not to watch the whole series in one sitting. Lots of drama, suspense with enough spice to keep you interested. Lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing.
B00CTT9646|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much that I've seen it 5 times in the theater and twice since I've had the blu-ray.<br /><br />I bought this set specifically for the phaser reproduction, since I have the phaser from the 2009 movie as well.  I had to have a matching set after all!<br /><br />Anyway, love the movie, love the phaser.

1401937519|4.0|Perceptive, passionate, and pushing the boundaries of many belief systems; this wonderful personal account of an NDE will inspire, and may be the catalyst to re-examine how we live. I found Ms. Moorjani's account riveting, candid, and profound. Her experience lines up with many quantum theories on the vastness of our true existence; which suggests we haven't even scratched the surface. The message of love and hope in this book is powerful. All who have faith that we are more than our corporeal vessels; and that we will continue to exist past our bodies' expiration dates, will be grateful for Ms. Moorjani's bravery in sharing this much-needed revelation.<br />My only nit-picky criticism was there was some redundancy; which I'm surprised wasn't edited out (this lost 1 star on that fact alone).  I do recommend this title as an inspirational, thought-provoking read. No one can say anecdotal evidence is either right, or wrong, since we simply do not possess the tools to measure it's accuracy, so for those who search for scientific evidence on matters of life after death, or the soul's true existence - either look elsewhere, or wait another 100 years for it to be proven. Until then, you'll have to take these personal NDEs on faith.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of those stories that you can't possibly figure out what is going on - or at least I couldn't.  Very well written.  I thought it was very clever.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Amazing read.  I bought this book because my husband wanted to read it.  I had no idea what I was starting.  I couldn't put the book down from the first chapter.  Regardless of your politics, you can not deny this man is a true hero!  God bless America, and God bless Texas!

B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a great game, except the connection is not always reliable. But you do receive credits when that happens so you are not out bingo points.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|At the end there was a hint that a sequel would come out and I can't wait. There are so few of this type of point and click adventure game where you collect needed items and solve puzzles without any pointless HO. LOVE IT!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This powerful drama explores the delicate relationship any human being has to all surrounding people and events. Specific actions trigger powerful memories, often with painful implications. The acting is phenomenal, and I highly recommend this series.

B009HEMW4W|5.0|Yes i would see it again and recomandate it to family and friends very good movie like it very much
B005QMOZOO|4.0|My daughter got me on to this book and I loved it.  It follows very closely along Austen's style of writing and I didn't want this book to end. I could visualise so much of the drama and characters in this but then again I am also a PD James' fan so it wasn't hard to be happy with this purchase.
1451695195|2.0|Had high hopes this would be a good book. The interviews of this author sounded good, Even bought it on CD's to give to my dad because he cannot see any longer. He too was disappointed.  Sorry I spent the money on a book and CD's.

B001NLKWLW|4.0|In her usual style, Kate Morton draws the reader into another world filled with multiple stories of connected people.  She has the ability to assist the reader in their effort to join these worlds and become part of the mysteries therein.  It's difficult to put them down and not keep guessing at the intricacies and relationships which she likes to cleverly alter to surprise and most often delight. Even if occasionally realism is exchanged for fantasy, one is never disappointed in the outcomes.
0345803485|5.0|Enjoyed that this series was written by an author from London England and placed in Seattle, Portland, etc. and she had never been here before this project.  I did enjoy the books and it was hard to put them down once you got started.

B00F35BV64|4.0|I was impressed with what questions this movie begins to ask the viewer in terms of what would you have done? It's not bad. It's a fun way to spend two hours.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|This show is wonderful. It is beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted. The only downside is Tamzin Merchant. I would highly reccomend.
B00151G08Y|5.0|I was drawn to Pendulum because of Immersion, and this one not only gives me plenty of that type of music, but also a delightful variety of pieces that show the range of the band. Unlike some, who listen to music much more critical, I either like what I hear or I don't. And I do like this one. After all, being art, it's all subjective and in the ear and mind of the beholder.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I couldn't set the book down. It is a very good book and I recommend it to everyone. Especially teens.
B00DIZS5GU|5.0|I do  not think there was or will be a better performance of the Requiem  I found perfect every aspect of it. The Orchestra, the chorus, the Conductor and all of the soloists were excellent.  I cannot describe the feeling I had when Jonas Kaufman starts the Kyrie Eleyson. I can listen to this Requiem again and again.  I should mention the quality of the filming.  The camera men did an excellent job.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Very moving account of a mother and child trapped in one room for 5 years.  I read this for a book group at nearly the same time the women and one child were rescued from a similar situation in Cleveland.
B005HSGB6W|5.0|The slang can make it seem hard to read.  But, if you just charge through, things become clear soon enough.  This is a classic about dystopian societies, and the characters are well developed.  You really start to empathize with the anti-hero.  Great read, a real page turner.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I bought this book, because I heard that if I liked [[ASIN:B00ASO8BI6 50 Ways to Eat Cock: Mouthwatering & Nutritious Rooster Recipes for the Imaginative Cook (Partially Paleo)]], then I would also enjoy this one, so I kind of expected to see some mouthwatering recipes here, too :D<br /><br />Well, there were none.<br /><br />But the story grabbed me, and I even found myself longing back to Paris, France, reliving again my visits to this wonderful city back when I lived in France.<br /><br />This is significant, because I've certainly NOT looked back, since I left France more than two years ago in 2011.<br /><br />The story is very honestly told, and I guess that you either like the author's direct style or not. I like honesty. And I've learned a lot about a world I had not idea about how was.<br /><br />Interesting indeed.
B005544TRQ|5.0|In love with this show. This would be on everyone's must watch list if a major network had picked this show up. With what is on TV today, this is a smart, quality show. There's strong women as well as men in this show...and it doesn't hurt that Harvey and Mike are easy to look at.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|The first of the movie series was excellent, here once more this excellent cast performs flawlessly in this exciting rendition of Star Trek.  The first movie won me over with each member of the cast so well chosen.  Action starts from the beginning and the plot and twists kept me glued to my seat.  I'll follow this series so long as it continues.  In 3D, using a 120 Hz Monitor and Shutter glasses, this movie is breath-taking.  Add it to your library and yes, it's all the better in 3d.
B004P1JDJO|3.0|Maybe it is just OK for me because it is not that surprising what motivates us. I think this is an interesting read to have in the back of your pocket when discussing strategy and business at the dinner table, but nothing new here.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love it, my wife loves it, and the ensemble acting and writing is really interesting, even if a lot more shark like than lawyers really are.
B001OKGV6W|3.0|It's good sci-fi. The woman portrayed in the movie by Jodie Foster gave up the search after 31 years of finding nothing. The universe is strangely silent without recognized contact with other intelligent species.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|I have tried using this, and finally just gave up. You can't start a search in a category (say, &#34;Men's Pants&#34;) and then begin looking for what you want. Just found it awkward to use
B00DL2W7Q4|5.0|Every line is thought-provoking, similar to the Tipping Point, Blink or the Outliers !<br /><br />This book needs to be read by everyone.<br /><br />His unique way of presenting the facts with innumerable statistics and unbelievable examples, is very impressive and highly enjoyable !  We cannot keep it down till we finish reading.  I naturally look forward to his next book !
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|In the era of REALLY CRAPPY mainline &#34;Hollywood&#34; movies and &#34;stars&#34;, it is great to know that a cable company is capable of such fantastic programming and casting such wonderful actors--Damien Lewis and Claire Danes. &#34;John Adams&#34; was great too. R. Manolakas
3406653642|5.0|It's a Super funny Book! Perfect for Every visitor, tourist and German (to notice how German they are)!<br />It is written in a Way that makes it enjoyable to read and laugh at the Same Time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a good game for bored people who are on the go or even relaxing to me I'll listen to something and play it it's competitive too if you sign into Facebook you can see what friends play and there high scores
B002ROKQKG|4.0|It's a nice book, well redacted and also shows an interesting point of view about the creation of the new democratic South Africa.<br /><br />This book is not only about a game and about a world champion, is more than that, this book is about how one extremely rare type of person achieved one of the modern miracles, a revolution without a civil war.<br /><br />The book also try to explain how is it possible that a sport could be so gratified and also so important in South Africa's history and also shows how it is possible to be such a great person as it is Nelson Mandela and how he conquers his enemies without the use of any violence and only with the use of friendship and respect.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to all kind of readers as an important part of universal knowledge and to remember how to manage your goals in a different way than to using any kind of violence
B008D28HYS|5.0|Largely the best nonogram game for Android (and I have tried many of them).  Good levels, and excellent playability (although it is still somewhat difficult to play the large grids).<br />Nice job!
B009PMEEY2|5.0|What a great game. Interesting context, a progressively challenging game but not impossible for those whose blinding speed days are a ways behind them. Lol It was engrossing and I was caught up in the story. Thanks folks. Well done.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|(Caution:  I'm not commenting on cuts or screen types in this review...I'm simply reviewing the show itself.)<br />I believe this is the first time the Muppets have taken a classic story and spun it into a film of their own.  Well, a job well done.  To this day, I still thoroughly enjoy this film.  Michael Kane comes to the screen as Ebenezer Scrooge and he brings with him everything we know and love/loathe about this classic character...but I mainly envy him for getting to star with the Muppets.  Since no adaption of \\"A Christmas Caroll\\" is complete without Charles Dickens's pros from the original book, Gonzo the Great steps into the writer's shoes to give us the background we need to be fully enthrawled in this story...it worked out perfectly, and having the wise-cracking Rizzo the Rat alongside him only made it better.  Every classic Muppet character had their part and carried it out with the precition and high quality we have come to expect of this fine franchise.  From Kermit the Frog as Bob Cratchet to Statler and Waldorf as Jacob and Robert Marley (note that Robert Marley wasn't in the book but was instead created for this film so Statler and Waldorf could portray these \\"brothers\\"...no complaints here), there was no flaw in the casting and performances.  The humor was classic of the Muppets as well as appropriate for this plot.  Fans of the classic story will be hard-pressed to find a better adaptation...I recommend it to any of them as well as any fans of the Muppets.  Enjoy...and whatever version you get, it can still be a great film...that part is ultimately up to you.
B00F9A903O|5.0|started playing this game and unlike the other Gameloft games--this does not require additional memory after you install this--which is why i am giving this 5 stars--i also would recommend the Ice Age game too.
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|It just as great as the first movie! There are no mistakes in the movie, it was done correctly and overall I laughed a lot! Definitely for a collection! Screw low raters. You have no life if you can't enjoy a good (great in this case) comedy.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It use to work perfertly fine a few months ago now i cant log in at all &middot; Hopefuuly u guys update it cause i really need this appp
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|Trailer gave you the idea it was him and his kid running around earth.  It's way more than that.  I would say overall 4 stars for depth and creativity and cinematography, but the acting could have been better.  But, what can you demand off a kid?  Overall 4 stars pleasantly surprised worth watching once.
B00005A3KS|5.0|This movie is a Classic and Totally entertaining. I have watched it repeatedly and I'm not EVEN done.One of Patrick Swayzes best. R.I.P.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like this game a lot. Especially like that you can get acorns (the premium currency) without having to spend real money. Some games the only way to get premium currency is to buy it. It takes awhile to get enough but it can be done.
B00DZAWPNM|5.0|This album is fantastic! It uses a lot of electronic elements as opposed to previous albums. That's the great thing about Panic!, that they are always willing to change their music up and do a great job when they do. No two albums sound the same. However, if you are looking for more of the same, this album might not be for you.
0399230033|5.0|I buy this for all the new parents I know as it makes a great gift.  It's a simple, wonderful bedtime book.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Easy and simply to understand!<br />If you are following the exercices you have to do, in 21 days you can be a different person.
B001DF68MA|5.0|Excellent do not disturb the leg and my boy can go in from and i can see always, is confortable
140006922X|3.0|[...]<< Full Review.    Snippet:    This is a book which is perhaps more about the author, Reza Aslan, than it is about Jesus of Nazareth.    It is also a work of great insight and, in contrast, amateur mistakes.    Aslan was from a Muslim immigrant family to the USA and became a Christian in an evangelical youth-conversion experience.    He learned the \\"naive\\" version of Jesus in this community, but then went to school and became skeptical about much of it.    The problem with writing about Jesus, as Albert Schweitzer so clearly said, is that we tend to see in Jesus a mirror image of our ideal selves rather than a true look at Jesus himself.    The plain old mistakes in the book:    1) Aslan continues to paint a picture of Jesus as a peasant. This comes more from Roman Catholic romanticism than from any historical evidence. Simply not true. Mary was connected with the high priestly branch of the Levite tribe and Joseph, Jesus' step-father, was of the royal Davidic line in Judah. He spoke as \\"one who had authority,\\" thus one used to giving orders and not taking them. There is a good chance he earned a fortune as a stone contractor (Greek: tekton, which is \\"builder\\" not \\"laborer\\") in Sepphoris, right across the ravine from Nazareth. His main metaphoric descriptive image is stone, not wood. All of his parables, economically speaking, are told from the position of management, not labor. A couple of them could be titled \\"It's hard to get good help.\\" When he was crucified, his robe was so valuable that soldiers gambled for it.    2) Aslan talks about \\"sea air\\" coming off the Sea of Galilee. Page 95: \\"....the entire village stretched along a wide expanse of the seacoast, allowing the cool salt air to nurture all manner of plants and trees.\\" Dude, the Sea of Galilee is a freshwater lake.    3) Aslan claims that Paul changed his name at his conversion (i.e. from Saul to Paul, p. 184). Sha-ool of Tarsus (Saul) remained Sha-ool in the synagogue for the rest of his life. But he worked with Gentiles and his native tongue was Greek, not Semitic Aramaic/Hebrew. Thus \\"Paulos\\" literally was his Greek nick-name, likely used since he was a child. And Paulos means....\\"Shorty.\\" Need some tents? Here's my card. Call me Shorty. It's absurd to think that his conversion changed him from Sha-ool to Shorty. Many Jews do the same today. My friend Reuben ben-Yonatan also has a passport that reads \\"Robert Palmer.\\"    4) His knowledge of Greek is spotty. He calls the apostles \\"apostolou\\" instead of \\"apostoloi.\\" This is the kind of thing you see with TV preachers all the time.    Aside from this, there is one insight worth the price of the book. Aslan delivers an excellent interpretation of Jesus using his phrase \\"render unto Caesar\\" vis-a-vis taxation. I did an entire post on this which you can read HERE: [...]    And along the way, there is some good substance about the \\"zealot\\" nature of Jesus which is uncomfortable, but helpful.    It's worth a read, as with virtually any serious book about Jesus.    Jesus has a tendency to show us a lot about ourselves, and who can't benefit from that?
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you grew up in the 80's and played an Atari 2600, or waisted time with friends playing D&D, or any one of the other hundreds of geeky things during that decade you have to read this book!  It is a love letter to that time and the people who ventured through that period.  It brings back all those special memories and leaves one feeling nostalgic for those times while still set in the near future.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|TNG is a must see series for any scifi or action series fan. Great acting along with great stories and character development made season five of the series excellent and enjoyable.
0140564349|5.0|This is our favorite of Robert McCloskey's books.  It is written in such a way as to include and involve every one reading it.  We love the book and the ducklings!
B00E89VXQY|5.0|I always love Metallica's albums with live versions of their songs, and  this album is no exception.  Great stuff, especially with the live explosions during some of the songs.  My 6-year old grandson likes to listen to this album with me.  Great bonding time!!
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Today at night I will begin to first film and my children see it with me.<br />Very good presentation. I exepect that my chlidren don´t be afraid.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|GOOD BOOK  FINDING OUT THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE IS REALLY FUNNY.  IN HERE HOPE HAS A LOT OF DEMONS TO OVERCOME BUT THEN SO DOES HER BOYFRIEND AND FINDS OUT THINGS NEITHER ONE KNEW ABOUT THERE CHILDHOOD
B009GEDP26|5.0|A funny, mystery, and easy show to watch. Would recommend to anyone looking for a new show to watch seasons of.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was one of the most erotic, romantic books I have read to date. The longing they have for each other can be felt in the words. I LOVE THIS BOOK!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Amazing...  Probably one of the best books I've ever read. So beautifully written. I was reluctant to finish it, as I just did not want to part with the characters.  Have recommended it to everyone!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|As always, this is a chase around the world to discover clues from the past to help divert an immanent threat of a highly technical/scientific nature.  A quick read and exciting throughout!!
B006PIXKVW|5.0|Nice, feel good movie to watch with granddaughter, or just by yourself when you want a lift-me-up.  Old-fashioned movie without cursing.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I purchased this book on my Kindle after a recommendation by my 55-year-old, very down to earth father. He loves the series and has actually read all of the books!  If he enjoyed the book and it hooked him, it would hook anybody! As a 7th grade teacher, I would also recommend this for young adults. It was appropriate and tastefully written, even for preteens and teens.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Rio is a wonderful movie. My son and I never get tired of watching it.  I would definitely recommend this movie.  It is uplifting colorful and full of wonderful characters.
B005QYKD4I|3.0|I miss Megan Fox. The new girl sucks. She has less acting ability and is not as hot as Megan Fox.
B00CP4RZCU|4.0|I wish it had stated that it was a live CD. I really didn't care for the 1st disc. I wanna hear some rockin' music by Zakk and this failed to do it for me but I don't know what the 2nd CD is like so I'll get back to it later.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Intriguing book that holds your interest and takes some interesting turns. Worth the read. Hard to put down so you'll find yourself reading into the middle of the night.
B005544TRQ|5.0|One of the best shoes out there right now!  It is a must see...love the characters and story lines.  Poor Lewis!
B00821PCJS|1.0|Neither good action or good dialog - it just falls outside of the good categories for wanting to watch more than one episode
B00CE0ZY46|5.0|Timeless, priceless entertainment for ALL family members.  Mommy doesn't say no to Shaun the Sheep.  Mommy loves watching Shaun the Sheep more than the kids do!
B0089K7DGW|1.0|I was very disappointed in this Blu-ray set.  The discs would not display the individual chapters; instead, every time I chose 'Chapters' from the menu, the disc displayed a color-bar type of display and completely froze up.  I had to watch the series by choosing 'Play all' and then advance the chapters.  Doesn't sound like a big deal, but you should be able to choose chapter by chapter of these discs. I want the second season, but I will not order the Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy version for fear that they're all defective.
B000IZA9PI|5.0|really really nice, i love this kind of movies and star trek is the best one of the gender. great
B00C32R64G|5.0|I'm very happy that Dominus changed their style and became Volbeat. There are some great songs on this album and I've thoroughly enjoyed listening to it. Very melodic, great guitar riffs and great clean vocals. Doc Holliday and Our Loved Ones being my favorites.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|Loved the movie, but the book is even better.  This is the 2nd time I've read it.  Fannie is a fabulous gifted writer.  I've read everything she's written.  This is a must read, in my opinion.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|This was a fantastic conclusion to the trilogy, in my opinion. I love how the Crakers got a bit corrupted by Toby and developed in ways Crake tried his best to eliminate as possibilities. I also really enjoyed Zeb's back story. And I am happy that Toby had a little happiness after everything she went through before the Waterless Flood. I could write much more, but don't want to include any spoilers.
B009QW85ZU|5.0|Great movie!<br />I recommend it! Sean Connery like always outstanding performance. A lot of action on different scenarios around the world.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|I WATCHED THIS MOVIE 5 TIMES BEFORE I BOUGHT IT.  SHAH RUKH KHAN IS A MAGNIFICENT AND SUPERB ACTOR.<br />THIS IS ONE MOVIE THAT YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO GET UP TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.  THIS MOVIE HAS EVERYTHING, HAPPINESS, SADNESS, FEAR AND MORE.  WATCH IT,  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.
B0009DBXXG|5.0|This is a replacement for my original which I wore out! That should tell you how much I enjoy this.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|I can choose how many pieces I would like to solve.  It gives me the most quiet time to enjoy my free time.<br /><br />My children take turns to see who can solve a puzzle faster.  So it's great for everyone.
0061950726|5.0|My book club really enjoyed reading and discussing The Orphan Train. Had interesting fiction along with a little US. history.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just could not put it down! I usually do not write a review but I loved this book! Highly recommend this book!
B002NWXRYY|4.0|housesitter is a funny movie, it will keep you watching and laughing thru the whole movie. its worth buying, goldy hawn is funny.
B008PZZV8S|4.0|I can not believe I never saw this movie before.  Pretty good flick, great cast, makes it a very intense watch.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|We choose it because me and my wife are big fans of Harry potter. We would recommend this to any fellow fans. It's worth it and it's selling at a good price.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a very fun game I often enjoy playing it when I am bored it passes time and I like the updates
B0028MBKVG|3.0|Great book it had a great story line to it. I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read
0061900656|4.0|This book is adorable and should be purchased immediately by anyone that is a part of this joyous event! My son recently turned 2 and he is going to be big brother soon.  In a effort to make the transition a little easier, I bought this book.  Many people complain that it's wordy.  It is wordier than other books for the toddler/preschooler age group but that doesn't make it a bad thing.  You can have plenty of opportunities to read to your child and each time  he/she can learn to sit for longer periods of time. My son likes it a lot and is happy when I pull it out of the book shelf.  Sometimes he'll grab it on his own and \\"read\\" it and look at the pictures, which is still a good thing.  He seems to undertand it.  I do agree with a few parents that it does not at all mention the possibility that Mommy may be nursing the new baby. I am fine with it the way it is myself but I am sure there are other books out there that probably emphasis nursing it which is great.  Well worth the $6 I paid.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|My son love this movie. He watch it all the time. Action and scify.  He like the book series as well
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I highly recommend watching Suits.  It will immediately make you want to be a corporate lawyer.  Or just buy nice suits.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is personally, now one of my favorite book's. It's just full of action and it's a really good laugh. Five star book right here.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Love it! I wanted to know weather now and in the next few days. I got! HAPPY! Also like the icon!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game i love the updates and new charecters and outfits i wish i could hit the jackpot in the mystery box i defiantly recommend this game for kids my age
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Yes we all miss layne and he can never replaced! Or can he? This CD is really good and thought out, my favorite cd since Dirt! Give William a chance it's not his falt Layne gave up on life,was a junky and died a 85 pound toothless mess alone in his condo, That was his choice ! and why should AIC just give up and quit because one of its members (not even a musician) quit life? They waited a respectable amount of time and made two great CDs with a new singer! This cd rocks and so does black gives way to blue
0689835604|5.0|I bought this for my niece and its her new fav book (15 months old)! It is teaching her while being fun!
B009PMEEY2|5.0|My only problem is that on my PMID 720 it keeps locking up and requiring restart. The game does keep your last level even when it locks up.<br /><br />Asdide from that problem, and I can't be sure whether the lockups are because of a conflict with my tablet orif it is caused by a problem in the programming of the game.<br /><br />Try it, you'll like it.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Loved the premise and story line.  Effects are pretty cool too!  Morgan Freeman is always awesome.  Cruise has a solid performance.
B00FN811SY|5.0|it is easy to use and simple. it takes real effort to produce an App that makes Gods word user friendly. I recommend for every person that can read and write
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Live in a dorm with 16 girls and we have become attached to this movie.  Definitely a &#34;feel good&#34; film.
B0058PJ6NE|5.0|great app , download the samethings for free that can be purchased and stop working and you tube dosn,t stop and rip you off.stop buying apps that route you to youtube.
B00CFOY244|4.0|Excellent movie. Great entertainment. Both actresses did a marvelous job. The screen play made the show. Completely unexpected turns  I was not able to see the very surprising end in advance. I liked this one well enough that I bought the DVD for a friend.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|only the rope and morning to the rope<br />Car and morning of morning to a sad day for me and morning I have a good idea that we are not be a great deal with it and morning
B0061TQBRK|5.0|I've always given Lacuna Coil a shot, ever since I first heard them in early 2000's. It never connected with me. They tried hard, but I felt like there was just nothing remarkable about them. The lyrics bored me. I really can't say what it is about this album, maybe its that the singing (ale and female) and the music all gel perfectly for once. It feels like a band working together instead of separate people stepping into the spotlight. However, I like nearly every song on here. Tee losing My religion cover is somehow very good. Che Cazzo!
B008C20TDG|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who is a slave to diets!!! This book has certainly helped me understand what it truly is to eat healthy and adapt a plan for life - a life style change not just another diet to add to my list. Very easy to read and understand - luved it.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I love this DVD, it sure brings back memories from my youth, The Eagles are one of the most prolific and longest running bands throughout history, the folks of Melbourne were great to see enjoying these multi talented men perform live.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So this is a 5 star no doubt about it. Reality crashes in and the book takes you to an unexpected love story. You feel their pain and feel their love grow. Just as i have, i hope you eill choose to read this book.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|One of my favorite bands from back in the day, it was great seeing the early history of the Eagles, their many personal trials and decisions along the way, still one of the most prolific, longest running bands in history.
0470901071|5.0|This is a great product, and  it really helps in studying for the CCNA exam. 100% recommended.<br /><br />It really prepares you for the CCNA.
0425263924|4.0|Entwined with You by Sylvia Day<br />I'd felt the the pull that came from finding the other half of myself. I needed him like I needed my heart to beat. Ms Day can write !!! I was in love with just those two lines, but I was a little disappointed with Eva, damn the man killed for her, she is too needy and annoying with that being said I loved the new twists and turns about Cary and Eva's parents. And what is up with Gideon's mom have she lose her mind or what? And who killed the hit man?<br /> Book  three is better than I expected it be, but I was still disappointed that the ended left me feeling like I missed something....but I liked the book anyway :)<br />I was high on 4.9 stars<br />jackee322001.tumblr.com<br />[...]
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed...it was way funny...had me laughing out loud a lot. Why do I need to type nine more words?
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some levels are way too hard but its fun sometimes. Like 5 of the begginning levels I can't beat. But I guess it is fine.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Love this show! Great actors and great plots. Julianna is awesome, I would watch any show she is acting in.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Lettie, the 2nd main character.  Is she real or s figment of imagination? You be the judge. Phenomenal writing, captivating story, youthful nightmares ensued me. I can't recommend this book more strongly!<br />READ IT!!!
B0039A8QVI|4.0|I like this album quite a bit.  It is rare to find an album full of good songs and this one does that, in my opinion.  I don't have to press skip at all.  Well worth the money on this one.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really liked this story and am looking forward to the sequel.  I found the book very different from anything I have read before.  I especially enjoyed the pictures, they look like something my grandmother had in her trunk of old pictures of past relatives.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I purchased this mainly because the writer is from around Huntsville, TX which is where my son went to college (SHSU).  I found it pretty sweet that a Texas boy was in print and had served his country and want to contribute to that.  Purchased copies from friends as well.  A good easy ready if you enjoy hearing about people that are cut from a better cloth than I.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love being able to access the kindle books from my tablet. It makes reading more enjoyable, and portable for me! Kindle has really good selections of any genre book.
B002C949KE|5.0|I have never thought that predict people would be this easy and why my predictions were wrong almost 100% before I have read this book.<br /><br />It is really an easy to follow guidebook packed full of practical advice on how to break out our mindless routines we follow when people take advantage of our default brain wiring.<br /><br />It really deepened my perspective!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The best book I have read in 2013 from the greatest story teller in the last 10 years. I want more!!!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I really enjoyed this app and I'm thrilled that I was able to download the app when it was the free app of the day. Now that I know that I like this publisher and their style of games, I'll buy more of their apps in the future.
B00915G6WQ|3.0|By the 7th season we've gotten pretty used to Dexter and his schtick.  The characters are new but this is more about a psychopath who develops a sense of love which is basically the polar opposite of this personality trait.  Granted, loving the actor who is Dexter's counterpart is easy if you are heterosexual, the storyline grows a bit thin.  There are some good moments as we see the end is beginning for the 8th and final season.  If you bought 1-6, surely you need to add this.  If you are a newbie, season 7 would be the LAST place to begin.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Not much to add. I bought this album trying out something \\"smart\\"- I was sorting albums on Amazon by average customer rating and just picking out some of the top selections.<br /><br />This is the kind of move that sounds better in my head than in reality, usually, but man, did I win here. My favorite album in a long time.<br /><br />Howard Hawks defined a great movie as \\"Three great scenes, no bad ones\\" and I've always applied that thinking to albums as well. By that measure, this album is one of the best that I own.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Leonardo DeCaprio, and Toby McQuire, make this movie great.  The story is told, much better, than the previous one made, with Robert Redford.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really easy for the children to play. It makes them feel like they are doing something important.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This movie had the most fantastic special effects.  The new crew, especially Spock, is fantastic.  All Star Trek fans must see this.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is the third copy of Aenima for me since it gets played so much. It also does quite a bit of traveling. I love this band.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|I saw this years ago when I rented it. Everyone is so young and as usual Kevin Spacy does an amazing job.
0743270754|5.0|This is a great book. I am still only halfway through but it is really interesting so far. Good buy.
B00EQ30RVY|4.0|I've been a fan of STP since 1996, been a fan of Army of Anyone and Talk Show, not so much of Velvet Revolver. This EP to me is a...side project. Hence, it says Stone Temple Pilots with Chester Bennington, he is not a permanent member, he is just a session member so to speak.<br /><br />The Ep in itself is good until the last song which I didn't like. He sang well, he was a good mix between him and the other members. The Ep is a showcase of how they can carry on without Weiland still...it is not STP.
B008OOYALE|5.0|great game love dragons  gets rid of stress little costly takes a little to long to save up for habitats and clearing..
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Yow!  Zombies, a special effects team, drama, and still, this movie will not gel. A classic example of how money, big names, slick production values, and too many cooks can still F*** up a simple recipe.<br />  This movie made a better theater trailer than a full screen epic disaster film.<br />So, don't invest your time unless you plan to take a shower at the end of this one to get da stink off.
0812550757|5.0|-=[No Spoilers]=-<br /><br />But what about the Hive Queen? That was the last question you asked yourself before you came here.<br /><br />If you're reading this, then you've already reached a conclusion on whether you will read Speaker For The Dead. Ask yourself, why are you reading reviews to a book when you've already made up your mind? Do you always question yourself when the answer is obvious?<br /><br />It's because Ender's Game was great and now you're thinking about reading it's successor. However you've learned that the books [Enders Game vs Speaker For The Dead] are very different.<br /><br />The short answer to your question is, yes they are.<br /><br />Ender's Game - Every reader can relate to one character in the story as it revolves around children. Everybody has been one and remembers the conflicts we dealt with at that age. Typically you bond with Ender, Bean, or Valentine.<br /><br />Speaker For The Dead - Ender is now an adult at 35 years.  He is now wiser and dealing with suitable issues. Adult issues.. such as Politics, Religion, and War.<br /><br />*This book has a lot of unique names and a few words that are in Portuguese, but it won't effect the story if you pronounce it incorrectly or simply rename them.<br />Pipo = Pee-poh<br />Libo = Lee-boh<br />Quim = KEEM (but in America translation, that would be KIM)<br /><br />**The first 100 pages are a little slow, but then it picks up quick just like its predecessor.
B00004STDN|1.0|Just some bad acting by almost every actor in this movie, especially Janine Turner, and I really like her. Not even The Italian Stallion can be tough enough to do what he was suppose to have done in this movie.<br /><br />Terrible!! They had to throw in the \\"f\\" word over and over and over to fill dialogue I guess. That does not take much talent to write or say with meaning and of course that makes the bad guys appear even meaner.<br /><br />Almost turned this movie off, but stuck with it.  Waste of time and sleep!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The only reason I gave this 4 stars is that it was a little slow to pick up my interest in the beginning.  Otherwise I would strongly recommend this book.
B00F5F0208|4.0|This album was ok but for the most part the songs flow don't really lead up to each other like they did in take care
B002HL3PN4|5.0|this is a great movie that really embodies the book and all its magic!! i recommend all Harry Potter movies!
B000RIWAVW|5.0|I THINK PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE IN THE WORLD AS SEEN THIS FILM AT LEAST ONCE IN THEIR LIFE, THERE IS REALLY NOT MUCH TO SAY, THIS FILM IS A ALL TIME CLASSIC AND THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME OF YEAR TO WATCH IT WITH THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE :0)
1451626096|5.0|Love all Philippa Gregory novels!  History, intrigue, romance, are the hallmarks of her novels.  How can you ever go wrong with that?
B004HYDL1K|5.0|a very action packed movie i cant wait for machete 2 to come out amazon got it to me in one day
B007TK77QE|5.0|I was eager to go on reading and although there were lots of characters in the story, at the end the author managed to find a credible solution to each one of them.  I just found it funny to see so many parenthesis throughout the book.
B008Y212PI|5.0|It's not too difficult, and you get a cute reward after each puzzle completed. I liked the 5x5 puzzles the best. Good FAOTD.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|My grandson thinks this is the best Angry Birds game ever!!  I have played it, too, and find it challenging--not unusual for me--but it is fun, and my grandson gets a lot of laughs watching me and trying to teach me how to play!
B002QCAXOS|1.0|This sounded like an intriguing mystery but everything about it was, IMHO bad B movie stuff.  Lots of ridiculous, not offensive nudity.<br />Truly a waste of whatever I spent.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Its been a while that I have just sat down and listened to a whole album straight but man... I love this album!
0763657875|4.0|I purchased this book for my 5-year-old grandson as a companion to the Big Ben nanoblock set also from Amazon.  The book is well made, with great pop-ups that are double-sided.  The information is interesting.  My only objection is that not all information is factual.  The book illustrates and describes several legends of ghosts, including one in which the beheaded victim carries around the missing head.  Gruesome!  It was difficult to persuade my grandson that the ghost stories weren't true since all other information was obviously based on facts, which is why I chose 4 stars instead of 5.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy this game alot.  I have mastered only one suite but it keeps me happy.<br />However does anyone else find that the game plays itself and argues with you re placement of cards.<br />I kid you not.  The other night,cards were moving so fast and so many, that we ended up missing the black 9<br />and could not close out the game.  It was funny but also annoying.  Anyone know why this happens?<br />Thank goodness I have a sense of humor.  I love Solitair games and really still love this one despite it's pushiness.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Not a  guys book, like Peyton Place of old. The last chapter did make it readable. No real surprises at all.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This was a brilliant twist on the overly done zombie genre.  This is a good watch could of been longer ..
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST.  GREAT GRAPHICS, NEAT STORY.  TRY IT, YOU WILL LOVE IT.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed.  (And I loved the monkey.)
B003PBB4ME|2.0|I picked this up in a hurry so I could easily shoot somewhat steady footage at night with LED's mounted above.  The project has zero budget and this was priced just right for a guilt free purchase.  Though it does add a nice bit of stability to the shots (Canon 60D / Tokina 11-16mm), the arm flexes and bounces considerably under the weight of my camera.  It was cheap and so it feels cheap, but I can see getting a few uses out of this before I retire it for something robust.  Plus, it oddly smells like BBQ sauce right out of the box.
B000OVLINI|5.0|The characters come alive and enter your soul.  The language is beautiful and it is as if you are walking the streets of Barcelona along with Daniel et al.
0060723513|5.0|This book filled my head with adventure and spiritual medicine.  It was written in first-person so as the reader you are drawn in very close to this amazing world few will ever see.  I'd recommend this to everyone.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Incredibly addictive. Gillian Flynn once again created a mystery that kept me on the edge of my seat and guessing til the very end.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Kerman's account of her time in prison is thought provoking and very insightful.  Easy reading and very enjoyable to read about her friendships and what occurred while she was behind bars..
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Good show to watch with a family on a large tv. Very colorful and fast moving. will buy the movie. Hope it is on the black friday list..
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|The acting is great, and although the story is good, it just seems to lack imagination. It keeps you interested all through until the end where it stops suddenly with little thought.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Convenient and handy to have easy to read Don't know what else to except it is a must have on your Kindle
B003IDMUJA|4.0|I have grown up and lived in Malawi for over 20 years and this book is extremely accurate.<br /><br />The village lifestyle is depicted to actual reality, if one could have the smells emitted by a book, it would capture the true essence of day to day living in a village in Malawi.<br /><br />Although at the end of the book it was mainly focused on the technical aspect of the windmill, the overall book was detailed and gave the reader a first hand experience of what it is like living in an African village, with all the sad and funny aspects of life.
B005ZMTAXQ|5.0|Our grandchildren love this movie and it is a good one for our library.  lt is a fun movie for adults too.
140006922X|5.0|Two recent events in my life encouraged me to read Aslan's book on the historical Jesus: a Founding Father trip to  Monticello where the Thomas Jefferson story has been made into a veritable high religion by the keepers of his economically profitable flame and reading Henry Wiencek's recent book, \\"Master of the Mountain\\" which attempts to demystify T.J., the man from the myth, arousing a  spate of controversy. I like to read opposing views on a topic having been trained to think critically and also having  recently witnessed the disgraceful Fox interview of Aslan by a non-critical thinker clothed in Christian blinders questioning his authority as a  Muslim to do the unthinkable--write a book on Jesus and Early Christianity. Just who in the Hell  does he think he is??? Perhaps the Foxy lady needed less perfect cosmetic make-up and more intellectually \\"messy\\" questioning, thinker credentials than the standard Fox talking points about a subject she obviously knew only her from her Church Bible classes.<br /><br />Like the Fox interviewer, I am no religion scholar but having passed through 13 years of Catholic schooling and prodigious colorful myths, I had serious questions about the Incarnation, Trinity, the Virgin birth, the Resurrection, and the whole divinity of Jesus idea while appreciating Jesus' ethics and morals and peace loving message and ability to influence generations of followers.. As a related sideline from my Monticello trip reading, I found that many of our Founding Fathers--Jefferson included---although often baptized as Episcopalians, were secretly Deists steeped in the Enlightenment philosophy of common sense and reason. So I was in good company. Like them, I  was ready and anxious to read a more factual treatment of the subject than the Nicene Creed spouted blindly and unquestioningly every Sunday in Catholic Churches everywhere on the planet..I found Aslan's reader friendly book and contextual historical placement of Jesus in a time of repressive Roman occupation and corrosive High Priest and Jewish elitist Roman syncophancy which fueled radical Jewish nationalistic thought, movements, and Jesus like freedom fighters----very enlightening, heartening, and satisfying. Having lived my college years through the tumultuous 60's, I found  this revolutionary, zealous, de-deified Jesus much more a guy with whom I could relate and sit down and share a loaf and a fish sandwich with at some  Hippy poetry spouting cafe.. I had always wondered how a movement started by a radical Jew ended up being led by an infallible, Roman Catholic, jewel bedecked Pope spouting the Latin liturgy of my childhood.. Aslan cleared all of that up for me with plenty of scholarly documentation and pages of notes I  found as interesting as the preceding main chapters. When he was speculating about what might have been, he lets you know that and does give credit to those scholars and their preceding works he has leant heavily on like Dominic Crossan etc...<br /><br />Warning: if you thought the Fox/Aslan interview very fair and if you seriously enjoy your Bible as Literal Fact Thumping undeterred by history, and fighting the annual  Bill O'Reilly Christmas Wars, and loud, Nicene Creed parroting, and ritual parodying of the Greatest Story Ever Manufactured---for Heaven's sakes-- DO NOT READ THIS BOOK.<br />It could lead to some serious, transformative, disruptive----\\"god forbid\\"----critical thinking.<br /><br />And although Aslan never hints at or mentions it--his book encouraged me to do some  serious questioning of the whole Jewish/Palestinian/Islamic  religious/occupational/territorial quagmire that affects all of us globally. Imagine that!! Boo!
B00846REIS|5.0|Love love love this book series!!!!  I just keep reading it over and over again, drawn to the depth of love Eva and Gideon have for one another!
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|This was a really good movie.  Anyone who enjoys supernatural and horror movies will enjoy this. I would recommend this movie to anyone except children.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is the best substitute to Roku and other smart tvs. IF you do not have a smart TV then all you need is Chromecast. They have Netflix and you tube support and it works seamlessly with both services. I can cast from my laptop, iphone and ipad. If it had and just a few more apps and DLNA/uPnP support I would have given it 5 stars and that is all it takes to match Roku.
B004XZR63M|4.0|Every student in business school should read this book. It was introduced to me by my grandson who is studying at university.  Like he said, &#34;it's hard to stop reading this book&#34;.  The secrets to becoming rich are well covered for those who are capable of sticking to and achieving these goals.  However, not everyone's vision of life is to be rich. Life is much more complex than that. Nevertheless, I would recommend it as a worthy read.
0425263991|5.0|I have never read any of the books in the Psy-Changling series and I now will never read another, because the perfection in this book, I will never risk. Singh is  a brilliant storyteller. I will re-read this one, and love it each time!
B0093I77L0|2.0|The movie was done by master plagiarist Zach something, who seems to be known for being paid to bloody up icons.<br />Watchmen is really no different from dawn of the dead and I assume man of steel in its irreverence towards the \\"magic\\" of the original source material. Preferring instead to gut these \\"properties\\" of their spiritual side while kicking over a bucket of gore to fill the void.<br /><br />Watchmen's black freighter story was great as a comic in a comic but here Zack turns it into a bloated overstated rambling mess of an animation within a plagiarism of a comic book. So you see whats wrong right there.<br /><br />There are too few cool synchronistic moments from the comic, and too many gory mean add ons, as if the original story wasn't mean gritty and violent enough.<br /><br />This ultimate cut does come with the hc book, so for $20 or less it's a good deal just for that.<br />But personally I would go with the absolute watchmen book for around $50.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It's not easy.. but holy crap it's fun. Downloaded it for my kindle fire HD and my wife keeps stealing it to play this game. Worth way more than the .99 I paid. I would highly recommend.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Really enjoyed this one. I'm not all that crazy about Mickey Haller. I do like it when Connelly combines Haller and Bosch as he did in this one. The Reversal was a gripping novel right to the end. I could not put this one down. Connelly near his best.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|It's hard to believe that there is so much quality Dylan material gathering dust.<br />This is an excellent release, probably better than the original. Dylan fans should love it.<br />My favorite - Pretty Saro.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Series had plenty of twists and plot turns. Was thoughtfully written and well acted. The ending was a complete surprise. Bought the same thing from iTunes and it would not play (sound did not sync with picture, picture kept stalling and very pixelated - horrible quality) and was more expensive. Make sure you buy from Amazon!
B000002GKT|4.0|I was very pleased when this album was first released<br />many years ago.  i had seen humble pie open for derek and<br />the dominos 6 months before,october 1970 at the fillmore east.<br />quite a double bill for a ticket price of $5.50<br />the studio cd's cant capture the vocal power of steve. he let<br />it all out that night and impressed bill graham enough to sign<br />them for thier next trip to new york when this cd was recoreded.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Fun movie great story line. Can't wait for pt 2. Minuns are great lil guys.need some on my team. Must see movie.
B000000WCA|5.0|all the songs are great 90's pop, very catchy, anybody that lived through their success can remember how good it was, this is just full of my childhood memories.
B0017I1IZA|4.0|This one is vert funny. After you've read the first seven you'll want to read this one. It was very enjoyable.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|Disappointing. This movie has nothing to do with partying. If I wanted to watch a romantic comedy, I would have ordered one.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Close enough to the real Reacher in the books. Tom Cruise pulls it off better than I thought he would
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Good replacement for my android keyboard much easier to use I like the predictive words and how it learns my texting
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Well written, easy to believe characters. Hard to stop reading once I got started. Beware - very sexually explicit. Looking forward to the next books in this series.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I'm really loving the app right now. You can text people from all around the world for FREE! But the app should really be able to update on the kindle fire.
B00EQF0JJC|2.0|Interesting conceit but ultimately fails as the distraction of watching the play unfold in a modern setting repeatedly disconnects with the Shakespearean dialog.  Shakespeare's comedies fare best when presented simply and abstractly;  the subtlety afforded by modern film making techniques leads one to expect more, but ultimately makes much ado about nothing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fantastic. Great series. Great story line. Once you start watching you will be hooked. Can't wait for season 4. Good job!!
B009ZQJ0ME|1.0|I did not even watch the entire movie.  so it is hard to say much about it.  Maybe I'll try it again sometime
B00594XOZU|1.0|So the app has worked great for me about 3 months now but all the sudden it won't let me login. It says &quot;taking to long to log in&quot; and I have seen the same thing has been happening to others. If there's an update that fixes this it would be 4 stars for me. Fix soon please
B006BQM762|3.0|It was ok.  It struggled to keep my attention at times.  So I really can't think of much more to say
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game, would give 5 stars but the constant posting to Facebook is annoying. Not everyone wants to do this to earn credits. Please fix this.
B001JU4S44|4.0|Action well done. Normally I get bored on action movies for their lack of interesting content but the MI movies can capture my attention.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|So many characters and so many stories could easily make a novel confusing; however, Hosseini has a gift of giving the reader a deep connection with each of his characters and their journeys.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie one of my very favorites.  Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor.  I could watch forest any day.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Love it, grew up with this movie. It's a Classic and everyone should watch and enjoy it :o) for all ages.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great! Script, acting, setting all superb, Cannot wait until Season 4.  We Will be sad when it is all finished.
B00F4PM6WG|4.0|My 21-month old grandson is delighted with this little app.  The only complaint is that dragging the rail-cars from the top of the screen down into the track is tricky.  The attention to detail with sounds and popping clouds etc. is delightful.
B00AEFYGJW|4.0|Angelina Jolie is the ultimate female badass. Throw in some Daniel Craig eye candy action to match hers, and you've got two gorgeous people that make you want to join in the adventure and be a third wheel.  I hope to see Angelina and Daniel Craig matched up again in future movies because these two take action to a whole nother level.
B00FEN1C50|2.0|Okay movie but it was not very interesting. Needed mire of something in the movie, dint really like the beginning.
B00006RAKP|4.0|...what more needs to be said?  If you love Elton John, then this will hit the spot. Crank up the stereo and enjoy!
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|This is a great CD with a good collection of new songs.  Any Cher fan will enjoy adding this CD to their collection!
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|on the whole I like it, but there were holes in the story..... for instance why were humans not allow to land back on earth, did I miss something.... and that was just the beginning..... I do like Will Smith..... but this all just seems to be to choppy for me......
B003G4W49C|5.0|The book was great but very sad. I can't say mores because i would ruin the story. But the book was great!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This movie is just fabulous.  Nothing more needs to be said.  I recommend that anyone who does not have &#34;Miracle&#34; in their collection should add it.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I've had this app forever, and there was an update to it, but not for Kindle Fire. Now whenever I try to login, it says Login failed. I loved this app, and now I'm sad I can't use it. This was my only way of communicating to my friends who don't have facebook, and now it's not working. /:
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I love my Daria series. It comes with all the episodes plus two of the movies that came with Daria. This is prefect for people who are Daria fans.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Watch and enjoy, I hope they do extended editions like they did with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy as well.
B009KUWWW0|5.0|The plot keeps moving along with always another reason why you don't want to put the book down..Great  and varied cast of characters and I love a book that covers a longer time period of many years because you can pack so much more action and twists of fate into the story.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Superb writing.  Engaging characters...this author is a masterful storyteller.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end with no lapses. Do yourself a favor ... Read this book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book! It made me feel every emotion - sadness along with laughter. Great book for all ages.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I have been a Star Trek fan from the first television weekly episodes, and anxiously waited for each new broadcast.  This movie continues with the character interactions that made the series popular.  Since there is so little 3D programing I decided to send this copy back and buy instead the 3D Blu-ray set to add to my video library. I have large screen 3d 240hz awesome led tv with an awesome sound system. This purchase did not disappoint and the three disc package is very useful.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because of the hoops I had to jump through to get the digital copy. SO if you own a 3D tv, get this visual treat, sit back and enjoy.
0316204366|2.0|I have eagerly read all of Malcolm Gladwell's books.<br />Therefore I was eager to read this one.<br />In previous books he believed what he saw and told us about it.<br />In this book he melodramatically sees what he believes.<br />Some of the points he makes are quite valid and useful.<br />For instance is incarcerating people forever good for society?<br /><br />I find it quite sad that he is sinking as low to torture the facts until they confess to his theory when he has(had?) the intellectual firepower before to present us with the fresh insights we have come to know from him.<br /><br />I gained much more insight and understanding reading antifragile about why a David can beat a Goliath.<br />A two star because I am mad at the author since I expected more.Otherwise it would have been three stars.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Would have really liked this to be about twice as long. It's definitely worth reading, but I wanted more. More adventure, more fantasy, more of everything. Great world that Neil created, but over too soon.
B00F3WO0NS|5.0|The best show out there. It's well written and I love the cast. It keeps you coming back for more.
8866135909|5.0|I love this planner! Just the right size to fit in my purse and still large enough to actually write in. I'm very satisfied.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|A love story that will keep you guessing. Intertwined between a undying teen love story exists a complicated mystical world of dark and light magic. Two worlds of mortal and magic collide after a mortal boy and a caster girl fall in love. After tragedy their love and unworldly connection are put to the test. Fun read and didn't see the end coming at all!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed them my sister on the other hand did not find the first book well written or enertaining. she reads many books too.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|The movie was far out there but it was still enjoyable.  Lots of drama, action and a good story line.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Enjoyed great fast read would read them again have had many of my friends read as well.<br />my sister did not like them at all.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Don't be fooled about robots fighting instead of people.  This book IS about people, their lives, their problems,etc.  The Robots are just the icing.  You will find yourself rooting for the underdog robot just as if he were real.  GREAT MOVIE!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read all three within 3 weeks just thought it was very entertaining. kept my interest. would read them again whenget a chance
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|i think its good it has mad my dayband its such a huge game its like unbelievable its pure fun you should get it
B001U0HAYS|5.0|Was a gift and the person who received it loved it....would recommend this disc to someone else..a bit annoyed though that I have to type a certain amount of words.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is the very best way to keep in touch with people I never get to see as well pictures of their children
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Wonderful to read about what is truly important in life.<br />Anita writes with passion and clarity - a wonderful combination that is easy to follow.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Love this very engaging book and the true story. As an active hiker and recent trip on the PCT made it even more interesting.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|no major issues no bugs so far and no crashes but I just started with this app just need to make a way to earn coins faster so far so good! keep up the good work
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Fun game, I like how you gain energy back pretty fast.  It keeps you playing longer.<br />The game is well thought out and keeps you coming back for more.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|This is a wonderful gadget.  It's a solid weight that doesn't move on my desk except when I want it to, and it's a great way to adjust my volume without a bunch of mouse clicks or a new keyboard.  I also use it to scroll through documents and to have a one-button mute option that, again, doesn't require me to use my mouse.  The metal finish is very modern and striking, and the blue light (which varies in intensity as you turn the volume up or down) is a great finishing touch.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to any one considering it.
B009C5Z112|5.0|This album is truly mind blowing on so many levels! I know it's only five tracks but they are five VERY well thought out tracks. And I've been waiting 8 years for these five tracks! Jari's brain must be one big musical mad-house because the true depth of layers of every one of these songs is unbelievable! GET THIS ALBUM! HAIL! \m/
031623480X|5.0|Felt better the first day I tried the plan. Brain fog gone, irritability gone, alert and reading scientific papers right up until bedtime. Even at bedtime, not feeling \\"wiped out.\\" The books explains why I would be hungry within an hour of a big breakfast INCLUDING one waffle, but if I eliminate the waffle and just stick to a mushroom and cheese omelet plus any kind of meat (sausage, Canadian bacon, bacon...all without nitrates), then I wouldn't be hungry for hours. Even when you do get hungry, it's not all-consuming like a low blood sugar feeling.<br /><br />I would say that you don't have to \\"clear out your kitchen\\" as a first step as he says (potato chips, cereal, crackers, most chocolate except for the 70% or higher type). Instead, I left all that stuff on the shelves, poked around and tried certain recipes from the book (everything is delicious and now I crave nothing but real food). Point being, the stuff is still on my shelves but I don't even want it, both because I know what it does to your brain, but most of all because it's just not very appealing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book! It starts out a little slow at the beginning but once it gets started you won't want to put this book down!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This DVD looks terrific in 3D.  Lots of action. I enjoyed as much as I did in the theatre. If you have a surround sound system, it's even better.
B00594XOZU|1.0|this app is great on any other device but on kindle its crap, this app used to work but then one day it said &quot; oops sorry this is takeing longer than expected please try agian in a bit &quot; except when you do try agian in a bit it  never works!
B00E0SX118|5.0|Great Family Movie.  Entertaining For All Ages,  It Took Me A While To Recognize Nicholas Cages Voice.  Pass The Popcorn
B009C7JS14|5.0|its fast easy and dependable i use it all the time and it hasen't glitched yet its also great when you dont know what the weather will be like for the day
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I am wordless, since all the possibilities there are with this device. Google you did it.  Take Netflix and share it with everyone. You don't have to carry more than the phone and the Chromecast. (probably a WiFi router with you) / haven't tried that last one.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I could not put it down after starting the book. The contents were clear and decisive. It brought out all of my emotions<br />And knowing that even though the characters were fiction, 'the Orphan Train' was real.
193700788X|5.0|If you've read the series, you need to finish this out.  If you haven't read the series, go back and read a few or this will make little sense and have almost no &#34;heart&#34; for you.  A worthy end to a great series.  I look forward to the &#34;epilogue.&#34;
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|Dr. Strangelove is a brilliant encapsulation of the absurdity of government policy during the Cold War. I think one had to have lived through those times to fully appreciate the film, but if you did or are familiar with 1960s history, it is a must see. The casting is wonderful, ripe with personalities like Slim Pickens and George C. Scott and great performances from Peter Sellers and Sterling Hayden and Keenan &#34;Bat Guano&#34; Wynne. A young James Earl Jones also appears.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I stumbled upon this show by accident, and I've been hooked ever since.  I am now going back and watching earlier seasons, so that I can know more about each of the characters.  I absolutely ADORE Minnie - her simplicity and naiveté' is such a rare treat, and I can't help but laugh out loud at her comments.  Pure joy!  If you haven't caught on to this show yet, do yourself a great favor and check it out!
B008FRFN7A|1.0|Difficult and erratic to use. Not happy.<br />Hope the technology improves<br /><br />Won't use this much if ever<br />Can't print from it
B002RB7VMA|5.0|Michael Buble' is a pleasure to listen to. We have a picture of him with my daughter when he was performing in Boston.  Love the CD.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Excellent entertainment!  The narrators performance was superb.  I had to stop the playback until I finished laughing, so I wouldn't miss anything.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Great book - like the way it explains the impossible situations that we face in the sandbox and the way our politicians get our troops killed. I like the way SEAL training is described. The author honors the real heroes of Operation<br />Redwing..
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is fantastic and approaches how to tap into the universe in a fun way.<br />Doing the exercises is so enlightening - if you thing there's nothing there, think again.<br />I love Pam Grout's sense of humour.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I am new to Orson Scott Card's work. I decided to read Ender's Game when I heard about the movie coming out, and so in my mid-twenties I found myself really enjoying the book. I immediately wanted to find out what happens next, and so purchased the Kindle edition of Speaker for the Dead. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the book, but if you are an adult reader, you may find that you enjoy Speaker for the Dead more than Ender's game. It's more adult, with much more depth, and the plot is drawn out slowly. I found Card's depiction of this world to be much more descriptive than its prequel, and I really appreciated that aspect because I often felt the descriptions of the Battle School lacking and would go back to re-read passages to orient myself to be able to paint a picture of the action in my mind. I can't say much more than has already been said by other reviewers, but I would definitely encourage you to purchase this book if you are an adult reader or if, like me, you came to Ender's Game very recently and want to find out what happens next. I found the reading experience in Speaker for the Dead to be more immersive and, therefore, even more powerful.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Really fun game, where the sugar falls down, and you have to draw lines on the screen to redirect the sugar to the correct corresponding colored cups. Loads of fun, can be challenging, but persistence pays off.
B002RKSZS0|3.0|Since this is an early novel of Ms. Austin's, the wordiness can be forgiven. The story is interesting with twists and turns and more than the usual number of villains. Of course, the heroine has her happy ending.
6305090564|3.0|This movie is a fun action adventure romp with a really interesting monster and some nice bad guy action. Considering when it was made the special effects are good.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I liked this story-line a bit better than the original, but it still could not beat &#34;I AM THE LAW!&#34;
B008518MOW|5.0|This was far better than Men in Black 2.Has a new look and new operations to a lot of standards we come to expect. Spoiler alert, has time travel.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Loved re watching all the episodes when everyone was nerdy or how they all dated each other because of Glee. Definitely worth getting the DVDs.
B00E3D7WGU|1.0|The worst cd I have ever had..would love to send it back! Talentless...I tried to find a song that was ok...Don't waste your $
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Loved it in the theater and wanted my own Blu-ray copy plus the DVD and digital copy...the triple play is a bonus and a great deal on Amazon...
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I read this off of my kindle almost every day.  I have been told that the English Standard Version is a very good modern day translation of the original languages.
B005JABSB6|5.0|Originally got two pair of these glasses when we purchased our Sharp Aquos 60&#34; 3D TV from Best Buy and wanted to get more sets for when we have company.  Found out the hard way these glasses are the only ones that seem to work with my set.  It was actually for the best (pun not attended) because the glasses I initially purchased from Best Buy, per their recommendation - as they no longer carried this model, were not USB-chargeable but instead required a button cell battery and the fit wasn't as comfortable.  The original price was $60.00 and I was able to get them for a lower price from Amazon.  I could have gotten them slightly cheaper from eBay but they were being shipped from China and along with the shipping costs, which would have raised the price to within $5.00 of what I paid on Amazon, because of some Chinese holidays, the projected delivery date was almost a month later!  Being an Amzaon Prime customer, I not only received free shipping but they were at my front door in two days!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Read this book in 2 days. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read the next book! Amazing series!! :)
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I really like the new Star Trek series.  The actors and effects work well.  The script does a fine job of marrying the new actors with the first characters
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Simply brilliant. By far my favorite book by Jodi. Have a box of tissues. You will not put this book down.
B00BF2RV22|5.0|Even in failing health Miles does not disappoint as does the introduction to Wallace Roney.<br />That and what more can be said about Quincy Jones.<br />Despite being a 1991 production Eaglerock has done it again with astounding video and audio quality.<br />My only question is why so cheap perhaps the price and vintage are scaring many away.<br />This BR presents excellent value.<br />It's a must for any collector wanting a piece of the Miles magic and legacy.
B000FC1LOC|1.0|I was unimpressed but I also have known people with severe illnesses and have been exposed to the designer baby to save another child idea.  The writing was mediocre at best and there were multiple passages where subpar research was very evident.  I was expecting more from an author that holds a graduate degree and went to Princeton and Harvard and prides herself on her in depth research for her books.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Very fun and exciting.  Almost as good as the real thing and much less expensive.  I highly recommend it for anyone.
B00E9E4E50|5.0|The legendary Decca sound is alive and well on this disk. At times it sounds as if your right next to the piano. Especially on the Ballad 2. A musical and tonal delight. Well done Decca and Valentina.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I was very disappointed to see this book averaged only three stars. I preordered \\"Casual Vacancy\\" because, let's face it, I'll read anything J.K. Rowling writes. I think too many people did the same thing, hoping for and expecting the same type of can't-put-it-down experience with a wonderful cast of characters who are either evil or basically fantastic.<br /><br />\\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is nothing like that. What most people fail to remember is that the \\"Harry Potter\\" books were written for children and young adults. This is a VERY adult book with VERY adult problems. It's slow to start and easy to put down. It's also a joy to return to.<br /><br />Just because the characters are \\"petty,\\" \\"miserable,\\" or \\"snobby\\" does NOT mean they are inherently terrible or that, by the end, you don't find yourself loving a handful of them. I agree there were too many characters, but you eventually sort out who's who. Also, be advised: This book is SUPER British. If you don't like dialects or small-town British drama, then don't get the book.<br /><br />What's most disappointing is that most people who gave it negative reviews NEVER FINISHED THE BOOK! If you make it through the first third, you will want to finish. It's long, but J.K. Rowling is nothing if not a fantastic storyteller. The characters' lives intersect masterfully, and these characters are REAL. Like it or not, these are realistic emotions and problems. Petty? Sure. Depressing? Sometimes absolutely! But no matter how terrible they seem at times, the book is still very enjoyable and worth a read.
B000093BDX|5.0|If you like the Beach Boys songs this is the CD for you, it has lots of great songs on it. And the price is right.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Such a fun game, lots to it and will keep you interested. I play this game the most. Cool cool
B009A882D0|5.0|Its songs that I grew up with in my teenage years and it brings back thoughts of the good times my friends and I shared. And the price was great. If you like CCR this is a good one to have.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Easy to read and gives a new, better way to look at things. This book helped change parts of my life, for the better.
B0043URV5U|5.0|This CD has a lot of great songs on it that I grew up to listening to and driving my grandparents crazy with the music. Brings back good memories of days gone by.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It kept my attention and found it was easy to read the author did a good job writing this book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is way better than temple run and all other running games. It is tied for My favorite game. Probably my favorite game. Super fun!!!
B004EPZ07U|3.0|They took the cool elements of a space cop in a Star Wars/Star Trek like Superhero universe and brought our hero back to Earth to struggle through Daddy issues/fear which the mid boss villain was going through on a depressive scale. So they took the greatness out of it! All the good stuff happens in space and when our protagonist mans up which is half the movie, which is awesome but not the full movie unfortunately.<br /><br />Take my disclaimer on this film: If you are a fan or new to Green Lantern and want a good film of his then get [[ASIN:B0021AENJG Green Lantern: First Flight [Blu-ray]]] and you shall see what they could've should've done to surpass Iron Man or Thor in the box office as it's more action packed, character driven and even more gory than this film. A painful thing is that look at this cover! It's beautiful,...but you don't see much of those awesome looking Green Lanterns. You get all thats missing in this film in the animated feature which is on the scale of epic Disney quality direction, voice acting, animation, action & adventure.<br /><br />Only absolute merit of this film's existence is that it can act as a pilot for [[ASIN:B0081BEZXS Green Lantern: Animated Series - Season One Part 1]] followed by [[ASIN:B00BTJV9RO Green Lantern: Animated Show - Manhunter Menace]] and end it with [[ASIN:B004QOB8Q6 Green Lantern: Emerald Knights [Blu-ray]]] which delivers what one film should have delivered. So if you are a fan, get all these, but if not then go for First Flight. You will not regret it.<br /><br />BONUS NOTE: Hal had his movie, let's see John Stewart in the Justice League film! PLEASE WB!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Saddened by the ending but excited for the next book!! Looking so forward to book number two. I never imagined being so into a book. What an interesting way some people live.
B008CJ0KBU|1.0|Was not trilled that after a lot of effort on my part I could not get the above &#34;Lost Girl:The Complete Season 1&#34;. I kept getting &#34;Lost Girl:Season One.&#34;

1892005034|5.0|His style is captivating and it is one of those read through books and they .  Too far away to consult but there seems tp be a need to consult on these techniques.  He is simple yet wise.  Not an easy balance for me as a writer.  The content is captivating and useful.  This is a book that I will go through a book at a time until I absorbed till I come sounds
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I liked this book. There are no criticisms. The choice was made by a local book club. It was a very good choice.
B00EKHE1JA|1.0|Ever since I saw the 1989 movie 'Robot Jox'  at the age of ten in the theaters, I have been afraid of large robots and machines. Trying to leave the theater that day was quite the fiasco. My fear of being stepped on and squished like a pregnant Texas cockroach was debilitating. Complete loss of bladder control, sweats, and screaming like a school girl. My grandpa gave me some of his Jim Bean to help relax me and we finally exited the movie theater.<br />Years later, I have refused to see any movie similar. I thought  the animated 1999 movie 'The Iron Giant' would be therapeutic, but it's results were quite familiar. Grandpa and Jim Bean  were there to help me out of the theater that evening.<br />A few years later, grandpa died from an auto-erotic asphyxiation incident at a petting zoo with an emptied Jim Bean resting near his ankles. The theater he used to take me to was downgraded to a dollar theater serviced only by part-time workers since the theater could not afford full-time employees thanks largely in part to Obamacare.<br />Enter 'Pacific Rim.'<br />Much older now. I work near large machinery as there is an arcade next to the Hot Dog on a Stick that I work at in the mall. My boss Clair (who just graduated from high school) knew of my phobia and suggested that I confront it. She had learned in one of the classes from her single mother night school program that often times if we hold a similar, but relatively small  representational object to that which we fear most, it will give us a greater sense of control.<br />Anxious to overcome this fear, I took her up on the suggestion and purchased this 'Striker' figure to hold while I watched the movie 'Pacific Rim' at the dollar theater.<br />About ten minutes into the movie, I ran out of the theater screaming with the figure in hand.<br />No grandpa or Jim Bean to help me cope, but the figure remained close by.<br />I really do not feel that the figure offered any real value for it's intended purpose.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|It arrived exactly when it was promised and I am already enjoying it. Thanks so much!!! I now have my Husband hooked on it as well.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|This funny, quirky romantic comedy story has completely charmed me! Such a nice, light, and quick read! I really liked it and would recommend it!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|By this third season, our familiarity with the characters provides a deeper understanding of how societal changes  are influencing long held beliefs of what is expected or right. It makes for interesting drama as expected and expected situations confront these people.
B00000DR52|5.0|Very nice music from the movie, &#34;The Last Emperor&#34;. The music is powerful and haunting. It is also a pleasure to listen to. It is also very moving. I highly recommend this music for international music fans!
B00005JL96|5.0|Love this move always have. Couldnt find it any where so i bought it, the next day its free on Netflix lol.
B000000OAN|5.0|This is one of Queen's Best CD's!!! The great interplay of voices in operatic style are a must listen. This is a great CD for both old and new fans!. I would highly recommend this modern rock/opera!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Great movie a must see but have a box of Kleenex handy. Boy howdie, my husband and i both cryed .
B000GRUS22|5.0|This is an excellent CD by Enigma. It has great sounds effects and very intriguing music. I would highly recommend it for old and new Enigma fans!
B00BAXFCPO|2.0|I think the content of the book is fantastic. My gripe is with the Kindle edition. Where the author has used bullets for his text, the print is so light that it is barely readable. Also, there are several places in the text where \\"(here)\\" is printed. Was something supposed to be inserted \\"here?\\" Clearly, the Kindle version was not well proofed for errors.
B000002952|5.0|This is excellent Latin/Cuban &#34;son&#34; folk music by Gloria Estefan. Very heartfelt lyrics and music. I highly recommend it for old and new fans alike!
B000I0XLYO|5.0|one of ben stiller's best very funny look at male modeling with owen wilson and will ferrell a timeless classic
B008JF8O9M|2.0|I could not get this to work on my Kindle Fire tablet so I gave up and deleted it.  It did not seem very intuitive.
1419819364|4.0|This is a good film (but not great), but completely inappropriate for young children.  As I write this, my daughter is six years old.  I've read _Chocolate Factory_ and _Glass Elevator_ to her more times than I can count, but have never exposed her to the film adaptations.  I am glad I have not.<br /><br />There is simply too much conflict for young children.  All the children (except Charlie) exhibit inappropriate behavior for an extended period of time -- too extended for young children (unlike reading from the book). Near the end of the movie (1:35:27) we see a parent rejecting her child because she is blue.  Should a young child ever be presented with the idea that her parent would not love her?<br /><br />I won't discuss the Wilder version here, except to say that the first hour of the Wilder version is incredibly boring (setting up the acquisition of the ticket) and unfaithful to the book (the TV denunciation).<br /><br />While the Depp version is more faithful to the book, neither is it appropriate for kids.  There is too much conflict.  The Depp version has the TV denunciation at 1:30:05.  The song only lasts seconds, ending at 1:31:51.  The book version is much longer.  The film version references the shower scene from Psycho.  The music comes from Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody.  Dahl's message is grossly watered down in this film (to politely phrase it).<br /><br />If you have young children, read them the book, don't show them either of the movies.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK. It was very emotional and made me cry at parts but the end was a miracle as it uplifted me in a way no other BOOK could do. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a WONDERful thing to read.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm a 11 old boy and I thought this was a great book this has been the best book I have ever read
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Because it is a good game and you can be different characters such as Darth Vader, The Emperor, Anakin Skywalker, General Grievious and The Emperor's guard.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Downloaded app on iPhone first and loved it. The larger boards are harder to play on the smaller screen, but not impossible with a stylus. Much easier to navigate on my Kindle Fire and I get to start fresh. Definitely a go-to game for me when I have a few minutes wherever I am.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Got this game for both kindle and iPod. Why are the games different? Would like to have same stuff on both games
B003G4W49C|4.0|Written simply, however keeping in mind when it was written, I was able to admire the book for what it is, and how remarkable it would have been when written. It isa clever plot, and the twist was well done, and barely telegraphed. Certainly well worth your time if you like sci-fi. Even if you don't, I wager you will enjoy it as the human psychology in this book is interesting. My son is 7, and I think a 7 yr old is far more capable than we give them credit for. If all I had him do all day was study war, I think he would be darn good at it...just look how good kids are at video games with the casual time they put in. I think those that criticize the portrayal of kids in this book have likely never had children, or simply don't want to think what humanity is capable of at its core.<br />Where the book falls short is in the dialogue at times, and parts feel awkward when trying for the human connection (perhaps intentionally?).
B00C8USQEM|5.0|It's the Big Bang Theory.....Funniest show ever and now i can watch it from beginning to end ...as many time as i want!!!!!
B00E9P959O|4.0|Let me preface this review with the fact that I always loved Vapor Trails and hold the material on that album in the highest regard. In spite of the sound quality on the original, I have always ranked this album (to the surprise of others) as one of my favorite RUSH albums. For the quality of the songs and the musicianship alone, I place it on the level with other favorites such as RUSH, Fly By Night, Hemispheres, and Moving Pictures. And, the lyrics are quite possibly the best Neil ever wrote because they came from such an emotional place in his heart. This is of course clear to those who know the story of his loss and subsequent journey leading up to the release of this disc.<br /><br />I have been hoping for ten years that RUSH would re-mix this CD because of what a gem it could have been given the right polish. Now we finally have it in it's resuscitated state, with new life and all the sonic clarity we could have ever imagined, right? I'm afraid, sadly, no. Don't get me wrong. I love the fact that the band could have the courage to admit they allowed David Leonard (the original mix was so bad, I made it a point to memorize this name from the original credits so as to never to use him on any recording--should that big break actually arrive).* to drop a sonic stink bomb on their fans and go back to try and correct their mistake. Much appreciation to RUSH and their management and record companies for that! And, here is to say, I'm not completely dissatisfied with the result of the new mix. Overall, it's a VAST improvement over the original. It is money well spent. Buy it! But, when the sound quality of remastered analog recordings like \\"Fly By Night or \\"Caress of Steel\\" or \\"Hemispheres\\" (or for that matter, any digital recording of ANY Country artist in Nashville in the present age) are far superior in terms of the sonic clarity, one has to wonder \\"What's going on here?\\" Why can't that same clarity coming out of the new \\"classic rock & roll wearing cowboy hats\\" beapplied to bands like RUSH.<br /><br />Not to be too long winded here I'll summarize what I hear in some specific examples:<br /><br />1). The opening track, \\"One Little Victory,\\" has more clarity to the guitars which before sounded like a wash of white noise. (I remember when I first heard the track when it was released wanting to like it. \\"Those drums are incredible, but I can't tell if I like the song or not, because I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING BUT A WASH OF NOISE on guitars!\\"). A side-by-side comparison to the original, reveals that the sound of the drums on the original version of \\"One Little Victory\\" was so much more powerful than the drum sound in the re-mix. It almost sounds like a different kit. So if it wasn't broke, then why fix it?<br /><br />2). There is definitely more clarity to lead and backing vocals, but one song in particular, \\"Ghost Rider\\" that didn't need as much work as the others now has a very pronounced lead vocal at the beginning and the instruments are pushed back in the mix. That was one of the few songs on the original that was almost 100% listenable, and one of the strongest tracks on the album.  Again, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br /><br />3). I can hear a guitar solo and some backing vocal harmonies in \\"Ceiling Unlimited\\" that I never knew existed before. That's a good thing!<br /><br />To summarize:  Great improvement over David Leonard's original P.O.S. It was unnecessary to fix some of the positive things about the original and they got watered down a bit in the process. The vocals are much clearer and more discernible. The muddy-sounding white noise of Alex's guitars are cleaned up over the original, but not nearly enough for my taste. Finally, this is a masterpiece by one of Rock's greatest bands even if it was a rough demo on the original and now they have the real release! Go out and buy it and support these guys for a magnificent effort.
B001I189MQ|5.0|Again, Nolan wows audiences and fans with his rewarding re imagining of the caped crusader. The movie features outstanding directing, as with the entire trilogy, and again the a-list cast delivers incredible acting. The true gem of this title, however, is Heath Ledgers revolutionary portrayal of the Joker. His immersion and dedication to the character makes him truly one of the best movie villains and displays how he may be one of the greatest actors of our time. This sequel truly is the best batman movie, Heath Ledger is truly shown to be a fantastic actor, and in truth this movie may be one of the greatest of our time
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I haven't had a chance to watch the 3D version as I don't have a 3D tv, but otherwise it is great.

B00FHG19T8|5.0|Perfectly composed and written, and instrumentally a masterpiece! Amos Lee never disappoints and this is his best one yet. An excellent fusion of funk, blues, gospel and country rolled into one beautiful album.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|i like it , i used to play it on my phone ,it i so much better on my Kindle. cool game and I'd tell others about it , and because im a prime member i got it for free.

B001NVIZ3E|5.0|Errol Flynn IS Robin Hood (ha -- this is one time I feel this can truly be said).  Erich Wolfgang Korngold's wonderful musical score, and beautiful cinematography alone would win anyone's heart (also Michael Curtiz's great directing).  But Errol Flynn is the personification of chivalry and the best romantic hero.  What a movie!  Melvin Cooper is great comic relief; Claude Rains is great no matter what he's in, and the same can be said of Basil Rathbone.  Sure, it's fantasy all the way (including Patric Knowles playing a stringless instrument), but who cares?  Littlejohn, Friar Tuck -- well, the entire ensemble (not forgetting Olivia De Havilland in one of her more beautiful, if not best scripted, roles) -- a great movie, superb entertainment.  Many Robin Hood movies have been made; there is none to touch this one.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|Blu-ray disk does not play on my Samsung player. Sent it back and tried again with a different disk and the same result.<br /><br />Great movie !!!!!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Really get involved with the creative process of the game, but the cost of the pearls is nothing less than outrageous.
B003K15IF8|5.0|While the reader may not like the plot, the character(s), or the development, the language and the author's talent for creating an understanding of the characters is brilliant.  Invariably reviewers bring up Hemingway.  I don't think that comparison works.  I think you'll find that you can't tinker with the sentences or paragraphs without ruining what you've touched.  The story is about a college teacher and his 40 years of teaching and his somewhat unhappy life.  You can put the book down at any point, you just can not get it out of your mind.  You can walk away from it, but you wind up coming back and being drawn in by the author's talents in telling a story and his use of language.  Well worth your time and the read.
B008Y212PI|3.0|Similar to Picross. Pretty short though and kind of easy. Overall though it was worth the download. Good but not great.
B008Y212PI|4.0|The premise of the game is simple. It's a simple puzzle game.  The pictures aren't involved in solving the puzzles. They are just there for show, basically.still, I found I it highly diverting.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|It's a very fun game, with very simple controls and plenty of variety. The learning curve is very friendly, and the difficulty curve is very gradual.<br /><br />That said, be prepared to put it down and walk away from time to time. If you're anything like me, you'll get obsessed with a level and pretty soon you've run through it several dozen times and you're getting angry. Just put it down. I've been stuck on Io for TWO WEEKS (after typically going through 3-4 levels a day). I've probably run through the level 200 times, and I just don't see any way to make that last jump. Two of my friends are playing the game as well, and they're stuck in the same place. So it's easy to get bent out of shape, but just come back to it another time. Don't let the fun turn to frustration, because this is a game that can do it.<br /><br />Have fun!
1476729085|5.0|I work in technology, and although I have serviceable social and professional skills, I am a bit of a closet (albeit mild) Aspie.  This book resonated with me, as even though I am nowhere near as differently-abled as the protagonist, I can strongly relate because I am a slightly 'on the spectrum'.<br /><br />Without discussing the plot in detail, this book is an enjoyable and amusing read from the first to the last page.  It was a quick read, but not disposable. I was laughing so much and so often that my wife started reading it on her Kindle before I was finished with it on mine, so we had to arbitrate 'most recent page' settings between our devices.<br /><br />I knew almost nothing about the book when I picked it up, and was surprised after a few dozen pages to realize that the character (and the author) were Australian. There is no heavy use of local patois - perhaps it was edited for the US audience, but it reads, with very small exception, as if it were written by a US author.<br /><br />Don Tillman, the main character in The Rosie Project, can be described as a cross between Sheldon from Big Bang Theory and John Nash from A Beautiful Mind.  Don wants a wife, and in his first few decades of living he has had limited success with the opposite sex, so he decides to attack the problem in the most coldly logical way he can think of - as a Project (with a capital 'P').<br /><br />Suffice it to say that the softer sex doesn't necessarily respond well to being rated, classified, and/or eliminated as a spousal prospect based on cold calculation, and thereby hangs the tale.<br /><br />If I had any criticism at all, it's that the book seems to end rather abruptly. Part of that feeling was that I wanted the book to go on (because of how enjoyable a read it is), but part of that feeling is also that it seemed that the ending was accelerated a bit, and the author could have tarried a bit and strung out the home stretch a bit more.<br /><br />However, that's mostly a nit-pick, not a true criticism, and I heartily recommend this as an engaging and amusing read.k, not a true criticism, and I heartily recommend this as an engaging and amusing read.
B0091WS2DK|5.0|A must-see if you like Ayn Rand, or if you want to introduce yourself to her philosory and the wonderful life of living in the real world.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I've been using, and learning, for just a short time. But this is already is my go to idea space.
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|Great table! The kids And neighbor kids love it too! I would def recommend a dark room though, because you won't be able to see the glow.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|My town did not get the theatrical release so I was very excited to have it come out on DVD - I love it!  It works so well with the actors Whedon selected....such a great interpretation of the Bard....I also like it with the accompanying book that I used to follow the script.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I have been enjoying Downton.  It is a wonderful mix of watching the life of the royals and also the life of their servants. We love Amazon Prime because we can watch shows at our leisure.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Simple, fun and efficient. Try it, it does work. The experiments are  easy and they also work.<br /><br />God bless you Pam
B00F52YOPA|5.0|This is the best hidden object game to come out. Fun to play especially when you have to sit around a Dr.'s office for ever.Game is lighter and objects bigger so makes it all easier. Not as much  eye strain. I would recommend this easily to hidden object lovers!
B008RXYOKY|5.0|This cable adapter is a no brainer if you've got older, Firewire only external drives and a new Mac. Does exactly what it's supposed to do.
B004W1GCQO|3.0|I began watching Upstairs because I enjoy Dowton Abbey so much.  Judging from the first episode Upstairs it is lacking.<br />The production values and the depth of the characters are Dowton 'lite&#34;.  In fairness the latter may improve with further episodes.  However, the characters in Dowton hooked me in episode 1.  In Upstairs I came away with no interest in what happened to the characters.<br />I also believe that Amazon is trying to profit from Upstairs on the coat tails of Dowton.  While I watched the first three seasons of Dowton on Amazon Prime instant video, Amazon is charging $2 for each episode of Upstairs.  That's like giving you a great, free strawberry shortcake, and the next time charging you for just the bowl.<br />I'm not buying the bowl.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|This is a nice and simple rendering of UNO, players come from all over and it plays simple and easy.  I do not like that players have to buy chats and such with their points, but it's ok.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|This is clearly the best Kakuro game I've seen for Android. I play it on a Galaxy tab 2 10.1 so the game grid fits well and buttons are easy to use. I can't think of any improvements to add to the game.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Just a really gossipy book about everyone's problems.  I just skimmed through it just to find out the husband's secret.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Wow what a great movie! It has everything a guy could want in a movie. Sexy women, guns, swords, demon samurai, German zombie soldiers, airships, orcs, knights, dragons, planes, helicopters, robots...
B000VUCIZO|5.0|Every young father and mother should read this book to learn the importance of sharing their &#34;how-tos&#34; with their children.  Wozniak has no airs about his talent and his zest for life and learning is inspiring.
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|As usual, Dexter was well written, directed, shot, and acted. I really enjoyed the performance of Yvonne Strahovski. It took me awhile to place her from Chuck. She was very good and the chemistry with Dexter was great.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|I really liked the first half of the book. It is very thought provoking, much like his other books. It made me re-think some things. His analysis on teaching and education was very intriguing.<br /><br />But the book seemed to get stuck in the mud during the discussions about civil rights and about the fighting in Ireland. The stories bounced back and forth, and were more drawn out than the earlier, more succinct discussions. It was harder to follow, the conclusions seemed less impact full, and frankly, I started to get bored. I was somewhat disappointed with this one.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I purchased the subscription of two magazines and loved the outlook of reading them on my android tablet. However, the application does not display the content, just blank pages and a frozen spinner. Reading through the Amazon forums, I realized I'm not the only with this problem, and unfortunately the updates, both the application and the tablet software, do not change the situation.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading this book. Finished it in 1 day. Could barely put it down. Time for the 3rd book
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|one of the best mob movies ever, especially since it's based on a true story!  Even better than another of my favorites, The Godfather.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|The book was just ok.  It kind of touted itself as a new thinking on Jesus, mainly historical but there was nothing really new in it.  The &#34;historical Jesus&#34; has been out there for eons.
B000T433CO|5.0|I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it.  It is a great, warm, good-feeling movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show and can't wait for the next season to start, I'll be watching every episode!  Love it!
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|I am a huge JT fan and absolutely love this Christmas CD. It is a staple in my house all season long, we never get sick of it! His version of &#34;Here Comes the Sun&#34; with Yo-Yo Ma is incredible.
B008D30K7E|4.0|I liked the 'Del Boy' character of the old man and his mates. There were considerable historical and political referemces told from an amusing angle. I laughed a lot, it was and entertaining book.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Story was good difficult to follow who was doing what sometimes the way it jumped from one person to another.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|I read all the reviews and was not sure I made the right decision for my grandson. It worked out perfectly and he enjoys playing with all the toys, looking around, and jumping.
B00EDX5QNG|5.0|For immediate disclosure of my ignorance, I was drawn to this album because of Nicolas Jaar. Only by the the power of the internet I learned about Dave Harrington. The generous will hopefully see this as a 'yes' moment, when two musicians that inhabit complementary yet distinct circles, through collaboration, have drawn people together. I consume my share of blogs and follow a cluster of sites dedicated to music. Ultimately and, I suspect, inevitably, I fail at grasping the entirety of great talent that exists, regardless of genre. Not that I aspire to connect all the dots. It is impossible. If only I could taste slivers, millions of slivers, of contemporary music, however small. Perhaps then, even if I did not know it all, I would know enough. Yes, I am a dabbler. I like this and that. I am not the guy who follows every musician inside the (for example) Joy Division gravitational pull. But that is not to say that I do not fall deeply in love with a song, an album, or a musician.<br /><br />Darkside's Psychic is Nicolas Jaar and Dave Harrington being awesome. Excellent music writers writing for excellent music sites have already said excellent things about this music. High satisfaction. I love Jaar's sense of texture. I love the clarity with which Jaar can convey emotion while playing with a rich texture. Imagine a painter using thick blobs of paint, richly strewn across the canvass, bright blue orange red green yellow, coalescing into one very simple structure. In the 1890's, rural southern France, it might be a church. I am not equating Jaar with Van Gogh. But I see a shared fascination of how the texture and color, enriched, are a source of meaning and clarity. I love it.<br /><br />But I've been \\"all about\\" Jaar. Only because I know Jaar - or at least I have known *of* Jaar before Harrington. But now, given this album, I want to know about Harrington.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Great plot. Never saw the story line twist coming. i find it disappointing he took out the light in his chest. That made him iron man.
B0035HKWLW|2.0|Over acting as usual, (Jim) by one of the great over actors of our time.  Ace, and Lloyd are still super funny...  This was a bit tedious.
1564029654|5.0|This is my daughter's and my favorite book.  It's not terribly lengthy with really nice illustrations.  I think that it makes a great gift to give to others parents as well.
B00760BPOC|3.0|I have just finished the book and I feel that the writer is starting to loose their way on how to finish
B00B2V66VS|5.0|even though I'm not that good at it, I still find it a very entertaining and addicting game. everyone should download it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like subway surfers but when I try to update it it acts crazy, but other than that it is fine.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|this is by far the most well used alarm clock in my family so please use and get it you will not regret it
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Great acting, amazing flight sequence... But a dark, even sad reality evolves...  True for too many dealing with this.  Ultimately, a shocking but fitting end.
0399230033|3.0|There's is very little text to read.  So my hubby and I just end up making it up as we go along, which my daugher really seems to enjoy also.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Once into the story we couldn't wait to see the next episode and are anxiously waiting to see Season 4
B0046B3QTG|3.0|Not as cleverly done as some other animated films but still enjoyable.  Don't sweat it if you don't see it right away.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Didnt work - I think I have an older version of HDMI on my TV :(  sold it to a friend
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really got caught up in the story theme.  I read it out of order though.  Start with book 1. It is better when you have the background. info
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|The best movie I watched last months. It makes you think, it depply touches. Compliments to the director! It is definitely worth your time!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent novel. In true King fashion. Only 10 days in, and I find it hard to put down. But, I have bills to pay so I have to work sometime.
B00EP2PXCY|4.0|Was surprised at how many of the songs I actually liked on the CD.  Love her voice she still reminds me of a younger Mariah!
B008EKOIN8|4.0|I saw the author on TV and I decided to read the book. I'm not done yet but so far it's interesting.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|I'm starved for t.v. and movie entertainment that is clean and doesn't need to stoop to sex or horror to tell a story.  Thank you for making a interesting story line with interesting characters!
B00AHH0XOY|5.0|The movie is fun to watch.  Voice acting is great.  Overall a great movie to watch with the kids.  Enjoy!
B000FCKPHG|5.0|I thought this was smart, well written; thoughtful, useful.<br />can be applied to and explained to young children or teens or adults.
B00AEBBA72|4.0|I'm not necessarily a huge fan of Tim Burton, but I absolutely respect his craft and what he does.  This might be my favorite of his movies. This movie is a perfect culmination of Burton's imagination combined with a timeless tale of horror.  The Cinematography and the Art Direction are so perfect for the story that is being presented.  It has a dream-like quality and lends to the feeling that you are not just watching a movie but rather that someone is retelling a ghost story.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I absolutely love this version of Sherlock Holmes. Its witty,  and intellectually stimulating. Funny as well. I hope there are many more seasons to follow.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I just got this a few hours ago, and I can easily see myself spending all my free time playing it from here on out...
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I am huge on music that I can listen to the entire album. Well this is just that. I enjoy every single song. Emeli does not disappoint, voice is powerful and sensitive. She deliver flavor and passion with her word that is sung.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|It does not matter what I think.it's a #1 best seller.the story of Jesus in the book reads like a history book.to me that's a good thing.I like reading about history.take away the biblical aspects of the bible and you still have a story of a good man.a man that cared for people.the book is a good read.the bottom line here is that there nothing new.it's the story of Jesus Christ.the only disappointment about the book is you kinda think there be something added to the Jesus story and there is nothing new.Frank  Evans
B00FN811SY|5.0|so useful for ministry  thanks I will use this extensively to help myself and others come to know good news
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This is the best game ever and it's really fun you do funny things and sometimes if you do it wrong you die so that's a funny thing awesome game
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very different way to tell a story!  Was hesitant in the beginning but as the story enfolded you became more involved with the characters.  Totally different way to view WWII and the German people.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Great small book. Easy to read and it kept me very interested. Did not take long to read the book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the first review I have ever written - usually don't stop and take the time - but I must for this App!  IT IS AWESOME.<br />Very stable and reliable. Functionality is great. Easy to pick up and begin to use immediately. Great bookmarking and storing by topic called \\"labels.\\" I'm in 24/7 ministry and this being on my phone is truly a Godsend for me. Thank You! YouVersion.
B001EC2J0C|5.0|Sex, abuse, alcoholism, mental illness, death, class tension, wondrous music, unforgettable acting, this movie based on Tennessee Williams' play is phenomenal, and one of my all time favorites. Apart from the fact that its poignant message about domestic violence and mental illness (and a woman's, no less!) is extraordinarily before its time, the brilliant dialogue, casting, etc. are terrific and horrifying. Due to certain pressures of having to appease the forces that be, certain aspects were changed from the original: (spoilers:) including the ending, and details regarding Blanche's young husband's sexuality. These would have made for a more powerful experience, but Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando's smouldering, deranged duality and Kazan's filming is enough to make for a momentous film.
B004AQR29C|2.0|Pretty bad plot covered up with lots of explosions. Plot is very jumpy. Plenty of well-known actors with some irrelevant cameos.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Great family movie...for adults too!  It contains many controversial topics which are presented in a very palatable manner.  Great to relax, watch and just have fun.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Currently I am getting a message saying that I am using an old app and when I try to install a newer version my Kindle freezes...finding this more than a little frustrating.
B007THA4FI|3.0|So many characters and so much going on, hard to put aside and pick back up.  Good characters relative to this time of our lives and things going on.
B00FFRAKRG|4.0|Korns heaviest CD to date,... having &#34;Head&#34; back in the band helps, Not as many radio friendly tracks, but a true Korn fan can appreciate that. The CD with the bonus interview tracks (video) is a must have if you're really into the band, btw, Jonathon has never sounded better! ♫
B00B8YSIMY|3.0|Has the germ of a really great story but needs an edit.  A good rollicking read with a few glitches that de-rail it from being a 21st century 'Trainspotting'.  The author's insight into the world he writes about is eerily accurate. (*shudder*)
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Best movie that has come out in a while. Action filled with a little romance tossed in. Perfect for sister night!
B009NH6JRE|5.0|One of my favorite series.  I have purchased the other seasons too for my collection.  I am a fan and recommend buying this.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game - great for those times when 'switching off' is required, and so very easy to pick up and put down...very addictive.
B001TM14VC|5.0|This movie really takes me back!  It's a great story and a great soundtrack too!  It's always good to see every now and then :)
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|They should have stopped with II.  I just felt cheated even at a rental fee of less than 4.00.  Just because a formula works for 2 movies, there is a time to stay enough is enough.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Corey gets a little tiresome with his constant wisecracks, but dang it, they are funny. The plot reveals at a satisfying pace, like all of DeMille's stories.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Great game except it relies to heavily on invest points and facebook posts. I have plenty of money to expand but not enough invest points. You should be able to buy invest points with the game money.
020530902X|4.0|The book came in great condition, although a few of the pages were a bit wrinkled, but that didn't bother me. and it came in the day it was said to arrive, I needed this book for one of my classes and it was not as expensive as at my university book store! a
B004IFYMWK|3.0|The movie was nothing like I thought it would be.  It was more like a documentary and not very satisfying at all.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great book with twists and turns along the way! I can't wait to start on the companion book.  This book was the best I have read so far this year..and I have read many.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|As a newer fan of Korn since \\"Remember Who You Are\\" to now, I have to say that \\"The Paradigm Shift\\" is a truly great cd regardless of genre! The songs gel very good together to form a wonderful cd that grabs your attention and doesn't let go. It's well balanced in the sense that it's heavy and intense but also lets up enough to let you recover until the next attack. Sometimes a \\"heavy\\" cd loses it's impact of heaviness if it constantly bombards you with pounding guitars and drums until your senses turn numb. (KoRn's 2010 release Remember Who You Are suffered a bit from the constant bombardment)<br />It seems now KoRn thankfully is mature enough to know the appropriate time to pound you over the head and when to lightly slap you across the cheek.<br /><br />If you love metal you should get this cd.<br />If you love rock you should get this cd.<br />If you loove pop music you should get this cd as it still has the catchy choruses but in a much more \\"awesome\\" soundscape compared to say, Britney Spears.<br />If you love country you should get this cd as it might wake you up to something great finally.<br />If you love hip hop......well you can at least like that KoRn has a good focus on rhythm.<br /><br />This easily belongs in the top ten rock/metal releases of 2013!
B00874T02K|3.0|Simple app, great purpose though. I would suggest this app for anyone trying to improve these exercises, it will help hold you to it.
B005UT29Z0|5.0|Well acted, good actors.<br />My husband, who is difficult to please, especially when it comes to the predictable Hollywood productions that generally prevail, was very complimentary. In conclusion, it was nice to find a movie we would both enjoy.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I think its good to kill time. Very good campaign. And its just a little hard to get resources. Also pop ups are a little annoying.
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|Sorry, but it's true. I'm a long-time fan. This album has a lot of familiar noises. Any listener who has heard the sound of Nine Inch Nails throughout the past two decades will surely pick up on these repeat sounds. For someone with a synthesizer the aural landscape should be limitless, so I'm really not sure why I can play this album and feel like I have heard it already. The same way The Slip left practically zero memory imprint on me, I am resigned to realizing that this album will similarly slip in and out of my earholes and disappear.<br /><br />Go ahead, name the best song on The Slip. Now tell me which track off this album will be played live three years from now.<br /><br />To be totally fair, \\"Copy of A\\" and \\"Everything\\" are pretty cool. Still, these are two songs that stand out more due the ordinariness of the surrounding tracks rather than standing out for their own EXTRAordinariness. If this was some new band's debut album I seriously doubt it would draw enough critical acclaim to make any sort of splash. Just sayin'.
B00BCOQSSQ|1.0|Very badly written (a few examples: “the . . . sun beamed down on my skin,” “a fun sight to see,” “a hoard [instead of horde] of people,” “the typical wear from middle age”). I made it almost halfway through this book before giving up. The narrative method is erratic and jerky. We go back and forth between college student Owen, a former Fron turned Keeper (Frons in their natural state resemble those happy Whos down in Whoville), and moments when Owen is snatched away from his friends to meet with the Keeper. We never know when to expect these meetings nor why they happen when they do. Neither are we ever told exactly what Owen and his friends are supposed to do. They must stop the incursion of the evil “Them,” villains never more specifically identified. They join odd clubs on campus where they receive undescribed training in unidentified skills. The skies darken. Huff gives us no character development. Rather, static characters go through a series of experiences that mostly involve eating, listening to lectures, and undergoing the aforementioned nonspecified training. Making all of this worse is the poorly edited writing. I think I will collapse of boredom long before Them can do me any damage.
B006C45CFG|5.0|I grew up on shootemup westerns and science fiction...this was a great spoof with some really good, no, make that excellent actors and acting.  The aliens were awesome too....
B0055B7IPE|4.0|Wholesome family movie that tells a good tale.  It's nice sometimes to just sit back, relax, and let yourself get caught up in a fanciful story.
B00F88H5K2|4.0|I really wanted to see this movie and waited for it to become available. It was about halfway worth the wait. Liberace is an interesting character to me and Michael Douglas does a good job playing him. Interesting expose of his life.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Like many Kindle apps that interact with the internet, it constantly crashes.  If not for that, it appears to be a well designed app.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I highly recommend this book to everyone. I finished it in three days and it was one of those books that I could not put down. I never wanted this book to end. The storyline can be complicated at times, but it draws you in and makes you believe. I'm planning on buying the paperback soon so I can read it over and over again.
B000I186FW|5.0|Great movie! Natalie Portman did a phenomenal job acting. The overall movie is so good you'll want to watch it twice.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Perfect for your late night mindless viewing fix: Good legal stories and good acting-so far only available on Amazon . Enjoy
B005LAIIGM|5.0|I think that, \\"Gravity,\\" really was the best science fiction movie I've ever seen, because, just as a friend of mine with whom I experienced this film said, \\"it wasn't science fiction,\\" but a real life kind of very possible scenario. The realism of the story, the acting, the script, the direction and every other aspect blended together into a truly enthralling, emotionally exhausting and very inspirational film experience. Sandra Bullock was magnificent and George Clooney was perfect in the role he played. Also the musical score was exquisitely beautiful and complementary to the story. In my view, the movie was flawless. It is a must see on the big screen.  2D is quite sufficient a medium to really experience and appreciate this film.  I've come to the place, after many times of viewing movies in 3D, that the 3D experience is highly over-rated and at best distracting, and at worst, usually played unbearably loud.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Season 2 is really good.  Love Donna!  Harvey is also the man.  I really liked how they starting showing a different side to him
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I choose this rating because Shazam is the best. Did not know about it until it was introduced to me. It helped me a lot because I didn't know a lot of the songs. Would recommend to my friends.
B0084670FU|5.0|I wasn't quite sure when I started to watch the movie whether I would like it, but it turned out to be riveting drama.  Well done.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Looking forward to not having to hook up my PS3 to watching Netflix.  It will be so much better and faster.
B00004R99U|5.0|The movie was wonderful. My kids truly enjoyed it. We are so glad we added it to our movie night collection.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|I was looking for an app that would tell me the weather of my home country for days and I finally found it!! It tells me what the weather of other countries in days
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Great story and acting. No dry eyes at the end. The behind the scenes was interesting as well given that it is a true story.
B001NIA27E|4.0|An oldie but goodie! It's such a good movie. They really don't make them like this anymore either. Pierce Brosnan is a great actor.
B000002OOY|2.0|Sound track was complete but overall sound volume level was quite low. I used the sound track as background sound in a video I made from a trip to Maui.
B000002JSH|5.0|I originally bought the vinyl in '76 and still play it although the sleeve is a bit dog-eared.<br />I bought the CD so I could play it in the car when I go to fetch my old age pension!<br />It is my view that Straight Shooter and Led Zeppelin 2 are the two best rock albums of all time, but don't forget that there is some other excellent music out there.<br />I loved the one star review that said Bad Co sounded country and western. What a moron! And yes, since it has been pointed out to me I suppose some of the lyrics are a bit basic but so what!<br />This is a must have for any music collection.
031606792X|5.0|The book is captivating and kept me mesmerized. One of my favorites from the Twilight novels. Always leaves me looking forward to the next book she writes.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Somehow the misfortunes that weigh down the hero seem a bit much for him to turn out to be a such good guy.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|I LOVE this cd!!  I read that Lana sounds like she has been kidnapped and on drugs and I agree..mix that was right on key!!  I can close my eyes and listen to her incredible cover of Blue Velvet and feel like I've been transported to a street cafe on a rainy night in Paris watching a beautiful French couple groping in front of my table!!  Being somebody who has heard thousands of hot singers and incredible cd's LANA DEL REY STILL IS A STAND OUT WITH HER DREAMY VOCALS AND SOMETIMES TWISTED LYRICS ALL WRAPPED UP INTO ONE ODD EXPERIENCE!!  I would recommend this CD to anyone who dares to venture outside the confines of typical pop music.  You may have thought you heard it all but you haven't if you never heard this CD!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I found this version of the Bible well organized and a easy read. The order was perfect and the type was legible.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I gave this book a five star rating because it is by far the most moving book that I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. While the writing doesn't necessarily follow textbook grammar, its story consistently elicits emotions which is the goal of all entertainment. As the story progresses, the pacing becomes more intense. The story is structured near-perfect and follows Joseph Campbell's Heroes with a Thousand Faces. The hero has clear mental and physical goals and the plot ending is totally unexpected, perfect.
B0000640VM|5.0|The movie was wonderful. My kids truly enjoyed it. We are so glad we added it to our movie night collection.

B0033H7VI6|5.0|Sharp solid, well constructed at a reasonable price.  Its my Blind Horse knife, but it also isn;t over $200.00  Great spine for a fero rod and very comfortable in the hand.  Batons well, and is sharp enough out of the box to skin game.  Balance isn't bad if you have to throw in an emergency.  I've planted mine solidly in Oak, with relative ease

0385523912|4.0|This story was quite an incite into the lives of North Koreans.  The author chose different people with different views of how well the North Korean regime treated them and whether or not they were happy with their lives.  Most said no .  Some worked on leaving the country.  It was difficult.  What I enjoyed reading was an inside view.  You have to want to understand the reason the author chose to write about this.

B00D2MC8WG|4.0|Maybe it's a sign of Dudamel's growing maturity that this present collection of well-known Richard Strauss tone poems with the Berlin Philharmonic is actually a lot more reflective and lyrical than you might expect from the conductor. It's also perhaps a sign that Dudamel wanted to play to the strengths of the older orchestra members. Or it's a sign of respect for the orchestra's other major recordings of Zarathustra (for DG and Decca) under the celebrated Herbert von Karajan. After all, Dudamel no doubt knew that many listeners would be comparing his DG recording with Karajan's, especially the later digital one. He didn't want to sound like the new kid on the block trying to show off and falling on his head.<br /><br />This is not say, however, that Dudamel's recording surpasses all others. For my money, there are still any number of conductors who have essayed these Strauss works to at least slightly more telling effect. Let's start with the first piece on the program, and I'll try to explain.<br /><br />German composer and conductor Richard Strauss (1864-1949) wrote the symphonic poem Also Sprach Zarathustra in 1896, his inspiration a philosophical novel by the philosopher and poet Friedrich Nietzsche. Strauss divided the music into nine sections, naming the sections after various chapters of the book.<br /><br />It might be best, though, not to put a lot of stock in the literal meaning of each of these sections but instead to enjoy them for their figurative spirit. In fact, Strauss himself, whom some people criticized at the time for trying to put Nietzsche's philosophy into music, said, \\"I did not intend to write philosophical music, or to portray in music Nietzsche's great work. I meant to convey by means of music an idea of the development of the human race from its origin, through the various phases of its evolution, religious and scientific, up to Nietzsche's idea of the superman. The whole symphonic poem is intended as my homage to the genius of Nietzsche, which found its greatest exemplification in his book, Thus Spake Zarathustra.\\" Fair enough.<br /><br />Now, to Dudamel's interpretation of Zarathustra. While maintaining Strauss's spirit, evoking a good deal of sympathy for Nietzsche's ideas, and sounding thoughtful, poignant, and at times quite elegant, the reading still isn't quite as dramatic as Reiner's (RCA, HDTT), as exciting as Solti's (Decca), as contemplative as Haitink's (Philips), as rhythmically compelling as Previn's (Telarc), as clearheaded as Kempe's (EMI) or Blomstedt's (Denon), or as radiant as Karajan's own (the two for DG and the several for Decca). I mean no disrespect to Dudamel; his is a fine interpretation. He's just up against a ton of good competition. And if it's sound alone you're after, it's hard to beat the Newport Classic/AUracle Binaural disc with Jorge Mester and the Pasadena Symphony (NCAU-10001).  Sonically, that recording knocks the socks off any other, if sonic sock-knocking is your idea of a good time.<br /><br />The fact that DG afford Dudamel a live recording doesn't do him any favors him, either, particularly in Zarathustra. The sound is fairly close up (presumably to minimize audience noise), with an enormous dynamic range but a relatively mild deep bass. You may not be able to notice it on the excerpt below, the famous Introduction to the piece, but it begins at such a low level, it may tempt you to reach over and raise the gain. It's an organ-pedal note that's barely audible here at normal listening levels. If you increase the volume, though, you face a crescendo a moment later that will knock you out of your seat or possibly damage your speakers. Certainly, while every audiophile wants a wide dynamic range, this may be too much of a good thing and sounds a little artificial in the process, smacking more of the control booth than the concert hall.<br /><br />Anyway, moving along, whenever I listen to Zarathustra I can't help thinking of the old definition of an \\"audiophile\\" as one who listens only to the \\"Introduction.\\" Well, ever since 2001: A Space Odyssey who can blame anybody; it's the only part most people know. Surprisingly, the \\"Introduction\\" isn't Maestro Dudamel's strong suit; he actually seems most comfortable with the more poetic, more touching elements of the score. Under his direction \\"The Backworldsmen\\" segment comes off gracefully; \\"The Great Longing\\" is appropriately wistful yet optimistically grand; \\"Of Joys and Passions\\" could be a tad more intense; \\"The Song of the Grave\\" sounds a bit rushed but carries a sincere conviction; \\"Of Science and Learning\\" displays a sweet, singing lyricism; \\"The Convalescent\\" produces suitable emotion and vitality; \\"The Dance-Song\\" exhibits a pleasantly lilting if sometimes curiously halting gait; and the concluding \\"Song of the Night Wanderer\\" wraps things up in Strauss's own subdued, luminescent manner.<br /><br />Maestro Dudamel takes his time through the two couplings, Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks and Don Juan, sometimes taking parts of them at a surprisingly leisurely gait. They don't sound slow or labored, however, despite their timings being a few minutes longer than those of most other conductors. Instead, Dudamel carefully builds up the pictorial elements, apparently having great fun with the melodramatic, almost cinematic, qualities of both pieces.<br /><br />Throughout these proceedings, the Berlin Philharmonic demonstrate why many people consider them the greatest orchestra in the world. They perform flawlessly, producing a rich, lavish, robust, yet cultivated sonic canvas that is quite glorious to hear.<br /><br />DG made the recording live in January and February of 2013 in the Great Hall of the Philharmonie, Berlin. As I said earlier, the miking is fairly close, as it is for most live productions, so we don't get much sense of hall ambience or depth to the orchestra. We do, however, get excellent clarity and openness, with ultraclean definition, and a very wide dynamic range. Maybe too wide for the preferences of some listeners. Audience noise is almost nil (you'll hear only occasional background rustling), and the engineers spare us any applause, even at the end of the program.<br /><br />John J.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel.  Not having read any of Hosseini's previous efforts, I was not sure what to expect.  I  was hooked from the first chapter.  Each character's story well written and artfully interwoven to create a sometimes heartbreaking, but always engaging tale of joy, hardship and family.
0307272702|5.0|I started this diet 7 months ago and have lost 48 pounds so far. It is something that i can continue.  It is a new way of eating and doesn't feel like a diet.  I don't get hungry and all cravings are gone.
0307352153|4.0|As an introvert, I was intrigued as to what exactly this author was hoping to convey in this book, and I had several ah-hah moments throughout my first read.  The author did some interesting studies, and delves into some topics of the introvert/extrovert argument that others generally ignore or trivialize.  The idea that some of us are more sensitive at a very young age really resonated with me, particularly, and helped me understand some aspects as to why I saw things a bit differently than others, even way back then.  The book is very well written, with some personal and historical examples used, and is broken up into four main sections and 11 chapters, plus an introduction and conclusion.<br /><br />Reading the book didn't change my life--yet--but it did give me some helpful information about communication, shyness verses introversion, and cultural and historical aspects regarding introverts/extroverts.  Bottom line is: We all need to learn to play to our strengths, and stop beating ourselves up for not being more like that super outgoing star we all know.  Introversion can be a true strength, or can become one if you let it.
B00DZAWPNM|4.0|Panic! At The Disco take on a heavy banner when they proclaim themselves \\"Too Weird To Live, Too Rare To Die!\\" If you're going to call your album with that sort of proclamation, you'd best have the material to back it up. That's not the case. There's nothing wierd or rare here, just some standard issue emo-pop.<br /><br />Which is OK if you're into that sort of thing. Along with their compatriots, Fall Out Boy, Panic At The Disco weave hooks in the middle of their pop/dance aspirations. There's a few more quality on this album than the previous \\"Vices and Virtues,\\" and the recorded sound is eons beyond FoB's \\"Save Rock and Roll.\\" They love their handclaps and hey-heys, and aren't afraid to play with the auto-tune, just short of overusing the thing. You can also tell where the inspiration for the big hit, \\"Miss Jackson,\\" comes from when they ask \\"are you nasty, Miss Jackson?\\" In other words, what have PatD done for you lately?<br /><br />They know what they need to do to make up for lost ground of \\"Vices and Virtues.\\" Songs like \\"Nicotine,\\" the new wave-ish \\"Girls Girls Boys,\\" and even the Sesame Street sample on \\"Vegas Lights\\" scream, hey, we're back to our bread and butter! Hooks! Choruses! Brendon Urie singing at full-throttle! So yes, this is a decent album. The big surprise comes at the album with the affecting ballad \\"The End Of All Things.\\" Elton John may have appeared on Fall Out Boy's album, but he's making his influence here. It's a beautiful song, although the auto-tune could have been ditched.<br /><br />That's about the only \\"Weird\\" moment on \\"Too Weird Yo Live, Too Rare To Die.\\" Frankly, they only lived up to their album titles on the power pop gem \\"Pretty Odd.\\" That doesn't mean PatD aren't ready to share their pop thrills with you. Just be prepared to hear an album that's more well done than rare.

B00007LTIC|4.0|This is definitely not the last great Yes album. I am inclined to give that honor to Relayer which is better than Going for the One. Even then I'm not absolutely certain of that. &#34;Going&#34; is however pretty good, definitely better than Tormato which is not a complete disaster in itself. I would give this &#34;One&#34; 3 and a half stars rounded to 4. The Song Wondrous Stories is great and was a hit of sorts. The real masterpiece of this collection is Awaken although it can be a bit disturbing at times it may be the most cohesive of the mini-epic tracks Yes has recorded, with the usual great instrumental work by all. Most of the other tracks are solid efforts with the exception of the title track; I find it to be the most unlistenable  track that Yes ever recorded nearly to the point that it should be considered an insult to the record buying public that it was ever released.  It just doesn't work on so many levels. I find it too busy, too shrill, with too many conflicting elements. On the basis of the song Going For the One alone I would have to subtract at least half a star. I can't believe I am alone in having such a negative opinion of this song. I played it for my oldest son. At age 26, the first thing he said was &#34;I can't listen to this.&#34; If not for it I might almost give this album 4 and a half stars rounded to 5. Other Yes albums which I might consider equally good overall (I realize this may be controversial)are Drama and 90125. Although they are quite different.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|$35 Chromecast purchase cost.  $8/month Netflix subscription cost.  These trivial amounts get you a huge selection of movies, documentaries, and TV series, viewable all the time, on your TV, at your convenience.  Roku and AppleTV do more, but at a higher cost.  For $35, Chromecast is a no-brainer - you gotta have it.  The setup is something that any 8-year-old can do quickly and easily, but may be beyond the capabilities of your grandma.  Likewise the operation of the device.<br /><br />If you don't have Roku or AppleTV, get Chromecast.  If you're nervous about setup and/or operation, ask an 8-year-old to show you how to use it.  You'll thank me later.

B00962341U|5.0|I love Leona Lewis!  This has to be her best album yet.  There's only two songs that I don't care for, but still an excellent album.  Worth buying the entire CD, rather than one song at a time.

B002AISP5W|5.0|I am very happy !!!  MY FAVORITY MOVIE of all times !!  I recommend it to all!  Just the best movie!
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|While this movie was entertaining the gaping holes in logic and reality were a bit much to take.  At the climax of the movie the &#34;magicians&#34; (suddenly with unlimited resources who can be everywhere at once) somehow steal a huge safe (oddly placed in the center of a room in a warehouse behind a simple gate...?) without anyone seeing them do it.  How?  Well they put a huge floor to ceiling mirror in front of it silly!  The fact that they could never fit this mirror into the room is secondary to the fact that this mirror somehow doesn't reflect a whole crew of cops standing in front of it wondering where the safe went.  Instead, it somehow shows what the BACK of the room looks like, sans safe.  Riiiiight!<br /><br />Again, it was entertaining, but you'll need a healthy dose of the &#34;willing suspension of disbelief&#34; to get through it.

B006LSZECO|1.0|This book really doesn't warrant all the hype it's gotten.<br /><br />It's not terribly written, but it requires you to believe that everyone did and acted exactly as predicted at all times. You would have to be the most accomplished game theorist that ever existed for anything in this book to actually happen the way it is written. The &#34;twist&#34; is predictable, the people unlikable, and the ending just ran out of steam. Totally not worth the purchase.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book keeps you guessing and the &#34;Oh My Gosh!&#34; definitely came out more often than I thought it would!!! Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a book that makes you think.
B00FEC2B7E|4.0|Like Jaar's [[ASIN:B005KD5UAW Space Is Only Noise]], on Psychic he uses computer processing, and sounds which read as associated with electronic music: empty-warehouse clangs, distant echoing vocal snippets, reverberating bells, fragments of ghostly melodies, combined with sampling techniques, and a general approach to texture and building of listener anticipation that might usually be found in deep house music. Though his seemingly boundless creativity and deliberative touch easily put him in a league above most of his peers, his use of these techniques and sounds within unexpected styles of music is another quality that sets Jaar apart.<br /><br />Perhaps this is why his collaboration with Harrington works so well, and also why this album is difficult to categorize. For example, \\"Golden Arrow\\" begins subtly, with vocals and metallic percussion echoing faintly in a cavernous space. It builds gradually but is consistently fascinating, filled with small sonic details, shifting almost imperceptibly between digital and acoustic samples (too many to list here and beyond my capabilities to describe, but including cello, dialtone-like sustained organ, a grainy vinyl crackle, Jaar's own breathing?). The first third of the song reminded me a bit of something that the similarly hard-to-categorize Jacaszek (see [[ASIN:B00628DSNA Glimmer]]) might do. It doesn't really settle into a groove until six minutes in, but when it does, it's incredible, and it becomes a neon, late night driving song (see [[ASIN:B009YSLVHA Night Drive]]) accented by a deliciously watery bass and Harrington's muted guitar. Harrington's playing is a natural match for Jaar's approach to sound design, capable of expressiveness as well as rhythmic perfection.<br /><br />If I have one complaint, it's that the album feels a little emotionally cold. Nevertheless, there are hugely impressive and gratifying moments here, and Psychic feels more deliberate and less repetitive than many electronic albums in recent memory.emory.
B00F35BV64|5.0|The story line was interesting.  It definitely deviated from the timeline of the original, but &#34;time&#34; was established as relative in the first movie.  I'm definitely interested to see where the creators take the next movie.

B009NY43NY|2.0|This series had been declining for the past several books, so it's about on par with the others. I liked that it wrapped everything up, and was a satisfactory ending (although not what I would have chosen for her), but it just doesn't match the fun and plot and substance of the earlier books.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I love this game on both my phone and tablet.  It is both exciting and calming.  It is a puzzle and an action game.  It is almost impossible to play a level the same way twice, because there are so many possible to ways to achieve the goal.  So you can play your favorite levels over and over.  Anyway, I like it, so get it and enjoy.
8866137634|1.0|I'm very disappointed. I thank that had much more funcionalities. The only funcionality is some stcks. Very poor. I watched vídeo and I thank evernote erased Grid lines and aligned page, like evernote Helio.<br /><br />For my surprise, nothing!<br /><br />Last thing: the 3 months premium code is valid only for regular users. How I already am premium, it doesn't work for me...
B00FEHXISA|5.0|This is definitely a series that has maintained its entertainment factor.  The storyline was engaging.  I really enjoyed Ben Kingsley's role in the movie; it definitely makes you think.  I look forward to the next one.  Keep an eye out for extras at the end.
B00821OX98|5.0|This series is really good if your into scyfy ! I have watched all the seasons and can't wait for season 4!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Adele is so genuine and honest about her experience which makes her music so easy to listen to. Totally original.
0451419243|5.0|The author brings the reader into the life of these families.  I did not want it to end.  Can't wait for the next in the series!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolute fabulous show, can't stop watching it, started watching at the suggestion of a friend and have been hooked every since.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Doesn't disappoint! Best Iron Man of the series. Special effects are off the hook!!! Cheadle, Downey and Paltrow are a great ensemble cast.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this weather app. It is easy to use and I do not have to wait for the weather report on tv. It is very helpful &amp; I also can see what weather is at my family's homes.
B002WCLG48|5.0|The show was everything we had hoped it would be. My son and I loved. We highly recommend it to all Halo fans
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Adele is so honest about her experiences which makes her music so enjoyable to listen to. So mature and original.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I like the white color because it is easier for me to see. But this is our 5th cable in 2 months due to a new young dog we adopted who seems to like the jolt from the plugged in cable. The white color allows us to put the cable in places we can get to but she can't - hopefully.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Just downloaded on my new Kindle Fire HD Wanted anoter game since Candy Crush Saga was not available. Just learning this thing (wife) Have a Nook Color for a couple years. But think they will be gone soon
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Nothing in Hollywood comes to this very real life indie film. Phenomenal actors and story line. It is true to the book. Magnificent.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Loved this movie! Never a dull moment! A great movie to watch any time, and can't wait for the next one!
B009B8YZIK|5.0|The show was everything we had hoped it would be. My son and I loved. We highly recommend it to all Halo fans
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I actually thought it was an excellent story line and pretty well written. I would LOVE to see a junior edition with the language cleaned up. If that were available I would highly recommend it and I would finish the series. However, I will not finish the series because of the unnecessary foul language.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Since I'm an Android phone and Windows PC user, I didn't have the easy transfer between devices built in. E-mailing pictures from my home was getting tiresome, so I went looking for an alternative. Photo Transfer was the answer. Both the phone and PC apps are free and they have worked easily and quickly. I'm not one to &#34;read the manual&#34; first, but it didn't take me long to get the hang of operation. One hint, open the phone app first and then the PC app (which actually controls the transfer). I found that it can take some time before the PC app can &#34;discover&#34; the phone, but that's only a minor inconvenience requiring repeated clicks on the &#34;Discover&#34; button. Once you're connected, the transfer works pretty much like other Windows file operations. There are other features besides straight transfer, but I haven't tried them yet.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love my Facebook ( actually wife) However don't understand why it is not available on Fire HD Please let us know
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I would recommend this book. Not only is cute and funny but it's sad. I couldn't put my kindle down for the two days I had this book bought.. it grasp you in ways you never thought it would!!!
B00B89LZ4C|1.0|Like everyone else, I received the package damaged and opened. In addition to that, it was missing the blue crystal. If you are a collector, please beware.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|I give it 5 stars because I am a fan.  I miss the Stargate franchise...sure wish it could come back in even a portion of its glory.  I don't care if they get new actors, change the bad guys, whatever.  Give me back my wormhole travel and a great sci-fi tv show!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This was easy.  I'm a big Star Trek fan going back to the 60s.  This is a good second movie from the young crew.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Very Good Star Trek movie great graphics and it really gets you to thinking about how the old and new Star Trek co-inside with each other.
B000286RJI|2.0|This wasn't the full version. A lot of the more graphic parts were cut out, the best parts. Ill probably buy another from someone else.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This is one of the only sequels that actually tops the original. Absolutely stunning masterpiece! If you haven't seen it do so now!
B004A2V3K0|5.0|Where can you find a $5 download of this collection of hits? Nowhere else! You've found the best place for music and so much more.
1476727651|5.0|This is an excellent read.  While I enjoyed the Kennedy book, this was an awesome tie to his early works.  Even included his son's work.  This was just as gripping as 'The Shining'.<br /><br />Thank you, sir.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|This book was ok.  It was very interesting to read about a young woman who made a mistake and her journey to serving her time.  However, I felt Piper was not a good story writer.  She jumped from one character to the next, never developing a relationship for the reader with anyone or any particular event.  There was no climax or even a clear storyline.  It almost reads like her memory account of her experiences.  I had a hard time keeping the characters straight.  I didn't feel sorry for her once.  She made a mistake, she accepted it, she served her time, the end.  That's pretty much it.  Of course, she has more to say about it, but that's how I saw it.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Its probably not a movie I would buy, but glad I rented it though I had it figured out about 2/3 of the way into the movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The periodic account of early 1900 British life is incredible and gripping. I was a bit surprised I enjoyed the show as I typically prefer comedies, but the entire series is truly excellent.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|Great app when it works. It freezes up more than id like it too or just automatically kicks me out. Once these reaccuracies stop it'd be perfect. Hint hint.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Been playing for a couple of months now. I like the game but it really wants you to spend money to get things to move on. You can have enough money for some things as you move on to different levels but, then it's all cash from you to buy. People get sick and it takes forever to help them without money you buy, try to help them on your on by doing tasks..they die. Not sure if I will keep playing cause now all tasks are money you have to purchase..too bad..need to make the game without being to purchase dollars!!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I agreed to purchase this game, along with several others, for my grandson.  Couldn't get my Kindle back!!  He enjoys this game so much and I enjoy watching him play.  A real life saver on long car trips.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I love super hero movies, especially ones with Robert Downey Jr. in them. Did you know he can sing? The hulk is pretty good too.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I never got into the story and finally just put the book down.  I did not follow the progression. x
B0070XB0N6|5.0|Great story with many interesting characters. What kid hasn't thought that there was another family like the one's on the other side of that closet door?  Just another reason to love Neil Gaiman!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Just a great game will play every chance I get and hope that others like as well as I do
B00AEUU4LQ|4.0|I give it 4 not 5 stars only because its not quite as good as kite runner...still a great novel though
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Kind of tedious, too wordy, until you get to the good parts. The characters are fairly well developed  The history is very interesting,
B000IZ6URY|4.0|I watched this because I wanted something for light viewing. I was better than I expected. Why do I have to use so many words for this review?
B004LROUNG|3.0|The hero is an attorney, oxymoronic to say the least.  Doing good things for those least likely to receive consideration from a member of the bar in Illinois, read king Barry and his bride is most unlikely!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I read this book for a book club.  I enjoyed the parallels to to racing worl but thought there was way too much of it.  I skipped over much of that.  The rest of the story I enjoyed.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|I like this puzzle, but my 3 yr old got bored with this very fast,he still plays but not as much and l havent bought any of the others,there is only 4 puzzles and most of them is in whole pieces
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|quite a few differences from the movie! I like the book better, but still a good movie.  glad I don't have to wait to find out what happens next. no to the next in the series!
B001ECDVKE|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I'm so glad that I ordered it. Can't find it anywhere but online in my neck of the woods! Can't wait to open it and watch it this weekend!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I've seen the other iron man movies and this was just as good.<br />Would recommend renting or buying this movie.
B003Y5H54W|3.0|Bought this movie as it was on sale. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke  (Twilight). For years the villagers of Daggerhorn have maintained an uneasy truce with a werewolf, but the werewolf  changes the stakes by killing the older sister of young Valerie (played by Amanda Seyfried. Promised in marriage to one man but in love with another, Valerie is affected yet again by the creature's bloody actions. When a werewolf hunter warns that the beast takes human form by day and walks among them, panic sets in as the death toll rises, and Valerie learns she has a unique connection to the wolf that draws them together, making her both a suspect and bait. Also stars Gary Oldman, Billy Burke as Valerie's father, Shiloh Fernandez, Virginia Madsen, and Lukas Haas,
B008RA3X5E|1.0|It was a waste of money for me.  I email the customer help and was told to reset my kindle time which I did, but the ap still does not show currant display time .
B00BMR4RIG|2.0|Provides very limited weather information.  Guess I have been spoiled by Weatherbug Elite, as Weather Ex just fails to deliver.
B002QVZ71I|5.0|Historical references are great, and the steadiness of this once unsteady young boy is endearing, and his dedication to his one true love is a lesson for us all.  In this story, good guys do win!
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Was a fairly good movie.  I wouldn't recommend having young kids watch it since there are a couple bad scenes.<br />Would recommend renting or buying this movie.
0793563836|4.0|Should be required reading for all novice bass players.  This is probably the most recommended series for the new bass player. There's good reason for that recommendation. A must have.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|It's my favorite game on this device. FIVE STARS AND AWESOME I WILL NEVER STOP PLAYING IT. I SIMPLY LOVE THIS GAME AND ONCE AGAIN AWESOME.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I love technology and I expect it to evolve to make my life easier.  Chromecast seems to do the opposite.  Its cheap technology to stream only netflix, youtube Hulu, and that type of online media.  Most TVs already have that technology built in.  Other options like Ruku or Netgear makes simular devices that have more capabilities at a simular price.  So here are my top issues.<br /><br />First, I wasn't able to stream Computer content to Chromecast if the TV is connected via Ethernet.  Only works WiFi.  WiFi will automatically reduce your streaming quality.<br />Second, my TV volume didn't work through Chromecast.  I called the Google Tech and they weren't very helpful.  Maybe I got a defective unit.<br />Third, the unit cannot view all file formats.  So not all my videos were recognized from my local hard drive.  Again, the Google Tech recognize the problem and wasn't able to help me.<br /><br />Save your money.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The late 1700's was a hard time to be alive. Death lurked behind every door in the form of starvation, abuse, disease, accidents, and even madness. Life was especially difficult at Tall Oaks Manor, where a 6-year-old white girl was taken in as a slave in the kitchen house on a tobacco plantation.<br /><br />This is an intense, heartbreaking story from two slaves' points of view, and it describes in aching detail how quickly their life situation and very safety could change. The Kitchen House examines the barriers of race and social status while bringing the reader on an epoch journey of family, tragedy and unconditional love.
B00947N6UG|4.0|This is not the best or most memorable animated film, but when my kids ask to watch it for the 8th time, my stomach doesn't turn. In other words, its repeat watchability is good.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Excellent ending to an excellent series. Not flawless but perfect on its own way. Almost cried when I realised this was it, I'll never get another new WoT book.
B005PK56TA|4.0|I watched the first episode and was unsure if I would continue watching the series as the show was like anything I've ever watched. Just a little strange.  However, I decided to watch the second episode and was hooked in to watching the complete series.  The all star cast make for great performances in this suspensefull series.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|&#34;The Forgotten Garden&#34; is the second Kate Morton book I've read, and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />The story is a complexly woven connection of three story lines, initially separate, which ultimately merge and become one.<br /><br />I love the way Kate Morton spins a tale. I fall into the story, hanging on the revelations to come -- waiting for them, guessing at them, and then getting swept away on the increasing pace of the novel as it moves toward its climax, seeing where I guessed right and how the story answers the questions it has posed, everything finally falling into place but never quite as I expected -- just like with &#34;The House at Riverton&#34;, I put the book down with a deep breath of satisfaction ... and immediately wished I hadn't yet finished it, just so I could have the pleasure of reading it for the first time again.<br /><br />It's not a thriller or a mystery in the classic sense of either genre, and yet it is both -- as well as having elements of a historical novel, a romance, a psychological study, a roman a clef ...<br /><br />I loved this book.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|My son loves this game he is seven years old.Well designed game Game of the year in my son's point of view
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Actually this trilogy. Of all,the super hero it's nice for one to have an attitude and flare. Must see again
B000JQUKKU|5.0|It's A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens...need I REALLY say more??! Guess I have to...this book lives up to expectations.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Good acting and really good story that is funny and heartwarming.  The animation is vivid and detailed. Very entertaining movie.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Great love that it is Free, the HD loads a little slows but the SD TV works just fine for me.
B00DHHWY9I|4.0|In my opulance is overdone.  Still enjoyed it, but not thrilled.  Leonardo however, did an excellent job.  Was disappointed in Daisy.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Practical, humorous and simple.  A great book to prove to yourself that we really DO create our reality!  We'll work it!
0425266060|5.0|Loved the books.. similar to Fifty Shades. Erotic yet not too dirty.  Definitely five stars. Cannot wait for the next book!
B009NX1YT6|4.0|I was not around in the 50s but remember when this came out in the 70s.  Really good acting and music.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I like this app because its ad free &amp; it has excellent graphics for a kindle defiantly a recommended app.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I'm in the middle of reading this for the second time because I just had to read about Dr. Alexander's experience again. I realize there are many who have attempted to &#34;debunk&#34; his story, and I don't know that we'll ever know the real truth. Regardless, whether his experience was a hallucination or an actual visit to an afterworld doesn't matter to me, I still enjoyed the story.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|This movie was a better adaptation of the book than the original Shirley Temple version of the movie.  Highly recommend reading the book before watching it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Surprisingly witty, this show expertly captures a moment in history that often is skimmed over in text books.  Not to mention, it's very clean compared to just about any other show on TV.  Very refreshing to know there is a studio left in this world that knows how to entertain without today's almost mandatory shock value.  This, coming from a 33 year old male.
B008602KQI|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat. I watch movies mainly during fall & winter months. Enjoyed this one.
B00D5LC4GY|4.0|Changing the options of size and number of pieces can make it easy fun when small, but making it big with lots of pieces can be a little daring and frustrating.  Love the game either way!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Yet again, Khaled Hosseini hits a home run! His story-telling ability is second to none and although his subject matter is definitely not uplifting or happy in any way, his characters are super complex and developed, the way their lives intertwine is intriguing and his stories keep me riveted. Definitely worth the money!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I like this alarm for when I am going to be taking a nap, and don't intend to get a good, heavy sleep session in. I did not choose to upgrade for all the &#34;fancy&#34; clock faces and sounds. I think it is a great app for people who may be light sleepers.
B008AIGWVA|1.0|Because it does not work on a kindle and it is boring because there is nothing to  do on the game.
B001ECQ4DA|3.0|I saw the early development of the personnel and like it a little.  It was nice to see the early beginnings but not unless you love the series is this a must buy.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good, quick read. A bit predictable though and very much a &#34;chick&#34; book. Could not recommend this book for my husband!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was sooo surprised.  It was well written, and well thought-out.  Yes, it was a little explicit, but I'm an adult so I wasn't too concerned about the content.  It was a great exploration of a troubled soul.
B008ALAHA4|4.0|Why have more than one charger laying around when you can just pop this on?  I snagged this so that my newer work machine can charge on my personal laptops charger.  This way I didn't have to keep lugging my chargers back and forth.  It's great!  Plus it's a little magnet so it's easy to keep track of.  Just throw it on the fridge when you're not using it.  You get the idea.. Great convenience for $10.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|As school I do math and I run in to fractions so this app makes it easy to do the fractions
B001FB4VY4|4.0|This series keep getting better and this improved better on the first season.  My wife and I just love watching it and laughing.
B008Y212PI|4.0|My first FlipPix app and I really like it.  I enjoy the logic in completing the puzzles.  Would like to be able to get more hints on some of the harder levels.
1476715904|4.0|Great book!  I read it in one day and I've read Point of Retreat and This Girl, but you can read Slammed without needing to read the other 2.
1401938906|4.0|Pam Grout has created a safe and non-threatening way to expand (or not) your faith in something larger than yourself.
B00594XOZU|3.0|I had kik for about a year now and now that I logged out when I try to log back in it doesn't let me they should fix that like today got people to talk to.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|I did not think that this series would be able to get better but this season has my favorite episode ever by them and is a must have for lovers of this series.
B000JCSPG0|1.0|The movie stinks on a fundamental level.  It's &#34;John Carter&#34; before &#34;John Carter&#34; was even made.  What might have been an interesting sci-fi about the origins of the pyramids and civilization as a whole is a clumsly, plodding mess filled with two-dimensional characters, nonsensical plot machinations, and cheesy f/x.  It's also needlessly long.  How this spawned sequels and a tv show, I'll never understand but I guess there are a lot of people out there who eat crumbs and think it's a meal.  This movie wishes it were crumbs.  It's more like carpet sweepings and broken glass.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|I loved the plot of the movie, exotic settings, Paula Patton, Tom Cruise, and alll the actors. A movie for all.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|I'll just give a run down of the pros and cons of this movie.<br />Pros:<br />-Decent graphics and visuals.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Jaden Smith blows.<br />-Will and Jaden use the WORST British accents for the entire movie.<br />-The big bad enemy that is hunting mankind is a breed of aliens that were genetically designed to hunt humans, based solely on the ability to smell human fear hormones.<br />-No attempt is made by our super advanced star faring descendant's to just shield their smelly hormones with chemical suits.., like the ones we wear today to keep nerve agents from killing us in combat.<br />-The only weapons humans seem capable of using are future swords. Nothing logical like rifles, tanks, flamethrowers, all of which are far less advanced than space ships, and would have completely devastated the aliens.<br />-Lastly, the creators assumed that 1,000 years is long enough for Earth life to evolve into unrecognizable death machines that have evolved to slay humans, even though humans left Earth before the ridiculous hyper-evolution occurred.<br /><br />I feel bad about myself for watching this.
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows that has all the right things. The characters, settings, stories, and humor are a perfect match. If you are a fan of any of the cast I definitely recommend this show for you. Plenty of adult humor, but not too much so its over powering. The price is pretty great, and it shipped/delivered on time in perfect condition.
B00ABMZRVO|5.0|I was surprise by this film<br />Great movie and these actors were believable as characters. I definately would see this film again
B001C34HUS|2.0|Yes, it has some good comments, but most of it is just a lot of non-sense... I expected more from this book
B000VBJEEG|5.0|A great feel good movie.  Hope there's a sequel one day!  Disney never disappoints and together with Pixar make the greatest cartoons ever.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|Kin of cheesy - no pun intended.  Of course, that does not include Matthew.  He could act his way out of a tin can.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|If you liked the first movie then you are going to love this one. All original cast with a slight spin on an old foe from the series. This movie is full of ups, downs, twists, and turns that make you grip the edge of your seat the whole way through. I definitely recommend this movie for Trek fans, and or anyone who is into sci-fi movies. A great gift for any sci-fi lover. Over all an excellent addition to the Star Trek movies and I can't wait for the third! Shipped and delivered on time and in perfect condition, and was at a great price.
B00DC8O6T8|5.0|Music is great!  Love the sound and love the songs.  Really enjoy this group's music.  Will definitely buy more music by them.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|Love these guys, love all their films! Brilliant times! Definitely super gory. Don't try to eat while watching this one.
B00005JKNC|5.0|Loved this movie.  Makes you feel good.  You'll laugh, cry and sigh.  It's just a good all around movie.  Buy it!
0792164903|2.0|We get it Mr. Burton, you like the dark. It's probably a fair bet you don't pay an electric bill, but to take the first worldly-recognized American author and drag his story through the mud is tough to handle. Don't get me wrong, there were some decent parts to this movie. It is obvious there was a tiny bit of research involved. However the package as a whole creates a terrible misrepresentation of one of Washington Irving's masterpieces.<br /><br />The benefit to this movie is that it sent many people online to find a free version of the short story. Being an English teacher, it is a regular occurrence to see students eager to read the story after seeing this film. The look of disappointment is what follows next. It would seem that Burton's film crew did throw in a few odes throughout the movie. Unfortunately, he referenced the Disney version of this story, not the written version. Scenes such as the frogs burping out, \\"Ichabod\\" can be found next to Johhny Depp's cautious steps. The covered bridge also replicates the eerie echoing steps of someone walking on wooden planks. As a matter of fact, the set itself was quite admirable. The storyline even pays homage to the first settlers of the region: the Dutch.<br /><br />The chase scene at the end gives a nod to Ichabod riding the Horseman's horse backwards. All of these events can be nostalgic for those who got excited to see the Disney version every October. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning twice that the chase scene was pretty intense. The stunts looked realistic, and whoever filled in for the role of the Horseman and Ichabod were remarkable in the amount they were dragged across the dirt trail of a set. It is also a valiant performance by Christina Ricci who provides this movie with a slight pulse. Her role as Katrina was probably the least farthest character to Irving's legend. Without her, it would be difficult to watch this movie even with Johnny Depp's awkard facial expressions.<br /><br />The teaser trailerstated, \\"Close your eyes.\\" Listen to it. The alterations to this script were ungainly. While there are too many errors to mention, numerous slips stand out. As stated, Tim Burton took this tale and turned out the lights. The short story goes into extreme detail the sleepy hamlet of Tarrytown and its neighbor Sleepy Hollow aglow with an autumn show only the Catskills can perform. The opening pages give a sense of color, Indian summer, and slow relaxing days in the countryside. Even during the day time this movie is dark. And how about the obvious blunder? Instead of being a school teacher, Ichabod has been transformed into a detective of sorts (aren't there enough detective storylines already?). In the story, Ichabod is a school teacher who is interested in the writings of Cotton Mather (sorcery) and staying at attractive women's houses who have an exceding ability to cook. In the movie Ichabod is a renegade who is bent on finding who the Horseman is. It is Katrina who is actually into sorcery and witchcraft.<br /><br />Baltus van Tassel tells us early that the Hessian troop had his horse named Daredevil. In Irving's tale, Brom Bones' horse was named Daredevil. Speaking of Brom Bones, he may as well have been eliminated from the script altogether. His feelings for Katrina were quite forgettable. The fact that the storyline focuses so much on the Horseman is what ultimately drives the attention away from the original storyline. According to the story by the locals in the movie, the Hessian lost his head after Continentals struck him down with his own sword. In the story, Irving tells of a cannonball removing the Hessian's head. The Horseman appears only at the end of Irving's tale. The story had been introduced to us at the dance by Brom Bones who was looking to scare Ichabod away from Katrina. Nothing is known about how Ichabod turned out after disappearing that fateful night, but there were rumors he survived and relocated.<br /><br />While I think Burton's versionwas just enough of a bump to get people to read (or reread) Irving's tale, it created a horror story out of something that was more of a commentary on the American Revolution. Yes it was rumored that the Horseman was a Hessian, but Major Andre's tree gets no mention. It was this tree that saved the colonies from certain defeat. This tale could certainly become a great movie if filmed in the Catskills of New York. Focusing on Irving's reason to write these tales would be more enjoyable as he satirized the American Revolution. Was the Headless Horseman a symbol for someone who does not make educational decisions? It is rumored that Ichabod Crane was based on a real person of whom became furious after learning of a possible connection. These would be more enjoyable story lines instead of copious amounts of red corn syrup and witches (which sometimes led us to wonder what it had to do with the plot). This Legend would be best written for the screen for someone who isn't insisting on thrusting darkness down our throats (Have Tim Burton and Rob Zombie ever been seen in the same room? Think about it). It feels as if Washington Irving could be spotted sitting in a theater rolling his eyes, shaking his head, and muttering, \\"This is all wrong.\\" It's worth checking out once, but do yourself the favor and read the short story first.
B00AAIHAGO|5.0|Culdnt find this movie anywhere !! And when i found it on here and for only $3.99 rental i just HAD to rent it !
0984380213|4.0|This book is very detailed and thorough...it will inspire great success ! I would recommend it to any start-up in the small business sector
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|it does what it says and does it well. its compact and doesnt have a fan to be noisy like the two previous ones I had. I would recommend this if you only need to charge a phone or tablet obviously if you have something bigger you will need to look else where
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|You'll love this album if you love her songs.  One CD with all her hits - what more could you ask for.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have all sorts of things that do what this does.  Sometimes I have a laptop that I plug into my TV via an HDMI cable.  I show photos and videos via Intel WiDi and wireless DLNA depending on the laptop.  I use Netflix and Vudu on my Smart TV.  Occasionally I Youtube through my Playstation 3.  I've even been known to hook up my old Samsung Infuse 4G and play games on it via Bluetooth and a PS3 controller.<br /><br />And yet, I still got this, because it makes it so gosh darn easy to painlessly cast Hulu Plus, Netflix, Youtube, or other media content via Plex Server.  Click on the Chrome Extension, and there it is!  What could be easier?<br /><br />What this really does for you is turn all your laptops, phones, and tablets into user friendly wireless remote controls, all for the cost of a night out.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|We purchased a Chromecast to watch movies on our TV and enjoy it.  It cost us $200.00 to have it installed and had to purchase a book reader Samsung.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I could not put this book down from the moment I started reading it. As always Stephen King has out done himself.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Like teaching &#34;tolerance&#34; being kind is the pre-requisite, the minimum requirement. Actual Acceptance and generosity of heart are what are really desired. This book is big hearted and brave. An uplifting story that should be read by everyone.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|This is a really good read, but it stalled at some points and seemed to take forever for the pace to increase. I don't remember the Shining at all, so I'll have to read that next.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|As it goes he still has sale the stuff of a good writer, but the story line needs a little help.  A little flat!
B0069UP2PI|5.0|this is an excellent movie! especially if you have kids...will help train them to wash their hands often and show how easy germs spread!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|it was somewhat repetitive in the apologetics; action depictions fairly good. Seemed to offer a fairly realistic picture of the rather chaotic conditions with which our soldiers had to deal.
B00AEFXKOO|5.0|This movie I finally bought on Blu-ray. This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Loved this book! The story line is easy to follow and the book is very simply written but has a profound and deep message.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Adam Makos has written a truley moving book, retelling not just the story of one of the most notible acts of mercy and chivarly from World War II, but also the more detailed story of Franz Stigler.  Stigler not only was a GREAT pilot himself, but he interacted with others that will always rank amongst the best in history.  While not shying away from the dark issues that made NAZI Germany evil, Makos does highlight the fact that MOST of Germany's military was made up of very sane men (and women) who were fighting for nation, not for &#34;The Party.&#34;  Know only did I finish the book feeling as if I now KNEW Stigler, Brown, even Galland, I also finished with a GREAT appreciation of how close the Allies would have come to losing the war--except for the madmen at the helm of the German fight.  Great book, Mr. Makos.

B00BXHLM1K|3.0|I saw this as a live in HD presentation at the movies - and really for one of my favourite operas - it was disturbing - and not in a good way. Lucic and Damrau were excellent - not so sure about the duke (Beczala). That Vegas set was a bit too much - and Gilda's finale done from the boot of an Eldorado - give me a break! Seems people can't leave a great work alone without putting their 'mark' on it like a modern day hound.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Been listening to this all day in my car , Enjoyed it more than I have any album in a long time! , Buddy shows why he is a legend!!  Excellent album, with great collaborators , which usually leave me cold , but they are well done without the fakeness you get in a lot of  collaborations. With 21 tracks Its a great deal for sure ,I got to meet Buddy Guy at Legends in Sept of 2013 , He is as nice in person as everyone says , Gave him a copy of my new CD and my wife was knocked out when he got up and did a song at the end of the house bands set,( she's not easy to impress !!)  You wont be disappointed with this album! - Texas Bluesman Granvil Poynter
B001706I5I|5.0|This has shot up my Christmas favorite list and Jim Carrey SHOULD have won an Oscar for this. The dog was great also.
B000VHXD7O|3.0|A bit ham-fisted at times. Many of the fight/battle scenes were so unrealistic. Guy whips out a pistol, fires a shot at three enemy combatants, they all die at the same time. Come on!
B008BM9L72|5.0|Could not stop reading once I started - Loved it till the end - what about a new follow up series?
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game. but my first game it deleted but I have the game again. besides the glitch that happened wonderful game. wish I had the old game back though. I was lvl 36
B0063M22QO|3.0|Hope it gets more challenging. It has been very simple so far. Was hoping for a bit harder. Twenty word review is stupid. Five takes care of the review.
1612930425|4.0|What characterizes the author is the simplicity of her works. Nothing complicated. Simple love stories. The good thing is the deep description of the environment and customs of nineteenth century  in England, the time it  was written. The stories are entertaining and timeless. Well, all love stories are timeless.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|This is a nice and easy jigsaw puzzle app.  It keeps me entertained and busy when I want to play.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Best show on TV for the last ten years!<br />Hope this next season is as good, but I'm sure it will be!
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|I love it and that you can turn off the plane game due to no mic on the kindle fire but I'm having trouble with the game that you have to hold the blood in,it doesn't let me use more than 2 fingers,it stops registering after 2.

B008P1EWIM|4.0|EASY TO USE. EASY TO WIORK OTHER LOCATIONS EVEN IN OTHER STATES..GIVES LOTS OF INFO INCLUDING HUMIDITY AN WIND SPEED.
B004GJYROG|5.0|My grandson loves this movie. We have it on DVR at the house and I keep this copy in my office so that when the youngsters are to bored they have something to do to keep them out of trouble
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Gruesome and gory. very intriging. couldn't look away.love the books and all the movies had to try this show out. was not disappointed
B009YP9L7U|3.0|IT WAS JUST AVERAGE FOR A HARLEQUIN ROMANCE. JUST A EVERYDAY GIRLIE KIND OF THING. IT DID GET BORING DURING SOME PARTS OF IT, THEREBY MAKING IT BORING AT TIMES.  JUST ANOTHER LOVE STORY NOTHING SPECIAL.
B00EDR5N58|3.0|The artwork and the LPs themselves look great. The texture on the box and the album sleeves are a nice touch. However, one of the LPs is noticeably warped. It's enough to cause distortion which is annoying but something I could live with. But, since I have a linear tracking turntable, the stylus touches the record as it's cueing to play, which is not a good thing. I'm going to see about exchanging it in order to hopefully get one that isn't warped. I will update my review if I do.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|Great movie, kids love to dance to it, and its easier for me to watch than some of the other movies my kids seem to like.

B00D4K8SBQ|5.0|Got it to upload pictures to my Ipad while my laptop is being fixed. Worked perfect!!! I couldn't be any happier!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This was recommended by Oprah and it is everything she said it would be.  It helps me to understand my relationship better with my husband, and it teaches me my role in giving more and accepting things that probably will never change. I read it often and it mellows my thoughts and allows me more freedom with love.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It made me laugh. It made me cry.<br />Apparently it's being made into a movie which I am so excited about!
B000FC11A6|3.0|I never yet finished this book.  It is too long.  I lost interest in the story, but have an inkling to finish it just to finish it.  At times I felt disappointed in the way the storyline jumps from time to time.  I hope it works out in the end.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved book two.... seeing the freakery turm into love was awesome. My favorite book of the series. Can't wait for more!
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I do not readily hand out 5 star reviews, but &quot;Granny Smith&quot; deserves this and more. Since downloading there is a constant quarrel between my granddaughter and myself for the cellphone. There is also a likeness between Granny and my wife, although my wife does not wear glasses and granny's legs are much more pleasing to the eye. The game runs smooth and never a hang-up. As stated years ago in an advertisement, &quot;Try it, you'll like it.&quot;
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|very fascinating. A very understandable version of physiology vs trend in eating. Frightening<br />how we have been lead to believe that the food pyramid is the basis of good nutrition.
B00004THAY|5.0|BB King & Eric Clapton, what more needs to be said. It doesn't get any better than that. Do you agree?
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book has many references to what was popular during the 80's.  If you grew up with Pac Man and Atari 2600, you will know what I mean.  I had many good memories of what I grew up with.  The storyline is very good too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son loves this game.  He plays everyday.  The graphics are great and he loves that he gets to customize his own Minion.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The first reading many years ago was interesting, with the surprise ending quite a pleasant fillip.  This time the pleasure was in re-discovering the details of character and story development.  A gem.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This is one of my top favorite movies ever. Great music and a decent story line. If you haven't seen it, I recommend you do.
1400079144|4.0|Dan Brown has a tried and true method to writing his books. He never veers from the formula. And it's not a bad thing. Dan Brown writes on topics that I find interesting and I'm intrigued at how he weaves his story together
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This app is great I love collecting animals.Animals are cute and fuzzy.Right now I am on level 20.If you play this game you will love it
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|great. one of the books that you just cant put down. you will love it if you like video games and  lived and played the original video games. it is an action and adventure journey through pop culture in which you live the hero's genius struggle against the establishment.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Watch a lot of Netflix and this works a 100 times better than the built-in app on my Bravia TV. Plan on buying another one!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|THIS APP IS REALLY FUN AND YOU CAN EASILY FIND YOURSELF PLAYING IT OVER AND OVER! IT'S HARD TO STOP EVEN TO RATE THE APP!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I have bought it for my brothers, and friends. Everyone should read this book.
B0040QYROK|4.0|I believe that both versions of this film have merit, but the restored version is the best by far.<br /><br />Curiously, the extra footage of the film, which has been missing for 80 years and has been looked for far and wide, all of a sudden (and rather recently) turns up in Buenos Aries.  Probably an escaped Nazi war criminal who had a copy of the film, aging and dying, anonymously dropped it off at a library and disappeared into the mists.  I suppose he wanted to somehow give back to a world which he took so much from.<br /><br />I believe this to be Fritz Lang's masterpiece and his best film.  He came up with a story of great humanity which transcends time.  The 1984 version, missing over an hour of footage, is an interesting, if rather unsuccessful, experiment of fusing the old with the new.  Some great music is here, but most of it is average 80s fare.  And it's the loudest silent picture I've ever experienced.<br /><br />The restored version has a fine rendition of the original score and, despite the fact that the restored footage is in poor condition, it's great to see anyway (and that footage will be spruced up in time, if it hasn't been already, which means maybe we should wait until they do).<br /><br />It makes me wonder if Brigette Helm, who plays Maria and the android, ever saw the 1984 version.  She was a great actress in Germany and could have had a great career in Hollywood if she had made the journey (like Lang did).  But, she had unfortunate brushes with the law (in which Hitler seemed to always bail her out).  Those infractions, and her closeness with the Fuhrer, probably made her retire from the business in the mid 1930s and spend the rest of her rather long (and I would imagine unhappy) life in Switzerland.<br /><br />So if you had to make a choice, I would go with the restored version.  But if you have a little more cash to burn, buying both won't hurt.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|I have loved her stories since I was a young girl a d was pleased I could get them all on the kindle as I have had to par down my book colledtion.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This is a powerful and lovely story but I honestly felt the paving was just too slow. Worth the read for sure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is an awesome game. I play it almost everyday because its the game that I never get tired of
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book from the beginning.  The format of alternating chapters of the main character's life was not difficult to follow.  I also love the San Francisco setting.  I felt her pain, I smelled the roses...
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|J.J. Abrams has done the impossible with Star Trek.  He produced two Star Trek films that have been critically and commercially successful in a row.<br /><br />Unthinkable.<br /><br />What happens when a benevolent group of people are attacked without warning.  What choices do they make as a result?  Do they hold to their high ideals?  Or do they turn inward and become the bad guys?  The theme is rather clear and, like Ray Bradbury would say, talks about the real world in a way that you could get away with.  Talking about it in the realm of science fiction.<br /><br />It does have a political point of view that some won't like. But, in my view, it's a political point of view that's pretty truthful.<br /><br />An incredible movie.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Hello, I love this version of Angry Birds, but I have a problem. Today after playing the game, I forgot to close the app. When I turned my Kindle back on, about 1/4 of my screen still showed the app. I can still open other apps and programs, but I see a portion of the angry birds screen in the background. Has anyone had this issue or one similar?
B005SCSL56|3.0|I have to admit, I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with this book.<br /><br />Let's start with the positives - my 6 year old loved it.  We are heading this week to pick up the 2nd one in the series and she can't wait.  This is the first book she's ever been this passionate about.  I read it to her for about 10 minutes every night before bed, and she absolutely rushes to brush her teeth and jump into bed because she can't wait to hear the story.  She's never done that with any other book - this book will hold your child's attention with all the princesses and fairy tales mixed together.  So from that standpoint, can't recommend it enough.<br /><br />I want to point out the issues I had with it - because from a parent standpoint, I think its important to know.<br /><br />1. The Prologue is really dull.  My 6 year old was done with it after that - didn't want to read it anymore.  She quit on it for a few weeks.  The first chapter (once we got back to it) had her laughing and excited for more.  So don't judge it on the dull prologue.  The prologue is important - don't skip it - it sets up events later in the story.<br /><br />2. Some of Goldilock's language is a bit questionable for a younger reader/listener.  I would sanitize it as I read it to her.  Here are some examples:<br /><br />page 359:  \\"Get away from me, you fugitive floozy\\"<br /><br />page 357: \\"Oh shut up, you red-hooded harlot!\\"<br /><br />page 358: \\"I said silence, you basket-carrying bimbo\\"<br /><br />page 361:  \\"... you son of a witch...\\"<br /><br />It's funny hearing two fairy tale characters yelling at each other like this - but for a young reader, word choice such as \\"bimbo\\" and \\"harlot\\" may not have been quite appropriate...<br /><br />3. Along with the issues in #2, the author doesn't quite seem to know who his audience is.  Is it young readers or is it middle school readers, etc.?  The book deals with death and loneliness, and you can see the author trying to make philosophical statements about all that - but sometimes it is just a bit much.<br /><br />4. At the beginning of the book - the author makes a big deal about the non-Disney versions of some of these fairy tales - if you child is a Little Mermaid fan, you might want to sanitize the part about the Little Mermaid dying :)  Again - plays an important part later in the story, but when it comes out of left field at the beginning, it just feels like the author is trying to shock his readers - and for what?<br /><br />Anyway, I don't want to tear up the book too much - I'm excited the author wrote something that has created a love for books in my daughter.  We are definitely getting part 2, and I do highly recommend it.<br /><br />If you are reading this to a young reader, it is easy enough to sanitize as you read and avoid most of the things I've pointed out.<br /><br />There is a nice map at the beginning - we didn't discover that until half way through (in the paperback version).  The first page folds out - this was fun for my daughter to track where the characters went throughout their journey. Make sure you don't miss it!
B009UNH0EM|5.0|This cable arrived quickly and worked great. I had (stupidly) thrown my other charging cable into a stationery drawer with my paper clips. It shorted out the magnetic end. I would definitely recommend this cable. It's inexpensive and great quality.
B0054SMIH6|2.0|This movie was ok but it was not what I expected. I thought the plot was about something else- perhaps a lawyer that lost his corporate job but kept operating out of his car for the good of the community- and i was disappointed. He is just a typical lawyer that wants to wind his way through the system in order to make money. Although as the movie goes on, he does start to see some problems with this approach.
B00E8S2JZ4|3.0|(Review is for theatrical cut.  This movie was OK,  but not to the point of being good).<br /><br />13 minutes, Pete?  You want us to fork over more money for another version of the film with just 13 piddling additional minutes?<br /><br />Uh...no.  Sorry.
B00FEHXISA|3.0|The cast is fantastic, the writing is top-notch, but the plot and premises are soooo far out there it tough to enjoy at times. I don't mind a kinda wild, implausible story, but this time nothing makes any sense at all anymore. Without giving anything away, the technology displayed via the new &#34;suit&#34; is so advanced, one would imagine that with tech like that, there is absolutely no reason for anyone to be inside the suit at all. The real movie would be one of indestructible drones going around and instantly dispatching of every bad guy that ever walked the earth (in the first half-hour) and the last two hours, everyone living peacefully in a world devoid of evil megalomaniacs. But the real movie features a Tony Stark, who apparently, selectively applies his genious as the plot requires, and likewise, somehow his IQ will drop drastically to facilitate a plot device that otherwise would never come to fruition.<br /><br />Still a fun movie overall and certainly worth the price of admisson with all the flash and effects. Enjoy.
B00AF6B22E|1.0|Drug use and &#34;F&#34; bombs every few seconds made this movie disgusting.  Didn't even watch more than about 20 minutes. Waste of money and time.What a disappointment!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Everything about this movie is wonderful. I love it so much and I've watched it easily seven times since receiving it in the mail a month ago. Martin Freeman and really the whole cast is stupendous and I can't wait for the sequel. The &#34;Misty Mountains&#34; scene never fails to give me shivers.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great book that sticks to you with it's life lessons. Every 5th grade should read it, as well as every bully of any age.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Alter Bridge has done it again. Fortress is a really great album, I got my copy yesterday from Amazon. This album is very good, different sounding but you know it is Alter Bridge, from start to finish. I listened to this album straight through, it was mind blowing, however 10 out of 12 songs got five stars the other two received four stars. But all in all a really great album.
0316322407|5.0|This is an amazing story. Parts of it I found very sad and difficult to read and other parts give me some hope in the ability of good to triumph over evil!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I heard of this book, I decided it would be worth a try and I'm so glad I did! This book is amazing! And yes, what you think is going to happen might not always turn out that way. I will say though if you don't like to cry, you shouldn't read this book. This book kept me on my edge of my seat. I would suggest you be at least 12 to read this book though... I love this book and I know everyone else will as well. Thus book goes through true love, heartbreak, and reality, the cold hard reality of things. You HAVE to get this book, I love it. The only problem is I read faster than my friend and I'm dine and I NEED to tell her! :D LOL
B001HNE3NO|5.0|It was so well written, I found it hard to put down.  Always remember and pray that we don't repeat that part of history.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|A fascinating and thought-provoking read. The central point is an important one; as long as there is something worth striving for man can survive, and that it is the level of dignity preserved in the face of brutality and despair that separates the great from the masses. I like his pragmatic approach to neuroses and the assertion he makes that in spite of popular belief in the prevalence of mental health disorders, many neuroses are rooted in spiritual neglect and failure to find meaning in one's pursuits.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Interesting secret and thoughts on what one would do with the secret.  Fast read - little confusing at first with the three stories, but quickly saw threads that would begin to bring the stories together.
0316322407|5.0|I just read today that Malala Yousafzai did not win the Nobel Peace Prize.<br /><br />And what an insult to such a brave and liberating person to this day I still don't know why Barack Obama won his Peace prize he certainly has nothing to offer mankind.<br />This book is an open door to all who want to see to justice for all humans who want to gain and know knowledge.<br />These stone age terrorist need to go away.<br />Read this one.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|i love this book it was great and cool and so interesting i could not put it down i was very interested
B003G4W49C|5.0|Phenomenal book. I wish I would have read it sooner. Hopefully the movie doesn't stray too far from the book
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Great movie for adults and kids alike. Full of fun characters, good jokes and a redeeming message. Also like all good kids movies it functions on two levels so that parents are never bored!
B0040I09RM|5.0|I usually don't watch any tv series but a friend recommended s o a & i can't stop. The story line is great. The cast & crew couldn't be better. If you have the time watch 1 episode & you'll be hooked.
B009RH973I|4.0|Looks good and protects my Kindle Fire.  Lightweight and suits my needs.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable and good quality cover
B00BMR5HOO|4.0|This app is good. Very straight forward weather info. No confusing gobbledy gook like the new Weather Channel app. Just the right balance of simple graphics and essential weather info and forecast.  One suggestion would be to include a little more info in current conditions. But this app is very pleasant to use and easy on the eyes. Will be interesting to see what info it provides when active winter weather arrives.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Amazing book.. Keeps you hooked through the whole book! I couldn't put it down until I found out what happened.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Got a pretty loud hum using this mic. Not sure what it was, but ultimately, the battery was so difficult to put in and take out that I returned the mic.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|i don't realy like these short stories, a wast of money and shows no comitment  to writing a good book
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|This is one of those once in a generation kids flicks. The whole family will crack up. There is great subtle adult humor blended in, and Nicholas Cage is great as Grug.
B00AZMFJYA|1.0|No true self respecting fan of Star Trek would appreciate these rehashed, mutilated versions warped by a hopped up, deranged director such as Abrams. It is clear that the executives are finally showing their true faces & the hate they have carried against Star Trek but dared not to show until Majel was gone for fear they would be denounced for what they are & lose control of the Franchise. The only reason anyone tolerates it is because there is no other alternative Star Trek available and no one with enough power to boot them out of the franchise.<br /><br />The Roddenberry's are likely spinning in their graves over these reboot films.<br /><br />In addition to the mutilation of past storylines (because they obviously can't think of anything original) they show their hate of the franchise by destroying things held most dear such as Vulcan & the original crew just to get back at the Roddenberry's & original fans. No one who truly cares about a franchise would ever cater to those who wish to destroy the canon & slap the core fans in the face unless it was an ultimate act of animosity while holding the original fans hostage to their defecation on a beloved institution.<br /><br />If anyone would bother to rewatch the original series, they would see Kirk was a soft spoken warm, gentle character. A romantic with intense loyalty willing to take risks to save his ship. He was never the wild, out of control cowboy, he has been portrayed. Nor was Spock ever adversarial or harmful to Kirk. Nor would Scotty ever defy Kirk in such a manner. Nor McCoy such a scatterbrain.<br /><br />Sure, fans would love to see more new, original episodes of TOS & their younger years but not destroying every character & storyline as has been done. Much worse, leaving it in the hands of some hopped-up, flashlight obsessed, warped minded, microphone addicted lunatic like Abrams. They are clearly out of touch & someone needs to repair the damage.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love this buy, perfect read for the kindle. Great value and great read.  I was cramming to read it so I could go see the movie!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Know nothing about these kinds of games but can't stop playing it! Very fun making and playing with different characters.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|This is one writer who has mastered the art of telling short stories.  Each story flows.  There is no excessive description of the surroundings.  No fillers, just a story.
0385743564|5.0|Brandon Sanderson can't seem to write a bad book, my only disappointment (sort of) is there is another book in the series and I have to wait unitl nect year for it to come out.
B008GXO16C|5.0|It's great to run around the house doing chores, background music, or relaxing with a great album.<br /><br />Everything about this album is perfect and Vinyl is the perfect medium for it.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Tim Allen fans can't go wrong. But more than that, if you're a Trekkie, or have ever wanted to go to Comic Con then you are going to LOVE this story line. So much fun to watch!!!
0470876417|5.0|This book is a must for entrepreneurs. I really recommend it if you are thinking on developing a Business Project Idea.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|User friendly game with great graphics and decent storyline. Enjoyed playing, but wished it was a tad longer. Didn't have any problems with the game crashing like some other apps.
B003A9OVS0|1.0|I was just not into this one.  I love seeing bands evolve but this transformation was not at all my taste.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Story was very believeable.  Had a suprising ending.  Very emotional, typical of Sparks.  He never dissapoints me.  His books always move me emotionally.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Lots of great special effects.  Not the greatest plot ever written but still fun to watch even if you're not a fan of Tom Cruise.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I feel like I have my own horse but I wish you could ride your horse at a lower level
B000059MEL|5.0|Nothing brought a smile to my husbands face like opening this beautiful vinyl!  He's a big Daft Punk fan and this was the perfect addition to the collection.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Very similar to the movie with more detail.  A fast read and enjoyable.  I would have liked to read it prior to seeing the movie.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|This was a book selection of one of my book clubs.  Interestingly,  most people loved it,  but I really didn't.  I found the lead character, Harold Fry, to be such a milksop...so unable to make a strong decision and stick to it, that I couldn't feel very pleased about his few victories.  And on those occasions when he did make a decision and stick to it, eg. deciding to walk 500 miles in his yaught shoes  instead of a free pair of good hiking boots being offered,  it always seemed like the wrong decision.
140006922X|1.0|I am a Christian who wanted to know more Jesus Christ through this book. After I read author's note and introduction, I realized that he does not know the real Jesus Christ. Please, do not waste your time reading this fiction that the author created based on some historical knowledge and his biased imagination. I am very very sad because this book completely misrepresented Jesus Christ. To me, this is just another \\"Davin ci code\\". I really hope that people can discern the truth from many Satan's deceiving schemes.
B006ZWLXZ8|5.0|There's a warm quality to her voice that is really brought out by the vinyl medium.  This is a joy to have in the collection.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I was so excited to finally get this awesome edition of Phantom of the Opera. I have been waiting to get it for a while and your price was incredible.Thanks.
B000VZUWZW|5.0|BioChemistry student, so this is probably why I like this show so much (Despite coming up with the most brilliant jokes, chemist don't have a lot of entertainment geared for our department...).<br /><br />\\"The Big Bang Theory\\" is going to be funnier, if you have some basic high school understanding of science, but you will still LMAO and pick up a few quirks or two.<br /><br />I really like this show because it is hard to find something so original, whimsical, and witty on television (you always get these cheap laughs with that 70's show, family guy, and not really much substance. Something that is funny AND smart, is rarer than gold! like...platinum 180, the rarest stable element on earth). These series are about 20 minutes long, so it's good really for a study break (after 5 hours of sitting and staring at formulas, you need to laugh). I really recommend at least watching an episode (on hulu), just to see if you like it.<br /><br />THE BIG BANG THEORY IS BRILLIANT!
B000G6R7B8|4.0|The watch case was a little smaller than I expected it would be, but it is still a sharp looking little timepiece. in addition, the piece represents a good value given that it is an automatic. It keeps good time, and is very lightweight. The only comment I would have is that the hour and minute hands aren't as visible I would like at night,
B000000XB8|5.0|While I am not a CCR fan, my husband is.  Bought this to surprise him and he LOVES it!  He never plays it when I'm in the house, but I notice it is often left in the player.  Beyond happy with this product.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Vulnerabilities exposed and Pepper got a chance to wear the suit--------------What's Tony going to do in the next IM sequel?
B00BEIYMZ6|2.0|I watched this film before hearing any reviews so my account is entirely unbiased. I don't have much respect for comedies where humor is based on racial or stereotypical scenarios. This film is very average and doesn't add anything to the existing plethora of similar films available. It's rating here on amazon is really high. I strongly suggest you watch something more stimulating like Everything Must Go or even the slightly above average Crazy, Stupid, Love which are actually funny. I'd skip this film. Jennifer Aniston should stop doing these kind of roles because she comes across as very attention seeking and daft. The young girl in the film is beautiful but this is hardly ground breaking or anything new. From the trailer, you can get a very faithful description on where this film is going, if you still want to watch it, ok, go ahead, I warned you.
0800141849|5.0|It got here quickly and in great shape.  Thanks a bunch, Suzette!  This is exactly what I was looking for and for a fraction of the cost!
B00C061HZY|5.0|We have low key gatherings and this is the perfect soundtrack!  Absolutely love and recommend this album.  It's great to see this band evolving.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Soo I'm waiting on 0.7.6 wheres it at -_- I really wanna play online nd Yea great game tho really liked it
