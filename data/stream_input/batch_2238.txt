B00BHMF578|5.0|Great movie, I see why it won the Oscar. I would recommend it to others. The fact that it is based on true events makes it even more exciting.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Captivating and well written show. Always want to watch the next episode to see how the story is going to progress!
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Great movie and streamed well. I purchased the SD version and looks very good for not being HD. No more missing or scratched dvds.
1451638450|5.0|This is another of Ms.Bujold's excellent works I started reading and laughed out loud several times pages 168-170 and page 202 . The Ivan Xav character has learned a lot from Miles altough not as sharp as Miles.He is accidentally clever.All of the Vorkosigan series of books take you on a fabulous ride I encourage all to just try one of her books you'll be hooked. As I am waiting for the next book.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book saved me. I have watched U-tube videos, listened to experts in conferences, read, or at least started to read, a half dozen books on the subject, and finally Building Your Book for Kindle makes the process of formatting a book for Kindle so straightforward. So many authors with a good sense of HTML seem to think the rest of us can easily assimilate that knowledge and prepare a Kindle book in that way.<br /><br />Wrong, HTML is not needed. There are some tricky aspects to formatting a book for the Kindle. Getting the Table of Contents listing to link to each chapter properly and knowing where to hit the link to return to the TOC listing might be a bit confusing, but learning HTML is not the solution. Don't waste your money on those other guys unless you like to be tortured.
B009K6DKTS|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Nassim Nicholas Taleb, and in my opinion Antifragile is his best book so far. Enjoy.
B002HXR542|1.0|Like another viewer, I purchased this due to the good reviews.  I should have paid attention to the bad ones.  I wasn't expecting good acting, so no loss there.  What I was expecting was this supremely scary movie that all the good reviewers advertised.  It never came.  Fortunately this is a short movie, so I only vomited once due to the shaking of the camera (I have chronic vertigo).  Don't waste your time or money on this POS!!!

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I thought Mockingjay was a very hard book to read. It was extremely repetitious .  I loved  the first two
055357342X|5.0|George R.R. Martin, A Storm Of Swords<br /><br />(Some general comments about the series were already covered in my \\"A Game Of Thrones\\" review)<br /><br />This amazing series is getting even better.<br /><br />The couple Jon chapters at the end of A Clash of Kings were a great segue into the new focus north of the wall at the start of this book.<br /><br />I thought it was stupid to let Jaime go unofficially without a particular promise of getting Arya and Sansa back, but I admired Brienne for her skill during the escape. Jaime is not as witty as Tyrion, but I still liked his attitude and the grudging respect he developed for Brienne. Ahh, Brienne Not Wench of Tarth.<br /><br />I felt Tyrion got screwed by his father, but also that he tried too hard to joke his way out of the situation.<br /><br />I thought Olenna was brilliant - general realism, not just deconstructing Sansa's naievete, although she certainly did some of that too.<br /><br />I had previously run across a spoiler that Robb married Jeyne Westerling. I had long since realized the profound stupidity of not marrying one of Frey's daughters like planned. I wondered what had gone on. I thought this might have ruined the reveal, which I found in Chapter 14/Catelyn 2. However, I liked the details.  The 'you too' maneuvering was clever, but I didn't like the \\"two wrongs make a right\\" attitude at all. Catelyn's comments about the wolves were a brilliant way of getting across how bad of an idea it was, and she threw in an interesting bit about Frey politics. I wonder how much Edmure really screwed up, perhaps having bad luck or not really having enough information.<br /><br />I heard Tyrion was to marry Sansa, but as with the Robb/Jeyne spoiler, I still liked hearing how it came about, and it highlights how Tyrion is one of the few Lannisters with any decency.<br /><br />Wildling society does make a great contrast to the rest of Westeros. I was amused by Ygritte's multitasking in trying to bed Jon, but that also highlights how he's honorably holding to the Night's Watch act. The Jon/Ygritte chapter was amazing - not only the action (including thinking to go down on her), but also the way Jon reacted to it - slipping on the Night's Watch oath, and how he himself was the product of similar temptation. Also, while he told himself it was part of the act and eventually left her, I like it when fictional couples stop being in denial.<br /><br />Stannis seems to have the Stark problem - doing wildly impractical things in the name of honor.<br /><br />I did not expect Daenerys to go crazy on Astapor slavers, but that was great and fits her righteous fury.<br /><br />I had a spoiler of the Red Wedding. Without that, I knew Lord Frey was annoyed, and I was put off by the repeated 'heh'-ing, but I didn't expect things to go that badly.<br /><br />I didn't know whether the remnants of the Night's Watch could make a last stand against the wildlings, so I was pleasantly surprised to see them pull it off. It seems appropriate that Ygritte's last words were her \\"You know nothing, Jon Snow\\" catchphrase.<br /><br />The wedding feast scene was absolutely hilarious, and it was so refreshing to hear a knight support Tyrion's defenses. Then Joffrey was murdered. Some guests essentially gave him a Heimlich maneuver and maesters did a forensic autopsy in cutting open his throat to confirm he hadn't choked - another great bit of GRRM translating modern concepts into the medieval setting. However, I had already figured out it was tears of Lys<br /><br />The parts about Davos learning to read had been a nice slice of Westerosi life in general, but they were evidently also foreshadowing of Stannis' forces showing up to help fight wildlings. The last stands by remnants of the Watch gave Stannis time to show up, much like how Tyrion's King's Landing defenses had given Tywin time to show up against Stannis.<br /><br />I thought Stannis' arrival at the Wall and the Lord Commander election was the ending, interesting enough in and of itself, but then GRRM returns to the Tyrion and Petyr-Arya subplots. I had already been sympathizing more with Jaime for various reasons even before he helps Tyrion out. I liked Littlefinger more after hearing his side, and since his speech explained so many things, it was a great way to end.g, interesting enough in and of itself, but then GRRM returns to the Tyrion and Petyr-Arya subplots. I had already been sympathizing more with Jaime for various reasons even before he helps Tyrion out.

0439023521|4.0|This book really surprised me. I'm usually into magical realism, really just magic in general, so when a friend told me about it, I was hesitant. I mean . . . people divided into districts and fighting as tributes . . . sounds suspiciously like scifi to me. However, once I started, I couldn't put it down. I kept reading to 3, 4 in the morning. That's how good it was.<br />Most engaging was the diverse and dynamic characters. I could tell them all apart. They were all very distinct and true to their nature through out the book. Although, of course, they did change, I saw the progression. I was right there at the pivotal points of change and understood why/how the character changed. None of them overlapped, even Katniss and Gale. They both exhibited their strength in different ways.<br />Some comment the books are violent. Ah yeah. It is really violent. People killing each other . . . friends, their own teammates all so they become victorious and don't die. But, come one, people do that in war. Soldiers are going off, fighting for something they might not necessarily believe in, shooting people they don't want, doing things they probably regret when they get back home, but they do it. They do it because they don't want to die, they want to survive. In the end, their minds are just as warped as the victorious tributes in the book.<br /><br />Read again? No. Once is always good enough, unless it's Harry Potter or Twilight.<br />Recommend? Yes.<br />Read the next book? Already did.<br /><br />[...]

B006LSZECO|5.0|You are a character in this book. The narrators need your approval. A truly remarkable achievement that I couldn't put down until I finished it. Don't let the reviews by people who hated the ending deter you. While I understand why they wanted it to end differently, that wouldn't have been honest to the characters. The ending was perfect if you understand the point of the book.

0988262592|5.0|Phoenix Project tells a story about what goes on behind the scenes it IT and how a man, pressed into a role he did not want, learned to solve the myriad problems that typically plague technology management in every organization where IT has &#34;evolved&#34; into its present practice. If you have worked in IT you will recognize all the symptoms, but better, you will see how a systematic management approach (typically lacking from the skills set of technicians who have moved up to IT management) brings order into processes, establishes effective controls and monitoring, implements the human management elements that are so often ignored by people preferring to &#34;try&#34; the technical solution approach, and ties the IT priorities into business priorities. If you have been there, you will relive some painful moments. If not, you will gain an understanding ot the IT mystique and how it really can be brought into being the efficient and reliable business support and enabler your enterprise so desperately needs.

B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie hands down. It is nothing short of a masterpiece in American cinema. Martin Scorsese is a genius, and here he has made the best gangster movie ever. This 20th anniversary Blu ray edition finally gives it the treatment it deserves.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|I enjoyed the book quite a bit.  The chronology of the universe up to present era is fascinating.  Somewhat too detailed in some sections, but acceptable.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I really like this app. It is quite addicting as well, I probably spend way more time on it than I should but it's fun. Occasionally the app will force close itself for unexplained reasons but I tend to believe that it might be more due to the content people upload than the app itself. Possibly corrupted photos or files? But I'm not very computer savvy. Anyways, it's a great app an if you're on the fence about downloading it I think you should check it out.

B0055B7K7A|5.0|All the elements of a classic Pixar movie: tragedy, comedy, and a sweet, poignant story. I loved, loved, loved UP and all of its characters and can't decide on a favorite, although Dug comes to mind. The folks at Pixar know how to put together a great movie for all ages.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|This was a good read, well written, charming, but also providing a rare insight into German occupation of the Channel Islands, of which I knew nothing.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Great performances from all of the major players. A bit violent for my taste, but it was part of life as they knew it, so it wasn't gratuitous. I was particularly impressed with Guy Pearce as a corrupt, oily bureaucrat and Shia LeBoeuf as one of the brothers. I'd definitely recommend this.

B009S33I68|1.0|Buy the print edition!<br /><br />I am use to the way Kindle displays its books and I take into account its idiosyncrasies. This edition the chapters that are just one long continuos page,  with no breaks between paragraphs or page breaks. Example, the mid-break used to display the books photographs, no change, no page break. Just typed texted, photos and at the last photo the text starts on the same page as if it is explaining the picture but is in fact the continuation of the story.<br /><br />General Moore is throwing a lot of information at you and it relates the personal recollections of different participants,  without the editing that comes from a book. It is easy to get lost with who is speaking. It cheapens the story that General Moore is trying tell. So do yourself a favor, read General Moore's story but do it in a printed book edition. Something I wished I had done.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I've been a Doctor Who fan since the show first showing in England and then turned up on PBS stations in the USA.  I helped run the first authorized Dr. Who convention in the USA.  And through my bookstore, I sold thousands of Dr. Who British paperback novelizations of the series.  So I know the show pretty well.<br /><br />And, without a doubt, I thought this season was the best ever.  It concluded with the finest SF episode of all time, and yet one that was filled with true human emotions.  Topping &#34;The Marriage of River Song&#34; will be a goal for all Dr. Who adventures that follow.<br /><br />bob w.

B001LOPYHI|4.0|I can understand why this movie is considered a sci-fi cult classic. The story line is very good for its time. The way the scenes were filmed also tells about the film making. All in all it was a good movie. Liked it a lot.

0345803485|1.0|I stopped reading a few pages in. I don't know why this book is popular enough to have spawned a series. Now, Harry Potter I understand, that was interesting and well written.  This just makes me wonder what happened to standards in popular literature. It's pretty predictable, even though the author was trying hard to be shocking. Wow, really different, a rich powerful man with a kinky assortment of control issues. Also I think it is irresponsible and dangerous to encourage romanticized fantasies towards sadists. In the real world, these people often stalk and murder their partners, so to encourage anyone to do anything other than get away as quickly as possible should you meet someone like this is a terrible disservice.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Intersting story line that keeps you watching, even when the action slows down. The best Souther accents come from Southerners but the next best come from UK actors in the show. Also Maggie is very hot, she has the Mary Ann affect on men (Mary Ann from Gilligans Island).

B00A9T1HUO|4.0|I see what Josh is trying to do.  He is trying to find his space, his nitch.  His vocals are always spot on, what a voice. There are some very nice moments on this CD.  I do wish there were a few more upbeats in there but all in all this is a very pleasant and comfortable collection of songs.  Most of these songs he co wrote with someone else.  Keep plugging Josh I thing you are on the right path and when you find it it will be earth shattering to hear the right song with that God given voice. I like it, buy it, its much better than his last effort, or for me it was.
B009R8DJ72|5.0|I simply loved the book! I bought it for my kid who is 12 years old and since he loves reading Diary of a Wimpy Kid, I thought &#34;Why not give it a try?&#34; and guess what, I loved it! I can't wait to read the others before this one!

B0013527I4|5.0|Just received Season 1,2, and 3 for my bday.  I was 8 when these originally aired and loved every minute of them and the thought of being able to watch them now whenever I want(with the exception of Seasons 4 & 5)is a dream come true.  My little girl is 15months old and of the Yo Gabba Gabba! era, but is just as smitten with The Muppets which makes me very happy.  What a legacy that Jim Henson has left behind.  Love the trivia that you can turn on with the episodes!

B002ZCY7SW|5.0|We watched this series regularly, but then ended up missing the last few episodes - was very glad to have the opportunity to see it through to the end.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|I have to recommend this movie. It was so heart warming and moving. Very funny moments mixed in,even though the subject matter is so serious. The cast did a fantastic job of bringing this true story to life. I applaud the casting director for using actual handicapped actors and actresses to play the roles that they did. You just want to cheer for John Hawkes charactor. Don't miss this one and make sure the tissues are nearby.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'd heard a lot of people say how good the show was but I just didn't believe it. Once I started the first episode I was hooked. I've seen the first two seasons now. I expected to be bored with so much dialogue but I wasn't at all.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Rango poses some interesting questions that anyone no matter the age has to face:&#34;Will I be an spectator in life, or will I take charge and make things happen&#34;. Both children and adults can laugh and enjoy the hilarious events that happen to this chameleon who was looking for a change in his life.
B007M45PMU|4.0|Bought this right after I saw them on the Grammy's. I can't stop listening! Can't wait to see what their next album has in store.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This is definitely the way to publish a book on Amazon if you're doing it yourself.  The book is clear and comprehensive, and when it asks you to do something less than obvious in Word, it tells you exactly how to do that too.<br />It didn't take long to get something pretty close to okay to upload.  After that, it was a matter of testing on the simulators.<br />Perhaps a little more general background help and tips for other word processing systems might have been good.<br />In summary, if you're thinking of producing your own Kindle book, don't do it before you download this (free) booklet.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book grabs you from page one.  I loved every minute of it but I thought the last chapter kind of rushed the ending.  I guess I just really wanted it to go on!!

B00AO2ZMB6|5.0|I didn't get into The Shield until it had been off the air for a few years. Once I did, I was hooked. The show has such amazing character depth and development that you really get a clear understanding of just how complicated each character really is. The actors also do an incredible job making their characters believable.<br /><br />The show itself hits all the right notes for me: it's dark and gritty, but there's a softer side that deals with family issues as well. There's also the occasional zinger thrown in to give you a laugh. I just cannot say enough about this show. If you've ever watched any cop drama and liked it just a little, watch this show.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is the story of a young woman who has no clear direction in life. She stumbles into a job as the caregiver for a wealthy, young man who is a quadriplegic. The relationship between the two starts off on an antagonistic note, but predictably develops into a romance. The tenderness of that romance is one of the appeals of this story. You find yourself wanting these two people to find a way to make a life together. But that life requires the young man to come to terms not only with his disability but the loss of the extremely active life that he lived before his accident. It also requires an extreme amount of navigation to keep him active and involved in life to a degree that would make it life worthy living - to him. The ending is not upbeat in the traditional sense, but even those who oppose the choice made by this young man would have to recognize, even reluctantly, the feelings and care for others that motivates his decision.
B002N1RM5A|4.0|Jonas Kaufmann has taken the classical singing world by storm, and rightfully so. He's the real deal - a German tenor with a baritonal lower voice, a well-regulated middle and a ringing top voice that he produces effortlessly. Maestro Domingo could learn a thing or ten about singing from this young master!<br /><br />Here, we have Kaufmann in Schubert's wonderful song cycle. It's a young man's cycle and Kaufmann foots the bill. This is a live recording, so there are a few warts here and there, but I prefer that as the recording captures a singer actually singing and not crooning or bastardizing his technique by erroneously thinking that lieder singing demands a smaller voice than other types of singing, or that larger voices are required to slim down their voices be effective in lieder. Those ideas are both a-historic (and, therefore, ridiculous) and ludicrous (from a perspective of pure vocal technique and natural vocal endowment). None of that artificial construct is true, so it may be summarily discarded, and good on Kaufmann for his discarding of received opinion and for singing strongly and emotionally in these songs.<br /><br />I must also say that it is great to hear these songs sung in Schubert's original keys, ie: written for the range of the tenor voice. Lieder singing seems to have been taken over by baritones, who transpose M&uuml;llerin down to accommodate their inability to reach the tenor high notes. Doing so changes the character of and approach to these songs, and not for the better, both in the vocal and interpretive choices made by the singer and - most importantly - in the piano sound, which has less sparkle and added darkness when transposed a step to a third lower from Schubert's written keys to make the range baritone-friendly. I find this to be a gross misrepresentation of Schubert's intentions, and I've pretty much stopped listening to baritones in this repertoire because of the reasons I've cited.<br /><br />Kaufmann is good here, very good, yielding pride of place only to Fritz Wunderlich, whose magnificent voice has a unique appeal in this repertoire that even a Kaufmann can't match.<br /><br />Recommended.elding pride of place only to Fritz Wunderlich, whose magnificent voice has a unique appeal in this repertoire that even a Kaufmann can't match.<br /><br />Recommended.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This was a really excellent read. And unusual story, which is set in Russia, with a police detective who's made a very successful career following the communist party line. Events eventually force him to confront that controlled system in order to solve the serial murders of children. As he does so, he places his career, marriage and even his life in jeopardy. The substory about the detective and his wife supports the &#34;challenging of the status quo&#34; theme in an interesting way. I look forward to reading another of Tom Rob Smith's books set in this locale.
B013EJEWPW|5.0|I received this latest version of National Lampoon's Christmas classic in yesterday's mail and watched it last night. I will limit my review to this latest BluRay issue.<br /><br />There's really only one question to be answered: is this version any improvement on the previously issued BluRay version. In my estimation, the answer is yes. The picture on this version has a much higher grain to it than the previous version, colors are darker and better saturated while the overall picture remains sharp. This version looks more on your HDTV the way movies tend to look in theaters. And, the wobble that affected the opening credits is gone, which tells me that Warner did indeed remaster this film for this new issue.<br /><br />The sound is also excellent - very clear and crisp. Listening through the stereo set-up, the soundtrack and various sound effects came through nicely but not in an overdone way. It's true HD sound, and it shows.<br /><br />The set includes the new BluRay and a DVD of extras.I have not viewed the extras in the set, all of which look to be carry over from the previous DVD and BD issues.<br /><br />For the price being asked, this is the version to have.<br /><br />Recommended.
6303109950|5.0|I believe I've seen all the different versions of Tombstone to date (including Shoot Out at the OK Corral - all makes and the different Wyatt Earp's) and this one is the best. Kurt Russel keeps this moving from first to last. Val Kilmer's role as Doc supersedes all previous actors who've ever played it including (tear tear) Dennis Quaid.  Dana Delany is outstanding in her role as Josephine: I usually cannot tolerate the women who heartlessly cheat with married men but from the very first time they lay eyes on each other YOU feel as if it was meant to be. And what can I say about Sam Elliott? He's great in every role he plays. Fantastic cast, outstanding acting;The story is believable, interesting, and exciting. From the very beginning you are involved in all the moves so get your snacks BEFORE you start the movie: It will keep you entranced as soon as it begins and hold you until it ends.  No &#34;Popcorn Breaks&#34; here!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Everything about this package has been done right - the picture, the sound, the extras (3 discs worth of extras, to be exact!). If you're a fan, there's no reason not to buy this, especially as the 3D versions of these movies have been put on the back burner for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />I'm not so happy with the way the BDs are housed in this particular \\"book\\" format. They tend to slide back into their sleeves, and one is forced to grab the BD on the playing side to extract it from the sleeve, which always leaves a small fingerprint (ie: oil) on the disc itself.<br /><br />Now, if there was only a way to re-edit Episodes I & II to get rid of Jar Jar...
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|UPDATE 10-24-13<br />So I've had this mouse, more or less, for around nine months now. It sees daily use and still works impeccably. I don't game too often anymore, but when I do the mouse is fantastic. I bumped up my standard DPI settings from 2400, to what I used to think was an unplayable 4000. Even at those silly high settings, and with my relatively small monitor resolution (1680*1050), performance is immaculate. FPS games are a breeze, I never have to pick up my mouse, even for complete 360s. I rely mostly on slight movements and even at a ludicrous 4K DPI, the sensor is very accurate and smooth.<br /><br />Not everything is rainbows and sunshine though. As I suspected dirt and 'gunk' has a tendency to lodge itself within the lines and crevices of the mouse. I still don't like the rubber thumb rest, which is also dirt magnet. Those aren't super big issues, since both of those things are relatively easy to clean, but still something one should take into account and maybe something Anker can fix in future iterations of this product. Also, the LED for the scroll wheel died suddenly and was relatively unnoticeable, but then fast forward a couple weeks and the third DPI setting LED dies too. This doesn't affect performance in the least, but it's still pretty disappointing. I expected the lights to last much longer than that.<br /><br />From a strictly performance perspective, this mouse is unbeatable at this price point, but it has a couple quality control issues that I can't overlook and prevents it from being a perfect product. I change my rating from a 4.5 to a solid 4. STILL VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />This is my first Amazon review, so please excuse anything I may have done wrong.<br /><br />I've owned this mouse for around a month now and it is my first foray into the world of gaming peripherals; alas, it is my very first gaming mouse. I looked around for gaming mice reviews and narrowed it down between a Logitech G9x (MW3 edition, identical to the 'standard' G9x, yet inexplicably, half the price) vs Razer Deathadder, then somehow... I stumbled upon this obscure, new mouse, which at the time, only had ~30 reviews, with an almost too good to be true 5/5 for EVERY.SINGLE.REVIEW. and at a price cheaper than either of my previews options, so I threw my other options out the window and instantly ordered this one, for $40.<br /><br />SHIPPING<br />It took around a week for the mouse to get here. Shipping cost me $10. Considering where I live (will not disclose), take my word for it, the price and shipping time were fair.<br /><br />PACKAGING<br />It came in your standard boring cardboard shipping box and within that, I came across the receipt and the mouse package itself. The type of packaging was fairy typical of high-end electronics. Smooth and matte black, you know the type. The back detailed it's features in a labeled picture and, also, in bullet points, in three languages (EN/DE/JP). Top and bottom of the box were just branding. Left side, had, again, features and system requirements, while the right side had a written product description and company information in the form of a mini-bio. The front of the box has a picture of the mouse in cute little graphics with an abstract blue background and lighting shooting from it, typical gamer-style advertising that I just do not care for. The front is also a flap held by velcro in both the upper right and lower right corners. It flips open, not unlike a book, to reveal the mouse itself covered in a plastic shield. This, however; I believe was a feature designed for display purposes. Retrieval was done via opening either the bottom or top sides. All in all, the packaging was nice. I don't care either way for product packaging, it means very little to me, as all my attention belongs to the actual product alone. However, other people do seem to care about packaging and I'm trying to make this review as thorough as possible, so there you have it, that's the box, folks.<br /><br />CONTENTS<br />Inside the box came a company card, user's manual, a small, square, aluminum case for the metal weights and the mouse itself. Most apparent to me, however; was not the presence of something, but rather the lack thereof. There was no driver CD included. This good be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you view it. To me, personally, it was a very good thing, because by rule of thumb you should be downloading the latest drivers from the company website anyways (they actually tell you do that) and driver CDs usually contain older drivers and are usually filled with bloatware of some free trial of an anti-virus program or another. Now, finally, onto the mouse.<br /><br />MOUSE<br /><br />-First impressions;<br />Upon immediate inspection, I notice to good things that speak volumes of it's high quality, the braided cable and the gold plated USB connector. This is my first product with a braided cable, and I do enjoy it, but with that said; have I ever really had a problem with the standard rubber cables? Nope. And have I ever really noticed a difference between gold plated and non-gold plated USB connections in mice? Not even in the slightest. In my experience, gold plating has only proved to increase performance in audio/visual applications, everything else was otherwise the same. Gold plating and braided cables are features that mean nothing to me, but seem excite other people, and though I am indifferent to it, it is definitely worth a mention. There was also a slight problem with the braided cable, the twisty tie thing kind of frayed some threads, but it was no big deal... I ran a lighter under it, quickly, to smooth it out and there it was, the problem solved. I was quite impressed by the backlighting all the buttons and the general aesthetics of the mouse, but found it to be very light, not uncomfortably so, but very light nonetheless. I was able to fix that semi-problem, by adding the weights, which i'll have more on later.<br /><br />-Design;<br />The mouse is oddly designed; through the middle runs a rubberized matte finish, but on the sides is glossy plastic, except on the area where your thumb rests. The thumb rest is not 'rubberized' instead it actually is rubber, grilled for more 'grip,' it's comfortable. Above that, there are three thumb buttons, as opposed to the two, which are most common amongst gaming mice. Also, back on the three materials the mouse is made up of (glossy plastic, rubber and rubberized matte), I felt as if it was unnecessary, it didn't bother me much, but I couldn't help but feel as if it would've looked, and, perhaps, performed better had they stuck only with full coat of that rubberized matte stuff. The differences in materials leaves crevices at their borders and, while they're clean now, from experience, those things inevitably get fill up with dirt and grime. Alas, it's not big deal, either way, I still think the mouse looks damn good. There's a macro record button behind the scroll wheel, a macro play in front of and a on-the-fly DPI switch behind the macro record, as well as the previously mentioned thumb buttons and the standard left right and middle mouse buttons. The Anker logo, which I quite like, as well as the scroll wheel and DPI profiles are backlit, speaking of which...<br /><br />-Backlighting;<br />The 'stock' backlighting is great. It's not the dark blue that looks almost purple, it's a proper blue, nice and bright, but not overly so. It's also customizable, BUT only the Anker anchor logo, which is also the only thing covered when you're using the mouse. You can change the color to anything in rainbow, and also anything above, below and beyond it, as well as turn it off; however, the DPI lights, as well as the scroll wheel remain forever lit in blue, unable to change the color or turn it off. This isn't a big problem in the grand scheme of things, as it doesn't affect performance; however, having OCD-ish tendencies it annoys me to no end and I really can't fathom how a company can put such an awesome feature such as a fully customizable RGB backlighting, but cripple it in such a way. In the end, though, I'm fine with the stock blue backlighting as it matches my case and keyboard.<br /><br />-Buttons;<br />It has a wide assortment of buttons. The standard left, right, middle (scroll wheel) mouse buttons. A button in front of and two buttons behind the scroll wheel and the three thumb buttons. There's also a profile switch button on the bottom of the mouse, which can not be re-bound. While the scroll wheel is impeccable, made out of the perfect rubbery/grippy material, as well as being backlit and does not wiggle, I can not say the same for the rest of the mouse buttons. The left and right mouse button 'flaps' can be lifted up and down, the thumb buttons also have quite a bit of wiggle to them, not a big deal, but it does worry me a bit, my confidence would've been assured had they been more snug. They pose no immediate problem, since all the loosness/wiggling is only noticeable when done with intention to do so. Also, when I first saw the three thumb buttons, I was happy, but in practice two thumb buttons, as is common in most other gaming mice, would've probably been preferable. The front button feels too far and so does the back button, while the middle button is potrudes out more, is gripped, and is in the perfect position, it's infinitely easier to press than the other two buttons, which don't see any use from me at all. I'm not a big fan of the stock settings of the buttons that surround the scroll wheel, but that's really no big deal, considering they're easily rebound via the driver software.<br /><br />-Weight Adjustment;<br />Before I plugged in my mouse, I tried to put in the weights to make it more comfortable for myself. I unscrewed the bottom weight holder, then I put in the first couple metal pellets with no problem, but on my last one... my fingers fumbled and I dropped it. And there was my first real problem with the mouse. I didn't drop the weight and lose it no. It fell INSIDE the mouse. Bouncing up and down within the circuitry, I feared it might break before I'd ever got the chance to use it. I spent the next fifteen minutes trying to fish it out, and eventually did get it out, but it wasn't easy, no, it was frustrating. Was it user error? It definitely was, but something still has to be said about it. Why had the weight compartment been enclosed? I don't understand why there were two holes that lead straight into the guts of the mouse in the same area where you put tiny little metal weights, it is without a flaw in the design and I'd be surprised to hear that I am the only person to have ever dropped a weight there.<br /><br />-Fit;<br />Palms up, from the crease of my wrist to the tip of my middle finger measures 7 inches, my hands are average, more or less. And this mouse is bigger than I'm used to. With that said, though it might take a little getting used to, it isn't uncomfortably large. My palm rests on it comfortably and it's quite perfect for a palm grip users, a category, which I fall into. I can't comment on the claw grip since it feels uncomfortable to me, regardless.<br /><br />SOFTWARE<br />The software is all blue and looks silly, but I've seen worse, again it's no big deal, considering that it's easy to navigate and is very useful. It's good software, but I question the number of profiles available, which is 2, they certainly could've added more, like say 4 would've been a good number... They might be able to change it with future editions of the software, so we'll see.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br />As I've said, I've had a month with this mouse, so I've been able to use it to play several games. Ranging from MOBA games like League of Legends and Dota 2, to sandbox games like Sleeping Dogs and GTA IV, and FPS single player in Crysis 1 and 2 and multiplayer Planetside 2. It's performed great. The sensor is wonderful and my aim is accurate. It's taken everything I've had to throw at it with flying colors. I play at 2400 DPI, how anyone can play at 4000 and beyond is, well, beyond me... but it's nice to know that I always have the option to try it out.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great mouse. I've had some minor gripes and complaints, so it falls short of 5/5, I would rate it a 4.5/5, but there's no option for that. So, maybe it's not perfect, as other reviewers will lead you to believe, but there certainly is no better value out there price/performance wise and I definitely don't regret this purchase and you won't either. It contains the features and even the sensor of mice twice the value. It is a great first showing for Anker in the gaming peripheral market, I definitely would do business with them again.nnoys me to no end and I really can't fathom how a company can put such an awesome feature such as a fully customizable RGB backlighting, but cripple it in such a way.

B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|I didn't hold out much hope for this film, but it got to me. Enough to buy it on DVD, and enough to replace that DVD with the BD.<br /><br />I know that a lot of people don't like the motion capture technology that serves as the technical basis for this film. Yes, the people look a bit plastic when compared to actors, but they don't look that plastic when compared to animation, which is really what one should be using as a standard. Robert Zemeckis and his team have gotten better and better with this technology, and it well serves this film, even if it isn't at the advanced level Zemeckis would achieve just a few years later with the Disney/Jim Carrey &#34;A Christmas Carol.&#34;<br /><br />Definitely worth viewing every year during the holiday season. The story is unique, unpredictable and positive.<br /><br />5 stars.
B00008EPYU|5.0|I bought this for a friend and he loves it.<br />He was surprise at how gooood the quality is :)<br />I think I have created a monster :)<br />Thanks guys.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|This is a wonderful slice-of-life movie, with a very good cast and superior direction.<br /><br />The BD contains some very nice extra features as well.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, see it!
B00000EN0O|5.0|I bought this for a friend and he loves it.<br />He was amaze at how goooood the quality is.<br />Now I can't get him off my back :)<br />Thanks guys.
B006FE83U4|5.0|This movie is self-recommending, so the only question is whether or not the BD version is an improvement over the DVD version.<br /><br />The answer is &#34;yes,&#34; and resoundingly so.<br /><br />Which means that you should buy this BD.
B0019IB0II|4.0|It was a very interesting and enlightening book.  A little redundant here and there, but a great read.  Enjoyed it.
B000069KIZ|5.0|Karl B&ouml;hm recorded a lot of repertoire on DG, much of it with the Vienna Philharmonic.<br /><br />I owned this set on both LP and cassettes back in the day, and while the interpretations were good, the sound was a bit squirrelly on those formats. That issue has been rectified in this CD reissue, which now sounds just about right. In other words, it sounds to me the way the VPO sounded when I heard them at Carnegie Hall back in the day.<br /><br />B&ouml;hm's interpretations are the very model of moderation, informed and infused with a real sense of the grand tradition of German music making that he exemplified during his later career.<br /><br />Recommended - maybe not a first choice in this rep, but definitely in the top ten.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|Loooollll you just admitted to your own stupidity, I'm sure several other people are laughing with me at you. Anyway! great game.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I really liked this movie a lot. So much that I even bought this soundtrack CD to go with the BD.<br /><br />There's a nice range of Hawaiian music on this CD if you like that type of thing. I do.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00001NTXN|5.0|I give it a five star rating for my Husband.  He loves this game!  I am not the biggest fan becaus I ALWAYS loose!!!!  I beat him the first two times, then he learned how to play it lol.  Now I have no chance.  THis is a great game of stradagy.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This has long been my favorite mini-series, bar none. Everything about it is top-notch, engaging, profound and recommendable.<br /><br />The BD producers have gone the extra mile and added some interactive features and commentaries to the BD version that weren't available on the DVDs. These extra features take on even more importance now that a few more of the men portrayed in this series have passed on, including Dick Winters, who is the main character in the series.<br /><br />This is a timely and IMPORTANT series that belongs in everybody's collection.<br /><br />Highly, HIGHLY Recommended!
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|I checked all the requirements and bought the app, but I get. the same error message &quot; error retrieving app from cloud.&quot; and now I cant get a refund or some help, I have a game a bought and cant even download a pixel worth of data. can I get some help or a refund?
B0013N3DSE|5.0|I've owned this classic film on VHS, Laser Disc, DVD and now BluRay, and I can report that the BD is an improvement even over the DVD, at least visually. I do believe that more time and effort could have been spent on restoring the soundtrack, especially when Korngold's score is so magnificent.<br /><br />The extras included are also nice to have.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000JIN3J8|1.0|Didn't get past the first ten or so minutes.  No Collin Firth so what is the point of watching it.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|About halfway through this movie I realized that the entire premise for the story is a reworking of the original &#34;Aliens&#34; movie, with a few details added to make it seem different.<br /><br />Hard to imagine that all that money and time went into making the same movie all over again.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I am so glad Doctor Who is back.  I think Christopher should have gotten more then one season though.  I like him way better then Matt Smith.  Rock on Doctor Who....
0345803485|5.0|A requirement to read to find what some women are thinking and wishing.The author has given me a good insite on what those women desire.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Hands down, the dumbest script ever from middle school Earth Science class drop out Damon Lindelof.  Scientists who don't understand science, lightweight spiritualism that makes a hacky-sack playing, faux-buddhist white kids with dreadlocks sound deep, and a deep and profound inability to understand anything at all about what motivated people- it has all the earmarks of one of a Lindelof script.<br /><br />So bad it becomes funny for a little while, and then gets worse, so you can no longer enjoy it.<br /><br />Dumb.<br /><br />Dumb dumb dumb.
B0011Z77OK|5.0|An inexpensive way to get some of my favorite hits from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The included songs are awesome & the Sound quality is great.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|It is nice to see strong female characters on television talking about things that are not the male characters on the show. Totally engrossing.
B007RI56NY|4.0|I actually prefer the older Train music, but this is a great album. Some of the songs that haven't gotten a lot of airtime are fabulous. Glad I purchased.
B009VB9VKY|5.0|Great script. Great cast. Great characters who develop in believable ways. Great acting.  There was more suspense to this low key interpersonal drama than most action movies.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I am using a Kindle Fire. These puzzles are great when you are bored and don't have a wifi connection.  Having to leave off and pick it up again is difficult to figure out, but easy once done.  The selection is fair, and many to buy when you run out, but they offer some free ones also.

B00AEJM6H2|3.0|Once you get past the time limits which can be frustrating, it is great for passing time in a doctor's office, and you don't need wifi. The music can be turned off, so you won't scream after a few days of monotony.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|A time travel movie that mostly does not insult your intelligence too much.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great in this.  I do question the use of the heavy makeup.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Story that kept me reading. Amy actually reminded me of a friend's ex-wife. They say fiction is often based on something out of real life... that scares me after reading this book. It was good but the ending was somewhat lackluster and I felt an easy way out.
1250012570|5.0|I do not even know where to begin with this book. Not because it is bad. But because I love it so much that I don't know where to start. This book is the perfect romance and will leave you wanting more from all of the characters and the stories they have to tell you. This is a realistic look at the lives of teenagers and the emotions, issues, and other problems that they face at times. Eleanor is a plus size, red-haired, girl just trying to blend in with her environment and prefers to go unnoticed. Not to mention her home life is highly dysfunctional and I felt so sorry for her because of it. Then we have Park who seems like a normal teenage boy. Apathetic, emotional, and thinks life is harder than it actually is. Their lives connect when Eleanor moves to town, and they will never be the same again.<br /><br />I love books that take me back to high school. Okay, I know you must be thinking, is this girl crazy? This book will take you back to high school in the best way possible. It will bring back fears you may have had, emotions you probably dealt with, and the rush of having your first crush all over again. I could really relate with the characters in this story, and honestly I think that any teenager would be able to. I loved the development of Eleanor and Park throughout this novel. I love that you don't know everything about Park or Eleanor from the first page, but that you have to pay close attention and read further to learn all that you desire to know. I had many questions after the first few chapters, especially concerning Eleanor, but I was so glad that they unfolded the way they did.<br /><br />This book and the message behind it is beautiful, romantic, and the most powerful thing I have read in such a long time. It kind of took me back to The Perks of Being a Wallflower, but I would even venture in saying that I enjoyed this book more. The romance that Park and Eleanor shared is inspiring and completely emotional and heart-breaking at times. Sometimes while reading I saw both characters as odd or awkward, but that is the beauty of their characters. They are irrevocably flawed. Park threw out some amazing one-liners that would have had me crumbling to my knees. For example, \\"I'll cross the sky for you.\\" How romantic and yet so subtle!<br /><br />This book is a must read for everyone. Honestly if I could give this book ten pink cupcakes, there would be nothing keeping me from doing so!<br /><br />***A HUGE thank you to the publishers at St. Martin's Griffin for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review***
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This program began way back in 2008.  I never watched it at that time.  I just happened to watch a recent episode and wanted to get some background.  Amazing!  I have now caught up with Seasons 1-3 and, like a good book, I just can't put it down.  The characters are well choreographed into the story.  The plots are all based on previous happenings.  I am so glad that I stumbled upon this series as it is giving me hours of pleasurable video  experience.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Loved it has much as the 1st time I read it which was MANY yrs. ago! It proves a book never gets old if it's written well, and of course this fits that bill!
B004EI924E|5.0|This has become one of our favorites. It is played at least once a week and if there is junk on TV , a lot more .
B00BHMF578|3.0|It's an OK bit of filmmaking, but certainly not a Best Picture movie. Especially since the most compelling parts of the story were made up, not &#34;based on a true story.&#34;
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great series sorry we lost the author . He was a great treasure . This is one of the series that came out of left field for me . It is not what or the style I usually read . But that being said I enjoyed it greatly .
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This is good one that blends two different worlds together. It is funny to see Star Wars as angry birds characters
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Movie had a good cast, great comedic moments, and i loved all the classic game references. Would deff watch again.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Just a really great app. doesn't crash. really helpful and useful. I use it to see how much longer I can listen to music or play games
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It is nice to have a calculator handy when ever I need one .this one is easy to use. It's has all the bells and whistles even though I never have any need for them, it's nice to know they are there when ever I might need them  thank you
0446547573|5.0|A woman moves to South Port. With a bad unmentionable past she is not ready to get into a relationship with a man she just met. His wife recently passed away and left him alone with the supermarket and their two kids. He is now expected to raise them by himself. As Katie got more involved in their lives the more she begins to fall in love with Alex, the store owner, and his two kids. \\"When she looked up at him, it was suddenly easy for her to imagine that her fears were pointless. That he would love her no matter what she told him, and that he was the kind of man who loved her already and would love her forever\\" (Sparks113). Hence, becoming more involved, Alex becomes curious about her past and why she chose to move to North Carolina. Katie hates keeping her past, the past. She is scared that if Alex knew the real her, he would look at her differently. With a police officer following every move she takes, she becomes more and more comfortable with Alex and the kids. Katie meets a new friend from South Port, Jo. Jo, who acts as her point of reason, tells her right from wrong. As sleeping at night became easier for Kate, her protection is not. As Alex starts to trust Katie to watch the kids for a few hours in the night while he runs an errand for his friend; Katie gets a long lost visitor, who she is not too thrilled to see in South Port. While reading this intense book by Nicholas Sparks, it kept me on my toes, and made it difficult for me to put the book down. This is not just only old cliché, chick flick, love story. Out of all the many books I have read From Nicholas Sparks, t his one is beyond his better ones. Anyone who does not enjoy a great love story but also full of suspense should not read this book. But if that is you, then I highly recommend this novel to you. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Another dark and gritty movie within the Daniel Craig trilogy. There's the hint of a back story that we don't get into, but I'm sure it would make for an interesting film later. Not a huge fan of how the villain is portrayed, but I got past that on the second viewing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finished the Kindle version of the book in no time!  It really kept me interested and passed the time quickly!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|The movie addressed a core issue of being human--sexuality--in a sensitive manner. This true story is presented with great depth and emotion. The 3 key actors are terrific.<br /><br />The video did not run smoothly and had to be managed manually, which was very distracting.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|i enjoyed this movie but i didn't like seeing denzel being portrayed as a bad guy. hate seeing drunks. good ending.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Liked how the characters fit in with the historical happenings of the day.  Can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What a classy show with such outstanding actors and actress's.Had me hook first episode! Best series I have watched in quite some time.You must watch!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It's not as bad as the first one the first one was tradable you die every time and the levels are hard
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I thought the book was great. Very easy read. Felt like you were having a conversation with the man. I did not know a lot about this great war hero prior to reading the book. I got the book after hearing of his passing. I am proud to know more about him and his family and very thankful for his service to this great country.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|When I bought it, I only knew two songs. After I finished listening to the album, I loved them all.
1577311523|5.0|Very good book, enjoyed it very much, recomend it to anyone a good read check it out okay, awesome wish I would of read it sooner. Yep
B007IXWKUK|5.0|As stunning  as the first one on to the third<br />Hope it's s great but no worries I know it is
B0039UTDFG|5.0|I bought this for my brother and he loves it. Everything looks so clear on the screen, Very well narrator, everything is just good quality of work.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is simply amazing, it definitely made me cry! Not the average love story at all. You won't regret it
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The pictures that come along with the descriptions really help you create the world the author wants you to see. It is a great way to showcase history by highlighting vintage photos. I can't wait for the sequel!
B00AHXDECG|4.0|I love the way Bruno Mars sings. You can understand every word (not like so many of the singers today who seem to mumble). And his choice of songs is so unique. He is one of my favorite performers.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|a little dry in spots but otherwise a well written exciting tail/tale (I can't spell). 5 more words required, eh?
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|All my life I loved reading 18th and 19th century English novels.  This is that come to life.  Soooo fun.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|When I was in high school I read the first Planet of the Apes way back when. It was a mind blower, with an ending that transcended any of the movies made to date. This movie, however, came really close. It had a thinking plot, plausibility, and I hope a shot at giving us future stories showing the development of the apes.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|My husband asked for this series.  Our oldest son gave him the first season, which he watched while on a vacation.  This was a must have after that.  I guess I might have to watch them, too.
B005LAIGQ4|4.0|This is a good flic for the entire family. The story revolves around three whales stuck in the ice in Alaska. Their plight brings together a diverse team of rescuers who join together to overcome a series of obstacles and personal issues to make the whales rescue a success.
B00B23O96A|1.0|Sadly, very sadly, this is a new low for Mr. Clapton.<br />Whereas the horrible \\"Retail Therapy\\" album from the mid 90's had previously been his low point, this new CD effectively removes him from his legendary status and puts him in a class akin to Rod Stewarts American Songbook--the only difference is that Stewarts old age crooning actually is listenable.<br />This album is a horrible embarrassment .<br />I fear that a Christmas album or collection of children songs are inevitably next for EC as he rapidly removes himself from musical relevance.<br />What a shame...
B005LAIISA|4.0|Some critics have panned this latest Ice Age movie, but hey, it has laughs and gives loads of entertainment to the kids in your family. What more can you ask for?
B0060MYM3S|1.0|Boo, Hiss-<br /><br />I have gone through THREE sets of the standard DVD boxed set. Disc 1 and 2 all looked ok all 3 sets and played ok - maybe that is all they ever inspect! I have had problems with disc 5 in all 3 sets due to random defects that cause pixilation and hang to various degrees. First set by far the worst. Second set looked worse and played better, but still problems. Scratched and slubbed right out of the box. HBO should be ashamed and crack down on the manufacturer for such feeble quality control. Two sets some issue with disc 3 and 4, same story, defects. Defects are not repeatable between the sets so it's not the file they use to make the disc, it's pure and simple quality problem. You can see pits, slubs, scratches on the disks. Some still play but just look bad. Some look bad and have problems playing all the scenes. Third replacement set not a charm. Asking for my money back this time around. You buy a box set you want all the disks to work. Not loose in box either, just ---- right out of the factory. Patience exhausted here for now.<br /><br />When you get your set check all 5 discs immediately, don't wait to look until you get to disc 5. Most problems I saw were in Blackwater Bay and Valer Morgulis, the final two episodes on disc 5. That's a high irritation factor as those are the climactic end of season episodes!<br /><br />Amazon very good about replacement sets, but what is the point when underlying production run seems to be all bad. Just trading which scenes are damaged! Just can't watch one more replacement set to find more problems.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Not often do you run across a movie that does it all. This is not the case with the Avengers. This is a virtual smack down on all levels. A great story, a great cast, with more action than you can shake a stick at. I'm happy to own it!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is lots of fun. Kids can play it and adults. The way the game progresses is great. Thanks
B00742BVW8|5.0|Words fail me as to just how great this film is. The story is fantastic, acting great, fight scenes are the best. Story carries the whole film and though get's a bit complex keeping up with at times because of the flash backs, it all makes sense at the end. Just a beautiful love story of sacrifice and courage that everyone should see. One of the very rare films I would see more than once. Fantastic film!!!
B00APKIN1I|5.0|To provide a rock soundtrack for a rock-related documentary with a wide range of musicians with diverse musical styles can be an undertaking. Though they have a lot in common, combining forces for a singular goal was what it was all about. The documentary about the now-defunct legendary Sound City studio in Los Angeles, has Grohl \\"drawing on the talent of a number of Sound City pre-recorders from over the years; most notably Fleetwood Mac's Steve Nicks, Paul McCartney, Josh Homme and his former Nirvana band mates, Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear.\\"<br /><br />The quality of the sound produced on this recording is superb, the clarity is as pure as can be and it is a joy to listen to, but does the content match the level of output?<br /><br />Straight-up rock is what's delivered here but not as a cohesive listening experience though, \\"the ever-revolving cast of players limits any sense of identity that the album could have forged. What results is a long-player of rock standards, with a few tunes achieving honorable mention status. \\"<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is a unique project and a huge accomplishment for Grohl and his players with a few standout performances, for example, Stevie Nicks, upon hearing the slowed down, cleaner version  \\"You Can't Fix This,\\" you sense this is simply the greatest Fleetwood Mac song that never was.<br /><br />Masters Of Reality main man, Chris Goss, is another notable highlight, performing \\"Time Slowing Down\\", a breezy, melodic number, with serious weight behind it. It's full of fabulous riffs, packing quite a punch, with Brad Wilk's drumming, acting as the glue holding the whole thing nicely together.<br /><br />I read...<br />\\"Collaboration albums in the vein of Sound City, \\"Real to Reel\\" are bound to be picked apart no matter what, due to the obvious variety of musicians and styles involved. Avid fans of each associated will undoubtedly save the tracks they care about, while the general public is likely not to remember much of the release after a few years.\\" So be it. That doesn't matter in my opinion. The music for the most part is excellent.<br /><br />\\"Finding time in the schedules of the many outstanding musicians on here to write, record and tour this record is nothing short of a creative and logistical masterstroke, and consider the amount of incredible work that has gone into making this happen.\\"<br /><br />\\"Anyone who's seen the documentary was able to witness the creation of \\"Cut Me Some Slack\\", the track that joins Paul McCartney with a \\"reunited Nirvana,\\" and ends up as a perfect example of impromptu songwriting that works - probably better than it should, given the unusual collaboration.\\"<br /><br />\\"Touring keyboard player Rami Jaffee, violinist Jessy Greene and veteran session drummer Jim Keltner provide the backdrop to Grohl's vocals on the softer `If I Were Me', which hints at the more melancholy moments of the Foo's back catalogue.\\"<br /><br />It's an album stemming from a film chronicling music history, and it shows. \\"Real to Reel\\" feels like a time capsule of musical diversity, dating back to the late `60s and playing through to the present. We have everything from bluesy hard rock, to classic rock, to hardcore punk and a lot in between.<br /><br />And the artists, Robert Levon Been and Peter Hayes, both of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club fame, and Dave Grohl himself, kick off the opening track \\"Heaven and All\\", \\"Time Slowing Down,\\" a collaboration between Tim Commerford, Chris Goss, Dave Grohl and Rage Against the Machine's Brad Wilk, Rick Springfield, who belts out a powerful number in \\"The Man That Never Was,\\" Corey Taylor of Slipknot fame teams with Grohl, Rick Nielsen (Cheap Trick) and Scott Reeder on \\"From Can to Can't\\", to name just a few.<br /><br />\\"As long as the listener is not expecting an epic full of the best songs in the history of music just because of the names involved then you won't be disappointed, and all things considered this is an essential piece of listening and a milestone in the history of rock music, the like of which we are unlikely to ever see again.\\"<br /><br />I read...<br />\\"Overall, \\"Real to Reel\\" is an album that you owe it to yourself to own in some form, whether digitally, on a CD, or even on vinyl. It's a fitting tribute to an age of music that is pretty much all but dead - when artists not only recorded music but also captured the human element of production instead of editing it out later in favor of sounding \\"perfect.\\" Music is supposed to be imperfect, much like the humans that create it and \\"Real to Reel\\" manages to capture that mantra and distill it down to an hour of excellent tunes.\\"<br /><br />I agree, 100%... 5 stars easilyistening and a milestone in the history of rock music, the like of which we are unlikely to ever see again.\\"<br /><br />I read...<br />\\"Overall, \\"Real to Reel\\" is an album that you owe it to yourself to own in some form, whether digitally, on a CD, or even on vinyl.

B00BHMF578|4.0|it's a movie... It stars Ben Affleck... Seriously, how good can it be? It was entertaining, but I am seriously surprised it won awards.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have this app on all my android items. I love the back up feature. You can save a lot of notes.
B00B2DSK06|4.0|Typical Disney movie fair - good movie with heart.  It is definitely entertaining and enjoyable.  The kids like it, and so do I.
B009X01C64|5.0|I'm so glad I sucked it up and spent the extra money on this case.  It was a bit more than the other cases I found on Amazon, but this one is able to swivel so I can have it stand up in portrait or landscape mode.  Which most cases did not do.  After much use over the past month or so it's worn very well.  Very happy with my purchase!
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|It was so creative in the telling of the story. Try to get your mind around the complex story boarding process this had to require and it is overwhelming.  Wanted to watch it again and again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great for airplane time losing.  can go many hours without paying attention to the flight.  could use about 5 more colors.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|Funny! Original! Great storyline! Great acting! Just a Damn funny, well made movie! These two guys are comedic geniuses! I loved it!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|no instructions. don't know how to play it. doesn't appear to have any rhyme or reason to it.  I don't like it.
044022425X|3.0|I love reading and the characters are great, but the books are getting a bit too long for my liking.

0316077046|1.0|I didn't like the first one but was given this so thought I'd give it a try. More of the same bland.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Ordered this on my Kindle when I saw it was coming out as a movie.  Not my favorite of Nicholas Sparks' books, but very good nonetheless.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|My son down loaded this for homework and it has done very well for him. I recomend it for daily use.
0394716787|5.0|Essential for Poe fanatics. Contains all tales and poems written by author but none of his essays. Still a great bargain.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is great very fun.It gets you to manage your money and be sure your city is running thoroughly.
B008B0QH5S|3.0|If you're looking for the synth-pop beats that made you love the Pet Shop Boys, you may not care for Elysium so much.  There are at least one or two tracks that move on this otherwise ballad-filled album, but the lyrics to all of the songs are interesting enough to warrant a listen.  Pet Shop Boys show their diversity with this disc, and for any true fans, Elysium is a worthwhile investment.  Let's call it, 'An unexpected treat....\\"
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Favorite movie and best soundtrack of all time- product was perfect- listen to this cd every single day- thank tou
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This book is very interesting and informational.  I enjoyed reading what goes on behind the scenes with former and current Presidents.  I am pleased to know that in most cases they will seek out each other for the benefit of the country.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it sometimes is slow but other than that awesome! I got this app cause I love horses and I'm definitely satisfied with this app.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Plex is amazing.  The media server runs very well on my Linux server (natively as well!) and accessing it via Android or other is a breeze.  Highly recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I payed 7$ for this app a d I don't by any means regret it. Definitely 5 stars maybe even 6 if they had that many
0385349947|1.0|I received my hardback copy of this book today. This was intended as a gift for one of my employees but it is far too shoddy to give. I had thought a hardback would be a beautiful presentation gift.<br /><br />Instead, the pages are all completely out of line from one another, it looks as though child stood each one in individually. Additionally, when you look down the profile of the book, you can see the edges are completely raw and not cleanly cut. I wish I could post a picture as it looks insane.<br /><br />I have never before even noticed the production quality of a book.<br /><br />I would be embarrassed to give this book to anyone. Disgusted.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This one is definitely worth it!  Amazing story by an amazing American Hero and his German counterpart.  If you just want to read a great book, you will like this one.  If you are a history buff, you will love it!
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|This film has several dimensions/storylines, great acting, and wonderful chemistry between the actors. It starts out seemingly as a classic \\"woman behind the man\\" story with Hitchcock now turning 60 and being encouraged by the film industry to retire and go out on a high. Instead he is determined to create his greatest and most innovative film ever, and to everyone's disbelief decides to stray from suspense squarely into the horror genre. There is a creepy sub-plot about his night-time and daydreams about the real killer on which Psycho the film he decides to make was loosely based.<br /><br />Though his wife Alma has her doubts as well she is \\"all in\\" on this very risky adventure. One of the best parts of this films is Alma as the un-sung writer, director, creative and editorial direction, as well as his rock, in this film and spanning his career. Loved the complicated relationship between the couple, and that it was unclear throughout where that was going.<br /><br />Additionally the film tells a story behind the story of the making of Psycho, one of the greatest films of all time. Recommend you have it on hand because I guarantee watching Hitchcock will make you want to see Psycho all over again.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham books deliver lots of plots that teach us all a little about laws and the lawyers that know them
0062014536|4.0|I'll start by saying it didn't start great. The first few chapters moved slowly, and there was so much Lena angst over Alex and Julian that I considered putting the book down instead of slogging through the next 350 pages. Luckily, it improved.<br /><br />After the initial slow start, the story moved along briskly. I commend Oliver for writing building action that moved the story along and kept me reading. After dragging my way through another trilogy conclusion that never seemed to end (*cough*REACHED*cough*), it was nice to WANT to keep turning the pages. I also thought her pacing was great--the way the installments of the two storylines got shorter and more urgent until they finally met was perfect. This was a definite improvement over the two storylines of Pandemonium that never overlapped, so much so that I have to think she listened to some of those critiques.<br /><br />Speaking of the two storylines, I LOVED the decision to switch back and forth between Lena and Hana. Lena wavered back and forth between interesting and downright irritating, and every time I got sick of her anxiety over the boys, the chapter ended and shifted narrators. After Lena, I found Hana to be a nice change of pace, and she was refreshingly angst-free, especially given her situation. Oliver wrote the fog of her dampened emotions beautifully. In the crowd of physical, in-your-face, constantly-in-motion heroines crowding the teen fiction market, Hana stood still and made me feel her story. The climax of this storyline was perfect, in an oh-no-she-DIDN'T kind of way. I was energized after that and kept turning the pages excitedly until...<br /><br />BOOM. It just ended. Without having read many of the other reviews, my guess is this is a negative that is repeated over and over again. There are a few different plotlines going on in this book, some stories within stories, and we get an ending for maybe one or two of them. The rest is left hanging. I understand Oliver wanting to end her series on a high note, but it feels like this was a fake ending she'd send to her publisher as a joke: \\"and we'll pretend they all lived happily ever after even though this was never resolved and neither was this, and we'll just tuck this one away and hope they forget.\\" The biggest unresolved plotline I had trouble with was the obvious one...<br /><br />*SLIGHT SPOILERS* The freakin' love triangle is never resolved. Lauren Oliver, I became a fan of your writing in this series, but I can't continue being a fan if you're going to pull crap like this. I'm betting I'll get comments about this saying it *was* resolved, but I just reread the last couple pages and I still interpret those as indecision. You can't build up a love triangle and then leave it hanging under the guise of, `I'm jazzed on life and everything will work itself out.' That's a copout, and a pretty major one at that.*END SPOILERS*<br /><br />If I could, I'd probably knock this down to 3½ stars because of the lack of resolution, the recurring Lena angst, and the spoiler paragraph. As it is, I give it four stars for Hana, the pacing, and the action.es on a high note, but it feels like this was a fake ending she'd send to her publisher as a joke: \\"and we'll pretend they all lived happily ever after even though this was never resolved and neither was this, and we'll just tuck this one away and hope they forget.\\" The biggest unresolved plotline I had trouble with was the obvious one...<br /><br />*SLIGHT SPOILERS* The freakin' love triangle is never resolved.

B00A4GXJD0|4.0|I love the mix of this album. Don't love the synthesized sound of The Mirror. As always, Amazon rules in pricing for mp3 downloads.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I really enjoyed the first season. I was totally new to The Walking Dead and am glad that I started.<br />The first season is kinda short but its really worth it.<br /><br />Buy Season 1 and 2 on DVD from Amazon and catch up with instant video for season 3

0684824906|5.0|A wonderful volume providing a fascinating historical incite into Lincoln and the Congress of his times--a wonderful gift to a friend.
B001DDBCUK|4.0|This was a very fitting way to end the series.  The fashion, drama, and the addition of a new character portrayed by Jennifer Hudson was perfect for this beloved show.  Although some of the explicit sex scenes were a bit unnecessary , it was vintage Sex and The City and I did enjoy the plot and concept.  However, I think it is time for all these women to hang up their Manolo's and call it a day!
B000JMLDCS|5.0|Though written over a century ago, Chesterton's Orthodoxy is as relevant today as then. As a journalist, Chesterton addresses some of the questions disputed in his time, but ultimately responds to the great questions of all mankind. His arguments are useful for today as then.<br /><br />Chesterton's prose can be confusing and his topics dense for those who are not familiar with his writing. But I think it is a good challenge.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|When they advise you to use word 2010, they need to remind you that it cannot be the home or student word 2010.  Selling your book on kindle is a commercial endeavor and you need to translate it in commercial word.  Info is stored in your manuscript about the processes it has gone through.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|This is a wonderful album, one of only two by the incomparable Rodriguez! From the first song &#34;Climb up on my music&#34; to the final bonus track &#34;I'll Slip Away&#34; it is uplifting and brilliant music!
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I read this book, or some of it at High School over 50 years ago, but on reading it again I didn't remember much of it.  Emily Bronte is so clever in producing such different characters and types of people.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is a documentary that through the music takes me back to a time when I was young and listening to Rodriguez, and then lifts me  up by filling in in the gaps in his musical life and finishes by relaunching his career. A great singer songwriter who never made it in his home country and yet was a legend here in Australia and South Africa. A wonderful documentary - I thoroughly recommend it!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Having seen the movie I wanted to read the book to see how close the movie is to the book. So far I have been reading for some weeks as the book is so big. It will take some time to read it.  I was particularly awakened to the wonderful character of the Cardinal at the beginning of the book. Victor Hugo very cleverly exposes all of us, but particularly the priests and cardinals of the day to the desire to be well off, at the expense of helping the poor.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is a brilliant album! So many wonderful songs highlighting Sixto Rodriguez's lyrical brilliance and powerful statements, complemented by a voice that was made for storytelling. A great album!
B0028R3NCU|5.0|There are some tiny readers that are too slow to be useful, but this one passes with flying colors. I used it to test a Class 10 card and actually got a 11.2 MB/s write rate (large files). Just don't put in your keychain - it's not that tough and it may break from banging against the keys.
B00622B3MY|5.0|I got this for my great grandson who is 19 months old.  He was able to sit and watch the whole movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone who loves quality shows. The price is great and the show is fantastic.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|First movie was a bit better. Don't get me wrong - Urban does a good job and this movie is different than the first. The villian is somewhat lacking and the writing lacks some character development which are the 2 caveats. Keith Urban is standout and a natural - good actor that needs a better writer.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Don't stop reading.  I got so mad at the people in the book that I stoped reading and started a few times.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved part one, then the brave release came out and it wasn't that great. finally a good sequel has arrived! great game.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|in Anna's room cant get to last Crayon because its behind the back button.  I paid for this and it seems I have wasted my money.  very disappointed.<br />I feel silly now.  After some work i got to the crayon.  All is well now and really enjoying the game.  Next time i will be more patient.
B00BHMF578|4.0|This film is a suspenseful depiction of a &#34;subplot&#34; in the hostage situation in Iran in 1979. Very good, entertaining.
B0091WUZJE|5.0|John Wayne should have won an Oscar for this film.  He was infinitely better in it than in his Oscar winning role in True Grit.  Cinematography was great.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|The acting in this film is phenomenal -- especially Joaquin Phoenix's performance. The film's premise is intriguing, but its slow pace, puzzling nature and moodiness probably won't appeal to many viewers.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|As the pilgrimage progresses, the reader roots increasingly for this lonely lost soul searching for his own inner self while finding his way to his friend.  There are interesting twists and turns as he encounters and opens himself to folks along the way.  The author has done a masterful job of character development for both Harold and Maureen. Her background in playwriting is well used in creating the scenes and dialogue ( and lack thereof!). This book was a delightful surprise-- well worth the time!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Idk what the fuss was over this book!? If you into Rich, Beautiful,  Abusive, Womanizer, bipolar, depressant men this is the book to read...
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is just plain fun! And its free! I've played all the shark games and this one is the best by far.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love Downton Abbey.All three seasons were great.Wish it wasnt so long until the next season comes around.It didnt have to end so bad and would have ben just as good if thing were not sad
B00AMHFMIG|5.0|Not really my kind of show, but she absolutely loved it...and that's what really matters. Item arrived on time, package well and in perfect condition. Works just like a new DVD should.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|love Downton Abbey.cant wait until next season.never boring always exciting and look forward until the next time.thanks for letting it be a chioce
B005HSL626|1.0|My son loves this game, but since I installed it we have not been able to play it once! Before the game starts an ad for beintoo comes up and whether I choose yes or no it crashes. Have tried many times, even restarting device.Going to uninstall.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|pretty good movie.great acting would recommnd to some people.glad it ended the way it did.cute,funny sad all in one movie
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Written by Chris Kyle his own words, he tells about reality of war, and all the time showing how much he loves his country.  His wife also has some parts in the book, which I enjoyed.  A must read.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|love all of the Lord of the Rings movies.I could watch them every night if they were on tv.GREAT MOVIE
B008OOYALE|5.0|I'm so addictive to this app!!!!!! lovinggggggggg ittttt! it takes time but its so amazing after u get the hang of it....... its like raising a mini farm!!! something to keep your mind going. Even have the kids going crazy for it. Lol
B005OHSD3A|5.0|Helped me understand dieting quite a bit. Helped me understand dieting quite a bit. Helped me understand dieting quite a bit.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|I have about 5 of Nickelback's CD's and I like them all.  It is basically the same sound from them...but I like that sound and that is why I keep buyng.  If you don't like them...don't listen!!
B007QNRMUU|4.0|&#34;Love is a Four Letter Word&#34; is a great album. I especially love the single &#34;I Won't Give Up&#34; and &#34;93 Million Miles.&#34; Jason Mraz is such a talented artist.
B008VBYN80|4.0|It's a fun game city builder and mini fighter. Easy to use addictive. And all round a soothing experience. If you like games like this or any builder game this is a must have
B0048IMZMG|4.0|There are a bunch of recognizable singles on this album along with some other fun songs. Some songs lack the maturity I'd like to see, but it's still a fun album nonetheless.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a very different book.  I never realized that there was a language of flowers but learned there are books that define the meaning of flowers which was an entirely new concept to me.  The story was very well written and thoroughly enjoyable.  It was beautiful to see how Victoria uses flowers to overcome a painful childhood and how she transitions into adulthood.
B007ME5BUG|1.0|Probably a very good book, but impopssible to read on Kindle.  Links to chapter notes were so screwed up that, I couldn't read the book, because it kept jumping to the notes if I touched the wrong part of the screen.  Then, after it had gone to the chapter note, it would not go back to my place in the text.  It jumped back to the beginning of the chapter.<br /><br />Frustrating experience.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is one book that I won't forget.  There were so many characters that I had to keep going back to place who they were but it was worth it.  It was such a different book from those I am used to reading.  It kind of reminded me of the type of book that  readers who have read Gone with the Wind would enjoy, i.e., reading about slavery and the culture of the deep south during that period of time.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|A SIMPLE PHOTO SHOP  . . .  MAIN THING I DO ON MY PC THAT I MISSED WITH MY KINDLE  WAS PHOTO FIXING .  NOW I CAN CROP AND FRAME  AND THE PICTURES  LOOK VERY PROFESSIONAL..
B003F3PMYI|5.0|So much better than any other books on this subject.  Helpful for anyone who might enjoy finding ways to increase their level of happiness.
B006P96PAO|5.0|This is a great story! We have completed the first bible study based on this movie and getting ready to start the second. Wonderful example of Christian values and fellowship!!
B007R3AZNK|5.0|like brand new cd. works good. it could of used more bubble wrap. the case was cracked but that doesn't matter to me
B00AJER3SE|5.0|First of all, casual viewers are going to just have to ignore the negs here. That is about all you can do. This is the highest video quality you are going to see on bluray. A 36Mbps transfer of an older grainy film and damn does it look wonderful. The AWFUL red push of the old releases is gone and THANK THE HEAVENS. This film looks unbelievable and I am NOT easy to please when it comes to details and bitrates. Most blurays these days cannot seem to get past 25Mbps, many are much less, and it shows with fluctuating quality throughout the film. Not this one.<br /><br />They slightly changed the color timing to reflect a modern and SLIGHTLY cooler tone. Some people cannot seem to deal with the fact we are no longer in the 80s and no director worth their salt wants that pinkish/reddish look, that was quite common in that time, to their films now that they have a choice. Blade Runner did the same and The Final Cut looks better than it ever did, though, that release has less than HALF the bitrate of this release. Anyway, the timing does wonders for this film IMO. I have never seen this so detailed in all my life. I really think the new timing gives it a more timeless look and will be appreciated by most people. In no way will it hardly even be noticed for the vast majority. Skintones remain natural and whites are still nice and bright.<br /><br />As for the sound, it is also the most balanced and proper it has sounded in a long time. There are these few diehard weirdos who cannot seem to deal with the fact that most people don't like mono and don't want to listen to mono in film when there are effects taking place all over the soundstage that take advantage of more than one speaker. Cameron never meant for there to be a Mono track it is just that the producers would not let him have his 4 track stereo because they were cheap bastards. He even came in under budget ffs. Mono also has many other deficiencies compared to stereo with depth of the various instruments and sounds and the overall balance of the mix. You can read about that somewhere else.<br /><br />I do agree they should have at least included it but quite honestly I would not be using it anyway. They seem to have improved the stereo and multi-channel tracks. To my ears the gun sounds are fine and sound pretty damn good for an 80s film. They redid some of the effects with T2 ones to my knowledge a while back. This presentation seems more balanced than any other releases to my ears.<br /><br />For the people that are boycotting this release let them. This isn't some travesty like the original Patton release or the Predator: Ultimate Edition release which were DNR'd to within an inch of their life and looked like wax on screen. To the contrary, this is one of the best looking blurays on the market. The old Terminator release is a joke compared to this.<br /><br />Nothing to be afraid of with this one. They did just about everything right except include the old mono track. And no one but a few really care because it ain't that great to begin with. 5 stars for a great remaster and at 10 bucks at Walmart, and around that on Amazon, you really cannot go wrong. Extras are the same as the past versions to my knowledge. Peace.and the overall balance of the mix.

B008XNZMOU|5.0|i ordered this for a gift it was in good shape. i didnt see any scratches it played good. it made a great Valentines gift
B008Y73940|4.0|Mathew McConaughey nailed it. Didn't see that ending coming. More like non-fiction...with a storyline like that.  Great friday night movie.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|I enjoyed watching Shooter. The book is always more complete but the movie followed the book pretty well. I would like to see more of Bob Lee Swagger in movies.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I have adored Jensen since Dark Angel...his cute antics and mischievous quirks make him the perfect Dean! Jared is soulful and sincere as Sam. I enjoyed seeing all my favorite episodes without commercials!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first, and I was imporessed how much the book is like the movie. I loved it.
B004529NKC|5.0|This movie is made of awesome due to the skills of Adam Sevigni as Moose...yeah the lead guy was a looker but he barely did any moves. My absolute favorite is the dancing after Moose breaks that water pipe!
B007W1BLN0|5.0|It is a humbling story worth watching for 2.5 hours. A must watch for all movie lovers. It has some great performances too.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the first book! I read it in just a couple of days. But I struggled to get into this one. I had a hard time finishing it.
B002YRZ1VA|5.0|All the songs that you remember. If you can only buy one album from Chaka Khan  this is the one.
B00BHMF578|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It did show how our government is willing to throw some people under the bus. In the end a dedicated agent goes the distance to save our team.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|For a fagen record this record is looser and funkier than anything he's done in 20 years. Great songs, great guitar playing. Very enjoyable.
B0096U6TNC|5.0|Great music. Favorite tracks here are: \\"Latin Note\\", \\"Rose Rouge\\" and \\"Sure Thing\\". Infectious \\"French electronica and nu jazz\\". Only this week did I discover this great CD because I heard a short clip of the track \\"Rose Rouge\\" on the movie \\"Serendipity\\".<br />And now the same music is being used on a commercial promo for a new contemporary Shakespearean movie, \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\".<br />I liked what I saw.
B008JFC6F0|5.0|This is an excellent record, great sounds, great sounds, well recorded and played well. I like their previous record Innerspeaker just slightly more but this record is damned good.
B00BESM14U|5.0|One of the top movies of last year, no doubt. The writing, acting, and cinematography were all off the charts. I had been looking forward to seeing this film from the time I saw the first trailer, and now that I have I can say proudly - it did not disappoint. Everything about this film was perfect.
B00006AW2S|5.0|Simply one of the best bluesy stones records ever made. Contain some of the big early hits, a joy to listen too.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show never fails to surprise and impress me. The story line is far-fetched, but the writers and actors make it totally believable.<br /><br />My husband, after refusing to watch the first 2 seasons with me (he thought a tv series about zombies would be stupid), has become a huge fan! We have watched the first two seasons (me for a second time) and are loving the third season!
B007W1BLN0|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from the movie.  I have seen it pop up in Netflix and other queues for a couple years, so I finally decided to watch, and I enjoyed it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Sic ae latinus gobbledygook. I don't feel like writing a real review. Why can't I just click on stars? huh?
B004Q3SGWG|3.0|An interesting story, but, even at only 1.5 hours long, seemed to drag on at times.  The kids liked it, though!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow!!! There aren't words to describe this book. But you have to read it make it point to read this book. It's full of sorrow but also full of love. I really feel in love with Holder for all his passion, love and patient with Sky..  Wow!!  I love it!! Love it!!
B000SW16M6|5.0|This movie is as good now as when it was first released.  Does not age as bad as I did :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is like taking care of a real horse and i have always wanted<br />a horse so this made my life better. Many other people may think<br />This game is stupid but i got an update on this game without paying<br />and got 1,000 gems and 1,000,000 coins. The people that make<br />this game think that we deserve more then what we get so<br />They gave it to us and that's how I know these people aren't<br />Greedy they understand how it would feel if they were a<br />Costumer and they got a game and it was a rip off. So they<br />think they shouldn't do it to us and that is good it's<br />Great actually. You should be thankful and not think<br />Wow what a rip off
B0063IH60K|3.0|I just downloaded this, and so far, it is way too easy.  I expected it to be a bit of a challenge, but I won the first two games in less than 10 minutes.  I am hoping it gets a bit more challenging.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this app a lot, it has all your favorite ponies and their jobs. Cool 2D animation. Has gotten annoying with the ads and notifications saying &quot;Twilight Sparkle is ready to play!&quot; On it, but otherwise a full five stars! I highly recommend it for kids 5-11 It's great you'll love it!
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Maybe I just don't understand this game, but I don't see the point of any of it.  Build a cart that will go down a hill and up another? I was bored after just a few minutes, and being technologically unadvanced, haven't figured out how to delete it yet.  I'm glad it was free.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a really great time eater. I love the amount and variety of games even though somebody them seem near to impossible at times! A solid game though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game has great graphics.  My daughter loves it. Horses are awesome creatures. Love this game!!!!I definitely recommend this app
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|With such a build up for this season, I expected more.  The acting as always was superb but I felt the writing wasn't up to Fellowes previous standards.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and can't wait for next season!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I love the Game of Thrones!  Best series I have ever watched.  It has all the stuff guys like in shows, action, adventure, character development, war, monsters, dragons, and oh yeah nudity.
0307266303|1.0|I don't like the auther using the F word throughout the book.<br />It is not necessary.  I feel embarrassed if my kids read the<br />book.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My whole family enjoyed this movie. It was great to see my husband genuinely interested in a kids movie and my son laughed the whole way through the movie.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Reminds me of all the times I faked being sick to stay home.  Great movie to watch with your kids!
030758836X|3.0|I didn't care for it at first then I did get into it some it's really twisted and screwed up!
0385344228|4.0|Willaim Landay's \\"Defending Jacob\\" is a legal thriller and novel of psychological suspense that raises more questions than it answers.  Fifty-one year old Andrew Barber, a Massachusetts district attorney, is horrified when his fourteen-year-old son, Jacob, is accused of killing a classmate and leaving his body in a wooded area of a local park.  Andy refuses to entertain the idea that Jake is capable of such malevolence.  He is determined to do whatever he can to protect his only child.  Laurie, Andy's devoted wife, is distraught and overwhelmed by the tragedy that has befallen their family.<br /><br />This is an intense and suspenseful page-turner in which we observe the proceedings from the perspective of Andy Barber, the first person narrator.  He has a great deal to lose--Jake's freedom as well as his own career, marriage, and reputation are all at stake. Can Jonathan Klein, Jacob's capable defense attorney, somehow turn things around?  As we learn more about the suspect's complex personality, Andy's shadowy past, and Jake and Ben's hostility towards one another, we, along with the jury, weigh the evidence and draw our own conclusions.<br /><br />The author, a former district attorney, presents gripping testimony and skillfully depicts the courtroom clashes between Klein and prosecutor Neil Logiudice. In addition, Landay poses some thought-provoking questions:  Can an inclination towards violence be inherited?  How much responsibility do parents bear for their children's misdeeds?  In what ways do catastrophic events erode a previously happy marriage?<br /><br />This compelling story grips us with its intriguing characters, provocative themes, and crisply written dialogue.  Although it is weakened somewhat by its excessive length, profanity-laden exchanges during a grand jury proceeding, and over-the-top finale, \\"Defending Jacob\\" will likely appeal to fans of John Grisham and Scott Turow.  Readers will be mesmerized by Landay's depiction of a sensational murder trial and stunned by its shocking aftermath.rial and stunned by its shocking aftermath.
B005FMZX9Q|3.0|If you are paying a hundred bucks for a watch, by all means you´re gonna get that value. There are no arbitrages here. Paying the full price for this watch would be obscene. The strap wears quickly, and the movement is not precise. Looks nice from the distance though.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Very entertaining and fun, but with some violent intensity and stern language for the under age 5 range. I would recommend
0316069434|2.0|I was very disappointed in this, Michael's latest. ..after waiting for it for a long time.<br />Found the storyline boring, never really connected with the character Annecke or much cared whether he solved the case or not. There was no urgency or reason to get excited about the denouement.<br />I haven't finished the book yet, and I may not, but near the end, the character names are confusing and it's hard to remember who is whom. Also the ending seems rushed and like an afterthought.<br />In future, would like to hear more about his relationship with Maddie and his role as her dad.<br />I adore Connelly but this one was a \\"miss\\" IMO.
B00787IR2Q|4.0|Had fun watching this again with my kids. Best for the over age 5 crew I think, but my younger guys liked it. There were a couple words that I didn't,t care for , but would recommend
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy playing when waiting for an appointment or cooking dinner.  Seems to play out pretty quick and keeps the brain moving.
B008220BLG|5.0|I read Isaac's book quite a while ago and really loved it.<br />But when I first heard they're making a movie out of it, I wasn't really sure what to think.<br />What if they would make the same dumb mistake they've already made with the \\"Twilight series\\"?<br />Thank god, my doubts turned out to have been absolutely unnecessary. I fell in love all over again with \\"R\\" and the whole story.<br />I think, it's one of the best paranormal fiction adaptions ever and exactly how \\"Twilight\\" could (should) have been! If you're looking for an incredible and very unique Romance, you should'nt miss \\"Warm Bodies\\"! :)
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have finished almost all of them and will go back and play them again and again.  They are very addictive
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I like to draw even though I am not that talented at it, and I thought when searching for a new game, this sounded like fun.  But I felt for a new player, it left lots of unanswered questions.  More imformation on the game itself may be needed for new gamies.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I like all the myths and the the action if I were you reading this post read this book because I read the whole series and it is awesome
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Skyfall is by far, Daniel Craig's best Bond film. Not so much because of Craig, but because Javier Bardem makes such a good villain. Definitely wish I had seen this in theaters instead.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It made my whole phone slow to the point of being unusable, and killed my battery life.  Only when I shut off notifications did it speed up a bit.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|The battery is dead, two days after receiving the watch.........at least I hope its just the battery. I am taking it to jeweler to deter why its not working.
0425263908|5.0|Never knew what I could ready after Fifty Shades of Grey.  Now I know and I love this book.  I loved Fifty Shades and now I love love this book.  Great book to continue my journey.  I love to read now.  Haha!
B001OKCT2M|5.0|a few &#34;tic tocs&#34; ago i had the great pleasure in watching this goody movie that filled me with joy joy feelings. -be well<br /><br />ok, but really this movie is a good old fashion action movie with guns and explosions, and god damnit i love it.<br /><br />also if you didnt get the references,,  watch the movie...
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I continue to come back to this favorite movie year after year because the love story is powerful. It includes persevering love in the face of all opposition; overcoming tragedy by the power of love and faith.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|looked interesting, heard nothing but bad things about it..<br /><br />i rented it and thought it was pretty fun to watch.. and thats what a movie is all about..
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love that amazon offers great perks for having amazon prime! So easy to use under my \\"watchlist\\" and which episode I left off at.
0670023329|5.0|You cant not 5 star this.... its an amazing true story and will make you feel like s*** for ever complaining about anything...
B001EN71DQ|5.0|but now of course i need to do a trade in and get a whole blue ray set of all 6--- but now there will be a 7th, so i may as well wait !
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Very enlightening book . A must read for all couples or singles . Make life much easier to love.<br />Just makes \\"good\\" sense !
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I found it very interesting however at times it bogged down with all the &#34;Seal&#34; persona.  I know they are highly trained and very good at what they do.  I just don't know if going into bars and fighting whoever is what they were trained for.  The &#34;in-country&#34; stories were very exciting.  I enjoyed the book a lot.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The story is a sweet one with the message of gaining self respect by courageously making a change. Katie leaves a dysfunctional, perhaps dangerous situation to begin a new chapter in her life. Although not completely realistic the story does address the challenges we face when trying to make changes.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|My ten year old  grandson liked it, but I on the other hand I felt it fell short for a Disney cartoon.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the amazing bravery of Katie and how she fell in love with Alex. A lot from the story resembles to many women that are hesitant to leave abusive husbands.
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|Rabbit Proof Fence is a heartbreaking story based upon a govt policy that lasted for generations (until 1970?) and forced families to give up their children. This powerful story reveals a native people that deserve all of our collective respect for the sheer determination to stay a free people.A must watch film.
B009G41CG2|5.0|Just what I was looking for... Something to challenge me... Many different puzzles.. Would recommend this to everyone... Enjoy yourself..
B003TTKB5I|5.0|Love it! Can't stop watching at one episode! Moving on to season 2! Would recommend to anyone who likes medical dramas
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Very informative. Great read. Would recommend this book to all who strive to learn more about the presidency, and what happens after you leave office.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Great beginning to a great series.  I'm really looking forward to seeing other seasons.  It gets better the more I watch.
B007SGM084|5.0|I'm not much for dramatic romances, but I fell in love with this trilogy. It keeps you wanting more and you're not disappointed.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book has you hooked from the beginning. I didn't want to put it down.. It's more than just a crime story.  The characters are constantly growing and changing- you won't get bored. Highly recommended.
B009H442DG|5.0|What could be better than these two singing together - loved the duets and was a nice holiday addition.  Enjoyed!
B001F4UHFI|4.0|One of his best movies. I'm not a large fan of him period. But my boyfriend reccomended it and it really was a good movie.
B008OOYALE|4.0|think this is a great game. would recommend to anyone. have a few games from same company like them all.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love all the extras I love that you can share and and email for facebook I love sharing a verse with people.. it is so wonderful so that I don't have to type it out it's easier just with a couple clicks to share God's words with others!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Episode after episode I'm transformed to another time!  Having the ability to watch each episode from instant video eliminates the wait week to week
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really really like I mean love it. so I almost come pleat it all but not all. My friend Sara likes it to
B006LSZECO|3.0|I read this book because everyone I knew told me &#34;I have to read it&#34;. I was so ready to love this book but I found it such a let down. The book is awesome until the plot unraveled and then just became disappointing. The concept was interesting and there was so much development in the first half that just gets tossed towards the end. The end is also a huge let down.
B008602KQI|5.0|After reading the book I wanted to see the movie. From the opening scene to the last, I was riveted to my screen. One of the best movies I have seen in quite awhile.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Unrealistic story with unlikable characters. Story drags on and forcefully tries to throw off the reader.<br />May keep your interest but nothing I would recommend.

B0042EJD8A|1.0|Nothing like a good ol' Leftist propaganda film featuring outrageous, junk-science based, anti-capitalist claptrap. This movie, with its predictable hysteria, has attracted viewers like flies to a cow flop. One would think that with everyone saying they want alternatives to foreign oil; the uber-left celebrities/Hollywood/academia/media would love fracking. For those willing to see reality, the process takes place thousands of feet underground, separated from underground water sources by a mile or more of rock. In the last 60 years or so, a million wells or more have been fracked, with no documented instances of groundwater contamination. The risks are small and the rewards immense. Fracking lowered the price of natural gas so much that Americans heat our homes for less, and manufacturing that once left America has returned. For those concerned about global warming, burning gas instead of oil or coal reduces CO2 emissions. Furthermore, gas got into plumbing long before fracking came. That's why it's called \\"natural gas\\".  Some gets into well water. Environmental officials investigated the flames shown in \\"Gasland\\" and concluded that the pollution had nothing to do with fracking. Josh Fox, like so many other activists, doesn't like to answer questions that don't fit his/their narrative.  Some just won't be happy unless we go back to what we did before industrialization: burn lots of trees, ride around on horses, and die young.

B007REV4T8|4.0|The title of this post sums it up - finally saw it on dvd 2 days ago.  A good Bond movie - I enjoyed it - but I was a little disappointed.  I think part of it is how much it has been talked up, people even saying it should have been nominated for best pic.  Well, it isn't THAT good.  Here's the whole thing - the opening 15 minutes were great.  Then a lull, then kind of slow, then when Bardem shows up, the movie gets really really good.<br /><br />So the thing is...you have the opening, then kind of slow and boring until Bardem shows up, and then the last hour is really good - Judie Dench is great in this.  This movie could have been shorter.  I have seen it one time, maybe I will feel differently after another view.  But besides the opening, the movie is kind of boring until Bardem shows up.<br /><br />Confusing too - I don't think the storytelling is good at all in the first hour and 20 minutes - could have been a clearer story - I still don't know what Bond was doing when he jumped on the elevator and went up there and he let that guy shoot the other guy.  Didn't understand that.  I mean I think that was the guy on the train at the beginning, but how did Bond find him and I don't have a clue who he shot.  That part of the movie, besides just that scene, was muddled and unclear.  Didn't like that.  But I didn't like the confusing first hour and a half.<br /><br />Daniel Craig was good, and as you can tell, I really liked Bardem in it.  Unique Bond villain, yet classic.  I liked this movie, but I think the hype hurt it in my eyes because I expected more.<br /><br />To help you and know where I am coming from in case you are a Bond fan and you want to know my tastes - I have 4 fave Bond movies - For Your Eyes Only is my favorite, followed closely by Spy Who Loved Me and Goldfinger, and then Die Another Day.  If I had to pick a 5th fave - it would be a tie between Dr No (for Ursula alone) and From Russia With Love.........old man :)  .  Those are my favorite.<br /><br/>4/5 for Skyfall though.
B00A8LRIEW|4.0|If you are new to New Order, pun intended, this is *not* where you should start. Don't get me wrong, there is some good music here, but by New Order standards, this album feels like a later collection of their of B-sides. And that may not be too far from the truth. Some say this is \\"left over\\" music from Waiting for the Sirens Call, as the title would suggest. Others speculate that these are tracks that were culled from that album's sessions. After playing the album a half dozen times, I believe the truth lies somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />One dead give away to some of these tracks being initially unfinished are some very un-New Order like abrupt endings, as well as overproduction to fill out the sound on a couple songs. By contrast, some of the better tracks sound fully formed in traditional NO fashion. Once again, this leads me to believe that both possibilities exist here...some are culls, while others would have been on the New Order album that immedaitely followed Sirens Call, had that come to pass.<br /><br />But since this review may be read by many New Order newbies (yes another pun), I suggest you start with the Bad Leiutentant album, Never Cry Another Tear. That is easily the best \\"New Order\\" album made in the 00's by a decent margin. Along the same lines, the last side project album, Twisted Tenderness (00\\") holds up better than anything else other than the aforementioned 2009 release. Then once you get the feel for the NO sound, you can work your way back, album by album. Or if you are coming at this from the Joy Division direction, simply work your way forward slowly, as you adjust to the progression.<br /><br />But if you simply start with this album stone cold, I have a feeling you will be dissapointed. Even if you have heard a handful of the New Order hits from the 80's and 90's, I highly doubt you will be ready for this one. In other words, this will be one of those impulse buy CD's that you only listen to once or twice. And it would be a shame to miss out on what may actually be the most consistently solid band in the history of popular music. Once you've heard Never Cry Another Tear, you will understand what I am talking about.

I just ordered 2 more Nicholas Sparks books today and can't wait to start one!!! I want4ed to read the book first, and next, I am off to the Movie!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I enjoyed the 1st book in the trilogy and was really excited to get started on the 2nd.  I bought the book about a month ago and am less than a quarter of the way through and normally I would have finished a book by now.  It's boring and too similar to the 1st book.  I do not recommend this book or any of the others in this trilogy.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I felt I owed it to J.K. to buy this book, as her Harry Potter series gave me so many hours of reading pleasure.<br /><br />But I think unless you're from a small town in England, you will find the story fairly boring.<br />I didn't care about ANY of the character.<br />Not one iota.<br />Finished reading it only because I had spent so much on it (Kindle purchase).<br /><br />Keep trying, J.K.

I now understand why some are thriving in our challenging academic environment while others are shrinking from the same challenges. I have always said that my B student is my best student because they see the big picture with a growth mindset. They constantly seek to improve despite failures. I see this more clearly now that ever before.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Most of what goes on in this trilogy is horrific. The redemption at the end is not balanced with the awful stuff that precedes it. No way would I recommend this for adolescents.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I haven't seen the movie, but the book was so well written I don't need to see it on a screen. The style of writing was very vivid and the anticipation of future horror hung heavy. It was romantic, but kept me up late reading to see what terrible event was going to happen.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 is a masterful translation from book to movie. Much Like with the Book Deathly hallows,this movie shows a different side of Harry Potter. With Harry and Hermione on the road hunting Horcruxes and learning about the Deathly Hallows,this movie takes place away from Hogwarts and that really gives the movie a feeling of freshness,a wonderful achievement for the 7th movie in a series. I liked how,in the movie,they actually SHOW the scene of Hermione modifying her parents memories instead of just mentioning it in passing. Very poignant scene that also gives a feeling for the magnitude of the situation. And the Voldemort meeting at the start of the movie is exceptionally well done. My favorite part of the movie,though,was the Tale of the Three Brothers. The animation of the Tale of the Three Brothers was just PERFECT! I had wondered how they were going to handle that part and it turned out to be one of the most satisfying parts of the whole movie. I especially liked the portrayal of death himself. It was bloody brilliant. The emotional side worked well as well. I like the fact that,in the movie,Harry does NOT use Polyjuice Potion when returning to Godric's Hallow. The godric's Hallow scenes,from the arrival,to the graves,to harry realizing he was standing in the very spot his parents had died,would not have worked as well cinematically if Polyjuice Juice Potion had been used. In the book it was fine,but,in the movie,not using Polyjuice Potion on Harry was the way to go. Those scenes were very moving. And the emotional climax hit home for me. In the books,the most emotional death for me apart from Dumbledore in HBP is Dobby. I cried twice watching this movie,1st when Dobby dies and 2nd when harry says \\"I want to bury him,properly,without magic.\\" I've always admired the respect that Harry showed for Dobby in his death. I also think the best possible splitting point was picked. To end part 1 when Voldemort takes the Elder Wand was the perfect choice of a splitting spot. Splitting Deathly hallows into 2 movies was the right way to go. Bringing to life a different side of Harry Potter earns this movie 5 stars. :)he perfect choice of a splitting spot. Splitting Deathly hallows into 2 movies was the right way to go. Bringing to life a different side of Harry Potter earns this movie 5 stars. :)
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|In this world  we are not always taught HOW to be People, and have to either figure it out without proper role models or hoe to recognize them.  So, comes the Quintessential Self Help book we have here.. THANK you so much for the Guidance..  :-)
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Good story line.  Not edited for TV to the point that it loses the story line.  Great suspense building in the first couple episodes

B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore raps about things many others would never have the voice to speak about. He's witty, talented, and he cares about others. The music in this cd is beautiful, the rhymes are dope, and I feel as if I should have paid wayyyy more for this powerful, inspiring message.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Just finished this book and I am reading the next one...Service. I have heard Marcus many times speaking on UTube. This book is hard to read at times. I have two sons his age and I had to put it down because I was sobbing and I could not see through my tears. Marcus is a true American hero and then some!
B000EPE7AK|1.0|DVD would not play.  Tried on 3 different players.  Contacted you and per your instructions returned to Movie Mars DHL Global Mail tracking # 24439804.  Have not even got a response from them or offer of replacement.  So I lost the money I paid for the movie and the postage I paid for returning it.  Don't think I will be purchasing anymore.  Certainly can't afford to pay for something, then pay to return it and have nothing.  Could have avoided the stress and put the money directly in the shredder.  Not only that, my grandchildren were sitting on the couch looking forward to seeing the movie Grandma told them they would enjoy and it wouldn't play - hard to explain that to a 3 year old and 5 year old.  You didn't refund my money.  I purchased it from YOU not Movie Mars.  YOU should have stepped up, replaced or refunded THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE TO YOUR SUPPLIER TO HANDLE THE PROBLEM.  In the future, I guess I will purchase directly, because you certainly didn't provide ANY CUSTOMER SERVICE or SUPPORT.  Thanks for nothing.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I read this book before Chris was murdered. It has broken my heart that we have lost a great man and warrior. Chris was the epitamy of a true American hero! His story in this book is a heart pounding experience. I will read this one again!

B007PF7MGS|4.0|Instructions are very explicit - most of the recipes are very good - McDougall is still<br />passionate about his plan even after all these years.  I went on this regimen 20 years<br />ago and stayed on it (mostly) for 10 years.  There is more acceptance of Vegans now than<br />there was then.  The Plan is not as easy as it is projected because it is about changing your<br />life and the way you eat.  But, I believe in it and am looking forward to a lot of health benefits from following the plan.
B00942X8PY|5.0|Very fun and challenging. At first the game is way to easy it progressively gets more and more difficult. If you like challenging puzzle games you will enjoy this.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I'm always a little worried that Oscar winners won't be as good as everyone makes them out to be.  This movie did not disappoint.  It was well-written, had great acting, and kept me interested and on the edge of my seat.

B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I loved this movie! It was all I could have asked for in a Captain America movie; especially with Chris Evans!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the 'middle' of a great trilogy. You start to see light through the darkness of the first book.  All three books are a must read - but do so in order.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|It really took a lot from all of the other movies and packed it into one intense couple of hours. It was a great movie!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a wonderful trilogy.  You have to get through the darkness of the first book to really understand the second and third.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is awesome in incredibly insightful. Very helpful for any relationship. I would highly recommend it to anyone. That's it :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I finished this book I was not sure I wanted to continue the trilogy because it was so dark.  But, through the urgings of others, I read all three and really, really enjoyed the story.  It is well written and you get very involved in the characters lives.  You care what happens to them.  It takes all three books to complete the story and even then you want it to continue.
B003O86FMW|5.0|WOW life is really slamming KATNISS around by the end of this book man. But she has proven herself a fighter since the first book so I'm sure she'll get them good in the end.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Not to hard ,not to easy. Very stable on Motorola Xoom. The game has nice graphics and, like a good book, is just plain hard to put down.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|The book is concise and to the point. It does not use unnecessary verbiage and makes clear step-by-step process from starting to publishing. Although I would have liked something more on things to help marketing and increasing readership of the books as a small part towards the end. Otherwise it's a good read...
B001O5LVPI|5.0|Had this dvd before, my younger daughter destroy it. I was glad to find a replacement. Thank you for the DVD work great now we could enjoy it again
B002GHIPYI|5.0|I have owned a lot of headphones. Skullcandy, Sennheiser, Apple, Sony, Phillips, etc. I am very picky on what I like and I listen to a lot of music of all kinds. In the studio my Sennheiser HD 280s are my headphones. Everywhere else is these Superlux. They are extremely comfortable and have a very crispy, clean and clear tone to them. I noticed a little bit of burn in was required. 10 hours or so. Maybe more. They don't LOOK extremely high quality as some parts give the look of cheap plastic, but do not be fooled. Pretty good build quality; just take care of them! Cord is very long though, be aware of that. Highly recommended headphone overall though. Amazing price vs. sound.<br /><br />Other headphones I recommend are the Koss Portapros! Those are good for more low-key look.
0062014536|4.0|I loved this entire series and will definitely keep it to read again, but the ending was very abrupt and unsatisfying. Readers want to know what happened to the characters they fell in love with and you don't get that here. When I turned the last page and realized it was over, I was disappointed. We needed just a little bit more. But otherwise, I loved the series and I love Lauren's writing.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My 6 year old grandson said that it was funny. He liked the story. I would purchase it again. Thanks
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A most elegant soap opera.  That's really what it is, in a sense.  Intrigue, underhanded scheming, romance, love.  But it's also a glimpse into how far women have come and how things have changed.  The set, the actors, and little things like the tea china are all captivating as well.  I'm in!
B005LAII12|5.0|This movie is almost and instant must have for your collection no matter how you store media (good luck finding this on an laser disc)

B00AYDC3CG|2.0|I rented this to watch with the kids (ages 7 and 9) and wasn't too impressed. It didn't keep my 7 year old's attention and probably didn't help that the whole movie was in black and white. It was a typical Tim Burton movie.... had some good parts, but wouldn't necessarily recommend.
B00BS4U8VS|1.0|I purchased last weeks episode and it played perfectly so I decided to purchase this week as well.  It has been 40 minutes now and i am not even 5 minutes into the movie because of all the freezing and buffering.  I even tried restarting my computer in case there were too many apps running in the background. I have a great connection and there should be no reason for this.  I am very frustrated!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Same review as &#34;Beautiful Creatures&#34;. Easy and quick read. Keeps you sucked into it and wanting more. Have recommended this series to friends.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|This unit requires additional amplification to be used effectively.  The in-line amplifier, the thing on the cord with the switch and battery, does not supply enough power to the mic.  You get better sound pickup from the internal microphone of an iPad.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|This movie was very entertaining for the whole family. Our 7 and 9 year olds loved this movie and it had enough humor that I liked it as well. This would be a movie I would consider buying.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|Crosshairs of the sniper scope are easy to visualize, as well as the perpetual dust and heat that Chris Kyle experienced day in and day out as a Navy Seal Sniper in Afghanistan. His autobiography seems a very honest and personal portrayal of the trials and tribulations not only in the war zone, but also on the home front.  His wife's experience, (interspersed throughout the book in snippets written in her own hand) reflects her sacrifice in dealing with the extended absence of her husband and father to their child, and adds a third dimension to the familiar story of a soldier at war.  Kyle was born and bred to be the ultimate warrior, and his story honors his service and his name.  Showing his willingness to unabashedly expose himself to danger to 'get the job done', Kyle deserves great credit.  The reader is able to share the gut-wrenching experience of a Navy Seal Sniper at war, but likely from the safety of a home shielded by the sacrifice and service of Kyle and other heros like him.

B008GWOVB8|5.0|I have always loved this movie more than any at all. John Travolta was the perfect fit for the character.<br />This movie is the best of any musical with well done dance moves for the era. I normally do not watch<br />musicals, but this movie has a place in my heart. The greesers to the pink ladies. If you've never watched this movie,<br />it's recommended beyond the 5 star rating. If I could, I'd give it a 10. Most people who loved this one<br />never really gave the sequel a real chance, but I love them both.

B0000AUHPB|5.0|This is the original movie from 1969, not the more current remake.  It is whimsical, and funny with a great chase sequence reminiscent of a Keystone Cops caper.  After viewing the remake I had to track down a copy of the original that I remembered seeing in my youth.  Michael Caine is great as the leader of a band of crooks as they pull off an impossible feat using a unique and clever approach.  Plot twists arise as the crew finds itself between two powerful criminal elements, each wanting their piece of the operation.  This movie can pull you in and hold your attention without blowing up everything in sight and stacking up a huge body count.  Watch this movie; it is great entertainment and just a fun movie to watch.

B004VD3YIM|5.0|Have about five IP cameras configured and works like clockwork.  Seems like its association with Amazon - for licensing purposes I'm told - can be a little sensitive.  If you are using multiple cameras you must be cleared by Amazon - or other app provider - for that functionality to work properly.  Have been using tinyCam for over a year and all of a sudden for some reason that connection no longer exists - time to call tech support.

0465022227|2.0|So the author starts the book by giving so many scary stories about PhDs who fail to make the right decision during or after the graduation, so they end up with jobs that are beneath their levels or unsatisfactory. Although I agree with him that these things happen, I believe that collecting all of these sorts of stories in a tiny book like this and make it sound like this is the real life after graduation is misleading.<br />There are several good points raised in the book, but I think the cynical writing style made me not take it seriously.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this!!!!! So fun to eat stuff!!!! I have a particular fondness of going to the first right beach and eating crabs &amp; scoring humans.

B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|The man who fell to earth is still rocking my world. I was tempted to rate this 5-stars, but I have a feeling that that last star would simply be an acknowledgment of my great joy of having this album come out after a 10-year absence. In the long run, I think this is really a rock-solid 4-star album, another high point in Bowie's late-career era.<br /><br />Listening to the album, it's as though there were no gap between Heathen, Reality, and The Next Day. It's not quite the Berlin Trilogy (how could it be?) but it's a run of albums that shows a master craftsman at work. David Bowie and Tony Visconti working together produces outstanding music, and that's all there is to it.<br /><br />The songs are varied, the production crisp. It's by turns emotional, fun, rhythmic, and always interesting. I hope this doesn't end up being Bowie's final album, but, if it is, I'm glad it's here.

The app would close down every time, no explanation, no ability to get back in to the game. Really disappointed. I had read the reviews and wanted a chance to play.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|Very entertaining and a little different from what Julian Fellows normally does well.  I was enchanted with the time-travel mystery.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The quality and fast shipment is great!!! I am a collector of James Bond things and already have the other movies!!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|action, thinking involved, quick reaction, you will enjoy this game, as well as your kids, kind of repetitive though, so.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was hooked immediately after I watched the first episode of season 1. Had to keep going to get caught up!!! Now finished season 3. Can't wait for more!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game 41 year old cant get enough children watch me play.Wish the chearacters had special moves.The dog on the Easter version should be a rabbit
B00B18MQ7K|5.0|I downloaded the album Electric by Richard Thompson because I have always liked his music, his guitar, and his lyrics.  It was easy to buy and download on Amazon and Richard Thompson never disappoints.  This is easily his best album since Sweet Warrior and after listening to him being interviewed on the radio, I was smitten.  I listen to it often and if you are a Richard Thompson fan, you will love it too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! Great story, interesting plot, a lot of suspense. Much better than the movie. After reading this book, you must read the other two parts.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|I am surprised and stunned that this movie was not recognized in the foreign film category of the Oscars this year.
B000000OSE|5.0|My husband loves this band and this genre of music and he absolutely loved this cd for his b - day.
0345803507|5.0|This was really a sweet love story, the growth of each character was amazing, I did enjoy the books and wondered why it took me so long to order them
0439023513|5.0|My daughter had to read the first book for a class project and was so taken in that she had me order the rest of the books.

B001NHNG64|5.0|The \\"Reacher\\" series is great \\"brain\\" candy (as my friends call it). The read is quick and exhilarating.  I'd recommend the book to anyone who is interested in thriller or murder mystery.
B000000OSG|5.0|My husband loves this band and this genre of music and he absolutely loved this cd for his b - day.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|Good for all ages. The characters are good to look at and believable. I like the story a lot. Awesome
B007VUCAVO|5.0|this app is a lifesaving app. I love it. It is much easier to charge because I know when to charge it before it dies.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The story was very predictible and the end left you in the dark about the characters future. Not the best Nicholas Sparks.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|Very nicely laid out multi function calculator with numerous conversion factors and applications.  Really improves upon the power of built in calculators.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is beautifully written. There is a very appealing quirkiness to the writing. There are delightful surprises of association in the descriptions, like &#34;All was dark-skied and hazy, and small chips of rain were starting to fall&#34;, and &#34;the moon was sewn into the sky that night.  Clouds were stitched around it.&#34; The story is very moving.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a very good solitaire game. The only negative remark is about the ads - they are a bit more annoying than acceptable
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Well written, great way to pass the time.  I would have preferred to simply give the star-rating as its  not my habit nor interest to write reviews.  But since  Amazon requires a written comment;  I'm writing this simply because I wanted to give it a &#34;5-star&#34; rating.  I'll happily enjoy reading another of the author's book.  That's it -  I'll leave the more detailed written reviews to those more talented than myself.
B008PZZV8S|5.0|This is a very good movie and I thought that it was played well. See this movie if you can.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Once again Peter Jackson & team have done a masterful job immersing both the dyed-in-the-wool Tolkien fan and the best albeit honest movie critic in the lore of Middle Earth.<br /><br />I have read \\"The Hobbit\\" twice, once to myself and once to my children.  It is not hard to notice that Jackson both changed parts of the story, created others, and inserted events to link movies about the Hobbits directly to his movies about the ring. Theses changes did not ruin my fondness for or memories of the book.  Peter Jackson did a great job staying true to Tolkien while putting his own stamp on the story.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|This product is a high quality processor. I bought a lot and everything is ok the thing is it doesnt Support dual AMD graphics
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Best show ever. I absolutely love chuck and blair. They are my favorite. Chuck and blair are so sweet and romantic.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Got right into the story, great book can't put it down would recommend this book on of my favorites  love it
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|This is the best scan app by far. The saving in the PDF makes the difference in all the other apps tried.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great read that was suspenseful & I enjoyed every page!  I would definitely recommend this book -
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Great movie. Not just for kids. Adults would like this as well. Took me back to my childhood with a lot of the various video game references.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie was very well made.  The story was interesting and suspenseful.  I would definitely recommend this movie for people interested in historical political events.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Heart touching. Must read even if you aren't a dog lover. I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it!
B000OVLIQU|5.0|How many Beatles books can you read before they all seem the same? This was a fantastic book and from such a different point of view. At times I felt like I was sitting in the recording studio. I enjoyed this and believe most Beatles fans would.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always enjoyed playing solitaire, so when this was available, I got it., and I play it often, thanks.
B00003CXXI|1.0|i bought this for my daughter and its about this ugly green creature with a SCOTTISH accent, a fat ass and a fat stomach.  totally stupid and then eddie murray plays the donkey ass.<br /><br /> It just gets worse as the time goes by. Just goes to show you what  a lot of power these studios have to push crap like this and the lion king and people like it.<br /><br /> there was nothing in here even remotely aesthetic and beautiful. Shrek farts and burps and anything else disgusting you can think of which they portray as funny. It also has a lot of violence in it that scares kids.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|The case was a beautiful shade of purple and the leather was expertly finished. The swivel allows the kindle to be rotated 360 degrees to meet any format requirement.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This latest continuation of the Jack Ryan series is true to Tom Clancy's well researched, realistic form.  It is impossible to not relate the events in this story to the existing state of the real world and entertain the possibility of the events unfolded as really happening.  There are, of course, for the sake of this story, some leaps and assumptions that do not exist politically and with persons in high power that do not exist.  But it doesn't take much of a stretch of imagination to envision a similar group of characters that could generate a like situation.<br /><br />Great stuff!  One of the best of the series.  I have read them all.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love, LOVE this show!! If you're into the whole zombie thing this is an excellent series! Many exciting twists and turns!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I loved the movie, but it stopped so many times, it was out of sync. kept rebooting, I tried to watch it twice and gave up. Amazon you've got work to do.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I really liked this novel. It was great romance. Easy read. And fast read. Two thumbs up for sure<br /> ; )
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|It is really hard to find a series of full length movies in a set like this at this price.  If you're a fan of the original Star Trek crew then this is a great collection to have.  Thoroughly enjoyed these.
1419705849|5.0|Hahahaha of course you'll love it, its a great book, what do you think !😄 It will last a long time because its a hard cover and I'm also going to let my brother and friends read it
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|None of the &#34;charm&#34; of the original, no heart, no passion, no soul. This is not a fun movie to watch. If you want a futuristic thriller, check out Looper.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I guess the next time my friends tell me not to spend my time with a book, best seller list or not, I will pay more attention to them.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this book with my book club and everyone loved it! It's a great read and you get sucked in. I'd highly recommend it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|If u haven't read this series, which is unlikely, then u have to, it's the best book series ever!!!! !
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|This game is very good at teaching. My 4 year old little girl loves it. She thinks she now has a garden like grandpa.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|both intriguing and thrilling -- this movie puts faces and names to real life events that took place when I was in middle school.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My granddaughter loves this one and enjoys cooking and finding the coustomers. She plays and giggles as they eat the entire dish so quickly. Very fun
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed - well-written, well-acted, good pace so you didn't get bored.  Liked the re-enactments, thought they were actual footage at first.  Also made you think - definitely recommend!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This one is a little hard for my 3 year old granddauther but the four year old loves it. It is a little more in detail and harder to understand than most of the games we have bought. It is one that I have to help her with.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|Overall entertaining movie with a good cast.  Very balanced in terms of boy & girl characters.<br />I was expecting more than cameos from some of my favorite characters.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel played an airline Captain with &#34;issues&#34; perfectly.. In my lifetime, I've known two who suffered from the &#34;addiction&#34; depicted in this movie.  Their lives were just as Denzel showed us....highest of highs....lowest of lows.  The technical aspects of having to &#34;roll&#34; the aircraft to reach a &#34;stable&#34; flight situation is not, at all, a Hollywood invention.  Under the particular situation the aircraft was flying...the roll was believable and executed to achieve level flight.  Most people in this world are not aware of the fact that aircraft, of every size and description with no mechanical problems,  fly better &#34;hands off&#34; than with pilot input.however, without the inventive &#34;roll&#34;...there was nowhere but down...and this pilot knew it from his experience.  I, personally, found &#34;Flight&#34; to be involving and believable.
B00BJA2VFW|1.0|when i try to enter player name the keyboard on my kindle fire 8.9 will not go away.  it even stays 'on' when i return to the kindle home screen.<br /><br />i have to shut it down to get rid of the keyboard display<br />.complete waste of money

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|What great life concepts set out in an enjoyable story format! I will be thinking about these ideas for a long time. This book is a keeper!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book keep your interest and had some surprises that made it quite a different story! It is good for 30 year olds and everyone older.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|If you like the Harry Bosch novel series, this is a good one.  Kept me on the edge as always!
B00338QENI|5.0|There are so many things that I learned from this book. I highly recommend it if you are love to read about biology and the ways cell play a role in modern medicine.
B000I9X668|5.0|Having worked in hightech offices for most of my life, this movie hits the mark for the absurb &#34;corporate culture&#34; that some of the companies had - and perhaps why so many failed. :) This movie pokes fun at alot of the absurbities that were part of the office environment, the chain restaurants, etc. If you ever worked in a hightech office, you may find yourself associating many of the characters with people you work/used to work with. This is an all-time classic.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|Froze my kindle.  Hard to play.<br />Wanted newer songs.  Hard to manuveor while in game. Never again.  No real help available

B007MCTTHY|5.0|No permissions, no ads, small file size, stable on my Samsung galaxy SII, clean display easy to read, fun to solve puzzle by swapping tiles with tubing shapes to complete the path. This is a keeper.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is really fun i love it and i like that it is free and i play it a lot on my kindle
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|This is a very cool and unique album. Worth buying for the good mix of songs on the album. Would recommend purchasing.
0765334798|4.0|This book is an entertaining read for those who feel an amused affection for the original Star Trek series. (Note: the connection to Star Trek is less direct than one might assume from the title.) Seeing the premise, I wondered where Scalzi would take it, and was pleased with how the characters resolved their seemingly insoluble dilemma.<br /><br />I particularly liked the three \\"Codas\\" at the end, which delve deeper into the emotional and philosophical implications of the story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is beautiful and a little gory but a beautiful, beautiful book. I love this book, it's a very good book
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I bought this mic over a year ago and never took it out of the box. Today I finally opened the box and was a little disappointed that there were no instructions included. I used the mic and did some videos to test the sound and lighting and when I downloaded the videos and watched them on my computer the sound was horrible - very quiet with lots of background hiss and static noise. I googled for a solution and quite a few other people had the same problem and were chalking it up to getting a defective unit. Bummer! BUT several people suggested some reasons why it might sound like this:<br />1. If the mic battery is low<br />2. If you installed the battery upside down<br />3. If you touched the battery contacts and the oils from your finger got on it.<br />4. If you are using a mono/stereo adapter that is not working<br />5. If you have not set the camera setting to external mic<br />6. If your video camera battery is low<br />7. If the mic is not turned on<br />My problem turned out to be a combination of 3,4,5,6 above. I corrected it and then did a test video and the sound is perfect! I'm very happy with my purchase!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great trilogy. Very easy and enjoyable read. Watched the movie and made me want to know the rest of the story. Finished all three books in a week and a half.
B005ZO6NRA|5.0|Good movie. Played without a hitch.  Not better than the original, but still enjoyable.  Lots of action. Story line OK.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|The dynamism of Tolstoy's novel did translate into the film. The end seems crumpled, though. I also appreciated the theater-motif. The actress who plays Kitty is superb. Levin is little too kidish, so is Vronsky who should be a stout military man, accordning to the novel, not a curly teenager.<br />The movie certainly does not follow the book closely, which, however, may be considered a benefit. But it gives the wrong impression of the book.<br />The film is mostly for those who did read the book and watch most of the numerous film adaptations since the 1920-s and got tired of them - then this is a refreshing pleasure for a relaxing evening. Produces a wonderfully vibrant impression after the dull and mediocre 2009 Soloviev version.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Exciting, I totally love the action and the relationships developed during the program. I hope it goes on for many seasons.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|It's an easy and fun game to play!  Give me a chance to use the left hand verses right hand coordination.  It's a must have:)
B005QI4TP8|4.0|I know nothing about The Machine and this CD.  I gave it as a gift and the recipient really appreciated it.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Good story telling, never really boring although a bit maudlin in places, but does not detract from the experience.<br />Recommend to those who loved the Data character - a must read for them.
B004JHYRAE|3.0|While this book contains some fantastic points and ideas, occasionally little bits of hippie language and idealism slip through. I found it hard to focus on the ideas I was curious about because of these slips. I will look for another book that is less so.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I liked this DVD although the sound wasn't as good as I thought it should be. I was pleased that the disc didn't jump like some others that I have bought from Amazon. Nothing irritates me more that a DVD that jumps!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Better than I had expected!! A problem that I hope never to be involved in, in an airplane or a car or anywhere else for that matter..
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Really takes you on a journey, a nice story to relax and enjoy. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Sick & Stupid Score: 9/5*<br /><br />Another sick Hollywood movie, cunningly marketed as a \\"thoughtful\\" movie.  We had to dump this movie at the one-hour mark, after a full frontal nudity party and the second Master(bation) scene.  We should have dumped the movie after the first ten minutes when we were exposed to a beach scene of sailors having simulated sex with a female sand sculpture and Master(bating) into the ocean.  But we hoped the sick part was over with, and the movie might redeem itself.  No such luck.<br /><br />Stay away from this movie.  There cannot be any deep psychology in this movie or any ultimate moral value if it must first descend into borderline pornography.<br />________________________________<br />* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid. A Score of 10/10 indicates the movie is so gross and idiotic no one should watch it; whereas a Score of 0/0 is a perfect movie.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I enjoyed the book and the characters. Time travel is something I have just started to enjoy in my readings. The history is something I enjoy most from the novel.
B002N44XSG|5.0|READ THIS AMAZING BOOK and READ ALL OF RICK RIORIDANS BOOKS. THEY. ARE. AMAZINGLY AWESOME AND NEED TO BE READ BY EVERYONE IN THIS ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEM
B00BHMF578|4.0|A good movie, I don't know about best of the year. But a good movie that moves at a good pace. I would recommend it
B0063M22QO|4.0|Finding two images that are exactly alike is fun but sort of nonsensical. Not something to spend much time on but okay as a break when reading a challenging book.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Most films appeal to either a male or a female, but this film was equally enjoyed by both me and my husband!  I enjoyed the intellectual suspense, eye candy and drama, while my husband enjoyed those AND the high action scenes.  It was very tense: was 007 going to die this time?  I did not have the suspense figured out, so I enjoyed the whole aspect of the film.  Photography was breathtaking!
1616550414|5.0|This book is exactly what it advertises itself as-a book all about Zelda. If you want to learn about The Legend of Zelda, go no further than this book. Recommended!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I enjoyed the first two seasons, but this is- by far- the best. We see the characters struggle - we watch them grow and change in the face of unspeakable horror. Incredibly well acted.
B00AO686MY|1.0|Ok let me start by saying This has nothing to do with Amazon.com nor do I hate the movie in and of itself. In fact it was a big favorite of mine.  I saw the movie in the theater.  It was an amazing work.  Fastforward 3 years later when it came to VHS.  I noticed several lines and scenes were cut from the movie for home release.<br /><br /> 1)The early scene where Eddie Valient talks with Brer Bear is gone.  2)In the night club where Donald and Daffy Duck have their piano duel Daffy originaly said&#34;Of course you realize this means war.&#34;  It's cut to him only saying &#34;This means war.&#34;  3) The scene Roger and Eddie are handcuffed in his office and the weasles come to investigate:  Smart Ass(yes that is the lead weasle's name) Asks &#34;Where's Da rabbit?&#34; Eddies the said &#34; You mean  the one with the orange pants, long ears, and clodhopper feet?&#34;  SA:  &#34;Yeah.&#34;  Eddie:  &#34;Haven't seen him.&#34;  This is cut to &#34;Where's the rabbit?&#34; &#34;Haven't seen him.&#34;  Sure took away one of the funniest parts to me. 4)When Roger and Eddie are hiding out in the movie theater Eddie tells Roger and Delores &#34; I just don't get the connection between R K Maroon and Cloverleaf.&#34;  Shortly a news reel comes up explaining R. K. Maroon and Cloverleaf became business partners which proved the conection.  Am I cursed with an excellent memory?<br />Maybe/not.<br /><br />Now that is off my chest I figured when it came out on DVD it would be fully restored.  Wrong.  Yes it was widescreen which is an improvement but not restored.<br />Yes, I was disappointed.<br /><br />Now I saw it come to Blu Ray and 25th anniversary  I thought &#34;Surely for this edition it would finally be fully theatically restored.&#34;  I was crest fallen.  I mean compared the regular DVD there is little else to offer in the movie nor the bonus features. The picture and sound qualities were only slightly better than DVD edition.<br /><br />This why I gave an otherwise great film a crappy rating.  I would give it a half star if I could.<br /><br />If you are generally a fan of WFRR and want it on Blu Ray, buy it. If you are like me and expected more out of it with this edition you will be disappointed.  Am I being too nitpicky? Maybe so.  I do feel I was ripped off buying it.  I felt apprhensive in the checkout line.  I wish I had followed my gut.lf star if I could.  If you are generally a fan of WFRR and want it on Blu Ray, buy it. If you are like me and expected more out of it with this edition you will be disappointed.  Am I being too nitpicky? Maybe so.  I do feel I was ripped off buying it.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love the different levels of this game and it was free.  This is my favorite Mahjong game by far!!
B006VGGAC4|3.0|I read this book out of curiosity, to see how AS had become such an important figure in many fields, to learn more about such a a rich and exciting life and to see how he was able to put it in writing.<br />The story is fun, documented and interesting but not exciting though it could have been, maybe just a little flat because of the quality of the prose<br />A book ok to read on a plane trip but not a must have
B007KOMTUI|4.0|Style, plot, great writing and great actors make this show a hit. Set in the age of my parents youth this show is a must watch.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I started listening to Tegan and Sara when The Con came out.  I loved that song and still think it is one of the best songs of the past 15 years.  I bought all their albums, and then Sainthood when it was released.  I'm not a big fan of acoustic music, but I like just about any song with a good melody.  Songs like \\"My Number\\" are among my favorites, but I prefer the more rock and pop music they've done.  So Jealous was my favorite T&S album until Heartthrob.<br /><br />I always thought T&S had a bit of '80s influence in their music, especially the So Jealous album, \\"The Con\\" single, and some songs on Sainthood.  I love that they took it further.  There isn't a bad track on this album.  I've played it, or parts of it, almost every day since it was released.  Bought the CD, and also the vinyl for a nostalgic feeling.  It's great music to enjoy, especially if you like pop, new wave, or electro-pop.  The album has a complexity to it like someone else mentioned.  I hear something different in it each time I play it, and I'm not tired of it after many repeat plays.<br /><br />My favorites are I Was a Fool, Drove Me Wild, Shock to Your System, Closer, and I Couldn't Be Your Friend.  The rest are good too, but sometimes blend together in sound.  Still, it doesn't really matter to me that there isn't a lot of variety, because it's such a good sound throughout the album.  It's less rock than So Jealous, but even that album had synths and pop-type songs on it.  My one complaint about Heartthrob would be that the bonus tracks are not on the CD.  So glad Amazon gave them as a download with the CD purchase.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|It worked fine for me, until i had it delete a movie file i had just watched. it deleted all my video files. beware.
B0063IH60K|5.0|New to the Kindle Fire, I've been looking for fun ways to learn how to use touch-screen technology. Solitude has always been a favorite game, so when this came up with a high rating, it looked like a good app to try. It really is well presented and fun to use and play. Now I just need to find more like it.

0425264351|4.0|First, let me say that I am not a big fan of mystery/thriller novels. But, my book club chose this, so I was obligated to read it. The voice threw me off at first - Reacher's narrative with short, choppy sentences read like the old Dragnet series, \\"Just the facts, Ma'am.\\" The plot drew me into the story, however, and without realizing it, I found myself enjoying the book. I really didn't expect this, so I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Violence is graphically depicted, so be aware of this before you pick up this book.
B0002KZAKS|3.0|For the price its a pretty good mic. The sound and build quality of this mic is amazing. Definitely a good buy
B00B7G23KQ|1.0|Not as good as the others. Movie really didn't follow the previous Paranormal Activity movies and didn't try very hard to tie in to them. Boring
B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|I'm sure this book was written for readers younger than I, but it seemed to me that the writing was a bit simplistic.  The storyline was okay.  It held my interest but I was often distracted by editing errors and choppy sentence structure.  Huff develops likeable characters and gives you a good feel for the worlds he creates so I wish he would have taken a little more time in releasing the book and spent that time refining.  I do see promise here, though, and I hope the next book shows some growth.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I was really looking forward to seeing the movie Argo having listened to the hype on the TV networks and Awards venues. The experience was spoiled by the number of times I had to shut off and reload the movie because it froze. I guess i picked a bad day to watch it, maybe there was too many people watching movies on Amazon Prime,
B00A03WBVI|5.0|I love this album. I think &#34;Take Me Home&#34; is much better than the first album. I only wish there was a 6 star rating.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie very much. It has plenty of suspense, mystery, and overall action to hold your attention from the beginning to the end of the picture. Great Movie!
B001EOOQEM|5.0|I use to listen only Black Sabbath with Ozzy. This record with Dio, realy surprise-me! It's one of best Black Sabbath record.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Amazing great emotion. I love this book it I'd very well written.read this if you like great stories. Love it
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Sick for the price....you can't beat this album. Amazing...a definite must have if you are a fan of hip hop.
0307895475|5.0|Amazing book art work was awesome I honestly had no idea on how big skyrim really was all the side quest just keep you nusy
B0074MZSWW|1.0|I was excited to buy this CD after seeing the Alabama Shakes on SNL.  But the engineering is horrendous.  Sounds like it was recorded in someone's garage and mixed by a deaf person.  It's unlistenable.  The sonic quality is extremely poor.  I went on line and watched a couple of live recordings, and the sound quality is great - so it's not the band.  What a disservice to the band and to the music.<br /><br />It might be OK if you are listening to the CD with ear buds.  But if you are going to play the CD on a decent stereo, prepare yourself.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite games. It has great graphics and lots of challenging levels. Only one suggestion. When I play on the zombies side I noticed that not all the units you face are available to use when playing as the samurai.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loving this series! So many delightful characters. My husband and I enjoy watching it together. Love the costumes! Watch it!
B00B2064IY|5.0|sounds familiar and brand new. can't believe how well this stands up to time, and beats most anything out there in terms of heart and soul.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|One of the more challenging \\"race\\" games. Moves fast, good graphics, cool sound effects. I like this very much. A great way to waste time!!
B0098G7AWS|3.0|Nice fictional account, but not close to being realistic.  Neither from a technical perspective or a social norms.  The special effects were good for the time.
B000FC1HBY|2.0|i am a huge fan of the TV show, and thought i should pick up this book. i was very disappointed.<br />the writing is repetitive, full of cliches, and tries to sound smarter that it is.<br />noblemen are called &#34;ser&#34; instead of &#34;sir&#34;, the leader of the horse-riding nomad people is called &#34;khal&#34; instead of &#34;khan&#34;... changing one letter of an existing word isn't really all that imaginative, is it? it ruins vcertain aspects for me, as it constantly reminds me that this guy wasn't trying all that hard.<br /><br />i still enjoy the show, as the performances are generally great (with the exceptions of the annoying &#34;khaleesi&#34;), but the book really was a huge letdown.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|A harrowing story describing a snipers duties when deployed. However without taking too much away from the story itself, I felt it was a bit of an ego trip for the author.He deserved all the kudos he got from his experience but not a book I would recommend for our troops from NZ.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded this for my tween and have not been able to put it down ever since! Very easy to learn and quite time consuming.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Kids love this game. It can get addictive, I personally like the subway concept better than temple run! Pretty cool game!
0316056871|5.0|Seriously this is the funniest book I've ever read. I liked Tina Fey before. I love her now. I couldn't help from laughing audibly as I read it on an airplane (I don't think my fellow passengers appreciated that).The book is so well written the narrative flows so easily. The book ends too soon. I feel like she opens her entire life to you and it's still not enough.<br />There are a few parts that I believe women may be able to appreciate better than men, but I think anyone with a sense of humor can appreciate the book.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|One of my top Disney movies! Had some sad, happy, funny moments. Had it all. Entertaining from start to finish, great movie for kids and adults too!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Life can be hard growing up with mental health issues and this book addressed this struggle in a caring and beautiful way. these characters feel like your friends or classmates and you find yourself rooting for them even when they makes mistakes or wrong choices.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|The Daily Workouts have really gotten my butt into shape. Literally. I've been trying to loose these extra pounds, but was too shy and self conscious to go to a gym, let alone work out outside of the privacy of my own home. The app is real simple and FREE. HELLO! Even the five min workouts had me sore the next morning. I love that I can access them whenever I want and you don't really need anything more than just you and some free time.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Has a nice sound when it goes off, waking me up.....why must I keep typing even after I have said what I want to say...
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Hopeless is my first book of Colleen Hoover's. WOW. Just..WOW. I enjoyed reading this book but sometimes I had to put it down because it just felt so intense. The raw emotions felt so real. so..intense. Honestly this book was a fantastic read.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What a wonderful series! So full of twists, turns, and family drama! Can't wait for Season 4!! I love all the characters!
B001VLXNLU|3.0|A friend of mine really wanted me to read this book series after she looked through my collection of book on my Kindle. I thought, 'Hey why not! If it's anything like what I read then it couldn't be all that bad.' I was wrong. I was SO wrong. I'm giving it three stars for my friend but if it were me I'd have never read this book. Personally it was just way too teenish. And this from someone who actually enjoys YA Romances. I couldn't get past all of the catty things the main character kept thinking. So was constantly judging people and constantly judging stereotypes.  It was just plain annoying.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is an excellent series and I would recommend it to anyone. It takes you on a journey with the characters. I could not put it down until I was finished.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|PhotoEditor+ was something I had bought for my Kindle after buying the Camera app as well. I wanted something to edit the pictures if I could without having to first upload them to my PC or Laptop. This works really well and is very easy to pick up. Most if not all of my pictures I post go through this app before FaceBook. haha.<br /><br />My only issue with it, and its not a big one, is that it has limited filters. You can buy more but honestly I don't feel the need because the ones on there look so pretty already.<br /><br />I would say if you like your pictures to have that extra..Oomf..then get this app.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|This is definitely a fun game... the only downside is that its one of those games where you have to wait a certain amount of time before your &quot;lives&quot; regenerate so you can play again, which is the only reason for it not getting five stars. other than that, I love it.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|The app is a little slow and the music is SO very ANNOYING. But I love looking at all the stars and on a cloudy night, or a night I can't get out, I can sit in bed and look at this.
141659521X|5.0|It's funny.  I am concerned about the President having unilateral power to decide who to kill, and then sending in a drone to do it; and the collateral damage be damned, and yet I'm rooting for Mitch Rapp  and Irene kennedy all the way.<br /><br />What really scared me was Joe Beiden's comment when someone complained that the drone strike on Alawaki (an American) also killed his sixteen year old boy--&#34;Well, he should have chosen better parents.&#34;
B0010OIN90|5.0|my son very like this watch, and very light to he used. very compact but i not yet know how long lifetime this watch
B002ZG9788|5.0|Was exactly what I needed and shipped and arrived on time o o o o o o o o o o
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this serious, funny and classy drama.  It has drawn us into the characters as if they were part of our family.  It also portrays all characters as human beings who believe in the part they play in life.  Can't wait for more.
B00BJA2VFW|3.0|I recently got into more casual gaming and went looking for a \\"match 3\\" game. I read a lot of reviews and finally settled on Jewel Legends Tree of Life.<br /><br />Initially I was enjoying it a lot. It has good graphics and enough variety to keep it interesting, however, as I went up in levels I began to tire of the suggested move that pops up if I don't make a move within a certain amount of time. I've looked for a way to turn this off, and certainly, I may just be missing it, but I cannot change this behavior and it is ruining the fun for me. I don't want to be told where the move is! I want more time to look for it!<br /><br />Equally annoying is a behavior I've began experiencing in the mid range levels, I'll be making a match, and on the completely opposite side of the board, I'll see a quick movement. The game is \\"gaming\\" itself! With 100% reliability, I will be able to find the next move exactly where the game set it up! This completely ruins the sense of a challenge. It makes it feel like I'm just sitting there pushing buttons which is causing me to lose all interest which is a bummer, because I want to keep playing. That and I paid for it.<br /><br />Finally, I feel that this apps asks for to many permissions. Not an unusually large number, but I really like it when a paid app asks for little to no permissions. There are some out there. Check out \\"Rebuild\\" and the permissions it requires as an example of a ethical app. I can see free versions collecting data, seems a fair trade, but not a paid app.
B004OZZ624|5.0|great movie.  kept you in complete suspense throughout the movie never knowing what would happen next.  plot was great and the actors were amazing as well!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|first time I have ever played this type of game.  makes you stop and think. graphics and colors are great
B005EGXTL2|3.0|Nowhere near as good as the first two in the trilogy. Stretches the imagination too far and delivers a highly predictable ending.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was actually the first Nicholas Sparks book I had ever read. Safe Haven was so well-written and compelling, and the characters were well-developed, that I went on to download several more books by Sparks onto my Kindle!
B00005R8GU|5.0|outstanding blues a great group of musicians. nice that the next generation came to bring a true artist to light
1416523359|5.0|arrived in a timely manner and has quickly become one of my all time favorite king books. his beast since the failure of the DT series
B000002OAZ|5.0|with the next wave of musicians that joined one of the all time greats how could it get any better. Red rooster was out of the park good. not a miss on the disc
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it is fun to play.  I play this game all the time. My mom even play.And this game is not gross.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This movie is funny as it is up lifting. I heard they're remaking an English version. I hope they don't ruin it.
0783233477|5.0|I thoroughly loved it. brad pitt's performance was awesome anthony hopkins a seasoned actor brad is my all time favorite actor
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|It's Richard Thompson for God's sake.  You can't find another artist on the planet who in the triathlon of musicianship, songwriting, and singing exceeds the talents of Richard.<br />Another record of his that demands to be listened to.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Bring it on...... book three that is! I can't wait to see what is going to happen next. Just when you think you are at a lull something scorchingly scandalous happens.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If it weren't for the article in the WSJ last week I would never of come across these amazing stories. A warning to those who have yet to start, the first one is free for a reason. Once you start you will not be able to stop. Enjoy it while it lasts.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|this is a great show hope it's on a long time.love all the actors and the stories. you will too.
B001B9BEF4|5.0|The best soundtrack to the modern Noir you've never seen.<br />Raw, and yet so full of power and imagery. You wont be disappointed.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I never thought I'd find something to replace the hole that LOST left with me. Beautiful cinematography. And Jessica Lange nails it!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Very enjoyable, a little slow to start (series wise) but I highly recommend this for fans of X-Files, and a good Sci-Fi series, etc.
B0049985XW|5.0|Greed is graphically portrayed in this magnificent film. Havent seen it for thirty years shows the versatility of the actor
B0025X4OYI|5.0|See above.  Ray insisted on doing this one over objections from many people, but as usual he aced it.  This is country music like it has never been done before.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|There is something about every song on here that I like and there are a couple songs I play over and over and over. She has such an incredible voice and rhythm. She will make it big but in a way I'd rather she didn't...don't want to ruin it.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|I saw this movie three time when it came out at the theatres. I loved everything about this movie (i.e. storyline, graphics, color. I knew I would own this as soon as it became availble.
030758836X|4.0|This book is amazingly well-written. The writer has done some serious character building. I loved the ending too. It was different and unpredictable. I think some part could have been edited as it slows down the pace a bit. Overall- a good suspense thriller.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Another Disney great! If you love video game then you will love this movie. What more can I say, watch the movie!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Everyone should read this book because it is amazing and astonishing the way it ends . It it it it it it
B000SW2ER2|5.0|This is one of the best science-fiction films out there, in my opinion.  The story symbolizes a psychological exploration of hidden dreams, desires, and shadows in the mind, told in a compelling way.  The movie also contains some beautiful visuals.  One of my favorites science-fiction films.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I love The Shield, and would give the whole series a 5-star rating. I'm rewatching it for the first time since it ended, and I've realized that although this season is good, it is only setting the stage for the rest of the whole series. Someone who watched just this first season would probably be left wanting more; fortunately, there are six more seasons to satiate that desire! The finale of this show is one of the best I've ever seen for any series.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Love the photo guided steps. Makes tying paracord fun and not complicated.  Would recommend to anyone interested in paracord crafts to purchase the book.
B001JIES4Q|4.0|Around the holidays, everyone has their christmas movies they watch (Charlie Brown Christmas, A Christmas Story, It's A Wonderful Life, Elf, etc.). This movie is worth entering that rotation.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Probably the worst Denzel Washington movie I have ever seen.  It really was depressing and not what I was expecting.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I liked what Manny did with the electric power.<br />I would've dun that to<br />That is a awesome book<br />Love it!
0500289077|4.0|You can have a global vision of today street shots, i'm enjoying it a lot, and i think it will have a impact on my photography.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Requires WAY too much room and runs slow. Really pathetic and runs way better in browser. Seriously, don't bother with it.
B00BHMF578|4.0|I'm OK with the loose treatment of the facts of the actual event.  Affleck's direction of the reluctant hostage and the hangtime of the phone call from the airport to Hollywood were keys to the stress level.
B00138KISM|5.0|Yes, it's a bit over-produced.  It was the late 80s so that is understandable.  Once you get past the obligatory pop/rock single material, there are some great deep tracks here.
B004WMKXWM|1.0|Helter skelter visual effects piece.  Voices almost unintelligible and overwhelmed by background noise.  A great disappointment.  Part 2 was no better, even on DVD.
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|I have been a Bowie Fan all my life.. Been waiting since January for this one.... One of the best.. Downloaded it this morning..Been playing it since...Awesome
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|We watched 15 minutes and couldn't stomach anymore.  What a terrible treatment of the novel!!  Costumes were very well done.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There are no words. Just a beautiful story about what it means to live and love fully. Just read it. A second time even. Just do it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a really fun game. Easy at first then getting progressively more challenging. And the best part is you can play for free.
B004J4WNL2|2.0|As an introvert, I'm always looking for justification for my existence in a world of shock and awe, image without substance. My expectations with this book were misguided, as I hoped for sense of empowerment to stand up against the big noise and not feel victimized that I am a quiet individual in a loud, obnoxious world. Instead there is case study after case study of unknown people that to be honest, we care little about. A thin point is made and the author uses either personal experience and case studies to illustrate the point. To me it is a very boring read. I know it is on the best seller lists, but I am getting nothing out of it at all, and I can't even bring myself to finish reading it for I feel it is a waste of my time. Better to read Carl Jung to understand the introvert/extrovert divisions.
B008220DIC|5.0|I love this film but do not expect everyone to. It is very complicated and leaves many with a bad taste in their mouth, wondering what it was that they just experienced. Suggested for Paul Thomas Anderson fans and fans of challenging film in general.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|works great with the kindle fire hd.  nice size screen.  retains last calculation.  does all the basic math i need to do.  not complicated<br />and very easy to use
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This is an original novel in which a young writer moves to Guernsey and becomes a part of a community that is still healing from the aftermath of WWII. The characters are memorable and the setting captivates the reader.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Totally regretted investing the time to read this book only to be completely let down by the ending.  Felt cheated by the author.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is a highly readable novel with an interesting track. From law breaker to savior, Shantaram follows a winding path through an Indian slum town and touches the lives of rich and poor alike. Informative and insppirational.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Excellent family movie!!!  Entertaining and funny!!  Would watch it again and again...Great for all ages, watched it with my 11 and 5 year old boys.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I ran across this novel while comparing titles for one of my own novels. It is a fascinating story of a young man and his father and how a rare book links them together and to their local community. The novel is subtly written and holds one in the story from beginning to end.
B007SGM084|4.0|Odd book, but it is ok. Did not initially understand that it was a trilogy until after I got the first one.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My kids really enjoyed this movie. I think my husband laughed more than my 6 year old. Great movie for the whole family!
B0095P31L6|2.0|My husband and I both fell asleep.  It was a very strange movie.  My kid didn't really get it.  They did not wrap it up well...
B00B0ZT9NI|2.0|parts of video were unclear...  stopped and started a couple of times.  Loved the movie! Stopped enrollment because of the cost.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|A masterpiece by Shorter! Hes quartet is so very interesting. You can find new things for efery time you listen.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|This was a great remake with new music and great cast! I had a lot of fun watching it with the Wife!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Once I got started watching, couldn't stop. It is a great series. I can't wait to watch season 3. Hope there is a season 4.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Love the graphics, and I find it chalenging!  Puzzles and hidden objects are great!  Still working on it, but so far so good.
B002VBV1S6|4.0|A well written novel with a great pace and think through. Recommended for fiction readers looking for a light read, fast pace and interesting story twists
B008XBCJ34|5.0|We all love the movie - that doesn't need a review.  What I would like to review the 3D disk.<br /><br />We have a Sony 3D T.V. with the interactive glasses and have bought around 10 3D movies to watch here at home.  Some make my nauseous (mostly the cartoons) and the rest are OK.  Avatar blew them all out of the water....now this it how a 3D in-home movie experience should be!  I forgot my glasses were even on.  If you only buy one 3D movie - this would be the one to own.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was referred by a friend and absolutely loved it!! I am definitely rendering this to my friends and family!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put down this book! The storyline was suspenseful and romantic. A hard combination, but Sparks pulled it off. The ending was perfect, and definitely a surprise.
0823015033|5.0|The bottom line: This is THE book to learn how to sculpt figures, in polymer clay, or other mediums. Besides that, this is simply an awesome book on polymer clay, no matter what you are making.  You will not regret this purchase!<br /><br />On a longer note:  I have had the impression for a long time that many, if not most, artists (and sometimes chefs), want to give us enough to be satisfied, but don't give us everything, so we'll come back for their next book.  Case in point, Maureen C. Has given us &#34;... Clay Characters&#34;, and &#34;Family and Friends...&#34;, which are both decent tomes, but as my 15-year-old son noticed, there are missing steps.  We see how to shape the hands, how to cut the fingers, and how to shape the fingernails, but it's not clear what to do every step of the way.  Katherine Dewey has given us a real gift; a book that shows us ALL the steps, while also making the steps possible to achieve. So, I think if you're still treading here, it's time to get a hobby!  To put it more nicely; I think most of us want enough of a review to help us decide whether or not to make a purchase, but not an entire synopsis from cover to cover.  This book is in my top 5 favorite books on polymer clay, and my absolute favorite favorite book on sculpting figures.  Buy it, enjoy it, and maybe Katherine will gives us another volume on other areas of polymer clay, such as real animals, or fictional people and beasts!  Happy PCing - Andrew in OKC
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Imagine Prine and Dylan as unknowns......Rodriguez was unearthed as an ancient artifact which has overwhelmed today's music audiences around the world.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Buying Extra words, , parts, , etc.<br /><br />One of these games my grandkids were playing, gave them the option of buying more &#34;lives&#34;, etc. . . without using a password. They had charged over $35 of nothing before I realized they were able to do that. We have removed the offending game.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I have always loved the Thor storyline, and of course, I went and saw this in theaters. Since it released on prime, I've watched it more than a couple of times and it just gets better with each viewing. Marvel is doing a great job bringing the dated stories, that so many of us love from when we were kids, into the modern day.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this and want to see a great comic book movie, its worth the cost!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game!  I play it every day a few times a day.  Fun and chanllenging all at the same time!
0307730697|5.0|Reading Adam Brown's story made me with I could turn back the clock and go back into the service. Adam's story is inspiring in ways that I was surprised by. The journey from high school star to drug addict to one of the most elite of our fighting forces just knocked me over, and for it to be so clearly connected to God made it even more amazing.<br /><br />Blehm did a great job making it read like a story instead of an encyclopedia. Well done!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is awesome from start to finish....couldn't put it down! I would recommend this to all the love weary people of the world to give them hope.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I do not like how most action games come out when shrunk to fire size and swipe controls. REAL STEEL is about the only exception. This game is about as addictive as Mortal Combat was when I first got hooked at my University student union, and a lot more kid friendly. The graphics are great. The controls work well,which means great for touchscreen which is always sloppy. The only real problem is that it is a bit booring without the extra content. Treat yourself to everything and you will have one of the best fighters of all times. P.S.if you get this game Don't bother to see the movie. There's no difference.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful series!  Technically well done!  Fairly easy to find and download.  It is good to have a product that can be watched at my convenience.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is an amazing game I love it it reminds me of how much I love animals it's the best thing ever and if you like animals mostly horses than you will love this game my horse just like me !!!!!!!!!(:&lt;3
B00122FTVK|5.0|Alternative bands in general, have at least that one album that is very different from all the rest.  Where they try new things, or pay tribute the thing that they personally love.  This album is just that.  Much like what 'A Perfect Circle' did, this album really shows a very different side of the Deftones.  The Deftones style is still here, but they really push something different and some personal.  From acoustic versions of their previous songs, to songs from other artist that inspire the group.  They defiantly play around with sound on this album; from how the songs are recorded, to the instruments they choose to use.  Ya, this album in many way is like 'A Perfect Circle' &#34;Emotive&#34; album.  If you like that album, or if you like Deftones, this is a must have.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this battery meter as it gives me a better idea how much time I have to read vs surf the web.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|This album really goes further into the experimental side of the Deftones.  But like all their albums, the Deftones know who they are, and what they are about.  Therefore, never getting away from the sound and music that defines the Deftones.  With each album they refine their sound and music, but alway pushing for something a little different, exactly like another group that you might of heard of, Nine Inch Nails.  In this same regard, both groups take one step back, to take two steps forward; giving you something familiar (the style, sound, and music), that made you fall in love with them in the first place.  But giving you something new, that keeps you coming back for more.  In this regard, this album is that.  More of the same from the Deftones, but so good, and new, you just have to listen to experience what more this group can do.
0385349947|1.0|Ms. Sandberg doesn't do her business/equal opportunity credibility any good by writing this book and reviving male-bashing.  She just insulted half of her staff, and waved a flag that men are not going to get a fair shake under her management. What she needs to do is set a good example -- not paint all men with a broad brush, which is so Phil Donahue. American society has channels for righting wrongs, like face-to-face communication and the courts. If those are insufficient, run for public office.
B007UQ5Z1G|1.0|Anyone who was a fan of the original Linkin Park, don't even give this a chance.  They've dumbed down everything, drums are either electronic or when they're not, they're so simple and basic it sounds like a teenage garage band.  They just need to stop or go back to what they used to be, because I can't even classify them as even a rock band anymore.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I thought I would start at the beginning of the series after seeing the recent Reacher movie and I am glad I did. It made the opening scenes of the movie where Tom Cruise buys the clothes understandable.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Bought this watch for my father in law.  He seemed to really like it.  Good for those who do not like leather or metal bands.  Stylish and unique!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Teaches families to cope with the strong teenage emotion of love.  When teenagers are in love, that is all they live for and this<br />must be realized.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|Well built, but will not fit a phone over 2 3/8&#34;... my phone is almost 3&#34; wide, so I'll have to return it or start cutting off plastic and use a rubber-band.  The piece that holds the phone in place from the top is adjustable, but only extends to 2 3/8&#34;.  The IPhone 5 is 2.31&#34; so it should work OK... most other smartphones are larger... this would be an awesome product if they'd rethink the spring loaded piece that holds the top of the phone in place to extend another inch or so... that way it would really work on 'other cellphone(s)'
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Entertaining game.  Enjoyed the hidden object searches though the mini games were a bit lame.  Great graphics and good story line.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app! so easy to use and full of fun ideas and info to create or plan anything in one easy place! forget google I go to pinterest first!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I'm a bubble person.  I like it, and I'm glad I got it.  It's a good game to get to play while waiting in the outside waiting room, to be called.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I haven't completed the game yet, but I really enjoy playing this game. This one is on the top of my list. I especially enjoy solving puzzles.
0553801473|4.0|I love the series especially the first 3 books but this one was drawn out.  It's a great book tho it really gets better closer to the end n the last chapter is SWEET
B00B2166BS|5.0|I got my Nexus 10 Pogo Cable 2 days ahead of schedule. Looks and works great. This should be included with every new Nexus 10. I think it would be nicer if the cable was 6' instead of 4' but that's just a minor gripe. :)
B000JO9JHW|4.0|The main character is seriously deranged. It's compelling, but I don't know if I can say I &#34;like&#34; it. Have only watched the first episode - I do rather want to see the second just to see how things turn out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games I have played in awhile! I'm hooked!!!!!!!! Wish there were more games like this one, keep them coming. ;)
B008HK3XOU|4.0|It is almost perfect. Only problem I see is that in order to be able to plug it while the case is closed, the camera has to be towards the inside. This causes problems when using Skype because people see you in an angle from the bottom when you try to set the Kindle supported to use without hands. That is a horrible angle in most people! Another problem is that certain apps (like BBC News, npr news, and NBC news do not turn, so you need to turn the kindle from the normal position for me to open it (with my right hand since I am right handed) in order to be able to read the news. That, of course, is a problem with the apps, not with this case. A couple of holes on the spine would have solved these 2 problems.
1609611543|5.0|This book turned my whole way of eating around. After reading I had to give it a try. I didn't do it for weight as much as I did for overall health. Wheat causes inflammation in a lot of people. Would have never connected wheat to my arthritis without this book. After a few months of eating this way my husband jumped on board. His gallbladder had been inflamed for years and was nearing surgery to have it removed. Within a month his inflammation was gone and he has no more pain. This book lead me to the Paleo lifestyle that I am living now. Love eating this way. Would have never thought that all those healthy whole gains were doing so much damage to my body.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is the best book ever i absolutely loved it. I don't like reading but this is the best book by far the best. Now time for the second book.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|Some of the puzzles are tricky do to the touch screen workings. Tapping in a certain place doesn't always take. I played until I had to purchase and did purchase. To me it is worth $2.99. I purchase a lot of similiar computer games. It is nice having this type of game on my tablet. I have not noticed any problems except the slight ones because of the touch screen and it isn't often. I would recommend purchasing this game if you like these types of &quot; adventures&quot;! I do, so I did!
B0045HCIYA|5.0|First off love this movie! It came within two days, dvd was perfectly in tact, looked like I purchased it at the stores. Looking to buy more dvds because I had an awesome experience with this one!
0385349947|5.0|For too long in this white male dominated society we've been told that women don't belong in the workplace and that they're too emotional and catty to get anything done! Well no MORE! Do you hear me! ?<br /><br />Finally Sheryl has the courage and the integrity to cast off the bonds of her white male oppressors and live and breathe and grasp! I am so tired of Wall Street and Silicon Valley saying that women are unreliable and cannot do the same work that a 50-something white male can do. Huh? Are you kidding me? White males are no better than any of us! That might even be worse if you ask me.<br /><br />This isn't about your ego, white male! This is about who can do the things that need to be done! Women can do things and they can do things well! Sometimes better than men, sometimes not, that's more of an individual thing BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT!<br /><br />\\"Lean In\\" is saying (for the first time) that women are not the lesser gender and that the reign of these fat cat white male fascists is OVER!<br /><br />All I'm saying is that in all my research (and I've done the reading, so zip it up naysayers) women are the better gender about 50% of the time, sometimes less sometimes more depending on the reading.
B006RXPUR2|4.0|I love movies about my native New England. I had never seen a movie with Casey Afflect in it, and was impressed with his acting .
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love love love this show! Can't wait to see what happens next. Streaming was extremely easy and fast. Will definitely continue to watch!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|There are maybe a couple of songs on the album I'm not crazy about (Goin to the Party and Heartbreaker), but you can't have everything. And this album very nearly has everything. Lyrical depth, melodies, soul, and Earth-shaking rock. Most every track is a symposium on raw emotional songwriting. Brittany Howard has her voice as a songwriter, and it's just as spectacular as the one that comes out of her mouth. The rest of the band is tight, too. I'm a novice drummer, and the beats this drummer throws down are as rhythmically tight as they are idiosyncratic. This rhythm section is one for the ages, and they are so young!<br /><br />I saw the Shakes live in early March, and we got a preview of some of their new stuff. It promises to be just as good as this one is. What's fun was seeing the interplay between the lead guitarist (Who provides many of the melodies) and Howard (who just flat out shreds). Listen for it on the album. Here is a young band that might not have the pro-level chops yet or be quite used to the spotlight, but they understand the SONG. And their chops are improving.<br /><br />I hope these guys are around for a very long time.
B0030B621W|5.0|A real sleeper hit. Even with out a body- the voice of Kevin Spacy stole the film. The story kept you guessing right up until the very end.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Brave is a great kids movie. It will keep your child's attention filled with action and it have a great lesson at the end.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|We just ordered the series after getting hooked by Season 1, so we're not far into Season 2 yet.  We enjoyed the &#34;History of the House&#34; segment that kicked off the series.
1608871452|3.0|I gave this book as a gift to a supernatural fan and she just loved it.  Not being a fan myself I didn't understand all of the props and referances.  However as a fan of other shows I could see that this was a great reference book for anyone interested in Supernatural.  buy it and enjoy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved every word ...I could not put the book down. Wish it would real to a degree. Thanks for writing this trilogy....
B0053O89YM|5.0|This has been a great series to watch, right up there with HOMELAND! Every episode has at least 1 or 2 surprises. Really like the casting of all of the characters. Can't wait for the next season!

0307341577|5.0|DARK PLACES was written by Gillian Flynn before she wrote her 2012 smash success GONE GIRL. Although the two books are different, DARK PLACES is every bit as good as GONE GIRL, and I encourage you to read it. It's a five-star book.<br /><br />This book begins with a declaration by one main character that will interest you right away. There's no wait of several pages or chapters here, no wondering whether you should give up after page 50.<br /><br />From there, you will learn, little by little, of an event 30 years ago. You think you see what happened until you see it from another main character's perspective. And every chapter divulges more and more information.<br /><br />I see in DARK PLACES as well as Flynn's other two books that she has a definite style. That is, all three of her books grab your attention on page 1 and tell the story from different points of view while going back and forth in time.<br /><br />DARK PLACES should have been the success that GONE GIRL is. Who knows why it wasn't; it really is that good. But I predict that it will be recognized more now when readers of GONE GIRL become curious, as I did, to read Flynn's other books.<br /><br />Please be glad I skimp on details. I don't tell you the story so you can discover it as you read the book. How can a thriller be thrilling or a mystery be mysterious otherwise?<br /><br />Thanks to readitforward.com for sending me this book.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I enjoyed this movie almost as much as I like watching Glee!  Quirky, funny, and interesting take on their interpretation of the songs.  Loved it.
1603427244|5.0|I am a beginning-intermediate knitter. I've always used one method to cast on (Long Tail) and one way to bind off (Slip-Stitch Crochet). These were the methods I learned from my mother. I didn't even know there were other ways until I saw this book in the library.<br /><br />So once I looked through the library copy I knew I had to have this for my personal library. I ordered the spiral-bound edition and love it.<br /><br />There are more ways to cast on and more ways to bind off than I'll probably ever use but it's nice having options.<br /><br />The spiral-bound book lies flat and the illustrations are very easy to read and use - even for me.<br /><br />This is a great little book for anyone's knitting library.
0385535147|4.0|I love John Grisham's writing style. Some books are better than others. If I was giving points for fun, \\"The Racketeer\\" would be towards the top of his book list.<br /><br />Most of his books have twists and turns but this is a super windy road, full of switchbacks and blind corners.<br /><br />I do have to say the storyline is a wee bit out there but I read fiction to be entertained, to be shocked, to laugh - and this book evoked all those responses in me.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|I guess I didn't know what to expect, but this movie simply wasn't funny at all.  Frankly, I only made it about half way through it before I turned it off.  It was that bad.
1616550414|4.0|This answers so many of the Zelda fan's dreams and I'm happy to say this was the book that kicked 50 Shades from the Amazon's number 1 spot on the Best Seller list, even now it's still ahead of it. At any rate!<br /><br />Historia is a whole collection of history, concept art, storyline and timelines that Zelda fans have been dreaming of for so long, over 25 years...seriously. It opens up with a section solely on Skyward Sword the newest installment to the series, and the rest of the book kind of refers back to it as well. Part of me knows this is kind of selling point for them but it's also because Skyward Sword is technically the 1st game on the timeline now, so there are a lot of cool little things that they connected to the others games to help tie them together. The concept art is really awesome and I'm happy the designers decided to actually keep their really old notes because it's neat seeing their processes to get to those final characters. The one problem I had with it, and I'm blaming this on the fact that I had to read it on a computer is that the wording in the concept pictures is too hard to read. But I'll simply count that as another reason to buy this.<br /><br />The timeline is exactly what we wanted. It explains the rather complicated timelines (since it splits into three) and gives you the basic storyline from one to the next, which some side info on characters, objects and places. I'm a bit sad there wasn't more to my favorite game, Link's Awakening, but since I never finished it the story of it made so much more sense. For something that they will admit came together by accident it's actually a pretty cool storyline for the world, and despite a few consistency errors it's pretty fluid. Some of it is a tad repetitive, but most people will not sit down and read this like a normal novel so I doubt that will be too much of an issue.<br /><br />I think that any hard-core Zelda fan would love to have this both as a great reference but also to pull back those memories of sitting in front of the NES or N64 for hours, chopping grass or rolling to get some where faster. It's a great addition to any gamer's collection.<br /><br />I received this from the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.those memories of sitting in front of the NES or N64 for hours, chopping grass or rolling to get some where faster.

B008Y73940|4.0|It was an enjoyable movie.  I would recommend it to others to watch.  The actors all worked well together.  That is it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its fun, but it could use some more proper horse terms. its really fun so far. and I love that its free.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|Once loaded it is a richer version of the standard fb for Kindle, but the time it takes to load is a big deterrent.
B000V63BEU|5.0|One of my favorite Bob Marley CDs The flow is crisp and refreshing. This is good music. Real music. One love..
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i enjoy this game but the problem that i have ia that is too hard to unlock other games if you unlock 1 game thats too hard then it takes forever to unlock the next game. each minigame is quite enjoyable though
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The episodes of the Walking Dead keep you wanting more!  Can't wait for the next episodes.  I'm glad they're offered on amazon.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|When I first heard of once upon a time I had no interest. I thought it would be another cheesy show with a simple plot line. But I gave in and frankly I was impressed. The characters are played so well and the story line very well done an different then the basic generic fantasy characters. Things with a twist are always better
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I hope they can write in some new great characters now that Sybil, Matthew, and Obrien are gone. I bought the season so at least I can watch them whenever I like.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|And the best part is that it's a true story (basically). I bought this one for a friend home recuperating and she loved it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great story of a great man. Found out about Chris' death while reading his book. RIP. Some of his stories are just amazing. It's a pitty we lost such a person.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The beginning of this movie is very boring and it is the same throughout the movie. A high note was the resurrection of the 007 car and the theme song. The constant reference to &#34;old&#34; people was unnecessary.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|This is a fantastic set. I think Plant has really refined his vocals. He is not as explosive as he was back in the day, but to me, he sounds more controlled and precise, as if each note is more deliberate. And I was surprised at how much power he still has. The band sounds awesome. Page has such a mastery of creating awesome tone. It just sounds fantastic. My favorites from the concert: No Quarter and Kashmir. Worth it for any Zeppelin fan!
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|I really enjoy the flow and ease of this album.  Toe tapping, head bobbing, and lyrically pleasing from track 1 to the end.  Ho Hey was their radio hit and the others didn't disappoint.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This actually turned oh to be better than I thought it was going to be. So far my only complaints are the game has glitches several times and it shouldnt be that hard to aquire peanuts. Since you have to spend peanuts on certain things, a lot of things actually, it should be easier to aquire them or at least offer a coin option. Oh and stop making quests that make you interact with facebook or twitter!
B007MCTTHY|5.0|This game is so much fun. It is a great way to pass the time plus it will keep you thinking.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like how it give u toturials on all sorts of things & I also like how there is so many recipes that are easy& that work as appitizers for a party. But pinterest is a REALLY good app
B005HSL626|5.0|No complaints it is a good app and it is a fun app to play no matter how old you are can have fun with this app
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Its just perfect it like the best app ever no complains at all its just perfect. This app is just amazing like I said no complains it is just perfect
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love how I can just add a playlist I want to wake up to and I can even add and even delete songs on that playlist that I didn't want to hear. You can even adjust the name of ever alarm. It is the perfect alarm!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I just love this app this is one of my favorites I love editing different pictures and I love making special birthday pictures for my family memebers and I also love all the different frames and decortative frames that there is to choose from. I think the clip art is really cool the only downside to this app is that I had a lot of differnet types of clip art and when I upgraded the app I couldn't get anymore and plus I lost all the ones I already had but besides that I have no problem with the app
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|The young man had a quest to excape the materialism of his parents, to have an adventure, to live free of the constraints of civilization. Heart took him many places. Ego taged along for the ride. Wisdom was left behind, and assumption got him in trouble. Head knowkedge and 'book learning' are not enough when heart knowledge and a relationship with ones surroundings is needed. or as some native people call it, a &#34;relationship with all things&#34;. Mother Nature is a great teacher, she provides much, but mistakes can and are costly, as our young adventureer found out. It is a stiring story. There are ups and downs, just like life. Launch out, but take wisdom with you.
B000UJCALI|5.0|Although Stephen King HATED this movie, it'll still scare the bejeezus out of you no matter how many times you've seen it. Luckily for Angelinos, artifacts from the film are currently on display at the Los  Angeles County Museum of Art along with film clips through mid 2013.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addicting. The only thing I don't like about this free edition is, of course, the ads. and, once you've completed all the levels...you're just done. how sad. :( I want to keep playing, but you have to get a new game. Anyway...if you like puzzles and brain teasers...you'll love this game.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I was very surprised at how easy it is to get the apps you need/want on here.<br />You shall not be dissapointed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book sooo moved me. It took unexpected turns and totally had me hooked.  I was not expected to get so involved.  But what should I expect after having read the Slammed series.  This book was amazing, emotionally draining, and I wouldn't change a thing about it!!!  AND that was the HOTTEST NON-KISS EVER!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm in love with Christian grey and I have to see what happens next! Love love love love love love
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A well-made piece -- better than almost all 'network' offerings.<br />Presents a good interpretation of the erosion of the British class divisions following WW I.<br />Also shows how some upper class families interacted with their servants, and respected them.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A very fun book about the crazy life of Allen, a 100 year old man who decides to climb out  the window of his old folks home on hi  birthday. In this wild story you learn about Allen's adventures during his ling life, his adventures after leaving the home, and his very important part in world events during the century he lived. Very fun but crazy!
B000FBFMFW|5.0|A coming of age story with magic and dragons. Robin Hobb is a great story teller and draws her characters very well.  You feel as if you truly know them and find yourself quite involved in their success or failure.  We could never stop as soon as we said we were going to.  You lose a lot of sleep if you read just before bedtime as you just read a little more and a little more.  How sad to have finished it!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This is a beautiful-looking movie, totally enjoyable by the whole family; cute characters and sweet story. You can't miss with this one.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|it was a great movie. Enjoyed watching very much. Would recomend to anyone who likes true story's that are AWESOME!
B002C4YYEU|2.0|I/we love this movie. The sound quality of the streaming video was HORRIBLE. There must be a problem with their compression program. I hope this is the last time I have this issue.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this read.  I was hooked on the story on page one, and did not want it to end.  I haven't seen the movie, and I hope I am not disappointed becaused I loved the characters in the book.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this game. This is a fun game for all ages. Rather your three or fifty three, this game will have you hooked.
0307913090|5.0|I just started this audio book and it already has me hooked.  I've heard a lot about this series and finally took the plunge.  Glad I did.  I received this book right away.  Very pleased!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I love hidden object games and this one does not disappoint it challenges you through out the game.it is for all ages an fun for everyone I give it a thumbs up
B003HARV3Y|4.0|You really like the charactor's, Uma is a great Madusa, and wait for the ending, while the credits are running, it is worth it. Some of the things are a little &#34;Warehouse 13&#34; and that was a plus for us. It was really kind of cool seeing the artifacts that were being used. It was for the younger people, but I still enjoyed the film, some of my generation people were in it also.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Love the picture find along with the story line!! The graphics and sound effects are cool. Creeper me out playing at night in the dark,
B0053O89WY|5.0|I already knew the episodes would be great, or I wouldn't have ordered the set, but the extras and interviews were just as fun.
B00AYHK7RU|5.0|\\"The Next day\\" is David Bowie's first album in ten years and aged 66, he shows no sign of losing his sense of adventure and style. The album cover is a throwback to his classic \\"Heroes\\", and the sound does that also while managing to sound forward looking at the same time.<br /><br />Opening the album with bombast is the Dance/Rock title track. \\"Dirty Boys\\" is a snarling sax-sprinkled Bluesy rocker.  Keeping things upbeat are the familiar-sounding \\"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\\", the ominous \\"If You Can See Me\\" with skittery beats, the bouncy \\"Dancing Out In Space\\", \\"How Does The Grass Grow\\", and the blistering \\"You Will Set The World On Fire\\".<br /><br />Everything else is midtempo or slow, from the lovely chugging \\"Love Is Lost\\" (my favourite), the tender ballad \\"Where Are We Now?\\" (which finds him in his crooning mode), \\"Valentine's day\\", \\"I'd rather Be High\\", the Bluesy \\"Boss Of Me\\", the cryptic \\"You Feel So Lonely You Could Die\\", and the eerie guitar-driven \\"Heat\\". \\"And I tell myself, I don't know who I am\\" he sings against brooding strings and guitar.<br /><br />It's almost like time never went by. It's great to have Bowie back.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it... could not put it down... finished it in a day.  Great story line... immediately read the second book, now I am impatiently waiting for the third one!!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|My husband was directed to this processor for an unexpected and low budget upgrade to his computer.  It seems to have the best performance of the quad cores for the most reasonable price.  So far, in conjunction with his affordable board, RAM, and graphics card, he is thrilled to be able to run all of his games at their highest specs.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|This does so much more than I thought it would!  I got it for my mother in law (a Harry Potter NUT) for Christmas expecting that it would basically only do volume up and down and channel up and down, but it does all kinds of stuff.  How fun!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the first book and couldn't wait to read the second and now I'm on the third.  Very enjoyable read.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Love all books by Vince Flynn.  He has become a favorite and this Mitch Rapp thriller was no exception.  The twists and turns and surprises kept me glued to my Kindle for most of the day and into the night...until I finished the book.  My only sadness is I have to wait now for another book by this exciting author.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I've been a fan of Tina Fey's for years, and when 30 Rock becomes the next Law & Order of syndication, I'll still be loving and watching that show.  But Tina as an author, who knew?!  This book is great. No, its uber-great!  If you appreciate clever, articulate, well-structured writing that also surprises you with incredibly hysterical word play that seriously, makes you laugh out loud in public, then this is the book for you.  So now I have to add her writing to my list of things-I-love-about-Tina-Fey.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This item came in perfect condition.  Nice packaging.  It is the movie that finalizes the &#34;Fire Fly&#34; TV series.  I really enjoyed it.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I was gripped from beginning to end.  It puts into words an overwhelming mother's love and what sacrifices she would make for her children.

B000FC1AGG|5.0|Easy book to get through if you are in the mood for some light hearted funny reading. Great for vacations or on the plane
B00BHMETKC|3.0|The movie needed a stand out performance. a character the drew you into the tense drama of it all.... It seemed flat and drab.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|I enjoy the gameplay and the mechanisms used for adding difficulty. Nice game. I will come back to it from time to time.
B008M0UTRO|4.0|This is a very nice family film. The DVD has Japanese, Cantonese and Mandarin audio tracks.  It has subtitles in Chinese, English and Bahasa M'Asia. It was imported from Malaysia.  It played well on a Region 1 DVD player.  So It is possibly an all Regions (Region 0) copy.  It was rated (U) or (UMUM), the Malaysian equivalent of a (G) rating.  The protagonists are two Japanese high school students in the early 1960's.  They are trying to save the building where most of their high school clubs meet.  The building's interior is reminiscent of a cluttered version of the bathhouse of Miyazaki's Spirited Away.  There is a subplot of boy meets girl, but it gets complicated when they share copies of a photograph of three men.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Great watch, love the look, and feel, the automatic mechanism is nice and works well. The dial is particularly nice with the minutes and hours clearly visible, and it looks hot glowing in the dark.

1590200918|4.0|An enjoyable story within a story within a story; there are four narrators embedded within each other. Don't let that throw you off; this is one of those horror stories that makes you tense and nervous without blood or grime. It is the reader's imagination that provides the horror behind the loss and the mysteriously-powered painting. A concise, quick-read novella, the author of the Woman in Black has created a tight tale, an old-fashioned horror/ghost story that is a real pleasure to read and makes fear and literary anxiety fun.
1468179993|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3E4HHAYIRYWC2]]Are you afraid of public speaking? I was, until I read this book.<br /><br />You see, I'm a writer. I like to write. I like sitting alone at home in a t-shirt and yoga pants with just my characters for company.<br /><br />But writers have to sell books, and I hate the marketing part of it. Don't get me wrong: I adore my readers! But I don't want to be the kind of writer who goes on Twitter and shouts, \\"Buy my book!\\" I want the readers who want to read my books to read them because they want to read them. And then there's the whole t-shirt and yoga pants thing when it comes to author visits, vlogging, or making YouTube videos. No one wants to see that. And I'm embarrassed about the way I look, because I'm no Anne Hathaway, and I'm embarrassed by the way my voice sounds.<br /><br />So what do you do in a situation like that? How do you get over your fear of putting yourself out in public?<br /><br />Well, being a writer, the first thing I did was look to books for the answer. I bought Video Nation by Jefferson Graham, which is a book about creating video for the web. That turned out to be pointless, because its answer for everything is to spend hundreds and thousands of dollars on equipment. A friend recommended Talk Up Your Book by Patricia Fry, and I knew within the first few pages that was the wrong book for me, because it claims that personality sells over 80% of books. Hello, how many bestselling books have you bought from authors you've personally met? Have you met J.K. Rowling? How about James Patterson? Rick Riordan? I didn't think so. And her answer for what you do if you feel self-conscious about your weight is to lose weight. Really? Many anorexics think they're fat. So is that book saying they should lose weight? Kind of bad advice, don't you think?<br /><br />So then I finally got to How to Deliver a TED Talk by Jeremy Donavan, and this book is everything a great TED Talk should be: clear, concise, easy to follow, and inspirational. This isn't just the best book on public speaking I've ever read: it's the best nonfiction book I've ever read. They say if you give a man a fish he'll eat for a day, but if you teach a man to fish he'll feed himself and his family for a lifetime. This book is the ultimate TED Talk, because it uses the TED format to teach you how to inspire others with your own ideas worth spreading.<br /><br />The video review I've posted here is the first one I've made where I'm talking to the camera without feeling self-conscious because of the way I look and the way my voice sounds. Is it great? No. But I know the more I practice, the better I'll get. It's just a small step, but it's a giant leap for me. And I feel a lot better knowing it's not about selling anything. It's about sharing ideas that will improve lives. That's exactly why I write!<br /><br />So thank you, thank you, thank you, Jeremy Donovan, for helping me get over my fear.<br /><br />And for anyone who is afraid of public speaking, buy this book! You'll be so happy that you did.nal. This isn't just the best book on public speaking I've ever read: it's the best nonfiction book I've ever read.

B007QDNKQA|5.0|Watch this movie when you can watch it end-to-end. The story line is simple enough, although the movie grabs your interest from the beginning ... beware ... lots of bullets ripping through bodies, lots of bombs, car and even helicopter crashes (perfect guy movie). Sorry ladies, not much of a romance, although he does get his dead buddy's girl ... she was kinda a bit too easy actually. Guess that's what happens when &#34;patch&#34; up bullet holes in a stud.
B00B23O96A|3.0|Take \\"Old Sock\\", the latest release from Eric Clapton for what it is, a cover album.  Containing nearly 54 minutes of comfortable music, much that has been covered over the past couple of decades.  Yet, for those seeking to kick back and take the day slowly, Old Sock serves up a rich treat.<br /><br />A veteran in the music industry, Clapton has created solid new arrangements of classic tunes, all performed with a band that consists of many greats at times including Taj Mahal, JJ Cale, Steve Winwood , Paul McCartney and Chaka Khan. But, don't expect tons of guitar solos, as Old Sock showcases Clapton's rich singing instead.  The album is somewhat carefully constructed and is a very \\"pleasant\\" listen ... and that is mostly it, pleasant.<br /><br />For audio enthusiasts, this album is excellent.  The clarity and balance of the mix are top notch and demonstrate what a well recorded album actually sounds like.  The bass guitar is smooth and has the fullness one would expect from a concert setting, yet it doesn't over power the other instruments.  While much of the soundstage is centered, there is some spread to the left and right channels, providing some space within the overall mix.  Clapton's guitar has a slinky sound that is a real throwback to his first solo album \\"Eric Clapton.\\"  Both lead and backing vocals are spot on and natural with little treatment.  Rhythm and drums carry each song with the perfection of an aged wine.<br /><br />While I picked up the compact disc version of this release, vinyl lovers will be pleased to know that a high quality pressing is available.  Simply put, had the music been of higher caliber, I would likely have shelled out the extra bucks for what is likely the better quality version of this release.<br /><br />Recommended for serious fans of Clapton and listeners who enjoy high quality recordings.  Casual fans, and listeners who yearn for guitar licks should probably give this one a pass.<br />= Mediaversal

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I first heard about this book on Seventeen magazine and couldn't wait too read  it. So I pre ordered it and didn't regret it. I'm sixteen now and I love that I can relate to Eleanor and Park.  I was emotionally into it and couldn't put it down.  Whenever I did,  I always wondered what would happen next. Is such a great book and I recommend all teenagers to read it. All the characters were true to themselves and it was worth the buy.
B004H83IFA|5.0|This is a fantastic story of a tragic event. I highly recommend the special features where the real people involved are interviewed and tell the inside story of what happened. Fascinating.

B00AB0Z88S|4.0|I knew it would be another 3D lie movie right off the bat when the Proboscis monkey gave the ol' nosewhip not really in 3D. Then was followed by a hummingbird that was supposed to be in true 3D fluttering around in front of the screen. The 3D was second rate. The action sequences on almost every occasion were not in 3D when it was crucial they be in 3D. The tiger's attitude, nasty and hostile was/were never captured in 3D. The whale rising out of the waters was not in 3D.<br /><br />The story in the opening was well done, In parts witty and clever as hell. But overall this movie is stupid and dumb. Pi is short Piscine Molitor Tamel. Piscine Molitor is a swimming pool in Paris. Pi was named after a swimming pool. Gerard Depardieu in the script for like 60 seconds. I am a big fan of his. Gerard Depardieu was like the 3D, fleeting.<br /><br />3D people care about 3D not necessarily good filmmaking.. Am disappointed in this film. I spent a lot for this 3D version and got not much 3D in return. If you like 3D don't buy this movie. Silent Hill 3D is good 3D something the Life of PI doesn't have. 3D amnesia, more at a 3D rip-off and misleading their customers.<br /><br />Porn 3D is light years better. One can buy a 3D video camera for under $150.oo from Amazon and elsewhere.<br /><br />Wikepedia anaglyph 3D to see how much better 3D was over a century ago. These film makers are nothing but liars and cheats. There should be legal class action taken against them for deliberately lying about 3D.
B004EJ2QG4|4.0|Tavernier's director's cut is far superior to the original Image US release,<br />which was diced & pruned down to 102 minutes by his studio, much to Tavernier's dismay.<br />This is his attempt--look for 112 or 117 minute European versions--to deliver the film he thought he had made.<br />And he makes interesting, fluent, coherent movies--and the \\"Directors Edition\\" is all of those things.<br />It's not as resonant as the greatest of Tavernier's work, but at least the longer version<br />is far more coherent--and more obviously a Tavernier movie.<br />DVDbeaver can be useful here.

1439156816|5.0|I just got this in the mail, and began reading it today. So far I have to say this book has been insightful on Mr. King's life and creating his work. I didn't expect so many personal details, but it was also because he chose to share this with us, that I am both in awe and can relate to the book better.<br /><br />I may try to update this review more after I read the fully and have had a chance to absorb more details. I didn't buy it for the insight to his life but to help my writing improve.

B004ZMWUCU|2.0|Wow, this was....not interesting at all.  I read many different novels and genres, and this sounded promising, but I just could not get beyond the beginning of the book.  There was no empathy to be found for the main characters and I will admit that I gave up.  Perhaps there is a reason why he was misremembered?

0439023491|5.0|What is the Quarter Quell? I read Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins. It has many different genres which are adventure, series, science fiction, and fantasy. I suggest this book for anyone who likes drama and violence and also fifth through eighth grade. It is about a girl named Katniss Everdeen and a boy named Peeta Melmark. This story is in Panem, present day North America. In Catching Fire, Katniss and Peeta are chosen again from their district to compete in the 75th Hunger Games. What they do in the games changes their lives. Suzanne Collins also has written The Hunger Games; book one of this series and Mockingjay, book three of this series. She also has written the Gregor the Overlander series. The theme of Catching Fire is protect the people you love, no matter what you do. Even though this book is outstanding, I wish they would not have to fight to the death in the wild for entertainment. Glad you're here, and not there. My favorite part was when they started the games. You should really read this book, it is very exciting. When you finish the book, you will find out what the Quarter Quell is and how it affects the games.

B0052AC8C6|5.0|Intelligent, fun, unique and thoroughly entertaining.  Hadn't heard much about this flick before we watched it, but we were pleasantly surprised.  We're a bit low on sleep since we have a newborn but we didn't have any trouble staying awake during the movie.  We particularly enjoyed the writer's imaginative plot, characters, and use of higher level vocabulary.<br /><br />Definitely recommend watching this with your teenagers or even your adult friends!  We think you'll enjoy sharing in Rango's challenges and triumphs.
B005LAII80|2.0|Well, It was okay. Love the actor that played Dredd, but wasn't too crazy about the plot of this one.  Didn't make a lot of sense, but action parts was good!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Can be very challenging, but in all the good ways! A classic use-your-brain puzzle game, love it! And best of all, it's free!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Wow, this was great, surprised it didn't do well in the theaters. The ending was crazy good.  Have watched it a few times and will probably watch again this weekend!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel has never failed to deliver a magnificent performance in my opinion and this one is no different. His acting was superb but, also 'Flight' is a great story for a great actor. Contain's many trivial scenes and also many chilling scenes brought on by Denzel's character that gave me goosebumps! The movie contain's many reference's that support the belief in God which may disappoint some who are atheist or any other non-god believer's and there is a silly part with a woman who strangely repeat's the phrase 'PRAISE JESUS' twice in a zombie-like manner but, hey it's just a movie. Watch this movie... I don't think you'll be disappointed!

B009CGYO0K|1.0|I really wanted this book and was very excited to see it is finally on the Kindle. Sadly it is NOT available for people with Kindle Paper Whites... Will it ever be? Also that should be in BIGGER print so people can actually see that so they do not accidentally buy it. Honestly I skipped the area where it was because I did not see it and I know people have worse eye sight than me. just a suggestion.

B000TJBNFI|5.0|I had almost forgotten how much I enjoyed this movie when it first appeared. Kathy Bates gave a phenomenal performance, enough so that I think James Caan might still have nightmares about it. I don't know what special features were included on earlier editions, but the Collector's Edition has some very interesting interviews. (Oh... and thanks to Stephen King for sharing Misery with the world.)
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This version of temple run is more challenging with better graphics and this time you are being chased by only 1 giant HUGE undead monkey thing, you get to slide down ropes jump over streams.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Being 62 years old and a man somehow didn't seem to affect the great enjoyment I received from reading this novel. Maybe it's because I still enjoy stringing my bow and heading off into the woods for the peace and quiet it affords along with the occasional squirrel for the pot. I wonder if the young girls who read this might just take up archery and find out how completely captivating it can become?

0143116177|5.0|A history of the emergence of money and all related instruments, from credit to bonds and shares as well as the entities that operate them, banks, stock markets and insurance companies. There is also talk of the real estate and mortgage related. Everything is here clearly explained in clear, simple, and fun, as they write the author. Book should be required reading for every citizen living in the world today.
B00AUU2KI0|5.0|An amazing story.  I started reading this book only because I wanted to see the movie and I knew the movie would leave out parts that I found interesting.  What I found while reading this is a wonderful story of survival that captivated me with every turning of the page.  I did not expect to like it as much as I did.  The story started off slow explaining the life living at a zoo in India, but once Pi started exploring his spiritual side, the story picked up quickly.  Great book for discussions among reading groups or just with friends.  This book will make you think of how you would react in a similar situation.  The will to survive is an unbelievable strength and I believe that this story gives a glimpse of what it's like just to try live one more day.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed this book . At first I wasn't sure. Stick with it and it is enjoyable and a quick read
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who has been told to &#34;come out of her shell&#34;, who has had something to say in a group, but left it unsaid, and to anyone who worries about a child who seems shy.

1606863622|2.0|While this is the first (and last) Nicholas Sparks book I've ever read, I wasn't a complete stranger to his works, having previously seen the movie adaptations of \\"A Walk To Remember\\" and \\"The Notebook.\\"  I found both of those movies to be rather emotionally overwrought and sappier than sappy, but I figured that could always be due to decisions on the part of the director.  Maybe the books were better, I figured.  And while I don't normally read this sort of genre, someone had insisted I HAD to read this book, so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />I'll be bluntly honest -- I hate it.  Not just because it's not my type of book, but because by the time I turned the last page I felt emotionally wrung out, with precious little reward.<br /><br />\\"Dear John\\" is about -- wait for it -- John, a former teenage rebel turned Army soldier, who's back home in North Carolina for a furlough.  He meets Savannah, a Habitat for Humanity volunteer, and the two fall in love almost at first sight.  Savannah vows to wait for him while he serves his tour of duty... but after 9/11 happens, he stays in the military, and time and distance take their toll on the relationship until finally she decides to marry someone else.  Years later John returns home to find Savannah's life in crisis, and he has to make a decision on how best to help her...<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks is not a bad writer, but I HATE how he manipulates the reader's emotions.  He seems bound and determined to make his characters suffer, but portrays it as a \\"noble\\" sort of suffering -- the crises are all neat and tidy, easily taken care of with an anonymous monetary donation or a pat on the back.  And he tantalizes us with possible happy endings, only to yank them out under our feet.  There's nothing wrong with a bittersweet ending, but the route he takes to get there leaves me feeling like he's been jerking on my heartstrings the whole way, until I feel nothing but numb and uncaring when we finally get to said ending.<br /><br />Also, the author tries to shoehorn in a subplot about John's high-functioning autistic father.  Had said father had a greater impact on the story, I might have liked this, as autism runs in our family.  But it felt like a last-minute addition to the book, and did little to impact the story.  It might as well have not been there.<br /><br />I'm also getting tired of authors using 9/11 as a plot device when it's not really necessary.  There were better ways to keep the lovers separated than 9/11 -- have a little respect for a tragedy, people, and leave it out of your weepy romance story.<br /><br />All in all, this book feels like a gloppy, saccharine mess.  It feels like a sugar-coated Hallmark movie, putting the reader on an emotional roller-coaster until they reach the end too exhausted to care about the characters.  I don't mind a book that evokes a real emotional response, but it feels like \\"Dear John\\" used all kinds of underhanded tricks to get a response from me, and then had the bad grace to leave me with an unfulfilling ending.  Ick.<br /><br />Sorry, Sparks, but no more please.  I'm done with your books.Also, the author tries to shoehorn in a subplot about John's high-functioning autistic father.  Had said father had a greater impact on the story, I might have liked this, as autism runs in our family.  But it felt like a last-minute addition to the book, and did little to impact the story.  It might as well have not been there.<br /><br />I'm also getting tired of authors using 9/11 as a plot device when it's not really necessary.  There were better ways to keep the lovers separated than 9/11 -- have a little respect for a tragedy, people, and leave it out of your weepy romance story.<br /><br />All in all, this book feels like a gloppy, saccharine mess.  It feels like a sugar-coated Hallmark movie, putting the reader on an emotional roller-coaster until they reach the end too exhausted to care about the characters.  I don't mind a book that evokes a real emotional response, but it feels like \\"Dear John\\" used all kinds of underhanded tricks to get a response from me, and then had the bad grace to leave me with an unfulfilling ending.  Ick.<br /><br />Sorry, Sparks, but no more please.  I'm done with your books.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Excellent film for the ones who love some action along with great drama.  Great storyline and Denzel's performance was top notch.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I thought the game would be boring but I was wrong. I deleted it and then I decided to bring it back
B0067R0APK|4.0|The free version of this application is a decent product, and the ads aren't hideously intrusive. But once they were gone, this became the best weather app I've used.<br /><br />Optionally captures NWS alerts in your (selectable) home location and displays temperature in notification bar. Permits addition of other locations which are easily accessible through a simple drop down. Provides a good variety of current and forecast conditions.<br /><br />\\"Real Feel\\" temperature is shown as alternative to wind chill/heat index...a little gimmicky.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Regarding review title: I haven't played many games that really immersed me to the point of being scary. I remember the \\"Phantasmagoria\\" PC game a long time ago, that was also pretty scary but this is scary in a different way (that was macabre scary, this is creepy atmosphere, no idea what's going on, suspense building music, progressively more appearances by the Slenderman - first off in the distance then getting in your face big time and suddenly).<br /><br />I had never heard of the Slenderman until I looked him up on wikipedia after getting this game. So my review does not reflect any previous affection for the related lore.<br /><br />The premise and goals of the game are quite simple. If you can suspend disbelief and immerse yourself in what you are experiencing I predict you will find it scary as I did. If you remain detached while playing it, I doubt it will seem scary as some other viewers mentioned. You could use your past experiences watching suspenseful movies as a guide to how you will react and whether or not the game will work for you. Playing the game in a distraction free environment, ideally at night and in the dark, will help.<br /><br />I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't think the second farm scenario was as interesting as the first road scenario and because several times I \\"fell through\\" a \\"hole\\" in the game environment due to a glitch and needed to restart the game (this was on an Android phone, not the Kindle Fire). I've only attempted the farm scenario once so I will try it again.<br /><br />I got this for free, but I think it is worth the $0.99 if you compare it to other forms of entertainment. You should get a few fun evenings out of it.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best and I wa.t to play it forever and never stop. this is better then flow free that was a good game but this game is better then that game!!! I cant belive it was free I was so happy
1439156816|5.0|This book was on a list of 12 suggested by Bryan Garner. It turned out to be the best book on that list, which included some other great books and a few stinkers (for example, one of those 12 was Lamott's Bird by Bird which was probably the worst book I've ever read).<br /><br />This one was actually one of the most enjoyable reads I can remember. And I did not expect that at all. I just wanted to read all 12 of those books. The note that this book hits is authenticity. The reader gets an immediate connection to the ideas presented. I hope Stephen King writes more nonfiction, maybe in the Bill Bryson mode -- that would be great!
B00447G2PM|5.0|lHi Folks,<br />This is a great film for those of you who want to experience 3D for the Family. IMAX is the very best and the scenes are stunning. Ocean life is beautiful you feel like you a scuba diving and right there in the picture.<br /><br />If this is your first 3D experience it will blow you out of your shoes. Quite frankly I own several 3D films with the latest being The Avenger's from last year. The Ocean based 3D films are a great learning tool for children. I suggest that parents watch these types of films with their children to explain some of the scenes to them. Anyway at least to this point I haven't found a 3D that I haven't enjoyed immensely.<br />Hope this helps.<br />Blessings,<br />Phil
B0042J6VUS|5.0|The phone holder alone is worth the $3 - it securely holds my iPhone even with when it's in its case case - what I will use it most for will be as holder to set my phone on a table, counter top, etc - works well for that purpose as long as the surface is smooth and flat -<br /><br />The tripod doesn't impress me - with the legs retracted, they don't 'spread' enough to provide a stable support for the phone - I didn't try it with the legs extended - I put the holder on a Gorillapod and the pair make an excellent support for my iPhone 4 - the holder accepts a 'standard' 1/4-20 tripod screw - not sure why anyone would want to do it, but a phone could be mounted on any tripod -
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Hi Folks,<br />I love this movie and played it a dozen times or more.  It is Blu-ray visually awesome and combines the game we played as kids Hasbro's Battleship.<br />The action and special effects are grate if you like the Navy and ships with nonstop action you will love it like me.<br />If you visit Hawaii and Pearl Harbor and have a chance to see the Mighty MO the USS Missouri you will never forget being on that historic Ship that plays such a pivotal role in saving the day and the planet from invading aliens.<br />Hope this helps.<br />Blessings,<br />Phil
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love the application and its versatility to use on devices and desktop....also love that I can share notebooks with othets
B004U8VWLE|1.0|I love ballet but this was rather a horror movie. It makes ballet dancers look vicious and perverted. This is not what I expected at all. The story about her transforming into the black swan was difficult to follow as well because it confuses reality with hallucination.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Excellent easy to use calculator app. Very pleased with the way it has been set up... especially being able to see the numbers previously entered. Highly recommended!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun. The graphics are very realistic, and it is cool that you can send gifts to other people.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this is a fun game and it is a great app for horse lovers. I think u should get it.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I got so hooked on this book I ended up reading it entirely in one sitting. It was a good read.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|My husband very much wanted to see this movie.  I thought it looked pretty stupid, but I decided to watch it with him anyway.  It was actually pretty enjoyable.  Not too goofy, not too gory.  There are funny parts and the acting is much, much better than expected.  Give it a shot, even if you are skeptical.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves playing. It's simple but keeps her entertained.<br />She really wants a real horse and this is close enough.
B005LF9OCE|2.0|For the love of all that is holy, when are we ever going to meet the friggin' Mom?!?!  As the seasons rack up, this show gets less and less funny, and less and less enjoyable.  It's too bad since the cast is so lovable.  They should have stopped the show a season ago.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|best app ever. I love how it tells me how long I have to listen to music depending on my batteries health. overall best app ever at a great price... free
B003V9J6R0|2.0|I should have expected that music that was originally recorded digitally could not be worthy of vinyl. it's nice to have the big album art, but it would really be nice if music was recorded like it used to be.
037582913X|5.0|I got this book for my daughter (18mos. old) This was one of my favorite books as a child and now she loves it too. It is also a big little golden book, which is how I remember it as a child. Totally worth it!
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|simply put. This app is just AWSOME. I can finally turn up my bass when I want or need to.
B008OOYALE|5.0|my son and I really injoy this game. we have spent no money yet we are building a wonderful world. this game is slow but worth the time.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I am hoping a new book will be released soon. Still too many unanswered questions about characters and the future of the realm!
0679411585|5.0|A nonfiction type book with the real life stories of a fiction book. Heart touching and difficult to read in many areas as due to story content of war life and death. When you get to the last page, you'll say it's one of the most touching war stories you've ever read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it time flys  when playing this game. u have to try it its a great to play when killling time.
B0031RS4UM|3.0|Although the book was a good read, it started well but got lost in the tedious journey through  to their destination. The last quarter of the book improved in pace and suspense. Not one of his better books.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|I thought because it was so inexpensive that it was going to be kind of crappy, but it was a great fit for my Canon 7D. It definitely reduces shakiness but you still need to have a steady hand. I'm pleased.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I love this movie when I finish my vacation I went to see it and went the DVD went out I pre order I love it
160459201X|5.0|There are a lot of amazing suggestions in this book that I really believe in. I'm so happy that I made the purchase, it really motivates you to believe in the power of your mind both conscious and unconscious.
B00ARAO720|5.0|I wanted to see this movie before I went on vacation I love it that why I brought the movie.is very good I love it
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Good product so far (3 months). Charges quickly, and the coiled cord is handy to keep things neat. Don't waste your money on the imitation stuff.
B008AT71WI|5.0|I was looking this movie for my brother and every store was sold out when I enter amazon I finally found it it make my brother smile on Christmas
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I really hope this story was solely for entertainment.  No pilot or air crew member should be as intoxicated as Whip.  The story is presented in a very good way despite the unlikelihood of such an occurrence.  The challenges presented to this semi-heroic pilot following his landing were too easy for him to manage but the ending where he is speaking to fellow inmates made me enjoy the story at large.  View this yourself; write what you think when you're done.<br /><br />It's very worth the watch and the feedback.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My dad bought me this game but 2 kindles cant start a game try to fix it and me and my bro and bro and sis play together cause we can play with ipads
B003JTHXOK|5.0|An excellent story of running from an old life and starting life a new and falling in love with a new love.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed this trilogy tremendously.  It was a fun and interesting summertime read.  I wish there was a fourth one.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Wow it is fun addictive and has great controlled I would reccomend it for everyone who likes racing games and ya
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet;  If you are a big fan of soilwork's early music you might not find many redeeming qualities, but if you've prefered soilwork's evolution past A Predator's Portrait, this dual disc album will certainly impress you.  This release has more clean vocals than ever before, which presents a more pop-culture influence, but this coupled with excellent song structure, and tastefull complexity makes this an excellent listen.<br /><br />Also, with two disks and twenty songs you'll be hard pressed to find more than a couple songs that dont quite hit the ears right.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Content was listed as one of Time Magazine's \\"100 Best TV Shows of All-Time.\\". Enjoy it. Well, to hold DVDs it's better to buy a 40 Cd holder/case.. just to remain enjoyed!<br /><br />For international customers: maybe your DVD Player cannot see closed captions (subtitles are not available), however \\"closed captions\\" are video integrated so you still can see them running DVDs on PC/notebook software (MP, VLC, etc). It is true some DVD Players have the capability to handle closed captions, if you need them.<br />Note also that few DVDs in package are only Region Code 1.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like this app a lot! its great help when I need it and it is very handy when my parents are do int math :)  But if ur looking for something more complex not the app for you it has the basic + &divide; &times; - good app for school! :)
B007SGM084|5.0|Like most readers, I think I fell for Fifty! I found myself thinking of him even when I wasn't reading and any past relationships that rang true. I read all three books in a row staying up late just to keep going. I did find myself a tab bored about half way through the third book. It got slightly repetitive and predictable. But it came around and ended well.
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|Better than season 1, pretty good.I didn't read the books it's more of a transitional show for me. If you love this, you'll love it. If not, it's fair for an average watcher.
B005LAII80|5.0|Memorable characters, music, mood, visuals and special effects. Cleverly flushes out complex characters without revealing too much and yet makes them very real and highly likable. The action and violence is swift and stylized and there is just enough plot devices to keep things interesting regardless of it's simple premise. The cinematography is also a huge plus and is readily apparent in it's caliber. In short, I loved it. Believable, likable, and just plain bada**.
B0091V6TF4|4.0|Very fun cruising around with these memorable tunes.  A must for any Bond girl or guy. Just watch your speed.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|My gorgeous birthday present to me, I'm not sure which of these superb, poetical, powerful tracks is my favourite because I love them all and can't turn it off, they're in my head even when they're not in the machine. Just adore 21, highly, highly recommended; `Take It All' Adele must be the `One And Only'. Fabulous.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|My co-workers and I enjoy this game comparing how many elements we have.  Once you start you cannot stop. Great Fun
B000286RKW|5.0|Got this as a present for my friend who loves this movie anytime he sees it on tv we wind up watching it so as a special surprise i got this for him.  He loved it, its the small things that count and really knowing what someone likes
0345803485|1.0|This book is ridiculous I haven't even finished, but the way its written is ridiculous.  The way both of the main characters speak isn't very \\"American\\" or even sexy I've only read the first love scene and I found myself being turned on and quickly turned back off. The way Christian speaks in bed is too fake, I feel like he holds and so does the author. It ridiculous, its a love scene! Stop censoring yourself, she sounds almost too embarassed to say what there doing. It's all hype.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Now my kids know more about Greek mythology than I do!  Wish I could read them, but the kids would find out!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|inexpensive, little and light. folds up compactly, won't sharpen an axe or hatchet but keeps the camping/survival knife nice and keen.
B00000K3D4|5.0|My daughter loves this novie, since was a little child. So..i bought on dvd, because she has the videotape version.
B000008I5I|5.0|A must have for all fans of Bob Marley so inspirational and mellowed words from one of the best musicians of all time in my eyes
B003RUZKC8|5.0|Unadulterated double helpings of killing, action-packed fight scenes and heavy weapons seasoned with satisfying revenge and a twist of diabolical evil genius humor makes this a feel good exercise in annihilation!! The Losers are big Winners in this reviewers eyes and earned a well-deserved place in my collection,,,, buy it, pop the corn and enjoy this story of get even, senseless violent fun, I did, Oh and by the way Zoe Saldana makes this movie easy to watch as well, so just one more reason to give it a go!
B0063IH60K|5.0|good classic game to play while waiting to leave to go some where or waiting for kids to get out of school.
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|I thought the book was somewhat boring, and much of the description seemed unnecessary to the plot. The description of life in the orphanage was the only time I made any emotional connection.
B007REV4T8|5.0|The first Daniel Craig Bond movies I didn't care for at all. This one actually brought Bond back to life. I hope that they keep it up now.
B006OAB2XO|5.0|I discovered Grimes one day as I trolled through the many post on Metafilter. I noticed a headline describing how an artist, Grimes, managed to record her critically acclaimed album, Visions, using Mac's Garageband software application. Having used Garageband in the past, and loving it, I decided to take a listen to see what other artist were able to accomplish with it. The first song I heard was \\"Oblivion\\" and immediately I was impressed with the great quality of the mix and production of the song. Something else happened, I began to really like this strange and really hard to describe song. I left it at that. Next thing I know, \\"Oblivion\\" is just playing in my head and I cannot get the thought of it out. So I go back to her site and listen to \\"Oblivion\\" and then to \\"Genesis\\", and then to YouTube to hear other songs and watch performances.<br /><br />Not too long after that I made the purchase of the full album. It's really an incredible vision from a true artist in every sense of the word. In today's music, we have to make the distinction between performers and artist. Those that create and those who are like fine tuned athletes that are merely following a game plan given to them by a team of coaches and trainers. Grimes is a true artist. She wrote her music, scored it, performed it, produced it, and even packaged the album with her own original artwork. It is that expression, in totality, why this album to me is 5 star material.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|Not sure what I was expecting with this movie but the movie trailers sure led you astray on this movie.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|I mixture of catchy tunes and funky riffs make this CD an easy listen. Adam Levine and company have brought Maroon 5 back to the forefront of pop music with this latest entry.
B0029QRA1U|1.0|Mine died after two uses.  There's not much to review so this will be my shortest review ever.  You're better off with at tag sale record player from the 70s.  I'm not joking.
1878424505|4.0|So two Sundays ago I was watching Oprah's Super Soul Sunday and she had an interview with Don Miguel Ruiz about his book The Four Agreements.<br />I sat still and absorbed the interview and was amazed by this man and his profound words. My next step was to order 3 copies one for myself<br />and my two daughters. Finally the book arrived, I had it, it was mine. I sat and read that book all weekend and highlighted all the things<br />that applied to me (practically the entire book). It is a compact book, easy to carry with you everywhere that you go.<br />So while you are wondering what the four agreements are:<br /><br />Here goes!<br /><br />1. Be impeccable with your word.<br />2. Don't take anything personally (Yikes! I tend to).<br />3. Don't make assumptions.<br />4. Always do your best.<br /><br />This is just my opinion, everyone may not like this book but I did.<br />Some things I did not agree with but I took what could apply in my life.<br /><br />Roxanne Catherine Mapp
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Beautiful storytelling! I could not put the book down. The imagery that the author developed kept me intreagued throughout the book.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love (I spy) games and this one was awesome! Wish it was longer though but a good find it game for adults:)
B002VPE1WK|4.0|We received this bag as part of a special offer when we bought our new DSLR. I am not sure this is quite the bag we would have picked if it wasn't included in our purchase, but it definitely does the job. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is it is a little big. But on the bright side we can fit our DSLR, any necessary accessory as well as our video camera and accessories in this one bag. I could see if you had multiple lenses for your DSLR that this bag would be very convenient (so far we only have the one that came with the DSLR).
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What else could I possible rate this.  I'm hooked just like every other 20-something woman in the world.  I'm not a big fan of the writing style but who cares...This book changes lives!  hah!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Boring book dont waste your time to start the day. movies and superman returns to the fridge to get on my kindle and save the day. Toria and superman returns to the movie's
B00867GHS8|5.0|Although I have already seen this movie many many times before, I just had to get it on Bluray 3D just to see it again. This brings back the child in me. I love this movie because of how much detail there is with the characters and how some parts are so life like. This items came as fast as it could with one day prime shipping. Everything came intact without a hitch!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Enjoyable especially while waiting in car pool lane or doctors offices. I have always enjoyed this type of game at carnivals and fairs...now I can practice to see what I can win in real life! Lots of fun!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was a awesome game I liked it more than temple run it is a fun time I loved it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is perfect! I just got to playing it today and I can't put it down! Highly recommended for everyone of all ages. Great for killing time. Does drain battery but the graphics are beautiful and game play is pretty flawless.
B005LAIGSM|4.0|Maybe its because I have a weak spot for Rachel McAdams but I really enjoyed this movie. I know it's based on a true story, but I sat through the movie thinking this movie was like a very simplistic version of 'Random Harvest'. I find Channing Tatum very wooden as an actor, and the script was a bit simple, but I always enjoy Rachel's acting and her charm just in general.
B002OEBMN4|5.0|Really? It's Slayer. This band is one of, if not the best thrash bands ever to record music. Period. World Painted Blood is classic Slayer. The title track is awesome as is Snuff and Hate Worldwide. The production is way better than their early releases but all in all classic Slayer. Thank god  for over 30 years they have been solid. No other Big 4 band can say that. Metallica has sucked until Death Magnetic. Anthrax's newest is a beast too. You can pretty much buy any Slayer album and jump in. They all rule!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this app is so addicting and fun. every time I play I get farther than last time. this app is awesome. u should definently get it.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|This was a fun movie that I enjoyed watching with my granddaughters. A word of caution though, there are some scary moments that may frighten young children. The story is a good one about accepting those who are different - in this case \\"monsters\\" accepting a human.  It shows how we all have preconcieved notions whether obtained through what we've been taught or through past experiences. However, those notions can be wrong and we need to be open minded. It's a story about a father's love for his daughter and his desire to protect her especially when she wants to see the outside world and falls in love with a human. This is all done with humor and everyone learns something in the end. I would recommend this movie to anyone seeking a good laugh or who wants to share some movie time with their children or grandchildren.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|It's very fun and challenging! I think others would enjoy it as we'll! It's almost like Mario bros! Fun fun fun
B00633W614|4.0|I like what JA is doing with this series. There are a few details missing from the storyline in this book, however, that caused it to be a bit disjointed toward the last quarter of the book. Even with the holes this book was a pleasure to read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addicting fun game for free very fast paced just a very good game all around runs smooth get this game if it looking for a fun free game
B000031EGV|5.0|My daughter loves this movie so I bought it so our family could watch it together.  It arrived in great condtion.  Thank you
B008MAI0WK|5.0|Even if I were not especially inerested in the Pi, I would recommend this book for its logical & straightforward discussion of Linux system administration. It answered many Linux questions that have long perplexed me. High praise is also warranted for the simple, jargon free prose style employed.
B007REV4YI|5.0|One of the Best Bond movies in a while. BluRay,DVD,and digital copy. Must have if you like the Bond series..
0307352153|5.0|Susan Cain's book on introversion is, in my estimation, an indispensable resource on challenges introverts face in an extroverted world. The book is well researched and written. The five years it  Cain took to write is evident. I was surprised by the amount of research Quiet contained, and the extensive research serves as a testimony to a self-avowed introvert.<br /><br />Cain organized the book around  four main sections. Part One, the Extrovert Ideal, covers the cultural propensity toward extroversion. Part Two, Your Biology, Your Self! covers biological factors of introversion. Part Three, Do All Cultures have an Extrovert Ideal, explores other cultures and whether there are cultures that are more introverted. Part Four, How to Love, How To Work, gives guidance on how to live as an introvert in an extrovert's world.<br /><br />One of the main points Cain made was that introversion is not something to be cured or fixed. It is a temperament. She points out not only the contribution introverts have made, but how their temperament is essential to society. Introvert's quiet contributions have literally changed the world. Through many encouraging chapters she helps introverts to embrace their temperament, find their voice, and contribute. The book addresses how extroverted cultures create challenges that Introverts must understand and adapt to if they are going to reach their potential.<br /><br />The book was comprehensive, covering everything from biological factors to how to succeed in an extroverted world. She also addresses raising a child who may be an introvert. A wonderful take away was her suggestions on public speaking.<br /><br />The book is well researched, however, I wish the references to the endnotes were in the text. While not having references in the text, does make the book easier to read, it makes further research more difficult. Also, not having references in the text makes it difficult to know which statements had research and which ones didn't. That is my only critique however.<br /><br />This is an excellent book and resource for both introverts and extroverts. I recommend this book to those who know they are introverted because it gives suggestions and guidance on how to embrace one's introversion while living in an extroverted world. I recommend this book to those who work, or live, with introverts, and anyone who has to lead or manage people. Extroverted leaders and managers have much to gain through this book. By understanding more about the introverts, and their potential contributions, both introverts and extroverts will find their world enriched.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|i really like this app. the only problem i have with it is that it does not have fractions and advanced proceedures. i sm in pre alegebra snd i need fractions and things. but other than that...good app.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I enjoyed this game.  And I liked the mini game that came with it.  I played it some time ago; however, I remember that there were extras such as a mini game.  It was worth the small amount I spent on it.
B00A8KJN14|5.0|Such great fun.  Tim Burton has done it again!  Was such a laugh and the animation was so amazing!!  Love it!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote has been a great help at keeping everything in order at home and at work. No issues as of yet on my kindle fire. i strongly recomend this app.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this book. When I bought this book I was kinda expecting it to be another high school romance, which lets be honest, lacks in romance because it's high school how romantic can it get?! But I was wrong and completely thrown off by this book. It was good from the start and kept me  completely interested the whole way through.

143353083X|1.0|Ok, so maybe if I had done more research I would not have been deceived, but still, the only time you do research, generally, is if something in one of your experiences in life has given you a hint to think that going down a certain path may give you more salient information that will be necessary in coming to a conclusion. If you don't have this, you tend to act in a generally normal way. You tend to believe what you are experiencing is alike to what you have experienced previously. Well, this is not the case in this instance. I wanted to get the paperback because it was cheaper, and I don't really want to go to church or a Bible study with some fancy leather Bible, which sort of says, yes, I care about the poor, but I'll just let them see if they can find the cow this Bible was made of, and then they can eat that. Anyway, I wanted paperback. I saw nowhere, though it said personal size, where it talked about the print being smaller. I also didn't see where it said it didn't have everything the &#34;regular&#34; esv study bible had. I guess it was my mistake. Still it's lame. Do not buy this if you are thinking the type will be of regular size; and do not buy this if you think it is the &#34;regular&#34; esv, as it is not, because it does not contain some articles that are probably very useful. I just wish a paperback was a paperback was a paperback; that is how it is most times, and how it should be. If the type were regular, I probably wouldn't even say anything here, as I can go on the esv online and read the other articles, but I guess it's all for the best, because now I'm going to get the large print hardcover study bible. BEWARE!

B008VBYN80|1.0|Downloaded fine, went to open it and ran through the initial startup scene then froze. Had to completely shut down my Kindle to get out of it. Tried 3 times, same results. Deleted it. If you are going to take the time to make what looks like a good game there should be a way to make sure all the bugs are worked out before offering to the public. To much of this on here.

0395389496|5.0|With our grand kids in college, now I buy children's story books as much for the art as the story.  This book contains drop-dead gorgeous illustration. It rightfully earned the recognition it has received. It's in my bookcase along with my vet med and business books -- there for sheer visual bliss and a break from the more analytical parts of my life!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I had heard great things about this show, but it wasn't until I checked it out for myself that I was a believer.  I started with season 1 and worked my way through like i'd highly suggest anyone and everyone else do.  One of the best shows i've ever seen.  Top 5 for sure!
B0000029AP|3.0|When I first bought this Aerosmith in the Summer of 1975, I had already heard \\"Walk This Way\\" & \\"Sweet Emotion\\" on the radio & plus I already heard \\"Dream On\\" in the Autumn of 1973.  This was my very FIRST Aerosmith album. I can only say that I like it, but it isn't my favorite album @ all. Only 4 songs that are my favorites are \\"Uncle Salty\\", \\"No More, No More\\", \\"Round & Round\\" AND \\"Sweet Emotion\\". After all these years of listening to \\"Uncle Salty\\", I was shocked to discover that it was about prostitution. I always thought it was about a young girl being in a mental asylum, hence the one lyric \\"Ooh, It's a Sunny Day Outside My Window\\". Even though, \\"Uncle Salty\\" is not the least bit uplifting, it is a song that's NOT forgotten anytime soon, because of the Haunting lyrics. \\"Toys In the Attic\\" is a pretty good tune & I esp. LOVE the ARTWORK on the front & back of this record or CD. \\"You See Me Crying\\" is only a passable song which I can skip over, as it's the LAST song on this album. \\"Walk This Way\\" had a tendency to drive me nuts as I thought it was overplayed.  And to think it was remade TWICE in the Eighties, although Steven Tyler WAS featured on BOTH newer remakes. \\"Walk This Way\\" is NOT favorite song on this album & neither is the Crude \\"Big 10 Inch Record\\", which I could really do without. I almost forgot to mention that \\"Adam's Apple is a decent song. Even though this isn't my favorite Aerosmith album, it is recommended for a lot of others. 1974's \\"Get Your Wings\\" is MY all time favorite Aerosmith album.
B008COD5OO|4.0|Fun dumb movie to watch on the computer.  If you've got the time and want to veg out it's worth it,.
B003O5MO2A|4.0|This is a decent live in concert album by Blue Oyster Cult from 1975. My very favorites incl., here are \\"Harvester of Eyes\\" & \\"Maserati GT (I Ain't Got You)\\" which is 8:59 in length & it seems to feature parts of \\"Buck's Boogie\\" esp. towards the end of the song. I love \\"I Ain't Got You\\" very much, I just wish that it had MORE singing to it. I've always loved \\"Harvester of Eyes\\" too, on the \\"Secret Treaties\\" album, but this CONCERT version beats the original all to hell. Actually, I think, \\"Harvester of Eyes\\" should have been the OPENING song to this album, because \\"On Your Feet...\\" (title of album) is announced. Well anyway, \\"Harvester\\" makes a dynamite 2nd song followed by another great track \\"Hot Rails To Hell\\". As I mentioned on my \\"Tyranny & Mutation\\" album review, I'm NOT too crazy about \\"The Red & the Black\\" AND \\"Seven Screaming Dizbusters\\" @ all. \\"Subhuman\\" AND \\"ME 262\\" are very good & lengthy songs. \\"Born to Be Wild\\" is a remake of an old Steppenwolf classic orig. from 1968. Pretty good version here, but I really love THIS version from the Bonus Tracks on 1974's \\"Secret Treaties\\" album CD. Two other great songs are \\"Then Came the Last Days of May\\" AND \\"Cities on Flame w/ Rock & Roll\\"  This album is powerful & it's recommended.

B00919CI5Q|5.0|I had an Asus GTX 650 card for 5 months and loved it.  It ran very cool and completely silent.  But as an entry level card it is unable to run the latest games at 1080p, 60+fps, and high/max settings.<br /><br />I have an Asus motherboard and laptop as well.  Like the GTX 650 card they are very reliable.  So when I decided to upgrade my graphics card, Asus was the natural choice.<br /><br />The card is a little longer than the 650.  Most no-compact PC cases should have no problem fitting it.  The whole installation process (from start to firing up a game) took less than 10 minutes.<br /><br />So far I can confirm that it is able to run Starcraft II and Tomb Raider at max setting and 1080p.  (For Tomb Raider I turned tressfx, which causes glitches and drops fps by 30%).  I do not have fraps but given the smoothness of the games, I guess I am getting at least 100 fps.<br /><br />Word of advice - do not buy entry level cards.  Midrange cards offer the best combination of price and performance.  Currently GTX 660 cards sell for about 220-230 and 650 cards sell for about 150.  But 660 offers nearly twice the performance of 650.

B00846REIS|4.0|This was a good read.  It was definitely worth the purchase and I am really looking forward to reading entwined with you.
B003YGSLDA|4.0|Although in my opinion, this is the best Santa movie they ever made, with a fantastically authentic Toy Workshop and a reasonably good story line, it  missed a beat with our modern kids.  The story became a little complex and dragged out.  The movie was too long for a younger audience. The overall tale has a potential audience of 6-8 year olds, but parts of the story were more for 10-12 year olds, who would probably not watch it.<br />I was disappointed that this particular version from Amazon was not compatible with the Australian system, and for a trip down nostalgia lane, ended up buying a version that we could sucessfully watch.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It has been a very longtime since I could say I couldn't put a book down, but now I am! I wonder when the movie will come out? Who could play Amy?
B000MAH5O2|4.0|The Audacity of Hope is  truly fascinating book which gives deeper and clearer understanding of our current state of Politics. Barack Obama does a very good job of using personal examples from his life and the lives of those he is close to and using them to highlight key issues which face many Americans. There is little doubt that conservatives will take issue with many of his approaches to dealing with the issues that American's face, but they may find that they have at least some agreement on the overall goals and respect for his approach. So in this book, President Obama, being a senator from the democratic party, tries to respect and shows his empathy towards other Republican counterparts or tries to justify their position from an independent ground - showing that to achieve the goal of prosperity, one needs to work as a Uniter rather than divider.<br /><br />The best chapter of the book, chapter nine, \\"Family\\", focuses on family issues, and features stories both from Obama's childhood as well as the issues facing his family with Michelle and their two girls Malia and Sasha. He relates his issues with those facing most families, i.e. education, budget, time, and once again looks for areas of common ground on which to build. Many of these issues were touched upon in other areas of the book, as there is a tremendous amount of overlap between family, faith, and the other areas. This chapter definitely ties all the discussed issues together to show that even though he is a politician, he also goes through the challenges a like any other \\"common\\" people and that's why when he is challenging to resolve an issue it's not just a common issue - rather it's his own issue that he is trying to resolve in the national stage.<br /><br />This is truly a great book to read - however I would recommend getting the Audio Book unless you are a serious political junkie. Giving Four stars just because it can sometimes be very slow general people when he goes for detail discussion around an issue.
B0035RONVW|2.0|Their first LP since the reality dream trilogy and this one misses the mark. It seems to be going over territory which has been covered more than adequately previously - and does so without really doing anything compellingly interesting with it. Riverside has definitely moved on to harder, more intense sound when compared to their earlier albums, and they now just sound plain and boring. The intense yelling is disturbing and there is no imagination to this music. The positive is that they kept it short, because this LP is their weakest effort to date and definitely is in my opinion the wrong direction for this band. One note though, 'Left Out' is a great song.
B000FBFN0Q|3.0|the story was ehhh..i like the movie better. lol it was an interesting read to past the time. i like the movie a whole lot more though..lol
B001NERPHS|4.0|....to really enjoy this release.  I think those of us who like The Basement Tapes like it because it takes us back to a particular point in our lives that holds pleasant memories.  Much like a scent can trigger a long-forgotten memory, this compilation of songs takes me back to a simpler time in my life that, while seemingly happier than now, probably wasn't but memories do soften things considerably.  The singing is ragged, the music is, well, different but if you were around when this originally came out years ago and liked it then, you'll definitely still enjoy it in 2013.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|it's puuuurfect! if only my friend had a dvd player that plays blueray..now i have to take my ps3 to his place if we wanna watch it there. otherwise, i looove the movie..that's why i got it. it was shipped on time and in puuurfect condition. nice nice nice nice
0385347774|2.0|The print on this tiny paper back was so small needed it to be magnified. No copy right on this book either.
1455527475|4.0|First, the book should have been titled \\"My career at Goldman Sachs before and after the financial crisis\\" since the author's reason for leaving the firm occupies only the last quarter of the book.  Too much of the book is spent on personal anecdotes on individuals, client stories and parties.  If the purpose was to open GS to outsiders who care about the personalities of VPs, MPs, Associates etc., then the book is highly informative.  I had hoped that the book would also offer an insider's view of the big \\"financial crisis\\" issues: such as:<br /><br />* Why was Goldman operated as a hedge fund with leverage levels that made it vulnerable to collapse?<br /><br />* Why does the firm still have a net derivative exposure 7 times its risk-based capital, the highest among all federally chartered banks and seven times greater than Morgan Stanley?<br /><br />* Why was it OK for the taxpayers to cover Goldman's counterparty risk with AIG derivatives?<br /><br />* If Goldman and others are operating a rigged casino to fatten up partner and associate bonuses (total 2012 GS salary, bonus and perks spending was reported to be $13 billion, or about $400,000 per employee), then should the government ban proprietary trading?<br /><br />* Have the hundreds of trillions of dollars in derivative products peddled by Goldman and others merely set the stage for a worldwide financial system meltdown when the Central Banks cannot stop future runs on the counterparties and banks?<br /><br />These and other issues related to conflicts of interest, sleazy ethics and non-fiduciary conduct are of greater importance for reforming the financial services industry.<br /><br /> I give the author a great deal of credit for writing the book and op-ed piece since he is very cautious by nature and would even ask colleagues for advice on simple things, like whether to attend a colleague's bachelor party.  He is also an honorable man who appears sincere but in many ways still sees Wall Street people as basically good but that they work within a corrupt system.<br /><br /> Another view of the conduct he reveals (e.g., giving self-serving recommendations, taking the \\"axe off\\" Goldman's balance sheet) is that GS staff are acting like con men.  People who embezzle thousands of dollars get multi-year jail terms while Wall Street traders who intentionally fleece clients out of millions of dollars walk away rich after a few years of pirating.<br /><br /> I hope that this Mr. Smith can come to Washington and work for the structural reforms that are desperately needed.  The author wrote many market profiles while working for the firm; perhaps, future books and articles can explore solutions for the problems that remain.  Thanks for giving us a glimpse into the hidden world of Goldman Sachs.

B0041O40EI|3.0|I really like the idea of the old London puzzle topped with the current London landscape -- what a great concept.  The challenge is that both \\"layers\\" could definitely be improved upon.  The bottom Old London is all cut about the same and has various shades of brown, which are supposed to be buildings and roads.  Would be nice to have normally cut, variable pieces and some text on the map for things known at the time.  The current layer is foam based and doesn't always lay flat.  I would have preferred a more durable or heavy piece.  Bottom line is that I don't think I will do one again but glad I gave it a try.  My husband quit on the first day!

It even made it to #2 on the Billboard Charts the first week of it's release. I can only think that it's a true testament that everyone is hungry and thirsty for some great rock and roll. Don't be too critical about it. Play it. Enjoy it.

B005LAIH9A|5.0|The 'American Pie' series began with a really funny, rather silly, sophomoric, flick. The sequel, in my opinion, wasn't really exactly too great, than came 'American Wedding', which I loved, and really connected you deeper with the characters. By this time, if your a fan, and if your reading this likely most of you are, you need to see how it ends, quite simply, because it ends as good as it began.

B0032FPVKE|3.0|It's a nice bag, but the actual size of the bag is a little smaller than the dimensions given in the product description. For instance, it is described as being 7.9 inches long. My video camera is 7 inches long, but does not fit into the bag.<br /><br />If you're thinking about buying this bag, make sure your camera is no longer than 6 inches so it will fit.<br /><br />I will be returning it.

B0088OINTU|5.0|One of the greatest films of all time.  Any woman who hasn't stared at Peter O'toole's twenty something face for nearly four hours just hasn't lived.  Everything about this film is classic film at its best.
B0093BUWGE|5.0|A small club, no chairs, everybody standing, milling, wobbling with the beat. Lotta drinking, mostly beers with depth charges of vodka or tequila. Me, I blew the bartender away by asking for a Belgian ale with a depth charge of cognac. Possibly you have to hear Jose James at a club in order to grasp his Gestalt. I know I find this CD much more interesting after hearing the man live. He's witty, gentle, humane. Soft hands, you might say, for a scrawny guy with loose joints. Most of his humor deals with being \\"wasted.\\" Smashed. Soused. Whatever your idiom-generation. Is he stoned? Are all the dudes in the band? I wouldn't bet against it.<br /><br />There's a lot of variety in Jose James's music. Some critics might say he's still searching for his own identity. A little Johnny Mathis, a lot of Bobby McFerrin, a smidgin of Eminem? Hey, he's from Minneapolis! Blues-jazz-hiphop, according to his own publicity. But that's okay with me. He's a trained musician, he can comp. I'd be bored with any single version of Jose James, but when he surprises me every number, I sit up and listen. Or stand, as the case may be. He's open-ended. This CD includes a Hindu musician. The band I heard included a black Japanese trumpeter, whose jazz improvs got livelier the more blotto he looked. That band was a quintet, all shades of black and tan except for one stiff-faced working-class English bloke ... on the drums. A certain historical irony there: think of the jazz quintets of Dave Brubeck or Chet Baker, all white except the drummers.<br /><br />This isn't the sort of music I listen to most of the time. I'm not really qualified to critique it on its own terms. Baroque and Classical fans, just give it a try. You might respond to it.
0670026603|5.0|Loved this thought provoking story.  Liked the story and the characters. Very unusual love story.  This book totally kept my interest and I read it in no time at all.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|Sometimes fact and fiction can get blurred.  Is it not true that a dream is a wish the heart makes. This book makes you feel that good will always prevail and magic is as real as evil, just less obvious. A good read that leaves you with a good feeling.
0393343405|3.0|Without a doubt this book makes an interesting and entertaining read. The fluid prose and dynamic story-telling can only be applauded. But as \\"history\\" it shows a lack of understanding of basic undergraduate themes. It is filled with sweeping assertions and long-debunked paradigms. Since most of the other reviewers have discussed some of the problems with his main thesis I will discuss some of the smaller \\"facts\\" that others have not discussed.  Particularly unsatisfactory is his skewed portrait of late Roman and Medieval European History that tends to paint heroic intellectual \\"pagans\\" against persecuting  ignorant Christians. So too does Byzantium disappear from a story where it should have played a central role. A few examples should suffice.<br /> Adrianople was lost by the Eastern not the Western Roman army. Though a devastating defeat, it had little long-term impact in the East, and actually created a flourish of literature trying to explain the defeat (e.g. the histories of Ammianus and Eunapius). It certainly played little or no part in what G describes as the \\"fall\\" of the Western Roman Empire a century later. Indeed the Eastern Romans would reclaim for a time much of it's \\"lost\\" territory in the sixth century. His vision of illiterate hordes off barbarians hauling off educated Romans in the fifth century into slavery has been pass&eacute; for fifty years. Literary culture certainly did not come to a screeching halt in Italy with the arrival of the Goths, as the works of Cassiodorus and others attest. Ammianus, who Greenbalt describes as writing at the end of the classical world, actually wrote his grand history at a time of a great revival of classical literature amongst Christians and non-Christians in the West and the East. Though Ammianus' was the last great history in Latin, classical historiography had a great revival in the fifth and sixth centuries in the eastern half of the Empire. Ammianus' work was published throughout the Empire and was certainly read by many Roman elites in the east and the West, as would the history of Procopius published in Greek a 150 years later. The works of Ammianus' contemporary, the poet Claudian, crafted for the Christian court of the emperor Honorius, reveal a great deal of interest in ancient authors and non-Christian themes. For this development see the works of Alan Cameron. See Cameron as well for a complete dismissal of the idea that the emperor Theodosius I launched a massive anti-pagan campaign at the end of the fourth century that crushed the dying embers of classical learning by an ever-dwindling group of \\"noble pagans\\".  Indeed, the great rift between Christians and pagans in this period has been thoroughly debunked by numerous scholars in the past 20 years.  Christian intellectuals of this period were greatly interested in the works of classical writers like Virgil and Cicero.<br />Greenbalt says very little indeed about the Byzantine Empire where many of these ancient works continued to be read and copied throughout its history. Certainly it played a vital role in preserving many ancient authors and texts. The eastern Roman Empire, indeed, had a flourishing literary community throughout most of its history. Most of the great works of ancient literature could be found in the bookstalls and libraries of the Byzantine world. See, e.g. the sixth-century Byzantine historian Agathias' description of a thriving book trade in Constantinople. For this on-going love of its Greco-Roman literary culture see the works of Anthony Kaldellis.<br /><br />Moreover, rigorist Christians like Jerome should not be portrayed as 'typical\\" Christians. He was seen as an extremist in his own times.<br /><br />Literary culture in Alexandria certainly did not change noticeably after the lynching of Hypatia.<br />Finally, many twelfth-century scholars had dealt with the \\"revolutionary\\" developments Greenblatt discusses. While this is a well-written piece of literature....based as it is on many long-dismissed paradigms... as \\"history\\" it would not be approved by any Phd committee.missed paradigms... as \\"history\\" it would not be approved by any Phd committee.
B000UR9QIK|5.0|Many claim this film as the best zombie movie of all time.  Its definitely worth a look for new zombie fans.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Nice game, I wish that everything would work properly. I keep wasting coins because feed and other things just don't function properly. These are known problems so hopefully they will be fixed soon.
B000YPUFA6|3.0|Not even the best in the series.  The Resident Evil movies could have been the scariest movies ever made, and instead became sci-fi action.  still, worth a watch on a rainy day.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Gives the span of time from the end of WW I until the end of WW II from all different perspectives through the use of personal stories.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|The best zombie movie in the last 20 years.  Just be sure to tell your girlfriend its a romantic comedy.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Just the installation of this cooler dropped my CPU core temps an average of 20 degrees C over the stock cooler.  WELL WORTH IT!
B0046MOVD0|4.0|This film attempts to fix the damage done by the 3rd film.  Though still sci-fi action crap, there are elements of the game and a little horror mixed in.
0793563836|5.0|Easy to plays, CD is great, book is great, save money on buy 1,2 and 3 bound. I play the CD and follow the Book, if you are planing to play Bass for Church, this book will help a lot.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Around the World in 80 days has stunning graphics, an interesting and likeable storyline, and addictive match 3 game play...Definitely, worth only $5...It passes the time when you may get bored...Also, the game isn't too easy or isn't too hard...It is just right and extremely fun!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I don't think of this book as a teen book.  It is more like a satire of what may become of this country if people don't educate themselves.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love this show. I am hooked on the show and am currently on session 3.  It makes me think but has the perfect combo of csi and sci-fi :)
B0097HSS4M|4.0|I love all the options! Obviously not all the perks and effects as a high end apple app but this is at least worth 3 dollars so 99 cents is a steal! You can easily transform pimple faces, shiny spots and dull backgrounds to a great photo!
B0038AMW6Y|4.0|This is a nice way to cheer up your drive time - though it was hard not to want to swing along.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I never thought I would like Anime and resisted watching it for years. My Japanese daughter-in-law turned me on to this type of entertainment. I am 60 years old and love this movie. The artwork is amazing. I have never seen anything like it. Shadows, breaking of branches, leaves blowing. It is amazing. The people look like cartoons, albeit well-illustrated, but meld easily into the extremely realistic scenery. The story is great. Kept my interest for the whole time. It starts off a little \\"fake\\" with a giant boar but give it time. It really develops into an amazing story the whole family will enjoy. I have been watching many of Miyazaki's movies now. They are all good and different. You won't be disappointed.<br />Update: I just got a gift certificate for Christmas and bought this DVD. I watched it last night for the second time and was even more impressed. So much detail and forethought into the drawings and characters. There is a scene, in the beginning, where the male lead takes his bow off his shoulder and restrings it. I mean, how many illustrators would think of that? Most \\"cartoons\\" would just have the person shooting the bow. The shadows, the fog and rain...amazing artwork. But it isn't that alone. The stroy is really good and send a good message on protecting the planet. I have not watched the English-speaking part yet...I just love hearing the Japanese inflections. Could not believe how much strong language was used. Cursing on a cartoon? I didn't mind it. It fit the scene but I am guessing that the English-speaking option does not have it especially since Disney now owns it. Funny, touching and dramatic movie that I would have to put on my top movies of all time if watched in Japanese with English subtitles.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game was absolutely amazing. BTD was OK, hard because not many towers were available. The 2nd went a bit farther but not any more interesting. The third was a big upgrade. New maps, towers,bloons, was great but i ended up using only beacons, Super monkeys, and missiles. The 4th added experience. Made the game more exiting trying to unlock all the towers and upgrades but still got stuck with super monkeys and way to easy to get money. This one added classes, new maps, more towers, MISSIONS and bloons, and more need to knows, like camos are only able to be seen by a tower that has a camo ability or beacon. This game was the best so far. I just hope you add a level editor like in the fourth on the computer and make your own mission. I really liked the latest update. New map added and a sanbox was added. Looking forward to BTD6. Keep the updates comming:)
B0001XAPY2|5.0|They movie was beautiful to watch. Excellent artistry and great story. Really different. I never watch these movies with the English soundtrack. I prefere the Japanese with English subtitles so I can't comment on the other. There is so much to look at when watching Miyazaki's movies. Details in everything. Lots of cool planes and characters. I loved it and want to buy it.
0802473156|5.0|Excellent way to capture individual spirit and needs. If folks read and apply to not just love relationships you would see improvement in your relationships based on the love languages.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Holy cow...this was a great movie. I'm telling you, I am 60 years old and could watch this stuff all day long. Beautiful movie...all the wood grain, flowers, bugs flying. Miyazaki is a genius. So much different than American cartoons or stories. I do not look at these as cartoons. The stories and artistry are very detailed. I never watch these movies with the English soundtrack. Always the Japanese with English subtitles. I checked this out from the library and it had two discs with really good special features. The Japanese speaking people are just more dramatic in their speaking which really melds with the story. I love the background music that is played in almost all of his movies. I don't want to give anything away so I just want to comment on how good this is. Amazing that the animation is hand drawn and not computer-generated. This is probably the best movie by Miyazaki. Over two hours long but it goes fast.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Hadn't been this caught up in a book in a long time. Great pacing and had me up many nights.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Yes! Terrific sequel that keeps the energy of the first book going. Excellent writing, fresh twists and turns in the story, I can't wait to finish this review so I can start reading the next one in the series!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not something I'd pick again for content.  I don't mind a little sex thrown into a plot... but not into books where sex is the main theme.  I can see where some people can get sucked into, pun intended, this genera but it got boring after awhile.  Actually skipped through some of \\"those\\" parts just to see if there was more to the story other than sex or at least what was happening in the relationship.  At least there was a play to make it about relationships... barely.  And of course it leaves you hanging enough to try and get you into the next book.  Probably not! :)
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Awesomest book ever beside Percy Jackson. The first and only time some died was bast. And  like if you think Carter likes zoe
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Love love love Harry Potter, and this was on sale for about $8 when I bought it. Can't go wrong with that!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci is an excellent mystery writer. This book is a real page turner.<br />I am looking forward to reading more of his books!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|i love this movie, and have told tons of people about it. As far a recent westerns go, I think its better than Jango.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app works great, my daughter uses it for her school work. she says that it works better than her scientific calculater that I bought her.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Generally what I like best about Grisham is that he makes me think about issues. This one didn't give me so much to think about. It was more like a bad taste in my mouth for the justice system.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Graphic are awesome! I not a big horse fan,but this a really fun game got it for my kids and I think I play it more then they do!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Im addicted!  I love this darn app.  Great little time waster. Good graphics.and the music isnt annoying. Very glad I gave this one a try.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|game is fun, however,  pop up ads are annoying and interfere with game play,  would be much more fun without incessant ads
B004H3WWU2|5.0|Love my new bag!!! It has all the little compartments I need. The really good thing about it is it's just the right size for my going to and from work without feeling bulky. Wish the interior comes in blue, but other than that, it's such an awesome bag!!! I love it!
B0086700CM|4.0|Ahhhhhhh. Get used to that sound you'll be hearing it a lot in this game. It is totally fun running from creepy apes. However you tend to slam into trees get fried eaten and fall off cliff which frustrates you to the point where you do want to uninstall it. I would recommend this game just remember it will frustrate you at times but hang in there.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This was a good page-turner, but it is worth noting that the intended audience of this work is young adults.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is original for about twenty minutes of play time. Then comes the repetitive qualities that always accompany running games. Despite being repetitive it is quite fun to dodge on coming trains and obstacles. While your playing this game remember that after a while you'll be surfing the app store for a new game. It is totally free but pesters you with adds. Otherwise have fun playing it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|original love story, ethical issues, amusing and gripping, recommended to all my friends who are all enjoying it also.<br />main character has a Bridget Jones vibe  to her.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I'd seen the movie and listened to the audio book.  It describes a love few of us {or maybe it's just me} encounter.  To the romantics out there, if you haven't seen it, buy it!
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz just keeps getting better....how many times can you listen to Rainy Night in Georgia...the answer is endless!!!  His talent is evident in this CD as well as his other catalogue offerings.<br />Boz..we love you and always have!!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Can't add to what others have added, extensively. Just want to give my five star rating. Very entertaining. Excellent story line and some surprices.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My name is Brianna and I love this game .it is very fun and hard at<br />the same  time .
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is the best written show on TV with an awesome cast! Can't wait until until its released on BR
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved this book I couldn't help not reading it, and it was better than the movie The Wizard of Oz
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Could not put this book down! Picoult makes tragic stories suspenseful and intriguing that you can't get enough of! Only complaint.... as a competitive swimmer some of the swimming I terminology was incorrect, but it is actually impressive when people get it right since it is such an infrequent sport
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This is one of the best series of books I have read in forever. Ms. Rice grabs you from the start and will not let you go till the end. I read all three books in 2 days. Now I have to wait for number 4. If you liked the Fire and Ice series then you will love this.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|It was brand new still in the packaging. I am very happy to add this to my collection. Hours of enjoyment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it.. My friend originally introdouced it to me... Great graphics great storyline (if there is one.. c:) yup.. :3
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|I think it was okay. i had a lot of playback issues so no congruent storyline in my head. I know I like that actor (Ethan Hawke or Kevin Bacon) and it was scary and creepy though.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I loved the movie.  It was powerful, and immersed my thoughts and emotions.  Not a clear plot, nor effective in gratifying those looking for a 'great story'.
0439023491|3.0|Overall, this wasn't my favorite book of the three. I didn't like the beginning, as it was all just flashbacks of what happened after the Hunger Games, so it wasn't interesting or exciting like the other books in the series. The middle of the book was pretty exciting and violent, so that was good in my opinion. Most of the new characters were actually interesting. In my opinion, the thing that wasn't great about this book is that it was the middle book. It's just filling space in the series. However, I think the ending is the best part of the entire book because it's a cliff hanger. It definatly wanted me to keep on reading into the next book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|GOOD BOOK FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS OF ALL AGES EVEN MY FRIENDS ENJOYED THE BOOK<br /><br />KATNISS IS IN BEAST MODE
B008B11R2A|5.0|REMINDS ME OF RADIOHEAD, BUT IN A GOOD WAY. Every second on this album is delicate and leaves you wanting more. Buy this, listen to it at least twice, and then bask in the radiance of brilliant music.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|This book is a good read, once you get past the military facts.  I liked the diverse characters of the camel club.  They kept the story interesting and amusing.  Very different from other Baldacci's books I have read.  But a very good book.
