0201633612|4.0|This is one of those books I think everyone should read. It's not that you need to use the design patterns by name (please don't) or exactly as specified. It's that the book illustrates some very effective ways to think about software design.    I've seen far too many people - especially those fresh out of college or those who have never worked in a top company - think that as long as the software works, it's good enough. And, those who know that that's not true may not know HOW to design good software.    This book suggests a number of different ways of doing object orient design that will do a nice job of illuminating the wide variety of ways. The examples could be a bit clearer, but all in all I feel it's a very effective book.
B003L77G38|5.0|Guys I know this has been said over and over again, but we really need to drive this home. Fringe is an outstanding, original sci-fi drama that deserves to be on TV a lot more than some other shows that aren't in Fringe's shoes. So support Fringe, buy the Season 3 DVD when it comes out, but more importantly, clear a spot on your schedule on Friday nights and watch it. It's worth it, I promise.

I purchased the book for myself and then ordered three more for my daughters.  Meal preparation is a snap!  The tips given through the book are so helpful.  I am losing inches and feel wonderful.  I simply love it.  Thank you Timothy Ferriss for all the research and insight given in this book.

B001E57SH8|5.0|I admit that I read a ton of bad reviews of the Zippo Blu lighters online. I figured at a good price and with Zippo's lifetime warranty it was worth a shot. My last lighter was a more expensive Colibri, which failed after about 2 years. I am extremely pleased with this lighter. It lights every time I use it. Many complaints about the Zippo Blu that I read online said it only lights about 1 out of every 3-6 tries, especially when new. Here's a tip: Make sure you actually see the butane in the window on the side. I filled according to directions initially, but couldn't see the butane in there, and it would only light about 1 out of 5 tries. Then I refilled it until I could see the butane in the window, and it lights every single time. Also make sure you use Zippo butane or you will void the warranty.
B000077VR3|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  I was happy to see that there were no scratches on the DVD and it played perfectly.  It arrived in a timely fashion and the condition was exactly as described. Great shopping experience, as always, with Amazon.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|First, I'm not really sure why the star rating on this item says \\"How much fun is this game?\\" and \\"How do you rate this game overall?\\" since it isn't a game, but a gaming headset.    Anyway, on to the actual product. These headphones are very comfortable (probably the most comfortable ones I've owned), surprisingly light and the volume and overall sound quality is wonderful. For some reason I can't get sound from my XBox 360 if a pass the sound through my Sharp LCD TV, only by hooking directly to the optical port on the 360. I DO, however, get sound through the TV from my cable box, strange. I'm sure if I had a receiver with optical and HDMI inputs, this wouldn't be a problem.    I haven't actually played online with them yet but the voice microphone seems VERY sensitive. I play with a friend who has the same set and can hear almost everything in the room he's in, not just his voice.    The only issue I have is that there is a slight humming through the headphones if no sound is being sent through. This becomes unnoticed, though, when you actually feed audio through them. I'm not sure if it is feedback, interference as others have experienced or what. Only time will tell I guess.
B002ZG993Q|2.0|the plot is confusing, George Clooney plays an agent of who, or what. the scenery is not as i expected very little shown of the city or place where it was filmed. Didnt like it much. I expected a better role for George Clooney other actors dont know who they are.
B004MDXMS8|4.0|This episode was pretty good.  It involved an intriguing(and creepy) case, but gave a little too much screen time to the case.    That being said- the final 10 minutes were exceptional.  The music was perfect.  Love the surreal feel to it.  And WHAT A SET UP!!!!  BRAVO!!!! ENCORE!!!!!!!!!!!    P.S.- To the \\"Rip Off\\" Review- 10 Cents???  A Dollar is reasonable- and 1.99 is no more than ITunes Charges.  You are not paying to WATCH The episode- you are BUYING the episode.    Seeing that a season usually costs 60 dollars on DVD- it is not a bad deal.

B0044FEZBC|3.0|Alexey Ratmansky managed to re-vitalize an old Socialist propaganda ballet. His choreography builds on classic steps and has enough bravura to show the spectacular technique of the dancers yet it looks modern, with intriguing characterization. The story is still a bit much about the revolutionary masses to my taste, though a love story between a young aristocratic girl a peasant boy, improbable as it is in historical context, adds a lot of lyricism.   Dancers are great in typical Bolshoi style: bombastic and lacking in nuance and restrain ( with some exception), but with spectacular technique bordering on acrobatics.   Ballet is also well filmed: dancers shown full lengths so one can appreciate the dancing, just like Fred Astaire who insisted on being filmed in full height in his dancing sequences. It is overall a delightful Blu-Ray.
0439023513|5.0|I have never reviewed any book series, but I was reading some of the bad reviews and had to add my points!!        ********************  SPOILERS ******************************************** SPOILERS **************************         I see a lot of people wanted Katniss to  be this huge hero and be in control and they don't like the broken state she is left in, but really if you think about all you read and all she has been through and all that she has LOST can you really see her all put together and in complete control of her wits? I couldn't do it, and I thought the ending was beautiful!! She just wants to be left alone and the fact that she got peeta back ( maybe not whole) but more than she expected!! This book also did such a wonderful job at making you care for all the supporting characters, even the style crew!! Wonderful series!!! I will be reading these series again, and this is a must own series!!!
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|I love this 2-cd set. I've always really liked kd lang, but not enough to buy individual records. This is a collection of all her best hits, and every single song on here is outstanding. She chooses songs which make the most of her killer voice. It's a very good price for this set....don't hesitate to get it!!!
1933492929|5.0|Terryl Whitlatch is one of the greatest creature designers in the entertainment industry, if not the greatest. This book is packed with some of the most outstanding and breath taking designs I've ever seen. Her understanding of animal anatomy is unequaled in the field of entertainment design and she shows that knowledge off throughout the whole book, even including muscle and skeletal diagrams of some of the beasts.    She also developes a mini-world in the book, where a giant creature has its own ecosystem on it's back. This ecosystem is detailed with descriptions of creatures who act as predator and prey, how they interact and how they survive.    It's a must have for any fan of creatures, whitlatch, and creativity.
B003DZX44I|4.0|Great bluray disc, despite the tiresome problem of not being able to skip all the warnings and so forth before getting to the film itself. The transfer and sound are amazing.     But Disney still seems to get a pass from everyone on one point--none of these versions is the uncut theatrical print. The Gaston song has been trimmed--at the end of the reprise, as part of the song, LaFou spells out Gaston's name and makes a mistake, causing Gaston to clobber him. This sequence was in when it was first released to theaters (and really was funny), but it has been edited out of every home video version, and sadly this one is no exception. Why? Is this some politically correct thing where they are worried about offending people who make spelling mistakes?  Deduct one star from what is otherwise a great package.
193413712X|3.0|\\"Tinkers\\" is a complex elegiac meditation on the insubstantiality of human life.  A dying man witnesses the collapse of his personality structure and with that his obscure ties to those with whom he has shared the experiences of a lifetime.  In the throes of his dying he realizes that the circadian rhythms of nature revealed to him though his association with his father have defined what meaning he is legitimately able to hold on to in the experience of dying.  Alas, for George Washington Crosby, it is not his extended family, his home or metaphorically, his personality, or even his wife that have fired the actions of a lifetime, but the physics of the experience of living, the mechanical aspects of day by day motion.  These \\"tinkerings\\" have afforded him momentary satisfactions and limited opportunities.  For in the end, Harding implies, we are all tinkers, trying to make our inconsequential lives work for us.  In the process, we each seek our share of self-gratification and make our own imprudent decisions before the final \\"taking of a toast and tea,\\" as T.S. Eliot so aptly described that final reckoning.<br /><br />To convey the unfathomable substance of life, Harding uses a cacophony of voices, stylistic techniques, and writing styles, as if to suggest that the examined life is nothing short of ponderous and unsatisfying.  There is no \\"truth\\" to be gleaned from the experience; life is what it is: quantum soup.  As such, man struggles through it, inspired by the beauty of the natural world and appropriately diminished by life's banality and disappointments.  In the final analysis, even human intimacy is denied the pilgrim; man's destiny is to satisfy himself with the objective, shifting realities of the world, since there isn't much more to hang one's hat upon.  The beauty of nature and knowledge of the workings of things are all man can hope to fill his hungry heart.  To seek beyond that limited understanding is absurd.  Thus was George Washington Crosby's vocation as a high school mechanical drawing teacher and guidance counselor apropos for a man who intuitively recognized life's limitations.<br /><br />Most disturbing is the fact that the people with whom George shares his last days and moments are ghostly presences, only one of them seemingly a companion on that final lap to oblivion.  This person is, of course, his deceased father, a tinker, who first exposed the young and confused George to the grandeur of the natural world.  A poet of sorts, Howard, an epileptic, experienced in his disastrous seizures the otherworldly glimpses of light and truth that fortified him enough to endure a loveless marriage and the gut wrenching poverty of a salesman and fixer-tinker.  Unable to bring love into his life, he continued to struggle on in the face of illness and poverty because he had children to support and because he was strong in the face of adversity.  However, when he must eventually face the fact that his wife neither loves nor respects him, he moves on to build a new life that is emotionally rewarding.  This alteration of values and loyalties suggests the impermanence of relationships and the futility of idealizing the temporal.<br /><br />Harding compares human life to the intricate workings of a clock.  George repairs clocks to supplement his retirement and finds solace in the sounds of their constant ticking.  The clocks, mechanical objects of precision and complexity, provide the central metaphor of Harding's musings.  They are reliable, complex machines that can be put to careful use, like a good horse or a cart, but they lack the capacity to make life anything other than absurd.  Both Howard and George can discern the blending of light and dark in the landscapes of their lives, but neither can perceive any truth that lies beyond their mere struggles to survive.  Both are consoled by the beauty of the physical world, its astounding detail and precision of form, but like Howard's father who dies in an insane asylum,both men realize the impossibility of fathoming meaning beyond the physical world.  Short miraculous moments of say, building a bird's nest or repairing a clock cannot fill the gaps created by a loveless marriage or open up for a despairing woman a hole in the ice when it is frozen solid.  The short moments of feeling connected to nature cannot explain why a father would abandon his children or a woman would commit her husband to an institution, but they are the compensatory gifts of being human - man's only consolation for the seeming lack of meaning or joy one expects of life.  Howard's father, a minister, is so baffled by his inability to grasp the meaning of life that he goes crazy.  Incurring epilepsy as a result of his father's insanity, Howard engages in a lifelong search for meaning, tinkering his way among people in a hopeless quest for meaning and community.  However, even these attempts are quelled by women who insist that things not change, that even a new brand of soap cannot clean any better than the old.  Nothing changes; nothing gets any better.  Through such annoyances, Howard patiently labors to please and to succeed in his meager profession - against all odds, like Sisyphus rolling the rock up the hill, only to let it go and begin once more the exhausting occupation of heaving it upward.<br /><br />At one point Howard notes that a clock or \\"The universe's time cannot be marked thusly.  Such a crooked and flimsy device could only keep the fantastic hours of unruly ghosts.\\"  And so it is that as George transitions into the netherworld he experiences a \\"shifting mass, the tiles of a mosaic spinning, swirling , reportraying, always in recognizable swaths of colors, familiar elements, molecular units, intimate currents, but also independent now of his will, showing him a different self every time he tried to make an assessment.\\"  And although \\"George never permitted himself to imagine his father,\\" he finds their lives inextricably bound by his becoming a Methodist, Congregationalist and finally a Unitarian, marrying, moving, teaching mechanical drawing, playing poker and fishing - all conventional, simple activities of the living being.  Because life is hard and evades explanation,  he forgave his mother her \\"contrary heart,\\" even though her actions forever dissolved the marriage of his parents and separated him from his father.  George realized that \\"bitterness staunched her disappointment.\\" She was simply unable to rise above her despair.  Such is the existential lot of all humans.  At one point George makes a cassette of his life in an attempt to grasp some meaning and convey it to his family, but the process results in his \\"lamenting the loss of this world of light and hope.\\" He openly weeps at the recognition of how little measure there is when one confronts the story of his own existence.<br /><br />Yet Howard is capable of a rare intuitive process, possibly the result of his seizures when he \\"became pure, unconscious energy.\\"  Howard thus intuits the death of Gilbert, the hermit.  From him he inherits an aged copy of \\"The Scarlet Letter,\\" symbolizing man's emotional isolation and opacity.  Yet through the various disappointments of his life, George exemplifies \\"a heart open to nature and a head devoted to the advancement of men.\\"  Life for George, and perhaps his father as well, is in the details.  In the end these details unite the two men; they are alter egos in terms of their grasp of the world.  It is significant that George is dying of renal failure.  It is the buildup of disappointment and seeming waste that causes his death.  He recalls his father's love of wildflowers, and the memory is consoling as are the images of nature.  He notes \\"But those pieces, smooth and glossy and lacquered, are the dark tablets of my death in gray and black and bleached, drained, and until they are in place, everything else will keep on shifting.\\"  Although there are momentary intimations of meaning, man is ultimatelyignorant of the vast workings of the universe.  For Howard, the pictures of angels in the family bible instilled fear; for George his own intuitive leanings are not gifts of faith, but its opposite, more adequately depicted in his final hallucinations of the collapse of his house, house being the classic Jungian metaphor of the personality structure.  In viewing the falling down of his house around him, Harding harkens back to Poe's \\"The Fall of the House of Usher.\\"  In the end the sentient man is nothing but a devastated structure - useless and forlorn, like a lost dog.  Despairing and without hope.  Likewise, Harding implies a transcendental mingling with the elements when man dies, like Bryant's \\"Thanatopsis\\":  George  realizes \\"the dark tablets of my death\\" will be a \\"scrolling\\" which will move about and be \\"mingled with in endless ways of other people's memories, so that I will remain a set of impressions porous and open to combination with all the other vitreous squares floating about in whoever else's frames.\\"  Man is part of the whole of nature \\"back  to Adam\\".  However, that commonality with nature does not grant man the capacity to understand the complexity of life.  George also notes:  that although the \\"mystery\\" of life is man's to ponder, the condition of life itself is a \\"puzzle\\" that never quite fits together.  And thus does \\"life\\" not just \\"stop,\\" but \\"simply ends.\\"  Life is best summed up: \\"The ache in your heart and the confusion in your soul means that you are still alive, still human, and still open to the beauty of the world, even though you have done nothing to deserve it.\\" Howard further notes, \\"And when you resent the ache in your heart, remember: You will be dead and buried soon enough.\\"  Life is struggle; make the most of it by \\"blending with the elements.\\"<br /><br />In terms of characterization, one might argue that all three men: Howard, his father, and George, are self-absorbed, meditative loners whose bafflement with the world might be rooted in their inabilities to connect with people.  They are shadowy presences in the minds of those around them much as are the companions at George's death bed ghosts of times past, beings with whom George shared little and reaped the same.  One might argue with George's death bed glimpses into the hollowness of life.  Perhaps had he committed his time to others - deeply and profoundly - he might have left the world differently, perhaps in the warm cocoon of humans loving him and wishing him well through the bardos awaiting him on his journey.<br /><br />The book has poetic passages, as others have noted.  The narrative is somewhat of a mishmash of styles, points of view and devices, and as such lacks a certain coherence, as far as I'm concerned.  Most of the book is elegiac and meditative.  I prefer books with more of a plot.  A Pullitzer Prize recipient, it is compared to Marilyn Robinson's \\"Housekeeping,\\" one of my favorite literary novels.  I see the reason for the comparison but would not place \\"Tinkers\\" at that level.  In Robinson's case, the ideas are clearly communicated without didacticism.  There is a plot that guides the development of the work and although it is dark and explosive in its exploration of the human condition, it is also more complete and coherent.<br /><br />\\"Tinkers,\\" tends to be obscure, loosely plotted, ambiguous in its implications, and lacking in action.  However, \\"Tinkers\\" is truly American as evidenced by the transcendental threads running through it and by the countless elliptical references in tone and language to revered American writers.  In the end, implies Harding, we are all tinkers, tinkering away at life, plumbing some of its complex mechanics, such as the inner workings of a clock, for example, but never, except in intimations of nature or observing its imagery does man apprehend anything but despair and obscurity.  Now how populist and American is that?  I'm sure Emerson is taking it all in as we speak...  After all, it is man's self-reliance that equips him both to acknowledge and accept the limitations of being human.<br /><br />Marjorie Meyerle<br />Colorado Writer<br />Author: \\"Bread of Shame\\"iverse.

B004GGQMRY|1.0|What a HORRIBLE release of a GREAT movie...what in the world were they thinking formatting the BLU-RAY release in pan & scan FULL-FRAME?!?!?  I was all set to buy this, but luckily checked the specs first! I wasn't even aware any blu-rays were being released in full frame format; now I will have to start double-checking specs on each new blu ray purchase to make sure, just like with the old DVD's...what a downturn in blu-ray tech.
0439023513|3.0|As I've writted in the reviews for the other two books, I LOVE this series.  I really loved Hunger Games, loved Catching Fire even more, but Mockingjay just isn't the book it should have been or could have been.<br /><br />The last third of the book is rushed and I feel like I was robbed.  I know not every story has the happy go-lucky ending.  I just wanted to some to see certain relationships flesh out into what I was hoping they'd become.<br /><br />The ending was... well, again, it was rushed.  Was I happy about the end result?  Yeah, I guess.  I just wanted to READ more, and I really feel like there should have been one last chapter to wrap up things, not just a paragraph and an epilogue.<br /><br />Overall, the story is worth reading.  I've read a lot of reviews regarding this book and I think many make a good point - but honestly, I would love to see this made for the silver screen.  I'd love to see this acted out.  The stories ARE good, and that's what really matters.  I just have to leave the parts Collins didn't write up to my imagination.
1594202842|5.0|I just finished this book a few minutes ago.  It is wonderfully written and should be read by all mothers.  It's great to see different perspectives on parenting.  We all want what is best for our children.  In this book, the author chooses for her children to engage in  music lesson for long periods and berates them during their practice time.  She also offers praise when it is earned. I have seen the same with other genres from Western parents in dance, soccer, and especially football.  I have also seen parents let their children linger in front of the TV for two or more hours at a stretch. Would they be better off playing the piano during that time? Who knows? This books makes you think and reflect on the mother that you are and what you value for your children. This book should not be read not as a play by play instruction book for how to be a Chinese mother.  That was not the author's intention.
0439023491|5.0|I think Catching Fire falls in the law of diminishing returns... the first was really good, the second even better... I blasted through this book in a record time and really started to think about how this may just be my favorite series of all time.  Even though I was disappointed with the last third of the third book, it won't keep me from encouraging others to read the series.
0689865384|4.0|I lost sleep over this book. I purchased it and read it all in the same evening, refusing to go to sleep until I'd read the last page. There are so many things I enjoyed about this. The unique little twist on a rigidly controlled, dystopian society by including an operation to make everyone uniformly beautiful made this a step up from others which simply mimic '1984.'    The two things I enjoyed most about this were definitely the suspense and the characters. My relationship with the main character, Tally, was very touch and go to begin with. I found myself loving and hating her during the exposition, where she sometimes acts like a charming daredevil, and then conversely a whiny, petulant child. It was during her journey to the Smoke, after being blackmailed by Special Circumstances, that I truly came to love and understand her. She was willing to go to such lengths to get the things she wanted, and that made her transformation during her time in the Smoke that much more riveting. Her development resonated with me.     Lately, I have also been finding the romance plots of YA fiction to be contrived and superficial, but I really enjoyed her relationship with David. Due to the very nature of this book's premise, it's immediately apparent that these two characters are not attracted to one another for looks alone - they respect each other for those qualities which are more than skin deep. David admires her for her resolve and ability to take her life in the Smoke seriously, while she respects him for his maturity and competence in living without city luxuries.    The other thing I must also compliment is the author's ability to show both the pros and cons of both societies - the tyrannical city versus the natural village of the wilds. Neither are painted as pure good or pure evil. That the people living under tyranny are HAPPY can't be overlooked - there is definitely an allure about a world that lacks war, pollution and discrimination. The ethical issues raised are controversial and I look forward to seeing how they're handled in the sequels. I hope to see real reasons why such a society SHOULDN'T exist when it functions more happily and peacefully than our own, and that these things aren't dismissed as irrelevant, OTHER than the fact it's naturally repugnant to people like us who've lived with more liberty than the people of New Pretty Town.    If I had one complaint, it was that the plot was a bit predictable, and David's reaction to Tally's admission of guilt seemed unrealistic. There were also a number of plot holes that had me puzzling over the competence of Special Circumstances (it's referenced multiple times that some uglies run away to the Smoke, then decide they don't like it and return to be made pretties... Why doesn't Special Circumstances instruct these kids to lead them to the Smoke instead of sending Tally with her cryptic little code? Doesn't seem to make sense, since Special Circumstances also alludes to having known about the Smoke for awhile now... I also found it unusual that Special Circumstances doesn't notice the flares going up in the Ruins when uglies go to meet David there...) Otherwise, this story gripped me and carried me straight to the end, and I was willing to overlook these setbacks because the ride was worth the bumps. A very enjoyable read, easier to slip into than your favourite pair of shoes.
B0043CJ980|4.0|Short and sweet here...<br /><br />I love the album.  I can listen to it from beginning to end and not skip one song.  It's a great example of what Maroon 5 is and the influences they have.<br /><br />Great addition to anyone's collection.
1594201749|5.0|There is much more background than in the movie, \\"Invictus\\";  it is worth reading about it.   The last 100 pages are nothing less than candy - a delight for the mind, nourishment for the spirit.   I give this book a very strong recommendation.    g
0439023521|5.0|There isn't a whole lot I could say about this book that hasn't already been said.  Simply put, I purchased all three books at the same time because I had heard so much about the series that I figured it was worth my time.  No doubt, it really truly was one of the best books I've read in a very long time.  I enjoyed the second book as much as the first.  The third book is essential to read to have closure, as it's essential for the reader.  However, I was disappointed in the last third of the third book BUT it doesn't change my love of the story.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|\\"Resident Evil: Afterlife\\" continues the story of Alice in her battle with the Umbrella Corporation and their Undead zombie army.    Milla Jovovich is still highly kick-ass in this role and she's rejoined with Ali Larter in this action-packed sequel.  Battling her way from a supposed safe-haven in Alaska, she makes her way to a prison where others have gathered for safety from the mob.  Twists and turns, shoot-outs and stuntwork will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the film.    Highly recommended, and from the looks of this, the producers are not about to give up on the Resident Evil theme, stand by for more sequels!
0061245097|5.0|Move over Mommy Dearest, Justina Crawfield may have just stolen your title as the worst mom in the history of the world. Because of her, and her undying hatred for vampires, her daughter Cat has spent the past four years without the love her life. At the end of [[ASIN:0061245089 Halfway to the Grave]], a military organization came to Cat and asked her to join their special unit, designed to fight vampires. That, or they would kill her vampire-lover, Bones. Cat would have just run off with Bones, but she knew Justina would never accept him and she would become a target for all of Cat's enemies. So Cat accepted the job and disappeared, leaving Bones with only a goodbye note.<br /><br />In the past four years, Cat has used her skills as a half-vampire to train a team.  And they're as close as family. But now, a new threat is on the scene. He wants Cat dead.. and only Bones can keep her safe. Of course, when they come together again, all the old magic is there, but with years of longing fueling their desires.  They make an explosive couple.  The sex is even more amazing this time around... My Goodness, Jeaniene Frost, you could make a reader blush.<br /><br />What's different about the first book in the series, is that now we are fleshing out some great secondary characters which become pivotal to the series: humans like Denise, Tate, Juan, & Don; our ghoul Rodney is back; and we've got vamps like Charles, Annette, & Ian. And let's not forget Cat's parents. Yes, parents with an \\"s.\\" You already know what I think of Justina; but dad Max is even worse. It's really a wonder that Cat turned out as well as she did.<br /><br />This was a great book. Most Paranormal Romances have a new couple with each edition, but Cat & Bones are strong enough to keep me glued to the page for as many books as Frost can churn out. This is a fabulous, fun, easy read --and a series I would recommend without reservation. 5 stars.
B003WTE886|5.0|As a true taylor fan i ran out to purchase the cd the day it came out. Taylor shocked me with a more grown up sound and more songs about boys that have broken her heart. The music in each of the songs is very well coordinated with the emotions she portrays in her lyrics. For example, Dear John is about her fling with john Mayer and how it ended so abrubtly. The instumentals in the beginning of the song sound like one of john mayer's songs which really makes you think about what shes trying to say. Each track has a different emotion behind it and she tells a story and once again, shows us that she is a strong girl that is learning as she goes. Shes also a good role model because she does not write about drugs sex and alcohol which i think is admirable for young girls who are her main audience. I give the Speak Now Cd five stars and three thumbs up!
B004NSULHM|5.0|The king of limbs is a great album, although it is a little short. It's less than 37 minutes! If you only love Radiohead from the early 90's then this album may not be for you. It's a continuation of electronica-type music, similar to the last several they've put out. As for me, I've been a Radiohead fan since I was 14, and I still love what they're putting-out. It's hard to say that about any other band. Keep `em coming guys!
B004HU6YZ4|4.0|Overall this is a solid effort.  Not what I was expecting though.  It has a bluesy, almost classic rock feel that is a little surprising considering the straight up rock sound on Sex Love and Rock n' Roll.  Although not as country and rockabilly influenced, this album is more reminiscent of Mike's solo work and less straight up driving punk rock. One of the things that I like about Social Distortion is that they are not afraid to evolve and shift direction as needed.  Apparently some people are disappointed this isn't as \\"punk rock\\" as the albums they put out 20 years ago, but hey, like someone else said, Mike is almost 50, and his song writing has evolved over the years.      There are a couple songs that I would have to write off as filler, but there are also some gems like \\"Gimme the Sweet and Lowdown\\" and \\"Take Care of Yourself\\" (bonus track).  I wouldn't put it up against the classic SD albums, but it is a solid album worth picking up.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is a good man movie that could also be enjoyed by women. Not appropriate for children under 14.  Full of suspence shows you don't have to give up when you are retired and put out to pasture. You could still do a good efficient job.

B004DK5CW4|2.0|This clumsy, cardboard  \\"Seabiscuit\\"-wannabe is a poor attempt to pull on the heartstrings of the millions of us who fell in love with Big Red in the summer of 1973.  His mind-boggling finish at The Belmont will never be repeated.  But that's about it for emotion in this film.  The passion is all left in the barn due to flat performances by everyone on screen (except the horses). What little pathos that exists in this yawner is, like the characters themselves, never well developed.  We don't learn to really love or hate (or even care for) anyone, including Secretariat's loud-mouthed antagonist or John Malkovich's clown-suited trainer character.      I'm stopping now because I just re-read Robert Horton's' editorial review (at the top of all reviews) and he is saying exactly what I'm saying -- but MUCH better.      Save your money on this one.  Re-rent and reread Seabiscuit and see what great storytelling looks like.  This ain't it.  Too bad, because Secretariat would have left Seabiscuit in the dust.  But not at the theater.
0743298039|5.0|Loved this book.  It took me on a very suspensful journey and kept me glued to the book from page one.  A must read.
B001FB5634|3.0|I would just like to offer, I am frustrated that along with barely marketing the film in the first place, the DVD is also barely marketed, and it is about as no frills as a DVD release can be. So little effort.  a Couple deleted scenes (Which to be honest, I could swear I saw in the theatrical release - which by the way I had to drive 60 miles to see) were included and that was about it.    No making of, just a complete lack of interesting additional features I am used to in a DVD release.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|It is unfortunate that the general public's psyche is so conditioned to films with special effects and shallow plot lines.  The American is an excellent film.  It IS an art house film.  The texture and quality of this film is very good.  The plot line and cinematography are high quality.  George Clooney's acting style in this film is perfect for the character he portrays.  If you have an ounce intellect and attention to fine film making, you will throughly enjoy this film.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|I saw The Sound of Music for the first time in the 60's. I have seen it almost every year since!! Absolutely my all time favorite movie. This addition certainly has made me feel as though I was watching it for the first time. The detail and clarity is amazing. I could not believe how great this DVD was. It will make viewing it again and again a welcomed pleasure. Look forward to seeing it more than once a year!!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The third season of the Big Bang Theory does not disapoint.  With a rare focus on scientific allusion, engaging characters and a unique perspective on the human condition this series is almost Pavlovian in its appeal.  And I mean that in the most favorable way.
1439181780|5.0|This book has changed my life :-) I recommend the audio version of this book for even a greater experience. Rhonda Byrnes has really matured spiritually since she wrote the secret. It is my opinion that you should not bother reading \\"The Secret\\", since the material in her second book,\\"The Power\\" goes way beyond that. If you want to create miracles in your life, I fully recommend it. Also, I recommend \\"Holding a Butterfly--An Experiment in Miracle-Making\\" by Lynn Woodland for a truly amazing experience :-)
B001EN71DQ|5.0|Of course it's amazing. and anyone who is like, \\"waaaaah, episodes 4-6 are soooo much better. i can't even watch the new ones.\\"   oh my god, stop the ridiculous whining. they're all great in their own way, and the fight scenes are incredible in 1-3. episode 3 is where it's at though for sure.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|the reason i read this book was that it was thick and i assumed that it would take me a while to read it. im twelve and it took my two days... i couldnt put it down. every moment was filled with... everything! i reccomended it to my mother and friends and they agreed that it was amazing.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|This movie IS \\"fantastic!\\" And Amazon did well, as usual, with getting the product to me in a timely fashion.
B000YENUI6|5.0|OK, if you read reviews about this film, you will find the comments range from \\"first class\\" to \\"terrible\\", so what is the truth.    Art is personal.  IMO, all are true.      IMO, this is a flawed film, with remarkable elements, definitely a film to be viewed, for those interested in film, interested in fine acting, interested in experiencing another social / criminal world, interested in a triller.      This film is not for the faint of heart.  It is very violent.  The strange thing is though, no guns, no chase scenes, no explosions, actually only several deaths, but with acting, filming, situations which make these scenes so memorable and frightening.
B001EN71DG|4.0|it is the awesome-ness that is star wars, but it does contain some stupid added scenes. there's a musical number with jabba that is completely ridiculus. but other than that, it's still great.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Blu-ray set has a ton of features that gets you really in-depth into the philosophy of the show.  Picture and sound quality are superb.  Really enjoyable experience.  Only gripe is that the season's didn't come in their own plastic cases, just paper boxes.  The blu-ray set is a definite own.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|This movie is awesome. Tons of special features, which I was really looking forward to. Received it in a timely manner.
0345528581|5.0|I bought this book to complement a small workout area in my basement, and I have been doing the exercises for about a month.  The author does a great job explaining in detail how to perform the exercises, as well as how to \\"step it up\\" for an even more difficult version of the same exercise.  There are many exercises in this book that I would have never even thought of...and ones that are deceptively difficult and very effective.  I highly recommend this book!
0061729078|4.0|A 1st hand trip report. Aldus, bringing his unique perspective to bear on the subject, gives us a clinical dissection of his mescaline trip.  Some of his statements vis a vis the pharmokinetics of mescaline may not have stood the test of time, but his approach to the subject is both novel and entertaining.    If you have any interest in the psychedelic experience, Aldus shares with us his subjective and objective insight on the subject, well worth the time it takes to read.
1592402690|5.0|You will get more genuine insight on the Beatles from this book than from any other (IMO).  Simply put, Emerick was there working along side the Beatles.      Almost all the other Beatles books were written by authors and fans - people who just collected facts and analyzed the Fab Four.  This book separates itself from those because it is written by an actual insider who WORKED WITH THE BEATLES and can give an EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT on the Beatles themselves.    I am amazed at the details Geoff Emerick spells out as he takes you through an autobiographical account on the making of various Beatles albums.  It is as if he kept a diary and is now sharing it with you.  His stories are filled with strong specifics and emotions that capture the time and events.    I really like Emerick's own perspectives on the Fab Four:  McCartney - The unquestioned leader in the studio and most talented musician  Lennon - The temperamental intellectual artist with great chaotic vision  Harrison - 2nd tier Beatle - always struggling on guitar, but eventually matured  Ringo - Not nearly as jovial as seen on camera - much more aloof    THE ONE CAVEAT is that Emerick also delves into the politics and recording processes at EMI (Abbey Road) Studios.  I find this to be just as interesting since I am a musician myself.  But if you are not fond of the technical aspects of how a song is made, then this may not be the best book for you.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I just got into this show & have watched all available seasons in about 2 weeks.  The show is FUNNY!!!! can't wait until season 4 comes out on DVD
B002GJU54E|5.0|I loved it. I was laughing out loud, many times. Please don't hate on Carl.<br />How can you go wrong with this book? I mean there's a fire farter! This is a really fun read.
B000JML7EC|5.0|I found the story to be very good and quick read.  The Kindle edition was well formatted.  Definitely recommended.
B004NFB4EO|1.0|I was able to let the single of \\"Alejandro\\" slide on TFM album. To me, it had remenants of ABBA's \\"Fernando\\" mixed with the 90's beat of another mega-Swede group, Ace of Base. It was something they definitely would have put out in their heyday.<br /><br />Now, you have this: I can see some resemblances to \\"Express Yourself\\" but more resemblances to \\"When Love Takes Over\\" by David Guetta (vocals by Kelly Rowland). It might come as a surprise to some Yanks who gobble LG's music like it a quarter pounder with extra cheese, but dance music isn't new, especially for someone who has lived in Europe (like myself). Not only do they have great DJs but great trance and dance artists (Kylie Minogue--an Aussie although she might as well be an honorary Brit--, Julie Thompson, Susana, Sophie Ellis-Bextor)and we have a few of our own (Jes immediately comes to mind and is ten times better than LG but she isn't known so pity for the \\"little\\" monsters).<br /><br />The message of the song is good, if somewhat unoriginal with hokey lines like \\"doesn't matter if you're black, white or beige\\" or \\"Gay, bi, lesbian, transgender\\" (sorry if I don't nail the lyrics word for word but I'm paraphrasing here).<br /><br />She is overhyped and no, she isn't the \\"best songwriter and singer out there\\" (her words, not mine, she gave them to an interviewer for the cover story she's doing for the March issue of Vogue magazine). In the States maybe but we no longer have the monopoly on good music. Most of the better stuff is coming out of Europe anyway but we are too busy living in our little cocoons, eating ourselves to death and too lazy to do more than shift our fat @sses from the television to our our 30-gallon tank SUVs to go to a drive-thru to see the forest for the trees.<br /><br />It might be a great song if you are a hardcore LG supporter but to most of us, it's just subpar and no, it doesn't even come close to former hits like \\"Bad Romance\\", \\"Telephone\\" or even \\"Paparazzi\\", \\"Just Dance\\" or \\"Poker Face\\". My opinion so please don't flame me. I represent myself only so there is no need to send me hate mail just because you disagree.don't flame me. I represent myself only so there is no need to send me hate mail just because you disagree.
0312944926|4.0|I finally got the chance to listen to this early Dan Brown novel. I liked the plot line a lot, we have enigmas, twists, and some interesting characters.     Brown has created an early prototype of the Tom Hanks character from the later books. Of course he is an erudite professor of minor topics (here obscure languages, later symbology), who is handsome, fit, and prone to wooing beautiful and smart women. For reasons that are clear only to the #2 man in the NSA, the professor is sent off to Spain on an important mission. At the same time a rogue computer programmer meets an early end. Most of the book deals with the professor searching for the programmer's personal effects in the hope to find a clue to terminate a computer virus. The programmer is a former NSA man, who was forced out due to his concerns about the agency's policies and power. The #2 man in the NSA turns out to be much more than we thought, his secret love for the beautiful head of cryptology (also the professor's girl) motivates him to ride a Trojan horse.  Fotunately the Director of NSA has a back door to manage this mess.  He shows up in time, takes over from his incompetent staff and sorts this out with only three seconds left before Armeggedon.       There are three fundamental problems with the book.  First it is not well written in places. Brown learned to write better in his later books but this thing is hard on the ear at spots, full of ridiculous analogies and similes. Secondly it is full of errors. Everyone around here knows who is the NSA. I am sure they have all the translators they need and don't bring in Georgetown professors on short notice. Perhaps the issue here is more how dated this book has become. Technology has passed Dan Brown by, perhaps he understands that as his more recent books dwell more on history than technology. Third the characters are dunces or completely un-neccessary.  We have chapters full of minutae about some assistants to the NSA directors and their affairs withhoney-dripped cafeteria workers. None of them do anything to solve the problem in the end. I was also yelling in the car as I listened to this, when no one in the whole US government knew the most basic facts about chemistry, needed to solve the passkey riddle.
0399230033|5.0|This is a great book for the 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 year range.  It is a classic, like Goodnight, Moon.  My little one at first loved finding the little mouse on each page and made tugging sounds for pulling the banana.  Later, he liked to unlock each cage with hand twisting and little clicking sounds.  He advanced to finding and waving byebye to the balloon and moon.  An absolute favorite!
0679745203|2.0|A lyrically written book, with I feel, no great substance (and not much humour either). The characters (four of them) are not very convincing. How this book could be compared to `All Quiet on the Western Front' is beyond me as they are entirely different stories (this was cited in one of the comments in my edition). The author skips endlessly from one time sequence to another time sequence - as if he cannot hold a thought for more than a few pages. This out of sequence style strikes me as contrived. There are nice sentences thrown together but little cohesion.<br /><br />At the end the author lists his sources. It is as if he read the sources and used these to try to inspire a novel - about deserts and dismantling bombs.
B003Q6D25K|1.0|Skip this tedious sequel. It's all filler, and the ending IS THE SAME AS PARANORMAL ACTIVITY!   I only spent a dollar on the rental, and I consider it wasted.  The only 'plus' is that there is much less shaky camera work than in the original PA.  Bloated, boring, and unnecessary. Just watch the original again.
B004HYDL1K|1.0|a (very) bad imitation of the camp tarantino faux trailer...much nudity, implied sex, and gore, as anticipated...starts modestly bad and then descends from there...bob deniro, who once smote a director in an angry parle re. his voicing of a car ad (\\"i don't sell cars\\")...could not have been worse off than this...seagal continues to accept anything that is offered to him, no matter how low; thus his presence is unsurprising...i was not expecting an actual plotline, just lots of empty action...unfortunately a subplot is introduced in which a \\"network\\" \\"helps\\" illegal mexicans to \\"settle\\" in the us, and then \\"do their part\\"...excuse me, but an illegal alien does not HAVE a part...as it is, about 400 THOUSAND children born on us soil to illegal aliens are granted automatic citizenship via a very disfigured interpretation of the 14th amendment...that's 4 million each decade, which is 1 1/2 million more than the entire population of the us in 1776...this country has to decide whether it is to be the orphanage of the world (and one of its leading slave states, as these \\"settled\\" people will substitute very well for east asians) or close its gates and cultivate its own...i know this is a political harangue, and i hate digressing into them, but dudes, so is the flik.
B00005JN8Z|4.0|This 1951 epic movie caught me completely off guard.  I knew what to expect of the acting, melodramtic theatre.  However, I didn't expect the story to be so historically fulfilling. This movie is set in a period of history that sees the mad roman emperor Nero, living the life of a powerful Caesar. He's not the brightest of leaders, so he surrounds himself with advisors who are influential in all his decisions, both good and bad. He comes across as a fool, and like any fool in power, Nero doesn't disappoint. He burns, he blames and he throws to the lions those who threaten his role as Caesar.<br /><br />The easily influenced Nero dangerously wields his power like a child playing with fire.  You know that sooner or later he'll burn himself.  It is rumored early in the movie that Nero had his mother and wife murdered. The citizens of Rome seem to be in a love/hate relationship with their leader.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable movie with plenty of action. The moving faith of early Christianity is well represented here by Peter and Paul. Love plays a leading role in this movie, however it is the love of Christians for their Lord and Savior that upstages the loves of men and women.  It was definitely a time well spent watching this movie.
B000SX88VW|4.0|Seriously...<br /><br />It's a great album. Classic Floyd. But hey...<br /><br />It's $7.99 to download the whole album, right?<br /><br />Wait a minute...<br /><br />There're five songs on the album priced at $.99 each - do the math - $.99 x 5 = $4.95!<br /><br />If you download each song individually, you'll get the whole album for less than five bucks!<br /><br />*LOL* Hope this helps! ;)<br /><br />##############<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Amazon's changed the price of purchasing the whole MP3 album to $4.95 - which kind of makes this advice irrelevant now... :)<br /><br />###############<br /><br />Updated Update:<br /><br />Now three of the five songs are marked as \\"album only\\", which makes my earlier advice impossible.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Although an adult for many years now, I never took a fancy to Adult Contemporary style music, and thus, this album disappointed me. You see, I first came to know Dire Straits through their stellar album Brothers In Arms, (recorded some years after Making Movies): one of the greatest overall musical offerings of the 1980s in my opinion. Musically, that album was Rock n Roll, Alternative, New Wave, Honky Tonk, and a host of other styles thrown in for good measure. Still, BIA could legitimately be classified as rock, whereas Making Movies cannot. Sorry, but the one track \\"solid rock\\" nowithstanding, rock it ain't. Perhaps if Amazon's product page were to have been more clear on what genre to expect of MM, I wouldn't have been so mislead.    Nonetheless, my confusion doesn't warrant giving this album any less than 5 stars as it *is* beautifully crafted music. Truthfully, MM has some of the best-composed tracks--and fabulous remastering--that I've ever heard. Just don't be fooled that you're getting *rock n roll* by most common definitions.
B004NSULHM|3.0|I downloaded the full resolution WAV file version of \\"The King of LImbs\\" this morning and have given it one uninterrupted listen through so far. My first and immediate impression is - underwhelmed. Not at all what I expected or hoped far. I'm not saying I don't like it necessarily, but really I think it could have been released as a Thom Yorke solo album.   If you liked \\"Kid A\\", this will be your cup of tea. Barely even a hint of electric guitar/bass or real drums. So, like I'm sure most expected, it's not a rock-band album at all.  There's some pretty cool \\"O.K. Computer\\"-ish electric guitar on \\"Little by LIttle\\", acoustic guitar on \\"Give Up the Ghost\\", bass guitar, a little meandering electric guitar, and some real-sounding looped drums on \\"Separator\\", but that's about it. Nothing ever rises above a medium intensity or a medium tempo. I would venture to say you could play this at the rest home and not even get anyone to look up from their chicken noodle soup. I can't think of a better album if you wanted to do a shot of heroin and just kick back. I'd be very careful about listening to it while driving.   Thinking back on it, every song sounds like an intro that you expect to kick into an amazing song at any moment, but it never does. It's riki-tiki drum loop, ambient pad and bed, echoey voice-voice-voice-voice, looplooploop, ritki-tiki drums, more ambient bed, end. Well produced: yes. Well written: I guess. Memorable: no.   Eight songs, a little over thirty seven minutes long. Overall I'd put it maybe fourth or fifth in my ranking of Radiohead albums. LIke most of their stuff, I'm sure it'll grow on me as I listen to it. Believe me, I wasn't just looking for another \\"O.K. Computer\\", but I also wasn't looking for another \\"Kid A\\".
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Reading Dickens was hard at first, but he is a wonderful story teller.  Get over the old language and enjoy the story.<br /><br />I have heard and seen many tellings of A Christmas Carol but none do the justice of the original wording.
B004F4HWNU|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time in my life yesterday... and I must say, it was very difficult to watch without shedding some tears.    I felt soo much \\"Compassion\\" and energy while watching this movie that I can't help but become more appreciative of everyone and everything in my life.
B0027VTMAE|3.0|Thriller/detective movie - (I like that genre) - dealing with the occult/devil (good so far) - the movie is ok, nothing special.  If you watch this expecting to see a good movie, you will be disappointed.  Its not terrible, and if you have low expectations it will be fine.    The bad guys are pretty pathetic, they kind of remind me of B movie characters from the 60's.  I liked the concept of the 3 sets of diagrams in 3 books.

B003M0H4NG|5.0|This is probably the finest moment in Miles Davis career, though I personally prefer On the Corner because it's more of a combination of funk, jazz and rock.  Bitches Brew is more like 80% jazz and 20% rock.     Look, I honestly have no idea how to appreciate a jazz album of this magnitude.  It's loaded with so many fragmented saxophone jams, swirling keyboard solos and heavy drumming that it's honestly too tough of a task for me to describe the songs in detail.  At the moment, they all sound the same.      But concerning how to just get *into* such an enormously detailed album such as this?    Simple- put one song on repeat, listen to it about 20 times in a row, then move on to the next song and repeat the same process.  Continue the entire process until the album is complete.   It's the only way the human mind can truly remember the sophisticated sequence of saxophone notes that, I assume, is the reason Bitches Brew excels in the complexity and listenability department.      Historically this is the ultimate jazz album, and supposedly one that even rock fans such as myself can admire.  At the current moment however, I don't have the desire to take my own advice and listen to the entire album 20 times in a row.  I can only assume that paying extremely close attention to the saxophone will reveal either melodic note sequences or at the very least, create an atmosphere appropriate enough to understand how to comprehend the enormous complexity of this recording.    It is good though, make no mistake about it.
B00275EHJG|5.0|As a parent I frequently watch more children's shows than adult shows.  However, many of them I actually enjoy.  The Toy Story series is one of them.  Compared to the other two movies this one is darker, and not up to the same level as of quality as the other two.  Pixar has set the standard so high that even they struggle to maintain it.  This is a quality movie though and if you loved the series don't miss this one.

B000UJCALI|5.0|One of Stanley Kubrick's masterpieces featuring the incomparable Jack Nicholson, the story itself is well known so I'll not dwell on it, this particular edition with the bonus disk featuring some out takes and production notes is a treasure.  The location, the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park Co. about an hour out of Denver opened in 1909, built by F.E. and F.O. Stanley (Stanley Steamer), opulent, luxurious, breathtaking in conjunction with the surrounding country there just are not enough superlatives in English to accurately describe it. The movie really doesn't do the location justice but it gives you a glimpse of the grandeur, the hotel itself comes with plenty of supernatural tales in it's own right and management takes full advantage of this in a very artistic manner.<br /><br />I had the good fortune to play piano at the Stanley during the season of '70 so it is a highly significant re visitation for me. Should you ever have the opportunity to visit the Stanley Hotel take full advantage of it, meanwhile you may visit it vicariously with this video package as I do.<br /><br />As always in my experience, Amazon.com once again delivers the goods exactly as represented and three days ahead of schedule and at an outstanding value, Thank You!
B003PIUBZS|4.0|As someone who loves period pieces, this series seemed right up my alley. I loved Gladiator, Rome etc and own both DVDs.  I love a man with a sword.  I was ,however, initially disappointed here. The actors were clearly a new cast trying to find their footing, the dialogue was painful and the storyline unimaginative and predictable. Still I dragged myself to the tv every Friday night at 10 to watch what my bf alternatively called, 'Spartacrap' and 'Crapacus'.  Say what you will but I am a woman who loves her blood and gore. And there is ALOT of it here. Unlike other reviews, the heavy handed blood spewing didn't bother me, nor did the very graphic sex scenes. I loved the fight sequences, even yes, the slo-mo body slams and Troy-type over the shield spear stabbings.<br /><br />Somewhere around episode 4 though, things came together and whoa nelly!  This was what I had been hoping for from the beginning!  The actors settle in, the storyline picks up and the characters are fleshed out.  I literally raced to the tv at the appointed time every Friday.  I will say that the dialogue remains heavy handed. For some reason, characters in other shows (Rome etc) don't sound 'unnaturally'  like they're from another time period, and I'm not sure why the writers perpetuate that here.  You can literally see the actors trying to wrap their mouths around the awkward wording.  BUT that is the only flaw.  Spartacus is, of course, the main attraction and Andy Whitfield does an awesome job. Lucretia and Battiatus are the power couple we at times love to hate, but whose love and committment to each other humanize them in a way their actions outside the ludus don't.  Asher we respect for his survival instincts but wouldn't turn our backs on, Doctore is loved and admired, Crixus is the gladiator who lives for glory, and the rivalry between him and Spartacus is a major theme.  Underlying all of this is Spartacus' pride, his refusal to fight and eventual capitulation, and his undying desire to be reunited with his wife.  As we follow the weekly twists, turns, double crossings and backstabbings we are drawn into these characters and come to care for the House of Battiatus.<br /><br />For those who say there's no story line, I'm not sure what show they're watching. There are multiple stories happening at once, more than enough to hold our interest...and the season finale...THE FINALE...is just something that cannot be wiped from my memory.<br /><br />So stick with it.  It gets better, much better.  And the prequel, 'Gods of the Arena' is even better still!ited with his wife.

B00008OLYN|5.0|This CD is stunning. I have listened to a far vast wide range of music and this CD is simply amazing. This Opeth CD is one where i can close my eyes and see my childhood, teen years, and adult years mesh perfectly.  It takes my away and gives me peace when the world makes me fed up with everything. Each song is a deep journey, the melody's, lyrics, guitar solo's, bass solo's, and organs are perfect.   Opeth is known to have 1 song in each CD to take you to that deep dark place where you can be in solitude and find yourself when society takes its toll on you, in this CD you'll find EACH song does that exact thing.   So if your into relaxing to a great metal band that knows how to bring true emotion and pure talent to the table then pull up a chair and enjoy Opeth's Damnation is for you.
B0029ATTAQ|5.0|\\"1984\\" remains one of the most important books, ever written.  If you've read it, may I also suggest Orwell's \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" and his \\"Collected Essays\\".  \\"1984\\", like most films, can not do complete justice to the book in a limited time frame; Nevertheless, it is a wonderful rendition of the book's intent.  John Hurt, Richard Burton and the rest of the cast are excellent; Michael Radford's direction is economical and powerful.  As others, have indicated \\"1984\\" is a film classic.  Sadly, viewers in the U.S. have to find important films or non-abridged films, (e.g., \\"Body and Soul\\" with John Garfield), outside the U.S.  Recently, I picked up this good copy of \\"1984\\", (the Japanese DVD), from Amazon.  It is in English audio and you can just turn the subtitles \\"off\\".  (For whatever the reason, you still can't get it at Netflix.)  Also problematic is that the DVD price has been climbing needlessly high, and I feel lucky to have, recently, found a reasonably priced copy from Amazon Marketplace.  While some viewers might feel that the society Orwell presents, \\"can't happen or is unrealistic\\", the fact is, that it already has happened and continues to take place from religious fanatics who would burn our books and films that they find sinful, to and the daily, \\"propaganda\\" of Rupert Murdoch's news empire and the global corporations that dominate our world.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Just getting into season 3 right now through AMC Wednesdays late night encores being re-broadcast. Didn't even pay attention to this show or mistakenly ignored it when it originally aired years ago on AMC. I am amazed that Cranston transforms his mildly quirky comical mannered father (Hal) from \\"Malcom in the Middle\\" fame again to another fatherly role (Walter) that may have typecast him into TV syndication genre forever. Yet this similar role in new surrounding heightens Cranston's abilities to again take the father role and take it into the stratosphere with his characters desire for survival. With the twisting plots and story lines, Cranston delves into a more gruesome set of tragic circumstances, some by his own decisions and external influences of survival, delivering new sets of instincts he never utilized before.  The key to this series is watching it in order, many subplots and small facets of the story surface several episodes later. As most of these episodes cannot stand on their own if you just watched one, or watched them out of order. The cinematic dramatic effects are very addictive, sometimes showing the end result at the beginning of an episode makes you want to watch where the plot will lead you to. Or introducing new characters and wondering to yourself how will this tie to the plot. This show is not for the faint of heart, the producers know this. Probably the most gruesome scene in this entire this series for me was the apartment bedroom scene where the dead character of Jane Margolis is being picked up by the dutiful, yet efficient, city coroner crew. Not a bloody or moment of gory essence, this tragic scene parlays boundless energetic personality with unlimited potential, transformed to a tensile static core, with her open eyes helplessly staring out for the unrealized horizon, haunted by that last mistake. Not many TV shows have thrown down the gambit of storytelling like Breaking Bad, yet this show keeps evolving and entering new heights of realism, tragedy, and the will to survive no matter what the cost.
B002N4DZ58|5.0|A midprice reissue of the 2005 headliner, this set is still a treasure trove. It's not only Placido Domingo's long-awaited crack at a role he'd been approaching and avoiding for decades, it's an original, valid, long overdue, and genuinely moving reinterpretation of this disturbing masterwork.<br /><br />What do I mean? Well, as the admired British critic John Steane once wrote, Wagner himself \\"is said to have constantly urged his interpreters to sing in the Italian manner.\\" And what does this manner entail? Steane again: \\"smoothness of line, beauty of tone, and elegance of technical accomplishment.\\" Handed the reins by EMI, Covent Garden music director Antonio Pappano has, at long last, set about giving us nothing less than bel canto Wagner.<br /><br />You hear it from the outset of the Act I prelude -- the strings are warm and burnished, spin a continuous singing line, crescendo in arcs from the brink of inaudibility, then taper back into silence on phrase endings. And when the young sailor (Rolando Villazon in luminous voice) sings his love ditty, similar principles apply: long-breathed legato, mastery of a wide dynamic range (including echo effects and well-supported soft singing), and eager articulation of the text.<br /><br />Clearly this is official directorial policy, because much the same can be said of every cast member here. Mihoko Fujimura's lyric mezzo traces Brangaene's lines with unusual delicacy and variety, perfectly in tune, finely focused, floating her high notes (\\"Welcher Wahn!\\" in I iii is sweetly nurturing, the Watch in II ii marvelously ethereal). As for Isolde, here the set serves instant notice that it isn't a Domingo ego trip but a whole-souled effort to do the work justice. Nina Stemme hasn't Fujimura's floated high notes (she sustains her pianissimo F sharp at the close of \\"Mild und leise\\" by discreetly widening the vibrato), but she has everything else: imaginative phrasing, gleaming tone, on-the-dot tuning, steady emission, well-knit scale, soaring top, melting legato (\\"Ich bin's, ich bins\\" in III ii is heartrending). Within seconds of her first entrance it's clear she's the real thing: she piles hair-raisingly into \\"Hoert meinen Willen\\" and you realize she's as accomplished an Isolde as we've had since the seventies.<br /><br />Our two low-voiced leads aren't on this level but still have plenty to offer. Olaf Baer's lovely baritone is undersized and thin on the bottom for the rambunctious Kurwenal, but he really sells his taunting ballad and is sensitive and affecting throughout Act III. As for Rene Pape, his mellifluous basso cantate is choice casting for King Marke, though his forte top notes are chancier than they were on the Met DVD. But with Pappano's encouragement, his line readings are more probing and he manages a marvel of hushed poignancy at \\"Da kinderlos.\\" Plus we sense the conductor's fine Italian hand even with the bit players: they all display this same balance of smooth legato and pointed articulation of the words -- e.g., the intimate delivery and silver sound of Ian Bostridge's shepherd, or Jared Holt's split-second ability to make a fearsome figure of Melot through ringing tone, energetic phrasing, and a telling subito piano at \\"ob ich mein Haupt.\\"<br /><br />And now the set's reason for being. There's no percentage in quibbling over Domingo's Tristan -- the voice is in excellent working order -- or in chiding him for not tackling the part onstage -- tenors who do seem not to enjoy long careers (Hofmann, Thomas, Jerusalem, Kollo, even Windgassen; Melchior doesn't count because he sang a drastically abridged and simplified version). But in the studio the role's characteristic high notes (A flat, A) aren't a problem, Domingo's bronze timbre aptly suggests Tristan the warrior, his soft singing is firmly supported and never crooned or declaimed (unlike the maverick Vickers), and he partners Stemme gallantly (in the duet passages of \\"O sink hernieder,\\" they pitch the tricky intervalswith breathtaking ease and accuracy). His could well be the most thoroughly SUNG Tristan in Wagner history -- yet, like the rest of the company, he's also alert to verbal and theatrical values, sardonically relishing the consonants at \\"seines flackernden Lichtes fluechtige Blitze,\\" almost spooky at \\"Dem Land, das Tristan meint,\\" downright bloodcurdling during his curse on the \\"furchtbarer Trank.\\" Again, there's no percentage in quibbling -- this Tristan is intelligent, poetic, emotionally open, vocally qualified, musically immaculate, and desperately needed. In short, it's a genuinely significant piece of work and a fitting capstone to an extraordinary career.<br /><br />As suggested, the Covent Garden orchestra is another eloquent factor. First violins come from your left speaker, seconds from your right, instantly clarifying the polyphony. Tempos are fleet yet cleanly executed, so nothing seems rushed. And in a crunch this band has no problem exchanging bel canto lyricism for crushing power: they're thrilling in the runup to Tristan's entrance in II ii, gut-wrenching with the famous discord that interrupts \\"O ew'ge Nacht.\\"<br /><br />The stereo sonics are warm, airy, and wide-ranging, locating events with exceptional variety and specificity between the two speakers.<br /><br />So how does this new set stack up against the competition? Remarkably, I'd say. Despite monaural sound and variable vocalism, the 1952 Furtwaengler set remains a classic, with the 1966 Boehm another standard recommendation and the 1982 Kleiber a more recent favorite -- but for today's consumers, Pappano's is the most vibrantly recorded, appealingly sung, and immediately communicative performance available in stereo.<br /><br />Includes a bonus disk with libretto and translation. As before, fervently recommended.y).

B004DWKO8Y|5.0|The long awaited reunion cd from this great band with all 4 original members! After seeing the band reunite and tour a couple years back,it was great news to hear they were going into the studio to record a brand new cd. And...here it is! What If.. is filled with everything you've always loved about the band: Martin's superb vocals (which haven't lost a step),Gilbert's exceptional 'guitar god' playing,Sheehan's hands down untouchable bass flourishes,and Torpey's rock solid backbeat (take a good listen to Pat's playing here--WOW!!!). There are some standout tracks here,but the entire cd is VERY strong--surely one of the band's best efforts ever. One minor piccodillo--skip track 3 (Stranger In My Life),and perhaps place it at the end of the cd. It's badly placed as a slower/ballady song at track 3. This may enhance the 'flow' of the disc for you. All in all--a fanTAStic new release from these unsung heroes! Get it and enjoy! T     PS: I have the japanese version with the bonus track-Kill Me With A Kiss. I may have to get the US copy with Unforgiven as the sample for it sounds great as well.

B004NSULHM|2.0|In my opinion, a minimalistic tribal experience that is as short on vibrant charm as it is as short in length. I am used to the undeniably talented way Radiohead stick together as a band but this has none of the usual coaction. Instead it may as well be a continuation of Thom's work within his solo album The Eraser. I felt the reliance upon digital drum loops fed off the success of similar sounding tracks they had produced in the past and was almost abused track after track leaving me with a sense that experimentation and diversity had gone out the window with this album. There was a noticeable lack of guitar as well as no emotively driven vocal melodies.     I particularly enjoyed Kid A and the progression out of a sense for rock'n'pop was welcoming to my ears as the band took new and more experimental measures to guarantee a continuation of not only a growth within their capabilities but also as a way of furnishing gratification upon their crowd who constantly expect more. Having said this I honestly feel this album has gone too far and neglects the interests of certain fans. The Radiohead exhilaration is dead and all that is left is a distant and undefinable sound that may as well be a minimalist remix.       The only notable track for me was Separator.

B0046MOVD0|3.0|Personally I don't like 3D movies which is why I waited for the blu-ray/dvd release. The storyline is lacking a little and when one monster from the video game came into the picture I kept wondering why he came into the picture because there is no explanation why that creature is in the picture. The action is great which is why I give 3 stars but the all the effects are for 3D and hince it means to fully enjoy go out and buy a 3D tv and ready 3D Blu-ray player. The ending is kind of shot but other than that, I say it's best to end it here because I think after the 3rd they ran out of ideas.

I got it a couple of months ago and have watched many of the episodes several times!  Also great deal getting it on Amazon-way off the list price.  Definitely worth the money for the amount of entertainment you get!  The only complaint I have is that I watch DVDs when I go to sleep and there is a loop of theme song when the video finishes playing through.
0545140323|5.0|Penny Lane Bloom is done with boys. Love might be all you need, but Penny has her doubts. Especially when the dating pool is limited to the losers, players, jerks and wannabes otherwise known as the male population of McKinley High School.<br /><br />After a summer romance gone wrong once again leaves Penny miserable because of a guy she decides to call it quits. No more boys. No more dating. At least until the end of high school. Taking inspiration from the only men who never let her down, Penny decides to start her own anti-dating club: The Lonely Hearts Club, total members: one.<br /><br />But when her friends join and the girls at school hear about the Club, Penny finds herself at the center of attention as news of her stance on boys and her club spread throughout the school.<br /><br />As Penny builds a community of strong, capable girls she might even realize that some boys--even if they aren't John, Paul, George, or Ringo--might be okay (and maybe even worth dating) in The Lonely Hearts Club (2010) by Elizabeth Eulberg.<br /><br />Everything about Eulberg's debut novel* The Lonely Hearts Club is charming from the cover to the delightful plot, not to mention the Beatles motif throughout the novel.<br /><br />Penny is a clever, authentic narrator. Readers will love her frank tone and her humility as her Club morphs from an angry declaration against all boys to an important force for good at her high school. Penny's journey throughout the story both as leader of the Lonely Hearts Club and as a girl who has been burned by one too many boys is realistic and well-written.<br /><br />What really sets this book apart and makes it so wonderful is that the book is literally filled with strong female characters. In fact, that's kind of the whole point as Penny and the other Club members learn to focus on themselves and put their own interests first instead of focusing on boys. In short The Lonely Hearts Club is really the perfect blend of old fashioned girl power feminism and romantic sentiment. (And it's really fun and includes tons of Beatles references besides!)<br /><br />*Previously the mastermind behind publicity for the Twilight books (and lots of other titles you would recognize), Eulberg wrote this book in 2010. She followed it up with Prom and Prejudice in 2011. She also recently announced that she was planning on pursuing her writing career full time which, as a fan of her work, is extremely exciting!<br /><br />Possible Pairings: Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan, A Little Wanting Song by Cath Crowley, Prom and Prejudice by Elizabeth Eulberg**, Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine, The Boy Book by E.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|The best trilogy in MY opinion is the original trilogy (1977-83). The latest trilogy just completes the chapters and hopefully Lucas does not play (as in add any CG effects) with the Original Trilogy but if he adds some to the recent 3 it will work. I'm looking forward to it all, the movies, deleted scenes, bonus features. The thing to consider is that not all movies pre-HD era turn out as crisp as we would hope, a few i watched just looked liked their DVD counter parts only a bit more brighter in contrast. Nevertheless I'm taking a dive into spending the amount for the entire collection. If you had difficulties following i suggest go back and watch them, i did this past fall and fell in love with the (original trilogy) all over again. For those who do NOT like SciFi movies or found the gold in these movies, it's okay, borrow from a friend or get them from Netflix, anyway you can, indulge yourself in the Star Wars realm. Lucas did a fantastic job of combining all elements of other movies and relevance to historic figures and eras very well.

1416955070|1.0|I am a teenager and I love reading and writing fantasy. With that said, one may expect I would like this book. No, not at all. I had to force my way through this book and I still didn't get to the last chapter and epilogue (Why should I? I know how this is going to end). The characters are unsympathetic and unlikable. The plot often progressed because one or more characters were holding the Idiot Ball. The writing is just plain bad.    Our heroine, Clarissa (Clary) Fray, is one of the book's worst characters. She is headstrong and is determined to save everyone herself. Her loyalties change at the drop of a hat. She's described as being an average girl and yet her love interest says she's beautiful (I assume the Idiot Ball was in his possession at the time). Oh, and she's a very talented artist. And we're supposed to like Clary throughout the entire book, and the following books.  The rest of the characters aren't any better. Jace is a narcissistic jerk and yet Clary is smitten for him. The author loves describing his looks in every possible kind of light. Over and over she talks about his golden hair and golden eyes and how the moonlight makes it paler and the sunlight makes it goldener blah blah blah.  The villain is nothing more than a cardboard cutout. Basically, he wants to commit the genocide of anything that isn't human. Why? Because the author willed it to be!    Plot? I thought there was some in chapter one. Nope. The story starts with Clary seeing some teenagers about to kill another. Clary is told by the author to follow. She finds out the killers are Shadowhunters and the kid they killed was actually a demon, and the demon *had* to be killed because demons are Always Chaotic Evil. The Shadowhunters are the invisible saviors of everyday humans. The hunters are surprised to find out that Clary can see them and thus decide to put a stop to the plot by dropping a load of exposition on you and our blissfully ignorant protagonist. The plot is moved once againbecause someone decides to do something stupid, illogical, or unnatural.  Plot twists? Yeah, right. This book is painfully predictable. *\\"SPOILER\\" Alert* In part 1, we find out Clary's mom was married to the bad guy. \\"Clary, I am your father!\\" is what I heard in the distance. Then we find out one of the Hunters, Jace, is the son of the bad guy too. WHOA! The author blew me away with that one! Yeah, right.  *End of \\"SPOILER\\" Alert*    The writing itself is distracting. Characters shout in all-caps. Every page has at least two similes, many of them sounding forced. The endless descriptions get in the way of the plot. Paragraph breaks are often used improperly. The author often uses them when there is a time skip of 2 seconds, and often in the middle of dialogue. You will also notice that the author even divides this book into parts, and often in the middle of dialogue. And as I've said, there are a lot of long, drawn-out passages of exposition and backstory. There is even a full chapter where the point of view switches from 3rd person limited to 1st person view of a supporting character. And he tells you absolutely everything that was already dropped throughout the story. But wait, there's more! The characters even reiterate what was said in the chapter before!  Yes, it's a debut book, but one with lazy writing and lazy editing. Maybe she will improve, but I will make sure I avoid anything else with her name on it.    But if you have a high tolerance for bad fantasy, maybe you will like this.

6305657947|4.0|I don't mind stories where one of the main characters is smarter than the cops, but Renee Russo's character is arrogant beyond belief.  Her snarky smile and the \\"I told you so\\" grins are a bit much.<br /><br />She bypasses police protocol and without any real authority piques Crowne's attitude and interest that he is now a suspect in the art heist.  Faye Dunaway in the original (who also plays a cameo as a snarky psychiatrist who laughs at her own patients in this film) was the insurance investigator but was also playing by the rules.  Renee's Ms. Banning is a smart ass and not a very good insurance investigator at that, despite a few lucky guesses.<br /><br />Russo starts to crack as Crowne drags her out -- a few jealous moments, some betrayal -- but heck, she's not that attractive, even with her clothes off!<br /><br />Peter Brosnan plays a financier who plans art heists just because he can, but unlike Steve McQueen in the original, Peter underplays it all.<br /><br />Strange scenes:  she steals his keys and then makes copies.  then she and her boys essentially break into Crowne's house.  since they have no warrant, any evidence would not be admissible, so what's the point?  Crowne out-smarts her and we hear strains of \\"Windmills of Your Mind\\" which is cute (the theme song from the original) but really now!<br /><br />Russo, when she does break down, is not all that strong after all and that's really too bad.  The ending is a bit happier than the original, however.<br /><br />I will give the movie props for a decent soundtrack and some homage to the original film.  There are similar scenes from the original where Crowne and Banning go off to take glider rides and so on, but there's not the drawn-out scenes like in the McQueen film (thank goodness!).<br /><br />Other Brosnan Films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000ICM5V2 James Bond Ultimate Edition - Vol. 3 (GoldenEye / Live and Let Die / For Your Eyes Only / From Russia With Love / On Her Majesty's Secret Service)]]<br />[[ASIN:B0009NZ30A The Heist]] (similar scene to the \\"bowler hat\\" scene in The Thomas Crowne Affair.)<br /><br />Other Rene Russo Films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000KC8KGO Charlie Rose with Pierce Brosnan; Rene Russo (August 5, 1999)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000053VAG Buddy]]\\"bowler hat\\" scene in The Thomas Crowne Affair.)

B002M2N9JI|4.0|Great album.  Good songwriting.  I think the vocals are excellent.  I you're into 80s electronic music along the lines of Erasure (but with a female singer), you'll probably like this.  Some really catchy songs on here, Bulletproof being the top for me.    Definitely a fun, poppy, danceable album.    If you like this album, I also recommend checking out some of the remixes for fon twists on the songs here.

1595141715|5.0|13 reasons why by Jay Asher  Reviewed by Moirae the fates book reviews    Jay Asher's brilliant first novel is a moving, highly original story that focuses on a set of audiotapes made by a girl before she committed suicide, and which explain to 13 people the reasons why she decided to end her life. Told in a highly effective duel narrative -- alternating between the girl s voice and the thoughts of a boy who is listening -- this honest, poignant story reveals how other people's actions shape, and by extension can ruin, an individual's faith in people. Intensely powerful and painfully real, Thirteen Reasons Why reveals how brutal high school can be, the consequences of spreading rumors, and the lasting effects of suicide on those left behind. (Synopsis provided by goodreads)    This is a very serious book with a very serious topic. It's a book that should be read by people of all ages. I think it is a very powerful book, it's now the second time I have read it.  I have seen some people that say they hate the book and think it absolves Hannah of any wrong doing and places the blame solely on the 13 people. I think this is all a matter of perception. In the book, Clay doesn't think Hannah is trying to absolve herself, nor does Hannah.   She was merely saying that the peoples action helped her make the decision. I didn't think that the author was condoning suicide at all.   This is a very well written book and one of the best young adult novels I have ever found. I would strongly encourage everyone to read it and take the message to heart, what we say and do to one another can have a profound effect on another person's life.    Overall rating  ***** 5 out of 5 stars  Cover art:  I liked it with Hannah staring into the distance.  Obtained  My local library

B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Creating recognizable models is not a skill everybody has, but if you have some friends that are clever and somewhat visually oriented you can have a pretty good time with this game. The game comes with 3 sets of cards; easy, medium and hard.    The easy cards would be likely doable by just about anyone over the age of 7. The medium are a fair bit harder and could give the average adult a run for his money and the hard throw some pretty challenging subjects at you.    I highly recommended the \\"one builder\\" game mode with everybody else getting only one guess. This gives the builder more of a chance to make a visually worthwhile model than the other game modes.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|This film is so enjoyable! I wish that I'd purchased it sooner, so I could see it over and over (for 2 extra months).  One of the best lesbian films that I've seen.  Everything by Nicole Conn I've totally enjoyed, and this one is no exception.
0316044695|5.0|Even the most peace-loving Christian has to respect the dedication of these fine young men and the brutal training for which they enthusiastically volunteer.  Most young men need a challenge; it is hard to imagine a tougher one than you will experience vicariously in this book. The men, the Petty Officers, the Chiefs, and the junior Officers in this story, our country could not ask for better. Even the senior Officers are great leaders. I just wish they could have kept Marcus and his fellows from being squandered as they unfortunately were. Seals do not sugar-coat anything; let us not do so. These men were squandered. Why? A huge, slow, hovering helicopter packed with men sent to rescue Marcus and his fellows was blown out of the sky by a Russian rocket-propelled grenade, fifty year old technology. WHO the HELL didn't see that one coming?  Hello? Anyone remember the Russians in Afghanistan? Sorry, but a flag officer should have fallen on his sword for that one. Figuratively speaking. Of COURSE Seals rescue their own; nothing is more important. But rescue is one thing; suicide is another. Proper planning prevents piss poor performance and all that. I am no military historian but how about some covering or suppressing fire for that flying barn?  Or some white phosphorous or napalm or some tear gas or whatever it takes? How about another way to get rescuers where they are needed? Parachutes? No, I DON'T know the answer, but someone in the chain of command should have.   The moral dilemma Marcus and his men faced when they captured three goat herds: was that really unexpected? Had their officers NEVER prepared them for such an event? HELLO? I am NOT second-guessing Marcus and his men; I would not have second-guessed them if they had killed the three in cold blood. As a citizen, I am very angry and extremely disappointed that Seal officers did not foresee such a possibility and prepare their men properly. Plastic handcuffs? Duct tape? Drugs? I am an old man sitting at mycomputer and I thought of three possibilities. Why didn't senior officers think of these and more and then PREPARE? A flag officer and several other senior officers  should have resigned for that blunder alone. Last, we come to the original mission? Snatch a Taliban leader from a village. He has 70 to 140 men with AK47s and RPGs, the cheap and plentiful Russian weapons of angry peasants everywhere. Four, count 'em four, Seals. No air support was mentioned; WAS there any? Yes, Seals are awesome fighting machines. But what about worst case planning for 140 enemy who know their own land intimately?  The worst cased happened; 140 enemy ambushed the four Seals. So...call for backup but the radio didn't work. An officer has to sacrifice his life to call for help WITH HIS CELL PHONE! He gets through! Whoever made that radio, maintained it, and sent those men into battle with it should be shot! Figuratively. Maybe. You send hideously out-numbered men to fight,  you make damn sure they can call for help!   Sorry to rain on this brave man's parade, but somebody needs to make sure this blunder is not repeated. EVER.    Last of all, let's decide where we need to fight and where we don't.   How about a declaration of war by Congress next time?   Do it right or not at all.

0345528581|5.0|After many years of physical activity and various tries to rekindle high-school sports, I capitulated and bought my very first self-help/improvement book. I admit that the SEAL shtick on the back got me. Sometimes, the explanations of exercises are a bit foggy, but hey - this is doable. The program at the back of the book really offers guidance with several levels of fitness, and I felt, ahem, understood when I started doing the exercises. Now I know a book cannot understand me, but, coming from martial arts in high school, I found the adoption to my capabilities very refreshing. I also liked the educational insight that making a tough program can also be a waste of human capital, but I digress.  I've been doing the exercises for two weeks now, not much I know, and it all takes time, but I am very satisfied by the simplicity, humanity and perspective of this approach. The 30-45 minutes workout per day is doable.    Downside: If you use this book frequently (daily as I do), it'll show. A hardback version would be appreciated.  The training tables would have been better if they had the corresponding pages with the exercises on them. Sometimes the abbreviations do not match, and that makes finding them when you are standing there, sweating and panting, harder than necessary.
B00003CY6M|5.0|Very enjoyable. Sweet predictable film with fun near misses, and you really root for the characters. I only have one gripe, and that is about one of the last lines when Sara asks him \\"\\"When did you get to be so unabashedly romantic?\\"- Are you kidding me? After what he went through, and did to find her, doesn't she freakin' grasp that he clearly ALWAYS has been unabashedly romantic? How dumb...

I will say that it needed to have his band playing. I feel that it was disrespectful to not include them. I consider myself a fan of all types of music and I could appreciate this album. Is it a five star??? No. I do like it, I like the feel. Could it have been improved... yes (let the band do what they do best). Will he come back with better work yes. I will continue to buy his future work. Good, bad or indifferent.
B000Y7U98W|1.0|Do not buy this product. The special feature called Picture in Picture inserts a picture in the frame that offers a special look at the set of the particular scene. The problem is, this feature cannot be turned off. So, for about 12 scenes during the movie (more than half the movie) the audio is not audible because of the picture in picture. It is impossible to watch the movie because nothing can be heard. Until this glitch can be fixed there is no reason to buy this unless you've already seen the movie and don't mind not being able to hear it.

0316077054|2.0|I read \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" a few days ago, and immediately jumped into \\"Beautiful Darkness,\\" since I had both checked out from the library at the same time.<br /><br />I won't bother summing up the plot of this sequel, as of course a summary would give away spoilers for those who haven't read the first book. But I'm afraid my opinion of this novel is very similar to what I thought about the first---it's not terrible, but it's not particularly good either.<br /><br />I found myself more frustrated this second time around, however; I was hoping that some of the problems of the first book would have been rectified in the second, but that was not the case at all. An example: one of the irritations of the first book was that both the magical world that exists just under the surface of our own mundane environment, and the inhabitants of this odd reality, weren't sufficiently described or explained. I wanted to know more---the background of the two families, how these creatures came to be, how the magic system operates, what it's all about, etc., etc.... Now, I'm not expecting a huge infodump, but I thought the authors could have worked all this into the text of the story. Well, they never did---and continued in the same way in this second book. As the story progressed I got the feeling that they were just making up random crap as they went along, with no real logic behind it all. And I just got more and more annoyed as I read, thinking \\"Why am I even bothering with this?\\"<br /><br />Add to this the fact that I was fed-up with the supposed heroine after the first chapter. Oh, I know we are supposed to feel all sympathetic for her, but really; I just wanted to yell at her and say SNAP OUT OF IT! For most of the book I was rooting for the two lovers to split up permanently, no possible chance of reconciliation---not a good sign in a book that is supposed to portray a true romance.<br /><br />So, by the time I got to the end of the book I was thinking that okay, I've had enough of this series. And then wouldn't you know---a chapter or two from the end something interesting happens that makes me curious, and suddenly I was considering reading the next instalment when it is published---could be quite an intriguing story, there. But then in the last chapter there is an INCREDIBLY STUPID AND ILLOGICAL plot development, and once again I'm totally disgusted with it. So, who knows... I may try the next volume at some point, but I daresay by the time it is released I may have forgotten all about this mess.<br /><br />So.... no, not really a recommendation on either book, from me. The writing style itself isn't bad at all, and there are the germs of a great story here. But it's lost in the confusion of a poorly developed and sloppy plot. And once again----these books are waaaaaaayyyyy too long.uldn't you know---a chapter or two from the end something interesting happens that makes me curious, and suddenly I was considering reading the next instalment when it is published---could be quite an intriguing story, there.

1433502410|5.0|I own several translation versions of the Bible, but ESV version has quickly become my favorite...accurate and easily understood. I bought the large print version and the smaller traveling version, both with leather covers. The one column feature of the large print version is easier to read than a single column, and the comments on the bottom of each page are excellent and also easier to use than having to refer to a separate Bible commentary. The bindings of both books is of high quality.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|As a teacher, the movie moved me deeply because it is a very realistic depiction of the life of someone who is autistic and gifted.  Temple Grandin's struggles are shown without making me feel they are being exploited.  Her triumphs are depicted in an equally un-sentimental way which left me cheering for her without feeling that the movie had turned her into a cartoon hero.  Claire Danes is an amazing actress, and the supporting cast is equally well-chosen. I would recommend this movie for anyone interested in autism, facing adversity, tolerance or just excellent storytelling.  I would not recommend it to someone looking for an action-filled film.  This movie is character-driven and thoughtful. Definitely an amazing story and movie.

B004LP3AYI|1.0|This review is not about the novel, but the ebook version.  I can understand some errors during the conversion process, but to misplace an entire section is unforgivable.  A key section dealing with the Sisters of the Dark, originally taking place at the end of chapter 64, has been moved to the end of the book, AFTER \\"The End\\".  Obviously, no one bothered reviewing the ebook prior to publication.<br /><br />Editing errors continue in the next book, \\"Blood of the Fold\\".  Upon checking to see if any sections had been misplaced in that book I discovered sections were divided not by a sword, as in \\"Wizard's First Rule\\", nor by asterisks, as in \\"Stone of Tears\\", but by the words \\"1 Line Space\\".  I did not look beyond the last chapter to see if this occurred throughout the book.<br /><br />I understand Amazon and the publishers' reasons for encoding their products with DRM (digital rights management).  But I consider this a breach of the unwritten agreement between publisher and reader.  If they continue to provide us with inferior, error-ridden products, they should not complain when we strip their protections so we can re-edit their books into something readable.
B0021L9MJG|5.0|I have loved \\"Creepshow\\" since I saw it in the theater so many years ago. I loved horror comics as a kid, and this movie is the perfect homage to the genre; the stories come across as if they came straight out of \\"Tales From The Crypt\\", \\"Ghosts\\", \\"The Witching Hour\\", and so many others of my beloved creepy comics. Written for the screen by one of my favorite authors, Stephen King, and directed by horror master George Romero, \\"Creepshow\\" is, to me, pure horrific genius; this combination of writing and direction elicited wonderful \\"outside the box\\" performances from a very talented group of actors, and is what really makes this movie hold up even today as a terrific horror piece. I've lost track of how many times I've seen this film in its various media - theater, VHS, DVD, and now blu-ray, and it can still coax a jump out of me!     The blu-ray itself is the best transfer I've seen to date, but it's still not perfect. There is some \\"telecine wobble\\" throughout the film, but it seems that may be inherent to the source material; it's been present in every version I've ever seen. Overall, however, I would say that the film looks very good; the colors are well-saturated, and the sharpness and contrast of the picture is generally quite good, especially considering the movie's age. There is some transfer debris, such as specks and scratches, here and there, particularly noticeable during \\"Something To Tide You Over\\", but it's still the best \\"Creepshow\\" has ever looked for home media.     Horror fans, rejoice...\\"Creepshow\\" is finally home on blu-ray...can you watch it with the lights off?
0670022411|4.0|My husband and I bought the audible.com book to accommodate his dyslexia and our RV travels. Because we have a membership it only cost us 1 credit, so I don't have any complaints about the price. We really enjoyed the book up until it ended with no closure of the plot line. As mentioned by others, it's pretty obvious this is to prepare for a sequel. I don't mind sequels. In fact, my husband and I love them for long trips. We just like to know ahead of time that we are committing to multiple purchases and reading sessions. And we like to wait until at least 2 or more of the books are written so we aren't left hanging until another one is produced. I feel the story deserves a good review but because it left us feeling like we fell for a ploy, I can't give it 5 stars.

B004DIPLMC|5.0|As is always the case, the Berlin Philharmonic is stunning in it's gorgeous sound.  Lorin Maazel leads the band in the \\"complete\\" Ring without the singing.  He has arranged most of the major scenes as a continuous wall of magnificence.  Anyone familiar with the Ring will be thoroughly thrilled with this performance.  The orchestra has hired the necessary additional players required by this magnificent music.  I kept imagining how Wagner would have responded to this treatment. Of course, he would probably taken exception to it, as he did with almost everything.  But, I think he would have embraced Mr. Maazel at the end and thanked him, nonetheless.  The DVD is a good introduction to Wagner's music for those who might be reluctant to see or hear the operas.  The various conductors who have waved the stick at this orchestra have transformed the Berlin Philharmonic into a personable and humane organization.  I have ALL of their DVDs (from Amazon) and enjoy them every time I see them, even for the umpteenth time.  Claudio Abbado, and now Sir Simon Rattle, have done wonders to make this group the stirring ensemble it is today.  It is too bad that Lorin Maazel has not done enough with them, at least as far as DVDs are concerned.  The only negative impression I had was that the hall was not packed.  There were many empty seats in the house and I wondered why.  Those who did not attend certainly missed a great performance. I,for one, was re-introduced to this wonderful music, even though I have been a rabid opera lover for decades!

B002MFU9BG|1.0|It's been very disappointing for me the purchase of my first MP3 album. While the Heavy makes great music the review falls on them directly because they must be aware of the terrible sound of most of these tracks. Specially when you listen to them with high quality ear phones, those that are supposed to catch all the great details, well in this case unfortunately it catches the terrible quality of this production. I would almost return it if I could to get my money back. It almost sounds nuts I know. Well, just so you know what I'm talking about download the free version (remix) Amazon has of \\"No Time\\" and compare it with the version of this download. I read one review where someone else experienced the same, I ignored it because I said to myself how can it be? no such thing can be real. But well about me like I said I listen my itouch with good quality earphones, when I listen to it with the inexpensive earphones that come with the itouch you can notice it less.  Disappointed..The Heavy, Amazon, Production house or whatever it is this is a bad product.

0517548232|5.0|These concepts are important for everyone to familiarize themselves with.  I teach economics and it has been incredibly helpful to use these illustrations with my students.  Such simple and easy to read chapters.  Read one a day and really think about each one.  Before you know it the financial reports and the governments budgeting process will come clearly into view.  You will begin thinking in the micro and the macro with ease.  If it makes sense in your home, it will most likely make sense on the national level.      I highly recommend this easy to read little book.  Learn these concepts and see what new world will open up for you in so many areas.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|\\"Brilliant!\\" is the only word that I can use to describe PJ Harvey's latest album. It seems to me that she has found a way to sound \\"friendly\\" without losing her credibility as an artist and her finest touch. Every song here was made so carefully that it's obvious that she knew exactly what she wanted for every track. This is not a loud album we might be used to from Ms. Harvey but for sure it sounds like a new road for her to explore. By moments it remids me to the slowest tunes of Pearl Jam and by others to something The Beatles could've come up with. There's no point for me to mention the appealing of the songs here because this is not a record to play for just a song or two. You must listen to it at all and then going from there to pick your favorites. Personally, I love ALL 12 of them. Honestly.<br /><br />I have always been a fan of the work PJ Harvey has done for almost two decades already but I have found most of her records hard to understand and to get just because they are so self absorb by moments but that is the reason why I love her as much as I love Radiohead after I listened to \\"Ok computer\\" (1997) and the even weirdest \\"KID A\\" (2000). She makes me think, she dares me to sit down and spend an hour or so to get what she's trying to say or to play. She dares me to get into her music world hoping that I find a way out with nothing but admiration and the most real and beautiful feelings. That's the kind of singers I love. This might not be a big seller album but for sure is going to be one of THE MOST respected ones this year by the music community, her friends and even her fans. Long live to Ms. PJ Harvey.

B004NSULHM|5.0|This album isn't In Rainbows, but then again they wouldn't be Radiohead if they did the same the thing over again. It's new, innovative, and a little tricky to listen to but, if you open your mind and just listen to the layers of music they produce, it is beauty in it's most simplistic form. King of limbs takes the listener on a journey through the music and each track is more progressive than the one before. My only complaint is that it didn't last forever!
4770031246|5.0|I love this book! It has given me so many new ideas for quick, healthy lunches to take to work. It inspired me so much that I sought out an online retailer in Japan just to buy some bento box \\"supplies\\" (boxes, dividers, etc).     With that said, I am a busy gal, and I'm not necessarily interested in the ridiculously cute or labor-intensive garnishes normally associated with bento boxes. This book recognizes people like me and keeps the recipes and garnishes reasonably practical.    The options/variations on certain dishes make it so that nearly all of the 25 bento \\"layouts\\" are appealing to me, flavor-wise.     I only hope that Makiko Itoh writes more books in this style! I would buy them all.

B004529NLG|5.0|They should create a \\"Best 3D\\" category at this year's Academy Awards just so this movie could win! As I read some reviews I thought people were exagerating when they said the 3D from this movie rivaled that of Avatar 3D.  I personally didn't think it was possible.  I watched my Avatar 3D Blu Ray one night and then watched this 3D Blu Ray the next night and I have to say that, IMHO, this movie wins hands down for 3D effect.  This movie literally was packed with jaw dropping 3D from start to finish! While Avatar is just plain visually stunning overall, Step Up 3D is without a doubt the BEST 3D Blu Ray I have watched to date.  Clearly movies originally shot in 3D are leaps and bounds above the rest.  When the girl wearing the red and black gloves was dancing it literally looked like she was IN MY LIVING ROOM!  If you are looking for a live action movie to test out your 3D, this is the movie.  Unless you are a teenager, the story line probably won't woo you, but unless you suffer from stereoscopic blindess, the 3D sure will!

B00110K62U|4.0|This DVD is fantastic. The dreamcast is great, and this is the closest you can come to seeing the show, short of seeing the show. I only wish the sound quality was better. The sound seriously needs to be remastered, but still, it's the best thing available for Les Miz fans.
B002VECLVO|1.0|One of the reasons for watching this film, aside from the many positive reviews was to see Colin Firth act. He does not disappoint although his talents are wasted in this poor movie. Firth is a Professor of English coming to terms with the death of his partner of 18 years against the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Most of the action takes place on a single day, when Firth makes a plan to end his suffering. So during this day he has a host of sequences where he meets a lot of characters who add nothing substantial to the film and a dinner date with his long time friend Julianne Moore with a horrible English accent. Tom Ford the director is apparently a famous person but I had never heard of him until I saw the film. This is a horribly written and directed film, I had trouble keeping my eyes open and watched it one hand of the fast forward button. Nothing about this boring and pretentious film made sense. A single star only because I have to rate this film. 2.12.11
B003K1EYM6|2.0|If you plan to use this with an ipad, almost everything you plug in draws too much power.  Devices need their own power source or you need a powered USB hub to power them.  Even thumb drives draw more than the iPad will supply.
B000059XUO|5.0|I think these guys are good at what they do not only was it cheaper than the rest it was also brand new..And the shipping was at a fair price and it arrived in great timeing I am really looking forward to doing bussiness with these guys again Thank You MovieMars I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR
B004NSULHM|5.0|Radiohead is an odd band.  Emerging on the scene during the grunge wave they have been able to consistently reinvent themselves.  I'll spare the reader a history lesson and say that this album is quite impressive. Ok, i'll admit that there are no real hits in here (i.e. creep, fake plastic trees, karma police, etc...), but thats beyond the point.  This album is an experiment. It doesn't all work, but the parts that do (the majority i would say) hit hard, and only like radiohead can. Highly recommended for those who like to get lost in their music.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This movie is fantastic! It makes me happy every time I watch it. I still say it was robbed of the best picture Oscar! Everyone should see this movie.
B003NBFZTE|4.0|I'm 50 years old and training for my third marathon. The recovery time using this item reduces the time I usually need. This is a quality product and I would recommend it to any distance runner. I give it 4-stars and not 5 only because It is the first article of such gear I've purchased. I would buy it again.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I used this product just for 5 times and I like it. Even taking some time to conect to the satelities, the GPS accuracy is ok (a difference in your position of 5 to 10 m for someone that is going to jogging for 5 km isn't a big deal). Some times it gives you some unreal speed peaks but the average is ok.  For someone who is addicted to knowing the distance and speed while jogging, this is a great product. Much better than those foot pods.  I recomend!!!
B000000OEI|5.0|This is a great album.<br /><br />Pretty simple.<br /><br />Oh, you want more? Okay, well if \\"Mutiny\\" doesn't get your blood running, nothing will. The slow, yet purposeful ascension toward the powerful theme is tantalizing as it eggs you on and taunts you from a distance, but the payoff is worth the price of admission. I have yet to get through the opening track without feeling my blood-pressure spike, my adrenalin O.D. and the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. This score is a bit more electronic than Mr. Zimmer's more recent releases, but this will give you a good idea where his talent came from. You won't find a more powerful theme, and this score continues to rank among my favorite a full 16 years after it was composed. Only five tracks, but a full album filled with power and beauty. Hans is among the most talented film composers to ever bring life to a motion picture.<br /><br />~Shadowrun
0061537969|4.0|I decided to read this book because it got such rave reviews here on Amazon. If possible I would have given it 3 1/2 stars instead of 4. I liked the fact that the book was narrated by Enzo, the dog. It had me looking at my own dog with a raised eyebrow wondering if he had simular thoughts. There was some humor and no end of emotion, but I thought the plot was more than a bit predictable. I am not a race car fan and while I appreciated some of the information shared about racing, I found it to be a little too dry in spots causing me to skip over whole paragraphs. There's  wisdom in the book to be had, but it was a little to blatant for me. I guess the bottom line for me is the book was way too obvious with the lessons to be learned and did not require me to think and work them out on my own.
0385341008|2.0|The history aspect of the book is enlightening, the writing about this history is beyond contrived.  Dealing with the latter first, this epistolary writing style is a conceit that leaves me cold.  The last of several books that  I have read consisting of a series of letters, was 84 Charing Cross Road by Helene Hanff, which was a far superior, and shorter, read. It, too, takes place during WWII, but was much more realistic, as the letters take place between a book lover in NYC and a a book seller in London.  It had great strength in its character development, and in many fewer pages. The GLPPPS is ridiculous in the there are \\"letters\\" that clearly would have taken several days to change hands, yet portrayed being read in a matter of hours,  as if they are emails.  Each character is either all good, or completely flawed, with none of the nuances that every human possesses. The layering of love stories, while engaging, leaves no time real time for the feelings of true affection to develop.  The information about Guernsey and its place within the context of WWII is fascinating in informative.  This would have been a much better story if it had been written as a straight historic novel, sans the letter contrivance, though it still would have had to have been  well written.
B003XMXZCW|5.0|Depending on your criteria for what makes a film great, you could argue with my assessment that this is one of the top films of the 1970s.  Martin Sheen turns in one of the finest performances of his career as Capt. Benjamin Willard, a trained special ops assassin who journeys up the Nung River to into Cambodia to terminate Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando).  Kurtz has gone mad and believed to have committed atrocities outside the realm of human decency.  What sets the film apart are the memorable scenes from the film - golden nuggets of  cinematography, screenplay, and sound.  And it is precisely those elements that stand out in one of the finest transfers for Blu-ray to date.  The helicopter scene with Wagner's \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\" blaring down on the locals, the Playboy Bunny sequence, and some of the final scenes inside Kurtz's compound are a few examples of scenes rich in detail, color, and contrast.<br /><br />Not only is the video portion of this Blu-ray one of the best ever, the audio will simply knock you out of your chairs.  I have SA-CDs that don't come close to sounding this good.<br /><br />I've had my heels nipped for mentioning the grain in other films recently released from this era.  And I see comments which basically excuse shoddy transfers from  the late seventies because \\"that's the way they were shot...that's what the director intended.\\"  OK. Fine. Whatever.  I am NOT a younger viewer.  I saw all the films when they were originally released.  This Blu-ray version of Apocalypse Now just demonstrates what can be done when the studio gets committed, and gets the original movie makers involved.  An upgrade worth the investment.  Buy this now.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|A Beautiful Mind is a great movie about how a person can overcome their daily delusions. It is a must for everyone.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This flash works great with my Nikon D40. Exposure is right-on ether normal or bounced. Recharges fast. Small and comes with it's own zippered case. Inexpensive for what you get.
B000OVLBFS|4.0|It's difficult for me to follow this movie, mainly because I have a tough time picturing Tom Selleck as weak, alcoholic, depressed Jesse Stone. But being a great actor, he pulls it off.  The other reviewers have covered this one thoroughly as well as the other Jesse Stone movies.  In this story, Jesse loses his job as a homicide detective with the LAPD, and is divorced by his wife (from whom he never quite recovers), over drinking and unreliability.  Jesse ends up in Paradise, Mass. as the new police chief who isn't suppsoed to do much in the realm of crime-fighting.  But Jesse jumps into the corruption and dirty town secrets, and we have a story. I liked the movie OK, but still not sure about Tom playing this role.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book is so good! The book will keep you guessing till the last page. I enjoyed reading it and trying to guess who A is.
B003JYOFIW|4.0|Well, I guess that I have to get in line with everyone else and say, \\"right on boys!\\"  To me, their last great record was Oh No, It's   Devo.  The next couple of albums were a terrible loss of altitude for such a great band, and I assumed that they they were history until hearing this new one.  It has to be one of the greatest comebacks ever.  The material is surprisingly excellent from start to finish (although I'm not that crazy about \\"Cameo\\"), and they rarely stray too far from that \\"four-on-the-floor\\" dance groove that they pioneered, and do so well.  Their lyrics are crisp, cogent and funny (with the possible exception of No Place Like Home--I have to listen more), and I don't think that Mark's vocals have ever sounded as good, even if he's less quirky than many years ago. Is this as good as the best of their older stuff?  Probably not, but it's a close thing.  Are they quite as wildly original as they once seemed?  No, but who could be? They sound anything but dated, however.  They were so far ahead of their time that now they still sound more original than a lot of groups.  It's just a darn fine record.  In a just universe several of the tracks would be hits, but of course that won't happen on radio when they have so many screaming talk show hosts, pole dancing divas, and \\"classics\\" to helpfully beam into our homes.
B002ZCY7QY|5.0|At the end of season 2 Chuck downloaded the Intersect 2.0 into his head and he gained some serious skills. With those skills he can now be the spy he's always wanted. Though as you could expect the journey to super spy is not without some bumps as he has trouble flashing because his emotions get in the way. Because of this Morgan is finally brought into the loop and is hilarious in almost every scene he is in. Morgan is even more of a geek then Chuck was and seeing Morgan try to help the team is super funny. Also it's nice to see him and Chuck bond again as they can finally discuss everything once again.     Morgan isn't the only one to join the team this season. Special Agent Daniel Shaw joins the team. He is the real spy that Chuck wants to become. He creates a love triangle with Chuck and Sarah that pushes all of the characters forward as each shows their love for one another in different ways. Chuck is more of the sweet guy and Shaw is the suave Bond type. They each battle for Sarah's love and it creates some great story lines. Casey also grows throughout the season as you find out that he has a family. It makes him so much more human as he shows his love to a family that doesn't know he exists.     The main storyline throughout the season is the battle against the Ring and there infiltration of the US government. It has a lot of twists and turns and it really pushes Chuck's spy training along as every week he becomes more of a true spy. It's really exciting to see Chuck evolve into the Spy that he's always wanted to be. Also before the season concludes Scott Bakula returns to try and save Chuck from an overloading Intersect. Also Christopher Lloyd guest stars as Chuck's therapist. He isn't his normal jovial self in the role he plays it much more seriously which is a nice switch up for him.     Overall the season is exciting and thoroughly enjoyable every step of the way. You get a lot of twists and turns while still getting the comedy and charm you expect fromthe series. This season is a step in a new direction for the show. It begins the journey of Chuck actually becoming a spy. It changes up the formula enough to keep the series fresh without varying too much from the nerd/spy/comedy show that we all fell in love with.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Not much to say. Everything about this headset is PERFECT. I wish there was PS3 support for USB headsets so I could use this for that as well.<br />(Oh, keep a couple feet from running microwaves. They tend to break up the signal.)
B0000039QA|5.0|Biggie's final album, released just a few weeks after his tragic death, perfectly encapsulates his incomparable skill and legendary status. Unlike Ready to Die, this record features Biggie's smooth, laid back style on every track, whether he's rapping about murder (\\"Somebody's Gotta Die\\"), bragging about his superstar lifestyle (\\"Going Back to Cali\\"), or collaborating with R. Kelly (\\"F*** You Tonight\\"). There is a host of guest appearances, including verses from the Bone Thugs, Jay-Z and Lil Kim, but Biggie is never overshadowed. Due in part to Sean Combs's dense production, the music here is as much pop as it is hardcore rap. Massive radio hits like \\"Mo Money Mo Problems\\" sit comfortably alongside gangsta tracks like \\"Ten Crack Commandments.\\" What's most impressive about this album is its running time. A double disc set that sprawls over nearly two hours, it never slows down. When the record closes with the chilling \\"You're Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You),\\" it is undeniably evident that hip-hop (and music in general) lost an extraordinary talent in 1997. 5 Stars.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|Although I don't own any of the Genesis LP's with the old audio mix to compare to, I feel that the new mix to the CD/DVD Audio disks was fine.  However, the audio playback for the 2007 interviews on the DVD Audio disks wasn't mic'd that well for listening.  While listening to Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford, I had to turn up and turn down the audio may times to make it enjoyable.  The microphone placement wasn't done well here.  The European concert footage was great even if the video looks old fashion, it still fits in with time of the early 70's era.  Overall, a great box set.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I have a 4 and 2 year old who just love this movie.  The movie has some great parts that are touching.  I recommend this movie for all ages.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Henry VIII has been portrayed throughout history as an overweight, ungraceful man, and a tyrannical king.  A fat, sloppy man throwing chicken bones over his shoulder is the image many have of Henry VIII.  I believe much like The Aviator did to tell the story of the young, handsome & brilliant Howard Hughes, The Tudors reminds us of the other side of Henry VIII.  I agree that creator Michael Hirst took some poetic license, as the appearance of the older Henry, but this only inspires the viewer to learn more.      The series is excellent, and it seems the decision was made to bring out the elements of this story that continues to fascinate.  Over the four seasons of The Tudors, Henry is the center of the story, and is played wonderfully by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.  But just as in history, he is surrounded by equally compelling, and ultimately, more heroic characters.      The Tudors looks beautiful, and is wonderfully entertaining.  Because of some of the historical inaccuracies, I don't believe it gets enough credit for what the series does get right.  There are several moments in The Tudors that stays with you, and many of these moments come directly from the history books, or capture the emotion of the event.  For example:    Henry's scream of pain when Thomas More dies...  Anne looking up at the birds in the sky as the French swordsman distracts her...  Catherine Howard's lonely ballet in Tower as her lovers are tortured and killed...  Jane laying in the church as Henry cries over her body (the music by Trevor Norris is haunting-all 4 cds are wonderful)  When \\"Anne\\" tells Henry near his death \\"Catherine lies beside me...\\"  Anne of Cleves asking \\"If I don't please the King, will he kill me?\\"  Henry looking up at the now famous painting, and whispering \\"Well done..\\"    I would agree..\\"Well done\\"
B003UBTX72|5.0|A first class account of a life lived in full, no punches pulled.  All the up's and down's of an extraordinary life, generously offered for all of us on the outside to get a glimpse at the magic, and pain, behind the music.  Mezmorizing.
B003YQ1QUA|1.0|She sounds like many of the deceased female jazz vocalists.  Billie Holliday,Sarah Vaughn, Nancy Wilson etc.  Her vocal arrangements are not her own but those of Jazz Era 1940's, 1950's, and 1960's.  I prefer Corrine Bailey Rae who was widowed at a young age a few years ago. Give a listen to Mrs. Rae and you will understand.
B002IRYYE6|2.0|Even the man who remastered this version of the Pretenders' first album admits it's a disaster.<br /><br />He won't even allow any discussion of this gold CD on his Web site. I inadvertently started a thread on this disc and it was subsequently removed by one of his brown-shirted minions.<br /><br />In short, just get the regular aluminum CD. Audio Fidelity's gold CD is a rip-off and should be avoided. As my title says: this disc should never have been released by Audio Fidelity and everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves.
0312370849|5.0|What a moving novel. Powerful, and tragic and based on real events during WWII. Tears were streaming down my face when I thought of the torment Sarah endured thinking about her brother and the part she had unwittingly played in his fate. This will haunt me for a long time. Those people that gave this novel 1 star must be from France. I did get more involved in the parts of the novel that told Sarah's story in 1942, but thought that Julia's story and her depiction of those events were well written. The ending was a little pat, but all in all a novel that will stay with me for a long, long time!!
B003Q6D25U|1.0|PA2 is a weak prequel/sequel and delivers very little in every area. The storyline is simple and provides as few details as possible. For instance, what's going on down in the basement? No explanation is provided and you are left clueless.<br /><br />The makers introduce some new and interesting characters but fail to develop and adequately use (I loved the housekeeper angle but she was fired). There are few scares here, but be warned, there is one in the kitchen that will make you jump out of your skin.<br /><br />The big problem here is this is a prequel/sequel and you've seen it all before. It's a quick 'cash-in' sequel that does not tamper with the formula behind the success of PA. For me it wasn't as good the second time around (even the ouija board is back). I found the constant shifting from one camera angle to another a major distraction for me.<br /><br />In closing, I found PA2 to be amateurish and magnified by the film's many shortcomings. If you are on the fench about buying this one rent it first. I think you will thank me later.

B003UESJH4|5.0|THE KING'S SPEECH is simply the best out of a year of so many great movies.  The writing is absolutely enthralling (it takes its time to explore character, but is always  engrossing), and the acting is astounding.  Colin Firth and the rest of the cast (especially Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter) embody their characters with the largest and even the most subtle of nuances.  Also, the editing is crisp, the score is lush and beautiful, and the art direction is flawless.  The movie's cinematography is unique and distinct as well, always finding creative ways to shoot scenes in the same rooms again and again.  Lastly, the messages in the movie are splendid.  Everyone who watches this movie will come away uplifted.  In an age of such poor role models and messages in film, this movie excels in being inspiring and positive, though never preachy.  It is a must-see film for everyone.    NOTE: As many others have noted, the R rating of this film is absolutely preposterous (and actually led to an attempted lawsuit of the MPAA).  Aside from a brief 60-80 seconds of cursing that isn't rude, sexual, or vulgar, the movie has nothing objectionable in it.  Kids would learn a lot from watching it.

B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Refuse to buy it for my Kindle when I can get the hard copy for cheaper. Better yet I called the library and they had a copy for free. Thank God I did that becasue this book after reading 150 pages moved along pretty slowly. I love vampires and the supernatural but this was supposed to be a romance and it is not even close to a romance so far. Maybe it will happen in 400 pages, but I think I am going to return without finishing becasue it is boring and the thought of another 450 pages of the same would kill me. I like books that move along quickly and this does not deliver a quick read.
B00005JLIU|5.0|\\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\" is a wonderful movie musical.  It's an old-fashioned homage to the 'Roaring 20's' and it sends up that period beautifully.  The cast is first rate.  Julie Andrews, one of the biggest Hollywood stars of the 1960's, stars as \\"Millie Dillmount\\".  Fresh from her global triumphs in both \\"Mary Poppins\\" and \\"The Sound of Music\\", Julie makes her third movie musical appearance with this film.  Ably supporting her are Carol Channing, Mary Tyler Moore, James Fox, John Gavin and - what would be her last film - the amazing Beatrice Lillie.  The score is comprised of standards from the era or original songs written specifically for the film and they are all a treat for the ears.  Its' direction, by the ever-talented George Roy Hill, is simply terrific.  The film was both a critical and commercial success.  It would receive 7 Academy Award nominations, ultimately winning one for \\"Best Score\\".  It ended up being one of the top grossing films of 1967 and Universal Pictures' biggest hit up to that time (until \\"Airport\\" took that spot 3 years later).  Despite an Amazon reviewer of the film (one Gary F. Taylor on 12/30/09) claiming it was not financially successful (without showing any proof to backup his claim), the film was a FINANCIAL HIT.  And it remains a movie musical classic today.  They don't make 'em like this anymore.  Our loss.
B003VR5PPY|4.0|\\"999\\" managed to keep me hooked through multiple playthroughs - with different endings each time, you can't help but want to go through it just \\"one-more-time\\" to learn more about the back story and who the culprit is.  If you are an anime/manga fan, then you'll notice plenty of cliches in the story and dialogue, but it is still an extremely interesting story.  Very adult themes makes this definitely not for kids - it deserves the Mature rating.      The only reason I gave this a 4-star rating rather than 5-star was because after the first playthrough, you can fast forward through dialogue you've already seen by pushing right on the D-pad, but you can't skip it entirely so you sit there holding down the button until you get to a new part of the story.  Also, you always replay the puzzles (no skipping), which can be annoying when you've already solved it in previous playthroughs.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I was not familiar with Jane Eyre- didn't get to read that one in High School.  However, I now own the novel and 2 DVDs which already have been played multiple times!  I believe this adaptation is the best thing I have ever seen-anywhere-- in my 46 years!  It is so well-acted, has beautiful cinematography, a believable and likable heroine and the sexiest actor ever in Toby Stephens as Mr. Rochester!  He is mesmerizing in every scene, has a playful humour, a great rapport with Ruth Wilson and has enough sexual heat to keep you warm all winter long! If you like Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy, you will LOVE Toby Stephens' Edward Rochester.  It is sheer perfection!
B000HEWEDK|4.0|Forbidden Planet took me back to my youth. I remember seeing it for the first time at the drive-in with my folks. Even remember my mom fussing to my dad about the swimming scene until she realized the actress was in fact 'not' au natural. Still chuckle at that even after all these years. I really enjoyed seeing this movie again. Been a quite few years and it was fun to compare this early effort against the modern computer generated new age science fiction movies. It shows how far they thought outside the box when they made this one. Just kick back in the easy chair and enjoy it.    The second movie \\"The Invisible Kid\\", well YIKES.. is the best I can say if I want to keep all my commments \\"G\\" rated. Wasn't a total waste of film, but almost. The portrayal of \\"Robbie the Robot\\"  as a remote controlled tin puppet instead of a revolutionary technical marvel nearly ruined the movie for me. The self-aware computer did bring a twist to the plot that at least made the flick watchable. Acting, UGH!. It's one of those movies where you are left thinking \\"THEY COULD HAVE DONE SO MUCH BETTER WITH THIS.\\"    For a change, I found the special features to be actually entertaining. Especially the developmental and deleted scenes. Overall it's well worth the money and is a keeper you'll be glad to have in your library.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|Fantastic movie, very entertaining and full of family values and excellent life advice and very inspiring. When the 100 best athletes of the 20th century were picked, Secretariat was the only non human on the list. This was a very special animal. His story and that of his owners is heart warming and one-of-a-kind.

B00383YC2S|5.0|If you love Alizee's voice, you will love this.   She has grown vocally, and is a true talent.  If you are more of a fan of Mylene and Laurent's style of music, then this album will be very hard to get into.  If you are a fan of French underground electronica,  you will be very happy.    On top of all that...  this is a very well-made album in that it has a lot of dynamic range.   This means it sounds absolutely FANTASTIC on a good stereo.   However, on earbuds or a crappy car stereo, you are going to miss a lot.      In my opinion, her best album.   But also underground and elitest.  It doesn't cater to the masses.   So it didn't sell a lot of copies.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|After reading all of the conflicting reviews here, it was with much trepidation that I ordered this item. My Ipad is brand new, therefore operating system 4.2. No problems whatsoever; the connection kit works fine. I am somewhat baffled as to why it is such a flub with so many other people. AOK here! :>)
B002ZG993Q|1.0|Should be rated at a NEGATIVE 5 stars.     We rented this movie from redbox for $1.06 and even at that it was a big waste of money. All of this movie is one big filler after another. (exp. 5 minutes of him driving through a tunnel followed directly by several minute driving on a long straight open road....) We watched it for 34 minutes including the 3 very long boring adds in the beginning, she fell asleep. I was board to death and looking for something else to do. Normally even if we don't like the movie, if I spend my hard earned money on it I will still watch it all in the vain hope of it getting better. Just call me stubborn. I just couldn't do it for this movie so I turned it off. I can not stress enough that I have NEVER done that before. I have absolutely hated movies but still watched the whole thing anyway but not for this piece of trash. DO NOT BUY/RENT THIS MOVIE!!! Save your money and get something else.    EDIT: I have to add, now that I have taken a quick look at a couple of the reviews written here is that.. I am NOT a big Clooney fan. I did not have ANY expectations for this movie. I didn't pick it. I didn't see ANY adds. I didn't even know what it was about. I like a good thinker or a good action, comedy, drama,... I also watch a number of foreign subtitled films. Some reviewers seem to think that the people that don't like this movie only like action and mindless entertainment. \\"legions of mindless U.S. action fans raised on Jerry Bruckheimer films who don't read, think or wish to be challenged.\\" I for one love a good \\"thinker\\" I have walked out of a theater before loving the movie and hearing other people around me say they didn't understand it. I LOVE to read, my entire finished basement is a library housing thousands of books and yes I have read them ALL. I love to watch a movie or read a book that \\"challenges\\" me. Their blanket statement that anyone that doesn't like/hate this movie must be an illiterate stupid American is just plain wrong andoffensive to me. I do like a good \\"mindless\\" action movie just as much as everyone else but I also like a great \\"thinker\\" that I have to work to watch. But I still reserve the right to call this a piece of trash movie. If someone else love's it that's great more power to them. Just because I don't like/love it and choose to leave a negative review for a movie that doesn't make me or anyone else that doesn't like it an \\"illiterate stupid American with a low IQ\\". Both of our IQ's happen to be high enough to qualify for Mensa. Even if I had the IQ of 60 I still have the right to hate this or any other movie. It doesn't take a high IQ to know a boring movie when I see one. If you love \\"The American\\" write a great review for it but don't criticizes others or call them names for not agreeing with you.

I sat down to watch this with my young kids thinking we would see something on the order of \\"The Santa Clause\\" with that wonderful Tim Allen but was somewhat disappointed.<br />On the plus side, my kids no longer want to go to the circus.
B003Q6D27S|3.0|What can I say that's not already been said. I have read what most of the faithful Saw fans stated about Final Chapter before seeing the movie. I must say that they were dead on. I wanted to see more of Jigsaw, the pink looking blood was beneath the quality of the Saw series, but I did enjoy the final twists. Game over.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I was pretty skeptical about this album, but I read all the good reviews, and decided to give it a listen before buying.  Wow.  That pretty much sums up this album. The songs really are beautiful. I had never really listened to anything like this before, but I would definitely recommend buying this album.
B000W25JUW|5.0|My wife got me the cd as it contains tracks not included on digital copy. Just ripped it to itunes.
B001OQCV6A|2.0|When I first saw this in the theatre I enjoyed it. Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law make a good team and I appreciated the fresh approach to Sherlock Holmes. However, when I bought and played the DVD on my 73 in screen I was disappointed in the video quality. The transfer suffers from obnoxious pixelation and macroblocking, making the movie un-watchable. I have recently noticed this same effect on other movies: Inception and Legend of the Guardians. I have over 1600 DVDs and all play clear and sharp except for these 3 recently released movies. While I'm not usually a conspiracy theorist, I do wonder if this an attempt to push everyone into BluRay?
B0042GIRYE|4.0|I truly enjoy this Cd, however, there are several songs on this album that I can not play while my children are in the car due to \\"choice\\" words.  I wish I had known this when I bought it...
B004DK5CYM|4.0|Another Disney Keeper, well done and since I remember this remarkable horse and rise to fame...the movie mingled the historical with theatrical in a well balance. We viewed as a family and actually watched it two times that day. Nice Background extras as well.
0385341679|2.0|Quick & Dirty: While Ms. Moning has created a fascinating world filled with villainous creatures and intriguing characters, sadly, the final installment isn't well crafted. The forward momentum in the complex and layered plot is lackluster and there is no real resolution.<br /><br />Opening Sentence: Hope strengthens. Fear kills.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />I had such high hopes for the last installment in the Fever series. After the ending in Dreamfever, I just knew that Shadowfever would be explosive, gripping and as satisfying as the previous books in the series. Unfortunately, Shadowfever turned out to be a major disappointment.<br /><br />Many readers will be hard pressed to stick with the story because of the meandering story arcs. It's even harder to care about your once beloved characters, because they started to act - well, out of character. While the pace is a bit slow at times, the story still managed to start out fairly exciting. It quickly jumps the rail and never manages to make it back on the tracks.<br /><br />Mac's endless exposition and introspection didn't help to move the plot along and resolve outstanding story arcs. I think the romantic element was most disappointing for me. I don't think the sex was gratuitous, but Mac and Barrons certainly never get their moment of \\"truth.\\" After everything that has happened between them, I felt that Barrons remained emotionally unavailable to Mac. I also couldn't understand at this point in their relationship why she was so willing to accept \\"non-answers\\" from Barrons. Early on, their speechless moments and games that they played help fuel the fire in their relationship, but it's all for naught since they ultimately never voiced or acknowledged those emotions in a meaningful way. Somehow the \\"romance\\" just ambles along to a \\"happy ending\\" that didn't really feel authentic. The whole thing just gets a bit ridiculous. Readers looking for a fulfilling romantic component won't find it here. The romance felt cold with little or no compassion.<br /><br />V'lane - what can I say? I'm shocked about how his story ends. It's not entirely believable, but I'll play along. Dani - I've never been entirely crazy about her character. I find her annoying and severely in need of an education. Her \\"street\\" and \\"ghetto\\" speak drives me insane. As for her story being front and center for the next series, I can't imagine reading an entire book with her as the protagonist. She just doesn't have the depth, maturity, or character to pull the weight of an entire series. She's also not that interesting. There isn't much action in Shadowfever and many of the twists and turns leading up to major events didn't really amount to much. No one of significance died in the long awaited epic battle with the Sinsar Dubh. Everything sort of fell neatly into place and was very anti-climatic.<br /><br />Overall, Shadowfever isn't Ms. Moning's best work. I loved the first four books, but I can't say the same about this one. For a book that clocked in at 600 pages, it sure felt scattered and not well thought out. Too many loose ends and unexplained events make this one hard to finish.<br /><br />Notable Scene:<br /><br />It hulked near a bookcase, panting. It was enormous, at least nine feet tall. Silhouetted against the moonlight filtering through a window behind it, it had three sets of sharp, curved horns spaced at even intervals along two bony ridges that spanned the sides of its head.<br /><br />I'd seen horns like that before. My pouch of stones had been tied to similar ones. Horns I'd watched melt away when the best wearing them resumed its human form.<br /><br />In the Silvers, Barrons had been slate gray with yellow eyes during the day and black-skinned with crimson eyes at night. This one was in full night mode, velvety black in the darkness but for the glint of feral eyes. I'd heard more of these beasts back in the street, before this one had carried me off. Where had they come from?<br /><br />My hands began to tremble. I pushed gingerly into a sitting position, acutely aware of every stretched tendon and strained muscle. I leaned back against the fireplace, drew my knees up and hugged them. I didn't trust myself to stand. This creature was the same kind of beast Barrons had been and was a connection to the man I'd lost.<br /><br />What was it doing here? Was he still somehow protecting me, even in death? Had he assigned others of his kind to guard me if the worst happened and he was killed?<br /><br />The thing in the shadows suddenly turned and smashed a taloned fist into the bookcase. Tall shelves rocked on floor bolts. With a metallic screeeech, the ornate case ripped from the floor and began to fall. It crashed into the one next to it, and the one next to that, taking them down like dominoes, making a complete wreck of my bookstore.<br /><br />The Fever Series:<br /><br />1.

B002WY65UQ|5.0|I loved the anarchy and the fun they have. My niece suggested it and I was not disappointed. I am going to purchase the second and have the sound tracks to both movies. The actors are great and the plot is very believable.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|The movie was heart wrenching.  I am an animal mom and started crying before the movie started. This movie affected me for days.  It is a must see for people who TRULY love animals.  This is a movie to sit and watch privately because it is so deep and touching.  It is good that Hachiko is remembered with movies, books, a statue, stories, etc.

B000FBJHZS|5.0|Enjoyed the adventure of the story as it traveled the globe. Plenty of action and suspense.  I would definitely recommend to a friend. Dan Brown does a great job of putting a subtle hint of a love story amongst action and adventure.
B0007TKNKG|5.0|This coming of age movie is a real tear jerker that gets to me because I can relate to the main character. Like him, I was estrange from my dad, unlike him, I didn't get a change to renew my relationship with him. I guess this is why I like this movie so much. I can live vicariouly through the characters in it. If you don't like warm and fuzzy movies, you won't like it, but if you are like me and the late Michael Landon, and need a good cry sometimes, you're love this movie.    dmill1953

Not the best style book in the world but then again style is what YOU make it. Lauren gives helpful tips on finding everything from the perfect white tee to wearing a simple black dress 5 different ways.This book is all about the essentials makeup,hair,clothes,accessories. Features tips on what to wear on a first date,to an job interview,even a casual night out. You may not be able to create a whole new wardrobe but you'll surely pick up a few helpful tips.       I took off a star due to the fact that most of her tips were designer related,not everyone can afford YSL, Balenciaga,and Hermes other than that good read.
0823015017|5.0|I purchased this book knowing very little about working with polymer clay and mixing to generate unique colors. This book far exceeded what I was anticipating. The book is broken into small sections and projects which build off of each other. The photography and directions are very clear and concise. The book really explains how to build color palettes that are unique to each person so that your finished project does not look like colors that everyone is using, or colors right out of the package. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking to get a good grasp on color mixing in clay.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|I like sci fi films, and based on Amazon.com reviews, I decided to watch it through Amazon's on demand service.  The actors delivered, the story was seamless, the 'alien' monster was visually cool and it kept me entertained for a couple of hours.

0740797719|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1NX052CMUMFCE]]  KEEP THIS BOOK WITH YOU AT ALL TIMES AND DO NOT LEND IT TO ANYONE !<br /><br />When I ordered this book I only had a vague idea on how color should be used and I thought I was just getting one more piece to the puzzle that is color theory. Little did I know that this book would fill all the gaps I had about the subject, it helped me understand chroma, cool/warm colors, color harmony, color schemes, complementary colors, how ambient lighting affects our perception of color and so much more.<br />Thanks to James Gurney I can now fully understand the color choices artists make when creating their artwork.<br />After having read a few chapters in the book I couldn't wait to start painting and so I created this image with my new found  knowledge. Whether you are a traditional painter, a digital artist or even a photographer this book will definitely improve your work.

B003EYVXTQ|5.0|At times this two million dollar Best Picture Oscar nominee is a joyless albeit compelling journey, but for those who know the [[ASIN:0316066419 story]] that Daniel Woodrell adapted his amazing screenplay on, there is far too much vigor in these characters for it be written off as gloomy and not worth the casual film-goer's time.  The mortifying journey's destination is a lively reward indeed.<br /><br />Winter's Bone is without question one of the year's best movies in what amounts to be a very potent field of candidates.  It has been nominated for four Oscars altogether, one additional being the aforementioned adapted screenplay and the others being for performances by its lead Jennifer Lawrence and another for her co-star John Hawkes.  Both are worthy, but given the similar subtle cold determination in their characters I can't help but think it is much more than just things that tie these characters together, but the powerful style this film was intentionally created to possess.  There are very strong controllers behind the scenes here.  Those strengths and many more are directorial ones, and Debra Granik ([[ASIN:B000I0QL7I Down to the Bone]]) might deserve the most credit of all.  She's been snubbed of an Oscar in my opinion.  The film's cinematography by Michael McDonaugh (who's also credited as a producer) as well as its editing also deserve tremendous praise.<br /><br />Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 17 year old girl growing up in The Ozarks.  To say she's experienced a difficult life is an understatement.  Her father is arrested and jumps bond.  Her mother is likely a catatonic schizophrenic while Ree plays the role of surrogate mother to her two younger siblings.  Her father is soon about to cost them their home and he must be found to prevent an already horrible life from getting far worse.<br /><br />The obvious thing about this movie is the future stardom of Jennifer Lawrence.  She's going to be a big deal but in a good way.  The 20 year old is talented in ways that no actress of her generation has yet to display.  Her quiet and layered performance as Ree may not win her the Oscar but she sure does deserve it.  She's so deeply engaged in her character that in scenes where her face maintains a gaze of melancholy bravery, she manages to show us glimpses of what her character is feeling beneath it all.  I think of the fleeting look of joy while seeing a small country band at a birthday party play their fiddles and how badly I wanted to see her smile.  Her character's emotions are contained but apparent, as even her tears are inhibited before they finally see air.  She made Ree among the greatest heroes to appear in film in the last few years.  I hope Hollywood doesn't kidnap Lawrence and make her play superheroes but I fear it's too late.<br /><br />Perhaps the less obvious thing about Winter's Bone is that Debra Granik will go on to create more great movies, but I do suspect with confidence that will happen.  This film is certainly not to be missed.  Everything about it comes together beautifully to tell a very compelling story.  I can't recommend it enough.ress of her generation has yet to display.

1439107955|4.0|It was heavy going for this lay person but soooo interesting. A little frightening, too. Now I understand better how complex a challenge cancer is to understand and conquer. Before reading this book, I thought all the money poured into cancer research for the better part of a century seemed to go into a black hole, considering the modest progress that's been made. Now I see how politics, human shortcomings AND the staggering complexity of the riddle that cancer is, make progress such a slow-go.    The author writes very well and makes the subject as intelligible as possible. Nevertheless, I had to take a break, sometimes, from the concentration necessary to follow the scientific details! The testaments to the courage of the human spirit described in specific, landmark cases were inspiring.     Personally, the greatest benefit for me from reading this book is that I have a greater repect for the people working to solve the riddle and more realistic expectations for a cure if I should get this disease.
B002NZK5QY|3.0|I tried over and over to watch this movie, but there is no initial screen with the words 'play movie' or anywhere to pick out how to start the movie...    After a LOT of fiddling around with my computer and the dvd drive, I finally was able to get the movie to start, and not watch a 'silent movie'.  I am pretty sure those went out many, many years ago.      It is the same movie I always loved...just has no intro to begin watching.  Very annoying!

B003OF3R0S|5.0|The bar for great hard rock records has been lifted to the heavens. The vocals on Avenged Sevenfold's  album Nightmare strike hard with precision on the heavy songs and are bittersweet on the slower songs. The eerie and rhythmic guitars join with the lyrics to set the mood. The whole album is practically driven by some of the best drumming in the world. The album produced three hits that are currently being played on the radio. Nightmare is a modern day, heavy metal masterpiece.     The vocals are obviously the most notable part of any album, so for this to be a masterpiece the vocals would have to at least be pretty good, right? Well, it just so happens that they are. The lyrics of most of the songs are about losing someone who's very close, they are extremely accurate and really portray what the experience is like. M. Shadow's vocal talent and  range are simply amazing. Shadow's also uses different effects with his voice throughout the album. For example, he uses a hissing effect on the song \\"Welcome to the Family\\" which is very fitting at that point in the song, because he is talking about losing his mind. The vocals on this album are outstanding, but they wouldn't be the same without the outstanding guitar work.              The lead and bass guitarists are an electrifying duo with their heavily syncopated sound. The guitar work on this album can also be described as absolutely haunting. On the heavier ssongs such as the title track \\"Nightmare\\" the syncopation keeps things alive and unpredictable- which adds to the shock value. In the ballad \\"Victim\\" which is about how the band members were feeling after their band mate died, the guitars have a moody sound effect to them. In the song \\"Save Me\\" which is about a man feeling trapped inside a world that he wants to escape and he is crying out for help for guidance, the guitars have an almost orchestral sound to them. During all of the songs Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengance seem to feed off of each other andco-operate very well. The guitars wouldn't be the same without the excellent driving beat from double bass drum set behind them.              On December 28th 2008 the world lost one of its best drummers, along with the members of Avenged Sevenfold lost a man that was like a brother to them. To honor his memory, the rest of the band brought in the Rev's idol, Mike Portnoy in the help them finish recording.  The drumming itself in this album is energetic, hard hitting, and unorthodox thanks to the both drummers skewed style of playing. Mike Portnoy was strictly following the Rev's already written music, but he added several small things, such as some extra symbol work. The Rev will most certainly be missed and this album wouldn't be the success it is without him.         It is a real shame that the Rev never got to see the masterpiece this album became because I think he would have loved to see the finished product. Every single song on the album was written and produced in honor of the Rev. The band even put his favorite song \\"Nightmare\\" on the album.  \\"Nightmare\\" is about being committed to a decrepit insane asylum and realizing you will never leave. \\"Welcome to the Family\\" was the band's second hit off the album, and was released to help promote the videogame  \\"Call of Duty: Black Ops\\" because the song is about fighting a losing battle which goes along with the entire game's setting of  the Vietnam War in the aforementioned game. Their newest hit from \\"Nightmare\\" is the one song that their former drummer (the Rev) wrote 100% of titled \\"Fiction\\". He turned in the song to their record label on Christmas Day of 2009, which was three days before the Rev died. \\"Fiction\\" is surprisingly about saying goodbye to everyone before he dies, which almost foreshadows the Revs own death.  \\"Buried Alive\\" is their second hit off of the album, and  is easily one of the best songs on the album, it slowly builds up to from a melodic rock song to a strong heavy metal finish.Overall \\"Nightmare\\" is a like a steel, smooth, unrelenting roller coaster ride from beginning to end. Despite all of the obstacles they had to overcome, every single member of the outdid themselves. M. Shadows did a fantastic job with the vocals, improving both his vocal range, and lyric writing from past albums. The guitarist pushed the envelope with their heavy shredding in the heavier songs on the album, and moody almost orchestral sound on some of the other songs. Finally both of the drummers did a fantastic job of literally driving every song with their amazing talent. \\"Nightmare\\" is simply the best heavy metal album to come out in the last ten years, and it will be remembered for years to come.
B0000069NM|4.0|This recording has some great playing and some great grooves.  If you want something with great groove and great soloing as well, you will enjoy it!
B001NFNFIK|4.0|I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this film- I can often take or leave Tommy Lee Jones, as he so often plays the gruff-yet-philosophical-Southerner type and could almost be accused of the Robin WIlliams syndrome- too many of the same sort of roles (tho Robin has busted right out of that prison with a handful of well-done psycho roles). But I remembered why I essentially enjoy him as an actor, because nobody can do the gruff-yet-philosophical number as well as he.     First off, as a Southerner, I was very happy to see some intelligence accorded to the natives. Yeah, there are your usual white trash folk here, but that is a reality- prodigious use of the \\"n\\" word, lots of beer drinking and fishing, etc- and to pretend that doesn't exist would be false. But I very much enjoyed both Jones' lyrical way of talking as well as Levon Helm's Civil War general- and I won't say much beyond that lest i give it away. Naturally this is based on a novel so I can only say that the screen adaption has made me mightily curious to read the book, as it has a lot of depth and a surprising amount of heart.     The one flaw the film had was the perplexing use of people who couldn't act in supporting roles. Some of the local types seemed like they were reading off cue cards, and Buddy Guy, bless him, has plenty enough talent without having to prove that he can act, which i am sad to say, he can't. There was also a little bit of an overdose on the folksy wisdom a time or two, but I found most of the film surprising. I was definitely surprised and it exceeded my expectations. I would call this a supernatural mystery, and I wish more of them were set in the bayous- a haunted place if there ever was one.
B004NSULHM|5.0|Yes it is atmospheric.  This in no way resembles OK Computer or the Bends or any of their proper \\"rock\\" albums - but then Radiohead told us not to expect he same approach after Hail To The Thief.  And what is the result of this new phase?  I'd say it's better music to paint to than blasting in your car with the windows down (yet I do suggest blasting it loud or with so you can hear all of the subtle shifts and changes - it will kill you with a whisper)  Most of these songs are centered around loops like Everything in It's Right Place, and from those initial loops other loops are borne, layers are added, drum loops become live drums, chanting begins and the record indeed ends up sounding both innovative as well as ancient as the King of Limbs' namesake - with different limbs of musical ideas twisting out into different directions.  Clearly a bold thrust in a direction that they had only been tinkered with before (except if you don't count Yorke's the Eraser.)    This album feels like the follow up to the Eraser more than In Rainbows.  The tracks on this album also has the feel of Radiohead's more interesting B-sides, which usually was the arena where they put their more experimental efforts and let themselves hand loose.  In the case of this album, all the tracks feel like honest innovations, like the band is seeking new territory, and so in a way it feels like an album of b-sides which in my book is an excellent thing.    This review was originally written only after a few listens, however, after living with this album for a week here are my *personal* thoughts on the individual tracks;)    Bloom - a sonic welcome mat, with some surprises - the Yes-like synths over-arching like the Northern Lights are a nice effect.  These are definitely sounds we've never heard from them.  Thom's voice swells in an attempt to swallow the cosmos, like the song says, \\"Open you mouth wide\\" he could be asking us to think larger, to take in more...    Morning Mr. Magpie - Here we're catching a hint of the muted guitar swagger that began on Amnesiac with I Might Be Wrong and went on to be more apparent in Hail To the Thief.  Like strutting through a haunted house.  Sexy.  Twisted groove.    Little By Little - As with the rest of the album, this song plays with your expectations of what the beat should be.  The guitars stand out but are never overstated, feels very Kid A to me, especially with the sounds that lace the last minute of the track, very Everything in its Right Place.  This song goes on a tad long for me, but it's so interesting the relationship between the guitar, vocals and beat that it is hypnotic as heck.    Feral - this is SO Amnesiac it kills me, raw and expansive.  It feels like digital drums but THESE ARE LIVE DRUMS that go back into digital again!  Amazing.  Colin's bass work which is especially fascinating on this album weaves in an out of focus.  Thom Yorke meanwhile paints us a sonic tapestry with his vocals, sounding like a creature that has been infected by technology but (like well...a feral) is returning to a primal state, a forest where words are not necessary.    Lotus Flower - is the re-invention of the pop song.  Tom Yorke released a video for this on his website where he's dancing around like Prince, enjoying the dancability of his music...YES HE INVENTED A LOTUS FLOWER DANCE.  Its an amazing video with just him dancing on an empty stage, black and white, that could be construed as part piss take but is certainly celebration of Radiohead's new sound and direction.  He has so much hip swinging swagger!  The song is so bad ash, he hangs on notes like a junky, addicted.  And when he goes to the chorus your heart wants to burst from your chest.  Very Idiotech.  I also love the sincere.  This song is surely about addiction (hence the Odyssey reference) but the lyrics here as well as the other songs are so sincere and poetic.  I'm in awe.    Codex - The most devastatingly beautiful track.  I can't even find words.  The first listen was a holy moment.  Even the nay-sayers will have to give that one to the band.  Like the dragonflies Thom Yorke mentions here, the horns section swoons over the top of the songs promising the divine.  As for the theme of the album, (and I realize I may be overreaching) this song proves that the technology-addicted human can still return to raw beauty of our natural world, enjoy it and hopefully even save it.  I also love how the album's beginning wanders into a blippy bloopy forest of darker more mysterious songs but after Codex the final two songs lead us to closure, and reconcilement with the artist's more experimental methods.    Give Up the Ghost - \\"Don't haunt me...Don't hurt me\\"  chant the boys as if they were five year olds facing down their Boogymen.  The song could be seen as a person-to-person plea from one lover to another, but like many songs on this album the romance of this song feels connected to a greater love for the endangered enviroment.....  Like the best of Radiohead's work it is hard to nail down, which is wonderful.  As for the sound, this is a perfect accoustic Radiohead track akin to the B-side 4 Minute Warning as if they band is all sitting around a circle beating on their acoustic guitars....The song's bridge here is soaring and stupidly beautiful.  (The sonic noises at the end sound like insects in the night.)    Separator - What an uplift!  The way the other tracks grow in a thoughtful way, this song lifts like an R&B track off the ground, swagger intact.  It manages to showcase Phil's drumming, Thom's lyrical genius....by the time the guitars come in with their up-beat lilts, you will be in heaven and that's when Thom promises, \\"If you think this is over then you're wrong\\".  The final layer is Johnny's spooky reverb guitar that comes out of the 1980s and wipes the plate clean.     ---I gave this album 5 stars because, even now having heard it 100 or more times, the album keeps revealing itself to me and is such a potent personification of the new direction the band talks about.    To the naysayers I only suggest listening to it again.  Though not using such drastic changes as Paranoid Android, the album will surprise you with its different levels and subtle shifts.  They have built a solid world here and it is full of secrets and and sincere beauty for the patient ear.  These guys know what they are doing and they are delivering on levels that I have only begun to uncover here.  Thank you Radiohead.

072325804X|5.0|I bought this book for my small grandniece, as a birthday gift.  She instantly recognized it as a treasure.  She doesn't treat it like her other books.  She sits quietly and carefully turns the pages, as if she knows she will want to have it for a long time.  She keeps it separate from the others, and has become a complete Potter (NOT Harry) fan.  This was an inspired purchase.  I hoped that my childhood passion would translate to this generation, and it SO does.
0312600844|2.0|Claims of greatness have been mightily exaggerated.  \\"An instant classic,\\" I heard.  \\"The great American novel,\\" was another claim.  Sadly, these claims are not true.  Having loved, loved, loved Franzen's first book, The Corrections, I attacked this new offering with gusto.  The trouble started right away, when I didn't like any of the characters.  The prose was boring, the storyline failed to go anywhere, and I didn't believe Walter and his bird sanctuary.  I felt bogged down, and had to force myself to finish, an obligation to my book club.  An outwardly perfect family is really messed up.  I get that, and I certainly could have gotten it in a lot less than the 562 pages the author took to get us there.  I'll admit, the ending was slightly better than the rest, but overall, this is not a book I recommend.
0312360258|4.0|I got to read this book because a friend gave it to me, she told me its with Vampires and stuff, and I got a bit dissapointed because I'm sick and tired of Vampires, Twilight is a good book/movie but its not THE book, sorry to say this.    Now when I started reading Marked, I got fascinated by the worlds of Zoey and her character, and what I liked more was the style that its written, its so lite and easy to read, plus the story is fast and full of action, thats what I love with those books, their stories are fast and full of action, while Twilight Saga books are only how Edward looks amazing in the sun and stuff like that, I don't trash Twilight, but its not a book for all readers, its a book for girls, ONLY girls, while House of Night allows more readers than girls.    Marked is not Harry Potter but its definetely one of the best books I have ever read, and it makes you want more...    If you are a young girl, who wants to read about Bella's feelings for Edward then buy Twilight Saga    If you want a book with action and a plot Marked is for you...
B0045DO8NI|4.0|From her R&B debut \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" to her true breakthrough album \\"M!ssundaztood\\" all the way to her recent \\"Funhouse\\", P!nk has always had a strong collection of both albums and singles. Eleven years later, we are treated to the majority of these hits on one CD. The CD is one of those that even though it has 18 songs, each of them are true hits and can be listened to without wanting to skip one. The packaging of the deluxe version is sort of like a book, and when you open it, the first thing you see is each of the song's single covers, which is really cool. The bonus DVD is a nice touch, and it's great to see how P!nk reinvented herself with each era, and the behind the scenes features are nice, especially the photo-shoot one.    The new songs are both gems. \\"Raise Your Glass\\" is a typical Max Martin pop jam, but is great nontheless. \\"F---in' Perfect\\" is a another great self-acceptance song, although I actually prefer the radio version called \\"Perfect\\". All in all, it's a great collection that I would recommend to any pop music fan.

B000J6I0PM|5.0|This is a superb DVD of two Foo Fighters concerts. You get the amazing Hyde Park 'rock' concert, as well as the more sedate, but just as good Hollywood 'acoustic' concert. The foos play with equal passion and interact with the audience for both types of gig and it's great to see both sides of their music. You get a great selection of tracks, including the ever popular and anthemic 'My Hero' and 'Everlong'. Overall a great music DVD for fans, showing one of the best and most respected bands in music today. Well worth a look.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B004DWKO8Y|4.0|I just want to say it's a very good cd, and meets the expectations I had. It's an album that has hard rock, instrumental virtuosity, good songs(All The Way Up is the only song that I don´t like) and that returns us to the MR. BIG more rockers. The only bad ...  Why there is a lot of great bands who like the productions of Kevin Shirley?. I think he breaks the clean sound that had MR. BIG in the album BUMP AHEAD for example.In short, a good album with a producer with more prestige than it deserves in my humble opinion.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|This is a good Christmas film and is worth watching for a few good laughs. Will Ferrell is his usual funny self and comes out with some great lines that will crack you up at his delivery. This is exactly what it sets out to be, a light hearted Christmas movie and it more than delivers in that respect. It is a little cheesy in places, but there are worse Christmas movies out there for that and overall this will provide a couple hours of light, fun afternoon viewing. What more can you ask for? Not excellent (hence the 4 stars), but good fun never-the-less.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B00020X88O|5.0|All the fakeness of the characters went along with the type of situations they were portraying. The silly sex, the over-exhuberant stripping. Berkley and others were playing the role of dancers playing a role. They had to act in a one-dimensional manner, to get what (they thought) they wanted - how are they supposed to play the roles of sex-starved fame-seekers in a nice and caring way? This movie is a great commentary on life; about how we are encouraged to do things that go against our conscience in order to get ahead. Isn't it interesting how the main characters fought each other for the main part in the show, and yet from the audience perspective it is quite difficult to distinguish one performer from another? Many of us know a Cindi who we loathe, and yet may actually dislike the things about her that we see in ourselves? How many of us claim that we are not the whores or pimps we see on tv, but then realize perhaps there is not such a difference between us and 'them' after all?
B00000G3I2|2.0|Although trying to have a very adult, sophisticated air, this movie is really about as sophmoric as The Breakfast Club, just with somewhat older babies. For a somewhat better take on the lost aspirations of one's youth, That Championship Season did a bit better job of it, if in an equally obvious manner.    But at least The Big Chill IS about adults, made for an adult generation, something that just a few years later would rarely be seen out of Hollywood.  And, what a cast!

1587155419|2.0|The King in Yellow is a typical anthology horror, in that some of the stories work, and some don't. Its generally worth picking up for the better half of its tales, and also one for Lovecraft enthusiasts, as the Yellow Sign has come to be incorporated into the Cthulhu mythos by later writers, and is now featured in the various Cthulhu board and card games, etc.     However, this edition leaves something to be desired. Its cheaply printed, and full of typos and formatting errors. I'd recommend finding a better edition before purchasing.
0553381709|4.0|The 3rd book was a good continuation of the saga by George R.R. Martin.  He continues the story line through out the characters, and adds a twist now and then.
B004NSULHM|3.0|While I did enjoy listening to this album, I have to say, considering it's been over three years since their previous album, I was a bit disappointed to find that there isn't more material. 37 Minutes seems a bit low. This is the shortest album to date.  Every one of their previous albums is over 40 mins (some even over 50 mins). There is a sense that time and effort went into the music and the production, but there isn't any flair. The album doesn't seem to go anywhere...Certainly worth the buy, but don't expect this to be OK Computer.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Not only is the movie excellent (obviously, look at the number of accolades it has received), but this 2 disc set also comes with a full length documentary on the making of the movie, which was really awesome to watch. Totally worth having for the price, it's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and still get something new out of it. I highly recommend!
B002ONC9NM|3.0|I recently watched the film An Education (2009) on the Starz Channel in HD. I wish I could say I connected with it, because its a very well made film, but unfortunately the story just didn't appeal to me. It's basically a coming-of-age story about a 16-year old British girl in the 1960s. It just wasn't an interesting enough story for me. I give the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, because it has beautiful cinematography, good acting, great production design, and solid music. For those that connect with the story, you'll probably rate this film higher. I heard about An Education through the end-of-year awards pipeline back in 2009. It was nominated for 3 Oscars, including Best Picture. Actor Carey Mulligan leads the strong supporting cast and her role in this film led to her roles in Never Let Me Go (2010) and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010), where she shines even more so than here in my opinion. A similar but better recent coming-of-age story from a similar time period is Nowhere Boy (2010), starring Aaron Johnson as the young John Lennon before The Beatles. I highly suggest you \\"guys\\" watch that one instead of An Education. For you \\"ladies\\", An Education may just be your cup of tea.
B0049JPU8A|5.0|I was thrown off my some Record Label's review about the CD being mediocre but whoever they are don't know real music when they hear it. Although the first CD was awesome, this CD is by far my favorite! Buy it! You won't be disappointed! <3

B00110K62U|5.0|This DVD captures the intense drama and historic sweep of the narrative of Les Miz. Starting with the commanding performance of Colm Wilkinson, the cast serves up a consistently compelling portrayal. Production  values and sound are impressive. Great orchestra and chorus.    To study this musical property and to understand its impact in the history of the musical, this is certainly the best alternative to actually seeing the show live in the theater.    Obviously, I highly recommend the purchase of this property.    David Christiani - Montreal

B00006JL1Z|5.0|My husband enjoys music, all kinds and was a big fan of Fleetwood Mac.  After hearing a song of theirs on an Oldies Station, he looked on Amazon to see if he could find any of their albums in CD form.  He did and decided this would be the best one, full of all his favorite songs.  He put it on his wish list.  When I purchased it the delivery was quick and he loves it.

0307346617|5.0|they are, in my mind, the most boring \\"monsters\\" imaginable, but I love post apocaliptic fiction and wanted to read something, so, based on the reviews, I tried this and loved it.    Most zombie fiction I've read seems to be all fighting. Boring. This book is about the reactions people had to the fighting and it was very well done.  I agree with the complaint that the voices in the various chapters were not distinguisable, but this is zombie fiction after all and you have to make allowances.    This also answered a question I have about all \\"monster takes over the world\\" book--what happens next.  Most of those books, the hero stands triumphant and the book ends.  I always think, well, then what? This book is all then what.  Very interesting.    The problems I had with the book were, 1. where did the zombies come from?  Yes, China, but what caused the whole thing?   2. I read this on my Kindle and the footnotes were not linked.  This is a kindle 2, so that might be the issue, but the footnotes always worked before, so it may be something in the formatting.    I'd say try this even if you think zombies are boring
0061537969|5.0|Having Enzo narrate the story is brilliant; his perspective is unique.  TAORITR took me gently into the world of auto racing as Enzo told us about his  master's life from his point of view.  The analogy to life is wonderfully refreshing and gave me a new way to look at things.  I highly recommend this gently narrative.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|I installed the memory in my HP CP1525nw.  The side door on the printer made it very easy to install. I then enabled the memory in Windows 7 following the instructions in the HP CP1525nw manual.  I then printed a configuration page to verify that the new memory was working.  It was.  I am not sure how often the additional memory speeds up the printing of complex documents but for the price how could I lose.

B003L77G6A|5.0|UPDATE 5/20/2011:  The season developed well.  I continue to like Amy.  As for Bernadette, I wasn't crazy about her when she was first introduced but now I think she definitely adds to the show.  Someone recently wrote that it's about time for Priya to go.  Unlike Bernadette, I really liked Priya when she first showed up, however, I also now think it's time for her to return to India for awhile . . . let Penny have a little more air time.  It was a great season 4 finale last night.  Oh, one more thing, the smoking monkey a few episodes ago was fantastic!  He and Amy work well together.    ORIGINAL REVIEW (still valid): This is my favorite show on television; it makes me laugh out loud.  Each character is unique and yet they blend together well when paired up with some or all the of others.  I see that some reviewers here don't like the introduction of Amy.  I must admit that when she first showed up I didn't know if this was going to be a good move.  However, as this season has progressed, I have become a fan of Amy.  Her relationship with Sheldon is funny, but Amy's growing relationship with Penny has become very, very funny.    It seems whenever the show takes a turn, I find myself questioning where they're going with it, but it always turns out to be a hoot.  I absolutely L-O-V-E this show.

B004NSULHM|5.0|Radiohead announced the release of their new album \\"The King Of Limbs\\" earlier in the week, and it was offered for download without fanfare a day earlier than scheduled. This album is very electronic and experimental with very little guitar, similar to \\"Amnesiac\\" or even Thom Yorke's solo effort \\"The Eraser\\".<br /><br />At 8 tracks clocking in at about 37 minutes, the album opens with the atmospheric pseudo-Jazz \\"Bloom\\" with Thom Yorke's vocals soaring over skittery beats. \\"Morning Mr Magpie\\" is an ambient piece with some chiming guitars and a jabbing groove. While \\"Little By Little\\" has some Middle Eastern sounds thrown into the mix. \\"Feral\\" is a dubstep instrumental laced with fleeting vocal bursts.<br /><br />\\"Lotus Flower\\" is the lead-off single, with Yorke's falsetto over a haunting beat-laden soundscape. \\"Codex\\" is a string-swathed piano ballad with Yorke cooing  \\"Jump off the end/into a clear lake, no one around\\" - typically oblique lyrics with sufficient humanity for the discerning. The acoustic ballad \\"Give Up The Ghost\\" is set to gently strummed guitar with ghostly harmonies swirling around, while closing cut \\"Separator\\" raises the tempo with groovy beats.<br /><br />Just as it was released unexpectedly, this is a grower that grabs you when you least expect it.
B0038QGXHW|5.0|This is an incredible CD....such beautiful, haunting ballads.  Keith Jarrett is perhaps one of the finest pianists of our generation.  This CD does not disappoint.  I could listen to it every evening at least a couple of times.  Highly recommended by a jazz lover.
0802473156|5.0|I just finished reading this book and it was such an eye opener.  My marriage is on the verge of divorce and I read the book with hopes that I may salvage it.  I realized some of the things I was doing were not my wife's love language although I did do a lot of things that are in her love language I suppose maybe not enough.  When someone attempts to walk out of a marriage for someone else or meets with people of the opposite sex in secret (platonic or not) means there is a possibility that they are not getting what they need in their current relationship. This was kind of shocking to me seeing my nick name is marshmallow to my friends and that I do so much for my wife and I adore her. That said 30 years with one person is hard to walk away from. Reading this book made me say to myself \\"hold on\\" maybe I am not doing everything right. I also realized I feel so un-loved and un-trusting because my love tank is virtually zero meaning my wife hasn't met my love language in several years but because I adore her so I would have lived like this forever. I pray it is not too late for us and that this book can really help. Now the realllly hard part, convincing her to read it at this point she hates me(the last chapter is all about a one sided love and how to possibly change to get the other side back)  If you relationship is in trouble please read this book and if you can have your partner read it, if you follow Gary's advice you really could have a wonderful life long marriage.
B004NSULHM|4.0|Readers of a certain age may recall the career trajectory of Roxy Music, who went from creating a wildly eclectic, unclassifiable mix of styles  in the early 70s with their first two albums to delivering the benchmark for smooth, anodyne, adult-friendly pop with \\"Avalon\\", their eighth studio album, in the space of 10 years. With their eight album, Radiohead seem to be doing a Roxy in reverse, producing what is arguably their most experimental and varied album to date.  In some ways it makes \\"Kid A\\" sound positively radio-friendly, yet at only 38 minutes or so in length, all these songs have a tangible urgency to them.  (Coincidently, the reformed Roxy Music have recently completed a successful UK tour, acknowledging that they bring with them two sets of fans, those who like the early albums and who would have, like me, lapped up most of the set, and those who know only the later Avalon-era/chart-friendly stuff.  I suspect the same goes for many Radiohead fans).  \\"Bloom\\" gets things off to a suitably experimental start, a looped piano quickly mutating into a two-note repeat over a drum `n' bass-style backing and meandering bass that recalls Roni Size/Reprazent's \\"New Forms\\"  album.  Thom Yorke wanders in, sounding both enigmatic and unusually optimistic: \\"Open your mouth wide/the universal sigh/and why the ocean blooms/is what keeps me alive\\".  The song continues in this groove, an echo-laden   trumpet sounding like something borrowed from The Specials' \\"Ghost Town\\", a hint of Indian strings before the song ends abruptly and we tumble into the urgent, skitterish \\"Morning Mr Magpie\\".  This has a very Beatles-ish title, something heightened  by the Lennon-esque melody of the chorus, but mutates toward the end into an extraordinary deep bass reverb from which the instruments are quickly stripped away, leaving a weird machine hum and birdsong.  \\"Little by Little\\" starts with a vaguely Spaghetti Western-ish flourish of acoustic guitar set to a grounding rhythm which sounds like a number of slightly out-of-synch bedside clocks ticking away, with a chorus of \\"little by little/by hook or by crook/I'm such a tease/and you're such a flirt\\".  \\"Feral\\", the shortest track on the album at just over 3 minutes, effectively acts as a bridge to the remainder of the album which is more song-based.  An extended riff based on skittish drumming, repeated vocal loops and found words, before unexpectedly deepening into a swift bass hum and Kid A-microbeat coda that brings the tune to an abrupt end ahead of the similar beats that underpin \\"Lotus Flower\\".  This has been premiered already on YouTube, showcasing Thom's solo dirty dancing spot and might be thought of as classic later-period Radiohead.   As is next song \\"Codex\\" , which sounds initially like a companion to \\"Pyramid Song\\" from \\"Amnesiac\\",  but is transformed with the arrival of the vocal, and then again by a subtle key change and some lovely, echoing massed brass.  The album tangibly warms up at this point.  Although there have been nods to 70s Kraturock along the way so far, \\"Give up the Ghost\\" is the most obvious, sounding like something that would have sat comfortably toward the end of Faust's infamous \\"Faust Tapes\\" album, a collections of outtakes and severe experimentation.  Closing track \\"Separator\\"  gently blossoms from radio static and speed-up birdsong with some gently guitar work that recalls The Cocteau Twins, with Yorke intoning \\"if you think this is over/then you're wrong\\".   Another example of the optimism displayed in \\"Bloom\\" or an aside to fans and critics alike that Radiohead mean to pursue this increasingly non-comformist  vein of theirs?  More than enough moments for those who enjoyed \\"Kid A\\" or \\"In Rainbows\\", but perhaps not one to convert the Gallaghers.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|When Spartacus, ( Blood and Sand) first started playing on the tube, I only got to see a few episodes of it. It was enough to get me interested for sure! Then between my work and the series being aired so late, I was unable to watch ALL episodes. I went to Amazon and purchased the whole series of episodes and watched them almost from start to finish! The Daytime soaps doesnt have anything on Spartacus, Blood and Sand. The action and drama will keep you in much suspense and make you want to sit it out through all 13 episodes. I must admit that I did grow bored with spartacus' morning and pining for  his \\"wonderful\\" wife, but it wasnt enough boredom to stop me from watching. Maybe if they had allowed more scenes with him and her in it and let the viewer become more interested in their relationship, Spartacus' whining and pining would have been more worthwhile. Who knows. For those of you that like alot of action and drama and throw in alot of sex, these series is a must to watch and/or purchase!! I commend all the actors and actresses for a job well done. Sorry for Andy Whitfield's illness, is sad for such a young and budding actor. Can't wait to purchase Spartacus, Gods of the Arena!!
0553582038|5.0|I was warned, as no doubt most A Song of Ice and Fire fans were as well, that A Feast For Crows was an unworthy follow up to the darling of the series thus far, A Storm of Swords. Stories of the publication issues, the extreme length of the original manuscript, and the expansion of the series as a whole, with Martin choosing not to skip over the five or so years that was originally planned after the events of A Storm of Swords, were rife. Even the very people that recommended the series to me in the first place were quick to warn me not to get too amped up for Feast, as it was an inevitable disappointment.    Three years and as many re-reads later, and I still have no idea what they're talking about. While it remains true that Danaerys and Tyrion are missing from the book entirely and Jon Snow is only seen in short glimpses, their absence is more of a subjective loss than an objective one. The core strengths of the series are still in ample supply; Martin's flair for detail and character are as strong as ever, and the mysteries that are hinted at throughout the book are as engrossing as any other.    As the title implies, A Feast For Crows is a story that is, at its heart, about the aftermath of great events; in a word, loss. Murders of very real crows pick through the slain of the War of Five Kings, and the center of so many of the plots and counter plots of the previous books are either slain, indisposed, or crippled (the crippling being emotional or metaphorical as well as physical), leaving a power vacuum that the clever but short-sighted schemer Cersei Lannister is eager to fill.    Make no mistake, A Feast For Crows is largely Cersei's book. Fans who find her irritating to the point of distraction will not enjoy her chapters, as they are generally filled with Cersei celebrating her intelligence after committing some folly. Subjective opinions of Cersei aside, her chapters are subtly handled; it's easy to cast her aside as a madwoman or an idiot, but Martin implies throughout it all that the core of Cersei's motivation is fear. She fears for her only son and daughter, she fears for her own safety and the safety of her house, and her throne. The pillars of her world have been pulled from under her: the rock that was Tywin Lannister lies rotting on a bier, and her brother/lover Jaime has changed, in her mind, for the worse. In her inability to cope with events, she mistakes folly for genius, and her actions ultimately seed her own doom.     There is a bit of a fourth-quarter effect in some of her chapters, however. The prophecy of the valonqar seems to fit, but there was no mention of it in previous volumes. While this can plausibly be simply because Cersei never had a POV before, it still seems like it was tacked on. Without it, she still has reason to fear Tyrion, and even that simple motivation when seen through the lens of a scared mother who doesn't allow herself to grieve is enough to qualify her actions. The volunqar storyline, however, neatly parallels her character arc in Feast; it is strongly implied that in her fear, she partly fulfilled Maggy the Frog's prophecy by killing the only other person who was present when it was foretold. In that way, even if the volunqar story was thought up the weekend before publication, it still has a significant and worthy impact on the plot.    The other reason people seem to mislike Feast is Brienne of Tarth. In terms of the number of chapters and page time given, Brienne comes in a close second only to Cersei. So, again, the subjective dislike of Cersei and Brienne have a very significant impact on the opinions of Feast at-large. However, Brienne's story, despite being full of what Jaime calls \\"bleating,\\" contains the larger portion of action in the entire book. Jaime is forced to fight his battles with wits and words instead of steel, and aside from the Ironmen, the rest of the realm is winding down from the war and fighting grows less frequent. Mileage may vary, but for my money Brienne's quest was a fascinating look at the deplorable state of the seven kingdoms, and there is a brutal grimness to her chapters that suggests that Westeros will get worse before it gets better.    Jaime is at his best in Feast, hands down. His chapters are more interesting, if less action-focused, than his chapters in A Storm of Swords. It is in Feast where Jaime truly begins to change. Tyrion's mocking words at the end of Storm haunt him to the extent of rebuffing his sister, and as her attitude abruptly changes toward him, his own changes toward her as well. His struggle is largely personal, as he has to contend with the demons of his past while at the same time relying on them to keep him alive; the very reputation that he loathes is, right now, the only thing staying the blades of so many people who would see him dead, and House Lannister cast down.     Feast also features Littlefinger at his best, divulging more of his plans than in any other book, and Sansa's growth from a dreaming woman-child to an intelligent, capable young adult is astonishingly well handled. Samwell Tarly advances the master-plot of the Prince that was Promised and gives a quick look at the developing understanding of events to come, and the focus on the Ironmen, as well as a much-needed look at Dorne rounds out A Feast for Crows as one of the more comprehensive entries in the series, despite the exclusion of Jon, Tyrion and Dany.     There are some complaints that Feast is a sideshow, that is doesn't advance the main storyline in any meaningful way, but I find that a little hard to grasp. Though there could be more focus on the chapters outside of King's Landing (I don't think three Ironmen POVs are necessary; having just Victarion or Just Aeron or just Asha would have sufficed - same goes for Dorne: are Arys' AND Areo's AND Arianne's chapters necessary?), their impact on the events to come are HUGELY important. Doran Martell's plotting against House Lannister is revealed, suggesting that Dorne will be a huge player in books to come. The Ironmen are making ever more aggressive strides toward conquering the Seven Kingdoms at large, and they also are interested in Danaerys. I'm still at a loss as to what people expected from Feast; no, it doesn't end in an epic confrontation like at the end of Clash or Storm, but the subtle advances of the master plot and the focus on the fallout of the War of Five Kings is just as important in the grand scheme.    I would like to make it clear to any potential readers; the only loss in A Feast for Crows is the loss of Jon, Dany, Tyrion and Bran. It is unfortunate, but I don't feel as if it ruins the series or even bogs it down. The pace of this book is on akin to A Game of Thrones, but where in the debut volume events were ramping up, in this volume they are winding down. Coming in at over 900 pages, even with the exclusion of the Dornish and Ironmen chapters, including four of the ball-carrying POV characters would have expanded Feast beyond a doorstopper; it would have been a veritable tome. Further complaints are, I feel, more directed at fans' annoyance at the absence of A Dance With Dragons. Feast is no weaker than any other novel in the series. It is as GRRM states it is in the afterword; the full story with half the characters.    Feast is a worthy entry in the series, and well worth re and re-reading, as are all the rest. The subtlety of the writing and characterization, the hints and snapshots we get of the larger events, the development of the characters and the overall tone of loss in this book are not the flashy, quippy, action-packed events of A Clash of Kings. Nor are they the epicly brutal events of A Storm of Swords. This is a book about the victors licking their wounds, the losers facing their fate, and those who have been left untouched preparing for worse.    5/5
B0030IIZ56|5.0|It's hard to follow the original, but this sequel is quite enjoyable with it's own charm. Blu-ray does amazing things to animation.
1453624910|4.0|Glimpses is a more than apt title as that is exactly what the author delivers, no more and no less.  These are glimpses of scenes that could have been, but weren't.  This book is decidedly for diehard fans of the series, and is appropriately illustrated by fans themselves.  I enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />The first story, Misfit, takes readers back to when Seregil first came to Skala, the origin of Phoria's hate of him, and how he became Nysander's apprentice.  The tale made me want a prequel of some of Seregil and Micum's early adventures as Watchers.  I do miss Nysander!  The second story, The Wild, is my favorite - the tale of how Alec's father, Amasa, met Ireya.  It is vividly told, and bittersweet.  If only Alec could know it as well.<br /><br />The third story, By the River, is a very brief tale of how Seregil and Micum first met.  Though it has little substance, I did appreciate that it showed Seregil once had the same prejudices against Tirfaie as most of his people.  The last story, The Bond, may be the most anticipated.  It is the tale of Alec and Seregil's first night together.  Some readers were disappointed in it because it didn't have a lot of depth.  I was more forgiving because Flewelling is neither a romance author, nor a short story author.  I thought the story was quite good given these constraints.<br /><br />There are some homoerotic scenes in the stories, but they are tame compared to actual gay romance (i.e. not explicit).  I would have given the book five stars, but for one thing.  It is very short and somewhat expensive as a result. I read this in about an hour. I wish it had included a couple more stories, but overall I was very satisfied.  Highly recommended to fans.
B000002AH7|3.0|Being somewhat new to jazz, or at least traditional jazz, I had heard the name Miles Davis and had heard he was one of the greats. I decided to check it out by buying two of his most well-known albums. These were Kind of Blue and Sketches of Spain. The second of these two I consider to be the more avant-garde. The pros of this album is that it is different, and the cons of this album is that it is different. I'm not a trained musician, and don't claim to be an expert, but it is definitely not elevated elavator music. That is to say, it is not dull, repetitive smooth jazz. I've been trying to think of how to describe it, and perhaps, by comparison, it is like going to a Greek restaurant for the first time: different, yes, and possibly something you could eventually develop a taste for. I listened to this album for the first time today, after listening to Kind of Blue last weekend, and it is captivating. It is not something you put on and read a book to while half-listening. It is worth checking out.

But for those who have got the basics down and want to extend beyond the little tiles and add even more techniques (and, of course, new Tangles), this is the book you've been waiting for.<br /><br />It's thin, and I'll admit I was a bit stunned at how thin, but then I opened it up, and there's so much going on on each page!  Techniques (the best discussion of shading I've seen), tangles, exercises, tips, you name it!<br /><br />It also discusses other uses of the tangle--such as basic printmaking, transfers, using them in journal pages, and of all the cool things, painting rocks!<br /><br />Did I mention there are more than 60 new tangles?  There's an index at the back for them, too, which is such a handy feature.<br /><br />If you have her first book, you probably don't need to read this review to put this on your must-have list, but if you don't and you've been tangling for a while, you need this! And if you're just beginning, or need some inspiration at how amazing and dazzling they can be, you need this book!  It will keep your mind and pen flying!
B001DF68MA|2.0|I bought this bike seat because it appeared to be a value priced alternative to the Dutch style child seats made by Gazelle and other manufacturers. The user reviews were all strong but several problems emerged.  1) The seat does not fit small to medium framed bikes at all. My wife has a Schwinn Cream (same as a Breeze or Collegiate) with a 21inch frame and mounting the Weeride interferes with the ability to pedal or steer safely. It appears the only kind of bike this actually fits is a very large framed mountain bike that has a sloped top tube.  2) The mounting point for the seat onto the bracket is secured by one small aluminum bolt, and when mounted, the seat is wobbly and insecure.  3) The plastic for the seat is flimsy and too flexible  4) The belts are not sized or mounted in such a way that the child can be secured safely and comforably. I suspect the designers practiced with dolls and did not factor in the ability for the child to move or even breathe  5) Sharp \\"flash\\" on the molding areas that can cut skin.  6) No protection or support for the child's head. Children fall asleep when riding, and there is nothing to support the child's head if sleeping, nor any way of extending the seat.  7) No protection in the event of a fall for shoulders or head, as with other child bike seats. If this bike falls the child could be badly hurt even if wearing a helmet. If not wearing a helmet, the consequences could be grave.  Defintely not recommended.
B00192IV9U|3.0|Any time an artist dies and an album of postmortem music is released without fully being completed by the artist themselves I am skeptical. Not skeptical that the music is genuine, there's plenty of conspiracy theorists on here for the exciting tales of forgery and how Elvis is still living as well. No, skeptical because someone else is finishing the production on the songs that the artist started. This much is fact. I highly doubt Michael Jackson had completed any of these ten songs and put the finishing touches on them.<br /><br />That being said, this is mediocre Michael. Mediocre like Michael's first four solo albums for Motown in the early-to-mid 1970's. Some promising songs, but ultimately forgettable, much like Michael's last album, 2001's \\"Invincible\\". Name one memorable track from \\"Invincible\\" because there aren't any. \\"Michael\\" at least has one saving grace--\\"Hold My Hand\\". Akon does a brilliant job of putting the finishing touches on this song, and it sounds like Akon more than Michael, but they sound, unexpectedly, harmonious. This is the only track on \\"Michael\\" that indicates anything remotely salvageable about Michael's after-life career. Extremely melodic and memorable, \\"Hold My Hand\\" should be a top 10 hit. Strangely, my wife doesn't like it (go figure).<br /><br />The second best song here is \\"Behind The Mask\\". This track sounds like the old Michael Jackson of yore (as well it should since it is from the \\"Thriller\\" era).<br /><br />There are some tracks that are decent, but not great such as \\"Hollywood Tonight\\", \\"Keep Your Head Up\\", \\"Monster\\", \\"Breaking News\\" and \\"(I Can't Make It) Another Day\\". I really was unimpressed with Lenny Kravitz's production on \\"Another Day\\". I own all of his albums, and this song is not his finest moment.<br /><br />What I am about to say next will burn me at the stake with Jackson fans. I really get sick to my stomach when Michael goes soft. \\"(I Like) The Way You Love Me\\", \\"Best Of Joy\\" and \\"Much Too Soon\\" are the most sappy saccharine sludge Michael has released since \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\", \\"Heal The World\\" and \\"Childhood\\".<br /><br />Against my better judgment I am sure I will continue to buy music from the now exhumed and well preserved ghost of Michael Jackson. Much like his contemporary, Prince (and for that matter, Madonna--all born the same year, 1958, within three months of each other--coincidence? Or conspiracy?) All three, whether dead or alive (it's hard to tell these days) are legendary for not knowing when to stop or reel in their excesses, but even a small table scrap from these three icons is worth more than a career worth of Justin Bieber schlock.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Michael\\" compares to previous Jackson solo releases:<br /><br />1972 Got To Be There: Two and a Half Stars<br />1973 Ben: Two Stars<br />1973 Music & Me: Two Stars<br />1975 Forever, Michael: Two Stars<br />1979 Off The Wall: Three and a Half Stars<br />1982 Thriller: Four Stars<br />1987 Bad: Five Stars<br />1991 Dangerous: Three and a Half Stars<br />1995 HIStory: Five Stars<br />2001 Invincible: Three Stars<br />2010 Michael: Three Starsas released since \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\", \\"Heal The World\\" and \\"Childhood\\".

0385341679|3.0|PEOPLE WHO HAVE YET TO READ THIS SERIES - attention! Now that it is COMPLETE you should really read it. Personally, I think that's really how it should be read for the 1st time, all the way through without stopping as opposed to over-analyzing while having to wait for the next installment. That screwed me from enjoying this as fully as I know it should've. I'll explain.    I need some quiet time to do a re-read though so I know my initial impressions are just that..initial. I feel like my reading was in fits & starts b'c I had such a heavy week & was literally falling asleep while reading I was so tired.    I had 3 main issues with this story though. One, I am on a book forum & we analyzed everything to death in this series. We touched upon most things in one way shape or form so it was fairly anti-climactic for me. I never had a Holy S@#!t moment. It was a level, smooth ride with some \\"Huh's\\" here & there but no \\"HOLY S@#%T\\"!    Add to that, Moning's own blog where she said she had trouble even given teasers b'c they reveal so much b'c there were so many Level 4 & 5 HS moments. For me? Not so much which was majorly disappointing. So the hype by the author herself didn't help my expectation level.    And since I kept waiting for my mind to be blown & it had me on such tender hooks the whole time & as a result, I don't think I allowed myself to just sit back & appreciate the overall creation b'c I was waiting be so surprised. I screwed myself. No one else to blame for that one.    HOWEVER, there are caveats to that statement. As I said, I can completely own the fact that I messed it up for myself in many ways by digging into it so hardcore & then having my expectations be extremely high. So I do know why I wasn't able to sit & fully enjoy it like it should be on 1st read. Like I said, learned that lesson!    I also know that I ENVY the lucky bugger who gets turned on to this series now that's it's COMPLETE b'c without any stops? Holy hell, it must be one heck of a 1st time ride but this doesn't mean it was without it's flaws if I'm being completely honest.    My 2nd issue was that it's long winded. Mac was far too introspective throughout the novel & her ramblings went on & on.  And Moning dragged out the red-herring's like crazy b'c of this. I had to wait (and those who read know what I'm talking about) 80% the way through for something to actually really happen. It was tedious for me & I was disappointed with how it played out. When we meet Mac in the beginning of the story she is bereft & accepts what's in her heart & yet...she goes back to same old, same old until the 80% mark. That was very frustrating & didn't make much sense to me character wise although, I do understand why Moning dragged it out plot wise but that doesn't mean I liked it & thought it could have been dealt with earlier & executed better.    Thirdly, some of the characters were out of character & had Cheesy McCheeserson moments. They did not ring true & it bothered me.    Overall though, I think this is a stellar series, one of the best out there. Moning is an immense talent & I couldn't respect her more for painstakingly putting this together. There were ZERO continuity errors. Most things were very much accounted for. I still have questions but for the most part, she got it all in.    I couldn't have more respect for her as an author who has put her heart & soul into her work, for herself and for her fans. You can tell she does it for her readers big time. No selling out. No complaining. No resentment. Never phoning it in or losing the plot. Nothing trite whatsoever & 1000% effort to surprise her readers without surprising them meaning, no wild explanations coming from left field that don't fit, in order to be clever. She wouldn't dream of it. It's clear the process is a joy & she is grateful so doesn't let anyone take that away from her & IMO, of course the quality of her work is tops as a result. All of this comes through loud & clear. She is a classact all the way.    I still have some questions of course but that's to be expected. A friend of mine said something about Moning's style which was so true. I am quoting her verbatim here b'c I think she nailed this, I hope she doesn't mind (Oh & don't believe her little comment about her limited intellect b'c she is wicked sharp as a knife).    \\"What I LOVE about KMM is that it really is there from the beginning. She does do a good job of keeping it hidden just enough, but not so good that I (with my limitations of intellect) could not figure some of it out...But like a good lie, you can't nail it down for what it is until you know for sure.\\"    That's spot on with this series. I have already gone back & re-read some bits in the previous book & am smiling & shaking my head going, \\"now it all makes perfect sense\\". To me that's just genius. LOVE that.    However, I have to rate the book on it's own individual merit, as it stood for me when I finished the last page.   I definitely liked it but I didn't love it nor was I blown away. Yet, the series as a whole I would give 5 stars to b'c it is an overall experience.     Overall, KMM put every ounce of herself into this series, bless her little cotton socks. You couldn't ask for anything more from an author. Thank you KMM.    And I know when I do my re-reads & go through all 5 in a row, it's probably going to make me squee in amazement like a little fangirl over how freakin' tight she made this series.

The book begins kind of slow, feel a little like reading someone's journal and the date format is a little different, but after 25 or so pages I found myself totally drawn into the story and unable to put it down. There are several shocking parts where the writer touched on some very adult and difficult topics that made it hard to continue, but Mr. Larsson's wonderful writing style made it irresistible to continue to the end.
044656740X|1.0|People love the concept of being able to acquire massive amounts of wealth without hard work.  When someone comes along with a book saying they have the secret to becoming really wealthy.  People like the concept of being different from the crowd, by rejecting college (which he says is for suckers) and rejecting being employed by someone else because they can invest on their own.  And I bet some people who are reading this were told by a \\"financial guru\\" that they will make easy money by selling Nutrilite drinks via Amway, as well.    Here's my challenge for supporters of this book:  Name one person who have become rich off of this book (other than the author).  The author is very rich, though he made his wealth off of this book rather than any business ventures before.  Millions of people have purchased it and it has been out for over 10 years so if what Kiyosaki is saying is true, somebody must have became wealthy off of it, no?

1582701709|1.0|The basic premises of the book can be summed up in several sentences instead of 100+ pages:  1. Think positively (thoughts become things)  2. There is a \\"law of attraction\\" between like and like  3. Visualize and you will receive  4. Everyone can be abundant    The rest of the book is filled with quotes, platitudes, and anecdotes.    Of course this book runs into numerous complications:    Wishful Thinking  Just because X ought to be true does not me X is true.    Cherrypicking  This book often uses anecdotes, but anecdotes do not represent the human population as a whole.  There may be two examples of people who have survived cancer through positive thinking (suggesting that positive thinking cures cancer), but that does not represent all cancer patients.    Economic Fallacies  Everyone can't be abundant.  Everyone cannot own a mansion.  With a large population, many people will be poor or lower class, unfortunately.  Theres a finite amount of resources so for all to be abundant is impossible.    Dogma  By eliminating all negative thoughts, any possible criticism of this book is eliminated as well.  You can't criticize this book at all, because if you do, you are thinking negatively.    Conspiracy  Bryne tries to convince the reader that numerous historical figures such as Einstein and Socrates knew \\"the secret\\".  And that the secret was well hidden from us for centuries and she is the person who is revealing it to us.  It's no \\"secret\\"; shes introducing nothing new.    Developed World Bias  In a developed world, we have opportunity of success (education, human services, etc), but in poor developing countries, no such opportunity exists.  Unfortunately, we cannot expect a family born in the poorest part of Sudan to succeed if they visualize.    Fault  Is it the fault of hurricane victims and the starving for not thinking positively enough?  Can such tragedies be avoided simply by thinking positively?  No and no.    Realisticness  Risk needs to be calculated whenever performing an important action.  Calculating risk cannot be just pushed aside because it is negative thinking.  Focusing on both the pros and cons helps to make an important decision, but when focusing on one, that is not being realistic.  Optimism is one thing, but blind optimism is another.    Constancy  Bryne asserts that \\"the secret\\" always works.  She never wrote a disclaimer saying that sometimes when you think positively, you may not get exactly what you want.  She said it ALWAYS works 100% of the time, which is not correct.    Lack of the Scientific Method  She uses no substantial evidence (other than cherrypicking anecdotes) of any kind to support her grandiose claims.  We should just take her word for it     Self improvement and positive psychology is very important.  There are numerous scientists, doctors, health experts, and psychologists that wrote numerous books which actually make use the scientific method and provide evidence to support their claims.  Unfortunately, this self-help movement has resulted in some people who know little and have achieved little to profit by producing works of little meaningful substance.  Byrne's The Secret, a prime example.

I would recommend this book to people of all fitness levels - there's something there for everyone.
1449382673|5.0|Head First Python is an excellent intro to the language.  The book's teaching method keeps the pages turning, and by the end you will have built apps on three platforms (PC, Android, Web).  You will also have good familiarity with Python's bundled editor and command interface.<br /><br />I was pleased with the inclusion of Android interface coverage and Google App Engine (GAE). I had not yet deployed a project on GAE and that experience added value to the book. The example projects were good enough for instructional purposes, though after a couple of chapters on the same project I found myself losing interest... luckily the author changes the sample project a few times.  The exercises had a varied style to them, which helped maintain interest.  Some of the exercises are straight coding to solve a problem, but others present some code and have you piece code blocks together from a pool of provided code lines.<br /><br />Many language tutorial books are hard to read from cover to cover and maintain interest and attention... I didn't have that problem with Head First Python and was able to read the whole book easily. Anyone needing an intro to Python should consider this book.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I'll admit I had my doubts about this book.  It's written from a DOG'S point of view!  My first thought was \\"really?\\"  But, mark my words you WILL LOVE THIS BOOK.  I wasn't very far into it when I discovered that the dog is just as, if not more, likeable than the characters at times.  As the book goes on I became almost entranced with the characters, especially Enzo, rooting for them, laughing at them, crying over them.  This book tugged at my heartstrings and it made me almost sob (and I am NOT an easy crier, mind you).<br /><br />It makes me wonder if my Labrador is walking around out there somewhere...Read this book, it's worth it.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|This mini-series tells a war story - with the concentration on experiences of the people who did the fighting.  (Tom Hanks, who was a part of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and worked on \\"Band of Brothers\\" also worked on this mini-series.)<br /><br />We follow the Marines as they \\"are ordered to fight on dots of land that many people have never heard of before.\\"  Each battle has it's own horrors; weather is clearly a factor along with diseases, and snippets of scenes at home are also present.<br /><br />It might be enjoyed more if you have a background on the people and places.<br />We barely meet the guys before they are dumped into the fighting (no training seen, as in \\"Band of Brothers\\");  the fighting in the Pacific tends to be \\"put into the background\\" compared to the European Theatre of Operations, especially Hitler's Nazi regime.  We rarely see anyone give a hint as to why they are fighting in a particular place (is that because no one who actually did the fighting knew??).<br />The results were quite evident, however: staggering fatalities on both sides and the mental struggles that these soldiers were stuck facing.  What truly amazes me is that many of the guys who could have gone home and stayed put chose to come back and fight next to their buddies ... even after all they had already endured.  Only by depending on one another did anyone stand even a chance of survival.<br /><br />(I personally have little knowledge of what went on in the Pacific, besides the fact that Japan started WWII for the USA, Wake Island, Midway, and Bataan Death March, and the fighting ended in 1945.)

Five lines from the title song, and the title, are directly from Much Ado About Nothing, including \\"Serve God, love me and mend\\" \\"Live unbruised, we are friends\\" \\"One foot in sea and one on shore\\" and \\"But man is a giddy thing\\".  And also in \\"Roll Away Your Stone\\" the line from Macbeth is \\"Stars hide your fires; let not light see my black and deep desires.\\" And that's just what I noticed on a quick first listen, which makes me wonder what else is there, and from whom. Not that I don't like this CD; I do, very much. And I fully understand the use of literary allusion, even quoting. I'm just saying it, because I read all of these reviews, and no one else is - although someone thought maybe Shakespeare was an influence. Ya think?
0316286850|5.0|This book is extremely well done. The examples of different looks you can achieve, how to use different products, the specific types of each product (ie. pencil eyeliner vs. cream eyeliner) are very helpful. The section in the begining on shading and contouring was great. I spent a good amount of time in front of the mirror with this book experimenting.   Athough now some of the looks are a little outdated, many are still classic and the celebrities shot are still around today.

B004A8ZX28|4.0|A fairly common theme in fictionland centers around amnesia. A character is injured (head injury) and wakes up with a fuzzy memory and little awareness of self.     Well, this film develops that theme. It begins with a renowned American botanist, Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson), flying into Berlin with his adoring, stunningly beautiful wife Elizabeth (January Jones). After leaving the airport, the couple is just outside a luxury hotel when Harris realizes that he is missing a briefcase, which must be very important.  He finds himself momentarily separated from his wife, seconds count, and the briefcase is most likely at the airport. So, Harris jumps into a taxi (conveniently) driven by a beautiful, resourceful, tough, compassionate, illegal immigrant, Gina (Diane Kruger).  Almost immediately, things go very awry.    The plot is somewhat confusing. I don't want to reveal anything, but most likely you will develop \\"selective amnesia\\" regarding the plot anyway. That is, you will forget it not long after the credits roll. What will \\"stick\\" are great shots of a wintry Berlin, a spectacular car chase, the sinister deeds of sinister folks, and another powerful performance by Liam Neeson. It seems to me that Neeson has the role of tough-guy-against-the-world nailed.
1604443499|4.0|\\"Homage to Catalonia\\" is a candid retelling of the author's months in Barcelona and the Arag&oacute;n front during the political uprisings of 1936-1937. Orwell focuses on intimate details of his life as a member of the POUM (Partido Obrero de Unificaci&oacute;n Marxista) militia -- his decision to join based more on his desire to fight fascism than to further any political cause. This somewhat arbitrary decision would come back to haunt him later. The relatively short chronicle focuses on two things: life in the militia and an attempt to add clarity to some of the misleading propaganda of the time by comparing it to his eye-witness accounts of the turbulence.<br /><br />The military affair was gritty and chaotic, and Orwell repeatedly observes that Spanish inefficiencies in the ability to conduct military campaigns was something of a godsend. Poorly equipped, wallowing in filth and lacking even modest provisions, Orwell's unit forged ahead with its vague orders. He dedicates significant space to his reverance for his unit and comrades and makes a point of it to relate details of combat and life at the front to the character of the Spanish people. He also humbly points to his own misadventures as a soldier which readers will likely interpret as quite courageous and inspiring.<br /><br />The political side of the book reads much like the retelling of life at the front. Orwell doesn't use the homage to make a political point; he is more concerned with comparing what he saw to what was reported, often in great detail, while confessing that it still can't possibly clarify the confusion of the politics of that time and place as much as debunk some of the obviously false accounts of the crisis written from desks far removed from the area. In other words, if you're looking for an op-ed this isn't anything of the sort. It's more a foundation for his later \\"greater\\" works of fiction. One thing is clear, however, and that is that Orwell has contempt for attitudes of authoritarianism and reverance for egalitarianism. He ultimately leaves Spain more out of necessity than desire. Clearly he wished he could have done more to fight off the eventual tide of fascism that eventually prevailed.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who's interested in Orwell's biography or the anarchist uprising in eastern Spain. It's candid and not jaded in the least. And the author is clearly struggling to tell a true story of an experience rather than express an opinion of these incredible events.<br /><br />One curious thing to note about this Indo-European Publishing edition: the book makes a point to credit Alfred Aghajanian as the proofreader, but it is the most poorly proof-read book I've ever read (starting with the first word of the book: \\"CHPATER\\"). Readers will have to struggle through proofreading errors on almost every page and do their own interpretation of this amateurish edition. It might be worth looking to another publishing source for the same story, which is a highly worthwhile read.litarianism. He ultimately leaves Spain more out of necessity than desire.

0670022411|5.0|Deborah Harkness' debut novel, A Discovery of Witches: A Novel, is amazing.  I was drawn in from the first and did not want to put it down.  It's like a mature Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1) meets The Da Vinci Code.  The characters are interesting and complex, the story is exciting without being too ambitious or overcomplicated.  The book held me spellbound and is responsible for a few hours of lost sleep. It's an historical-supernatural-romance-adventure-mystery--my favorite genres wrapped into an exceptionally good book.    Diana Bishop is not going to use her magic--at least, that's what she keeps telling herself.  She is the last in a long line of powerful witches, with a father as powerful as her mother.  However, having lost her parents when she was seven years old has turned her away from her heritage and her magic.  While researching alchemical manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, she comes in contact with a volume that reaches out to her magic.  Panicked, she returns the book to the stacks, but it is too late--word is out that she has discovered the lost Ashmole 782 and now all species of creatures are after her.    Enter Matthew Clairmont, renowned scientist and vampire.  He has been searching for Ashmole 782 for centuries and is determined to retrieve the book Diana has recalled.  He feels drawn to Diana, feeling the need to protect her from the other creatures, despite witches and vampires being notorious separatists.  They are thrown into an uneasy friendship when the worlds of witches, vampires and daemons descend upon Diana, all looking for the manuscript.      A Discovery of Witches: A Novel is one of the best books I've read in quite a while.  It's clearly written to have a sequel, possibly more than one, and I am anxiously awaiting the next book.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading.      Follow my reviews at readerbarbara at blogspot dot com
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|The Pacific is another outstanding film produced by Dreamworks with Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg.  The film has a very compelling story of several individual marine heroes and excellent filming.

0307454541|4.0|This is not the first Swedish detective novel that I have read. For whatever reason, I found several Swedish detective authors prior to Larsson, and enjoyed them. Not surprisingly, when this book gained such widespread popularity, I had to take a look. While I think that it is fun, I think it is overrated as well. Whereas most Swedish detective novels differ from the US variety in that they tend to be grounded, with an emphasis on teamwork and procedure, the Larsson series is more American in its approach. By this I mean that there are more improbable plot twists and more instances where \\"a brave loner beats the odds and shakes the system\\". While I do enjoy the more typically Swedish style of Mankell or Eriksson, I understand that many more people enjoy the rollercoaster pace of the Larsson books. If I were to guess, I would imagine that readers who enjoyed the twists, turns, and fast pace of Dan Brown's books will be very happy with this series as well.

0061673730|5.0|Reading \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" require great peace of mind.  This book was clearly the work of a a passionate author, who was given the well-disguised gift of hundreds of rejections from publishers -- that forced him to refine his text, to clarify his ideas, to remove all that was unnecessary, until what remains is as raw distillation of ideas that almost magically is also engrossing.    As an aside, the book parallels my life in many ways.  I was first introduced to it while my father was reading it, on a long, slow trip through the upper midwest, following much the same route that Pirsig describes.  Later, reading it for the first time in college, I read it a few pages at a time over a few months, much as Pirsig describes reading Walden to his son.  I myself was given the well disguised gift of being kicked out of school, forced to work for a few years, then returned to school with all the fire and enthusiasm of the student described in the middle of the book.  Finally, my work is in computer-generated visual effects in movies, you could not find a career that more closely models the classic/romantic split that is ZAMM.    There are so many things about the book that I love, but what is common to all of them is that it encourages you to step outside your little world-view, and ask foundational questions.  So much of what passes for society these days depends on everybody coming to the consensus answer to these questions that nobody even recognizes that the questions exist anymore.  When the author says (paraphrasing) when somebody says something doesn't make sense -- maybe the problem is with the \\"sense\\", maybe the problem is with reason itself?  When Pirsig describes Euclidian geometry as \\"convenient\\" rather than \\"true\\", it literally knocked me off my feet.  Over and over within the book there are these sucker-punches, these short phrases that when you stop and think of them, are absolutely devastating.  (Of course, the narrator is sucker-punched exactly the same way by his secretary, and just barely survives -- clearly not a coincidence.)    Looking back on this book today, one thing that strikes me is the reversal of roles with respect to science and technology.  Back in his day (especially as he was writing the book in the late sixties, early seventies) there was a war between the science-loving engineering squares, and the hippies who just wanted to \\"dig it, man\\".  And today, if you look at the politics of science, it's the hippies who are promoting science (espeically environmental science, but really all science) and the squares who are rejecting it.  Reading this book is the best introduction to the scientific method that I can imagine.    One of the review-quotes at the beginning of my edition said that \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is one Harley of a book\\"; that's a better summation than I could do myself.  Read it.  And then read it again.  Then give the copy to somebody else who needs it.
B002ZG99N6|3.0|I'm not a fan of bank robbery movies, but The Town got 94% on Rotten Tomatoes so I figured something must really set it apart from other bank robbery movies. Wrong. There's nothing bad about The Town. It's well-made and well-acted. But who cares? It's just another bank robbery movie, with one new element. The one new element is that one of the bank robbers (Ben Affleck) takes a liking to a potential witness (Rebecca Hall) after \\"accidentally\\" running into her so he can find out how much she knows. Yet, there are so many elements that, if you're older, you've seen in other movies, you won't be able to stop thinking of them. There are the nuns' outfits with the presidents' faces. There's the loyal friend who once saved Ben's life, who now thinks Ben owes him. There's the desire to get out of the business completely, but being forced to make one last heist. There's the level-headed leader of the gang with the out-of-control underlings. There's the idea that you have to be able to walk away from a bad situation. The list of regurgitated elements goes on and on and on. The Town is a good showcase of Affleck's skills as a director, but that's what it seems like: an exercise. If you've seen Heat, skip this. If you haven't, see Heat first, then skip this. Only if you're a rabid bank robbery movie fan or rabid fan of one of the elements involved will this be worth your time.    Another film this movie regurgitates elements from and that I liked more was Point Break. See Point Break and Heat, then see if The Town is worth your time.
B003Y5H51K|5.0|You know this is a James Cameron movie when it has to do with underwater shots and the fight for survival.<br /> Professional cave explorers have a taste for adventure. This cave has an opening, much bigger than the hole you saw in [[ASIN:B001PPLIEG Quantum of Solace]] (2008). The cave is so deep, much of it is still unexplored. The explorers enter the cave from atop the humoungeous sink hole that took hundreds of years to form.  With mountain climbing experience, it's a free for all down to the deep water below. They know that it has taken thousands of years for the water to work its way out to the sea.  When a cyclone-type storm is headed their way, they know they must get out of that cave, but they are too deep down inside. The chamber they are in will fill with water.  They all must find another way out.<br /><br />In the cast: Ioan Gruffudd, Richard Roxburgh, Rhys Wakefield, Alice Parkinson, Cramer Cain, Dan Wyllie, Christopher Baker, John Garvin.<br /><br />Filmed in Australia.<br /><br /> This movie is a must-see in reaL D))3D, so you must bring your reaL D))3D glasses.<br />Note: Even if you have your own glasses, you still have to pay for the premium.

0307454541|2.0|I was unable to get into this one after about 100 pages. The names of the characters are hard to pronounce making it hard to remember who was who. If you lived or familiar with where the book takes place then all the descriptions and names of towns would be more interesting. Otherwise, it was hard to imagine. Lastly, it just did not capture my attention. Not sure what all the fuss is about.

0061726826|5.0|***This review may contain spoilers (Of this book and the \\"Uglies\\" trilogy)***<br /><br />It's been a number of years since I read I last read Scott Westerfield's \\"Uglies\\" series and over time I have obviously forgotten details here and there, but after reading \\"Delirium\\" I feel like a lot of what I forgot about the \\"Uglies\\" series is coming back to me. Now you may be thinking, \\"Huh? How in the world would that happen?\\" Well because \\"Delirium\\" is so entirely similar to the \\"Uglies\\" series.<br /><br />Both stories revolve around a Dystopian world where the government is trying to control its people in crazy ways. In the \\"Uglies\\" trilogy when someone hits the age of 16 they become \\"pretty\\" through ridiculous amounts of plastic surgery and whatnot (and they unknowingly become somewhat dumber/ have their thinking dimmed down in order to keep them like sheep, unable to think for themselves/ unable to rebel against the government). In \\"Delirium\\" when someone hits the age of 18 they are \\"cured\\", a procedure which makes them unable to contract amor deliria nervosa, better known as love. Their government has entirely convinced then that love is the root of all evil, from love comes jealously, hate, and the likes of and such emotions lead to unrest, death, pretty much everything but the apocalypse (or who knows, they probably do think that love will led to the apocalypse).<br /><br />And then there is the characters. In the \\"Uglies\\" series Shay starts to question the world around her and brings to the attention of the main character Tally that all is not as what it appears to be. She begins to opens Tally's eyes up to a whole new world around her and encourages her to partake in illegal activities in which the both of them couple get in major trouble for. In \\"Delirium\\" Hana also starts to question the world around her and shows main character Lena that their life has so much more to offer them- like Shay, Hana encourages Lena to partake in illegal activities. Both Tally and Lena cannot wait until the day that they can have their procedures... That is, until they meet a boy...<br /><br />The boys...? Both boys are rebels, they live outside of the world that the government has created, they are \\"wild', \\"dangerous\\" and totally \\"off-limits\\". In \\"Uglies\\" David in born in the Smoke, the world outside of the government created world, from rebel parents- those who fled from the controlled world. He has is still an \\"ugly\\" as he never had the procedure to make him \\"pretty\\". Alex in \\"Delirium\\" was also born in the world outside of the government created one- the Wild, to parents who had fled from said government created world. He also has never underwent his procedure- the procedure to cure him from love. Both boys stand for everything that the governments hate and fear.<br /><br />As for the differences between the two books? Well, they exist, but in my opinion the similarities far outweigh them. That being said, I do think that many people will enjoy \\"Delirium\\"- though I am sure that there are some hardcore \\"Uglies\\" fans out there who will be shaking their fists at Lauren yelling \\"You completely copied Scott's book!\\" Thankfully, I am not one of those people. I can read countless vampire/ werewolf/ witch/ whatever stories whose plot lines have been overplayed again and again and never get sick of them. But what I wonder (and I don't mean this in a mean way whatsoever I am honestly just curious) is what is Lauren Oliver's opinion in this whole matter? Had she read the \\"Uglies\\" trilogy prior to penning this novel? Was she aware that her book seems entirely reminiscent of the \\"Uglies\\" trilogy?<br /><br />When all is said and done I much say that overall I prefer the characters of \\"Delirium's\\" over \\"Uglies\\". I feel like Alex's personality was a gazillion more-there than David's was. And I couldn't stand Shay whatsoever in the \\"Uglies\\" trilogy (I'd say that if I had to pick one turn-off from that series, it'd be her), but I really liked Hana. I thinkthat \\"Delirium\\" is a lot softer of a book and that those who love romance will love this book...at those who love romance will love this book...

B000VNMMQG|5.0|This movie chronicles the efforts of William Wilberforce to end the slave trade within the British Empire.  Emotionally stirring with stunning cinematography--the viewer is so caught up in the decades long struggle that the outcome almost seems in doubt.  The supporting cast is superb.  Albert Finney as John Newton--reformed slaver and penitent clergyman (the author of the hymn from which the movie derives its name).  Michael Gambon as Charles James Fox--the consummate British politician.  Toby Jones as the Duke of Clarence--who in life was able to crank out 10 illegitimate children but when he ascended to the throne in 1830 as William IV left no legitimate heirs forfeiting the crown to his niece Victoria. Benedict Cumberbatch as the over-zealous William Pitt the Younger (prime minister at 24).  The chief antagonist of Wilberforce in the House of Commons is the nefarious Banastre Tarleton (deftly portrayed by Ciaran Hinds).  Tarleton was the least popular officer in the British Army during the American Revolutionary War.  He was, no doubt, the inspiration for the fictional Colonel Tavington in Mel Gibson's \\"The Patriot\\".  Like Tavington, Tarleton commanded the British light cavalry at the Battle of Cowpens--but unlike his doppelganger, Tarleton survived the battle (only because Mel Gibson wasn't present to dispatch him) and after the war was elected to Parliament from Liverpool.  The movie not only chronicles the fight against slavery, but also gives the viewer a feel for the political environment in Britain from 1780 to roughly 1806--the disharmony following the American Revolution, the hysteria over the French Revolution, etc.

It's sparky, weird, and a lot of fun to listen to. So many interesting beats to enjoy. So many landscapes to frolic in.  Radiohead has pretty much reached the can-do-no-wrong status in my eyes so my opinion is far from critical. But if you are already a fan, get a hold of this album a.s.a.p.
030726999X|5.0|I could have enjoyed a lot more of his writing.  I enjoyed the series so much that as soon as I was done and went back and read it again.  His characters had flaws and interesting and varied perspectives.  So much more real in many ways that characters in many of the current crop of action figures.  And strangely enough, one of the most appealing parts of the books was the various foods (and coffees) that were so different from what Americans enjoy in their usual cuisine.<br /><br />Larsson ties up the loose ends neatly and in a fashion which is both dramatic and a little too neatly (life is usually not).  Without giving away the series, the method of dealing with Lisbeth's father was very surprising and really changed the direction and flow of the story.

In almost every scene, it was tough to take eyes off him, even when joined in scenes by any of the gorgeous females picked to surround him.<br /><br />Alex has matured in acting ability from [[ASIN:B000MR9C46 Tom Brown's Schooldays]] [age 13] & [[ASIN:B000JBWWPQ Alex Rider - Operation Stormbreaker (Widescreen Edition)]] [age 15].  Working with great British actors in those, Alex clearly did not squander absorbing advice & learning acting choices from them. [Both films available on Netflix & Amazon.com]<br /><br />*  Alex Pettyfer has a lithe sense of quiet movement; capably showing fitting emotion through facial expression, body language, & movement.<br /><br />The rest of the cast are well positioned for their roles, and hopefully, subsequent sequels. I AM NUMBER FOUR easily shows up 200-mil-plus effects-laden, plummeting paper weights. Let's hope that Steven Spielberg & Michael Bay stay aboard for a `next in the series' film...soon...while the actors are young enough to continue their roles.<br /><br />*  I AM NUMBER FOUR imprints on watchers like the first Star Wars; resonating with audiences on first viewing, & then returning for second & future showings. Don't miss I AM NUMBER FOUR on a BIG screen in a movie theater.
B00361DR4Q|5.0|Excellent quality and unbelievable price (I bought the disks from Amazon and always do so when there is a choice).
0735619670|5.0|I'm graduating from college with a degree in Computer Science soon, and this book is everything we've learned in class from our design courses and then some.  I'm no coding ninja, and I picked this book up to improve my coding style before I went too far down the wrong path.  If you've coded anything before the author's tips are that much more useful because you can say \\"I remember that project had this issue, this is how we could have potentially avoided it.\\"    I love the checklists the author gives you.  I only wished the checklists (copied on the companion site) were nice PDFs you could print out.  In the book itself it's 2 pages, but I suppose you could spend 10 min to copy it all in to a Word document.      The author makes references to further readings at the end of each section along with a short description of each book, which is useful if you wanted to go more in-depth in the topic.    Even if you don't read it cover to cover, you can still read individual chapters as needed.  It can definitely be used as a quick reference later on.
0307593525|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday.  The day after she made one of the meals from this book, I proposed to her.  It was that good.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|Great lens hood, I like how it fits securely on and can be placed reversed to make it easier to put away your lens/camera. Only gripe I have (as long as others) is the pricing. This looks more like a $10-$12 item. Oh well, thanks to the Nikon branding I guess. Good buy nonetheless. Helps protect your lens a little further incase you bump your lens against a wall, but also helps with lens flaring (good for overall shooting and long exposure shots). I'd recommend this item.
0780020685|4.0|When I was searching around for an accurate depiction of the Edo period in Japanese history, I stumbled across this movie. It was described, in one review, as a \\"Japanese classic.\\" That piqued my interest. I popped it into my DVD player one afternoon, planning on a quick preview before showing it to my students, and sat back to see what \\"Japanese classic\\" was actually supposed to mean.<br /><br />Short answer:<br />It is lengthy, just like some of our own western classics (think Casablanca).<br />The sound & picture were not remastered when they were put on DVD.<br />Someone who does not already have an appreciation for (or at least a rudimentary understanding of) the idiosyncratic nature of Japanese culture would not appreciate it.<br />If you're looking for a typical drama about samurai, you would be disappointed.<br /><br />Long answer:<br />Characterisation is brilliant. It explores all the facets of a crumbling samurai legacy, then juxtaposes samurai intelligence and discipline against both the stereotype and the convoluted truths of a farming village. The drama is perfectly balanced with humour, albeit Japanese humour will likely be lost on most western viewers. The behaviour of each character paints a perfect picture of a late-Edo period worldview and the conflict of values. However, in order to actually draw that understanding from the movie, one must recognise that the melodrama and over-acting of some roles is part of both the stereotypes being portrayed and part of the symbolic style of classic Japanese theatre. Without that knowledge, it would be easy to mistake this movie as just being \\"old, with bad acting.\\"<br /><br />In summary:<br />Well worth the purchase, but not suitable to show my students due to the amount of pre-viewing education I would need to do.
B004A8ZX28|3.0|First of all, \\"Unknown\\" is a good movie. Fifteen years ago, Harrison Ford could have seamlessly shifted into this role and done a good job with it. That is probably the biggest fault in this film: the character doesn't seem like Liam until the very end. After the huge success of \\"Taken\\" (just about any guy you talk to will tell you it's in their list of favorite films), he had set himself up as this brooding action character. More subdued yet brutal than Jason Statham, he could have easily stepped into any action role at this point as the quiet killer and made the movie his. Unfortunately, in this film he is not playing the trained killer so much as the helpless victim trying to get his life back.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, after the plot twist at the end of the film, it gets really good and reminds you why you came to see the film. The problem is getting to that point. If the plot twist had occurred an hour into the movie to give you 45 minutes of Liam being cool, I could have enjoyed it more. Likewise, a character actor like Harrison Ford (in his day) could have made this a good film. Instead, I kept waiting for Liam to break some bad guy's bones like \\"Taken\\", and it was just a very long time coming. I found myself looking at my watch several times into the film.<br /><br />It's not really the movie goer's fault for expecting this action. The trailers for the film make it look like a follow-up to \\"Taken\\" (or at least in the same action vein) and even the movie poster gives us a gun-toting Liam looking ready to kill...and instead we get this Hitchcockian thriller with a little action at the end. Marketed differently, this movie could have done better with lower expectations. Pushing it off as an action thriller isn't fair to it.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I had seen this movie before I bought it, but it was just as good as I remember. Often under rated and forgotten, I think it may be the best of Jane Austen's works. The movie was done very well and followed the book to the T.   My husband would not watch it with me however.
B004NSULHM|3.0|Just finished listening to the digital version, which is now available for download. I'll preface by saying I've been a big Radiohead fan since Pablo Honey was released, and each new album since then has generally taken a couple of weeks to really appreciate. Maybe that will be the case this time, too. But I'm going to go out on a limb and say Radiohead may have hit a wall this time. The album is a continuation of the band's quasi-experimental electronica style, but feels a little flat to me. It has its moments -- and \\"Codex\\" was a nice piece of music to listen to in a dark room with the family in bed -- but overall I'm not feeling too enthusiastic. Reminds me of Aphex Twin's  \\"26 Mixes for Cash,\\" if you know what I mean. Maybe my expectations with Radiohead are too high. Maybe my expectations for today's music in general are too high. Still, I don't regret buying it. The vinyl package will come later this year, and like the \\"In Rainbows\\" vinyl set will be worth the price in collectibility alone. I just would like to see these guys bring more innovation and fewer gimmicks.

1400064287|1.0|OK, so these guys profess to dislike slogans. And their test is, if you can put two exclamation points after it, it's a slogan. Hm, let's test that hypothesis on \\"Made to Stick\\". Ready? Made To Stick!! Yeah, that works! Catch my drift? They could have just called the book \\"Why We Remember Some Ideas and Forget Others\\" but they wanted it to sell lots of copies so they (or their publisher) came up with a catchy title, which doubtless will accomplish its objective but which negates their stance against slogans.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I bought this headphone amp about two months ago, and it's been fantastic the entire time. The Bass Boost feature works very well, and when you first start upping it there seems to be no limit to how loud this can make your headphones (there's a ton of levels). The battery life is unheard of, it hasn't run out on me yet (only light use every day though...about an hour). The only reason I would give it four stars is because of it's portability. It's weird going jogging with this thing in between your mp3 player and headphones. Even though it has a belt clip, the included cord just isn't long enough to get it to your belt no matter where you put the mp3 player (shorts pocket, shirt pocket, armband ,etc). Ultimately you end up moving around with a secure mp3 player and this thing just sort of hanging around loosely...    Another thing to consider: make sure you would actually benefit from a headphone amp. Some mp3 players have enough power for higher-end headphones, in which case this would do almost nothing. For example, I have a Creative Zen X-Fi 2 mp3 player with Monster Turbine headphones. This amp works wonderfully for me, there was a HUGE increase in volume while maintaining clear audio throughout the spectrum (no distortion yay!). My little brother, on the other hand, has a Cowon J3 mp3 player with Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10 Pro headphones, and he only notices a slight increase in volume even with the amp maxed out.
0316044695|3.0|And I respect this SEAL that much more for the following passage in his book, something so few in our so-called civilized world will admit:    \\"If you don't want to get into a war where things go wrong, where the wrong people sometimes get killed, where innocent people sometimes have to die, then stay the hell out of it in the first place.  Because that's what happens.  In all wars, down all the years of history.  Terrible injustices, the killing of people who did not deserve to die.  That's what war is.  And if you can't cope with it, don't do it.\\"      And in discussing how the Taliban treat captured American soldiers, and how American soldiers are required to wage war, he says, \\"if anyone should dare to utter the words Geneva Convention while I'm writing this, I might more or less lose control.\\"    Check Mr. Luttrell out on You-Tube; he makes an even more favorable impression when he discusses his experiences with American patriots.
B004HO6HYI|4.0|Another winner by D.J Caruso. I never read the Ya novel it's based on, but from what I read, it adapts the source well.     This is a solid, fresh, action sci-fi flick combining a lot of elements from alien genre we've seen. The story with Loriens and Mogadorians is interesting.    The story is pretty straightforward: Aliens called Loriens have different powers, \\"legacies\\" and are being hunted down by the Mogadorians.  The Mogs killing the Loriens will also enable them to take over the Earth.    The performances for this movie are all solid from Timothy Olyphant (Justified), Jake Abel (Supernatural), Alex Pettyfer, and Diana Agron. Very good performances, the actors do a good job of making the characters very real.    Action is good, drama is good, a lot of comedy too. D.J. Caruso is a good director, so this is another winner in his belt of very entertaining flicks. It's aimed, yes at a young audience, but I think anybody who enjoys fun sci-fi flicks will want to watch this one regardless of their age.
B0028AQLYE|4.0|I was not able to use this very long due to the slight restriction advertised as 20% and I beleive thats about right.  Maybe with more practice I will use it. Warning Once you heat it up to install you must be put back in hot water to remove it. Which is difficult at the pool but the hot faucet water made it happen.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|Kate Bush and Nick Cave had a baby. They named the baby \\"Let England Shake.\\" This is absolutely brilliant. Last night, I listened to it for the first time with the headphones on. It was so mindblowing, I actually had to take them off and stop for a while. So much subtlety and grace. This album is simply beautiful. This album is simply horrifying.    It seems to me that, beyond being an album about war and an album about England, it is an album that is about death. It is about death and how responsible we humans are for it much of the time. To know that you are mortal, that your time is finite, yet to still construct rationales and to still be beholden to animal lusts that cut that already unfathomably precious time even shorter...for what? Staggering.    I've seen a lot of conservative comments, lacking vision, that feel Ms. Harvey is not the Ms. Harvey of old, that she has lost the fire of the 1990's. Nothing could be further from the truth. Ironic that the ravages of time and the descent into bitterness that are reflected upon in this record are echoed in the negativity of some of the reviews. But I suppose that's to be expected as the war of life drags ever on.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|This is a great fantasy/adventure movie.  I only watched it 8 times in a week, it has the ability to take you out of your world and take you away to a fantasy world of past.  Not sure as to why it was not embrassed in the US but it would be as fun to follow the adventures of the Prince as it is to follow the Pirates.  Overall great movie and is much better than advertised.
B004BSEKH6|2.0|It's too.... \\"cute\\". That's the only word I can think of to describe this. Listening to the album, you wouldn't think Nicki is 27.
0307266303|5.0|I heard about this book from a weight loss podcast. I have never been a runner myself. The story is inspiring and motivated me to get active. The characters are real and some are real characters. I have \\"Liked\\" some of them on Facebook and continue to be motivated by them in many ways. I'm not an avid reader but read this book in two days. One of my Top Ten books.
1416905014|5.0|I have never seen a Pop Up Book done as beautiful as this book is. It is worth every penny you spend on it. Children and adults will be amazed at the pop ups featured it the book, and there a many pop ups. Great, fabulous and lost for more amazing words.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Loved reading this book! The way it was written was so intriguing! Couldn't wait to get to the end to see how it ended, but at the same time I did not want it to end!
B001CTDH76|5.0|Good introduction to the crew at CBI. The main attraction is Patrick Jane, a modern Sherlock Holmes-like kind of guy with a supporting cast of detectives who do the leg works and let him do the free-wheeling and free spirit thinking part of the investigation. Good scenery and occasionally witty diaglogues.
1406319562|5.0|This book came from out of the United States and was held up at customs by new rules they have for mail. The book is GREAT for babies to hear, but it took too long to arrive. Perhaps a warning could be attached to the order of the book indicating that U.S. Customs policies may make the delivery longer. The book took over a month to get to me.
B0013811CE|5.0|In the way of a good novel, Breaking Bad is a completely unbelievable story about very, very true ideas.  Not since Rod Serling's Twilight Zone, honestly, has TV been so moving.  The word \\"epic\\" comes to mind.  And multilayered, complex, dark, and serious -- only making the comic moments more laugh-out-loud funny.    Warning: This thing is dirty.  That's why I'm watching it with someone I love.    But it's also Beethoven.  Michelangelo.  If you want kid stuff, tune in to the Disney channel.  This -- this is for grown-ups.  There has never, ever been a TV series so masterfully written, directed, filmed and acted.
B000MMMT46|4.0|love the band love this album, but thought i was buying the picture disk, this is the regular version, black on black, 2 sides, all irish folk/punk, so, great vinyl, just not the pic disk i thought it was
B002ZG9774|2.0|I watched this film at the movie theater, and I enjoyed it a lot, even though the plot is not the most original at all. But for the musical numbers alone and the wonderful voices of Cher and Christina, it was worth the ticket price. However, just because of this horrible cover, I won't buy this blu-ray. The poster for the movie was absolutely gorgeous, with its almost completely monochromatic design, so I don't understand why they would choose another artwork for its release. Completely disappointed by this.
1594744475|5.0|My kids love the ideas I get from this book. Even my middle schoolers get excited about their bento lunches.  They told me that they know how much I love them because no one else's mom puts the time into making their kids' lunches cute, fun, and healthy!  Awww[...] ideas take time to execute, but nothing says \\"I love you\\" like a well planned bento box lunch.
159562015X|5.0|There are many such books often touting themselves as personality profiles.  This one comes from the right premise.  Each of us is made a certain way.  We have strengths that make up who we are.  Unlike other such books this book helps you realize that you should simply find out who you are and be yourself on purpose.  So many others call us to work on our weaknesses which often influences us to be who we are not instead of being ourselves, the way we were created.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend of mine who thinks this is the best book ever. While I'm not inclined to agree with THAT, I will say that this story was very compelling. The author created this vivid world I had no problem imagining and believing in. The main character can be quite unbelievable at times, but the way he overcomes obstacles makes for a great story! It was very slow at the beginning, but I've learned that sometimes the really good books start out that way. The author lays the foundation of his story so carefully that I have no doubt the sequel will be truly amazing.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|It is rare that I find TV productions that I would encourage my kids to watch.  I had heard about this for years, but had never seen it.  I am a fan of Claire Danes and as my daughter had reached her age in this show, I though she might like it.  Not only did it surpass my expectations, but I think it is one of the best teen dramas I have ever seen.<br /><br />The Danes character is a sensitive and intelligent girl, who appears normal but is perceptive and full of heart.  Her first-rate acting talent is evident here.  One of her friends is a black boy who is uncertain of his sexuality.  Another is a girl who is definitely trouble.  Meanwhile, she is in the predator's ball that is high school, where limits are tested, nasty cliques are formed, and love sought.  I have seen no TV show that portrays these issues so realistically and sympathetically, without a jot of sentimentality.  She gets involved with a boy who is handsome, but a complete twit, weak, self-absorbed, and not very bright, yet fall for him she does.<br /><br />It is useful to play this in the house, indeed it gets things out into the open like sex, fidelity, and any number of situations that kids will face, whether we parents like it or not.  Many discussions in our house were sparked by this.  That being said, it is also delightful to watch, a reminder of our own childhoods and a window into how things have changed for our kids.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.
B00338QENI|5.0|One of the best books ever written! A captivating look at a woman who unknowimgly changed the world of science and research. I am a biotechnologist and work with HeLa cells occasionally...i learned so much from this book and gained respect for Henrietta as a person and not just a cell line. You do not have to be a scientist to enjoy this book. A definite must-read.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Don't let ridiculous reviews of this being Steven Spielberg's \\"low point\\" deter you from seeing - or purchasing this movie. Not many movies can have you laughing hysterically one minute and crying the next. It is fun, has an incredible cast (John Goodman, Richard Dreyfuss, Holly Hunter, Audrey Hepburn), is well directed and perhaps my favorite all-time movie. Just sit back and enjoy it. You will love it. Just look at the reviews here and you'll see how great it is.
B00005QBUK|4.0|Despite my irritation every time these babies short out, I keep coming back for the sound quality and comfort. They aren't overly bulky and usually they last about 6 months before they short out on one side.  This last set took only a month, but that isn't my normal experience.  Plus, they're inexpensive enough that I don't feel too bad. Also, earbuds = pain, so anything not them = good.  I wear these 8+ hours while studying in noisy places and my ears are never uncomfortable. w00t!
0439023513|3.0|I enjoyed the hunger games and catching fire very much. There were a lot of descriptions and insights into human emotions as well as plenty of action. Collins made it easy to relate to the characters and understand the nature of their dilemmas- even if we, ourselves, have never had such experiences. Mockingjay, I feel, could have been really good. I can definitely appreciate the ending and Katniss' decisions. However, I feel that the final battle/war scene is so anticlimactic. ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** I don't know if the reader, upon reflecting back, really believes that a 17 year old girl and her crew of 4, will, by themselves, bring an end to the war and destroy President Snow. But I was expecting more than a slight recap of the final moments of the war as told by Katniss while she recovers from the explosion. It was getting really exciting up until that point and then the narrative just kind of cuts off and leaves you hanging, unfulfilled- the story unresolved. I also wasn't very satisfied with how the author ends things with Katniss and Peeta. It makes sense that Katniss takes a lot of time to heal and find the strength to move forward, but I would have liked more than 2 pages of explanation on how Katniss and Peeta come together. There was no dialogue between them. Again, anticlimactic. From the previous books we already know how Peeta regards Katniss and how her feelings toward Peeta changes and grows. I don't really know how to explain my feelings towards this book, other than there seems to be something missing. Suffice it to say, this book was not as thorough or complete as the other 2 books. Overall though, I would recommend this series and think that it is an entertaining and engrossing read.
B002UZCJ8Y|1.0|I think action stars like Mr. Bruce, Mr. Rocky, Mr. Arnold have to know when to say enough. I watch about 30 mins of this boring and flat bad dialog of a movie. In one scene Mr Bruce is this 30 something super robot jumping over great distances and next he is this 60 something old man who can hardly walk into a crowd without scaring himself. Next you have have Mr Ving as the savior of the world < Sorry I only know one savior he is not it. One scene in the movie a found very insulting & offensive was someone tied or nailed to a cross. At that I turned off/deleted it from My DVR list. There must be a 1001 other movies that are for rental or viewing on TV and I am always amazed at what some consider entertainment. I give this movie a 1 star rating and I am being kind when I do this. I would also recommend it as non buy sooner or later it will be at your local discount store for couple of dollars

Appreciate the strong sense of the period in which it is set, the emotions of the characters, the mystery.  A very long book that sucked me in so that I had a hard time putting it down to get on with my day.

0316067938|4.0|I borrowed Breaking Dawn book which I have enjoyed reading, but I haven't read entirely.  I'm seriously thinking about purchasing the book, so I went to the lowest scores given reviews which are nonetheless amusing to me.  I think those reviewers skimmed the book or read selected portions.  I'm sure the author's intent wasn't as some reviews laid out and some stated with half-truths.  I believe I'll still buy the book because I am a Twi-hard fan.  I found in detail the portions I wanted to know about.  I'm not reading it to critique the author, although after reading the critique's reviews, I would love to see her redo the this book to satisfy all of us.  I did find one typo.  Personally, I wouldn't want to see Jacob so involved.  The movie should be more awesome.  Twi-hards really want all they can get.
1594202842|5.0|Chinese parenting or Western parenting - which one is better?  I never really gave much thought in the past about any specific differences between the two styles.  I did, however realize that a lot of Asian children seem to be more `gifted' academically, technologically, and musically but put it down to longer school hours and Saturday classes in the Asian world.<br /><br />Battle Hymn Of The Tiger Mother is the true story of a Chinese Mom raising her two Chinese/American daughters in the Chinese parenting way.  The level of respect, obedience, altruism, and integrity that is expected from the child(ren) is almost mind-numbing!  An immensely enjoyable book that had me pulled in from the first page where Ms. Chua lists some things that Chinese mothers would NEVER EVER allow their Chinese children to do.  I understood completely the comparisons and the clash of cultures and the bluntness and almost arrogant and insulting way these children are raised in.<br /><br />In the end, who is the better parent?  Well, that is for each of you to decide after you've read this amazing, humbling, and brutally honest story.  I'd highly recommend this book to any one, I read it in one sitting, it mesmerized me!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This was a wonderful book!  I became so absorbed in the history and characters.  I wish this was a series!  Thank you Deborah Harkness!
0060936223|4.0|Interesting read with a few paragraphs that leave you a little bit confused by the complex relationship that the two \\"characters\\" share.
1848312016|4.0|Any book that criticizes Larry Summers has to be bought and read. Even apart from that, this is a very enjoyable read on a controversial subject. I have no background in this subject, other than a few articles in science magazines, so I can't say Fine is right or wrong. I can say,however, that she makes a powerful argument that sex differences are widely misunderstood, even among many established scientific experts. The prevailing wisdom is that there are innate differences between male and female brains, leading to male dominance in areas like science and math. Fine argues that this \\"fact\\" is very questionable.<br /><br />(Lesson to be learned here: write reviews right after reading a book! There were a number of provocative passages that I wanted to quote, but that I can't remember anymore.) Get the book,anyway, my poor memory notwithstanding.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Such a sad and beautiful story.  Hosseini is defintely one of the most powerful writers of our time.  His words do not merely show us what the characters feel he places us in the skins of his characters.   They became so real to me that they will never leave me.   And though there is great pain in his story he allows us hope and helps to assuage the hurt.  Thank you Mr. Hosseini for speaking out for women and men who are oppressed and hurt by radicalism.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|The charmingly titled \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" is billed as a horror movie. It isn't really; rather it is a 2010 remake of the classic 'video nasty' of the [[ASIN:B004BLTNM0 same title]] from 1978, aka \\"The Day of the Woman\\", aka \\"The Rape and Revenge of Jennifer Hills\\". Which just about tells you all you need to know about what to expect from this production. Fans of the original will not be disappointed by this remake which certainly pulls no punches in its visceral nastiness and gory unpleasantness almost from start to end.  An effective musical soundtrack adds to the tension that the screenplay builds and the spooky back-woods settings are used to great effect.  Excellent performances are delivered from all of the cast, but most especially from Andrew Howard as the Sheriff and Sarah Butler in the role of Jennifer Hills.<br /><br />Those with a liking for the nastier variety of revenge movie should find this eminently watchable. Everyone else should probably steer well clear.
B004G600A4|5.0|I was originally going to wait for this to come to dvd before seeing it. It  seemed like all of the \\"good parts\\" were in the previews and I didnt want  either my children or me to be disappointed after watching it in theaters.    But one day on a whim, we headed to the movies to watch a different film.  It was no longer playing in our multiplex. So Tangled was our next choice  and I didnt know what to expect.     Oh my gosh...what a delightful movie!! It kept my interest as an  adult and it surely kept the kids as well.     I laughed (a lot...sorry movie goers around me.)  I cried...yes, grown woman cried seeing Tangled.    It touched me so much and was extremely entertaining.   I cannot say my favorite part in case there are  people who havent seen it. But this is truely,in my  opinion, the best Disney film since Cars!!    So, when this comes to dvd on my 40th birthday,  rest assured I will buy it and I am not ashamed  to say I am buying it for myself...not the kids!  But they will be allowed to watch it I suppose.

B000PKX2KA|4.0|I am using this on a laptop running vista.  It works great w/ delorme software.  I was initially having problems using it with google earth (blue screen).  I adjusted settings as some have suggested - did not work for me.  I ended up installing \\"Earth Bridge\\" which is 'donationware'.  It solved the problem and now I can use google earth and the BU-353 with no problems. Just adjust the preferences in EB to match those in Windows Device Manager for the BU-353 and then launch GE from EB after that.    [...]  [...]

1573229725|5.0|Im not one for long winded reviews, so this will be short. Also, I  have not yet finished the book - yet I'm compelled to leave a review.<br /><br />Waters picks up where Dickens and Maugham left off and elevates the genre to new levels. Fingersmith is a tour-de-force of victorian historical fiction. The story is no doubt brilliant, the historical detail so sound that it creates a virtual victorian experience in the readers mind. But the real wonder is in the characters. They are so vivid, with emotions so palpable that they completely engulfed me , making my real life  somewhat of a blur since I started reading. Maud's vulnerability is painful for the reader, but at the same time it makes her so alluring. You just want to reach out through the pages and comfort the girls at times, and your inability  to change anything just adds to the sense of helplessness,  making you read on feverishly with your heart in your mouth.<br /><br />I never knew that i cared for lesbian themed fiction but this book was an eye opener. The relationship between the two girls is stirring, gentle and beautiful. It will leave you with a longing in your heart that is likely to haunt you for long after you put down this book.<br /><br />I read the little stranger before this and did not think it could get any better - I was wrong!
B0041KKYCY|3.0|In I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (1978), aspiring novelist Camille Keaton rents a house in the country one summer and is soon raped, beaten and left for dead by four local thugs.  She recovers but, instead of going to the law, decides to get her own just, ghastly revenge on the quartet.<br /><br />The movie contained a considerable amount of graphic nudity, and both the rape and revenge sequences were quite brutal and realistic.  Of course, during the revenge sequences, one felt like cheering every time Ms. Keaton dispatched one of her attackers.<br /><br />Steven R. Monroe directed the 2010 remake of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, which stars Sarah Butler, who does quite well in the Keaton role.<br /><br />Though the heroine's methods of revenge in this version are much more brutal, the screenplay follows the general plot of the 1978 picture.  It does add one key character, who I won't talk about lest I be a Spoiler, but the addition of this character certainly makes the story more intriguing.<br /><br />There is still some graphic nudity in 2010 version, but not as much as there was in 1978.<br /><br />Extras on this DVD include director and producer (Lisa Hansen) commentary and a \\"Making of\\" featurette.<br /><br />There are a many extremely dark and disturbing scenes in this version, which some people will not be able to watch.  Still, if you could sit through the SAW movies, I guess that I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE will not be too much of a problem.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman

031603438X|4.0|After wading through 547 pages of Keith Richards' Life, I have to admit I'm more confused about the man than ever. Was there ever a tangle of more contradictory personality traits in the form of an aging rock & roll icon? It's tough to get a fix on someone who represents himself on one page as a crude and vulgar hoodlum, but several pages later comes off as the consummate man of taste. He's compassionate enough to smuggle a stray dog home from Russia, yet shrugs off smacking his Bentley into a tree (and injuring his young son) with a cavalier \\"Nobody's perfect, right?\\" Loyal to the core with those he deems true friends, yet mercilessly ripping into endless tirades about Brian Jones, and, especially Mick Jagger. Bill Wyman, for whatever reason, is all but non-existent in this tome. Keith champions the black man, yet repeatedly refers to women as \\"bitches.\\" Do I love and admire this guy or wish he'd just crawl back to the slimy swamp he emerged from?<br /><br />Keith Richards apologizes for little while reflecting on his many years on the planet. Not Brian Jones tragic fate. Not Altamont. Not even the toll his substance abuse and junkie-ism took on his bandmates, loved ones, or himself over the years. He does admit, in retrospect, to feeling bad for having shot up the late John Phillips for the first time, but the burden of regret seems to end there. Still, you have to take your hat off to anyone who has spent nearly fifty years in a rock & roll hurricane and survived to tell the tale. Life is full of colorful anecdotes, and James Fox has done a superb job of allowing Richards' unique speaking voice and Dartfordese-lingo to ring through.<br /><br />If Keith Richards weren't the mega-star that he is, this auto-bio would unquestionably have been trimmed down to a meatier 400 pages or less. In its present state, the story runs out of gas after the first two thirds and is reduced to mostly random musings (e.g. - tips on how to make the perfect bangers and mash). If, down the road, you've checked this out of the library and it's due back tomorrow, but can't be renewed, and you're only on page 422... don't feel like you have to pull an all-nighter.

030746363X|5.0|I am impressed with the book overall and the ideas presented. I suggest viewing it like a cook book.  You would never make everything in a cookbook but pick out only those things that are of interest.  Tim also suggests this approch, making chapter suggestions depending on your goal.  My husband and I  found the diet sections to be very successful and sustainable. It is the first program that has worked and we have been able to easily stick with in years, extremely clear and simple.   I am impressed by Mr. Ferriss' observational and research abilities.  Ranging over a wide variety of subjects, each is presented in short and clear format. While I would not participate in all (or any really) the strength or training excersises, I found htem interesting reading.

B00005U8EM|5.0|This movie is so much fun to watch, even if you have seen it many, many times.  We watch it on Feb. 2, much as we watch A Christmas Carol in December.  It is a holiday tradition.  But the movie is also an inspiration, and it wouldn't hurt all of us to watch it a few times a year, just to remind us to be better people.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Funny at so many levels.  My family watches it as much as possible, with my 11 year old chanting the title song.  We have purchased the first 3 years and have to limit it to 3 episodes per family night, so we don't run through it too fast.  Sheldon's monologues are brilliant, the supporting cast are great foils.  I agree that Amy is irritating, but isn't that her role?  A female Sheldon, but without the great lines.

JZB will forever be the character I compare all future male characters too. He was written with such a complexity and richness that would be hard to replicate. He truly was my favorite character in the series.

B004HO6HWA|4.0|I knew this was going to be a good movie when Jason Statham got naked within the first 5 minutes.    I saw this movie after a really rough day at work, so I zoned out during some of the dialogue in the beginning and missed some plot explanations. Luckily, there wasn't much dialogue after that and a lot of Jason Statham kicking ass so it was still fully enjoyable. This is such a dude movie - violence, blood, sex, explosions - and I loved every minute of it. The greatest thing about this movie is that there's no romantic relationship getting in the way. No pretty girl to distract or reform Arthur Bishop - he's a badass and remains a badass without any unnecessary complications.    And can I just say that I absolutely love a badass who listens to classical music and is extremely organized and methodical. Who wears soft grey knits.    Sadly, I'm realizing that I've become quite squeamish in my old age. I used to be a longtime lover of horror flicks, the gorier the better. Now I find myself cringing and shutting my eyes with just the anticipation of possible bloodshed. Though I don't know what kind of person who wouldn't cringe at the sight of a harpoon being stabbed through someone's calf.    Also, I'm pretty sure that this is what Jason Statham actually does in real life.    This movie is fun and exciting to watch, with lots of action and cool fight scenes. This review is completely erratic and I apologize - Jason Statham always makes me lose my bearings. Go see this movie!    [...]

B004G600A4|4.0|I liked this movie a lot more than I thought I would. From the previews it had a very Shrek feel about it, with the 3D animation and adult humor. While I enjoyed Shrek, when I think of a Disney cartoon my mind immediately goes to the 'Renaissance' movies like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and The Lion King and the wonderful warm and fuzzy feelings attributed to watching those movies. I have been waiting a long time for the return of those warm fuzzies. Princess and the Frog was an ok movie, but not anywhere near `Renaissance' quality. So when I heard Disney was doing Rapunzel my hopes soared... and crashed when I saw the previews. But the previews were very misleading; even the movie poster tricks you. She's not mischievous as her smirk implies; she's quite naïve and sweet. I wouldn't put Tangled in the `Renaissance' category, but I liked the film a lot and laughed for about an hour and half.    Mother Gothel is awesomely evil. She plays mind games with Rapunzel, making her believe everyone is out to capture her for her magical powers and the only way for her to be safe is to remain in the tower. She doesn't hurt Rapunzel and actually takes quite good care of her, making meals she enjoys and buys paints for her murals. But psychological evil is so much more formidable than a poison apple or time-sensitive curse. And really, who doesn't to want to remain young and beautiful? Flynn the bandit is a charming narcissist who only looks after number one, until he meets Rapunzel and can only seem to look at her. He has great one-liners, scruff, and knee-high boots. Pretty much the perfect man. And Rapunzel fits in well with the other Disney Princesses - pretty, kind, and innocent but with a streak of sass. Poor sartorial choices though.    I thought the animation would bother me but I can see why they chose to go that route. There's a lot of hair swinging and flying around that was enhanced by the 3Dness, although it did give the people very plastic-looking faces. One thingthat did bother me about this movie was the length of her hair seemed to be really inconsistent. At times it appeared to be crazy long, wrapping around and around in the tower in a dozen loops. Other times it seemed to only trail about a few feet behind her, and at one point it gets braided up in a plait that doesn't even hit the floor.    There aren't any annoying animals, in fact, Rapunzel's little chameleon sidekick is quite the little scene stealer. His facial expressions and gestures are hilarious and adorable. Tangled is fun, humorous, and all around entertaining. It could have been great if the musical numbers were more memorable. In my heart I keep wishing for another \\"Part of Your World\\" or \\"One Jump Ahead,\\" but I think it's time to accept that the `Renaissance' era has ended.    [...]
B003XU7VM4|5.0|I enjoy watching the show, and the book is even better.  I just ordered Naked Heat.  I can't wait to read that one as well.
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|Normally I only like Johnny Depp when he's a pirate (this includes Chocolat where he was considered a \\"river pirate\\"), but I really enjoyed him in this movie. After playing a long list of confident and quirky characters, it was endearing to see him as a normal bumbling guy who doesn't say the right thing or have a funny quip to offer. His awkwardness and the fact that he was completely unsure of what to do in every situation really lightened up what would have just been just another random action flick.    I love Angelina Jolie. I think she's an incredible actress and just absolutely stunning. However, I couldn't get on board (ha ha, boat humor) with her character. I think it's because I'm so used to her kickin' ass and in this movie she's under some rich guy's thumb and seemed so helpless at times. I kept waiting for her to take down all the police guys and start throwing knives at the gangsters. No, all she did in this movie was walk around a lot. But, she did have some great outfits. Very sophisticated, sleek lines, and neutral tones. I think it worked well for the movie and put more focus on her face; any bright colors or patterns would have been distracting.    I went into the movie with rather low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Though I don't think it was meant to be a particularly funny movie, I found myself laughing almost through the entire film. There were also some really beautiful scenes of Venetian landscape.    This was a really good movie, and I think the only thing keeping it from being great was the lack of depth in Elise's character. She should have been more sad about her situation with Pearce, how she loved him so much but couldn't be with him, and more torn about what she was doing to Frank. She just seemed to be pensive all the time. Just, \\"Gee, this is kind of a pickle I'm in... but damn, I look good.\\"    [...]

B001UV4XHY|2.0|Let me preface this by saying that I have not liked a Harry Potter movie since Chamber of Secrets, the last one that Chris Columbus directed. Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets truly felt magical, filled with spells, unusual creatures, and wizards' robes. You really felt like you were in fantasy world. Understandably, as the series progresses the tone gets less happy and sparkly, and more ominous and gloomy. I don't think that should mean the magic factor has to be downplayed, or at least keep them in wizard garb. From Prisoner of Azkaban on they all look just like like regular kids at some boarding school in Europe, who just happen to have wands. Most of them shouldn't even know what muggle clothes look like, let alone sport the latest fashions.       I did myself a disservice by rereading the book right before seeing the movie. As a total HP geek I of course want the movies to retain all details, but I realize that each movie would have to be about eight hours long for that to be possible. While reading there were many times where I thought, I wonder how they'll translate this info to film, and turns out their answer was to simply cut it. In the book we learn a great deal about Dumbledore's past, his family, and his connection to Grindelwald - the great dark wizard before Voldemort. The movie glosses over these things, mentioning them in passing without explanation. Instead they chose to waste time by drawing out the camping trips and adding in extraneous scenes like an impromptu dance session between Harry and Hermione. They also didn't have the kids using the Invisibility Cloak at all, while in the book they spent practically all their time traveling under that thing. While I can see from a cinematic standpoint that you can't have your main characters invisible for most of the film, it seemed like a strange thing to leave out entirely since the Cloak is actually one of the Deathly Hallows. I was, however, really impressed with the animation of the fable, The Three Brothers. For a moment I was afraid they were just going to have Hermione sit there and read it to us, but the little cartoon was a nice break in the film and was very artistic. It was surprising to me how gory this film was; they showed George's damaged ear and Ron's splinching in all their bloody glory, and even The Three Brothers tale (a children's story) was quite grisly and grim. I guess they didn't rate it PG-13 for nothing.       Throughout the movie, I couldn't get over how old the kids looked. It feels weird to even call them \\"kids.\\" Harry has a perpetual five 'o clock shadow, Ron is gargantuan, and Hermione seems to have fallen out of a J. Crew catalog.  All in all, it wasn't a bad movie but it wasn't great either. There were definitely a lot of moments that I enjoyed, but I think too many important details were left out or changed that I can't reasonably give this a good review.     [...]
B001974DG0|5.0|I read this book many years ago. I loved it! Its just one of those books that you don't want to put down because you have to know what happens. At the time I read this Ebooks weren't around. I passed this book onto several friends and family. They ALL loved it. I highly recommend.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|I was searching for some poignant symbolism to explain away the weirdness of the movie, maybe something intellectual and/or artsy that went over my head. Then I thought I didn't get it because I don't know the story of Swan Lake - which is slightly embarrassing to admit because I feel like I should have been exposed to it sometime in my life - and maybe there's a parallel between the two stories that explains everything. However, according to Wikipedia the parallels end at Portman being the sweet and innocent White Swan and Kunis the sexy Black Swan, because there's not much to Swan Lake after that. So after running it over and over in my mind, I really think that there isn't some grand underlying metaphor that I missed... it's just a weird movie.    I feel like I could have really liked this film, and I think that's what's bothering me. Portman did a phenomenal job as the high-strung perfectionist ballerina whose neurotic fragility is both endearing and frightening. You sympathize with her and root for her to do well, while also hoping for her to break out of her shell and own the stage. When the paranoia is too much, her descent into madness is an overwhelmingly fantastic and scary thing to behold. There's so much potential for a great film, then confusing hallucinations, eye-rolling cliches, a seizure-inducing club scene, and a random lesbian romp muddied up the waters. There were so many moments when I inappropriately laughed because I did not know how else to react. I'm sure the people around me thought I was crazy. And to be honest, there were moments when there was so much going on onscreen that I thought I was the crazy one.    The costumes were awesome, though, and were pretty much the only things that kept my attention. Portman wore cozy knits off stage and wonderful frilly feathery tutus onstage. Her Black Swan costume really makes a small part of me wish I had taken ballet.    I read a critique about the movie where a bunch of real dancers where upset that they cast an actress in this role and not an actual dancer, which sounds completely asinine because I'm pretty sure this was a movie and you use actors in movies. Portman did such a great job that I thought she had some sort of a dance background prior to the movie, but she just had a lot of intense training during filming (so intense she got engaged and impregnated by her choreographer). A lot of her fancy footwork was done by a body double, but she had the movement and grace of a real ballerina in my opinion. And if the used real ballerinas instead? You get Center Stage - a cheesy flick where the dancing's great, but the dialogue makes you cringe.    [...]

B002ZG99QS|2.0|I feel I should preface this review by saying that I have never seen the original Tron, and I have no computer or gaming prowess whatsoever. See how simple this blog is? Well it took me a LONG time to figure out how to do this, and I'm still trying to learn how to make the pictures line up properly or be the same size. So it shouldn't be surprising that I didn't understand most of what's going on in this movie, and I generally don't like things that I don't understand.    I can see why people like Legacy, though, especially since I live in Silicon Valley and am constantly surrounded by techies. But I think a good movie should be able to reach beyond its niche market and appeal to a more general audience. And I know that this is a sequel, but it's been two decades and I know I'm not the only one who hasn't seen Tron. Yes, it definitely should pay homage to the original and its fans, but it should also be able to stand on its own for the new viewers. Some scenes between Flynn and Sam were touching and heartfelt, which was nice, and the actor playing Sam managed to squeeze out some pretty convincing tears. Other than that, I was basically just looking at bright lights for two hours.    Ugh, the lights. I get that contrast is effective, but the constant switch between a luminous scene and then a dim scene left me really disorientated. And really, how stealthy can you be when you're a walking Lite Brite? How Clu couldn't see the white light streaking amidst his orange lighted minions is beyond me.    The Grid is nothing like what I imagine is inside my computer. It's just a weird futuristic world full of neon lights. If they didn't repeatedly say \\"programs,\\" \\"users,\\" or \\"discs\\" I would totally forget that we're supposed to be inside a computer. Sam's adventure to and within The Grid don't have any sense of a journey to it. He goes to the arcade, tries to play Tron, notices a groove on the floor, finds a door behind the machine, fiddles with a computer, a laser takes himto The Grid instantaneously, wins battles against other programs in seconds, finds his dad, runs to the portal. The end. And while I can accept that his highly adept computer skills were inherited, there's nothing to suggest that he would be a good fighter. There was no struggle or hardship in his battles; he bested his opponents far too quickly and easily, which made it hard to root for him since you knew he was capable of taking care of himself and makes the movie less exciting because you assume he's going to be able to reach his destination. (*Spoiler: He does.)    I didn't enjoy the movie but I would recommend it if you are a fan of Tron, computers, or shiny objects. I did really love the digital makeover of the castle, though.  [...]

B002SF9YUM|4.0|Beautifully filmed! Well acted story from Salvador Dali's youth. Film is iconic and well worth watching. Still, what sadness must have been in this man's heart for ever.
B002ZG981E|5.0|You'll really have to concentrate on this movie, but it worth your time if you are able to do so.  In addition the special effects are magnificant, and not just buildings crumbling, but people doing impossible stunts.  I'm thinking of buying this just to get the second disk to see how it was done.  The only minus I can give the movie is the actress who played Leonardo Dicaprio's wife.  She's French and she could barely hold her English accent.

The Edge...let's just say that I always knew he was good, but his use of effects is completely amazing. I have a new respect for him. And Jimmy Page. The Master! Nuff said.  All in all, I am very pleased to own the Blu Ray edition of It Might Get Loud.
B000002KAT|5.0|What a bold statement to make! The greatest album of all time. It doesn't feel right to say that, not because it isn't true (because it certainly is) but because even that emphatic point, doesn't even come close to the intensity and excellence of Astral Weeks.  This album can be listened to as a deeply personal and internal record, a catalyst for one's own thoughts and musings of love and loss, it can be played at a dinner party over coffee, a wedding, or a funeral.  The musicianship is second to none, lyrically superior to all, and what a testament to it's achievements that over 40 years after it's release it is more popular than ever!  I was lucky enough to discover the album at the tender age of 17 when, bear in mind, every other album I possessed belonged to the genre of Punk Rock. I heard my Mum playing the album in the car and I went out and bought it the very next day. I *know* that I will be listening to this album on my very last legs, and thinking it even more beautiful than I do now.  If I could listen to one album for the rest of my life, that album would be Astral Weeks.
B0000630BT|5.0|All the songs here are unique. I love them all. Its an album that will be heard forever. What can i say -> The solos? The fastest with the most adrenaline you can ever imagine. The drums ? -> This guy in this album kills (just listen the painkiller and you will understand what i am saying). The vocals -> AMAZING in all the songs. The songs are all 5/5. I recommend this album to any metal fan independent if he likes or not Judas Priest. This is not a common Judas Priest album and is their best and A MASTERPIECE. This album is in my TOP 5 of all metal album of all the years i have ever heard. A MUST FOR ALL.

B000GCFY0I|2.0|I read this book two years ago, when I was in fourth grade. I found it great at first, but then as I read on, I saw it very unrealistic. The amount of detail spent on the looks of the character made me feel as though I really couldn't connect to any of the charaters. After finishing the book, I promptly threw it across my living room in disgust. I think I really lost brain cells while reading this book.     What I actually did enjoy about this book was the overall PLOT LINE! If becoming &#34;pretty&#34; wasn't such an important part of this book, then I actually probably would have enjoyed this book. But PrettyTown?! Really? Couldn't have come up with a better title for a fantasy land, no, too hard. Do NOT waste any of your money on this book. Please.    Thank you.  Jenna Boccio
B0021L8V0W|5.0|Ok,let's start by saying all movies/shows are corny and far fetched. So watch it knowing that it's fiction and enjoy or don't watch tv/movies. This movie surprised me,I see maybe 3 a yr. This one was worth sitting through,I loved it! It has great action scenes and has enough sense not to be predictable. The surprises are what make this so good. I've seen so many plots regurgitated and can predict every move throughout. That's what is different about this one. Don't listen to negative reviews unless you intend to stop buying any movie that's over the top. We don't need reality when we want an escape.
B004HAEGP4|5.0|Amazon's online movie service exceeded all my expectations. The movie was very easy to rent, was of good quality, started with no delay and made it all the way through without a hiccup. That never happens. :)    As for RE4, it's a cool movie but I felt that they left WAY too much unexplained. Hopefully the next installment will tie up those loose ends (it's been confirmed that there will be another).
B002ZG99NG|5.0|Good Product, but I wonder if I can get the extended version on DVD since I don't have Blue-Ray. Thanks
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I had seen this movie on TV and thought my granddaughters would enjoy it and I was right. I am glad I bought it. It's a great family movie.  I had no problems with the item and it was delivered promptly.
0307269760|4.0|More beauty from Munro.  It's getting hard for me to review her writing - to distinguish a four star from a five.  She's just a brilliant writer.<br /><br />There are ten stories in this collection.  Each is vastly different; from \\"Too Much Happiness\\" about the last days of Russian author and mathematician Sofia Kovalevskaya to the haunting story of young co-ed in her first year of college \\"Wenlock Edge\\", Munro's women move through life with steam - taking it as it comes and, somehow, surviving, learning, and growing.  Something I suppose we all hope to do: to take each day - learn and grow - and find pot at the end of the rainbow that holds too much happiness.<br /><br />Another brilliant collection.

6305882592|5.0|This was one of those movies that was playing in the video store that my first thought was \\"What the heck is THIS weirdness?\\" Then I stood there for the rest of the movie laughing my butt off. I skipped renting it and just bought it. (I did the same thing with \\"Princess Bride\\"). It's a great commentary on life in general and it's larger than life 'bad guys' are, unfortunately, not too far off the mark. The great messages are:     1) Love is Love, no matter between who, and it's beautiful.   2) You should observe and even enjoy the absurdities and horrors of the world because you can't really do a lot about them.  3) Don't live your life to please others.   4) Don't be different just like everybody else, just be yourself.    For the person that questions authority and conventions, this is the perfect movie.
B001OBT3FC|2.0|Just watched the Herbert von Karajan Memorial Concert on Blu-ray. Bill expects me to post at least a dozen comments about it here..    It's nice when you have 11 video cameras and a wraparound platform that is mere feet from the orchestra to shoot from. That is the good thing about this video.  Now for my technical comments:    The video looked like decent 720P, upsampled to 1080P. Colors were icy, cold and skin tones looked a bit lifeless. The picture looked like video--lacked the organicness of film, trying to make up for the lack of real resolution with electro...nic edge sharpening which left halos around the sheet music and really showed up on the wide shots. Close-ups looked acceptable because there wasn't much fine detail.    Many camera angles, and platforms on dollies that allowed horizontal and vertical movement made the viewing interesting, however.    For all the expensive monitors (I know those HD monitors they use are at least $14K a piece), the camera operator behind conductor Seiji Ozawa seemed to take a long time to hunt for focus, often showing us badly out of focus images of Anne-Sophie Mutter's left hand. He also tried to go in too close and couldn't follow the movements of her violin, leaving us with an out of focus background some of the time.    Now for the audio:    First impression hit me when the applause was heard at the beginning: it was harsh, muddled and lacking in detail--I could not discern indivual clapping. The sound also had pitch to it, like it was going through a passband filter.    When Beeth...oven's Violin Concerto began, the pianissimo parts were too loud--it was obvious that gain riding and compression were heavily in use.    I found the audio lacking in real fine detail. It had medium fine detail that was overenhanced, much like the video picture, but was lacking in the real fine detail that tells me I'm really IN the concert hall. There seemed to be a lack especially of the very high end of the highs.. I could not hear therosin on the violin strings--it was just not there.    When we got to the Tchaikovsky Symphony No 6, the compression was devastating--the percussion was just cacophony--it was fatiguing to listen to this recording.  The sound stage was flat, dimensionless. There was no sense of front to back depth. The sound was as flat as my screen. At times, I thought I was hearing monaural and not even the PCM stereo that the player said was the track I was hearing. Mary Ann noticed it, too.    The frequency response was uneven, like a comb filter.  When a wide shot came up, I could see what my ears were telling me was wrong:    This recording suffers from the 'too many mics syndrome'. And the mics were in the wrong places. Overheads were directly OVER the orchestra. This isn't Mercury Living Presence and it isn't 1955, recording a mono 78 rpm record!    Making matters worse, there were at least six hanging mics, plus a mic over the soloist, and.. there were a combination of ribbon mics and small Schoeps condensers throughout the orchestra in amoungst the seats! When this all mixed down, it produced comb filtering effects as the overlapping sounds from adjacent mikes mixes and interacts at wavelengths of the sound frequencies, sometimes adding, sometimes subtracting.    Placing mikes in the orchestra eliminates the time arrival cues we need to sense distance of the instruments relative to us, which is why this recording sounded sterile, lifeless and flat with no depth.    I'd wager the cost of making this recording ventured close to six figures, between the $2,000,000 worth of 11 Sony broadcast cameras from ten years ago, even though this was recorded Jan 2008. The lenses were $60K a piece on those cameras, and they were very good, but the imagers were not full raster and wide shots broke down, looking more like standard def or a little better, not HD.    All I could think of while watching this was, \\"If I could have had ten CineAlta XDCams, my mic setup and my crew there in Berlin, I could have made this a REALLY great concert video with audio to satisfy the pickiest of audiophiles, like Peter Aczel.\\" It's a shame I no longer fly on commercial planes, because this production crew didn't do the concert justice.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|I really didn't enjoy this movie. There were several reasons, the main one being that the movie unfolded like a tawdry soap opera rather than an intelligent suspense-drama. It was all just too ridiculous. There were also a lot of gorey scenes involving the lead character and her obsession with picking at herself. That made me really queasy throughout the movie. Natalie was not all that convincing as a ballerina and I find her mostly boring as a screen presence. She did have some good moments though, and the movie also had some interesting twists -- though for me not enough to recommend the movie. If Portman's performance is the best female performance of the year, it doesn't say a lot for the competition.
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|With an ensemble cast featuring Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, Carl Urban, Sarah Louise Parker, RED is a real treat for action fans. It's a light-hearted action film that doesn't take itself too seriously, with comedy and spy thriller elements thrown in, plus a dash of romance for good measure. The actors all look like they had a lot of fun making this film and I certainly had a lot of fun watching it.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is Frank Moses, a former CIA operative, the quintessential bad ass. Now retired and bored, he spends his days chatting with a customer service representative at the regional pension office named Sarah (Parker), until one evening when a wet team is sent to his house to kill him. He quickly dispatches his would-be assassins and races to Kansas City to protect Sarah. Someone has labeled him RED (Retired, Extremely Dangerous) and Frank sets off to uncover why while evading agent Cooper (Urban), a young CIA operative assigned to kill Frank. What follows is an entertaining old-fashioned spy adventure as Frank seeks out old allies and \\"gets the band together again\\", including Joe (Freeman), crazy man Marvin (Malkovich), ex-MI6 operative Victoria (Mirren), and Russian secret agent Ivan (Cox).<br /><br />Right from the beginning, I knew I was in for a good time when Frank takes the bullets from his assailants' handgun and cooks them on a frying pan, thus creating a time-delayed diversion. I've never seen that before in a movie. Sure, there's the main story of under-handed dealings and a top-secret government cover-up, but you're really here to see the good guys kick ass! The action comes quick and it comes often, including one ridiculously over-the-top shootout in a loading dock involving a pink stuffed pig and a woman in high-heels and an RPG!<br /><br />The story isn't particularly original, but I was more than happy to go along for the ride. The retired super agents angle has already been done in [[ASIN:B002ZG99A4 The Expendables]] and the Frank character is almost the same as his McClane in [[ASIN:B000VNMMQ6 Die Hard]]. It's got the requisite elaborate spy-thriller heist stuff that is par for the course, like [[ASIN:B003QQJGRI Mission Impossible Three]] and even a twist at the end that's almost required these days-- but if you've been paying attention, this won't come as a surprise. Even with this, it's very hard to hate this film, unless you are a total grinch.<br /><br />The cast consists of some of my favorite actors today and seeing them with guns blazing is a lot of fun. Watching Helen Mirren manning a .50 cal machine gun in a long white evening gown is almost worth the price of admission! Willis is typecast as an action hero and someone you would expect in the role of a tough guy, but the distinguished Dame Mirren is the very face of class and great fun to see outside of her usual roles. The only nit I have to pick is with Cox's bad Russian accent, however, he is still lovable as the hopeless romantic Ivan.<br /><br />Don't think too hard or take this film too seriously, because it certainly doesn't. The film ends happily with a silly moment. I wouldn't mind seeing a RED 2 if the studio decides to make another one. A feel good movie that is very entertaining-- highly recommended.and the Frank character is almost the same as his McClane in [[ASIN:B000VNMMQ6 Die Hard]].

0307269981|5.0|I can't believe some of the opinion on here. I mean, each to its own, but surely one star? I am just into the third book, and I've finished reading of the second book until 2:30 am last night. Firstly: all the details mentioned - it makes me to picture her life in every small way - yes, the furniture, the coffees, the apples - it makes me feel I am in that room. The technology and the maths - don't you find it fascinating? I bought a book of puzzle since I started reading this book. I found myself totally engrossed in the book. There is just enough emotions for each individual characters and some of the \\" evil \\" ones created a real bound of fury in me. The portrait of modern society, institutionalisation, decadence, guilt and looking for an ultimate truth - that's what I found beautiful about this book. It is feminist - but hey, it was written by man. The struggle of a few inspired individuals with their hearts in the right place, and against all odds, the bewildering media hype - you can find similar victories and unbelievable stories all throughout our history. If some of our real historical events weren't confirmed and documented, you would hardly believe them either. Open your mind and enjoy the book!
B003EY7IUY|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has again showed us what a talented writer she is.  This book has several moments that will literally cause you to laugh out loud, so beware of where you read it!  Her vivid descriptions of the absolutely insane situations that Rebecca Brandon and her...charming...daughter Minnie get themselves into are reminiscent of those poor parents you see in the mall and quickly usher your children away from so they don't get any ideas.  This book is a page turner to say the least, I finished it in less than 48 hours.  Her sense of humor is right on point, and this book keeps you wanting more, all with a surprise no one saw coming at the end.  A DEFINITE must read!

B001N26GFM|5.0|Here we see the in depth study of how a father's work as a Nazi with the Jewish genocide affects his family-particularly a naive son. The son befriends a Jew and is altogether ignorant of the atrocities of the Nazis. The sister is brainwashed with Nazi propaganda and the fake glory of the fuhrer. The mother is indifferent until she is touched by the annihilations of the concentration camps and no longer wants to see how her husband is involved. And the husband/father is the picture of a high-ranking officer with a a cold attitude who does his \\"duty\\" in the line of a patriotic Nazi to the \\"Fatherland\\".

B0025KVLV0|5.0|In 1970 the Beatles recorded this last album before going their separate ways, and this is by far one of their strongest albums. Despite the fact that a few songs include dialog from studio discussions, it still lives up to its hype. Songs like Get Back, Let It Be, and The Long and Winding Road will forever go down in Beatles history as some of their most well known songs. I liked this album a lot more than I thought and it definitely is a change from their previous albums, since this is when the Beatles knew they had to give it their best shot since it would be their final studio album. This album is essential for any Beatles or rock fan and ends the Beatles short but productive career well.
B004HAG40O|3.0|I love the Decemberists. I have loved the Decemberists since a friend recommended The Crane Wife to me when we were in high school, and part of why I love them is their concepts. Listening to Picaresque, you don't see so much of an overarching story as you see an overarching theme involving the Holocaust and lost lovers of all kinds. I loved Hazards of Love, and I felt it was a climax in the Decemberists' song-writing and character-development skills. I stumbled onto The King is Dead merely by chance, since I had heard nothing whatever about the Decemberists having a new album, and I am rather disappointed in it.    This is not to say that The King is Dead is a bad album; it's good, in fact. It's simple, and a lot of the instrument changes and complex band sets have gone away. It's very conversational, and I feel that, for the Decemberists, it's rather experimental, but I felt like all the feelings of being blown away that I have had with all the other Decemberists albums were missing. I feel that the song writing, while catchy, has no character of its own, and is rather bland on its own. I like it, and I feel like I could sit around a campfire singing these songs with friends and one acoustic guitar, maybe a harmonica, but as an album, I miss the almost-rock flair of previous albums.    According to Pitchfork, it was basically an attempt to make a straight-up Americana/bluegrass/acoustic record, and I feel this attempt may have succeeded, but I also don't hear the Decemberists when I'm listening to it.

B0000640VO|5.0|My first experience in watching this movie was one of amazement and empathy. I feel very much like the character in the movie who keeps to herself and is hesitant about intimate human interaction. Beyond that, though, the cinematography was breathtaking, from the vivid colors to the lively music. The love story was quite an unconventional one and there was also a sub-plot of mystery running just underneath the surface. Audrey Tautou definitely steals the show here.
0393061310|5.0|This book blew my mind when I read it.  It looks at the development of human culture and survival through the perspective of environmental history.  That is, it tries to answer the question why different cultures and societies are more advanced and powerful than others by examining the environments in which these cultures developed.  So, the fact that a society just happened to be in a specific environment with specific types of flora and fauna has more to do with their success than any ideas or ideologies that they happen to practice or believe.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|An excellent concept for a game; I'm surprised that lego didn't think of it earlier.<br /><br />The items, even on the easy cards, can be quite challenging and require a significant amount of creativity to accurately construct with the blocks provided. I think that the limited amount of blocks provided, rather than being a downside is actually a positive point to the game as it encourages creativity and lateral thinking to create representations of the required items. Of course, as this is a Lego product, it's entirely modular and compatible with any of their other products - I highly doubt that these would be the only Legos in the house of the owner of this game - should the blocks prove insufficient, use it with more blocks.
B003O85W3A|5.0|Watching and listening to the evolution of Arcade Fire's music is amazing. From Funeral to The Suburbs, this band has come from quite literally an unknown underground indie band to the first stadium indie band. Their music is for people who enjoy listening to MUSIC. For people who care about lyrics as well as a sound you can tap your feet to. It is art. It's passionate. Listen to the passion in Win Butler's and Regine Chassagne's voices. Listen to them. Read the lyrics. Fall in love. I know I did.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|In 1978 when the original movie was released the movie was criticized as vile, disgusting and loathsome but not for the reasons you may think.    Jennifer a writer leaves the big city and rents a cabin in a secluded wooded area near a lake to write her book.  She hopes the attraction of peace and quiet will inspire her writing.  What she does attract is a quartet of mouth-breathing, knuckle-dragging rednecks. She is pounced upon and beaten and raped mercilessly numerous times in one afternoon and they leave her bruised and bloody on her cabin floor.  After she heals she doesn't get mad-she gets even and wreaks bloody vengeance on the knuckle-draggers.  It was these scenes of revenge that were noted by critics as vile, disgusting and loathsome.    The remake follows the same story with some major tweaks including the quartet is now a quintet.  The payback scenes are even more graphic than the original including a new way one of the attackers loses his family jewels.  The movie is sometimes hard to watch, the just desserts handed to the rapists is easy to watch, and after all it's only a movie and considering the real world we now live in these monsters are often treated as mis-understood by bleeding heart liberal judges and if these creeps had ever gone to trial they probably would have received a slap on the wrist.  So if Jennifer delivers her own form of justice, all I can say is, \\"You Go Girl!\\"      This is a little mix and match the method of revenge game.  How many can you guess?    1:   Pliers                                A-   Bathtub Water Boarding    2:   Fishguts smeared                      B-    Teeth extraction       on eyeballs     3:   Hedge Clippers                        C-     Exit wound through mouth    4-   Water and Powdered lye                D-  Crows pecking eyeballs    5- Shotgun in Anus                         E-   Snipped jewels
B0002IVN9W|5.0|All I can say is buy this album. Sit down with it, listen to the music and read the lyrics. It is transcendental. It's meaningful to your life. It evoked emotion in me. Some of the songs, like Haiti and In The Back Seat, brought me to tears. They have been my favorite band since 2006. Their Grammy win, although most in the indie rock community could care less about, is a sign we're not crazy for listening to this music. Thank you Arcade Fire for making the most wonderful music in recent history. I can only say The Beatles and Led Zeppelin are ahead of you in my view. Someday it may be possible that you surpass them.

If you enjoy dance, those sequences are truncated to the extent that they resemble 'Chicago the Movie.'  Drama?  Settle for histrionics and steaming melodrama.  Sadly that's about it.  A worthy cast delivered exactly what the director dictated.  While critics genuflected, sophisticated audiences have viewed, rejected, and refused to recommend Black Swan to friends.      That the 'Oscars' is an entertaining evening of froth is a given; still, encouraging an imitation of this load of dung by awarding Black Swan, in any category, would be ...  well ... I would have to swoon.
0143038419|3.0|The author of this book hit a low point in her life.  From the outside, it looked perfect: she was successful in her career, she had a good husband and a lovely home, and they were trying to have a baby.  Yet she felt trapped, and horrified at the idea of getting pregnant or of continuing this life with her husband.  She made a huge decision--she would get divorced.  Furthermore, in order to fight her creeping depression, she would take a trip and refocus her life, choosing to visit the places that were meaningful to her and doing whatever she felt like doing in each place.  I like this idea, and I found the writing about the collapse of her marriage and about her depression to be accurately described and realistic.    First up was Italy, simply because she liked the language and wanted to learn to better speak it, and she liked good food.  I found this section of the book very enjoyable.  I liked her descriptions of the Italian language, and the food she ate while in Italy.  The characters were colorful and vibrant, and I found myself thinking that Italy would be an enjoyable place to visit.    India was next, where she spent her time in an ashram, focusing on meditation and prayer.  This section was a bit grating, and I disliked her friend there, the folksy wise guy from Texas who gave her a cute nickname and dispensed obvious yet apparently life-changing advice as only someone you'd meet at an ashram could.    The third section was Indonesia, where the author drifted around from friend to friend and finally found love, even though she wasn't really looking for it.  I didn't like this section, either.  I found Wayan the healer to be calculating and annoying, and Felipe to be just too perfectly devoted.    Mostly what I found grating about this book was the way that everything lined up in exactly the way to make the author's life better.  She is worried about her divorce papers going through in time for her to leave on her big trip.  So she and her friend meditatein the car, imagining a petition to cause her ex-husband to sign.  Within minutes, she has a phone call from her lawyer with the good news.      She uses the image of her nephew as a grounding thought during a difficult meditation in India, only to find that the very same night, her nephew's chronic sleep problems are solved.    It seems every time there is a conflict during her travels, she simply appeals to the universe and everything is fixed.  I don't believe in this brand of spirituality, whereby if you just believe fervently enough, everything will align and you can skip through life unburdened.  I feel as though this book is advocating the idea that the author is just that good, or perhaps just that charming, that she is able to bend the will of her gods in order to make her personal life better.    Or, perhaps, this book isn't strictly a true story but instead is a novel loosely based on a set of experiences that are then molded into a more interesting narrative.      Either way, I found it difficult to take seriously.
B00005RIKI|5.0|Okay, I had no idea that this album had so many good songs. I just bought it because it had Simple Man and Gimme Three Steps, both songs I heard on the radio a lot. There's no bad songs on here and there are a bunch of cool bonus tracks. Whether you like Skynyrd and Southern Rock, or not, this is totally worth adding to your music collection! It's Awesome!
B004E547D8|1.0|This review is for the movie only blu ray edition.  I am giving it a one star rating because the movie only edition shortchanges the consumer.  As indicated in some of the prior reviews, this edition only comes with a Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track.  It does not come with any High Definition audio tracks.  Most blu ray movies typically have at least one HD audio track whether its TrueDolbyHD or DTS-Master Audio so the average consumer may not be aware of this deficiency because they've come to expect High Def audio as the norm for Blu Ray movies.  If you want the DTS-MA audio track you need to pony up some extra money to get the more expensive special edition.  This is important to know for anyone who has a decent home theater set up with high definition audio and want the best sound possible.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|I am not one of those crazy Taylor Swift fans but I do like her and think she's adorable. I bought this album because its all I was hearing about and after listening to it a couple times, I fell in love with it. I can't believe she wrote every single song, it makes the album even better! I've listened to her past albums, I liked them as well, not my favorites but they were still cute. This album I think is her best, it comes off as more mature and it can relate to people a little but older instead of just the 'tweens'. 'Haunted'; 'Never Grow Up'; and 'Speak Now' are probably my absolute favorites, well until its blasted on the radio 24/7 then i'll probably begin to hate them lol<br /><br />All in all, Taylor did a fantastic job on this album!
B002ZG980U|3.0|Interesting concept.  Hard to follow.  Can't say I would recommend this to anyone.  If one is into dreams this might interest them.  Fair.
1401228801|4.0|I really wasn't a fan of the previous Fables volume, The Great Fables Crossover. With this volume the series is back to the standard, excellent fare to which I've grown accustomed. If you like the previous volumes, you'll like this one, too.     Fables Vol. 14, Witches, reprints issues 86-93 of the 14 Eisner Award winning series. If you haven't read the previous volumes, don't start here. With the arguable exception of Vol. 13, they're all essential reading to enjoy this volume.
0385341679|5.0|I love this book.  I wish it wasn't the final one.  It was a great price, awesome value.
B003OTLVBG|5.0|Although I don't believe that the SHM SACD format on the whole is good value (they are extremely expensive) versus sonic fidelity, this Sabbath edition blows my mind & is worth its weight in gold. IMO it beats the regular SHM edition hands down. I love Geezer's bass sound on this title, its right up front in the mix & overall it brings a 1970 recording to new life in 2010/11. I can't recommend this version highly enough. Steely Dan's Aja & Gaucho are both excellent also (9.5/10) while to me The Who Who's Next was somewhat of a disappointment at 8/10. I know these reviews are subjective and potential buyers will have to do a serious cost benefit analysis to determine whether an upgrade to SHM SACD is warranted. I have owned Paranoid in every  format except 8 track & reel to reel (vinyl, cassette, cd, remastered cd, japan mini lp cd, Japan SHM & Deluxe SHM) & this is the definitive version to my ears & hopefully the last time I have to shell out for one of my favourite desert island classics. Time now to save up for the SHM SACD versions of Allman Bros. Live... & Asia Asia. I'll let you know what I think in a month or so!! I can only hope that they are on par with the masterpiece that is Paranoid!!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Product was exactly what was shown and alot less expensive that our local Wal Mart. Came in about one week after ordering using standard shipping and was in great shape.
0061478784|5.0|I love this book. I don't think I've ever read something quite so unique. The cast of characters is not one you've likely seen before. It includes a girl with a curse upon her that's made her an 80-year-old woman, a fire demon, a spoiled sorcerer, and his apprentice, so there's no shortage of variety.     The characters are truly what brought this story alive for me. They are not without flaws - in fact, Howl would be downright intolerable to live with, and Sophie too at times - but that's what makes them so charming. Much of this story's whimsy comes from its sense of humour. I probably looked like a lunatic, laughing on my own as I read about Howl's bewitched jacket that had grown so large it trailed behind him all the way down the hall. The image of him tugging yard after yard of fabric into the bathroom was hysterical. That said, I've never met a character quite like him. He's vain, fickle and extremely high maintenance, but then he does something small that surprises you, and you wonder if maybe he's a lot more than that beneath it all.    The magic of the castle had me pretty enamoured with this world - I would love a house with a door that changed locations so I could visit friends in far away countries if I wanted. That sort of home-made portal is fascinating. The story itself is a meandering sort - you aren't always entirely sure where it's going to lead you. I found it really appealing, like reading a book for children that's actually written by someone whose really well-connected with their inner child. Overall, there's very little I didn't like about it and I'd love to read it again and again.
B004NSULHM|4.0|Got this about six hours ago and its been on repeat since. Can't stop listening to it. It reaches the end and I just have to hear it again. That's got to be a good sign, right? I guess, but on first listen I must say I was disappointed. I was expecting/hoping for some brave new mindblowing direction after nearly four years, something to turn popular music on it's ear, stop me in my tracks. This ain't it. But like most Radiohead records, it is a thing of beauty that grows more beautiful and intricate with each listen.     Like many other reviewers suggest, if you like Kid A onwards Radiohead then you will like this. Eventually. If you are longing for the days of Creep or even Paranoid Android, then you need to back away now before your feelings get hurt. But maybe instead you should decide to trust who Radiohead are now, crack your mind open a little and let them take you somewhere no other band can. Having been listening to this album for six straight hours that's what I would do.    Much as I like it though, I can't give The King of Limbs 5 stars. I believe Radiohead are well capable of producing a mindblowing, stop me in my tracks, rock record and until I get it I'm withholding the 5th star. I guess I'm one of the Paranoid Android crew after all.
B00007L4OM|5.0|Women should really try to watch this so that they can understand what and how to love a broken man.  Men should watch this to laugh and enjoy the action.
B002NUULNG|5.0|This disk is freaking awesome! It's got the original Ghost in the Shell as well as Ghost in the Shell 2.0 which is the updated and revamped version of the anime. If you watch both movies back to back you can see how well the updated film looks and how well the revamp went. I can't believe some of the comments here. Obviously there are many people out there who still haven't seen the old and new versions back to back. Every scene in GITS 2.0 has been revamped with the most obvious scene right at the beginning of the revamped film. All in all this is a nice disk with great extra's watch both movies back to back to get the full effect of GITS 2.0. You'll be glad you did.
B000VDUWMC|1.0|Kindle Edition does not have any pictures, illustrations or maps that makes electronic addition useless. If electronic edition would not be updated to include pictures, tables etc it is just waste of money, don't buy it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|my dad committed suicide after 20 hours on paxil...it was an adverse reaction. this is the only thing i randomly have that makes me remember how much i loved him so :( god i miss u harry...you made my mom happy as hell...i will always be waiting for ya
0763644765|5.0|After I bought a bunch of the other potty books including: Where's the Poop, A Potty Book for Girls and Karen Katz's lift the flap book \\"A Potty for Me\\". This book is simpler than those, so my daughter was easily able to connect the dots to understand that a potty is where you sit without your diaper. Has a lot of illustrative and adorable pictures, and is funny without being gross. Very easy to understand for 17 - 20 month-olds.     Highly recommended as a first potty book. Especially like how the baby observes that dogs and cats don't use diapers... and how the baby goes to get a book to make sitting on the potty more fun.  I especially love that this book isn't filled with tons of gendered colors, it's just a baby learning how to use a potty.    The other book I recommend is A Potty for Me, which is simply delightful but for a slightly older baby!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I purchased this movie for my friend so that she could have it right on the day that it came out. I was expecting to pay a little more since I pre-ordered it but it was actually cheaper than I expected. Then on top of that Amazon refunded me some of my money because they sold it to someone else at a lower price! It was so great and unexpected. I have told all the people I know that if they need anything just buy it from Amazon. I am a very satisfied customer and will definitely be making more purchases in the future.
B004GUTMOK|5.0|If you enjoy fantasy incl vamp's, witches and demons, This is unlike other books because is actually has some interresting science and history at the same time. There is a great deal of romance to, but it is non of the highschool nonsens that most other books have.  I look forward to the sequal.
B001NLKWLW|1.0|this book was predictable! And since reading it all i can think of is my ovaries being fried by radiation and im only 14!!!!!!!!!!
B001VNB54A|4.0|After seeing Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, I'd wished Spielberg and Hanks would also put their talents to work on a story about the Pacific theater during WWII. The Pacific was great but not as good as the first two. I'm still glad I purchased it and will watch it again.
1439181780|5.0|I was inspired by The Secret, and when I saw The Power, my curiosity was immediately piqued. The cover was so lovely, the description was captivating, so I gifted myself this book. Although at first the teachings of this book may seem simplistic, they are actually quite profound. The knowledge and wisdom imparted through its pages have changed my life for the better. I put the recommendations to work in my daily life and experienced immediate, ongoing positive results and changes. It is something I will forever be grateful for. I will continue to use The Power in my own life, for the rest of my life. I am a more positive & happy person because of it.<br /><br />Not only is this a deeply meaningful book, but it is nothing short of a work of art. The design and illustrations are absolutely gorgeous. Aesthetically, it is such a pleasure to read through, and the imagery serves to drive home its points. The Power is a book that I will give to my friends and family for special occasions, and whenever I notice someone in my life in need of its teachings.<br /><br />I rarely read a book twice, but The Power is a book I will refer to again and again throughout the rest of my life. It is that good, that meaningful. I wish everyone would read it and embrace what it teaches. The world would be a much happier, kinder place. I am uplifted by having read it and enjoy the benefits regularly. Bring some positive energy into your own life, change your relationships and circumstances for the better by reading The Power and putting its teachings into practice. A new you and a new world awaits...<br /><br />~Rai Aren
B0000E64TR|5.0|Bought this SACD because of its good reputations on Amazon  When I listened to it, I hear the sound clear locatable from all of my 5.1 speakers.  For me it was a fantastic experience, because I have not \\"Super ears\\" for music, but here the surround feeling was the best I heard until now.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|In the recent trend to do 80's action movie throwbacks, many of them are lacking that original take-no-prisoners style that Arnold, Sly, and other action stars from the 80's possessed.  Well, luckily, that's not the case here.  This is full-steam-ahead action.  It hearkens back to a time when men were men and had cajones, and not the emo, troubled, cry-into-a-pillow-at-night types that have dominated over the past decade and a half (who are really just one-dimensional along a different tangent).  This movie is not even remotely realistic, nor does it try to be.  It's not deep by any stretch of the imagination.  It's just plain old-fashioned action wrapped in a plain paper bag.  The good stuff.         My only complaints are that Rodriguez tends to crank up the gore to practically slapstick proportions, and tends to turn the characters into parodies of themselves at times.  There's also tons of stereotypes present here, but given the overall commitment to having balls, this is forgivable.    If you're a fan of action-hero one-man-army 80's movies, you'll probably like this.
B0017IKR7K|5.0|I am sold on the idea that Brad Paisley is the greatest country artist out there now. It's always albums like this that convince me. 5th Gear may be his fifth album in, but he had no signs of slowing down, it  is incredible!! Every song is catchy and even the tracks that aren't famous are great. \\"All I Wanted Was A Car\\" and \\"Mr. Policeman\\" are two of my favorites songs by Brad, even though they aren't as famous the others. This is a great album to start with you aren't really into Country but want to hear a great Country album. Can't go wrong with anything by this artist, but I recommend this album because it is what brought me back into listening to Country again. Love it!
B004B32500|5.0|I have seen this film  a number of times in the theater.  I also have a copy on VHS, nearly wore it out.  Now it is on DVD.  By far my favorite movie ever.  I'll not say anything about the plot, I love to show this film to unsuspecting people.  Just buy it.  It is as close to perfection, story, plot, actting, everything, that a film can get.  Why the two stars, the son and mother, in the film were not  nominated for an Oscar is beyond me.
0670022411|3.0|I was very excited to start reading A Discovery of Witches. And I will definitely be reading the next in the series, but I have some issues with the book.    The book starts off wonderfully. There are many wonderful descriptions of setting, good characterization, and the plot moves along at a steady pace. This is true for about the first quarter or so of the book. The two main characters, Diana and Matthew have discovered a rare book bound by a spell. Every supernatural creature around wants to get their hands on it, but only Diana seems to be able to get into it. Soon, many creatures are after Diana. Matthew becomes her protector and love interest.     After the situation gets dangerous in England, Matthew takes Diana to his home in France. This is were the plot begins to fizzle. The action that has been driving the book slows down to focus on the romace. For me, the plot up to this point had me hooked. The romance was just so-so. The lack of action bored me. Some danger and action do happen in France, and the plot picks up for a while.    More danger prods Diana and Matthew to venture to the U.S. and Diana's childhood home. The action takes another nose dive and stays there for most of the rest of the book. The plot here is truly snooze worthy, with walks, meetings, talking, legal documents zzzzzzz... Oh! where was I.... Oh, yes... the introduction of several characters that will probably come into play later in the trilogy, but were unnecessary now, and cluttered the story. When Diana begins to explore her latent powers the action picks up again and continues to the end, which is a MAJOR cliffhanger.    Now, disspite the areas of plodding plot, I look forward to the second book in this trilogy. As I understand it, this is Ms. Harkness' first fiction book, so I am willing to reserve final judgement until I read more. Some parts of this book are very good. I am hoping there are more of them in the following books. I rated this book three stars for the action sequences in the book and for the potential of the future books.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|It doesn't matter to me what Norah puts out there - it's always amazing! I don't ever have to hear it first to buy it, I know it's going to be amazing and this CD is right up there in my top 10! I hope she never changes - I just love her sound and her style. Thank You Norah!!!
B001HN69AY|3.0|For the first 20 minutes or so I thought I was going to really enjoy this movie. But then it wandered all over the place philosophically...you'd need a scorecard to keep track. The movie dragged to a near standstill whenever we were out in \\"the real world.\\"    At 90 minutes or so, cutting the seemingly never-ending scenes of debates about \\"5 more souls\\" and posturing between the 2 young males and such, I might have enjoyed it.  At over 2 hours - too much of a not-that-great thing.
0740748475|5.0|Got a great deal on a great product!  If you love calvin and hobbes you should have this set!
0446698342|5.0|This is a great book to curl up over a weekend and read.  The service to obtain the book from Amazon with awesome!
B000JML7EC|4.0|I had just bought my Kindle Reader and wanted to see how easy it was to get a book for it, so I started with a free book \\"Treasure Island\\". I liked the movie but the book is a little harder to read because of the wording. It is still a good book.
0441013597|5.0|At the center of the story of Dune is the young boy of royal descent named Paul Atreides, who experiences a series of transformative events that lead him to an awareness of his life’s purpose—or “terrible purpose,” as he calls it. The novel is set thousands of years in the future in an era when organic beings are cognitively evolved far beyond our present capacity. Paul and his family move to the desert-planet, Arrakis, the most precious planet in the universe--home of the life-enhancing substance known as melange. However, dark conspiracies await his family, and his coming to Arrakis was foreseen by the mysterious and oppressed natives of the planet, called Fremen.  In a journey beyond his expectations, Paul is forced to embrace the complexities of his destiny and the terror and danger it involves. Fortunately, Paul’s mother, Jessica, has trained him in the secrets of her sisterhood and has taught him the subtle mind-tools of manipulation and self-control. Paul ventures beyond conventional perception and awakens to his profound fate, becoming a character conceivable only in the designs of the human imagination.  Unlike traditional science-fiction stories that tend to get weighed down in dense explanations on space-travel and futuristic technology, Herbert uses Dune primarily as a platform to explore culture, philosophy, religion, psychology, existentialism, ecology, and science. Through Dune, Herbert challenges theological constructs such as faith, prophecy, revelation, and salvation. He invites us on a pilgrimage to contemplate the esoteric forces at play in the matrix of our lives. He compels us to reevaluate our appreciation for sentience and attempts to elicit an emotional response regarding our own planet and the importance of its vitality.  Hailed as a “triumph of the imagination,” Dune has made an indelible impact on the world of science-fiction. Some even regard the philopshical concepts in Dune with biblical reverence, as they can provide anapproach to spirituality and a means of contextualizing the infinite. Graceful in its prose, riddled with transcendent wisdom and provocative in its analyses of truth, Dune offers a rich narrative loaded with the necessary elements of literature and a cogent spiritual framework derived from the author’s own metaphysics. Dune is both a story and a journey; it is a tale of hardship and a dialectical treatise on the philosophy of being.
B002VUFKG6|3.0|loved eat pray love.  this book is completely different though.  pass if you are looking for another eat pray love.  it is okay to read but just not as interesting.
078324228X|4.0|I think this was a really deep movie. The story is great, and Denzel absolutely rocked this role. I recommend this to anyone.
B003PAXONC|5.0|Will Smith can be legend, but this edition is even more! An affordable price for a very detailed box, that no collector will complain.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Seriously good book. I love the descriptions of Oxford. But the Kindle price? Really? More expensive than the hardcover? I like my Kindle, but I can just as easily get it in paper and save the money (I have prime). I also have the Sony eReader. Which means that if I can find it cheaper somewhere else. I will buy it there. Shame on Amazon. Even though they say the price was set by the publisher, it is $12.99 at Barnes and Noble for the Nook.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Holy crud.  I took this book from the library out as a reccomendation from a friend. It blew me away...  It is BRUTAL. Violent and vile.  But Collin's writes with such finisse that you can just accept it as part of a story.  The characters-a good place to start as any.  I read a LOT and it is VERY rare that you come across one strong character, let alone a bookful.  Katniss is really one of the strongest protaganist's I have ever had the pleasure of learning.  She shows hard edges but truly is compassinate.  Ruth, anyone?  She is a hard worker and is not the sloppy romance driven heroine everyone seems to love so much.  CoughcoughTwilightcoughcough  Peeta was pretty awesome.  Though he isn't my fave, he's pretty close.  We always expect guys to be dark, brooding, and hiding some secret involving fangs, but he most certainly is not.  He's softer than Katniss, but he too can be strong.  Gale? Ehhhh.  You can't say much without me giving away the next two books...  Haymitch!  Yay Haymitch! I lobe Haymitch.  He's my fave, him and Pressy Snow :) &#60;3  I think that everyone loves Haymitch up until...oh I shan't give it away!!!  But I still LOBE him &#60;3  The plot?  I won't say.  It's in the description and I won't give anything away...  A great book for YA's-don't for it over to a nine year old though this is the least disturbing.  My mum read it and she's doing her book club on it.  Probs for 12 up or so.  I say you buy this from a BOOKSTORE.  Trust me here-this is SOMETHING you'll want to keep.
B003UYV08E|5.0|My grandson wanted this movie for Christmas & he loves it.  Course, my little granddaughter goes around saying IRON MAN IRON MAN all the time, too, so she must be enjoying it as well!
B003MC5N28|4.0|I read the book two years ago, in Grade Six, for a noel study.  I was fairly impressed, but when I was done I was not satisfied.  It most certainly caught my attention but I didn't like the characters much. I found Jonas to be a little...annoying in the sense that he was almost emotionless.  He was bland and tasteless.  As the book progressed I started to like him more as he grew into a new person, challenging what he has been force fed his entire life..  The book was slightly...disturbing.  For example, the baby part was awful.  I was shocked that people could be so inhumane.  However, it was certainly an amazing book.  I was going to give it three stars but I have given it four due to the fact that the writing showed great talent and that it was original and well planned over such a short book.  The only thing for me to complain of is characters which is one of the things I rank highly in a novel.  I would borrow it, though, because it is eally short and nearly seven dollars ir bloody ridiculous.
1594202842|5.0|I loved Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mom. I thought it was a great read. You may not personally agree with how she raised her girls, but that is one of the great things about the book. I could not put the book down, as I enjoyed Amy Chua's writing style. Had it been a work of fiction ,then there would not have been all this controversy, and people would have praised Amy Chua for writing a great novel that did a great job of engulfing the reader into someone else's home and the diffent ways to raise a child.     If you like a good sociological novel this is it.  Also, at the end of the book you come to realize that the kids had a say in the final product, which I found meaningful.

B003Q6D1YW|5.0|I belong to a film club in Bakersfield and our last meeting was devoted to documentaries. Specifically, we discussed Exit Through the Gift Shop and Catfish, though we veered off to other documentaries, and the subject of truth itself. If fiction has been called lies that tell the truth, then should documentaries be held to a higher standard--that everything you see is strictly as it happened, with no staging, no dramatic re-enactments? This is a rule for documentaries, at least as far as the Oscars are concerned. But from the beginning, this line has always been a little bit blurred. For instance, Nanook of the North, one of the earliest documentaries, showed eskimoes hunting for seals using spears, when in reality, they had already apdopted the more efficient means of hunting with guns. A few days after our meeting we noticed an article by Reed Johnson in The Los Angeles Times with an uncanny parallel to our line of inquiry. Google it. It was published on February 6th, 2011.<br /><br />But I digress. Getting back to Catfish, it purports to be a documentary of events as they happened, but on further questioning, the film makers admitted that some of the material was filmed after the fact. I don't think it matters, really. I accept the filmmakers version of subjective reality, and I think that the film--whether it is semi-fictional or a strictly factual domumentary--says a lot about the collision of fantasy and reality in the age of Facebook and The Social Network.<br /><br />A photographer in New York gets a message from a young artist who has used one of his photographs as the basis for a painting. He is flattered, and begins a corresponcence with her, her mother, and later an older sister who may have a crush on him. He gets completely caught up in their world, but begins to suspect that all may not be as it seems. Still, if he is being conned, what are they after? He even receives a check for $500 after a painting based on one of his photos is sold. To answer that question they embark on a road trip to meet the talented family, and get to the bottom of this strange paradox.<br /><br />Catfish is very much of the moment--kind of like the other side of the coin of The Social Network, about the founding of Facebook. Catfish tells the Myface/Spacebook story from the point-of-view of the people using Facebook.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|The best book ever! It is full of great suprsies and shook from the last book! I recomend this action pact book to you!
B000FC2PKG|5.0|I loved this book.  A review should be the readers comments, not Â«rewritesÂ» of the book.  If you love mystery, stunning, who dunnit books, this is must!!!
0143118706|3.0|I really enjoyed Eat, Pray, Love and in this follow up book Gilbert once again manages to take us on a journey through uncharted waters. This time though, instead of roaming through Rome and travelling across Tibet (why yes, I do amuse myself...) she takes us into the mystical and complicated land of marriage. I have never really thought that much (OK, at all) about the history of marriage and what should go into it. While I know relationships require work, Gilbert takes it to a whole new level: relationships that require research. I loved reading through her emotional journey. She doesn't hold back and really lets us see how every aspect of this very tricky time affected her and her decisions. In Eat, Pray, Love we see Gilbert piecing herself back together after a brutal divorce (as most seem to be), here I consider it more of a deconstruction of self and the actual concept of marriage.<br /><br />Gilbert easily switches between past and present, interspersing her experiences with fact. I loved all the arguments and information we get about marriage, there was so much I didn't know before! As a researcher and obsessive investigator at heart I loved all the random tidbits of information that I probably wouldn't have otherwise discovered. This book is written like she was telling it to a friend and I certainly felt as though I was coming back for another chat. The language was plain, clear and touching. The meaning was profound and interesting. The characters (Gilbert and her other) expressed as truly as possible.<br /><br />All in all this was a pretty good book, and while I probably won't be rereading it again in the near future, it is definitely one I will keep on my shelf to flip through again. I am happy to recommend this book to anyone who has the tendency to research the bejeezes out of anything (like me!) and loves to gather up random information about often bypassed topics.<br /><br />[...]
B001M5UDGS|5.0|In this 40 minute musical you will come to feel bad and sorry for a known villain. You also will want to buy the album afterwards too. This movie is chock-full of comedy, love, and evil in a twist all new to the genre of a musical.
B0045U9WPU|5.0|I liked everything about this book! Broad enough? Ok, specifics then. I loved the way the story is set up. First we are slowly introduced into Lena's life in what I call `the before' part of the book. We get to see how the government has infiltrated everything and how everyone is simultaneously happy and terrified all the time. While reading I actually didn't like this part at all, I was bored and wanted something interesting to happen. But then it did, and now, looking back, I can see that the set up made the plot so much better. Without that part the rest of the story would have come off as completely absurd no matter how well written it was.<br /><br />The characters were perfect for their various roles. The cured were blank and completely neutral, following the governments rules without any thought after their procedures. The uncured were youthful and energetic, perfectly juxtaposing the uncured. It was their vibrancy that really brought home how much was lost after the procedure. I liked Lena, I felt for her, what she was going through. I loved being there to experience love and the magic. Honestly though, I loved Alex a teeny bit more. I think it was his sneakiness and simple, plain humanness (word?). His realness when compared to the false, emotionless Portland. The thing I loved the absolute most though? Definitely how we get to see the relationship between Lena and Alex build, and how he teaches her so much about the world.<br /><br />What I didn't like: We never really get any reason for how the society ended up this way, with everyone forced into certain positions and treatments, with cites and countries fenced off. I would love to get a little history or something about what's going on outside of Portland but I can definitely understand that for now, we know what Lena knows and all I can say is I hope she learns more in the next book!<br /><br />Overall thoughts: This ending killed me! It had me making strange little squeeky exclamations up to the very end that were so strange that the bf had to ask if I was OK. I am so impatient to get to the next book and can't wait until whenever it comes out (which is guaranteed to be way too far in the future!). I loved loved loved this book and if you haven't read it yet you need to go find a copy right now and tell everyone to leave you alone until you are done. Seriously. That good.that the bf had to ask if I was OK. I am so impatient to get to the next book and can't wait until whenever it comes out (which is guaranteed to be way too far in the future!).

B003Q6D25U|3.0|Although this was not nearly as scary as the first film, this is honestly one of the best sequels I have ever seen. It incorporates aspects from the first film and goes more in depth into the past of the demon that haunts the family. It is a must-watch for any Paranormal Activity fans out there.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|I have it on VHS, and wanted the DVD in case the VHS wore out.  Great story about a vanishing breed of men and time.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|The more times you watch Curtis Hanson's \\"L.A. Confidential,\\" the more you realize that it is an indispensable film noir and one of the greatest films--possibly THE greatest--of the 1990s. No matter how often you see it, there is always something that catches you off guard, some little shock or surprise that leaves you breathless. There is so much to see and ponder in this film, and it's all so perfect, so utterly faultless. Howard Hawks always said a good film consisted of three good scenes and no bad ones; \\"L.A. Confidential\\" has so many good scenes that it's hard to choose a favorite, and all the different elements of the film--the look, the tone, the pacing, the dialogue, and especially the performances--meld together seamlessly.<br /><br />The two-disc special DVD of \\"L.A. Confidential\\" is obviously the one to buy. The DVD transfer of the film on the first disk is crisp and excellent, and the second disk is crammed with fascinating \\"Making Of\\" featurettes that are certain to enhance your appreciation of the film. Also enhancing your appreciation of the film--but, unfortunately, by negative example--is the tedious, suspense-free pilot of a projected \\"L.A. Confidential\\" TV series. Even with Kiefer Sutherland playing Jack Vincennes, you can see why the pilot wasn't picked up.
B003FSTN52|5.0|It is hard to see how TV entertainment could be any better.<br />A convincing frame story (a spritzer taken from real life with a dash of Spitzer and a slight shot of a few other scandals), stretched into a thrilling even if soapy tale of corruption, betrayal, disappointment, hope, hope betrayed... wrapped around a series of generally equally convincing court room drama around a struggling Chicago law firm. High class scripts, a brilliant lead actress, an astonishing complexity of plot, a dash of humor which never derails the suspense. Cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me, as one of my favorite reviewers headlined her review.<br />One of the lessons that the story teaches is: everything comes at a price (there are no free lunches; you have to break eggs if you want to make an omelet; etc). Our heroine learns this lesson the hard way. She finds that she can hardly keep all her rules at the same time. She wants to feed her family and be independant, she needs to keep her job as a lawyer, she wants to play clean, she does not want to be involved with her husband's trials and campaigns ... how to reconcile all this?<br />The price that I pay here is that I am glued to the screen much longer than I ever expected. My wife tops this: she is watching it for the second time.
0812973992|5.0|There are \\"Questions and Topics for Discussion\\" at the end of this book.  I thought I'd add a few more.      How many people die in this book? What different ways do they die? Did you find all those deaths depressing?      How much did the book remind you of Tom Wolfe's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\"? Which book is funnier?      Are readers who prefer funny books shallow and superficial and unable to appreciate great writing?      The action begins in Sandymount. Does that mean anything? What is a Martello tower?       How much did the book remind you of Adrian Nicole LeBlanc's \\"Random Family\\"?       What was Corrigan's father's problem?
B003UESJEM|5.0|\\"It is not the economy\\"...the boss says, \\"it's the stockholders, the investors; they want a return on their investment,\\" by holding shares in the company, which means the company uses their share money for business and thereby the investors want a return on their investment plus a nice dividend...that's a check coming in the mail without disturbing the principal, hopefully!    The movie told us that this company was doing fine, price per share was $97 a share; certain shareholders in the company holding a million shares or so were making millions with every $.50 cent rise in the stock.    But...the CEO, the owner of the company had a salary of $22 million in the year some of his \\"indigenous\\" friends and company family members were laid-off and their lives ruined and turned upside down to give the investors a return on their investment.      THERE IS SO MUCH MORE IN THIS MOVIE THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO MISS. (I WANT TO CALL IT A \\"FILM\\", AS IN, DOCUMENTARY.) I went to see this movie with more than one person and everyone admits that there was something seeming low-budget about it but they left the theater with something they know they will never forget.      Ben Affleck...seemed so real it was unreal. KEVIN COSTNER: it was good to see you, Kevin...and you were right on Kevin, which I don't think all the time; I'm not a fan; but in this movie you were masculine, real and even sexy.  So, stay in front of the camera Kevin if you're going to do this kind of real work.    SOME YEARS BACK...maybe in the 70s, last century, the Japanese developed a company-employee model and made Toyota a household name.  The Japanese model basically said: (a) If people love working for you they will love coming to work for you, and (b) if the employees are brought in as a part of your company they will care about the company; they will have lifelong customers and generational repetitive customers and you will have less enemies of the company and your company will be cared about and become a part of the national landscape.  That was then, back in the day when SEARS seemed like home and a member of everybody's family.    TODAY THE CORPORATE CULTURE IS DIFFERENT and American business is suffering.  Today's model is: Work For Us and we could downsize you next week or in 35 years, two years before your retirement and you'll be lucky if some 40-year-old grads from Ivy League U.S.A. hasn't bet the entire retirement fund money on an offshore oil well. (AND IF YOU THINK THIS SATIRE CAN'T BE TRUE BECAUSE RETIREMENT FUND MONIES ARE SET ASIDE IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS...then I say unto you....YOU are still dreaming and have not awaken to reality.)    I WILL BUY THIS MOVIE ON DVD and have dinner parties that are bound to get rowdy.  --MO
B0002IQHY8|4.0|While not as perfect as some of AP's classic albums, A VALID PATH is a welcome addition to his discography.<br />As noted in earlier reviews, Alan's exploration of electronica is a perfect fit for his expertise.  The instrumental tracks are the strongest tracks, while the vocal tracks are not special--just okay enough not to ruin the collection.<br />As always, Parsons' knack for subtle layering and creative repetitions is in full force here.<br />I've got all of Parsons' original classics, and this one receives a special welcome---only wish he'd make more with his old crew.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|The first one really got under my skin with the dynamic of being attacked and not even safe in one's own bed and having been stalked by a demon since childhood. That said, the fact that the family in the first film is connected to the family in this one takes away a lot of potential suspense.      It is still horrifying to watch the demonic force attack the dog and move the toddler out of his crib in the middle of the morning, though, and you want to smack the dad in the head for being obtuse and not listening to his wife's and daughter's concerns about what goes on in their house.    Good enough to rent but not to buy.
B0015DROBO|3.0|Kindle kept suggesting this book, and it was such a best seller, maybe I was expecting a great book.  Larsson created some interesting, yet flawed characters...which is great, flawed characters are much more interesting.  The plot is good, I just expected more talent in his actual writing.  His writing is pretty much like you or I would write had we been given a plot.  I read the second novel and it was ok, although less interesting than the first.  I won't be spending my money on the third, though.  There are too many better books out there!
0553266306|5.0|I have always been a fan of Frederick Forsyth's novels, but have neglected to read this classic suspense thriller until now.  I am so glad I finally picked this one up.  This is not really a spy novel; however it has many of the elements that make good spy novels so much fun to read.  It is an international story focusing on the battle between the French Government and a far-fight French Nationalist organization - the OAS - which has become determined to assassinate the French leader - President Charles DeGaulle.  Having failed at all attempts within their own organization, they turn to a non-affiliated assassin - who is the Jackal himself.  This is the beginning of the Jackal methodology in Spy Thriller novels, and in reality.  However, the real Jackal was not the assassin portrayed in this story.  The real Jackal was a Venezuelan whom police officers found a copy of this Forsythe book in his room during one capture attempt.  This book led to all the Jackal fact and reality.  The read itself is quick and pleasant.  A guaranteed page-turner.
B0048LPRCS|5.0|This flick is not for everybody,you need some background education. My first reaction was--what kind of nonsense is this so I watched it again and it started to clear, then I had no choice and watched  again and have to say--this is the way any movie should be done. What I didnt like? I hated to see English-speaking people in my favored city Tokyo doing drugs and generally going down. I never did drugs so I cannot confirm or deny how  close to imagined reeality movie part is but as I was involved in meditation I can  attest I  easy exceed results shown in movie and generally speaking  meditation is the way to push your brain.   what I did like was the way director connect macro and micro, repetions as we always look into our past and variety  of men's sexual experiments which at the end is the end.
B002ZG99TK|3.0|With all the hype around this movie, I thought it would be better than this. The movie was too short for a \\"blockbuster\\" and the ending was awful. Immediately after they can stop the runaway train, there's a press conference? Did not like the ending. It did have it's exciting parts, where they had to get the train to make quit sudden turns to stay on the track, and the few explosions, other than that, this movie was boring. And it has only made about $71 million in profit so far and $144 million in total revenue. Decent, but not \\"blockbuster\\" material.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Just seeing Helen Mirren toting a gun is worth watching RED.  This is a very enjoyable escapist film full of guns and good actors.  Joining the Oscar winning \\"Queen\\" are:  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman. John Malkovich (a scene stealer), Richard Dreyfuss, Mary Louise Parker, Karl Urban, Brian Cox, Julian McMahon and Ernest Borgnine--quite an ensemble, and they give it thir all!<br />RED moves quickly and provides a good time.  I enjoyed it immensely!
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I had played Zombie dice before and thought my older grandchildren(7 and 5)might like the game.Well,not so much but the adults loved it because you can talk and laugh and not really pay attention,plus you get to be a zombie!After the boys found out they were the zombies the game was much more to their liking.We all had a blast(so to speak).
B0049P1ZZQ|3.0|I don't know how long Rick was left unattended at the hospital but I would have thought after waking from his coma he should have been in pretty poor physical condition. He should have been starving and dehydrated to the point where he would have had great difficulty walking more than a few steps. But he made it all the way home and even there he took no food or water.<br /><br />He roams around with a fuel can looking for gasoline but doesn't think of putting a pick through the petrol tanks of the abandoned cars. He collects guns and amnunition from the Police Station but no gasoline. I would have thought a Police Garage would have a storage tank and at least a few full jerry cans in case of emergency.<br /><br />The script writing is poor; the part where he rides into the centre of the city into a swarm of zombies was pure stupidity.<br />I thought to myself; how is this guy going to survive 5 more episodes seeing his capacity for caution and logical thought plus his survival skills are zero.<br /><br />If you want to enjoy this series, suspend all rational thought. However, having said that, I must say it was entertaining in a strange sort of way and I enjoyed this series more than I did the film \\"I Am Legend\\" with its equally stupid Hero plus its rabid super human zombies.
0812973992|5.0|I love Irish Authors and their dramatic writing! This is a tale of two brothers, and their life in America after the death of their mother. One struggles with his Catholic faith all of his life, the other is there in the shadows. the book takes off quickly, and brought me to tears in the beginning. There were unexpected events. It kept me reading!
B003S6T5AE|5.0|I loved the previous version of this cd and i love this new version.  This cd is a \\"must have\\" for all the americana, alt-country, rock, folk, singer-songwriter, and more generally MUSIC lovers.     The 2nd cd it's a treat for Jayhawks lovers like me, but also they show the real soul of this music, and despite the word \\"demos\\", these 18 previously unreleased acoustic songs sound very good, and there's some real pearls among them.    The only thing i didn't like is the fact that the lyrics desappeared from the booklet. Good thing i have the old version also! :)
B003UESJEW|5.0|This film seems to be getting mixed reviews at best. It wasn't even released nationwide, or at least not at a theater near me, and very little promotion was given to it. I think that's a shame because it's an enjoyable film that actually explores not just the recent economy and downsizing in Corporate America but the North American situation (obsession with property, possessions and passing pleasures rather than true happiness). That said, I understand that films involving the recent economy haven't done well and I can see why many people wouldn't be eager to get out only to sit in a theater and watch what can be seen as a very depressing story that has a lot of truth to it.     Outside of that fact I still say this is a good film if not entirely great. Ben Affleck is well cast and likable as a man who has it all until his company is hurt by the economy and he finds himself included in the list of recent layoffs, the last thing he expected given his position at the company. He is eager to find a new job and believes he'll have no problem given his credentials but he soon finds the only positions he can attain are those that he considers beneath him. Soon his termination package runs out and he and his wife (excellently played by Rosemarie Dewitt) have to face some realities about their nice house and many possessions including a beautiful sports car. Dewitt and Affleck do a great job of playing a couple under a lot of stress who still clearly love each other.    The film isn't as depressing as it sounds based on that synopsis, from there Ben Affleck's character slowly realizes that when all else fades family remains constant and his parents and brother in law (Kevin Costner) help him make it through to the other side.    While this goes on Tommy Lee Jones plays a higher business executive at the same company who is very upset with the way the company is being run. When he is eventually let go despite suggestions that could help the company he finds himself dissatisfied with his life and looking to find new meaning. Craig T. Nelson plays the head of the company who causes more issues by taking jobs out of the industrial end of the company to keep investors happy. Chris Cooper does an excellent job playing a man in the same position as Affleck only with much less fortunate results when he doesn't have the same support group (truly the most tragic aspect of the film).     Economy films are a lot like films about the Iraq war, not many want to hear anymore about these issues with the media already bombarding us. However, I would say this isn't so much an economy film as it is a film about a very specific aspect of the current human condition that just happens to use the recent economy issues as a starting point (much like how The Hurt Locker wasn't specifically about Iraq).    To me the film wasn't as depressing as others are painting it to be because the message wasn't about how bad things can get, it was about how good we can make things. Everything is a choice, if we stop becoming obsessed with things we have no control over in hopes of stability, if we stop building things up and acting as if they can never fall down, if we accept that nothing is permanent other than the happiness we give ourselves then we might move past all this and be in a better place, a place that can't be taken away from us.     The ending keeps it from being a truly great film, leaving things wrapped up almost too neatly too suddenly despite attempting to be openended and leaving Affleck's character with a mountain to climb. Still, if you liked last year's Up In The Air you'll enjoy this and if your interested in how business's wind up in trouble or if you like films that show the strength of family then this may be for you, give it a try. I hope this film finds a larger audience on Blu-Ray and DVD, I will certainly be adding it to my collection for repeat viewings.    * I hope this release has a director's commentary.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|This remake of the controversial 1978 cult classic is not easy to watch.  It's vile, brutal, and grim, with lots of blood and gore.  It is also well done with impressive performances.<br />While it may go over the top, you find yourself saying \\"atta girl\\" when she turns the tables on her attackers.<br />Sarah Butler evokes empathy as the brutalized victim and the rednecks are very good, too..especially Andrew Howard's disgusting sheriff, Jeff Branson's cocky Johnny and simple-minded Chad Lindberg's Matthew.<br />This is not \\"enjoyable\\" but it makes an impact.
0061992860|5.0|A great little book.It has enough information to make your head explode(and probably a page to help you survive it).Seriously you can't go wrong with this book.I read it then put it in my bug out bag.
0307719774|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book for a quick, easy way to journal every day.  There's plenty of space for a full thought, the questions are fun to answer and relevent to most everyone.  I love the size!  Easy to keep on a nightstand or in a drawer.  I highly recommend this book!
B0000046ZJ|5.0|First the personnel: Oscar Peterson, Herb Ellis on guitar & Ray Brown on Bass.<br />I've heard all the tunes exept for \\"Tours End\\" and \\"Herky\\". \\"Three Little words\\" is a beauty & shows how Getz is so orderly about his musical ideas. , even over long choruses. \\"Sunday was written by Herb Ellis, my mentor, & is a jazz standard now. He was part of the Oscar Peterson Trio for quite a while. Herb died this past March(2010). Oscar in 2007, Ray Brown a few yrs. ago. I knew Oscar. When I was an up & coming jazz guitarist, we used to play together in his apt.We lived in the same building.<br />I guess, if you put in educational terms they were, as Nat Hentoff said \\"post-graduate profesionals.\\"<br />I particularly like the ballad medley:\\"Bewitched, Bothered & Bewildered, \\"I don't know why, I just do,\\" \\"How long has this been going on\\",\\"I Can't Get Started,\\" & \\"Polka Dots & Moonbeams,\\" I mention this because we bebop musicians always say,\\"Anyone can learn to play fast, but it's the ballad that separates the men from the boys.\\"<br />5 stars, of course. Thanks for reading my review.
B003S6T5U4|5.0|If anyone is wondering either or not he should try a Jayhawks cd, this is the one to start off from.  This is the real masterpiece this band (and this genre)released.  Great harmonies, great fuzzy electric guitars and great song writing in a simple and clear production that makes the songs shine of their own beauty (instead of a beautiful production.    This new release adds some 5 pretty good previously unrreleased songs which are a treat for old fans and give a slightly different view of the band to a new listener.    The only one thing i have to say is: I would have make it a double cd and put the unreleased material in a differend cd, because despite the fact that they're all good songs(and i'm SO glad i have the chance to listen to them), those 5 new ones sound a little different and they kinda break the \\"integrity\\" of this masterpiece of music.
B00466H3F4|3.0|\\"Babe\\" has many good points and you can't help but love the little porker.  The movie is targeted for young children, however, I found the references to slaughter too strong.  The story revolves around a runt pig named \\"Babe.\\"  Her mother is sent to slaughter as soon as her piglets can be fed by machine.  Babe is only saved from her fate by being the runt and entered into a carnival contest of \\"Guess the Weight?\\"  Farmer Hoggett guesses correctly and brings Babe home.  Farmer Hoggett and Babe seem to have a special connection as they size each other up.  Farmer Hoggett saves Babe's life at Christmas when he suggests to Mrs. Hoggett that they have duck instead of pig for Christmas dinner.  It should be noted that Babe is raised by \\"Fly\\" a mama sheep dog with a herd of puppies.  The father is tough \\"Rex\\" who is irritated that Fly takes such an interest in Babe.  After her puppies are sold by Farmer Hoggett Babe calls her \\"Mom\\" and this eases her sense of loss.  Mama dog gives Babe tips on sheepherding and Babe surprises everyone (except Farmer Hoggett) at the World Sheepherder's Contest.<br /><br />At any rate the movie is good, but somewhat dark.  It shows youth's trust and openness to a world that is often harsh and sad.  It runs a little long for the average child's attention span, but full of wonderful special effects.  Christmas scenes were confusing as it looked like summer, with green grass and warm weather..  The location was never clear.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|First off, let me state that I am a musician, who plays three instruments, and can sing.  I have a pretty good knowledge base of all music, from Bach and Beethoven to Dream Theater, to Slipknot, and everything in between.  I'm tired of reading reviews by people who have never even touched a guitar, and/or know nothing about music.  If you are one of those people, (they tend to give one-star reviews to all the Slipknot albums) please don't comment on something you don't understand.      I was not originally a Slipknot fanatic, although I have appreciated their music since the first album in 1999.  Basically, with volume 3.0, they totally won me over, and They are now one of my favorite bands.    And now on to my review:    This album is Slipknots finest (as of the beginning of 2011).  I honestly consider this to be one of the all time greatest metal records ever made, right along side Metallicas \\"...And Justice For All\\".  And like that Metallica album, Slipknots Volume 3 has taken rock music to another level.    Every track on this album is very unique and you can see that Slipknot has really up-graded themselves.  The difference between this album and Iowa is astonishing.  I've listened to this entire album about 20 times, since I first downloaded it in 2004, and I actually enjoy it more every time.  There is not a single song on this CD that I don't love (not counting the noise intro track).  I even love the really mellow, soft stuff (although those songs took a little longer for me to appreciate).  Of course the musicianship of the band members gets better and better with each album, and this one is very \\"progressive-rock\\" in some ways (odd time signatures, complex arrangements, etc.).    The production and sound quality of this album is also perfect.  The guitars are loud, clear and tight, and the drums really cut through.  It's a huge improvement from the Iowa album, which to me, always sounded a little muddy.    Slipknot, in my humble opinion, is the perfecthard rock band (they seem to have the best elements of Metallica, Pantera, korn, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana.  They are probably the heaviest sounding band of all time, and yet they can write really catchy pop melodies - and they blend it all together seamlessly.  The perfect examples of this are Dead Memories, Sulfur, and Psychosocial, which are on the All Hope Is Gone album.  Corey Taylors ability to scream violently and sing pop melodies at the same time reminds me of Kurt Cobain.  I definitely consider Taylor to be one of the all-time great rock singers.    I also love the Fact that Slipknot is one of the very few rock bands who have continuously gotten better since their debut album.  The opposite is almost always the case, isn't it?    There is so much more I could say about this band and this album, but I don't have enough time.    Even if you don't like Slipknot, you owe it to yourself to really listen (with an open mind) to this amazing album.

B001FB4W0W|4.0|I had heard much about this series, but hadn't got around to watching it until I happened to see the DVD's at my local library...on a lark, I decided to give it a shot. All in all, I enjoyed it.<br /><br />The main storyline was interesting, if predictable at times, featuring Sookie Stackhouse, her interactions with her two love interests, Bill Compton and Sam Merlotte, and, of course, a series of inexplicable murders. The subplots are generally interesting too. The secondary characters are, perhaps, the jewels of this show. I particularly love Tara (Rutina Wesley) and Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis) -- the former because her character is so human and complex, and the latter because he's just so danged funny. (I seriously hope we see Rutina Wesley in more things in the future -- if her performance in this series is indicative of her overall acting skill, she is a talented actress indeed!) The others were superb as well, though. Her brother, Jason (Ryan Kwanten) is an oft detestable, and generally worthless, wastrel; the other vampires, with one notable exception, are heartless, soulless, and murderous...this is explained, in part, by the persecution they face (racial discrimination 2.0 -- this time, against the vampire \\"race\\"), and, in part, by the newfound power given to otherwise normal human beings. The actors portray this convincingly (if not sympathetically).<br /><br />Now, the above stated, this show is very dark at times. It is gory (to the point of absurdity [think, exploding, gooey vampire sludge]) and full of sex (ranging from bondage/fetish to just plain ridiculous [such as the 'romantic' lovemaking between Bill and Sookie, when -- barebutt naked -- he pops out of the graveyard dirt, and (still covered in dirt) gets passionate...yeah, that's...disgusting...]). I can think of only one sex scene that was actually relevant to the story (and that certainly didn't need to be as graphic as it was); but, some people will like this, some will not. For those interested, it's there; for the rest of us, well, we can always skip it. Of course, everything that I had read about the series indicated that these elements could be expected, so it's hardly shocking...just know that it's there.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, one of the themes of this show is discrimination. Vampires are faced with, basically, the same sort of racial prejudice that African Americans faced, only now it's on the basis of \\"human race\\" versus \\"vampire race\\", instead of \\"white race\\" versus \\"black race\\". Vampires are fighting for civil rights, including owning/inheriting property; it is illegal for humans and vampires to marry; humans who sleep with vampires are thought of as disgusting and immoral traitors to their race; etc. The problem with this analogy, however, is that the only vampires we see, save Bill and one other, are truly detestable; they are cold, murderous, and cruel, and view humans only as prey. How are we supposed to sympathize with the plight of vampires when they themselves profess the views attributed to them by the religious fanatics who oppose them? In the struggle on which this was clearly modeled (the African American civil rights movement), the irrational, unfounded fears of racists were exactly that...irrational and unfounded. In this, the vampires themselves profess the same viewpoints that their opponents accuse them of holding...so, while their opponents are vitriolic and absurd, they are nonetheless what they are accused of being (and happily admit to being). This would have been so much more compelling if they had shown more than two good vampires -- especially when contrasted with so many evil ones. As it is, the romantic hero, Bill, and one lonely old vampire who falls in love with his prostitute, are the only \\"human\\" vampires we see in the entire thing...the others mercilessly slaughter humans, freely abuse them, and openly profess to viewing humans as naught but servants. Hard to be sympathetic... (Although later seasons may improve this image of vampires...I've only seen season one so far).<br /><br />All in all, I give this 4/5 stars for a generally well done, if trite or silly at times, adult vampire story.mpires...I've only seen season one so far).     All in all, I give this 4/5 stars for a generally well done, if trite or silly at times, adult vampire story.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I recommend this book for anyone touched by alzheimer's disease.  As a caregiver for those with the early stages of alzheimer's and dementia at a retirement home, I found several &#34;eureka!&#34; moments in it. Although I work with individuals struggling with this disease on a daily basis, I had never really considered it from their point of view because it is difficult for them to communicate what they are going through effectively at times.  Lisa Genova becomes an advocate and gives a voice to everyone with this disease through Alice, showing the world that alzheimer's disease is not a death sentence, and that those dealing with it can still have a quality of life worth livng. BRAVO!!!

I don't regret reading them.  Saving them to read again at some point.
B003Z2LAAO|2.0|Provides an adequate demonstration of the 3D feature on the new TV, but only during certain scenes. The narration is riddled with extremely one sided points of view that the Sierra Club would tolerate, but I hope the rest of us understand it to be pure propaganda.

B0001I562I|5.0|I was so thrilled when I saw this movie sitting on Best buy's shelf back in 2006. It was a favorite of mine back when I was a kid and had watched it so much we had to buy it twice because the first video tape wore out. I still have the 2nd vhs tape. But wanted something I could play on my dvd player.      The only thing missing that would make it truly awesome would be if it had bonus features.
0780626966|5.0|This is definitely the best Nightmare series collection out there. It may not include Freddy Vs. Jason, or A Nightmare On Elm Street (2010), but it makes up for those losses with the bonus 8th disc, The Nightmare Series Encyclopedia. This 8th disc takes interviews and trailers from the first 7 Nightmare films, and puts them all together in an interactive game, which you navigate with your DVD player's remote. Now, as far as design, this set is amazing. While it has those cheap cardboard, \\"snap-cases\\" from the '90s, each DVD cover depicts the original theatrical poster art from each film, plus when you put all 8 discs side by side, the spines create an image of Freddy Krueger from behind, showing off his claw. The sides of the box are also very cool, as they feature embossed images of Freddy that look very detailed. Finally, this set also includes 2 pairs of red/cyan 3D glasses to view the last 10 minutes of the 6th film: Freddy's Dead, and a full color booklet, with side notes and press release from each of the 7 films. In conclusion, if you want the best Nightmare Collection for your home, I suggest you purchase this box set, and then purchase Freddy Vs. Jason, and Nightmare (2010) separately, if you want them.

1439163146|2.0|I'm glad I am not the only one that thinks this book is a complete mess. I was really disappointed because I first heard of \\"Palo Alto\\" on an episode of \\"Inside the Actors Studio\\" with James Franco. Lipton really raved about the book, so I checked it out at the library. The first two stories/chapters were strong, then suddenly, everything fell apart. The book turned into this rambling drunken mess of stories that made little to no sense, hardly any editing was done, no structure, nothing. I know Franco is an odd ball, but I expected some coherency. Sad.
B00012QM86|5.0|Few films convey such raw power, performance, dignity, and reverence as \\"Schindler's List.\\" It is one of those films that you will move you to tears no matter how many times you see it. I saw it again last night for the umpteenth time not wanting to miss a single scene.<br /><br />This is Liam Neeson's break-out role playing Oskar Schindler, a German businessman and manufacturer who profited from making enamelware in Krokaw, Poland during the Nazi occupation. Schindler is a fast-living, fun-loving man who knows how to schmooze Nazi psychopaths into increasing his contracts and wealth. His interest is in making money, not saving Jews. His accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) informs him that he can make even more using Jewish slave labor instead of Polish nationals. On a country horeseback ride he witnesses the Nazi massacre in the Krakow ghetto where the flash of machinegun fire can be seen threw the darkened windows, and children murdered in the streets below or seeing their parents murdered. (The girl in the red coat heightens the drama). This is the beginning of his metamorphosis from millionnaire to humanitarian.  He begins to scheme, charm, and bribe his way to protecting his Jewish workers who would forever be known as ShindlerJuden (Schindler's Jews). Jews quickly realize that working for Herr Director is their safest confine in a world gone mad with fiendish evil and barbaric slaughter. In one of the greatest ironies of war, a Nazi begins saving Jews.<br /><br />He employs more than 1100 of them. He lists children and the infirm as valuable machinists necessary to the war effort. When the Russians begin to overrun Poland, he demands that his workers be moved to his new project of producing munitions to the safer location in western Czechoslovakia. When the women and children are diverted to Auschwitz, an indignant Schindler shows up and demands their release to his custody. He informs the guards at the new plant that the Jews are not to be shot or even touched.<br /><br />Amon G&ouml;th is simply a murderous Nazi SS officer in charge of the Jewish ghetto and konzentrationlage at Plasz&oacute;w. His sport is shooting his rifle from the balcony of his villa onto the inhabitants in the camp below. Their offense might be their repose, their countenance, or simply moving too slowly for his mood. Played by Ralph Fiennes, his cold eyes, (once mild and suddenly cold-blooded), and voice can give you chills of dread. His explosion of murderous hatred for Jews is as unpredictable as his attraction for his Jewish maid. Schindler's influences G&ouml;th by thought and Reichsmarks to save lives in a relationship that is anything but symbiotic.<br /><br />Ben Kingley's performance is equally superb. His wariness of Schindler's gregariousness is evident at the beginning when he doesn't accept a drink offered by his employer. His trust is evident when he realizes that the man is his savior, and says, \\"I'll think I'll have that drink,\\" later in the story.<br /><br />The most touching scenes come near its conclusion when he tells his worried accountant that he will not be paid by the reich because the munitions are faulty. He tells Itzhak Stern that he will be very unhappy if any of them work. Schindler's Nazi affiliation is now nothing more than the pin her wears in his lapel. But his real humanity comes through in a simple dialogue when he questions a worker/rabbi. \\"The sun is going down, isn't it?\\" he queries. \\"What day is it, Friday?\\" \\"Shouldn't you be preparing for the Sabbath?\\"<br /><br />If this black-and-white movie was in overdrive for performance and power, it goes into hyperdrive for its emotional impact. The gift and the letter to Schindler, a letter signed by everyone attesting to his righteousness is gut-wrenching especially with Schindler's guilt that he failed to do more. The final scene, and the only one in color, is the survivors following Jewish tradition of reverence by placing stones on the grave of Oskar Schindlerat Mt. Zion Christian cemetery in the land where he wanted to be buried--Israel. The audience cannot be anything but moved watching them being escorted by the actors who played them, and the sound of the theme played by Itzhak Perlman who plays the violin like no one ever thought it could be played. The theme song is simple but beautiful.<br /><br />The success that came so easy to Schindler in life, eluded him in peace. He failed at every venture he attempted, and was sustained economically by the people he saved and a modest pension. His last home was a one-room apartment.<br /><br />One trailer here is almost as good as the film. It is \\"About Oskar Schindler\\" and like the movie should not be missed.<br /><br />What describes this movie best perhaps, comes from a line said by Ben Kingsley pointing to Schindler's list--<br /><br />this is life.be buried--Israel.

B001TH7GT6|5.0|I have an older \\"HD-ready\\" LCD monitor that I mostly use to watch videos. It has DVI and component connections but no HDMI. My blue ray dvd player needs either component or HDMI. I first tried a DVI to HDMI cable but couldn't get the audio to work properly. (Yes, I know that DVI to HDMI needs a separate audio hookup. Still didn't work.) I'm not a fanatic about picture quality, but in my opinion, these component cables do the job nicely, with a clear, crisp image and good color. I'm very pleased.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I have always been put off by the titles of Joss Whedon's works.  It took 8 years for me to be convinced to watch \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" just because I thought that the title was so silly.  But I loved it.  I was still the skeptic when I saw the title \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog,\\" and that it was an Internet only musical.  I thought to myself, \\"Joss has gone over the edge.\\"  So, I watched it on Hulu and was a bit put off by the first three and a half minutes and after that, quickly fell in love with it.  I can't get the music out of my head and the Commentary Musical is almost as entertaining.  It was an emotional roller-coaster ride.  I'll bet that if you rent it or go to Netflix and stream it, you'll buy the DVD.  If you don't love it, give my comment a low rating and a venom-filled reply.  Perhaps it takes a twisted kind of personality to be a Joss Whedon fan, but if that's the case, I'm twisted and proud of it.
B00003CXCT|4.0|If you're okay with the 1997 Special Edition Versions of Star Wars, Empire, and Jedi, then this box set is perfect. For people like me, however it isn't. Now, I'm totally okay with the Special Edition Versions of A New Hope, and The Empire Strikes Back, But, it's that awful Special Edition Return Of The Jedi that I can't stand. Had this box set include Theatrical, and Special Editions, I would have given this set 5 stars. As for Bonus Features, this set is great! The 4th bonus disc features a very long, detailed documentary on the entire Trilogy, plus Trailers and TV Spots for all 3 films, along with featurettes on the lightsaber, and the characters of Star Wars. One last thing that bothered me however, was the DVD cover art for each film. I would have preferred the theatrical poster art over the new DVD covers they made. Overall, this is  great set to own, unless you want to wait for the complete saga on Blu-Ray this September, which I'm sure will be slam packed with tons of bonus features.

B0045U9WPU|5.0|I just finished this book and I am literally shaking.<br /><br />Powerful. Terrifying. Wonderful. Love. There are no words to fully justify this book.<br /><br />You know a book is good when it draws you in and you feel what the characters are feeling and fear for their lives when the umbrella of danger they are under keeps growing larger and heavier. There are no words to justify this book. It sucks you in slowly and you don't realize it until it's too late. But what a ride!<br /><br />Lena exists but has never been born. Society has stolen the one thing every person needs to survive: love. Then she meets him. He rocks her world. He shows her how to truly live and fall in love. You will go on a wild ride with the 2 of them all the way until the final word in the book. You will laugh with them and cry for them. You will be paralyzed with both love and fear.<br /><br />Ms. Oliver has such a beautiful way with words. She draws you in and never lets go, even after you finish the book. She makes you feel, truly feel, everything going on in the story.<br /><br />If you loved Twilight and The Hunger Games, you will love this book too. I highly recommend it (even if you didn't enjoy those other ones).

The DVD plays well and everything but it was definitely overpriced.
0486278077|4.0|Oscar Wilde had a wonderful talent of being able to totally take the reader into whatever story he happened to be telling. In this tale of sin and tragedy, one can feel the fog wrapping around them, the cramped and dark opium dens, and the longing in the heart of Mr. Dorian Gray.<br /><br />If you are in the mood for a work of art that will capture your emotions and drag them along for a ride filled with 'shadows and early doom' (as Bob Dylan might say), this is the book for you. At its end it will leave you sitting staggered, feeling like you have been to the depths of a human soul and back again.
B0043ISH6O|5.0|When I first heard Atticus Ross was teaming up with Trent Reznor (from the rock band Nine Inch Nails) to score the new Facebook drama, THE SOCIAL NETWORK, I was exceedingly skeptical. I felt that Reznor would bombard Ross's modern scoring techniques with drums and basses and the end result would be a catastrophic hybrid of film scoring and rock music. Indeed, the outcome was a hybrid of this type, but it was absolutely not in any shape, size, or form a catastrophe; it was perfection. After hearing the haunting syncopations of countless modern techno instruments (some of which were created and designed specifically for Trent Reznor) in the film and on this gorgeously mixed soundtrack, I couldn't imagine the movie's exhilarating and intelligent flow without the music of Ross and Reznor. I would recommend this soundtrack (and movie) to anyone and everyone. It is straightforwardly a revolutionary modern score that belongs to a revolutionary modern film.
B000FC0P9E|4.0|The most impressive thing about The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is how effectively Stephen King is able to layer many, many layers of tension on top of a very simple story. You start out with young Trisha McFarland, out for a day hike with her mother and brother. Then you realize that her parents are newly divorced and the tension has spilled over to the children, as always. Next out heroine stumbles off the trail momentarily, and decides to take a shortcut though the woods to meet the trail - a trail she won't be able to find. Terror settles in as she gradually realizes that she is officially lost in the woods. On top of all of this is layered a twisted ankle, illness, lack of supplies, bugs, hopelessness and despair.<br /><br />As Trisha approaches the breaking point, her reality starts to bend and distort. Her favorite Red Sox player (Tom Gordon) is out there in the woods with her, offering advice and inspiration. Unfortunately there's something else out there with her, the God of the Lost, some sort of amalgamation of nightmares and woodland mystery that is stalking Trisha as she tries to stumble her way out of the woods.<br /><br />This book is a bit of a departure for King at only around 200 pages, but it's efficient, well-told, and the proper length for the story. It's a page-turner, and if you're anything like me than you'll read the whole thing in one sitting to find out what happens to little Trisha lost in the woods.

B003Q6D25K|3.0|Every movie company knows that when they make a movie and it sells well, you have to make a sequal. Unfortunatly, all these money-grabbing sequals are never as good as the originals.    I was a fan of the first one.    This one is about a family with a mom, dad, Nanny, Teenage daughter, baby, and a german shepard. I did not say thier names, because I never caught on to them in the movie. You never feel as connected to the characers at all, I don't even know thier names. Because of this you don't forgive the slow start to the paranormal activity happenings. It seems to start slower because the people's lives just aren't as interesting as the first and there isn't as much information about them either.    By the way, this time it's told through handheld camera and security cameras.    The movie does provide some great demon moments later, though. More than the first. And once it gets to that point it's alot better than the first half. As usual, I'm searching all over my TV screen, so I don't miss anything. I say these things because it's not that bad of a movie.    The coolest part is that it's connected to Micah and Katie from the first. They do appear here and are these people's relatives. Not, to spoil anything, the awesome connection to the fist is amazing, and why I would suggest renting this if you saw the first.    I have a feeling my review was a little too harsh on this one, because I would highly reccomend renting it if you liked the first. HIGHLY, because of that connection with it, it adds to the story of the first. But I wouldn't buy it because I don't think you're going to watch it over and over.
B000063S6Z|5.0|Keeping it short and sweet, this album is in a different vein from \\"Play\\" but equally great.    It's not going to pump you up, it's going to cycle you down and make you feel the music with your whole body.    Demo the songs, buy the album.  You won't be disappointed.

0156027321|2.0|At the start I loved the book, the part about how zoos are unlike prisons to animals was fascinating. But then it started to get silly as he became a Christian and a Muslim while staying a Hindu, and even that was not too bad, but when the ship sunk, so did the book.<br /><br />The book was recommended by a friend. I had no idea what the plot was when I started the audiobook. if I know the plot, I would have passed on the book. For is there not already enough survival stories out there? Do we really need yet another...? this one having the added twist of a tiger on a life boat, sure... but really? The Life of Pi was predicable once it became clear he was stuck on a life boat with a tiger. I don't see why this book is such a hit, I mean if it was a true story, well, absolutely, but as a novel... no thanks.<br /><br />The only redeeming factor to the book is the zoology parts, I would agree with the reviews that talk about the shallow theological waters, if its meant to be a spiritual allegory, I feel it failed.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|The entire movie is filmed through a handheld camera that Micah, one of the 2 main characters bought. This style is what sets it apart, it feels like your watching a documentary about these people's life.    It is about Micah and katie who are living in a house. There is obviosly some kind of paranormal activity going on(duh).  You watch scenes of thier life, and you really get to kknow these people as you go along. The plot is very well done and keeps the movie going.    As you know, the scary things happen in the night. They start out oh so very slow, and slowly get better. Katie becomes really scared and Micah doesn't take it seriously. That's all I'm saying, so I don't spoil anything.    Whether it's scary to you or not, differs from person to person. Personally I didn't think it was that scary, but it was a bit scarier than most horror films, because you really feel these characters and thier horrible situation.    You never see the paranormal-activity-Maker-ghost-thing.You can fill it in with your imagination or just think of it as an unknown entity. As I said earlier the activity starts REALLY slow. Example, door moving. This is the only real issue, and I was able to get past it. You will have a hard time looking all over your TV, because you don't know where to look to find something moving or out of place. It's a bit unsettling.    The only other problem is that it's only 90 min. long, which is short. I think the entity is here because I keep pressing the \\"o\\" key instead of \\"i\\".    Overall, this isn't the beast horror movie, but it's very immersive and unsetling. You feel the characters and see thier life. Ver good movie.

A couple of friends have recommended this book to me but, I figured it was like every other sci-fi book. I was completely wrong to assume such things. This book completely blew me out of the water. I have never read a book as fast as Ender's Game. I completely loved this book and I can see myself in the future picking it up and reading and loving the 2nd or 3rd time as much as the first time I read the novel. Card's writing style allowed the reader to develop his/her own image of the setting. Personally, I loved this aspect of his writing. Overall, it is a very well written book and I personally would recommend this book to any aged reader.
1601251505|5.0|Pathfinder is an excellent system. I've seen it described as 3.75 edition so was a little skeptical at first. I originally only bought this book - I have since bought numerous Pathfinder books and will NEVER return to WotC. The Pathfinder creators have upped the par of what I expect in my supplements and I have yet to see WotC produce anything that could compete with Pathfinder.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I do not want to lose time on this product. It does not charge, it does not work and it is disgusting to clean.  A total waste of money.  I am so upset that I bought several and gave away as gifts

B002ODEJYE|5.0|Loved the DVD, the quality of merchandise was exactly on target.  The DVD was great and getting it in Blu-ray was a extra bonus.  I highly recommend it.
0061245097|5.0|I am so falling in love with this series! Jeaniene Frost has done it again, and created a wonderfully sexy and captivating sequel. The heroine has matured and Bones is still as charismatic and sexy as ever! Filled with pulse pounding action, solid endearing characters, interesting plot twists and one heck of a sex scene, this book will not dissapoint!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I watched the entire season 5 in one sitting because I just couldn't turn it off!!!  I don't know where the plot will be going  in Season 6 but I am anxious to watch it when it becomes available. I have collected all of the seasons and I would definitely recommend this season and as well as the other 4. You should only start watching it when you have a lot of time on your hands because it is going to be quite difficult not to watch all 6 discs at one time.
030746363X|5.0|Where do I start with my review of this \\"textbook\\" of personal recreation? Its a big, big book on first glance. I wouldn't have bought it had I not got it out of the library. But, once I returned it I knew I needed to purchase  a copy.<br />  Lose weight, gain weight, better sex higher sperm count all this and more ways to improve yourself. I won't go into the gory details but to say check it out. Lots of information you have never seen. Enjoy!

0439023513|4.0|I found this book to be harder to get into than the other two, but I was still happy with the ending.  The Hunger Games trilogy was definitely a great read.  While I couldn't stop reading the first two books, it took me a while to get used to the change of pace in this book.  I do, however, respect the change and like the reality of the main characters displaying signs of wear and PTSD.  As a deployed soldier, I was drawn to this story and found myself tearing up in parts of the book.  She captures the withdrawal from people that you go through when subjected to traumatic experiences that pinpointed something inside that I have never been able to articulate.  On the other hand, there were points where I question the plausibility of some of the combat scenes in the book.  Then I remind myself it's fiction, and I'm just in it for the ride. It was a haunting story that I couldn't read fast enough.

B0037A4ILC|4.0|I received my DVD yesterday (2/19/11) and watched it.  Although I was very disappointed that the movie was all spoken in German, it held my attention til the end.  I saw no mention it would be in a foreign language.  The title on the front and all other writing on the DVD were in English.  It was annoying that I had to spend the money on a movie in which I would end up having to read the whole script.  The English at the bottom of the screen went by so quickly that I barely had time to read it and even less time to WATCH it.  So buyer beware...or maybe I missed something....
B0009WFF7M|1.0|Here's the deal:  I own the first 1985 pressing of the DDD-recorded \\"Brothers In Arms\\".  Awesome musical performances!  As one of the first \\"rock CD's\\" ever released, I used it through the 80's as a demonstration disc because of the chest-thumping drums and dynamic range it possessed...until now.  WB Records has absolutely RUINED the stereo mix on what possibly might have been a BETTER sounding 20th anniversary release, if that's even possible.  The drums now possess NO punch whatsoever in an effort to compete in \\"the loudness wars\\".  I compared \\"MFN\\" with the short version from their greatest hits CD released a few years ago, and the radio edit KICKS A$$ over this over-limited garbage that might as well be advertised as an mp3.  [I can't comment on the 5.1 mix as I can't bring myself to be disappointed further by more record company f**kery under the bogus marketing mask of \\"remastering\\" - aka rebastarding.  I just hope the 5.1 mix wasn't ruined like the stereo was.]  Keep your better sounding vinyl version and the early copies of this if you can truly appreciate dynamic range over this \\"hammered dog $h!+\\".  I should have played this promptly and made Amazon take it back, but never dreamed the stereo mix would suck so much.  That's the only way we can stop the record companies from pawning off these \\"rebastard\\" recordings!
B000022TSV|3.0|I've seen Carmen a few times, and this one had a less visually colorful scheme going for it, but a unique angle on the story all the same.  I remember a line from \\"Moulin Rogue\\", where one of the dancers tells the young aspiring writer, \\"Never fall for a woman who sells herself for a living.  It always ends badly!\\"  So it is with this French tail of a Gendarme falling for one of the local independent women.      Truth is I remember the opera, but I don't remember much of this production because after I rented it and popped it in my old VHS player, I fell asleep.  It was that boring.  Carmen, like other operas given a cinematic sheen, isn't known for a lot of flashy and stylistic gloss, and so it is that this production is pretty plain in the beginning.  Hence the reason I fell asleep.    If you must see a version of Carmen on your TV screen, then take a chance on one of the more colorful stage production caught on video.  This one misses a few marks.
B0000AUHPK|2.0|I love \\"Wuthering Heights\\" as a book and I enjoy comparing adaptations. What is it about this psychologically dark book written by a brilliant but ill-fated young mid-19th century parson's daughter that compels so many to read, watch and continually adapt it into films, or even write songs about it?  Is it just the need to try to capture the essence of this fascinating yet somewhat repellent story about revenge, twisted love, greed and hatred?  Or is a desire to top other productions, some kind of contest to come out the winner of the best interpretation of Emily Bronte's colossal (as described by her sister Charlotte) masterpiece?  After coming across the 1992 Peter Kosminsky film these questions came to mind even more so than before. Promoted on the back of the DVD cover as the only theatrical movie version to cover the novel's entirety (if only skimming the surface, as completely would be impossible), for me this interpretation of the Bronte novel fell short in many areas and had a less than authentic feel.  While the house representing the Heights is obviously fake and constructed specifically for the film, the locations, as appealing to the eyes as they were, did not seem to fit the description in the novel.  Along with the usual grumbles (the actors being too old, the timeline for when situations occured in the book), Ralph Fiennes, while undeniably a formidable presence in film, was miscast as Heathcliff - singled out by some as being too \\"refined\\" for the role, he comes across as being brutal but lacking the rough and uncouthness of Bronte's anti-hero - especially in the early sequences.  Juliette Binoche, as lovely and competant an actress as she is, was undone not only by her French accent, but the fact that she was saddled with playing two complex and difficult roles - that of the elder Catherine (Cathy) Earnshaw Linton, and her daughter, Catherine Linton Heathcliff Earnshaw - undermines the movie even more.  Was it done for budget reasons? The blonde wig she wears as the daughter is an irritating distraction, not to mention that the younger Catherine is not supposed to resemble her mother.<br /><br />Jonathan Firth as the sickly, annoying Linton Earnshaw is pretty much stuck with a thankless role as Heathcliff's effete son with the silly, and ultimately equally ill-fated Isabella (played by Sophie Ward). Edgar Linton (Simon Shepard) is even more weak and pitiable than in the book or any other film adaptation I've seen. But he still seems rather colorless (pardon the expression) and seems to be trying his mightiest to stay awake during the proceedings.<br /><br />Jeremy Northam as Hindley isn't seen nearly enough (add me to those who feel he should have played Heathcliff instead). Northam, Janet McTeer (as faithful servant Ellen \\"Nelly\\" Dean) and to a lesser extent, Jason Riddington as Hareton were the saving grace of this film for me.  I don't know if the rest of the cast tried too hard or if the director did (or perhaps a bit of both?), but for me their efforts, while admirable, can't elevate the project to what they were trying to achieve. It does seem that Fiennes himself has less than kind words for this production - an unpleasant experience, one that almost turned him off of working on films.<br /><br />To look at, the movie is pleasant enough. There is a feeling of a tight budget regarding costuming, hair (wigs) and interiors, but the absence of staginess that often prevailed in many of the earlier BBC televison productions is a plus, as is the music score and the interesting casting of Sinead O'Connor as Emily Bronte herself, taking over as narrator which in the novel was put to Lockwood and Nelly.<br /><br />I do feel that this interpretation of WH is overrated, and while it covers more of the book than the classic 1939 Olivier/Oberon picture and the 1970 Dalton/Calder-Marshall production, both of those earlier renditions (speaking for myself) were far more enjoyable and better paced.  If you want to see abetter depiction of WH (especially the second generation comprised of younger Catherine, Hareton and Linton), check out the 1998 and 2009 Masterpiece Theatre presentations. (I'd recommend the BBC 1978 miniseries if I had seen it but it's unavailability on region 1 DVD makes it difficult). While both of those made-for-TV projects take liberties, for me they captured the book better in many respects.ially the second generation comprised of younger Catherine, Hareton and Linton), check out the 1998 and 2009 Masterpiece Theatre presentations.

B001ASVXSE|5.0|My only hesitation in purchsing this box set was concern about the sound quality.  I did a Google search and found this link to EMI in the UK, which not only lists all the works but shows which ones have been digitally remastered:  [...] So purchase this set by the greatest violinist of the 20th century with peace of mind; I did.

B00448SE4S|1.0|I don't drink or take drugs, but that might be the only way to appreciate this movie.  Sanity called and wants my TV back.  I am very frightful of the future due to the positive reviews this movie has received.  If I feel dumber for having watched this thing, what about those who don't even realize they are dumber from having watched it.  I will admit that it wasn't the dumbest as there was a few entertaining points to it, but overall I was stunned at the presumably acid induced idiocy.
B004DWKO8Y|5.0|It's hard to deny that the lineup of Mr. Big is exceptionally talented. These musicians are tremendous, and when you get an album which the songwriting is also top-notch, then you're in for a real treat. Mr. Big, whose last proper studio album was all the way back in 2001 (Actual Size), picks right up where it left off and then some. Nearly every song is excellent, but the tracks \\"All The Way Up,\\" \\"I Get the Feeling\\" and \\"Undertow\\" really stuck in my head after the first listen.<br /><br />From start to finish, this is one of Mr. Big's harder rocking efforts. They have never released a poor album (they are about as reliable a band as you can find) but this one simply rocks more than, say, 1996's \\"Hey Man.\\" And on top of that, the vocals and production are spot on, making the band sound as good as they did in their prime. With this album, the band has given themselves new life, as these new songs will sound great during their live shows. In a different era, this album would have burned up the charts, but that's okay. It's the ultimate reward for loyal fans of the group who have waited so long for this album; an album so good that only their most loyal fans would have thought this band still had left in them. These songs are so immediate and powerful that it sounds as if Mr. Big could continue making good albums into the NEXT decade. Bottom line, if you want to support a band who takes pride in great musicianship, well-written songs, and passionate performances, go and buy this CD.

Jodi Picoult has a way of engaging the reader and making us feel like we are in this story.  It is a very heartfelt story.  I read it before watching the movie, and I HATED the movie.  The novel is SO much better ! I definitely recommend.

It is written in the voice of a child and it took a few pages for me to get used to that, but after a awhile you do not even notice. The author did a really good job blending the way a child speaks and what an adult would understand. This may be one of my new favorite books!
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|This is a great movie if you enjoy movies that are relaxed, funny, and provide a plot that doesn't take you for a roller-coaster. Films like Elizabethtown or Benny and Joon. It's hilarious and I found myself laughing out loud on several scenes. It's predictable, yet interesting and not slow like some films. I highly recommend it and will definitely watch it again. And the soundtrack is incredible.

0393338827|5.0|I found this to be a fun and informative read.  Lewis provides a picture of what happened to cause the financial meltdown by telling engaging stories of those who saw the meltdown coming.  I found myself thinking multiple times \\"Wow - that's amazing\\" as he describes what amounts to a combination of incredible incompetence, ignorance and hubris on the part of some of the employees and leaders of several major financial institutions.  Equally amazing are the stories of those who had the foresight to see what was coming and profited tremendously as a result.
B004NSULHM|2.0|Let me preface this unfortunate review with my undying love and devotion to Radiohead as my favorite band ever.      I'm not going to go so far as call this album \\"bad\\" or \\"good\\" because lets face it, music speaks to everyone differently.  What I will say, however, is that I am pretty disappointed with this album and I would probably rank it in quality around the same level as Pablo Honey-a very mixed rated album which I am sure this album will receive much of the same.      What really sets this album apart from the others is its lack of energy.  The first track \\"Bloom\\" does try to bring a bit of hype like \\"15-step\\" does in \\"In Rainbows,\\" however after the first four tracks it really begins to fade away.      If I had to categorize this album, I would put it in easy listening.      That is not to say that it is a complete loss by any means.  \\"Bloom\\" is a bit overly scattered sound wise, however it is pretty catchy.  \\"Codex\\" is quite slow and quiet but its pretty addictive as well.  Last, \\"Separator\\" is probably the one song that will stick in your head more than others and to be honest, it really spoke to me.      I'm not really sure what they were trying to do with \\"Give up the ghost,\\" but you will either love it or hate it.  The birds chirping and guitar sound almost makes it sound a bit like country which leads me to believe that this whole album was a big experiment.      In the end, its nothing personal against Radiohead.  I love you guys to death, but I know what I like and what I don't like and after the awesomeness of \\"In Rainbows,\\" this cannot even compare.

0061726826|5.0|Delirium is the first book I have read by Lauren Oliver. I still have yet to read Before I fall, but trust me when I say, It WILL be the next book I buy! I had Delirium on hold for a library e-copy. I am beyond happy that I went ahead and purchased this MAGNIFICENT novel!<br /><br />For me, Delirium is one of those books that makes me want to shout about it from the rooftops! It is beautifully written in a way that is just completely captivating. I was so enamored with this book that it was very hard to put down. I found myself caught up in the emotion that the characters were feeling. I would catch myself actually holding my breath, without even realizing it! Oliver's writing is descriptive in a way that it made me feel like I was actually in Portland, Maine watching the scenes unfold right there in front of me. While reading what Lena was going through, I felt the passion, the sadness, the hatred and the joy with her. It was an absolutely amazing experience.<br /><br />Lena lives in a world where the government has proclaimed that Love, otherwise known as amor deliria nervosa, is a disease that is \\"the deadliest of all deadly things.\\" Lena's eighteenth birthday is approaching and then she will be old enough to have the procedure. The procedure that cures the disease. She will no longer be at risk of catching this horrible disease that causes so much pain and sorrow. She doesn't want to end up like her mother, who committed suicide when Lena was young because she was infected with amor deliria nervosa.<br /><br />Not long before her procedure is scheduled to take place, Lena's whole world gets turned upside-down when she meets Alex. She begins to doubt everything she has been taught. She goes from anticipating the \\"cure\\" to utterly dreading it. No longer so intent on doing everything that she is told to do.<br /><br />The characters in this story were great. Lena, who started out the average face in the crowd, growing into someone she never thought she would be. Its such a remarkable transformation to 'see'. Hana, Lena's best friend, was equally as pleasing. The tall, beautiful, rich blonde who everyone stops and stares at. What I love about Hana is that even though she has all these things she could boast about, she is in no way snobby or thinks of herself as better that Lena. Alex, I really don't know how to put this beast of a man into words, but if you're interested in finding out about him, Lauren Oliver does it best!<br /><br />I cannot forget to mention the romance aspect of this novel. This is one hell of a love story! I'm not kidding guys, I was not expecting to fall in love with this story as much as I did! Sometimes reading the romance parts in a novel bothers me. Not because I'm uncomfortable reading it, but because it can be too 'cheesy' or there is not enough romance to fully satisfy me with the story. Delirium was spot on.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver did a fabulous job! I really just cant say enough about this book. If you have considered reading it, DO IT! You wont regret it :-)sformation to 'see'.

B003O86MY8|4.0|This was a new kind of music for me. Rock Symphonies combines classic music with a lot of violin , with clasical rock. I found it a great cd to listen to when I wanted something in the background to listen to. You'll recognize lots of tracks on the album but with a new twist. I will probably buy more music from this artist.
B001NJY56M|5.0|I am bias because I am a My Chemical Romance fan and have been one for a long time.  I remember when this album was new and it is still as good today as it was then.  It is definitely a stronger album than Danger Days, but that isn't really what this review is about.  The insert to the vinyl has a lot of interesting photographs of the band from when they were starting up, and the art on the lyrics sheet is really nice.  Granted the disc isn't 180 grams, which is disappointing, the disc comes as a translucent color disc.  I was very surprised to see this considering these were printed before the band was known or had the label they have now.  This is a great buy for any emo vinyl collector.    Oh one other note, I have two turntables and AudioTechnica ATHX AD700's.  One turntable has a Shure sapphire tip and the other has an AudioTechnica osmium tip in it.  Don't invest in a new sapphire or diamond cartridge for this one, you won't notice a real difference.
1595141715|5.0|I bought this book because I heard Selena Gomez would be starring in the film verison. What I did not expect to feel for the characters in the book. Im more of non-fiction reader, but this story really hooked me in with the dual narratives. Often, I would check how many pages I have left until the end of the chapter, but I didn't this time. The book are beautifully written, building suspense just for the sake to see how all those 13 reasons interwine to Hannah's suicide. I definetly will read it again.   One of the only few fiction books that earn five stars on my list.
B0034G4P7Q|3.0|Since I don't have access to the facts, I can't judge how accurate this movie is, but I'll assume that the broader outlines of the movie are at least reasonably accurate. If so, I found Zuckerberg to be surprisingly SAT/IQ bright, arrogant, ambitious, socially inept, insensitive, and willing to betray others. I also found that more work went into creating Facebook than I would have guessed, although luck was clearly also needed for it to become such a runaway success.<br /><br />While many people are apparently fascinated by this, I didn't find this movie to be any sort of landmark, and frankly I found much of it to be boring. It's basically about a bunch of cocky kids who want to be rich (or richer), and they stumble on an idea that makes that possible, but then they fight over credit and money when they strike gold. There's nothing really new or special here, so I found neither the characters nor their stories to be particularly interesting.  I don't regret having watched the movie, but it fell well short of my expectations.
0307276902|3.0|As I was reading it, much of the book seemed far fetched, and I didn't relate to anything about the treatment he went through. When it comes down to the drug addiction aspect, on the other hand, I can relate (on some level). I understand what he means by the \\"fury\\". I normally just call it being angry. But it is something different. It feels like a hole that needs to be filled. Many things can fill the \\"hole\\" from; drugs, alcohol, food, to making love, laughing with a friend, or as he seems to use more often, pain and destruction. Just as an example, I recently sprained my ankle, and it was almost healed. I was in a very bad mood, went to the YMCA, and ran until I was in a lot of pain again, and the pain just feels so much better than the emptiness. Maybe it's not the same, but I felt like I could understand where he got the general idea from. It seems almost like he took small pieces of many peoples' stories from drug abuse, and recovery, and threw them into one book.<br /><br />I got the book for free, and I plan to keep passing it on. It maybe not be worth buying, but it was worth the time spent reading it. I would suggest buying a book based on a real story, but if you see it on a friend's bookshelf, or at a rummage for fifty cents, try it out.<br /><br />P.S. I applaud Oprah for picking a book on addiction/recovery for her book of the month. I wouldn't expect her, or anyone else on her staff to know how wacky it sounded. It's a shame the author is a butt.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|(The title is my favorite line in the movie, spoken by Timothy Mouse to Dumbo.)<br /><br />I rented \\"Dumbo\\" so that I could preview it before buying it for my 5-year-old, who saw a preview for it on another Disney DVD and wants to see it.  This animated movie about a sweet-faced, sad-eyed baby elephant got a strong emotional reaction from me.....and I tend to have a somewhat jaded view of the world.<br /><br />Regarding the quality of the movie itself:  I thought the movie was visually pretty; not as gorgeous as, say, \\"The Lion King,\\" but since this movie is 70 years old, that's to be expected.  The story flowed well, though I wish the ending had been a bit more complete as it felt rushed to me.  The songs were memorable, especially \\"Baby Mine.\\" (I don't see how anyone can watch that scene and not get a lump in their throat, at the very least.)<br /><br />Many people have commented on two scenes in the movie that many consider to be controversial.  I agree that the \\"roustabout\\" number has some cringe-inducing lyrics.  It was a reflection of the times, and that ugly aspect of history can't be hidden from the art of that time period.  Regarding the highly discussed \\"pink elephants\\" number:  I think it was merely a diversion meant to lighten up the mood of the movie since that number takes place after a couple of very sad scenes, plus it led Timothy Mouse to determine that Dumbo can fly.<br /><br />Parents should know that this story is a variation of \\"The Ugly Duckling,\\" and some children, particularly those who are very sensitive to the feelings of others, may be disturbed by Dumbo's treatment.  That aspect of the movie is what got to me.  The artists clearly convey the love that Dumbo and his mother have for each other, as well as the sadness they feel over the events that transpire.  Dumbo triumphs in the end, but as I wrote earlier, the ending is very quick, and in my opinion, doesn't really allow the audience to share in his glory. Instead, the ending just assures us that he is going to be okay, then the credits roll.<br /><br />My final decision on whether or not to buy this movie for my child is that while I do want her to watch it, I plan to wait a year or two. Dumbo is a wonderful movie, and there are many topics to be discussed after watching it, important topics that should be discussed in families.  I just want to be sure that she has the emotional maturity to express what she's feeling and discuss it with me. If I were to give an age range that I think would be appropriate for this movie, I'd say age 7 and up.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|The last of the true works of Nerf art to grace the plastic production lines. Sleek, comforting, and manual fire control. None of this battery powered malarkey! All honest spring and plunger action here.    Graceful. Delicate. Subtle. Effective. Nondeadly too, so the legal implication of sniping the Associate Dean of Law from the roof overhang of the Commerce faculty is relatively easy to solve.
0670022411|5.0|I fell in love with this book right away and it just kept getting better. The characters were amazing and Diana Bishop is one of the best female characters I have read about in a long time! It's so easy to fall hard for Matthew and he is what a vampire is supposed to be: tall, dark, handsome, smart, charming but still frightening and lethal. They have a very believable romance and I can't wait to read more about them. For people who aren't huge romance fans, there are plenty of other plot points to keep you interested and the historical and literary references are one of my favorite parts of the book. The houses almost become characters in the book, similar to many classic gothic novels, and I wish I could live in any of them! In case anyone doesn't know by now, this is the 1st book in a planned trilogy and the ending raises more questions than it answers.
B00284BNKC|5.0|This powerful movie is a unusually strange slice of life for four people that we watch as their dreams slowly deteriorate. This is a strong film that will mean different things to different individuals. I haven't been the same since viewing it. It is also not like any other film I've seen. I haven't deciphered the entire movie after a second viewing.
0307383415|4.0|I was already an Obama supporter when I read the bio. I learned a lot about our President that impressed me and increased my support of him. I used some of it to contradict those people I talked to who believed false information about him-like the lie that he was born in Kenya instead of Hawaii. I believe he has his father's brilliance combined with his mother's idealism and that this is helping him to be the leader we need. I highly recommend the book to anyone who wants to learn more about President Obama.
B002ZG980U|2.0|Once you've grasped the main idea the film offers few surprises.  The snow sequence is very badly organised, leaving the viewer with little idea of relative positioning of characters during action sequences (as if you even care by this stage).  The ending is so predictable as to be insulting.  Overrated and dull.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|One of the existing issues I have with the 7D is the weakness in structural integrity of the body at the CF door on the right side (the 5D has the same issue).  I shoot mostly with the 24-70 f2.8L, and the weight of that lens puts a lot of pressure in the grip area of the CF door. Consequently, the CF door flexes and creaks all the time as well at the thin bottom right edge of the body itself by the battery door.  In one year's time I have actually worn the texture off the plastic on the bottom right corner of the body due to the way the camera weight is focused into the palm of my right hand. With the BG-E7 battery grip, however, much of that pressure is redirected to the grip itself and I hear and feel less plastic flexing of 7D body parts.  The balance and control of the camera, again more so with heavy lenses, is greatly enhanced with the grip.  Construction and function appear so far to be top-notch.    While the option of using the AA battery tray is a welcome feature, it appears to come at a cost of the structural integrity of the grip.  I normally use a special quick-draw camera strap that attaches to the bottom of the camera.  However, with the BG-E7 battery grip, I no longer use that strap since there is no direct structural support for the tripod attachment point due to the necessity to have an open chamber for the AA battery tray: I'm concerned that the bottom of the grip could become bowed out if constantly jostled upside down with a heavy lens while using the tripod mounting point for the quick-draw strap.  Canon does provide an attachment point on the right side of the grip that is much more structurally sound.  I now use the original 7D strap connected to the camera body on the left and the battery grip on the bottom right.  This keeps the strap out of the way of my right hand for most operations.  There have been some functional concerns/issues raised about third-party grips for the 7D, so I took no chances and opted for the Canon product. I would also venture to guess that whatever structural considerations may exist on the Canon grip are likely to be worse on third-party.    So long as you anticipate the extra bulk of the grip (may create issues on some flash brackets due to the increased height of the camera) and modest weight increase, the handling improvement and ability to redirect pressure and wear from your right hand away from the weak spot of the 7D's body, this is an excellent addition for the 7D.  For those thinking about getting a silicone rubber camera skin for protection in the field, the one I have will not work with the battery grip installed due to crimping of a critical narrow connection point of the skin at the bottom right below the CF door opening.
1597801585|4.0|This book is an excellent view into a dystopic future of genetic tampering for profit. In The Windup Girl, today's frankenfood corporations have evolved into organizations that war over the food supply by engineering blights that ravage the foods produced by the other corporations. This is the world of the Calorie Wars.     The environment of this story is rich and detailed, describing a world where resource scarcity and continual threat of disease have reduced most of mankind to a subsistence level existence. It creates a fascinating juxtaposition of ultra-high tech with the eighteenth century third world squalor imposed by the collapse of the world's energy resources.     In the backdrop of Nippon genehack weevil and blister rust blight, the protagonist Anderson Lake is a spy for the American calorie companies in an independent Thailand. In this story he navigates his way through political intrigue, cut-throat organized crime interference, and employees that range from scheming and thieving to destructively incompetent. The result is a nail-biting ride through a maze of obstacles without a clear idea of who enemies and friends are.    Within all of this he still finds time for a romance with a Windup girl. The genetically engineered ingenue of this story is a fascinating combination of super powers and fatal flaws. Her continual struggle against her own limitations is an interesting study in the interaction of nature over nurture. Bacigalupi seems to set her up as a metaphor for how the calorie companies treat mankind by creating a strong relationship between her and Anderson that results in her downfall not because of his cruelty or lack of affection for her, but out of an intrinsic inability to balance her needs with his.    I would definitely recommend this book to any science fiction reader who enjoys dystopic visions of the future and the impact of man on our environment. However, I'm only giving it four stars because the richness of the environment seems toalmost completely overwhelm the plot line, leaving it hard to follow and sometimes make little sense. This provides it with a more real, gritty feeling, but somewhat detracts from its ability to grip the reader.
B003L20ICE|1.0|This is the most boring and pathetic movie I have seen in years. Like most mainstream \\"lez\\" movies the straight actresses are reluctant to touch or kiss. OF course in maintream cinema every lesbian is unhappy and maladjusted. A serial killer or just waiting for some man to turn her around. An absolute waste of money and time. I threw it in the garbage.
B003Y5H4SO|1.0|EVERYTHING HAPPEN IN THE ELEVATOR , WHEN WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN SOMETHING INTERESTING THE LIGHTS WILL TURN OFF AND THERE WAS A DEATH PERSON, I WASTED MY MONEY
B004LSO6YI|5.0|Watching Elena Undone woke up my heart.  The women in the movie were beautiful real women with and expressed with   a great extent passion.  We all get excited to watch an enjoyable lesbian flick however; every time a new film comes out, I get such a letdown.  I don't take pleasure in the lesbian films anymore I would rather do without.  Then Elena Undone appeared right before my eyes.  I fell in Love with both women.  At last  a Happy Ending for Love.  The film and music are so beautiful.  Thank you For making the BEST woman's film Ever..
B002MQYOFW|4.0|First off, I'd like to say that if you're into books that really leave you guessing, then this may not be the novel for you. The idea this book is based around is simply brilliant. Personally, I'm into books that give us a vivid idea of a twisted future, for exapmle: The Uglies Triology, Unwind, The Forest of Hands and Teeth.. ect. These kind of books always leave my mind full of questions. I would definitely add this book to that list, the only problem I had with this novel is that the author tends to drop to many hints through out the story, which made it too obvious all around for my taste. She does have a well developed idea and characters, but she never left me with a Â«Oh my, whats going to happen next?!Â» feeling. Some parts of the story did surprise me, though that was a seldom occurrence. Still, I really did enjoy this book, and I'd recommend it to someone as well. I'll certaintly go on to finish the series, With strong hopes that the following novels are a bit less predictable. Bravo Suzanne Collins, how you came up with such an interesting idea for the future, I may never comprehend!
B0049MAXQG|5.0|This movie is really good if are a fan of scary movies you will not regret to rent or own this movie.   Full of Terror, horrible voices and faces, something  you can not forget in  long time
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It is a really good and suspenseful book with a different adventure at each turn. If you like the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series you will love this book!!!
0547258305|5.0|This is much more than a love story or a simple fantasy.  It was about people who has the ability to do something more for other, and did so.  It's funny, but I was reading about Habitat for Humanity at the same time and felt that what Katsa did was similar.  This is a great read and surprisingly deep.  I do not believe the love story is similar to Twilight in anyway.  Their love are as strong but everything else is very different.  No matter what, I categorize this book as a must read.  Very impressive for a first time novel.  I couldn't put it down.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|This movie is superb.  The first time I saw it I loved it.  The second time it was even better.  It does a great job of making the viewer say, \\"Could this really happen?  What would I do in this situation?\\"  Great film!
B003EV6DBM|4.0|As always, I intend to review the product that is purchased rather than the media content. I don't intend to write a review for the series' episodes. I've purchased the DVD sets for each series since Eccleston's in 2005. Each has its own slight variations, and each has their own benefits and drawbacks. This one for Matt Smith's first (hopefully, of many) series is slightly more clumsy in terms of the packaging than others. Mainly, each disc is cradled in a clear plastic tray which fit together like pages of a book, however, unless this \\"book\\" is closed in the right fashion, the whole enclosure will fail to close, and it is awkward at best, breakable at worst.<br /><br />The cover is the old-fashioned 3D simulation where it reflects a different image when rotated to the left or right, and the plastic is ridged. This cover is glued onto the box with adhesive that you hope will stand the test of time (no pun intended). The inner \\"book\\" comes out of the box just like for the Third and Fourth Series DVD sets. The cover of the \\"book\\" shows the face of the Pandorica with the circular ridges glowing a faint green glow, as was seen in Episode 12, \\"The Pandorica Opens\\". The back cover has this same circular face but without the glow, and at the top, part of The Doctor's poetic monologue as he sat beside Amelia Pond's bed in \\"Big Bang\\": \\"We're all stories in the end...\\" (it continues)<br /><br />Consistent with all series DVD sets, this one has special glossy cards and the bonus DVD containing cut-down versions of Doctor Who Confidential. I truly wish one day we can get all of the COMPLETE episodes of DWC!<br /><br />An important note: this DVD set does not contain any of the Christmas specials or others transitioning from David Tennant to Matt Smith.
B004L3AQFG|5.0|Every year, hundreds of movies are released. Very few of these movies ever connect with me personally. 127 Hours is the first movie in a long time to make a special connection - I loved it - and while it is brilliant film-making, single people like myself are bound to take something more away from Danny Boyle's newest masterpiece.<br /><br />Aron Ralston (portrayed brilliantly by James Franco) is a real individual, and this film is the story of 127 hours of his life - the 127 hours that changed him forever (both literally and figuratively). While hiking in Utah, a rock is wedged free and falls on his arm, pinning him in a deserted cavern far away from civilization. Without cell service, limited water, and options, Ralston must decide how much he wants to live, and how far he is willing to go to leave his fateful predicament. If you haven't heard of this story in the news, I won't spoil what happens. If you have heard, don't NOT see this movie because you think it will be too disgusting. Boyle has a way of making even the most horrid of moments emotionally moving - and you can always squint.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the best movies of the year - it would be the best if not for [[ASIN:B003XKPPOU Toy Story 3 (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]]. It's not just a movie about getting stuck and the will to survive. It's a film about how important life is, even when you live alone without many friends. Ralston lived almost in a state of auto-pilot - not caring where life took him, just wanting to get through it all. I'm not there personally, but some days - many days - I have come close. I would give this film a 9 out of 10 - see it.
0553296981|4.0|The Diary of Anne Frank, was entertaining and informative. By writing to her diary,named Kitty,which she got for her 13th birthday,Anne entertained the reader (me).She entertained me  by writing about some of the humorous events that went on while Anne and her family  were hiding in the \\"Secret Annexe\\" with two other families. It informed the reader (me) about the German police,attacks on Holland and what the families did while they were in hiding.Such as reading,writing,eating and arguing. The main conflict was the threat of being found. It was solved by,well,being found. I guess you'll have to read it to find out the rest!
B000002JEV|5.0|I am extremely glad that I decided to buy Led Zeppelin's BBC Sessions. I like them better than the studio versions and I have almost every one of their albums. Well worth the money to get the full album.
B0017T4IG0|5.0|This movie has always been a favorite, one of the first to give computers emotions.  Great songs and music. Luv it. Now I just wish I could get in on DVD.
B0007Y89ZM|3.0|I have both DVDs and I disagree with those that say HFO is better I thought it had too many slow songs.  Farewell has 3 hours of music and is very well done. No contest!  The Eagles are the best why not get more concert for the money.
B0049JPU8A|5.0|Lyrically polished, musically spectacular, and melodically entrancing, \\"Science & Faith\\" takes the promise of the first half of The Script's first album and blows it out into a fully realized musical accomplishment of the first order. Songs endure repeated listenings -- I've played the album probably 75 times since I bought it, and I'm still craving more. Great vocals, wonderful songs, terrific lyrics, and a blend of material -- I wish more artists could make ALBUMS these days, especially albums as satisfying as this. An instant classic!
0385341679|5.0|I've been dying for this book to be published but then it took me a good 2 weeks to get through the first 15% of the book which I was reading on my Kindle. The beginning just dragged. I picked up the book tonight expecting to read 'a few more pages...' and then BOOM I just couldn't put it down!!!! I'm still in shock! I just spent 7 hours reading straight to finish the book instead of doing EVERYTHING ELSE I was supposed to do tonight. What an incredible ending!!!! I had no idea how Karen Moning was going to manage to tie up all the loose ends. It seemed like an impossible series to have a real ending too. But she managed!!!! All I can say is WOW!!!!
B003ITZBW2|5.0|Absolutely wonderful.  Dark, moody and just really grabs you.  This is probably my favorite DC Animated movie ever.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|For some reason, this movie has really stayed with me.  It's partly the music,a good bit of the actors and script and a great deal of empathy watching the career end for a very admired and likeable but now, ill Kelly.  Well now, I guess I just answered my own question!  hutch1947
B002VKE1K2|1.0|The movie might have been interesting as the imaginings of an emotionally disturbed girl.    What we get is a film in which nothing happens over and over again.

B00433SVP6|5.0|this book was really interesting and compelling!! it drew me in from the beginning. i am obsessed with greek myths they are so amazing! i liked the new characters especially piper(shes so smart and pretty!) but leo annoyed me a lot sometimes! of course i did miss percy but i enjoyed the twist with him and jason!! i wont say it cos ill ruin it. this book is the sort of book you can read again and again and each time is as good as the last! the only thing i am annoyed at is the second books not coming out till autumn!!!! why does he torture us??? well anyway this book was brilliant and anyone who doesnt like it is just crazy(no offence just my opinion!)
B0002KZAKS|5.0|Bought three mics to cover front of stage for a show I did with seniors who did not project well. I looked up on Wiki the sort of mike I needed and then searched Amazon and found these. Was surprised at how cheap they were and delighted at their performance. The show was a great success as all the actors were heard by their friend (also seniors).

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I simply loved it. I quickly read the next 2 in the series and loved them as well.  I also read the first in the pre-quel series and loved it equally.  I can't wait for the rest of the books to come out.  The film rights have been sold and I just hope if a movie is made it does the series justice.
6301763041|5.0|Movie is a classic.  Not sure I would recommend for children under 13/14, but I grew up on it and love its cheesiness!  Of course, Johnny Depp is great!
B000PY52EU|4.0|This  is  a movie   with   steamy  romance  friendship    and  an  excellent  cast.
B0000667ER|2.0|I read reviews about this book before I purchased it and many warned buyers that they should buy the book new, as there is a one-use password to take the test online.  Once the password has been used once, it cannot be reused.  I made sure I purchased the book new.  It looked new when I received it.  Yet, when I went online to take the test and I entered the passcode I found inside the flap of my book, the system said that the password had already been used.  So, someone had already accessed that particular password.  I gave the review 2 stars because I still got a bit of useful information from the book, but without having my personal results for the online test, most of the book was of little use to me.
B003XU75QG|5.0|Taylor Momsen in The Pretty Reckless is most exciting and talented girl fronted rock band to come on the music scene in decades! This under age goody-goody Gossip Girl TV show actress, now gone bad girl has one of the most beautiful sexy and energy charged voices ever heard, back by an incredible band with some very edgy and and well written songs that are guaranteed to be top hits in the coming months if they can get past the radio station sensors.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Due to his stammer, Prince Albert (Colin Firth) has always been content to stand in the background of the British monarchy, conducting the occasional painfully awkward public speaking engagement as needed.  However, the death of his father (Micheal Gambon), Hitler's aggression in Europe, his brother's (Guy Pearce) affair with a divorcee (Eve Best), and the powerful new technology of radio conspire to focus the attention of the world on his ability to inspire confidence in his listeners.  An eccentric speech therapist (Geoffery Rush) appears to be his only hope.    Director Tom Hooper and screenwriter David Seidler have fashioned a compelling drama that highlights the human element in a great moment in world history.  Their success is underscored by the fact that this film's riveting climax involves nothing more than two men in a room with a microphone--but of course it is really about so much more than that.  The magnificent cast is invaluable.  Helena Bonham Carter, who has been playing more than her fair share of crazy fantasy characters lately, shows she can still act with subtlety.  Timothy Spall, whom I always see playing cretinous filthy toadies, projects gravitas as Winston Churchill.
0307454541|5.0|I love all of these books.  This one i particular holds a special place.  It is so well written i never wanted it to end.  I wish there were more.
B002ZG980U|5.0|The movie is about a man named Cobb who enters peoples dreams and extracts secrets from their subconcious. He's hired to do a job called \\"Inception\\", implanting an idea in their minds (for a certain outcome) rather than just stealing secrets, to do this job he gets some other helpers who each play an important role in the operation. When they enter the target's mind things don't go as planned and they have to figure out how to get out before they go into limbo.<br /><br />The plot is pretty deep and there's many facets to it so I think you should see it rather than me trying to explain it all in full detail.<br /><br />Considering what I heard from other people, I had high expectations. I also just also watched another \\"Award Winning Movie\\" and was not impressed. This movie basically lived up to the expectations. It made you think, had concepts you don't usually see in movies and had good acting. I wish there were more movies like this instead of watching the same old thing over and over.<br /><br />I really don't care for extremely confusing movies but it was confusing in a good way. Some argue the concepts been done before but it hasnt been done before in this way or this well.<br /><br />Is it the best movie in the world? Id say it's not the best but in the top 5. If it has things i've never seen before in a movie and a good story then yea i'd say its near the best ever.<br /><br />People try to compare this to other movies from the past that shared a similar concept- but you can't. This is way better and more realistic than others that have come out in the past.<br /><br />It's better than Memento and 95 percent of all the movies ever made. It's not perfect but it's close. Contains some special features. Highly Recommended.
B001P3SA94|2.0|I will say up front- I am a huge Chess Records fan. I don't think you can like anything even approaching rock music without loving at least SOMETHING that label put out. I think labels like Chess and Stax did as much to change people's attitudes about race as MLK or the sit-in movement. So it is in my mind criminal to not only tell this story without the panache it deserved, but it also misused two fantastic actors- Adrien Brody and Jeffrey Wright, whom I have loved and wanted to see more of since \\"Basquiat\\".     How could it go wrong? By taking the same well-worn paths as every other movie set in a time period that necessitates a careful attention to production. Period films in my mind often fail (me anyway) because of the picturesque yet somehow lifeless sets. I know that most people may not pay attention to these things, but it always bugs me when its done wrong. I couldn't help but think of the film \\"Far From Heaven\\" with its super-saturated colors and period angles, and how those types of techniques would have been perfect for a film like this. Those pink cadillacs, those candy-colored dresses- a sense of a color and a sense of place would have rescued this from the VH-production values that stultify the story.     And what a story it could have been. Muddy Waters ascent from sharecropper to music legend is a drama in and of itself. Why did it not move? Why were the characters seemingly so two-dimensional? Why did one not get a sense at all of the hardships that Muddy faced, and the dramatic difference in his lifestyle after his success? Why were the filmmakers so easily satisfied with showing a few muddy fields and a couple dirt roads? Why was the second Chess brother left out? Why did one not get a sense of the Chess brothers as people? And why the horrible, typical slide guitar incidental music that's used in every drama set in the south, no matter how far from the Delta it may be?     I hope at some point that someone else makes this story walk. Its a storythat should be told. Chess Records and its legacy should make the pulse race- not fill one's nostrils with the smell of Hollywood. Maybe Beyonce's fee used up all the budget that could have gone into the production design and a better story. If you like Chess then you will see this, but you won't be moved if you are anything like me.

B001VLXNLU|3.0|I was not overly thrilled with this book. The whole time I was reading it, I was thinking, this feels like Harry Potter... suddenly powered, sent off to a school, and the adventures... I was not impressed. Most vampire novels I read keep my attention better than this one did. It took me a week to read this. I won't read anymore of the novels, as I just feel that it will be more adventures of Harry (in this case - Zoey) and his (her) pals.<br /><br />As far as the writer, I think that they are good at what they do, just need to find something of a better storyline.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|Brendan Fraser is a superb actor, as is Dave Foley whose expressive face and innuendo are priceless.  The woman (?) less so.  The parents were great, both veteran actors who supported the main character flawlessly.  What I really loved was the naievete of the main character.    I loved the movie, what little I did get to see.  It kept freezing, pixellating and stopping altogether at odd moments so I was unable to sit and watch it from beginning to end in one sitting.
067144901X|5.0|I must admit, if I was rating this book on my opinion alone, I'd probably give it three stars, but when I review childrens books I rate them on whether or not they hold my granddaughter's interest. My two and four year old granddaughters love these books. This is one of their favorite. We all have it memorized. Probably a good five star toddler book is one that you read over and over and over....
B0001KL5DA|5.0|I now have the 5 seasons of Six Feet Under. I ordered the second season off of Amazon because it was the only one I had not found in stores. To my surprise the movies cost less from Amazon with shipping and handling included then in the stores. I now go to Amazon when I am looking for movies or books hoping to be able to get them. Hoping in the near future I can get what I need from here, because I am Canadian I am not able to order some articles cause they will not ship them out of United States. But I still try to order them if I can.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|Dan (Kevin Zegers), Lynch (Shawn Ashmore), and Parker (Emma Bell) are spending a relaxing weekend at a local ski resort.  Itching to get off of the \\"bunny hill\\" and try some \\"real\\" skiing, the trio decides to bribe the lift operator into letting them take one last run before the slopes close for the week.  The operator quickly pockets the $100 offered by Emma, and they are soon on their way up to the top of the main hill.  However, on their journey up, the lights shut down, the chair lift stops moving, and the resort shuts down until the following weekend.  Suspended 60 feet above the ground, there is no way to get down.    Left totally alone and with the prospect of severe weather moving in, the group struggles with what they should do.   Frostbite is beginning to take its toll, and the onset of hypothermia has begun.  An approaching maintenance vehicle leads to the prospect of rescue, and Dan, Parker, and Lynch begin throwing their gear at the vehicle, hoping to attract the driver's attention. Unfortunately, it's all for naught, as the vehicle drives away, leaving the three still trapped on the lift.  Dan decides to jump down and go for help, but he breaks his legs and is left immobilized.  To make matters even worse, a pack of hungry wolves has moved in.    Down to two, Lynch decides that the best option would be for him to try to proceed, hand over hand, suspended from the bottom of the lift cable to the nearest lift tower and climb down the ladder to the ground.  After much exertion, Lynch makes it, but once again, the wolves are waiting.  Left alone and hanging from a now-broken lift seat, Parker jumps herself and manages to evade the wolves, but will she make it to safety, or will the wolves catch up to her in the end?    At first, I was expecting \\"Frozen\\" to be more on the lines of a traditional horror film, but after I got into it, I realized that it involved more psychological terror rather than blood and guts, and I liked it.  It was frightening watchingDan, Lynch, and Parker ride up the lift and then see all of the lights go out and the chair finally stop.  I've ridden on a chair lift before, and I would be really scared if it stopped moving and didn't start again.  Granted, the scenes with the wolves are rather bloody, but I enjoyed the psychological aspect very much.    I liked this movie.  I thought the story concept was interesting, and the acting is very good.  The scenes immediately after the lift stops are truly frightening, too.  If you're a fan of psychological terror, then be sure to watch \\"Frozen\\"; it's really scary.

B003Q6D27S|5.0|this movie is goretastic i am very happy that i have this movie,  the end was great loved how it ended that dude got what he deserved   best of all jigsaw is in the final saw i had hoped they would make up to 10   but that is not be if i was to give it a score out of 10 it would be 10 just for the blood and gore alone  well done to the creaters of this movie bravo.
B003Y5H51K|1.0|This movie is awful I couldn't wait for it to end. It was boring and it was basically a Nicholas Sparks cave movie as the movie adds the sap more and more. I predicted the ending during the first scene. Spoiler Alert: People continue to die in more outrageous and stupid ways and nobody seems to really care. I laughed throughout the death scenes and was worried I would be kicked out which probably would have been the best thing that could of happened. The main character's son is really hot but even that couldn't save this terrible move!
0765326353|4.0|Brandon Sanderson, if you have read the \\"Mistborn Trilogy\\", then get ready for an adventure. The Way of Kings is very good. I purchased this book, because I was at the end of \\"The Wheel of Time\\" saga to which Mr Sanderson is completing for the late Robert Jordan. I liked \\"The Mistborn Trilogy\\", and wanting to stay with the same author, I ordered \\"The Way of Kings\\". The one thousand pages was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. It kept me up late, I could not put it down. I thought it would take me about ten days to finish, but it took me only four days to finish.Now I have to wait a year for the next book in the series.

1401324029|2.0|Naked Heat is the second work generated by the popular TV show Castle.  Generated is the right word, Naked Heat was clearly not written by the shows protagonist, nor by anyone affiliated with the shows writing team, nor by anyone who has ever watched the show.  It has the texture of a work written against a series 'bible' by someone whose only previous commercial writing experience is scenarios for pornies.  If you do want to read this work, check it out at the local library; save your money to purchase a book that is really worth re-reading.
B000JML7EC|4.0|There have already been enough critical reviews on this book, so I'll just vote with my 4 stars and say that I enjoyed this book very much.

The A friend showed me Pathfinder and I love it. It's a role-players version of D&D with some class rewrites and changes to some systems but if you played D&D 3rd edition or 3.5 you will find it easy to adapt to and very smooth to run or play.
B00005JMAH|5.0|This is the best of all the multi-disk sets. If you only get one 2-disk set, this is the one to get. The second disk is packed with lots of interesting things such as interviews with all the main actors, games, interactive sets, and explanations of how some of the movie was made, such topics as the animals that appear in the movie,  special effects and animatronics. They show how Professor Lupin turns into a werewolf. You also get to see that all of the people involved really enjoyed making the movie. For some of the other HP movies, I found the second disk to be very boring but this one increased my enjoyment of the movie and gave me a lot of specific info that I had wanted to know.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|It is crazy to pay this price for an ebook that can't be shared.  I'll be getting my copy from the library.
B003CR9BYE|5.0|I saw Sinatra and Jobim on PBS a while back, doing several of the songs in this album and loved it. The funny thing was, previous to that show I would have bet Frank would never go near Brazilian music - as has been said here - just not his style. Wow! Was I wrong. He slipped into Bossa Nova like it was an old shoe. Sadly, I then forgot about it until I saw this DVD and ordered it immediately.    No sense in commenting on Sinatra or Jobim - they're both excellent. I've never heard Sinatra sing anything like this and, as always, he's the Chairman of the Board. Nobody does it better! I'm not much of a popular music fan, preferring classical music overall. Francis Albert Sinatra is about the only male vocalist I listen to regularly and for now this album goes to the top of my listening list.     As for any previous comments about the soundstage: for me, anyway, this is about as good a remaster as I've ever heard. I listen on a pretty good system and, while the soundstage is not particularly wide or deep, I think it was probably miked and remixed properly. I dislike those recordings where the performers are isolated in their sound booths and later the engineer locks vocals or individual instruments onto left and right speakers to get wide but artificial-sounding separation. Nuts! It sounds ridiculous. Telarc recorded orchestral works with minimal miking and gets great stereo imaging. No french horn leaping out of that left speaker or cello locked onto the right. The bottom-line is it's all about the sound and this disk sounds great!    I particularly enjoyed the liner notes. Well written and an excellent insight into the man. Frank's stopping in mid-recording and saying a goof was caused by \\"a Chesterfield, from 1948 I think\\" was great and, when the trombone player screwed up Sinatra saying, \\"No problem\\". When Sinatra received his copy of the disk and played it he called Reprise and \\"suggested\\" it be killed (he felt that three of the songs were \\"flat\\".) The writer notedthat a \\"Suggestion\\" from Sinatra was tantamount to an order. The disk was pulled.
0884271153|3.0|I have been a fan of the Goal since I worked on my MBA 10 years ago. I like to reread the Goal every 5 years or so. When I found this book online and realized it was the next book in the series I just had to buy it. It follows the same premise as the Goal. It's written in the same style as the Goal. But it leaves too many holes in the process unlike the Goal. I wanted to know more about how Alex was developing the \\"trees\\" and it gave me fluff and results not details. Still it was a very interesting read as this is a very interesting topic for me.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|I'm a huge Turtle Beach fan and have owned every generation of the Ear Force headsets since 2007. The Ear Force X41 are by far the best to date. I use them primarily for \\"Call of Duty: Black Ops\\" and the Dolby 7.1 surround sound is amazing. For example, you can \\"hear\\" where an enemy is by listening to their footsteps--behind you to the left, etc.  You can hear where everything is happening: explosions, shots... even bullet casings as they hit the ground.<br /><br />(Note: You cannot hear \\"where\\" teammates are with chat -- that would be a negative anyhow as you'd miss out on vital intel such as enemy location.)<br /><br />XBOX LIVE CHAT<br />The X41's also allow you to \\"hear\\" your own voice. Other gaming headsets I've used do not offer this feature and it may seem insignificant but it is not -- otherwise your own voice would be muffled to you and you'd tend to speak LOUDLY during the heat of battle (at least that happens to me).<br /><br />The only negative I've encountered with the X41s is in-game Xbox Live chat. The instructions suggest setting the voice volume to 10 in your Xbox Live preferences. I oftentimes join random matches and there are loud and often offensive (or at least obnoxious) players. So I like to \\"dial them down\\" so I won't hear any chat. Yes, on the wire connecting the headphones to the controller there is a switch with a \\"mute\\" (to mute your mic) and a dial to control chat volume. However, even dialing it down all the way you will still hear in-game chat.<br /><br />I set my Xbox Live chat preferences to 1 vs. the 10 suggested by Turtle Beach and it helped in terms of dialing down the in-game voice. I can still hear it but much more faintly. I'd suggest that Turtle Beach add a \\"mute\\" option for in-game chat via a button like the one it has for your own mic.<br /><br />Aside from the chat issue, the X41s deliver amazing surround sound with NO HISS (which is a first). They are comfortable on my huge adult head, are fully adjustable and have probably saved my marriage because my wife hates hearing any Xbox-related gaming (anyone feel my pain?). I recommend the X41s to anyone who wants to maximize their gaming pleasure. You only live once so make it great!s hearing any Xbox-related gaming (anyone feel my pain?).

B001E1GXPA|4.0|\\"Shogun\\" is the fourth studio album by American metal band \\"Trivium\\", originally released in 2008. The title implies a lyrical shift from the western crusades of the previous album into Asian culture and philosophy. What remains is the essence of human struggle and battling. The line up features Matt Heafy on lead vocals and guitar, Corey Beaulieu on guitar, Paolo Gregoletto on bass and Travis Smith on drums.<br /><br />The amount of effort put on the guitars is evident of first play. For that matter \\"Shogun\\" is a true testament on metal/hard rock guitar-playing as the band goes through a phenomenal amount of six-string riffs, melodies and solos on the 14 song that the limited edition of the album offers. So clearly \\"Shogun\\" is one of those albums meticulously planned to the minor detail and for that matter one has to congratulate the guys for their work.<br /><br />And above all \\"Sogun\\" is a guitar driven album, with the rhythm section following the many twists and turns of the two-guitar formation. The overall musical style follows the power-speed metal path integrating a slightly modern touch. The vocal approach blends brutal vocals with melodic singing, perhaps a trademark of contemporary heavy metal; on a personal level I do favor the clean vocals over the distorted ones on \\"Sogun\\" simply because Matt and the guys are capable of such incredible vocal melodies.<br /><br />Overall \\"Sogun\\" is so loaded with riffs, solos, melodies and rhythm patterns, becoming impossible for the listener to digest upon first play, particularly this 14-track special edition. Realistically \\"Sogun\\" is as complete a dose of heavy metal as it gets.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love, love, love this book!  I ordered on a Friday, and had finished the trilogy within a week.  It's one of those rare books that will stay in your mind, even after it's finished.
B003PGNBO8|3.0|In just over 3 days, I watched the entire series. Here are my thoughts (with spoilers).    - people's visions should have been all in first-person perspective (but, of course, we couldn't see all the actors then)    - I liked how, in the last episode, the man's flashforward from October was rescuing that woman and he was always wondering if he succeeded. All the while, the woman was wondering who was going to be killing her and what she did wrong.         Of course, her vision since the start was backwards. It showed her struggling and then sinking, but it was the other way around. Her vision was wrong. So...a flashforward itself may be remembered incorrectly.    - Some people recall how they felt emotionally at the moment in the future. I don't think we'd be 'knowing' the fear/anxiety/etc. but those feelings would be coming from just expectations of future.    - In the last episode, it was very cool to have that guy at the big party say that he had given up drinking and gave his liquour to Mark. Mark took a drink and I remember saying outloud \\"Aw no, that's too bad.\\" So, it didn't show him drinking while in the building, like in his vision, but he really did get into it at a bar earlier...nevertheless, he was pretty clear-headed and good with that shotgun. I think it would have been more interesting if he was  not as accurate at times from being as bit tipsy & even been shot at least once somewhere.    - The completely least favourite character was that of Demitri's future wife. I didn't think her acting was that good and I thought she was irritating. She always seemed fake and I didn't like her character and manner at all. It's interesting that Dimitri's character, in an extra on a DVD, stated that he thought that many people were interested in the relationship between them. For me, he was quite wrong.    - At the start of an episode, you get a quick-shot of a scene that's to be from that episode; like a little clue/flashforward. I'm pretty sure there was one episode where the shot didn't happen in that episode and had nothing to do with it; also, one was out of place from another episode.    - We never really know of what was up with that Persian woman completely. She had her own bulletin board of information that was all about event, much like Mark's. We see her later speaking to the chess-playing dude and it was all confusing. Who was she really?    - At the last episode's end, what does Charlie mean when she's looking out the window...some guy with an unrecognized voice asks what she sees...and she responds with a smile \\"They found him.\\" Is that even Charlie? You can't really know.    - I don't understand the character of 'Floss' one bit. He was an enemy of Simon but then he's in the place eating with the family and is some sort of relative? Confusing.    - Well, I never could figure out why Al Gough commited suicide. The call to him in his flashforward was from an attorney saying that Celia was take off life-support and died. The attorney said it wasn't his fault and was an accident, but Al believed he killed   her. So he ended his life so that she wouldn't die from an accident he thinks he caused? How does he know he did? He didn't see Celia in his vision. How did he know where she was to send a letter? I doubt people were really leaving full addresses at the Mosaic website. I guess we have to chalk it up to him using the FBI's resourses...but why her anyway? Why not any other person who didn't have a vision?       Al killed himself out of guilt because he thought he caused someone's death in the future and Celia was way too happy.      - They should have shown more birds falling from the sky during the second blackout. At least we got to see the kangaroo hopping around again and we'll never know what was up with him. In an extra on the DVD, one person involved with the show says she doesn't give away where or where not the kangaroo may be going, but she says that it's a symbol of how things went haywire. Another guy said that it could have just been from a zookeeper who blacked out when a cage was being shut.      We saw a loose dog, too. And I remember from other episodes during a review of the blackout, other birds were still flying. Only certain birds and not all animals are affected in a blackout...but why not all birds, at least?    - And then in the second blackout, that odd woman was wheeling Janis in the wheelchair. I forget that character's name, but she had on the ring that protected her from the blackout. Where were they going?    - Who the heck planted bombs in an FBI building and how could that even be possible?    - In one episode (the last one? I forget) That CIA guy said something like \\"Mark Benford is dead. Ran into the building. Doesn't stand a chance.\\" I noticed that the person he was saying it to gave a quick smirk, like he was glad. I think the CIA wanted to destroy the Mosaic and is somewhat behind the conspiracty.    - Notice that in the tachyon constant, GABA is mentioned. Some people with too little GABA have seizures. Remember when I spoke of the flashforwards not even being in the right order/mistakes? I predict that whatever caused the blackouts made everyone have a   prolonged seizure -- a 'drop attack' as some are identified, where you just immediately lose consciousness.     - In one of the extras on a DVD, you see Simon and Dimitri falling from the second blackout; not out of the chairs, like they are in during the last episode, but from standing (like it caught 'em by surprise).    - The people actually had a 6 month and 23 day (not including April 29) glimpse into the future.    - In the last episode, I see a March 14, 2011 and a Happy New Year 2015. So, this was a major flashforward where people saw different days.    - The last scenes have Olivia and Charlie waking up....then the exterior of the FBI building...another second...and THEN it explodes. So, was time itself frozen? There was a little over 30   seconds before a bomb was to go off andwe saw it counting down. Then the flashforward took place before it went off.         So, either time stopped when people were unconscious...or the bomb's timer was wrong and Mark was able to somehow make it out of the building before it went off after he regained consciousness.      I'll go for the time stopping. The blackout was much more powerful than the October 6 one. While others were coming to, Mark escaped before the building exploded.     - Bryce should have stayed with someone he was getting along with. By just giving up on her, he didn't even care at all -- even if as a friend -- that she was going to be drowning soon. I think that stunk and was a character flaw.    - One person does question in an episode if there could be brain damage from the blackouts. They are reasured that everything is fine...but I think the blackouts are causing such problems (as I spoke of before).    - In the \\"COULD\\" extra on the disc 2...       * you see Dimitri's girlfriend/future wife walking on the beach and the word BY is engraved in the sand in big letters; it looks so fake, too; what does BY mean and why wasn't it in any real episode showing that scene?       * there's a shot of Olivia kissing Mark in the mirror, but turning around it shows her kissing Lloyd; that was never in a real episode and was cool       * most interesting, and also not in any episode, is when Mark's got Dimitri again the wall and Mark yells \\"I should have killed you!\\"; I wonder what could have possibly led up to that happening    - A sticker on the DVD box states over 100 minutes of extras; the longest extra would have been the only audio-commentary track on the two-part \\"Revelation\\" episode and the rest were rather short, totalling I'd say 20 minutes altogether.      Oh....and I just read that disc 5 menu also has an Easter Egg that yields the nine-part 'Stories from the Mosaic', the documentary-series-within-the-series about individuals' experiences with the blackout. So that should take a bunchof time. I hate 'Easter Eggs'.  Nothing should be hidden on a discs.    - In the lone commentary with the actor who plays Simon and a female (producer?)...       * the actor who plays Simon talks about the Bible a bit and that he specifically doubts the reality of the story of Jonah and the whale; I know that in the Bible, it is only stated that a 'big fish' swallowed Jonah and it wasn't a whale necessarilly; there are reports of people being swallowed and being rescued from such an animal; and, though we don't know, it is possible that Jonah died in the animal and, just like Jesus, was alive on the third day    - I don't understand fully how Mark made the connection of the timing of the next flashfoward.    - I don't buy Olivia and Mark's breakup; he didn't start drinking...she didn't cheat...they had a kid and should have trusted each other more. They must have already had problems of some kind. She didn't even fight to stay with mark, really. I was disappointed in her behaviour and think she was a terrible as a wife.    - It's good that, even though the blackout happened again, there seemed to be less chaos. Well, at least, I would say, in the town. To think that the message of it coming again could have gotten everywhere in the world so quickly is pretty-much unbelievable.    Well, all in all, there were too many mysterious things and the ending should have showed specifically what each character's flashforward was. An awesome season finale; a terrible series finale, with so many questions unanswered. The producers promised us they would solve the issues brought up by the flashforward by the end of season one and this didn't fully happen. That had nothing to do with whether the show was renewed or not. If they wanted to create a 2nd flashforward and more issues for next season, that's fine, but they promised a wrap-up by the end of season one and they failed to do as such.    We don't know who caused the blackouts and we don't know why or even how exactly. Where were Zoey and Gabriel? What's the deal with Lita?    Charlie's vision was too-cryptic. And was it REALLY Charlie? Just because you see her eyes open after the girl says \\"they found him\\" doesn't mean it really is so. The man who says something to her wasn't Mark or Lloyd.    Where was Janis being taken?    Will Demetri get back with his almost-wife? Or will he want to help raise his kid with traitor Janis? We see a glimpse of a black baby in the second flashforward. Is that Zoey's and Dimitri's? Or Dimitri's and Janis's?    When and where DID Wedeck finally take his bowel movement???
0553381687|5.0|Little Miss Judgemental here assumed reading this fantasy tale would be the literary equivalent of Medieval Times: populist Vegas-style fake history washed down with Diet Coke and garlic bread. Boy, was I ever wrong. It's been a while since I've read a book that I looked forward to reading all day long, every day, but 'A Game of Thrones' is that book.<br /><br />Keep in mind: I'm not really a fantasy reader. I picked this book up because of the upcoming show on HBO and ended up caring so much about the characters that now I'm concerned the adaptation isn't going to do them justice! I know many have reviewed this in glowing terms, so I'll just be one of the voice-pieces for those like me who wouldn't ordinarily gravitate towards a series like this: give it a chance, people. I was utterly surprised at the slow-burning politicking, the complicated interpersonal relationships and the overall elegantly-written prose which elevated the story into true literary fantasy. A real modern classic and I can't wait to read more!
0525423273|5.0|What a sweet little breath of fresh air this was! No paranormal activity, no curses, no slaying to be done (not that I don't love that stuff.) Just a lovely tale of romance in the most romantic city in the world. Man, I am dying to go to Paris now =) Anna, for me at least, was such a true to life teen. I was one once (yes, I can remember that far back) and I happen to own one (she would KILL me for saying that lol) so I have a pretty good idea what they are like, and this book gets it right. It actually brought back memories of my first crushes and that whole questioning phase...does he like me? Did he mean to brush his hand against mine? WILL HE EVER KISS ME???<br /><br />The pacing of the book was spot on. Anna and Etienne get to know each other and they are friends so you believe in the emotion. Love that. Vital part of romance that a lot of authors seem to forget in favor of getting to the so-called good parts if you know what I mean. I like the build-up and anticipation. It makes you more invested in the characters and caring whether or not they end up together.<br /><br />There were some great laugh out loud moments. I am convinced Anna's father was Nicholas Sparks...did you feel that way too lol?? Oh, and there was a great scene where Anna said something that could be SO misinterpreted and was inwardly horrified. We've all done that, no? Said something innocently that ends up sounding so wrong! I must also commend the character for her love of Nutella. The girl has got taste =)<br /><br />Besides the charming romance and the beautiful setting, Anna was also faced with some opportunities to learn a lot about herself and others, so it was great to see her grow as a person. I think that's another thing that sometimes gets ignored...when a character goes through a life changing event you expect them to learn something from it and be a little wiser than they were when you first met them. Perkins pulls this off beautifully and it made for a very rewarding experience to witness Anna come to the realizations she did.<br /><br />If you are looking for a sweet romance with a cast of likable characters, look no further, this is the book for you. Prepare to be swept away...ooh la la!!o the realizations she did.    If you are looking for a sweet romance with a cast of likable characters, look no further, this is the book for you. Prepare to be swept away...ooh la la!!

B004BLJQOK|4.0|The vampire mythology is as old as the hills. Hollywood has spent nearly a century cataloguing all of the different facets of the crypt-sleeping, fanged beasts of the night. From Nosferatu to John Carpenter's Vampires to Twilight, the gamut has been run...and run...and run. In fact, this film is just a remake of a foreign success. So does it stand on its own two feet? Yes. Thanks to its deft production and characters. LET ME IN is a dazzling, morbid little picture with two stellar young leads at its center and while it does occasionally wallow in bucket-loads of gore, it has something of a real heart as well.   That's not to say that it isn't dark as dark can be. It is. The visuals are stark and haunting. From the opening frame of a cavalcade of police cars and an ambulance jouncing through snowy hills at night, to the violent finale, this is a film that positively immersed viewers in its grim world. This is not a film for children. It contains overwhelmingly graphic blood-letting sequences and one very nasty facial burn. There is also a cycle-of-abuse subplot that doesn't end in what one might call a \\"healthy\\" fashion. Overall, there is a lot of tension to be had in the film. Several scenes are stand-alone and amazing, begging for repeat viewing. One encounter at a gas station is rewind-right-away and re-watch good.   The lead characters are amazing. Chloe (Hit-Girl) Mortiz knocks this one out of the park. She is believable, graceful, and just plain captivating. The boy keeps up. The old detective and the father are also very convincing. Their shopworn character-action vibes suited the tone of the film. Though their relationship is the definition of unnatural, the two young kids will have most audience members feeling for their plight by the time the credits roll. It is amazing that they are as young as they are and able to convey such adult emotion.   This is a very dreary but paradoxically energetic film with a lot of surprises and an excellent score. The production values rock. The story is rather fresh and engaging. If you have the stomach for some very mean-spirited and occasionally view-through-your-fingers gore, you'll experience the most unconventional \\"love\\"/coming of age story of the past decade, even if it is a remake.
B003OCWF6I|2.0|Brief review of the movie only.  So-so acting (least impressive is the main villain).  Zoe Saldana is easy on the eye.  Some stunts in particular are well beyond realistic. There are better action flicks to spend your time on.

The blood part, a little too....hoakey, still added to the overall affect of the video. I can't wait until this season is over so I can order the videos. (Don't have it on my cable TV selection.) Definitely not for those timid about violence or sex.
0805091742|4.0|Good light read that offers insight to processes and methodologies for improving and ensuring quality and compliance in almost any situation.
1936594293|5.0|I have read Pride and Prejudice several times. I think that this is most definitely one of the best novels written in the English language. Jane Austen explores the relationships between different sets of people. At the age of 16, I was never really into the \\"Classic novels\\", but when a friend recommended the book, and I saw the movie (which does not do the novel justice), I decided to try. I instantly fell in love with the characters and Jane Austen's works. Elizabeth Bennet is truly an inspiring character as the story is told through her, and her interaction with other characters clearly shows Jane Austen's view on all kinds of love. This is a novel that I would recommend to anyone who loves a good read!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I watch AMC for the classic movies not for the series that they have, I happen to see the 6 episodes that was showing on AMC. Mind you as much as I liked the show 6 episodes of the show was too short for the first season while watching I was wondering how this series would turn out but not bad I liked it and the make  up was wonderfully done and it didnt look low budget and look forward to more shows to come. It's like watching a very long horror movie.<br /><br />The series is like a combination of 28 Days Later and  Night of the living dead with a tiny bit of Lost  if your a fan of these movies/ show.
B004IXFGZO|3.0|I am a fan of Yanni. Many of his songs mean a great deal to me. However, as with any talented artist who succeeds in staying around for decades similarities will pop up in the music ... real or imagined by the listener. I found this album to be an eclectic mix of past successes, perhaps calculated to highlight various strengths and styles over the years.     One of the biggest frustrations I have with new age music are the track names. Very rarely do the titles actually fit the tune. So to amuse myself and perhaps you Dear Reader below are the tracks renamed in a way that may be helpful in telling them apart and give a chuckle. Also included are my 1-5 Star Ratings, in case you think I just hated all of it and am poking fun, several tracks were very good and I enjoyed them.    1. The Rain Must Fall (Again?) ***  2. Subterranean Airport Walkway Light Show **  3. *See John Adorney **  4. Creepy Russian Movie Trailer ****  5. Island Taco (with too much salsa) *  6. Ethnic Bombast ***  7. Trippy Acropolis ****  8. Keep Waiting (to get on the radio) ***  9. Where Is This Going? (or Sex Filler) **  10. Oh Mio Another Italian Guy *  11. Deep(er) Forest Attempt #69 *  12. Chameleon Days 2 **  13. Finding Work for Trumpet Player *  14. Humpback Whale Humps Harpsicord **  15. Ends on a High Note ****    Thanks for taking the time to read my review. Please see it more as a loving roast than completely cynical mockery :)
B003UYUR0G|5.0|As an Avid gamer I loved playing Prince of Persia and played all 3 when they originally came out on xbox. I think they did this movie justice I was iffy when I heard Jake Gyllenhaal was doing this movie, but I'm amaze how good he was transforming into the character I even thought he looked so much. I remember playing the sands of time and think they got it down as the story line is similar with the sands, the Pronce and the Princess. Great action and amazing stunts and a wonderful story line. Would so recommend this as a watchable movie.<br /><br />Other than Prince of Perisa being one of my favorite games the next best thing I think is Call of Duty all of them.
B0038BBA4I|4.0|I only just learned about this band when I saw their amazing performance on the Grammys (sp?) last week.  It's been over 10 years since a \\"new\\" band made me want to immediately buy their album, but I went the next day and purchased their cd.  It is so refreshing!  Reminds me of Crosby, Stills, and Nash with a Celtic twist to it.  GREAT stuff.  I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it.
B004132HZS|5.0|I consider myself a fan of the Sherlock Holmes mythology. I especially liked the Granada Sherlock Holmes TV shows. So much so, that I purchased the entire series. The recent film with Robert Downey Jr. was very good and entertaining. When I disovered this version of my old friend Sherlock, I was immeadiately intereseted and purchased a copy. Although, Sherlock: Season One is set in our present time, have no fear, the producers have successfully kept Sherlock Sherlock. I like what they have done with Watson too. I hope they don't kill off Moriarity too quickly. Considering Moriarity... I didn't really care for this presentation. I always considered Moriarity as physically older than the actor they chose to portray him. But this is a petty prejudice. All in all, I heartily reccomend Sherlock: Season One and look forward to upcoming seasons. If you love Sherlock Holmes, buy it, you won't regret it.
B002VPE1OS|5.0|Bought many, many screen protectors, but these are awesome !!! We have 5 Iphones in our household and have been very frustrated with many protectors we have tried.  These fit correctly and have a great matte slick finish and are easly to apply without the typical airbubbles.  Usually I have to have my teenage son do it for me because I usually mess them up, but I did it myself and it came out awesome.............    Thanks Amazon.............
B00275EHJG|5.0|Came right on time, actually earlier then expected. My son loved it! He's watched it 3 times in a row.
0439023521|5.0|This is an outstanding read. It holds your interest right to the end. I would not be surprised to see this on the big screen one day.
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|My kids really love Disney movies & characters and have been really into Tinker Bell lately.  We have only seen the first Tinker Bell movie but we really enjoyed this one.  The story line is very sweet - my kids really liked it and it held their attention (they are 2 and 4). The underlying theme is the relationship between Tinker Bell and Lizzie, the spirited and friendly human who captures her in a fairy \\"trap\\", but the movie also focuses on the relationship between Lizzie and her pragmatic father, who is not as open-minded and believes only in scientific facts. The animation/graphics are great in this movie as are the voices of the cast - it's a sweet and endearing movie that brings back the classic-type of story lines that Disney has been know for.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Josh Groban has one of the most beautiful voices on the planet! This album is a departure from his others, but a good one. His voice is still beautiful and powerful but many of the songs on this newest collection are more personal and intimate - as well they should be since he wrote most of them. I don't care what the critics might say about him. Critics are like some teachers who exemplify the old adage, \\"If you can't DO, Teach\\" - bitter people with some axe to grind. There is no one currently performing who can do what Josh does, every time he sings - his orchestrations and other-worldly lush baritone simply transport me to a higher level. This new album of his is a treasure!
B002ZG981E|5.0|After seeing this movie again I began to get more of it.  It was even better the second time around.  This is definitely a must have, because you will need to watch it twice or more to fully get the scope of the director's intent, and every time you will enjoy it more.
B003UESJF6|3.0|This is a great movie for the whole family but especially kids and it is funny and teaches kids a good lesson
0891419063|5.0|I recently wrote a review on the Robert Leckie book, Helmet for my Pillow, which in my view, was a narrative of what he did in the war in the Pacific. On the other hand, E.B. Sledge in his book, With the Old Breed, wrote about what he witnessed in the war in the Pacific. For those readers who want to know about what the Marines had to deal with against the Japanese, read the latter. It is down right \\"chilling\\",  and at the same time, a very serious read about Marine combat in the Pacific theater.
0312430000|5.0|Atul Gawande is a treasure and it is too bad that his works are classified as medical books. There are treasures in all his books not only for physicians but for those in any profession. The central thesis of his work is that while professionals become better and more highly trained, they are losing their grsap of the fundamentals as those are pushed aside from more complex and advanced information. He draws not only on the medical profession but also goes back to Boeing's first test of a bomber which was crashed by its elite test pilots. Boeing concluded there was just too much for a pilot to keep track of and so developed checklists.  The use of lists has been extended to construction and other professions but was lacking in medicine.  This should be required reading in any college management course.
B002C6A6FY|5.0|What a great classic story of love and war!  Humphrey Bogart at his best, and Ingrid Bergman fits her part to perfection.  You have to see this movie!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Seriously.  How does it feel to fly?  No, I don't care about the aerodynamics, the lift forces, wing angulation, speed weight ratio.  I just would like to know how it feels to fly like a bird.<br /><br />How does it feel to be autistic?  How does it feel to have someone close to you who has autism?  No, not the reason why people have autism.  Not any medical facts and comparisons to the average norm.  No therapies, no holistic cures, no statistics.  How does it feel? . . . Well thats exactly what your going to come away with after watching this amazing movie.  The FEEL of it all.  Wonderfully translated by Claire Danes.  Perfectly captured by Mick Jackson.<br /><br />Your looking at a rarity.  After about 152 reviews there are no reviews less than 4 stars.<br />We fly in this autistic sky.......do you?<br />When someone is speaking to you and your mind wanders, is that being on the spectrum?  When John just didn't do so well at college ,but is a great carpenter  is that on the spectrum?
0618918248|1.0|If someone is a Christian with an open mind who still believes that Adam & Eve were the first humans, that the earth is 12,000 years old ,that God wrote each letter of the bible and that evolution is not true then I think they should wake up and this book might serve a purpose for them.  If your choice is either a fundamentalist religious person or an atheist then I think your choice would have to be atheist.  You would think this a very valuable book.    However If you are an agnostic who would REALLY like to feel comfortable either being an atheist or believing that a higher power created the universe, then this book falls flat.  If you are an atheist with a average science background then this book might help you feel smug and superior.  We used to think that the universe contained everything and that there were 3 dimensions.  If you have read books on quantum theory and a book such as 'Just Six Numbers' by Marin Rees (about the fine tuning of several different physical laws to allow our universe) then you come to the conclusion that either A-there are an infinite number of universes each with different physical laws and we happened to be in the one that allowed evolution of a higher life form or B-that this universe was developed by a higher power to allow evolution. Which is it and why?    I guess we will have to wait for science to develop past explaining how things work and get to explaining why.  I wish I could recommend a book that would help you on your voyage of discovery, but this one didn't help me.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|I'm so glad this film has been released on Blu-Ray. It's so incredibly crisp, and the quality is absolutely wonderful for a film released in 1997. Such a fantastic, beautiful, important film.
B0038QN2AS|5.0|A techno thriller at its best. and the most stunning in this debut is the hypothetical feasability. a page turner absolutely worth the buy.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I love these fellows....I have 4 of their cds.  They, by far, are my favorite.  I wish I could see them in person.
B004A8ZX2I|4.0|Unknown may be marketed as a sequel of sorts (at least in tone) to Liam Neeson's surprise hit of a few years back, but this is not the action packed thrill ride that Taken provided. This film is about 75% mystery/thriller and 25% action. In fact, there were only a couple of fight scenes and one neat car chase to fill in the gaps when the pace needed picking up. I agree with the other reviewer here who said they wished the twist came earlier and left more time for Neeson to kick some serious booty. Speaking of the twist, I couldn't figure it out and I felt it worked really well.<br /><br />Liam Neeson once again proves to be an unlikely yet very believable action star. You can't help but root for this guy. I hope he continues with these types of roles every so often. January Jones and Diane Kruger are here to look good, but only Kruger has a character worth any interest. There is a quiet scene with Frank Langella and Bruno Ganz that stands out.<br /><br />Taken or Unknown? Which one do I think is better? I'll take the action in Taken any day of the week, but I feel this movie has a stronger cast and a more interesting story. Too bad they couldn't throw just a little more Qui-Gon beatdowns into the mix. Still, this is a wild ride worth at least a rental, or maybe even a nice spot next to your copy of Taken.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|This product was shipped quickly and with no defects so it was put into my growing collection. Buy it, you won't be dissapointed.
B00136Q79I|5.0|This album is not for the weak. For anyone that likes insane guitar solos, and a drummer that  sounds like he has six arms and at times is shooting a machine gun at his bass drum this is for you. I have owned this album for as long as I can remember and it is still part of my daily routine. So if you need music for a workout, if you are falling asleep at the wheel, or if you just hate life, these are all good times to bring the REIGN!
B0002KQNUO|5.0|After seeing Alegria in person, I just had to have the soundtrack.  What a wonderful CD!  The music, lyrics and singing take you to another world. I love listening to it especially at night while I go to bed.  It's very relaxing.  I also like the fact that the songs are all in different languages.  I can't wait to get another Cirque CD if they are all this good.
B004DK5CW4|4.0|Should have focussed more on the Horse than Penny. Should have shown the Preakness, the way they showed the Derby.  Should have shown the Belmont in its entirety, (no mention of the fact that Secretariat beat the previous track record by 2 and 3 fifths seconds!)   Penny was not present at Secretariats birth!(...although it's a nice touch!)
B002FL3JA0|1.0|Due the slow index, multi-line titles, and a search method that results in anything but what you wanted, the kindle version is terrible for use on gigs. It takes forever to get a song up and once you do it opens to an empty page except for the copyright notice. You must then turn the page to get to the song. The design for kindle is a complete failure, stick with the paper version (preferably the old 5th edition). For kindle I suggest making your own charts and loading them into your kindle as pdf documents. It's worked great for me. Shame on Hal Leonard for such a poorly designed product.
0307010856|5.0|I remember reading this to my son when he was 4 yrs old, now he's 41.  It's a wonderful book, and if you can make your voice sound like Grover's, it's something a child will remember.
1439177783|5.0|After seeing Portia on the TV talk show circuit discussing her book, my interest was somewhat piqued.  I remembered her from Ally McBeal and always liked her, so I decided to read more about her life.  I was just a bit concerned that maybe all the discusson on TV would spoil the written word, but it had just the opposite effect.    I thought it was brilliantly written and contained just enough information on the disease itself without boring me to death.  Her detailed accounts of what she went through every day to maintain her \\"unbearable lightness\\" had me mesmerized.  It truly brought to the forefront what society expects of Hollywood stars, models and women of importance.  Very disturbing reading, yet I could not get enough.    Fortunately for her, there was a happy ending.  Unfortunately for me, I wasn't ready for it to end.  I loved it.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|I've always been conflicted about My Chemical Romance.<br /><br />On one hand, they've written some great songs. Quite a few, actually! But on the other hand, I've never found their obsession with \\"death as a metaphor for well, everything\\" to be all that interesting when stretched out to full album- and career-length. It just gets... exhausting.<br /><br />Which is exactly why Danger Days is such an amazing surprise. It takes all of MCR's greatest strengths - their melodic intensity, blistering vocals, and wide dramatic sweep - and removes the self-pity; replacing it almost wholesale with a sense of excitement and pure headlong ambition. Also, cyberpunk.<br /><br />What?<br /><br />Yes. As in, \\"motorcycles and bionic arms\\" cyberpunk. As in, less Edward Gorey, and way more [[ASIN:B001LMU182 Akira.]] Also way more synthesizers, pirate radio DJs, laser beams, and a veritable headrush of unexpected pop influences ranging from here to Black Eyed Peas.<br /><br />It should be completely ridiculous. And it kind of is. But it's ridiculous in the good way-- the \\"I can't believe they went this far\\" way-- and, ironically, by not taking itself so seriously, it ends up being in many ways a more impactful experience than their previous records; by turns epic, exhilarating, romantic, and wistful. (As opposed to sad, extra-sad, cancer, and dead.) It's a crazier world, sure-- but a far more vivid one. An exciting one. One you didn't expect.<br /><br />Apparently My Chemical Romance got bored of being their own stereotype.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Good, deep production - loud, and catchy, but with quieter layers of synth, effects, and vocal harmonies to reward multiple listens<br />-Evocative lyrics that toe the line between drama, irony, and humor with an unexpected self-awareness<br />-Stylistic experimentation across a wide range of influences that is both bold and more than a little crazy<br />-Suggests an intriguing action-cyberpunk-ish premise without being trite, confusing, or pretentious<br />-Is awesome<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Less personal and confessional in tone (which is probably more of a \\"pro\\" but still bears mentioning)<br />-Might inspire you to write really long reviews about how cool it is, wasting valuable time that could be spent listening to \\"Destroya\\" over and over and over again<br />-The end of \\"Goodnite Dr. Death\\" is painfully, obnoxiously loud and it could probably break something if you aren't careful, so consider yourself warned about that<br /><br />VERDICT:<br />It's fresh, it's funny, it's angry, and it's loud.

B000024ASD|5.0|Thanks for sending me my CD in mint condition. I had some very fond memories of this specific album. You simply can't go wrong with this compilation if you want to relive the vibes of SSS. I will rate this album 10 out of 10.
006621131X|4.0|A fascinating tale of artistic souls struggling to find their way during the late 60's and 70's.  Patti Smith's account of those early years with Robert Mapplethorpe gives interesting views of the artistic scene in NYC and the cast of characters that surrounded them and influenced them.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great work out video. I have been doing aerobics for over 20 years and this leaves me breathless. It is truly like having your own trainer in your living room. I have always been a little lazy building upper body strenth and this video will certainly do that. It's not often I find a exercise video that kicks my butt but this one does. Loving it!

1594202842|4.0|This book is a remarkably thoughtful and honest account of one woman's struggle to raise her two children according to a non-Western child-rearing philosophy, with all of the inherent triumphs and pitfalls lain bare for the reader. It has incited much anger in those who apparently see it as a prescriptive guide for parenting, but I think this anger misses the point. The message of this book is, appropriately I think, as ambiguous as its subject matter - parenting. In the end, it is clear that the author's own views on parenting have become less rigid due to the successes and failures she experienced with her two children, and she invites the reader to contemplate the soundness of their own parenting philosophy as she does so herself.     As a new stepparent of an 8-year-old, I am often asking myself questions of how much I can reasonably expect from my child and how much I can and should push to meet these expectations. The \\"Tiger Mother\\" who wrote this book expected a great deal and pushed to extreme amounts to get it. This worked really well with one daughter, who is clearly on her way to becoming a quite successful and well-adjusted young woman. But she was eventually forced to relent and adjust by her second daughter to avoid losing her. In the end, the author has been transformed by her experiences, and I think the open-minded reader will be too. Parenting is for the \\"Tiger Mother\\" like it is for the rest of us - a delicate balancing act and a struggle that forces constant thinking and rethinking of the assumptions we bring into it. This book provides great fodder to stimulate this type of thought, even as it leaves the answers up to the reader to figure out.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This movie is by far a lot better than the last two movies, and it might even beat the Goblet of Fire. The first three movies are the best, and this one is right up there with them. Some people think this was boring, but for me it was not at all. Even my friend who doesn't like Harry Potter loved this movie. I thought it was brilliantly made and this was one of those movies that are so good that you don't look to see what time it is and you don't wonder \\"is this almost over?\\".    Can't wait for the finale!
B001GCUO5M|4.0|Two federal marshal's show up at Shutter Island, a mental institution for the most dangerous of the criminally insane.  As the investigation of the disappearance of one inmate progresses, hints of bizarre possibilities unfold.  The culmination is disturbing and ambiguous.<br /><br />A brilliantly executed rendition of older themes.  Trouble in an asylum, conspiracy theories, layers of dreams and hallucination, and unclear presentation of reality are nothing new in cinema.  Smooth execution with gifted actors make \\"Shutter Island\\" not merely successful, but extraordinary.<br /><br />So what was *really* going on?<br /><br />E.M. Van Court
B003YFIUW8|5.0|By far one of the best and most original books i've read in a while. This book is hard to put down.

Very disappointing. Right now I would NOT recommend to purchase anything from this seller!!!!!!!! Amazon... you should consider dropping this seller as I am not the only one who has received poor service.
B000002G0P|5.0|This is one of the greatest rock albums of all time. I cannot speak highly enough about it. The production, lyrics, melodies, musicianship are all second to none.  This release is infinitely better than the first two Extreme albums and would never be topped in subsequent releases, either.    I can't help but wonder just how huge Extreme would have been if they had come out in the 70s as opposed to the 90s..this album would have been hailed as great as \\"The Wall\\" and the band would be playing stadiums today.    However, sadly, it wasn't meant to be as Extreme became popular at the tail end of the hair-metal movement that they were unfairly lumped into in first place
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Her writing style made it easy for me to absorb the darkness of this information. I have read a great deal about the holocaust and I felt her's was a new perspective.  I did enjoy the interweaving of the \\"today\\" story into the book.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I absolutely loved every minute of this book and did not want to put it down. It is long, but I read it in two days.   So  nice to have a vampire/ witch book that is not made for teens. This one is definitely for adults and includes a lot of history mixed in.
1596680296|5.0|This is the best sock knitting book out there.  It explains the basics for those who have never knit socks.  The patterns are fool-proof and they actually FIT people even if you haven't measured their feet.     I used this book to teach myself to knit socks and it made everything so easy to understand.  She has patterns by \\"stiches per inch\\" so you can buy yarn - figure out the \\"per inch\\" number and then just follow the pattern!  It's so easy.  Most sock patterns require a specific yarn and/or gauge - it can be a pain.  I use this book over and over again - and have bought copies for friends.      Get it - you won't be sorry.  It's the first and last sock book you'll need!  I love it!
0061998885|4.0|Lehane's return to the Kenzie-Gennaro story is hard to do following a book as masterfully crafted as Gone, Baby, Gone. Predictably, Lehane fails at writing a book that is as good, but as it seems he didn't set out to, there's no harm there.<br /><br />The beginning of the book, a dream sequence of Patrick with a fictional son, is confusing. While it comes up again, that it's a son doesn't seem necessary or overly important. From there, there is a feeling of concern as to whether the author has done his best work and doesn't know it yet, or if he'll be able to deliver a strong story.<br /><br />While there are parts of this book that feel a bit redundant, all in all the mystery is good. The story becomes very complicated in a good way, and the suspense is as such that I actually stayed up all light reading because I wanted to know more.<br /><br />The end is action packed, but makes you wonder if Kenzie has crossed the line from P.I. to vigilante, whether that character would do that, and whether he'd really be able to get away with it.<br /><br />A huge plus in Prayers for Rain is the major development of Bubba's character. Usually a lovable psychopath with unlimited resources, we learn more about Bubba's relationship with Kenzie, his personality, and his genuine ability in warfare.<br /><br />While in total this book may be a subpar effort by Lehane, a subpar Lehane effort is still better than most authors best days. With that, the book is worth reading, the adventure is worth having, and the love of these characters remains strong and better developed.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|Ok so this is not a bubble gum... mass produced chicken feed spread around for simple people MOVIE! This is a FILM! It is a fantastic film by the way. Everyone trashing this film clearly doesn't understand film and the nature of films. If you are looking for James Bond or Jason Bourne go watch those MOVIES. But if you are looking for something intelligent, beautiful, and more akin to Akira Kurisowa; then you might just want to give this FILM a chance. You might also want to give the book a chance as Martin Booth's novel is even better than the film. Or maybe you're just not the type of person who reads or watches good cinema... maybe go try Date Night instead....
B0034U4QLM|5.0|A blend of Irish and Mexican music that brings to light and life the story of the San Patricios, Irish immigrants conscripted into the Union Army in the middle of the 19th Century, badly treated by their officers, and who deserted to go over to fight on the Mexican side in the Mexican War of 1845.  Only complaint is technical; when I download my favorite tunes on to my iTunes collection, I can't send them to friends, it all turns out script instead of music.  If you buy the luxury package you get a DVD of the making of the album which is marvelous.<br /><br />Jeffry Wilkinson
B0017I1FP8|4.0|The Batman world has developed, unfortunately for the characters and fortunately for Batman fans, into a much darker environment, at least compared to Batman Begins. The music developes with this trend also, and it should in order to fit the movie. Wherea's in Batman Begins the main theme, heard in \\"Eptesicus\\", is naive... in The Dark Knight it has evolved into what we appreciate in \\"Like a Dog Chasing Cars\\". It's the same theme, only it has grown darker, like the characters, like the story... like everything in a more mature Batman world.    Personally, I find both soundtracks ideal for meditation, BUT The Dark Knight is, ofcourse, filled with more anguish, as if no hope was left for good to fit in such a dark atmosphere.    This is heavy stuff, because it's a heavy movie filled with a lot of reality concerned to our modern society. It is not a superhero film, in fact the track \\"I'm Not a Hero\\" should leave that clear. Christopher Nolan took advantage of the Batman force (millions of fans) to criticize society in a very truthful and respectful way. Now, this soundtrack is complex, contrary to what others may think, and I recommend it if you can listen or see beyond the obvious. It is not romantic, nor adventoruous, nor heroic, nor relaxing, nor nostalgic. It's chaos with meaning.
1400052173|5.0|Fascinating from a scientific point of view, Rebecca Skloot is an excellent science writer, who makes the science understandable to a lay person. And the humanitarian story of Henrietta and her family is truly moving. As is the case with all really good books, I've thought of it long after.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Below is an excerpt of my full review of the Mistborn trilogy:<br /><br />I believe that the true genius behind a great story is in its simplicity in execution, and Sanderson did that with his characters, the magic system he created and in unfolding the many secrets that kept me asking questions. I love a good mystery, and while the Mistborn trilogy is a fantasy/science fiction book, it has a good level of mystery intertwined that does not get in the way of the plot and further enhances the story. You can walk away from the books with concise, well thought reasons to how it all played out. I had several questions after finishing The Final Empire, but at my friend's suggestion, I continued reading so as to prevent spoiling myself. This is how I believed Lost would have ended, with answers truly being answered and not simply thrown into place for the sake of things. It goes back to deus ex machine, or the lack thereof. This book delivers in so many ways.<br /><br />There are many characters in the book and initially I thought that perhaps I would become inundated with character overload, but that did not happen. The interaction between characters is believable. No one says the right thing at the right time all of the time, mistakes are made, facts are proven wrong, and secrets reveal a greater wisdom than one could have imagined. It takes a great story teller to have their audience sympathize with a tyrant and become attached with so many characters. The trilogy even has a love story involved, and much like everything else, it is believable and fits.<br /><br />Words such as hate, love, and epic are grandiosely used in society and on the web so much that they have greatly lost their value and significance. When I called this story epic, I sincerely mean that it is one of the best stories I have ever read.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|This is the best known version of George Bernard Shaw's play \\"Pygmalion.\\"  The Hollywood musical builds on the Broadway musical because it is not constrained by stage settings and scenery.  It might have been better if they had retained Julie Andrews (who played Eliza Doolittle in the Broadway production) but it is still an all time classic musical.  There are some changes from the original Pygmalion, and that might offend some purists, but the musical version came out great.  Most people are familar with the motion picture as it periodically shows up on TV, so I will not go into detail about the plot.

0802130208|5.0|\\"When a true genius appears, you can know him by this sign: that all the dunces are in a confederacy against him.\\" --- Jonathan Swift    Is the protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly a true genius?      Not being a genius myself, for me it was hard to tell.  Most would agree that there is an extremely fine line between genius and insanity.     Is Ignatius merely insane?  Once again, not being insane myself (hopefully) it was hard for me to tell.      Either way, he certainly exhibits the characteristics usually associated with both ends of the spectrum.    Being unable to recognize or appreciate his genius, but being particularly sensitive to his apparent psychosis, the wide variety of \\"dunces\\" that populate this story are most assuredly in league against Ignatius.      Is he exceedingly brilliant ... or is he simply out of his mind?      You, the reader must decide.  The author provides no real guidance or substantive insight.      Ignatius J. Reilly is what he is.    True genius, or totally out of his mind, Ignatius J. Reilly is at once among the least likeable and most interesting characters in all of modern literature.  You will find yourself pulling for him, all the while  knowing that you would not want to spend any significant amount of time around him.    This book has been sitting on my shelf for years, unread.  I meant to read it many times, but I just never got around to it.  This past month, I finally finished \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" and I'm glad I did.  I think you will be too.
B002UZCJ8Y|1.0|There was a place and time when I flocked to his movies.  I really thought he had something that most actors didn't have, and I still consider his contribution to 80's/90's cinema to be outstanding.  He truly was an underrated cinematic accessory.  Still, his movie choices as of late have been less than desirable, and while I was initially intrigued by `Surrogates', it wound up being one of the worst films I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />The film takes place in the not so distant future when life as we know it is completely different.  Human beings have the option of being pushed to the outskirts of civilization by bucking the trends or caving into a new way of life, living in a chair while you mentally move your robotic counterparts like chess pieces around the world.  Life is devoid of consequences as you live out your fantasies from your living room sofa.  The good life, packaged and sold to the consumer, finally shows its flaws when two humans wind up dead after their `surrogates' are murdered.  The failsafe didn't work, as promised, and soon the police are investigating.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I understand the type of movie this was supposed to be and so its not like I had my hopes high, but the film just feels so cheaply constructed.  Yes, the visuals are in tact (for the most part) and the way they used CGI to smooth out the surrogates was intriguing, but the plot was poorly conceived and the films overall construction felt bare.  It wants to be a character piece, but it doesn't take the time to really flesh anyone or anything out.  In the end it becomes `just another' action film, except this time the script is so ridiculous that you become turned off entirely.  The acting is also a big question-mark.<br /><br />I wanted to like this but I found it impossible to do.
B003DTMUOE|5.0|El Alquimista lo leí hace muchos años y siempre fue mi libro favorito.  Dejé de leer libros espirituales y me dediqué más a leer libros de historia y de actualidad.  Encontré la versión para el Kindle y decidí leerlo de nuevo.  Yo no soy religioso, ni espiritual ni nada que tenga con ver con lo abstracto, pero al volver a leer este libro, recordé por qué siempre fue mi favorito.  Lo describiría como refresescante, interesante y al terminar de leerlo, una sensación de bienestar y la satisfacción de haber invertido tiempo y dinero en un maravilloso libro.  No hay que ser religioso ni espiritual para disfrutar a Paul Coelho, mi autor favorito.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|I really liked the first Twilight movie and was sorely disappointed in the the second one, although the last 20 to 30 minutes were pretty exciting. Eclipse is easily the best of the series and I can safely predict that will still hold true after the 4th movie is out.  I liked Eclipse so much, I decided to buy the 4th book now instead of waiting for the movie.  After reading a few reviews and a plot synopsis of the 4th in the series, I decided to definitely not waste my money on the book.     Eclipse held every second of my attention from beginning to the closing credits. The balance of character development, plot structure and suspense as well as great action (despite far fewer and noticeably less elaborate/expensive special effects than the first 2 movies)made this movie the best.  I really cared about the characters and their futures. In the first two movies it was more about fascination with the situation than about the characters.     Editing, sound, cinematography and general technical aspects seemed far tighter in the third of the series. The dialogue was more real, probably because by now I have fully accepted the implausible relationships of human girl, vampire family and werewolves.  The characters became more likable as we learn more about them and not so much about what is happening around them.  This is really a well done movie.     At the end we can see Bella's plans and predict what we would hope happens in the next in the series.  Without spoiling anything, I am sure the 4th movie, like the second, will not fulfill the promise of Eclipse. There are a dozen better ways to end the series than what happens in the next installment. I will watch the movie some day but will not waste my time on a 700+ page book with the events I have learned.  Unless the next movie just about rewrites the book, as many reviewers have suggested should be done, you might want to just watch Eclipse again instead of buying the last movie.  Eclipse does not stand on its own, since it is part of a series, but is the only one to own if you had to pick just one.

It was very dry and it just did not move me at all! Don't waste your money on this movie, I would suggest renting it!
0670022411|5.0|As all readers know, a good book is something that can transport you into another world and leave you with an insatiable desire for another trip. This book does just that.<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches is sure to be one of the \\"hottest books\\" of 2011, and I dearly hope that Ms. Harkness plans on writing a sequel! What the whole world loved about Twilight is in this book-- and is made even better by the absence of teenage angst, and high school. A masterpiece, not only because of it's ability to bewitch me, but because magic, witches, daemons, and vampires are \\"in.\\"
0425188809|5.0|I have now read 17 Koontz books but this one was PERFECT! An absolute masterpiece that will thoroughly entertain while leaving a deep and abiding impression upon the reader's mind and heart. Watchers delves deep into the power of love and does so while capturing all the elements of a good suspense thriller. I could not put the book down once I allowed my heart and mind to be fully engaged in the power and beauty detailed in this riveting masterpiece. I am now a bigger fan of Koontz than I've ever been. The character development, ending, writing, and humor of the novel were BRILLIANT. In other Koontz's books I've read, I've been disappointed by the endings, but WATCHERS delivers with a powerful ending of suspense.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|My above title says it all. I like this film more and more every time I watch it. Casino Royale set a new standard for the franchise and Quantum of Solace falls short of its brilliance. However, it is a perfect follow-up and does tie up the loose ends for those who take the time to understand what is really going on. It is best watched right after Casino Royale, and will take a few viewings to really appreciate its nuances.
0439023521|5.0|Violence is a very entertaining industry, but can you imagine killing other children and teens just so you could stay alive? Suzanne Collins takes aggressive reality television to the next level in one of her newest books called The Hunger Games published in 2008. In this young adult science fiction novel Collins gives us a firsthand look at what it is like to be controlled under a cruel dictator and used as an expendable pawn in the gruesome games of survival. This piece of science fiction has a very truthful ring to it and is a great reminder that we should be thankful for the freedom we have as a nation.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a very well written book, the dark sad world is easy to imagine as Collins delivers a crisp and detailed believable world. As you get to know the characters you start to feel as if you know them personally, which is very hard for me to do.[...] You will fly through this book and be thirsty for more. The Hunger Games is highly recommended and should be added to your list of must-read books because of its captivating plot and well developed characters.
1439107955|3.0|There were many moment in the Emperor of All Maladies where I read with rapt attention, caught up in the intrigue of cancer researchers. But, at other times, and particularly during the last 100 pages or so I felt like the story ran out of steam. Great gains were made with chemotherapy, radiation and then gene research, all documented with incredible detail, but the ending left me wondering what was next. Where is the cure for cancer? Is it still out there, waiting to be found, or is treatment the best we can hope for? Also, given the huge amount of time spent on tobacco and smoking as a cause for cancer, I was surprised there was not a mention anywhere of diet as a possible cause of cancer. It took a long time for smoking to be discovered as a link to cancer; I wonder if diet (particularly the eating of meat and animal fats) will at some point be considered as sure a cause of cancer as smoking. To not have a single thing to say about diet (even if it's to say there's no medical link at this time) is somewhat of an oversight in a book of this size and scope. Overall, I enjoyed the book quite a bit, although I must say by the time it ended I was ready for it to be done.

B0034G4OVS|4.0|Frozen, starring Emma Bell (of The Walking Dead), Kevin Zegers (of Dawn of the Dead) and Shawn Ashmore (of the Ruins, and X-men), is a 93 minute surprisingly tense and tragic film. Directed and written by Adam Green who also did Hatchet.<br /><br /> It's a simple set up. 3 friends, Parker and Dan (boyfriend and Girlfriend) and Joe, who is Dan's best friend go snowboarding/skiing on Mt. Holliston in New England. Parker can't snowboard, but Dan is so sweet he spends the entire day with her on the Bunny slope for beginners; Joe on the other hand is frustrated that he can't ski down the big run and blames Parker for how lame this weekend has turned out to be. Classic third wheel syndrome. Dan manages to convince Parker to bribe the lift worker to let them ride all day for way less than the lift tickets actually cost. At the end of the day when they decide, after Joe complains at every opportunity, they grab their gear and head for the lift again. Only to find that its shutting down, Parker bats her pretty eyes and they are on it, but they are the last ones. The lift guy, and his coworker exchange words and an oversight happens and the lift is shut down for the night, actually for the whole week, which is worse!<br /><br />So these three, are stuck at the highest point on the lift, in the freezing cold. No lights, no food or water, and with faces exposed to the elements it doesn't take long for frostbite to eat away at flesh. It's the typical \\"how are we going to get out of this\\" scenario, but of course with the extra added bonus of freezing to death, razor sharp wire to cross, a jump that comes with probable broken bones, and wild animals.<br /><br />I really liked this movie, I love simply shot, decently acted isolation horror films like this. It depended a lot on the interaction of these three, and I wasn't disappointed. It used Gore in the right places, and tenderness at others, it was funny and heart wrenching as well. Completely worth a look, doesn't get 5 stars from me, but I still really enjoyed it.lly enjoyed it.
B00009RGBS|5.0|This is the greatest musical I have ever seen. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere and Queen Latifa are at their best. I am not a person that cares for musicals but my sister encouraged me to watch Chicago and I have watched it, off and on, for a couple years. So if you don't care for musicals give this one a try.
B004NFB4EO|2.0|Okay, so ever since Gaga announced that she would be releasing a single, I got very excited. I mean VERY excited, since I am a big fan of Lady Gaga, I have her previous album and most of her remix extended plays. So besides all this talk about her copying or taking the idea off the Madonna track \\"Express Yourself,\\" Let's be real. This track has some very good lyrics, I read the lyrics before the song, and they are not completely original but they are good and they fit. The instrumental if the song itself is good, it has some good synths, nice drum beat, but not much of a dance record. But I do think the instrumental is good and its catchy. The song as a whole is not that good, I mean I have been in several bands, I am a Disc Jockey and producer(underground). I have heard many different types of music from classical to Rnb, rap to Tropical, Amaricana to Rock, Reggaeton to Techno, House to Electro and so forth, But this track as a whole just doesn't make the cut. The only reason I even bought the track is because it has been requested for play and because it's Gaga. Otherwise to call this track mediocre is just wrong.<br /><br />A technical perspective: From a technical point of view, It does have the same chord progression as Madonna's \\"Express Yourself,\\" but honestly who cares? There are countless of other songs with the same chord progressions as others. The song has good dynamic range and production is not too shabby in terms of arrangement and instrumentation. It has some good transitions and  some bad transition, especially the transitions in the long intro. In terms of time based processing, It has good reverb and delay throws throughout the song. I think that the lead synth could have been brighter, or least even a better sound. The drums of course, (mainly the Kick drum) sound like they have great compression. Also the vocal harmonies, are nothing too special. She could have expressed herself (pun intended) in those harmonies with a little less laziness. Shecould have also used more background vocals as well. Overall its a balanced mix on the frequency spectrum. Good mix, good mastering, good lyrical themes but badly written song with a poor choice of sounds/instruments that might not necessarily fit with the song was directly trying to express.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Saw the whole season, but wanted to see it again and this was the best way to do so.  When is the second season coming out on video is what I want to know.  If you are a \\"vampire\\" story, movie, book lover you need this.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|The detail that was in the book and that got put into the film is amazing. They didn't leave ANYTHING out unlike some movies that were originally books. I give this a 4 star rating just because of that. The other star for the rating would be because of the actors. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are great together in this movie. Kind of like they feed off each other and it makes it better. Overall, buy this movie. If You loved the book, you will love the film just as much.
B003TZ9EGO|2.0|I absolutely love Lady Gaga so of course I'm going to purchase this CD.  But the remixes definitely leave something to be desired.  They are not the flowly, inventive kind of remix, they are the constant, repetitive thumping kind of remix.  I concluded after listening to it that it was ipod worthy but no need to keep the cd in my car.  And I think it makes sense to ponder, is it really necessary to make remixes of dance songs anyway?
0375842209|4.0|The Book Thief was a book that I had been hearing about for ages. I had heard an enormous amount of praise for it, and had been meaning to get to it. My YA Lit class gave me an excuse to read it and I really did enjoy it. I didn't find it amazing or anything, but certainly a book worth reading.<br /><br />I loved Death being the narrator. I thought this was so unique and made the story so much better. I loved how the past, future, and present were sort of woven into one. If any other character had narrated, I really don't think the book would have been as powerful and moving.<br /><br />The story was different than what I was expecting. But I really liked where it went. I loved the color imagery that Marcus Zusak used throughout the book*. The Book Thief was extrodinarily well written - one of the best written books I have ever read.<br /><br />I think the thing that kept me from loving it was the length. There were so many times where nothing really happened and the story was slower. That's okay on occasion, but I felt these passages were too frequent for me to truely love it.<br /><br />The Book Thief is a truely powerful book. It demonstrates the power of words and their impact. It will make you think a lot, and even after you finish the last page, the ideas and words will still be turning in your head.
0553381687|5.0|After growing up with lots of \\"classic\\" fantasy such as Tolkien, Donaldson, TH White, etc., I got to a point in my life in college and just after where I just didn't find hardly any newer fantasy-related stories interesting.  They seemed to only retread the ground that was covered by the books I read as a young adult.  I'd start a series like the Wheel of Time and just feel like I could already predict where the story was heading.<br /><br />This all changed one day.  I had been recommended this series and this book for a long time.  However, because of my change in tastes towards fantasy over recent years I always shrugged it off.  One day I found myself in a bookstore, bored and needing to pass an hour or so.  Browsed through the fantasy section and this book caught my eye and reminded me of how many people recommended it.  I picked it up and read the prologue.<br /><br />I then preceded to go buy the book and read the entire thing over the course of a couple days. I hadn't devoured a book like that in years probably.  Excellent writing and a gripping story.  The reality and heaviness of the world Martin has created is unlike any fantasy I have read since Tolkien.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for both fantasy and non-fantasy fans alike.
0486432068|5.0|Old-fashioned perhaps, but a constant reminder especially in these fast and furious times of the need to hold on to simple values, namely not getting so caught up in things, projects, becoming rich and famous, but remembering to care for each other.  The things and the fortune aren't worth much without it.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Wow. What can I say about this guy that would do him and his music justice? Admittedly, I didn't care for Just The Way You Are when it came out. That was the first time I had ever heard Bruno Mars. So much for first impressions. I mean, he sounds great in the song. It's just not my thing. Then I heard Billionaire and thought, \\"This guy sounds great. But does he ever sing on his own?\\"  Then I heard Grenade. Easily one of the best songs I've heard in the past 10 years. I can't stop listening to it. I'll try and do a little synopsis of the rest:      3. Our First Time: Slow, soulful song that has an 80s R&B feel to it. Great mood music for you and your baby. Bow chicka wow wow!  7/10    4. Runaway Baby: Funky beats. Rocking guitars. I defy you not to bob your head to this one. 8/10    5. Lazy Song: The best song Sublime never wrote. 7/10    6. Marry You: Another great song. I'm a straight male and I think I would even say yes to his proposal after this.  9/10      7. Talking To The Moon: My favorite song on the album, next to Grenade. Listening to this and Grenade back to back makes you realize some girl really did a number on this poor guy's heart. Beautiful song. 10/10    8. Liquor Store Blues: Very relaxed, reggae song featuring the awesome Damian Marley. If you have one rolled up, put this song on and light it up!  9/10      9. Count On Me: This song sounds more like a Jason Mraz song than all of the others on this album. Not a bad thing at all. You'll most likely listen to this song a few times in a row. 8/10    10. The Other Side: This is my third favorite song and what I feel will represent how his next album will sound. It features Cee Lo Green and B.O.B, but Bruno clearly owns this song. 10/10    As I said in the title, this guy will be around for a loooooong time. Michael Jackson (rest in peace) is gone. Say what you will about his personal life, that man had a powerful voice. The King of Pop is dead. Long live Bruno Mars.
0399536108|3.0|I agree with another reviewer that the book's title promises more than the book delivers. It's about Chris and his life, but isn't a good guidebook for those who want to find their own way. On the plus side, this book would be better received by young people, who need to ask themselves the questions Chris mentions in his early chapters: what do you want from life, what do you have to offer, and do you want to live according to society's expectations or your own? Those who have read other books on the subject, or who have more life experience, will have heard most of the messages before. I found it annoying that Chris stated (or implied) several times that those who live a conventional life are \\"asleep\\", living lives of quiet desperation, and that people who follow his example are \\"awake\\" and alive. I find this condescending, and I'd like to point out that trying to be different from everyone else is functionally equivalent to trying to be the same as everyone else; you're letting other people determine your life. As a scientist, I also differ with Chris on the value of a college and graduate education, because my experience has been different than that of a liberal arts major. He states that his master's thesis, if published, would have been read by few people. Leaving aside the issue of doing good work for its own sake, one never knows how one's work inspires further insights. My graduate publications have been cited hundreds of times, and I consider my contributions to science to be part of the \\"legacy\\" that Chris sees as such a desireable thing. I also note his total neglect of the value of domestic travel and volunteering. The US is a huge country, and there are many opportunities for unique experiences and there are plenty of people who lack clean water, nutrition, and health care who would benefit from the efforts of enthusiastic volunteers or nonprofit-founders. Similarly, I would expect a book with this title to at least give examples of other \\"non-conformist\\" ways of life that don't involve blogging and foreign travel: living off the grid, growing one's food, homeschooling children, joining a contemplative community. There are many lives that are rich in deep, subtle experiences; one doesn't have to look outward for more countries to consume or more legacies to create. To reiterate, this is a book about Chris and his life, not a guidebook for authenticity. (Full disclosure: I went to college and graduate school, worked for a corporation, left that to be a housewife, volunteer, and language teacher, went back to school in a different area, and have traveled a lot, but only to 11 countries.)
B001USHRCK|5.0|I grew up playing Legos with my brothers and sisters and we all had the best time. As kids we would have died to have an amazing set like this one. A beautiful set with the ability to make a realistic medieval village. Great toy! Would make a great gift!

0671027344|5.0|I finished reading the book and started to cry. I don't know exactly why, but that was what I needed to do. Maybe I did so because it's really easy to create a strong bond with the character, and it's always sad to say good-bye. Or it might be because it made me think about my own life and the way I'm living it. Or the reason may be as simple as the fact that I loved each single sentence of it.   The book really touched my heart, and I think it would do the same with every heart of a teenager or young (and not-so-young) adult, struggling with life, with decisions. I think it's the perfect book for every little girl or guy trying to find out who they really are. And for those who probably will never find it out, too.
B001CWOCUO|5.0|This is great.  I am 51 years old.  I am very impressed with this beautiful girl.  Yes I loved Madonna, Janet jackson ect., This is Rihanna's time.  She is great.  I loved the DVD.  I bought it just to look at her.  I was surprised to hear great pop music.  And a spirited performance that was obviously fun for the participants.  You can't help fall in love with this incredibly beautiful girl talking on the extras.  Rihanna is awesome.  I wish her nothing but success.  I hope to see more of her future performances on DVD.    Thank you Rihanna,  Mark Rodgers
B0006Z2KXE|4.0|Very good movie based off of a very good play.  It is probably one of the best movies for both Carey Grant and Katherine Hepburn.  Jimmy Stewart did many many movies to be proud of so that's hard to say the same for him in this movie.  I haven't watched all the DVD extras for this movie just yet, but I am greatly looking forward to it.  DVD came in great condition and was a great value.  Only small criticism I might have is that the film sometimes looked weird on my HD TV, but that probably has something to do with the upconvert.  I would have rather watched in a standard def mode to enhance the old black and white film.  I would highly encourage any fans of the film to go watch a stage production of the show sometime.
B002BFBAWO|3.0|Adventureland is a light movie, not too intense but it's till engaging. If for nothing else , one can watch it for Jesse Eissenberg's performance. He is amazing. Ryan Reynolds and Jon Hader have acted very well too. It is not a laugh out loud comedy but it's funny in some parts. It's not a feel good or touching romance but enjoyable none-the-less. It's not as raunchy as say Superbad but it has its moments. The plot is light. Yeah that's the word -- light. Too many references to drugs that were unnecessary in my opinion, they didn't add anything to the story. Parents were too cliched. Not a bad movie.
B004J8HWS2|3.0|This is a book where the author becomes the book. I've never had any interest in the subject of mountaineiring and I don't realy know why I decided to buy this book. But the fact is that Mr. Archer is the master of the masters when telling a story. His touch is unique and the result is fantastic. I gave it 3 stars because I realy didn't find the subject an atractive one, but the storytelling is what makes it worth. For those who have read other Jaffrey Archer's books I recommend this one to be in your \\"to read\\" list. You won't regret.
B00337KM2S|4.0|This is a good movie about a guy who is beginning to question his life - as a motivational speaker who fires people for a living - after a very successful career.  He meets this terrific woman, with whom he shares an hilariously low-key cynicism, in an airport bar on the way to one of his many road trips to whatever kind of a place to fire some more people.  He goes on a roadtrip with a neophyte hotshot that gets him to think a bit more.  They see a succession of airports, hotels, and wounded faces.  It is really quite depressing, but also very funny, kind of warm but knowlingly superficial.<br /><br />Of course, it doesn't work out the way he thinks it will, but he finds himself back on his routine. Nothing is resolved, there is nothing deep, no insurmountable tragedy, just life in America.  And beautifully done.<br /><br />REcommended warmly.
B0024F08RO|4.0|I got the other three season in hard core packs that looked very nice. Although I liked those that way, I found this cover very easy to handle and it also looks nice, smaller but cds-protective. The contents are just what I was expecting them to be and this series is awesome!
B0028RXXE8|5.0|We just watched this again after a long time and once again, I found myself utterly riveted not just by the wonderful (creative) historical reconstruction but for the subtlety of its view of human possibility and pathological seekers of power.  This series pleases on many levels.<br /><br />On the one hand, the historical details are very fun:  it is the fundamental turning point of antiquity, when the Roman Republic - the last important proto-democratic experiment that had lasted 450 years - is rubbed out for good.  Julius Caesar, the greatest Roman military genius of them all, will not accept the political maneuverings of his personal foes, who wrap themselves in the call to preserve a republic that had long ceased to function.  Either Caesar is a villain bent on dictatorship, or they are demagogues - it is left to the viewer to decide.  Once Caesar is assassinated, another kind of political genius emerges, Octavian (later Augustus), who at the age of 19 climbs to the summit of power in Rome and then a few years later wins power as an enlightened despot/dictator.  You get to know Cato, Cicero, Marc Anthony, Brutus, Servilia, Cleopatra, and Agrippa, to name just a few of the characters who are all acted to perfection.<br /><br />On the other hand, you have the psychodramas that are going on behind the scenes.  Not only does Octavian's family, shall we say, operate with literally murderous dysfunction,  but you have Vorenus and Tullo, two more common soldiers who embody different aspects of this transitional period.  Octavian's family is typical that of brutal courtier-aristocrats, as his mother Atia seeks to manipulate events to fulfill her need for love/domination and security.  But the two working class guys, who are highly fictionalized though apparently are mentioned in Caesar's histories and who witness events as they try to build healthier family lives and make their ways outside of the military apparatus, are the most interesting in my view; they provide a wonderful melodrama that reveals much about the society and its evolution.  Of course, they do get into a few too many situations to be believable (each of them kills, respectively Cicero and Marc Anthony, for example), but they are wonderful fictional vehicles to provide an alternate view from the elites as they compete for power and fulfillment.  In my view, Vorenus embodies the virtues of the old republic, while Pullo is a pragmatic survivor who is perfect for the new era.<br /><br />Sure, there are lots of brutally frank depictions of sex that make this unsuitable for anyone under 16 and the violence is equally graphic.  But Rome was at that time semi-barbarous in our terms, with few possibilities to improve oneself and quick, violent ends without the possibility of the rule of law or justice.  It gets one to think about what one has, at least it did for me.<br /><br />Recommended with enthusiasm.  There are so many wonderful details in this, such as the scene where Marc Anthony urinates in a plant as he is talking to Cicero or Atia covered in the blood of a sacrificed bull or her order to her son:  \\"don't come home until you have penetrated someone\\" [for the first time].  You will laugh, you will be moved, you will feel wonder at the panorama of history, you will desire to learn more.  Great stuff!ama that reveals much about the society and its evolution.

1401301363|5.0|This is one of my favorite cookbooks. Feast is organized by occasions and is menu based, and it provides all the recipes you could want for any special occasion. That is what makes the book so nice, it marks the way we eat, and celebrate. It feels special even to read it.    Of course, the writing is wonderful, as one would expect from Nigella Lawson. There is a lot of passion behind the writing and it is a wonderful read as well as a practical manual. It also offers wonderful insights into the festivals and eating habits of other cultures. However, the recipes are the main focus and these are great! The book is crammed with good ideas and is a huge resource for entertaining. I have had nothing but success from this book.    Personal favorites include: Spiced and Super Juicy Turkey, Fully Festive Ham, Pancetta Wrapped Sausages, Maple Roast Parsnips, Brussels Sprouts with Chestnuts Pancetta and Parsley, Rhubarb Crumble, Pink Picante Shrimp, Tagliata with Rosemary and Garlic Potatoes, Snowflecked Brownies, Massacre in a Snow Storm, Passion Fruit Curd, Baci di Ricotta, Chocolate Raspberry Heart, Andy's Fairfield Granola, Tunisian Stew with Aromatic Lamb Meatballs, Peach Melba, Old Fashioned Chocolate Cake, Mughlai Chicken, Pilaf for a Curry Banquet, Mutter Paneer, Zabaglione al Prosecco, Parma Ham Bundles, Cornbread Topped Chilli Con Carne, Big Pasta with Mushrooms Parsley Garlic and Thyme, Chocolate Cherry Trifle, and Spaghetti alla Carbonara.    The best compliment I can give is that this book has truly changed our festive eating habits. Thanksgiving and Christmas would not be complete without these recipes. Other menus have helped to create reasons for gathering together. The books subtitle is \\"food that celebrates life\\", it more than live up to this! I highly reccomend this (and all of Nigella Lawson's books.)
0670022411|5.0|I just finished reading this book and my only way to describe it would be to say that if you liked \\"Twilight\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", you'll love this story. It was fabulous and so fabulous that I could sit down right now, pick up the book and begin reading from the beginning. The author is coming to a bookstore in the city that I live in tomorrow night and I'm looking forward to meeting her and seeing the genius mind behind this most amazing story. Thank you Deborah Harkness for creating the most delicious characters.

0375703764|5.0|I first heard about this book through a friend of a friend--he had found the novel in a trash can while walking around with friends at 2:00a.m. down in Texas and picked it up. That alone intrigued me to read this book, and it certainly didn't disappoint. I devoured it in about a week and a half, spending my entire spring break reading in the car, in my bedroom (during the daytime), and at friends' houses. It grabbed me, set up shop in my head, and didn't leave until I read it cover-to-cover.<br /><br />One of the key aspects of the novel is a notion that personally scares the living daylights out of me: a house that defies all physics as we know it. What was so terrifying to me was that it started small, with two extra inches of space inside the Navidson house than outside. \\"It must have been a slip-up,\\" they figured, \\"or we bent the tape measure.\\" But of course that's never the case, and the house proceeded to shift and grow as fluidly as water. When a building can read your emotions, can reach into your thoughts and feed off of whatever you're thinking about, you as a homeowner lose all power and all assumptions that you are in charge. The house became as wild and as unpredictable as Mother Nature--except it could think.<br /><br />Danielewski is a literary genius. The thoughts and ideas behind this novel are so beyond my comprehension that his mind could only have been working at a thousand miles per hour to produce it, and what was born was priceless and something that can never be mimicked. It is, essentially, a story within a story inside a story. He writes the 3 different points of view--Johnny Truant, Zampano, and the Navidsons themselves--flawlessly, never faltering or hinting that any of the three knows that the others exist. And Johnny's slow but devastating unravelling is hypnotizing, and was the biggest hook that kept me turning page after page. As readers, we find ourselves becoming Johnny Truant, glancing over our shoulders and turning on the overhead light just so that no stray shadows can bounce around. It is certainly not a novel for the faint of heart or for the sensitive; the sexuality is graphic and beautifully raw, and the horror aspects that are unexplained are far more ghastly than the ones that are. Are we as humans responsible for the nightmares that chase us during the night? Or is there really something living inside our walls, be it a minotaur or the house itself? We never really know, and that's what keeps this book fresh in my mind 11 months later.hat no stray shadows can bounce around.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|Let me get this out of the way first. Squeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!! This review will be spoiler free. It will be vague with a lot of gushing. Don't say I didn't warn you.<br /><br />This is what we Fever fans have all been waiting for. We anxiously counted down the days to the release of the 5th and final book of the Fever series, Shadowfever. I pre-ordered Shadowfever for my Kindle and woke up at 3am on Tuesday morning to start reading it. O.M.G.! I finished Shadowfever that same day. Karen Moning delivered everything and more!<br /><br />Dreamfever ended with a hell of a cliffhanger. We were left wondering who Mac had killed. Shadowfever picks up right where Dreamfever left off. We get the answer to the Dreamfever cliffhanger at the very beginning and that reveal is a punch in the gut. Moning grabs you from the very first page and does not let you go until the end. There were lots of OMG and WTF moments while reading Shadowfever. There were so many twists and turns that I couldn't keep everything straight in my head. I used my Kindle's highlighting feature so much that I had a cramp in my thumb by the time I was done. Shadowfever was everything I wanted and more. I worried that with the book being over 600 pages, that it would not live it to the hype. For me, it did. There were parts that were drawn out and long. How could it not be? It has to be difficult to write a book of this magnitude and not have the plot slow down or stall a little. I suspected this would be the case before I started reading, so I wasn't too bothered by it. The endless paragraphs of Mac asking questions got annoying at times but I just skimmed over them. And maybe some things were wrapped up too neatly or exposed too late in the book. But I didn't care. None of these issues ruined the book for me.<br /><br />When I finished Shadowfever, I was exhausted and happy. And then I started discussing Shadowfever with some of my friends and wanted to read it all over again. And I still do. I am suffering from PSSS (Post Shadowfever Stress Syndrome). I can't stop thinking about it!<br /><br />Shadowfever was the perfect finish to an awesomely great series. It was the icing on the cake. It was everything I expected and more. Questions were answered but just as many new questions were brought to the forefront. One door closes and another one opens, leaving the possibility of a Fever spin-off series. So this is the end....for now.Stress Syndrome). I can't stop thinking about it!    Shadowfever was the perfect finish to an awesomely great series. It was the icing on the cake.

B002VPE1AW|3.0|\\"Avatar\\" may have had more hype beforehand than any other movie in the past decade. Alien worlds! Alien creatures! Alien plants! Epic conflict! Mecha! Blue cat-elves!<br /><br />So unsurprisingly, everyone expected James Cameron's epic space opera to be all-around brilliant in every way. And as a visual experience, Cameron dazzles us with otherworld visions of glowing plant life and strange alien creatures.... but the plot is basically the tired old \\"Pocahontas/Dances With Wolves/Last Samurai\\" chestnut, complete with forgettable acting and a bucketload of cliches.<br /><br />Crippled marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is summoned to the alien moon of Pandora, where he is offered a simple deal -- if he helps the Evil Military and Evil Corporation drive away the alien Na'vi so they can mine a mystery mineral from their lands, they'll heal him. So his consciousness is transferred to an alien \\"avatar\\" that allows him to contact the Na'vi.<br /><br />Of course, Jake quickly encounters the beautiful Princess Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and falls madly in love with her. As he gets to know the Na'vi (and of course, falls for their princess), he begins to turn against the Evil Military/Corporation's plans, and tries to help the Na'vi defeat them. In a nod to realism, the Na'vi are wiped out and Pandora becomes a colony of Earth... just kidding.<br /><br />\\"Avatar\\" is every bit as visually dazzling as they say -- luminous plant life like something under a tropical sea, floating islands, lush jungles, floating lights, sentient trees and weird creatures like giant ridable rays and multi-legged ground beasts. The entire moon of Pandora seems to be clothed in a magical haze, and you're left with the feeling that there is so much more on this world than what we've seen. This movie would have been enthralling visually even if if there was no plot.<br /><br />So where does it fall down? The plot, of course. Cameron is basically recycling a tired old chestnut -- a white guy encounters a primitive but \\"in touch with nature\\" native people, falls for a pretty native girl, and becomes the messiah/savior/leader of the natives and defeats the evil white conquerors. Throw in some environmental sermons and \\"The military is evil! Big business is evil!\\" preaching, and you have the basic plot.<br /><br />Even worse, it doesn't feel like Cameron was even TRYING to make this worn-out plot work. Instead, he runs down a long list of cinematic cliches (oh look, the primitive natives are able to defeat SPACECRAFT) and groanworthy dialogue (\\"All I ever wanted was a single thing worth fighting for\\"), culminating in a LITERAL deus ex machina. In short, the plot is a haphazard sloppy mess.<br /><br />Also, the characters are WRETCHED -- military and corporate people are all evil greedy soulless jerks, except for a handful of pure-hearted scientists who all are on the Na'vi side. And while Saldana does a very good job bringing heart and soul to a CGI cat-elf, Worthington is HORRIBLE. A plank of wood would have made Sully a more engaging and tormented lead. Much better actors like Sigourney Weaver, CCH Pounder and Stephen Lang are horribly underused or misused.<br /><br />\\"Avatar\\" is undeniably the most visually dazzling movie produced in a very long time... but unfortunately, James Cameron apparently decided that a visually dazzling movie doesn't need a plot.

6304007523|5.0|Rocky Balboa, a guy who can barely hold his own in the ring against bad amateurs and beats up guys who can't pay his loan shark pal.  He has a crush on a super-introverted pet shop girl, and talks to his turtles and goldfish.<br /><br />And yet, he's a contender for the world heavyweight championship!<br /><br />The film won several Oscars and it's not surprising.  The fast pacing of the film, the long music interlude with its rousing horns and nearly disco back-beat, really struck a chord with audiences in the 1970s.<br /><br />In rewatching Rocky, I noticed a few themes:  the obvious one of a man who is just barely getting by given a chance to make it as a boxing champ.  Another theme is the corporation that is boxing, with Apollo Creed making like it's a show for the audience, complete with red, white & blue underwear and riding in on a float.  Is this the result of a man who wins fights?  Arrogance?  Wow!<br /><br />And then there's the theme of others wanting to take advantage of Rocky's name and see if they can make a buck off of him, specifically his girlfriend's brother, a drunk who is sour and jealous of Rocky's new-found celebrity.  The Christmas scene with the baseball bat is really the only dark part of the film, yet is poignant in its display of drunkenness and jealous rage!<br /><br />And then there's Adrianne.  She comes out of her shell, a shell that's so hard to break through that her own brother thinks she's a loser or that there's something wrong with her.  Rocky's innocence and sympathetic manner pull her through to a dramatic ending at the end of the Creed/Balboa fight that just sends chills.<br /><br />It's a rare film that even with its occasional cheesiness can pull out all the stops, where the acting comes together, the music soars and ... does he go the distance with Creed?  Quite a film!<br /><br />DVD:  My DVD only had English, French and Spanish titles and scene selections.  Alas, that's it!<br /><br />Directed by<br /><br />John G.

B002ZG99TA|3.0|There was a 1986 film called RUNAWAY TRAIN with Jon Voight. There was the exciting 1974 version of THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE with Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw. There was the not-too-exciting 2009 version of THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3 with Denzel Washington. Everybody I knew who had seen the original was convinced it was going to suck, and it did. Nevertheless, Tony Scott liked his own work in PELHAM 1 2 3 so much that he immediately rehashed it with UNSTOPPABLE, another Denzel Washington movie. Denzel, who used to do Oscar-caliber work such as PHILADELPHIA and MALCOLM X, is definitely on the downside of the hill and is in danger of being typecast as Choo-Choo Charlie. In PELHAM 1 2 3, he played the emotionally conflicted subway dispatcher. Here, he plays an emotionally conflicted locomotive engineer.<br /><br />UNSTOPPABLE is the story of a freight train loaded with hazmat cars that somehow gets away from the railmen and, engineerless, goes careening through rural Pennsylvania toward a large city. If the train derails in said large city, it will be the American Chernobyl. While this disaster is hanging over their heads, three quarters of everybody in Pennsylvania is standing around near the tracks watching and waiting for the train to derail. In real life, the mass evacuation spoken of in the film would have been a panic-stricken mass evacuation, not an excuse for a Statewide block party. Denzel is the engineer of the lone locomotive that is chasing the runaway train in order to hook up and possibly bring the thing to a halt safely. Unfortunately, UNSTOPPABLE never really gets moving; despite the suspenseful premise, the film lacks any real suspense since it is so full of cliches and set-piece action that we know how the film is going to end just as soon as it starts.<br /><br />There are no surprises in UNSTOPPABLE. We've seen it all before, and although it's worth a watch, it's not really as \\"unstoppable\\" as it is \\"totally forgettable.\\"
0307272702|3.0|I got the audiobook version and finished it in one day! The author writes well and the book was very informative.    By this time almost everyone in the Western world has heard of low-carb diet and it has millions as its supporters. It that sense the book does not break any new ground. However, it described the scientific theory and history behind the diet and it was interesting.    However, the author does seem to show some disdain for vegetarians and vegans and mentions that while they may not become lean they can eat healthy. In one recent interview he stated that he has seen obese vegans. While exceptions are in any population it will be hard pressed to claim that vegetarians on average are not lean (compared to meat-eaters.) (Just visit a vegetarian restaurant and check the belly sizes of its patrons. And then go to McDonald's to do the same.) And he does not realize that the obese vegans he is meeting were perhaps morbidly obese on meat-centric diet before embracing veganism to lose weight.     Most glaring was virtual ignoring of vast populations of the world who follow low meat-eating diets. Parts of Africa, India, China and Japan easily come to mind. In India, the male population's BMI is 21 which is slightly lower than what it was 25 years ago in spite of much more availability of food now. In Japan which is a developed country the average BMI seems to be 22. In contrast USA's average BMI is about 28! Failure to mention such facts and explain why is bad science since in places like Southern India the diet seems to be 80-90% carbs and that too mostly refined, but the population seems to be very slim. It just goes against what the book has been promoting.    And then recently I read an article on internet about vegetarian MMA male athletes in the USA. One of them mentioned partaking of fruits very frequently. Yeah, that fructose that causes fat! And then I checked out their images in Google search and found all of them to be very fit with minimal amount of fat on them. And check out other athletes like Scott Jurek, a vegan.

0439023513|3.0|i liked the first two books better than the third. mockingjay definitely has a different feel from the first two books. really this kind of YA is just barely my genre, so maybe i'm not the best judge. i like the background. katniss is engaging and believable, not super woman, and that's good writing but not exactly how we've been trained to think of heroes. we expect more. so when a writer goes against type, it's risky. i almost gave this book four stars but it didn't quite gell me for in the end.
B003RYA17I|5.0|Since Savall built his brand AliaVox, he has been produced more and more outstanding output, I think Celtic series would be one of the best his legend. His celtic series are with full of local but strong Irish characteristic, which is easy to touch and love it. It's very different with his other CDs of elder music, which were sometimes not easy to understand. So I suggest whoever you are Savall's fans or love the Irish style music, you should own it to try, of course these both of vol. 1 &2 together
0670022411|4.0|There are so many similarities to \\"Twilight\\" that it ooozes them throughout the novel.   The history though is rich and intermingled well. If you have not read the 'Twilight saga\\"  and enjoy fantasy you will enjoy it more.  I really hope part two becomes more adult and takes  on its own relationship with the main characters. It has great potential and it will be interesting  to see what the author does.

0767903862|5.0|I read this book prior to first traveling to Australia a few years ago and ended up learning more about the country's history and people, etc than even my boyfriend knew..... and he was Australian! Now, after having lived in Australia for several years, I still recommend this book to friends and family who are planning to visit because I think Bryson does an excellent job of capturing all that is unique and special about Australia. A must read.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is one of the most outstanding movies I have seen. The dog's loyalty and love for its master is an illustration of beautiful devotion. Even if one is not a dog owner Hachi's example reminds that we as human beings were able to see loyalty and love in action. The film could influence people to treat their loved ones in that inspirational way. To know there actually was a dog that lived that loyalty in Japan makes the film even more laudible.
030726999X|2.0|Reading this series was akin to torture. By the time I got to the last book, I was skimming pages at a time. I did want to know the outcome so for that I give it 2 stars. Otherwise I was hugely disappointed given the high praise. I found the writing tiresome in so much that the story could have filled one book not three.
B000LC4B3Y|5.0|The Chorus I sing  with is  preparing this  for  concert in March. The  recording is an  excellent performance.  Although  our  director  has a different  interpretation of  the  piece, it  is  a great  way to immerse  oneself  in the  Glory of  Haydn's Creation.
B000002L7G|5.0|It is difficult to believe that \\"Brothers in Arms\\" was released all the way back in 1985 (May 13th), and was one of the first new albums to be aimed at the CD market, with a full digital recording (DDD).  The album mixed a variety of sounds, along with a very clever MTV inspired hit (\\"Money for Nothing\\") which pretty much guaranteed massive success in and of itself.  Instant success never guarantees long-term success though, so the real strength of this album comes from the strength of the tracks which continue to be played and in demand 25 years later, and undoubtedly for a long time to come.    The album opens with \\"So Far Away\\" which was also the first single from the album, released a little over a month prior to the album itself.  The song is a simple one, about being away from the one you love, a common theme for rock stars who are often on the road.  Next up is the massively successful \\"Money for Nothing\\", with guest artist Sting co-writing the song and providing some of the vocals.  The video for this song launched, i.e. was the debut video shown on, MTV Europe, and was a massive hit on MTV in the U.S. as well.  The video and song became the target for Weird Al Yankovic in his film UHF, with Mark Knopfler contributing the guitar work and Guy Fletcher the keyboards.  Unlike many songs which touch a social nerve, \\"Money for Nothing\\" has survived its early success and continues to be a fan favorite, in spite of, or perhaps aided by its controversial lyrics.    \\"Walk of Life\\" is next, the fourth single from the album, and another big hit both with the video as well as the song itself.  It has kind of a rockabilly feel to the rhythm, providing a different sound from anything else on the album.  \\"Your Latest Trick\\" is the fifth single from the album, and contains a wonderful saxophone intro.  \\"Why Worry\\" is a slow piece, and at over 8½ minutes it is also the longest piece on the album.  \\"Ride across the River\\", \\"The Man's Too Strong\\", and \\"One World\\" are all solid pieces which grow on the listener, though none is what one would call a single.  The album then closes with the title track \\"Brothers in Arms\\", my personal favorite due to its lyric.  It is an unusual choice for a single, and yet it was the third single from the album and did fairly well considering the serious subject matter, slow pace, and long solos.    \\"Brothers in Arms\\" in many ways is the album that killed the band.  After its release the band went on a very long tour and broke up in 1988.  The result was that it was six years before they would reunite and release another studio album which, at least so far, is the last from the group.  Nor was the following album (\\"On Every Street\\") anywhere near as successful as its predecessor.  Mark Knopfler remains one of the best guitarists out there, with a unique and easily identifiable style.  He has gone on to release several solo albums, but the group itself appears to be finished.      The lineup for the group on this album was:  Mark Knopfler (guitars and vocals), Alan Clark (keyboards), Guy Fletcher (keyboards and vocals), John Illsley (bass and vocals), Terry Williams (drums), and Omar Hakim (drums).  Almost all the drums are provided by Omar Hakim, but Terry Williams did the initial work and returned for the tour and videos.  There were a number of guest artists as well, including:  Jack Sonni (guitar), Michael Brecker (saxophone), Randy Brecker (horn), Malcolm Duncan (tenor saxophone), Neil Jason (bass), Tony Levin (bass), Michael Mainieri (vibraphone), Dave Plews (horn), and of course Sting (vocals on Money for Nothing).
014241039X|5.0|The Twits, by Roald Dahl is about a husband and wife that are extremely funny, yet not too smart. Mr. Twit is described with a big, burly beard with food stuck in it and Mrs. Twit is described as an old, ugly hag. Naturally, the Twits love to play mean tricks on each other, which always leads up to a good laugh. Throughout the book, tricks continue to go back and forth from Mr. and Mrs. Twit which in return keeps the story rolling along enjoyably. In the end, Mr. and Mrs. Twit find out that their pet monkeys plan to turn on their owners with a plan of tricks of their own. Overall, The Twits is another great book by Dahl with a moral that its what is on the inside that counts.
0307408833|3.0|Nice recipes, beautiful pics, but to be honest I was disappointed with the content. I was looking for sugar-free recipes, and found that only one of the recipes in this book was actually low on sugar - all other recipes call for heaps of agave. A more appropriate title description would have been \\"refined-sugar free\\". A good book for vegans though, and those who look for inspiring pictures and cute desserts when baking.
B0043EV774|5.0|First, this is probably the best version of Alice ever filmed.  The story is told in a manner that makes the characters seem more \\"real\\".  The acting is great.<br /><br />Now, let's get to the 3D.  With the exception of a few places in the opening sequences, before Alice goes down the rabbit hole, the 3D is great...almost equalling Avatar 3D.  When filmed against green screens and with a healthy dose of CGI, the realism of 3D is superb.  Why? because with those tools, depth of field can be controlled precisely.  There were scenes where I ducked when an object came my way. :-)  That brings me back to my reference to the early scenes which appeared a bit flat, in places.  This is primarily due to the limitations of optical lenses.  The wider the aperture, the more limited the depth of field...foreground and background cannot be kept in focus simultaneously.  When that happens, the 3D effect suffers.<br /><br />So why did I rate this 5 stars?  Simple, because the part of the film that its primary focus, was done superbly and was visually stunning.  Use the Wizard of Oz as a comparison.  Before Dorothy left Kansas, it wasn't so spectacular, but once she arrived in Oz.....Wow!  Same thing here.<br /><br />BTW, this was viewed on a Panasonic 54\\" 3D plasma TV.<br /><br />I should also point out that 8 days after I bought it, Amazon dropped the price $5.  That angers me.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Bought this CD as a Christmas gift for my mom.  When asked if she liked it, she said \\"Of course!  It's Josh Groban!\\"  Guess that says it all!  A co-worker bought it and liked it, as well.  Seems to be a must-have for anyone who likes Josh Groban!
B001YYQ9SS|1.0|I liked Final Fantasy - the Spirits Within.    This is not even close.    This is a sequel rip-off - kiddy cartoon crap.

B000022TSV|5.0|My God I was mezmerized with this operatic musical; refreshing that many of the lines are spoken and not sung --- I have always felt singing every line of dialogue does not add to the opera. Domingo is so convincing as the crazed-jealous and spurned lover; best acting and singing in this role I ever saw. And Migenes...she is a hottie with a voice and boy can she act. Some of the opera purists do not like this but I say you do have the best of all possible worlds. Buy this film (unfortunately VERY HIGH- close to $200 on Amazon.com since it is out-of-print) and buy your favorite staged performance. I have three Carmen's and they are wonderfully different experiences.
B003GCXU9M|5.0|From the first page where Hank is strolling around New Orleans, you knew you were in for one helluva ride.    Sometimes, Bukowski disguts me as a person. However, there is no denying the infinite sadness stemming from his childhood and the depths he goes to cover that sadness by his heavy drinking and wandering.    Factotum is for the everyman. And in some way, I think we all can relate somehow/someway to good 'ol Buk.
B000SMWUPS|2.0|I really liked this product.  It was working great on my Uppababy Vista, but it broke after about 6 months of use.  I don't fill it with much at all (usually just a water bottle or a cup of coffee and nothing else), so I'm not sure why it broke.  I really like the design of it, but I'm hesitant to buy another one because of the cheap strap.
B000002J03|5.0|Just the opening riff of Heartbreaker justifies the purchase of II alone. Wont retread other reviews but rather say that this music is far superior to hard rock of today. After turning this one up to 11 on the car stereo Tinnitus never sounded so good!!!!!! A great piece of rock.
B00169N0BK|4.0|I've owned this product for several weeks now. I have been trying to get it to work with my desktop computer. I have it connected to a 46\\" Samsung tv. I installed the software and created a profile, but I keep getting an error message \\"can not set the LUTS\\". I finally tracked down a solution on Xrites website, but their solution didn't work. So for the past few weeks now I have been chasing the problems to get this thing to work. Yesterday I finally decided I was going to return the product, but I wanted to make sure that it wasn't a problem with my computer first. So I installed the program on my laptop. I calibrated the screen and everything worked out just fine. So after seeing success on the laptop, I decided to reinstall the program on the desktop. I recalibrated the monitor and this time I did not get the \\"can not set the LUTS\\" error message. I thought to myself \\"success at last\\", but that was short lived. When I finally got out of the program and opened up a photo of a portrait I took, it looked like the people had an Incredible Hulk tan. So I doubled checked the colors against a pic of a 18% grey card and it was a mint green color. So the problem is obviously with the communication with the video card. I just don't see why it is having problems with the video card. Both the laptop and desktop are running ATI video cards and both are running the Catalyist Control Center. Both systems are Windows 7 and have AMD processors.  I will find out the answer to this problem even if I have to reinstall Windows 7 on my desktop.<br /><br />So far the product has been a hit and a miss. The colors on the laptop are wonderful. Too bad I never intended to use this product on the laptop. I don't do any editing on the laptop. Plus people like to see the pictures on a large screen, hench the 46\\" tv. I will try tommorrow to connect the tv to my laptop and calibrate it to see if I get the Hulk tan again. I will update this review with either a success or failure, and upon success I will give a solution.give a solution.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|I really enjoy this album.  I've had it for about a year now.  I think it's so creative and interesting.  The first time I heard it, I was (even more) impressed at how much ahead-of-his-time that David was.  If I didn't know any better, you could have told me it was from 2010, and I'd believe you.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Secretariat is a very enjoyable movie, about the horse, the family who owned it, and the men who road and trained it.  Like Seabiscuit, this movie is as much a story of the humans involved as it is about the horse.  Great acting, wonderful audio and visual effects, an upbeat soundtrack, and attention to the societal issues of the day highlight this fine film that's great for the whole family to watch together.
B00337KM2S|5.0|Ryan Bingham (George Clooney)  has carved out a life of weightlessness (almost).  He's an executive for an out-placement firm that is engaged when a company needs to get rid of large swatches of their employees.  He's pared down his existence to a single carry-on; so much so that he's beginning to carve out a side career teaching others how to shed their possessions, their obligations, even their relationships and loved ones.<br /><br />He lacks one of the key elements of what it is to be human.  He's almost estranged from his family, he has no wife, no kids, no pets, not even a houseplant.  He does have a good business relationship with his boss, his assistant, and that's pretty much it.  He is so detached that he doesn't even notice anything is missing.  But, things will soon happen that shake up his world.<br /><br />On first viewing, I admired the acting (especially Clooney), the set design, the lighting, the cinematography, and the sound.  The story itself was clever, but the movie watcher really knew what was going to happen.  Bingham was going to experience something (or someone) that would make him realize that his goal of being the seventh person to achieve the coveted 10 million mile status (the youngest to get there) paled in comparison to his startling lack of human involvement.  The movie was extremely well directed (by Jason Reitman) and well achieved, but curiously non-involving.  It's good, but it's not a film that will be taken down from the DVD shelf very often.<br /><br />It's only after watching the commentary with director Reitman that I really appreciated the craft of the movie.  This commentary is why DVD special features were invented.  Playing the movie with the commentary on added a whole other dimension to the film.  Reitman grew up on Hollywood, his dad produced the film (Ivan Reitman), and he has many, many stories to tell about the making of the film.  So many, in fact, that he hardly ever stops talking.  There are two other members of the crew on the commentary, but you seldom hear from them.  Reitman just won't let them get a word in.  He's good and very entertaining to listen to, but why even have the other guys there?  And yet, he is entertaining as hell.  What a great dinner companion he would be.  Once he got going, you'd just sit back and listen.<br /><br />I do have to also comment on the film's 'fired folks'.  Some of them are actors, but most of them are non-actors who were asked by Reitman to appear on camera and sort of relive their own firings.  These non-actors were very, very good, and certainly lent an air of authenticity to the film.  A stroke of brilliance to include these people.<br /><br />Three and a half stars for 'Up in the Air'.  Four-and-a-half for the DVD extras (there's also an interesting interview with the company that did the opening shot, and other aerials in the film).<br /><br />November 2015 update:  I've upped the rating to a full five stars.  The reason:  I have good memories of this film, and I've recommended ti to others, who have enjoyed it as well.  It's really a great melancholy film, with a nuanced portrayal of a 'lost' man in a harsh world.t you seldom hear from them.  Reitman just won't let them get a word in.

B002SSUQFG|1.0|This watch is self-winding only while being worn around the clock. If I wear it all day and take it off at night, it usually stops by 5:00 AM and needs to be reset in the morning, The watch has even stopped during the day when I have a day of leisure.
0385340990|5.0|Finally I found a book that swept me from my frantically busy life, and into a comfy chair. I gobbled it in one sitting, regretting at once that my beloved characters were gone and I hadn't cherished them properly. I read Guearnsey a couple of months ago and am still grieving the loss of each and every charmer in the novel. Especially I miss our whip smart spit your tea out funny heroine. Sure sure I could just read it again, and I will of course, but you can only experience that kind of magic once. Do yourself a favor and turn off your cell phone. Get a soft blanket and a cup of something, turn to page one and let the charm unfold. It will require nothing of you but a willingness to laugh explosively (I encourage swallowing your chosen beverage first if you have time). If you are disappointed by this book I'll eat my blanket.
0385341679|5.0|I have been waiting for this book for 2 years and Amazon had the best price even in hard back.  I got just what I wanted for a great price and it is a close 2nd to my favorite series only to be beaten by the Twilight series.  If you have not read the Fever series you are seriously missing out, they are great books a defiant must read. Thanks Amazon!       Mallknox3030
B004AKCME8|3.0|I've read the first three books with my 7 1/2 year old son.  He and I have really enjoyed the stories--page turners for us both.  But, we had very different reactions to the movie:  He loved the movie so much that he wanted to watch it again when it was over; I on the other hand found the adaptation VERY disappointing.  I thought the books are rich and multi-layered.  The movie was thin and confusing.  If you haven't read the books, I think the movie would be very hard to follow.  My son gave it 5 stars and I gave it one star, so I split the difference and gave it three stars.
B002JCSRKC|4.0|The Croc rain boot appears to be true to size. I ordered my usual size, and the width and length of the foot is perfect. The foot is not as wide as some of the Croc garden shoes, but still pretty wide. The shaft of the boot is just wide enough for me to tuck jeans in (my calf circumference is 15\\"). I mostly wear them in the backyard while taking care of the chickens, but wore them out about town the other day during a heavy rainstorm.  My feet stayed dry, and they were mostly very comfortable except  for one area at the front of my ankle/ top of my foot, where the foot of the boot meets the shaft, rubbed with each step, and it got uncomfortable throughout the day.  I'm going to try padding that area with some foam or moleskin. Overall I'm quite pleased with these, and they're way cuter than farm mucker boots.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|the movie can be desturbing with the raping and even eith an officer of the law joining in. In a way it showa you even the officers of the law can't be trusted. The lady takes the law in her own hands and get each guy back even though she ends up killing them in the end. two wrongs dosen't make a right, but the movie is good. You would hope someone would help if she would seek it. If you see it from her point of view and officer would be belived over her so in the long run justice wouldn't be done but by her. I bought this from amazon and it was fast shipping and great shape.
B003JSSPSY|4.0|While I didn't like the second season as much as the first, I still loved this program. The show was based on Terry Goodkind's books, although they didn't follow the book much, but the actors/actresses chosen to represent his characters are spot on. The quality is fantastic and I'm incredibly grateful that they didn't produce the show with some crummy budget. Even though things have changed for TV-- quite a lot at times-- I still think it's fantastic. :)
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|A lot of people think that this is regular old Evangelion all over again. No, no. This is the foundation for something new and godly. If you watched this and have already seen Eva, you will notice the differences.<br /><br />(Spoiler!) As we notice, many scenes have been altered, and it even shows that Kaoru, the fifth child, comes from the moon to face Shinji? Hm- and being as he was in contact with Seele, we can tell that this story is going an alternate route. Also! In the preview for 2.22 we see Minami, a character who's never been in Eva before this. So, there's that to consider.<br />(Spoiler ends!)<br /><br />Ahem, with that out of the way, we can now move on to the actual product! A lovely and shining slip cover that dons a fold out box- both being covered in amazing artwork. Within that we have 2 DVDs and a booklet. The book is filled with random factoids and whatnot, nothing spectacular. The main DVD is the movie, of course, and the second is all special features. The special features are rather... lackluster? Though, it's nice to just add in stuff for no real extra price.<br /><br />The main thing to concern yourself with is 1.01. Do not buy that. For about the same price you can have the newer, better looking, and more jam-packed version with a slightly uglier box. Hah. (I prefer the art on the 1.01 box. No matter as I have both.)<br /><br />The movie is great, same old storytelling as always. A good bit of re-cap if you have already seen Eva, with the added twist of some new story. Eva feels brand new when watching 1.11, to me. Fresh visuals, amazing story and whatnot, action, drama- regardless of how many times I see Eva, it still remains timeless. There are many scenes which have gone complete overhauls where new graphic were added, 3D rendering is utilized and even fresh vocals and amazing sound to boot!<br /><br />So, to sum it all up; this version looks great (Better than 1.01), sounds amazing, has some extras, is a slightly altered re-telling of some of the Eva story which is in part of a seemingly new plot, and dons a shiny box.a seemingly new plot, and dons a shiny box.

1596434252|5.0|Every person I have shown this book to agrees it is simply amazing. so simple in its execution, the alphabet and yet so playful and surprising it makes you feel young again! the books design doesn't lend itself well to being used as a Childs educational tool as the designs are complex, intricate and fragile. Personally I don't think its intended use is to educate a child in the alphabet but simply to amaze the viewer as the letters unfold, reveal, spring up and delight as each page is turned. to own this is to own a work of art
B00005K9LM|4.0|This album is an original Judas Priest album. Heavy metal at all. It has very good songs (Love bites is my favorite). In some tracks there are some small solos but they are all really good. This is one of Judas Priests best albums (Its not like Painkiller and Sad wings of destiny ) but follows very well . A must for Judas Priest fans.
1570629706|4.0|Bouncing from situation to situation Siddhartha was not satisfied with his findings.  He first became a part of the Brahmin culture and then progressed to locate the teachings of the omnipotent Buddha.  Of course, his questions still lingered.  Of course his hunt continued.  In his last Stanza he crossed paths with a female friend who conceived his off spring.  Siddhartha learned that not all of life's questions are meant to be answered.  It's what is involved in the problem that directs you to the answer.  The answer is always in front of you, but like Siddhartha you never realize it until it is all said and done.<br /><br />  Siddhartha had a quest to find inner piece, to discover the meaning of his life.  He had knowledge to venture a notable journey, but he realized wisdom does not coincide with knowledge.  Wisdom is what Siddhartha obtained after he saw the world from his new normal neutral perspective.  He matured through his voyage to see through a lens we all wish we could see through.  Knowledge is power, but wisdom controls what you know.  Siddhartha centered his innovative wisdom to see the knowledge of the world that was in front of him.
B00005Y0S4|2.0|This album may be the worst album Judas Priest have ever released. Its so terrible that there is not any good song so you can say its just ok. Sorry guys but this album is only for collectors. I really wonder how some guys like this album. They are probably very fanatic fans (means whatever Judas Priset releash they are gonna like it). It reminds me of Metallica -> there are guys that they like St anger (if you believe this). IF you are new to Judas Priest try Painkiller and some previous works like Sad wings of Destiny - British steel and Defenders of the faith.
B000JQUZCI|1.0|I got the free Kindle edition from the link on the page for the Norton Critical Edition of the 1818 text. Mary Shelley made many significant edits to the book for the 1831 edition. I assumed it was the same edition because the link was from the same page. I didn't realize it was different until I went to write my assigned essay and went online to search for page numbers for the passages I wanted to quote. Many of the quotes I wanted to use don't even appear in the original version. This is a very important distinction, and I wish it had been labeled correctly so I would not have had to waste so much time looking for online versions of the correct text in order to replace the quotes I could not use from the later version. This edition is fine if you just want to read the book, but if you're reading it for school, you have more than likely been assigned the 1818 version, which is very different. The Kindle edition is also lacking in any kind of Kindle formatting, making it a hassle to find locations in the book.

0553381687|5.0|I had picked this book up on whim wanting to know what this new series was about and not expecting too much considering how infrequently I stray from nonfiction, let alone into fantasy novels.  What I found, though, was everything I could ever want in any kind of fictional work: betrayal and secrecy, warfare and passion, cynicism and idealism, mystery and beauty.  Mr. Martin's writing is superb, his characterizations flawless, and his stories engrossing.  To think that so much was fit into a novel of less than 700 pages blows the mind.  And yet, there are three more that have already been written afterwards with 3 more yet to come!  I look forward to reading more about the Starks and Lannisters, about Daenrys Targaryen as she continues to transform from chapter to chapter, and of the Night Watch as they face the true evil that threatens to destroy their world.  I will say, though, that this is not an easy book to follow.  The structure of the novel, switching between characters in the third person limited while other key plot points are happening simultaneously, can get confusing, especially if you put the book down for a day or two.  But, every fan of epic literature owes to himself/herself to pick up this book before the HBO series airs in April.

Season 2 brought the show into focus and streamlined the \\"over here\\" / \\"over there\\" concept, which season 3 is making great use of in alternating episodes. The downside, however, is that the \\"over there\\" team is far less interesting, and without the quirky charm and dark humor of the Walter / Peter/ Astrid pairing, those episodes really seem to drag for me. Anna Torv's acting has improved since the show's inception, but I still prefer the original ensemble episodes and hope the writers start giving the supporting cast more to do again.    Also, I want to address the complaints about quality and failed downloads... I've never had any problems with Unbox, and have used it for multiple TV series. The quality really does seem to be better than iTunes, and the download speeds comparable if not greater. If it doesn't work for you, I would highly recommend checking your proxy settings and using the \\"troubleshoot\\" option built-in.
0670022411|5.0|I adore this book. I love supernatual books and this one did not disappoint! Before reading though you should be warned, it is extremely detailed, which some might say slows the plot down, I personally thought it really gave me a feel for the story and made it that much more believable. Also, this book is written by history professor and that is obvious. It gives an in depth look at academia during the first half of the book. But I loved all the historical elements. She's also a wine lover and that is also obvious. I honestly had to use the dictionary function on my kindle often while reading this book, but I was glad to finally read a story about witches and vampires that was intelligent. One last warning, the story is not neatly wrapped up at the end of this book. This is supposedly the first book of a trilogy, so don't expect a sense of closure. It's such a good read though, I didn't mind.

0061726826|5.0|*Sigh* and yes, I start with a sigh because even though I read this book a couple of months ago I still don't have the right words to explain how I feel about it. Saying I love it does not even begin to describe how much I really do. I knew that when I first heard about Delirium I would do everything possible to get my hands on it and read it as soon as I could and I was sooo glad I did. This book was amazing, I loved Lauren's debut novel Before I Fall and I just knew this one was going to be just as great, but I was wrong because Delirium was even better, it was epic.<br /><br />I couldn't find a single flaw in this beautiful story. I loved that the beginning focuses on world building and getting you acquainted with the characters and the way they live their lives, it helps you understand how the world has changed and how they treat love as a disease. I just loved the world that Lauren created in this story, it wasn't lacking in details and it made perfect sense to me, it didn't leave me confused about the purpose of this society and the way it works. Yes of course it was insane the way this people acted around each other without any kind of real feeling or emotion, more like robots or zombies, I felt very frustrated and angry at times but I loved every minute I spent reading about it.<br /><br />The main characters were well developed and beautifully written, they weren't perfect but had realistic flaws that helped me feel a connection to them and the emotional turmoil that they go through. Hana, Lena's friend was my favorite one, I loved Lena and Alex of course but I feel a little bit thankful to Hana for being the wild one between the two, and not being afraid to take some risks before the cure, which in some way ends up changing Lena's life and her beliefs about LOVE.<br /><br />I really loved the little snippets from the Book of Shhh at the beginning of each chapter, it's suppose to be the book that this society goes by and their beliefs and rules, so it was helpful to me to understand a little bit better what these people really think about love and how it can kill you. Insane as it all sounded I have to admit that  it kind of made a little sense that they wanted to protect themselves from it, but even if it did, I would never want to live in a world without it.<br /><br />Lauren keeps increasing the intensity in the story while throwing a few shocking twists that make you hold your breath and wondering how it will all turn up in the end. By the time I finished the book I was sobbing and clutching it tightly to my chest, which is a true sign of how immersed I was into the story that it left me raw and emotional. I remember thinking while reading it that I finally found the next series that will fill the void left behind from The Hunger Games series. Lauren Oliver's writing in Delirium is brilliant and moving, it will demand your full attention and you won't want to let it go. You'll feel like you're falling in love for the first time all over again. Beautiful and definitely recommended!stand a little bit better what these people really think about love and how it can kill you.

I was actually very excited that this story was more fast paced and suspenseful. I really enjoyed Linger, a lot, especially with the new characters introduced and being in 4 different point of views through the book. Looking forward to \\"Forever\\".

B00005Y23E|5.0|I read something years ago and amazingly it still remains true 15 years later.  In any genre, Bob Marley, alone, has the highest sales percentage of any reggae performer or group.  He alone has captured more than 75% of reggae music sales.  Astounding.<br /><br />I dread compilation albums for many reasons.  Few have included all of what should be chronicled.  If not, it is supposed to give a broad overview of an artist's work.  Legend, in my opinion, accomplishes the latter.<br /><br />He recorded for nearly 20 years, with his groundbreaking Island catalog coming in 1970 with the release of Catch A Fire and ending in 1980 with Uprising.  (Although, Confrontation was in the works at his death.)  Legend came out in 1984 and has remained the defining moment among reggae lovers since.<br /><br />His calypso and ska days won't be found here and in truth, many renditions of the tracks on Legend are equaled or surpassed on other albums or black-market releases such as his 1975 concert at The Quiet Nights Club in Chicago.  That was breathtaking.  Or his last live recording in Japan.  (Although, his TDK studio recording of Catch A Fire in Toyko (1970-71) is outstanding as well.) What you have here is moments of greatness.  Period.<br /><br />I've owned the original album when it was released in 1982 and have always treasured it.<br /><br />A few years ago, Island/Polygram came out with Legend 2 which was a weak attempt to do an unnecessary follow up.<br /><br />LEGEND, The Deluxe edition contains the entire single disc of Legend as well as the Jamaican and extended version of these studio songs.  It is a great sampler of what Bob Marley, Bob Marley and the (original)Wailers, Bob Marley and the (post Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh)Wailers were about.<br /><br />I love this album tremendously.<br /><br />Having own quite a few of his blackmarket/ underground concerts none of the official \\"live\\" recording of the Wailers stacks up against the ones that are privately owned and circulated, but there is the sense in listening to the few live tracks on this album of what a Bob Marley & The Wailers concert meant.<br /><br />This is a phenomenal album and the benchmark of what reggae was and what reggae should have always been.<br /><br />5 gargantuan stars.<br /><br />This is album #1 of my Top 100 Reggae Albums of all time.ted, but there is the sense in listening to the few live tracks on this album of what a Bob Marley & The Wailers concert meant.<br /><br />This is a phenomenal album and the benchmark of what reggae was and what reggae should have always been.<br /><br />5 gargantuan stars.<br /><br />This is album #1 of my Top 100 Reggae Albums of all time.

This is how the story goes: Dr. Martin Harris awakens after a car accident in Berlin to discover that his wife suddenly doesn't recognize him and another man has assumed his identity. Ignored by disbelieving authorities and hunted by mysterious assassins, he finds himself alone, tired and on the run. Aided by an unlikely ally, Martin plunges headlong into a deadly mystery that will force him to question his sanity, his identity, and just how far he's willing to go to uncover the truth.    The cast led by Liam Neeson (as Martin Harris) is great! The directing by Jaume Collet-Serra (who also directed \\"House Of Wax\\" (2005) & \\"Orphan\\" (2009) is great!

Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Natalie Dormer, and Henry Cavill were especially wonderful \\"in their characters.\\"  The final episode of the series was one of the most beautiful AND sad things we've ever watched on television.

The action and special effects were great and the story wasn't bad, it kept me engaged. Was it great? maybe not but I liked it all the same and look forward to the next one.

MJ was unusual even back then, in a good way. Will leave it at that :)

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Think of it this way - almost ALL pop music you may listen to, was written and recorded AFTER this album was made ... pretty incredible no ?    When looked at from that perspective, it is easy to see why so many people consider The Beatles the greatest rock'n'roll band ever. They are up there with Elvis, who gave us rock'n'roll when he recorded that old Blues tune That's Allright Mama.    yes the boomers had it all ... and it's still there for us today !
B003BW0CB6|5.0|After having finally gone through the entire Connelly fiction catalog, I approached this book with a bit of hesitation. First, it has recieved somewhat mixed reviews here on Amazon and, secondly, it was the last book until April of 2011 for me to read of Connelly's. If you are having any of those issues (or any other for that matter) put them to rest. This is a very good book and, for those that have read a number of Connelly's others, a true reunion of sorts.<br /><br />The title says it all in this book. Mickey Haller, step brother to the one and only Harry Bosch gets his nightmare assignment by temporarily stepping over to the prosecution's side of the court room to prosecute a sadistic child killer recently released due to new DNA results in his conviction. This is the toughest issue you need to buy into in order to enjoy this book. I am no lawyer and I do find this idea far fetched. I cannot imagine that too many DA's offices around the country would temporarily assign someone from outside of their office to handle a prosecution. Further, to assign a successful career defense lawyer to the job seems downright silly. However, Connelly does a good job of selling the idea. The DA's office has been tainted by it's first trial against this defendant. In the public's eye, none of them can be trusted. The concept of hiring a temporary independent lawyer that is beyond reproach actually makes sense. I doubt that it is possible in reality but it stands up to the logic test. Further, this is a book after all, and why not take some liberties for the sake of entertainment?<br /><br />Beyond The Reversal itself, this book is really a blast. Harry Bosch, back working with his step brother to reinvestigate the killer. Rachel Walling (FBI, former Bosch love interest) comes in for a much needed new profile of the killer. Even &#34;Sticks&#34;, Mickey's point man in the media is here. Connelly does a borderline brilliant job of mixing Mickey's and Harry's back stories. While we dont have the same character depth with Mickey that we do with Harry, Connelly does a very nice job of further telling his defense attorney's story.<br /><br />The bottom line is this; if you are a Connelly / Bosch fan, you have to read this book. I highly recommend reading all (at least some) of the books that were written prior to this. At the very least read the following; The Lincoln Lawyer, The Brass Verdict, The Poet, A Darkness More Than Night, The Narrows and The Brass Verdict. While I would highly recommend them all, this smaller list should give you the background you need to thoroughly enjoy this great book.haracter depth with Mickey that we do with Harry, Connelly does a very nice job of further telling his defense attorney's story.

0823015033|5.0|I've been sculpting for a long time now, but I never had a technical base from which to begin working. Okay, so not all of us want, or need to. But I prefered to. I've never really liked having to feel out the beginings of my work. This book here gave me a technical grounding which sped up my work and built the base from which I could create whatever end look I was going for. It would also be perfect for the beginner as you are shown the most simplist way to create completely convincing work. It couldn't be easier and that is the real key with this book - everything is made so simple and the end results are stunning.
B0046UGSNS|3.0|Between the sparkling reviews and the cast, I expected something a lot more substantial.    The story line is promising -- what happens when kids seek out their \\"biological father\\" sperm donor and this disrupts a family's lives? -- but the movie doesn't deliver on its potential. Instead, it meanders, taking a lengthy look at this family with little real purpose besides a few soap opera moments interspersed with a lot of tedious daily life (along with some supporting characters who are so one-dimensional as to be all but pointless.) A better script might have helped.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|For the past ten days I've been living in Joss Whedon's universe. It all started with a copy of the series Firefly.  Wow, what a great show! I'd never seen it before and can only add my vote to those who morn its demise. I was expecting the movie Serenity to be just as amazing, but unfortunately I was disappointed. Serenity lacked the warmth and humor of Firefly, and I couldn't feel the bond between the characters so evident in the series. Sorry, but for me Serenity is a cold, overly violent and forgettable B movie. After Firefly I was ready to join the Browncoats. Now I feel more like an Alliance mole.
0143114085|1.0|I liked this book enough to order several more by Sophie Hannah.  But they became not worth reading.  The characters were all less than normal and mostly unlikeable. The plots were contrived and slow moving.  She is not in the category of Reginald Hill or Ruth Rendell or Robert Goddard, or Peter Robinson et.al.  This was a great disappointment and will teach me not to order sequels en masse.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|I am not sure why there are so many bad reviews on this film, but I think it is one of the most scariest and greatest of them all. To me, it is right up there with the Exorcist. And that is scary. I am a huge horror movie freak. None of them make me scared, but this made me pretty jumpy and shaky at the end of the film. I even had nightmares! Some people say it is slow moving. The second one was slow moving. Not this one. Like a normal horror movie, things were mild at the beginning. Door moving and some thudding noises but as each night went by, things got extreme after the boyfriend got the ouija board things started getting worse. Door slamming shut suddenly, the hall light would turn on for a few minutes then turn off. Un human demonic footprints appear in the powder they leave down one night. At some point a huge noise was heard from downtstairs and at that scene if you REALLY listen carefully, you can hear this slight distant groaning sound that sounds like Regan from The Exorcist. Then it got to the point when the girl was possessed by the demon. The ending was most likely the most scariest part. The girl (Katie). Katie stabbed herself with a small black cross. The boyfriend planned on them leaving but Katie refused saying it will be ok. By night, Katie gets up and stares at her boyfriend as he sleeps for 2 hours. Then she goes down stairs. You cannot see what is happening downstairs since it is recorded. But all of a sudden a loud blood curdling scream hit. That scream was so loud that I remember saying \\"What the heck is happing?!\\" over and over. And he ran down and you could hear a struggle when finally it went dead silent. Like as if you lost volume. Then you heard footsteps and suddenly the boyfriend's body was slammed up against the camera and Katie smiled demonicaly at the camarea and it went to black.   I think whoever doesn't get scared by this or thinks it is stupid or fake, is a real dead head. They aren't talking ghosts in this. They are talking demons. A real thing. I HIGHLY recomand buying this if you want to get scared. It is SO worth the money!!!!

B003EV6DBM|5.0|I am a newcomer to this show, having watched a few episodes in the past but never following the show with the religious fervor that long-time fans adhere to. However, I have gone back and watched all of the new seasons and was only mildly impressed with David Tenant's performance as the Doctor. But, from the opening of this series- the 11th incarnation of the Doctor flying over London with a malfunctioning TARDIS- Matt Smith brought something to the role that I had been waiting for. Smith brings a boyish charm and wonderful comedic timing to even the darkest episodes of the 5th series- especially \\"The Time of Angels\\"! Along with his new companion, Amy Pond, and an appearance or two by Dr. Song, and the excellent writing (mainly Steven Moffat, who wrote 6 of the 13 episodes) Dr. Who continues to dish out laughter and scares in the latest season of one of the greatest shows ever created.
0385335482|2.0|After finish reading this book, I have a hard time understanding why it is so highly rated.  The book is an easy read, and funny at times. However, the main character was so poorly constructed that she appeared dillusional and stupid. What bothered me the most was that she lied almost all the time! There was no transition from the shopaholic Rebecca to the... sort of put together Rebecca(she's definitely not recovered)at the end.  Even her romance seemed abrupt, I couldn't feel any chemistry there. I am so disappointed, I am not going to read any other books in the series.
B0030Y11XS|2.0|I've just finished watching Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story, and have to admit that I found it to be a confusing and frustrating attempt to attack the notion of capitalism. Additionally, I found the filmmaking to be poor, as there really is no central narrative and Moore presents his case, which is difficult to actually piece together, in the form of semi-related instances with little to no background explanation.    My biggest problem with the film is that it is not about capitalism. In fact, the entire film can be viewed as an argument FOR capitalism, as every example that Moore reports on can be traced to the American government's intervention in the free market. Similarly, the social issues he bemoans usually come as results of free market inhibitions, NOT the markets themselves. For example, Moore's two biggest cases against \\"capitalism\\" are the absurdly low wages of airline pilots and the government bailout of Wall Street in 2008, but airlines are one of the most heavily regulated industries in America, and a government bailout of the private sector is the exact opposite of capitalism. In a capitalist system, the market itself would determine pilot wages, and the banks involved in the crash would have collapsed.     These are just a couple of examples, but that notion is present in almost everything Moore does. He uses shock value and popular examples of disparity to engender an emotional response, but these scenes usually allow for viewers to draw conclusions that are not only contradictory to Moore's central charge against capitalism, but are oftentimes contradictory to one another.     Moreover, he makes several absurd claims without any explanation or back-up. At one point, he actually says, \\"capitalism is an evil,\\" not long after he makes a claim supporting the post-WWII German government's prescription that, in times of need, the state can seize the means of production and command the economy. First of all, that would be a nightmare. Secondly, though, this heavy support for government intervention in the markets is directly at odds with his condemnation of the Wall St bailouts. It just doesn't make any sense.    In the end, he throws in some videos of Obama rallies, and closes with Hurricane Katrina. There doesn't seem to be any reason for the Katrina footage, other than to make the claim that \\"it's never the Wall Street bankers that this happens to.\\" The movie just devolves into a cluttered mess, from which it is nearly impossible to draw any meaningful conclusion.     I gave it two stars for the humor value. Moore gets some laugh for parading around Wall St with a money sack like an idiot, demanding billions of dollars, and then cordoning off the area as a crime scene. It's humorous, but certainly not enlightening, educational, or justified.

But, it is a standalone collection of animated films and it should be enjoyable, regardless!

B001TMCBI2|5.0|I actually ran across something very similar in an article in Life magazine back in the late seventies. The article was by a doctor who cured himself of cancer through diet. The diet was extremely close to the Gerson Therapy. There is no doubt that proper diet would prevent or at least put off terminal illnesses for decades. I have a pretty healthy family tree so I am not a poster child for anything out of the ordinary but I have enjoyed a happy and productive life following a much looser version of this diet. Now I was welder, a machinist, a painter, a Ford factory employee so environmentally my body has had it rough but I am still the picture of health. Lungs, heart, joints, all working fine at 54.    I like wild caught seafood, only eat organic meats (poultry), 95% of my diet is vegetarian, very little animal protein sources. In the last 10 years I have bought everything I could that was organic, not just for myself but for sustainable farming methods that won't ruin the environment. NO GMO (genetically modified organisms).   Do yourself a favor and start changing your diet now. It is one of the hardest things to do and may take decades. What you habitually stick in your mouth is extremely hard to change. If you have a terminal illness then you have no time to waste and plenty of incentive.    Of course the ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure is true but I would make it more like an ounce of prevention is worth two ounces of cure since the majority of people on the Gerson diet will benefit greatly whether fighting a chronic illness or looking for a better quality of life.
B0043GAZYS|1.0|After watching the first 5 minutes of this movie, I was blown away by how utterly terrible it is. We wanted to turn it off and just watch TV but we decided to stick it out. Bad choice. The movie didn't get any better. It just kept going down this slope of stupidity. I swear whoever made the movie was on acid the whole time. We watched it on bluray, the picture was very grainy and disappointing. Will not watch ever again.

Granted the whole idea of the Long Walk is hardly King's style, it's a great \\"noir\\" concept - 100 boys under 16 take part in a competition - one wins, the 99 get killed. And from the start up until 2/3 of the book the writing is typical SK - small Americana stories from the past intertwine with the ongoing story that would keep you reading (imho). But the last third of the book is the most sloppy writing I have ever read, period. After building up a good story, King all of a sudden rushes through the last part, leaving many questions unanswered, many stories untold and the main characters' deaths lack any emotion and are told in just a couple of sentences. In a nutshell, one can read about 2/3 of this book and just put it down and move on, without missing anything. A real shame as the build-up is great, but there is no \\"pop\\" towards the end.    I honestly can't say if I would or would not recommend this book...But if given the choice, I would much rather NOT read this book than read it and be left with all those question marks and plot holes.

B002BU0DPE|4.0|I bought these headphones for my son for his birthday.  His PS3 is connected to a receiver using HDMI; therefore, we use a receiver and their associates speakers for sound.      The instructions were a little fuzzy but we were able to hook up the headphones through the old PS connector and going into the PS3 set up to allow both hdmi and PS connector to be active. The advantage is that you hear the game sound through the speaker without speech (which you hear in the headphones) which is good when more than one player is playing the PS3. It will require an older PS2/3 cable that doesn't come with the headphones (we had a couple laying around from old PS2 systems).    The headphones are not \\"kid proof\\" and need to be treated accordingly... or you will break them at the swivel of the ear piece.    Oh... they sound great.  Solid product and my son really loves them.
B001NP8PQW|5.0|Can't really say anything more than this is an absolutely spectacular Blu-Ray.  Doesn't seem to be shot in true 1080, but it's as good as 720 gets.  The sound is awesome, Smith's vocals are crisp and clean, you can pick out every word.  The bottom end is substantial and weighty.  I'm playing \\"Plainsong\\" over and over, louder each time, and burning speaker fuses like crazy, I've gone through two five packs already because of this disc.    If you like Disintegration, it is a real treat to see these songs live.  A must for anybody who enjoys the Cure.  There are no disappointments on this disc.
B002NUULNG|3.0|There's nothing compelling here, neither for old fans of the movie, nor for people who've never seen it.    For old fans: All they've done to \\"update\\" the movie is replace a few scenes with ReBoot-quality CGI animation.  Most of these updates focus on Major Kusanagi's breasts.  If you're not a 12-year-old boy, you may not find much benefit here.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the original version carefully balanced CGI and hand-drawn animation.  This version chucks that out the window.  Fortunately, the original version is on this disk, under the Bonus Features.  Though it doesn't seem to have been cleaned up, it's still the superior version.    For people who've never seen it: I first watched it about 15 years ago.  The dialog hasn't gotten any less stilted in all that time.  Both the screenplay (which is less \\"dialog\\" and more \\"people talking near each other\\") and the flat line readings from the actors (which, unfortunately seems to be representative of too much anime) make it hard to invest fully in the characters.  The animation is beautiful, and the story is interesting.  But if you don't have a compelling reason to watch it, you might find it hard to stay invested.    K
B000JIHP88|5.0|I bought this for our infant twin great-grandsons, and it's a winner with both the babies and the parents.  The parents appreciate the music choices, and the babies are entranced with the figures and the movement of the mobile.  I'm going to buy this for another newborn in the family.  From my own experience with our babies and our grandchildren, I knew that Fisher Price would make a quality item and that this particular mobile would keep the babies' attention.
B00028HBKC|1.0|I ordered this movie and received it.  It was not in English, actually it was in Aramaic.  I returned this item and was told if I replaced it instead of getting a refund, they could not assure me that the new one would be in Engllish.  The language was not shown anywhere in the description.  They said they usually come in English but if they are out of it in English, they send whatever they have.  THIS SEEMS LIKE A TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE PRACTICE TO ME!  I asked for a refund and not only did they deduct the return shipping from my credit but they also deducted the shipping to me which I had already paid for.

1936041928|3.0|Many things about this play are fantastical: its compressed timeframe, the plot-moving presence of so many monsters and spirits, the mystical island location, and Prospero's status as both an abused hero and a slave-driving villain. Without the fantastical elements, the plot begs disbelief, as several emotionally strong and contradictory events take place within a single afternoon: Prospero carries out his years-in-the-making revenge fantasy yet also pardons his betrayers and gives up his magic; Sebastian both forms and then gives up his plan to murder his brother the king. Of course there is a happy ending involving a marriage and escape from exile, demonstrating that while \\"The rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance,\\" virtue wins out in the end.

The 'limited lifetime warranty' stated you can return it to have it replaced but you have to pay for it's S&H to be sent to get fixed/replaced as well as the S&H back of $8. Pointless warranty as you will be spending practically the same amount if you just bought a new one. I guess you get what you pay for.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|World War Z is written in a first-person interview format. A very clever way to tell a Zombie story. The interviewer travels around the world talking to individual citizens, government people, military leaders. The story is engrossing.

B004G600A4|5.0|Disney's latest addition to the world of animated full-length features is a joy through and through.  I have to admit that I had heard so many positive things about Tangled before I saw it that I started to doubt whether it could be all that good.  As a result, I found my expectations lowering, and I went into the show with a critical eye.  What I found surprised me.  It was THAT good!<br /><br />The villian in this show is worthy of being grouped with Disney's best.  She is conniving, despicable, manipulating, and, well, evil...all to meet her own personal needs.<br /><br />The stroryline, characters, and their interactions were top-notch through and through.  I have to admit that one of my favorite character-character interactions was between Flynn Rider and the horse Maximus...you'll see.<br /><br />It was soon obvious that Tangled works at multiple levels: small children, tweenagers, teens, and adults.<br /><br />I happened to see the film in a theater that was completely packed (and in 3D).  When the movie ended there was actually applause.  The crowd liked it that well.<br /><br />I noted that John Lasseter (of Pixar) was the executive producer, but Disney pulled this off on their own...it wasn't a Pixar flick, though it's as good as Pixar releases.<br /><br />I look forward to the DVD release of this film, since it will certainly be joining my video library.<br /><br />5 stars

0199538115|5.0|\\"Little Women\\", written by Louisa May Alcott, is about four sisters, Jo March who is fifteen-years-old, Meg March who is the oldest, Beth March who is thirteen-years-old, and Amy March who is the youngest by twelve-years-old, who live in England with their mother, Marmee. They are poor, and their mother mostly does the working, while their father is out fighting in war, but help out by working little jobs outside of helping in the house. The four sisters go through so much in life, but they don't care much about what others think because they are happy that they were blessed with a father and a mother who love them very much, and they always got each other.            \\"Little Women\\" is an amazing book that I recommend to anyone. It teaches people a life lesson, and shows how a person with less fortune lives throughout their lives. As I read this book, so many emotions went through my head, I found myself crying, happy, and wanting to read the book continuously without stopping. This book was originally written in 1868, it being the first novel book that she has ever written. Louis May Alcott was born in the year of 1832 in Massachusetts. She was the second daughter to Bronson Alcott and Abigail May. She had three sisters, Anna, Elizabeth, and Abby. When Louisa was about ten years, her and her family moved to Harvard, Massachusetts. On a hillside farm they planned to establish a model community, Fruitlands, making use of no animal products or labor except, as Abigail Alcott observed, for that of women. She and her small daughters struggled to keep household and farm going while the men went about the countryside philosophizing. In a few months quarrels erupted, and winter weather saw the end of the experiment. The only lasting product of Fruitlands was Louisa's reminiscence, \\"Transcendental Wild Oats.\\" Her and her family moved to Concord and for the next three years lived across the road from Emerson in a house they called Hillside, a relatively happy period preserved in the first chapters of Little Women. Closeness to the Emerson family was important to Louisa. Her first book, Flower Fables, 1854, was written for Ellen Emerson, whose father she idolized. Years later Alcott told Emerson about her early romance. \\"He was much amused,\\" she wrote, \\"and begged for his letters, kindly saying he felt honored to be so worshipped. The letters were burnt long ago, but Emerson remained my 'Master,' while he lived, doing more for me,--as for many another--than he knew, by the simple beauty of his life, the truth and wisdom of his books, the example of a great, good man.\\" In these years, Louisa \\"got religion,\\" as she later put it. Running in the Concord woods early one fall morning, she stopped to see the sunshine over the meadows. \\"A very strange and solemn feeling came over me as I stood there,\\" she wrote in her journal, \\"with no sound but the rustle of the pines, no one near me, and the sun so glorious, as for me alone. It seemed as if I felt God as I never did before, and I prayed in my heart that I might keep that happy sense of nearness all my life\\" (Louis May Alcott). On March 1, 1888, Louisa visited her father for the last time. \\"I am going up,\\" he said. \\"Come with me.\\" \\"Oh, I wish I could,\\" she replied. Bronson Alcott died on March 4, and Louisa May Alcott on March 6. She was buried in Sleepy Hollow cemetery in Concord. Her grave bears a Civil War veteran's marker. Throughout her life, she was successful, writing books about inspirational families and people. She was a great person in general as well, leaving a great memory of a wonderful woman who was loving and caring

Before I could buy another copy for her she called me and said to continue to enjoy and consider the book as a gift from her as she had just bought a copy for herself.  I was thrilled.  I'm now through it for the 3rd time.<br />I went [...] and gifted 3 copies to my adult children to continue to \\"pay it forward\\".<br />I'm impressed with the down to earth simplicity Rhonda was able to relay in this little \\"gem\\" of a book.

B0043UGKAM|1.0|This series was recommended to me by a friend of a friend.   I'm a big fan of action and violence, but I couldn't make it 10 minutes before quitting this show.   The dialogue was laughable; the costumes ridiculous (what the heck was Spartacus (almost) wearing?);  the (massive amounts of) fake blood splatter looked cheesy, and detracted from what otherwise may have been some decent action.    Maybe it gets better after minute 10, but I'll never know.    Not recommended.
B000002HMH|2.0|First off, I will say that this album has improved with age. When it was new, I really didn't know what to think. OK, I knew what to think:  I hated it.  However, I saw what Metallica was trying to do--something different--but in my opinion they just didn't do that \\"something different\\" very well.<br /><br />In retrospect after 15 years, I've become (slightly) more fond of this album. Nowadays, the main issue I see with this album is its length. The album itself is waaaaay too long (they should have trimmed a few weaker songs out of it, namely 'Cure', 'Poor Twisted Me', 'Wasted my Hate', '2x4'). Also, a few of the songs themselves drag on beyond what they can sustain without becoming boring. In short, the album needed better editing. They were experimenting with a new sound. They should have gone for tighter songs until they perfected this new sound. Why drag out simple songs in a new style for 6 or 9 minutes? OK sure, do that in rehearsals when you are working out the kinks, but in the finished product? This is more a fault of the producer than the band - a good producer knows when to give a band freedom and when to reign it in. Much of the time I can't get thru the songs. Around 3-4 mins the songs get repetitive and I track ahead. The songs themselves are not bad, it's just that many of them don't have enough momentum to successfully carry them past the 4 minute mark...<br /><br />Unlike many reviewers here, I really don't see this as a \\"sell out\\". It was a calculated gamble to move in a new direction; a gamble that didn't pay off. I also do not hear a whole lot of grunge or blues in these songs. Other than a couple country chords on 'Mama Said' and some bluesy moments at the end of 'Ronnie', it's mainly Metallica applying its signature metal sound to rock. In the end, it's an OK hard rock album with some decent songs, but it needed more critical editing to save it from itself....

B000002HRE|1.0|...since it seems to be full of songs not quite good enough for 'Load'.  There are a couple of OK songs (concert favorites \\"Fuel\\", \\"Memory Remains\\").  But these are not great songs by any means; they are simply middle-of-the-road hard rock songs.    The rest of ReLoad is quite boring and plagued by all of the problems of its predecessor 'Load'.  However it contains none of the few positives that are found on that album.  Even though I strongly disliked 'Load' at first, a couple songs eventually grew on me, but nothing on this sub-par sequel has any hope of doing so.    As a long time Metallica fan, I took a chance and bought this disc to give it a serious listen and give it a chance.  Not worth it.    In terms of studio albums, this is Metallica's low-point, by far.  Can only award 1 star.

B0035YDM9E|5.0|At this point, I have read so much about the breakdown of the global financial system that started in this country in 2007 and hit the fan in 2008 and that we are still recovering from.  I have read books, magazines, newspapers, and internet articles from all over the spectrum about the causes and consequences.  Some are better than others.  Matt Taibbi and Nomi Prins are compelling writers in their books, but they bring too much animus to their analysis.  Freefall, while not a breezy read, shows the overall competency of the author (They gave him a Nobel, but those in Economics are handed out like candy).<br /><br />Stiglitz brings to the issue the full force of his intellect, and he does his research: a quarter of the book is end-notes.  I'm not going to give him a prize for that, but what he deserves a prize for is his relatively objective, sober analysis of the crash, whatever it will be called in history books (I realize that it is hard to be objective in a politicized discourse such as macroeconomics, but since I agree with him more than I disagree, I will allow myself to call it objective).<br /><br />While the work is fairly exhaustive, I will not praise him point-by-point.  He can be a bit 'wonky' at times, but if you are briefed in the subject, you should be just fine as a general-interest reader.  The key thing here is that he looks at the failure to have a structural plan.  In the text, written in 2009, he warned about muddling through politically -- not having a plan would hurt both the party in power and the economy as a whole.  In the additional matter prepared more recently for the paperback publication, he allowed himself a little faint self-praise for his prescience.  However, what he was right about was something we both wanted the administration to prove us wrong about.  The lack of direction may be politically expedient but is harmful for so many.  Just when we can't be muddling through, we are.  (Assuming right-wing talking points on the benefice of 'austerity' is no help either, but that is outside of the current review.)ce of 'austerity' is no help either, but that is outside of the current review.)

B004A8ZX28|3.0|Plot ovrview:  Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) and his wife are going to a convention thing in Berlin, and while they are about to go check into their hotel, Harris realizes he left his briefcase in the airport. He waves down a taxi and is on his way back to the airport when a refrigerator falls off of a truck and causes them (Martin and the taxi driver) to drive of a bridge. Four days later, Harris wakes up in the hospital to find that his place has been taken by another man.    What i wanna say:  Hitchcockian, the word used by Brian Reaves in his review, is such an appropriate word to describe this movie. When I watched \\"Unknown,\\" I couldn't stop comparing it to Hitchcock's movie, North by Northwest, and The Bourne Trilogy. I guess it's appropriate to compare it to \\"Taken\\" because it was the last big movie Neeson was in, but the only thing besides Neeson that those movies have in common is the level of understanding the audience has with the characters. Both of them are shallow and they just take an insensitive approach toward killing people.    The movie is entertaining with the car chasing and the fast-action fighting scenes, but they would be a lot better if they had a plot or some character depth to stand on.  It doesn't take a lot of thinking to understand what's going on, but this can be ignored like many bad qualities in any movie nameable. The deepest emotion I felt for any of the characters was best expressed by saying things like, \\"Gee, I sure hope they don't die,\\" and, \\"golly I would hate to have that happen to me.\\" There are many nameless characters. I only remember two people's names from the movie, and those aren't even their real names. Neeson's performance is alright. His growly dog voice is getting better each movie I see him in. He still hasn't gotten the American accent down perfectly (but I think his Irish accent is way better anyway). One misleading thing: You may notice that Neeson is holding a gun on the cover; he doesn't use a gun the entire movie.    Rating: three out of five stars. And to all of you who have seen the move, I would like to say, \\"Goodbye, I'm going to go take a shower now.\\"

We waited in anticipation, with bated breath and when we heard Tom Cruise was cast as Lestat we couldn't have been more disappointed!!!! In Rice's book, Lestat was tall, slender, with an aquiline nose and an attitude of brooding over life. Cruise couldn't be more opposite of this literary character.  He was much too short, had the wrong attitude, and when viewing it, I kept thinnking \\"there's Maverick, wheres Goose?\\".

0553805371|2.0|It's not clear who wrote this book. Even co-authored books usually start with a preface indicating who did what and how much they did. There's no introduction whatsoever, so we're left to guess. The American grammar suggests one author, the rather weak humour (lists ending with something stupid like \\"...on the far side of the star Alpha Centauri, or in the shepherd's pie at your office cafeteria\\") suggests the other.    I'm afraid I came away from reading this book no wiser than I was before. It's either too simple-minded or too difficult, with not much in between. Familiar material like the double-slit experiment is not explained entirely clearly or illustrated particularly well. In general, the coffee-table-style illustrations are colourful but not always relevant or clearly captioned, which takes them down to the same level as the cartoons that every book on science thinks it needs.    Whatever the \\"design\\" is, I missed it, along with the gazillion gazillion dimensions or universes or whatever that are rolled up somewhere. When I got to the final pages and was told that stars etc. can't just appear from nowhere, but universes can, I felt well and truly had. Fortunately, I read a library copy, so the authors aren't laughing all the way to the bank with my $33.    The fatal flaw of books like this is a kind of schizophrenia. One the one hand, we are assumed to be so stupid that the sight of single equation or even the mention of the word \\"mathematics\\" will scare us off. One the other hand, we're assumed to be intelligent enough to comprehend multiple dimensions, string theory, M-theory, etc. etc. etc. As for the latter, I thought it was a bad sign when the authors said breezily that they hadn't a clue what the \\"M\\" stands for. Despite that, and the fact that they never make the outlines of the theory very clear, they confidently assert that it is \\"the only candidate for a complete theory of the universe\\". I guess they felt they had to end as dogmatically as they began (\\"Philosophy is dead\\").    Theoretical physics treated in this way is like science fiction, promising to show us something we can't understand in language we can understand.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|As a woman who recently got engaged, this book touches me on a level that might not for other people. In the book Elizabeth Gilbert discusses not only the ever changing worldly interpretation of what marriage is for and the cultural implications of such, but also dives into her families history of marriage in a blunt, open and honest way. I understand that this might not appeal to all people, but for me, getting married in 8 some odd months, it raised a lot of interesting questions. Getting married in a culture that boosts a 50% divorce rate, marriage can seem like a scary thing to get into. Coming from a family that has a long history of long marriages, it was hard for me to understand the makings of a divorce (which made divorce that much more of a scary thing for me), which made me want to understand marriage on a deeper level.    Elizabeth Gilbert does just that in this book. A mix of both historical accounts, as well as her own and her family's own experience with the concept of marriage, she guides the reader through a non-judgemental, honest view of what marriage is defined as(past and present, eastern culture vs. western culture and everything in between).  Yes, her book does get conversational at some points, which might turn off some readers, but for me, it allowed me to think about these not always black and white issues in a comfortable way. It encouraged me to ask my mother and grandmother about their experiences in marriage and prepared me to not necessarily get the answer that I expected (and, let's face it, wanted to hear). Growing up in a house of a history of good marriage doesn't necessarily mean that it is an easy thing to do, but that is what you see as a child. Gilbert made me look at marriage from adult eyes and not the innocent eyes of my childhood.    The best thing I have taken away from reading this book, is the encouragement to openly discuss what marriage is with my loved ones in an open and honest way. It is not so much a story, but aneducational tool, told by your best friend about what it means to be married and the unspoken expectations that comes along with the white-dress and the ring. They say communication is key in a good marriage, but Elizabeth Gilbert demonstrates that communication is also key in whether marriage is right for you or not.
B003EYVXUU|4.0|Many remakes, to which we have all been witness to in the last decade, have always been criticized even before it hit theaters; the main reason for that: If it's good then there's no reason to make another one, especially for classic movies or favorites by fans.<br /><br />`Let Me In' is the American version of `Let The Right One In' which is the Swedish version and obviously the original as well. The mood is identical to both movies, something in which director Matt Reeves does a great job keeping up with the same pace as the original film, and the acting was very well pulled off even though there was no need for overacting. If I was to be asked who could play the part of Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant, the boy from the original version) I would of named the kid from `The Road', Kodi Smit-McPhee, who does a perfect portrayal of the youngster who gets bullied pitiless and befriends with the vampire girl.<br /><br />One thing one can expect from this movie, being a remake of a foreign flick, is that the special effects will be better and gorier, in which both categories exceeded. A soon to become a cult vampire classic in my opinion, that not many remakes can be considered better than its predecessor.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|I am happy with this purchase. the watch face is nice looking. the time keeping is accurate enough for me. other reviewers have cautioned that the watch gains 10 or so seconds per day. if it has, it is not enough for me to notice. none of my daily appointments require me to be on time within 10 seconds of accuracy. it's an automatic watch, which means no more struggles with watch stoppages and trips to the store for battery replacement. and it is a bargain, costing about $75. I would buy this product again. the seller was good too, product delivered as promised with no problems.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is a very good product for the price.  It really cools down the cpu of your computer and doesn't produce any anoying sound. Be aware this cooler is really BIG and you need a proper computer case with enough space for it.  The installation instructions are not easy to understand but you can find videos in youtube explaining how to and it's not that hard. You could also need a long screwdriver to reach the screws under the fan (there are some holes where you can insert the screwdriver all the way to the bottom to reach those screws).  Additionally, the product comes with one Fan, not two as in the picture but that fan is good and big enough to do the job.
0670022411|2.0|I thought this book would be something like 50% Davinci Code and 50% Twilight, only a little smarter/more mature.      Turns out it's about 90% filler.  The characters fill out library call slips.  They have a 'cupa', do some yoga, go back to the library again...    At one point, the heroine is kidnapped and discovers some magical powers, and I think 'hey, it's going to get interesting now!'  Then they go off to a country house, nuzzle each other behind the ear, bake some cookies, play scrabble, read the paper...      At one point - I kid you not! - a whole chapter is devoted to not one but two meetings about paperwork that the main characters need to fill out before they can safely go on an adventure.  Powers of attorney and such.  And will that adventure ever get rolling?  Buy book two to find out!    There is a kernel of a good yarn in here that kept me reading, but I don't even want to spend time on most of this stuff in my own life.      By the way, my criticism is not about the historical content - in fact, I would have liked to have seen more substance to the discussion of alchemy, etc.  Above all, though, I think that the author needs to learn to devote more thought to the structure of a good plot.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|This is a great movie so far this year. i love the animation, blue-ray version is much better than the DVD, and the story is fresh. THUMB up if you love it.
B0030FUAKW|3.0|Bought this set, frankly, because it was the cheapest way available to get Nite Flights on CD. Finally decided to replace my lp and was chagrined to find that buying all three of these was vastly cheaper than trying to get NF by itself. And, frankly, was really only wanting the four Scott Walker songs on NF.     All that said, there are a handful of enjoyable songs spread out over the other two discs, but as a whole, the rest is rather bland, MOR soft rock that fades from memory by the time the song is over. Still, unless someone rereleases NF in an affordable package, this is still worth it.
630469654X|5.0|This movie is a hauntingly beautiful tale of two lovers cursed by an evil Bishop and their trials to get back what they once had. Matthew Broderick as the young thief that fate throws into their path is charming and braver than he knows. It's a wonderfully romantic tale. I loved this movie so much that I bought a copy for my sister as a birthday present.

B003ZTQN1I|3.0|Immediately after seeing the movie Country Strong I ordered the CD.  The songs in the movie were wonderful and I was hoping to get exactly what was in the movie.  I am still a little confused about this....a couple of the songs were done by the stars in the movie, but most of them were sung by other singers.  I have no idea why it was done this way.  It may be that the songs in the movie were not sung by the stars, however, the songs didn't sound the same as they did in the movie, so I don't think that is the case.    Anyway, there were a couple songs that I still loved from the movie, but I was disappointed by the change of singers.
1594202842|3.0|This book started well, and I was all onboard with Chua's ideas about raising children: so long as you love them, it's OK to be stern with them, hold them to high standards, and make decisions for them.  I found the series of sketches interesting, but they soon became repetitive.  How many times do we have to hear how tough it is to be a Chinese mom?  I enjoyed the sly humor in the book, but I expect many readers--blinded by indignation-- won't get it.  So, the child-rearing advice is good, the stories are mostly good, but what are the negatives?  The first thing that hits me about the Chinese mother idea is that it's basic good parenting.  It may have come as a surprise to Chua that tough love is effective, but it's old hat to most elementary school teachers and others who work with children professionally.  Likewise, Chua make it a big deal that parents ought to guide children to age 18 and then let them be.  Duh.  The tone of the book is unnecessarily snobbish and self congratulatory, and this will put many readers off.  Chua goes out of her way, to the point of tedium, to impress readers with her extensive travels and detailed knowledge of food, music, musical instruments, and tennis. A better editor would have cut it.  As to bragging about the success of her children: it's no shocker that the children of a couple of university professors turn out to be high-achieving and successful in school.  My final remark brings it full-circle:  the book has had so many re-writes and is so finely-honed that it comes off as completely soul-less.  Chua is the product of a strict Chinese upbringing, but she forgets that her re-enactment of a being a Chinese parent is her own personal interpretation.  It seems clear to me that her in-laws, friends, husband, daughters--and the Chinese parents who raised her--all have a more balanced perspective than she does.  Both Chua and her book come across as sterile, perfectionistic and soul-less.  A good painter knows when to stop.

0545265355|5.0|I've never posted a review on Amazon before but I just had to this time.  I belong to a reading group consisting of eight women, mid-thirties to fifty eight years old, who read mostly literary fiction.  We just read this trilogy and every one of us loved it.  We had one of the best and longest discussions that we've ever had.  This is classified as young adult fiction but it speaks to every age.  There is a lot to think about here, yet the books are also very plot-driven and almost impossible to put down.  What could be better?

1577314808|5.0|\\"The mind cannot know the tree. It only knows facts or information about the tree\\"<br /><br />Years ago I went for hike through the mountains of British Columbia with a classmate; we were both studying International Business, which also had a range of classes on cultural sensitivity and language. The culture classes included fascinating courses on Eastern Religion. At the time, my friend had just split with his girlfriend and with little in the way of emotional support, I commented to my colleague that I'd really gotten into Buddhism since we started the class, and that it might offer some perspective. Intrigued, he humoured me. I replied, \\"In Buddhism, the goal is to forget about the past and ignore about the future. The idea is, just as much as we can't control things happening in other people's lives, and we can't control whether it rains or not, we shouldn't try to control things which are uncontrollable. They say, doing so leads to suffering.If you just think about things you can affect, and influence, you'll be happy.\\" He nodded, thought it was interesting, and we continued hiking. Although this basic understanding reflected my earliest contact with Buddhism, it still seems valuable to me, all these years later.<br /><br />In `The Power of Now', (structured as a conversation between a patient teacher and a skeptical student) Tolle focuses most of his energy on dismantling the concept of Time. The way we think of Time (something almost no other creature on the planet could fathom), according to Tolle, is a huge cause of pain and suffering in our lives. Yes it's a book on Spirituality, and it's so densely packed with `Wow' ideas, it probably deserves a good 2 or 3 reads.<br /><br />I've always wondered, in moments of intense melancholy: why is it when we remember our youth, we seem to remember our days being jam packed with experience, and yet as we get older, the days seem so routine? We have great days and we have boring days. But sometimes I long for the `innocence' of youth where there was magic and wonder around every corner. Is it because we now know so much (as they say, ignorance is bliss) or is it because as adults we are so wrapped up in time? Time is something we humans made up to organize past, present, future, so of course, we lose touch with the moments when we try to make reference. A 5 year old with a strict routine, and appointments, seems comical. And yet that's what we do when we enter school, and our parents urge us to begin our studies. The more `timed' our childhoods are, the less of a carefree childhood we seem to have.<br /><br />If you're regretful of something you did in the past, you're trying to control the uncontrollable. If you're anxious or fearful, you're try to change something imaginary. Only in the moment, are you strong confident, and congruent. Only in the moment can you take action.<br /><br />According to Tolle, the mind that created time, and tries to categorize and understand everything (often resorting to broad generalizations and stereotypes in a vain attempt to do so), is the antithesis of Peace. Peace is attained through feeling, not thinking. In fact, the Mind cannot conceive of Peace, because it would mean ending the `overthinking Mind.' Positive peaceful moments are like gaps in a stream of noisy thought. And what is the picture of a meditation? Sitting quietly doing nothing, eyes closed, in the lotus position. What is the monk thinking? Nothing. What is he feeling? Everything.<br /><br />Tolle says the goal of `happiness', like some heroin junkie, is misguided; rather, the Goal is to be at peace. No inner conflict, and no resistance. Imagine being so peaceful that animals and plants can sense your presence. This is not a knowable thought, but a feeling, just as much as your ears can't hear colours, and you're eyes can't taste chocolate.<br /><br />And with this Peace, what can we do? Or must we completely detach from society, like hermits in the hills? Absolutely not, for this would be monumentally selfish. The greatest ambitions of generous men and women, he says, must come from a place of abundance, and a place of love. Rather than withdraw into the jungle, the enlightened ones first fix the way they see themselves, then the world, as a reflection of ourselves, changes. All the Charity in the world, has to come from a place of self-respect, of self-love. When you stop suffering, the world stops suffering.<br /><br />Just as one read of this book is not enough to absorb all its insight, one 800-word essay is even less capable. If you've ever been interested in Spirituality, consider this a great place to start (regardless of your religion).<br /><br />See more reviews like this on the 21tiger site.ns of generous men and women, he says, must come from a place of abundance, and a place of love.

B004APVI1G|3.0|Judging from the other reviews I guess I'm in the minority here.  I thought the movie was just so-so and have enjoyed others like Despicable Me and Monsters vs. Aliens far more than I did this one.  I didn't think the 3D effects were anything special.  I bought it because I wanted to add to my collection of 3D content, but I probably won't watch this again.

0375842209|5.0|I have just finished reading The Book Thief and am still in an emotional state from the ending.  I have read a number of books about the Holocust but this one was the most unusual in its contents.  The book, narrated by Death, was a combination of character building, historical settings and content and included books within the book.  The books were written by characters, a Jew in hiding, and the main character, Liesel.  Through her eyes and memories we are shown a period of time in Germany that must be remembered.  She is an observer but also a participant.  She never realizes what she is providing for all those who come in contact with her.  In some ways, I think of her as an Anne Frank.  Anne shares her days in her diary with the reader-Liesel also shares her days leading up to the end of her life in Germany.  It is a story that will remain in my memory for a long time.  P. Harper

I'd recommend it and definitely gonna buy it on DVD when it comes out.

0817439390|5.0|Very good book.  Presents information in a easy concise way. While the book does lean toward more expensive high-end cameras, photography is an expensive Hobby/Profession.  Some compositions, photographs or results require certain equipments, and some of those things cost money.  Over all a very recommended book for a beginner/novice photographer with a basic understanding of the mechanics of picture taking.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|The series, itself, is fantastic.  Just wish I could watch it.    Unfortunately, 3 of the 4 DVD's are defective.  One of the 3 defective ones can be played only sometimes (not very often, and DVD's 2 and 3 are entirely corrupted.  Only the final DVD was in playable condition.    In the past I have often bought pirated DVD's with mixed results.  I thought that buying an original copy to ensure quality on this fantastic series would be the right thing to do.  Sadly, the quality was even more disappointing than what I could pick up in Bangkok.      UPDATE:    The vendor was supurb in backing the product.  He apoligized for the inconvenience and sent a replacement copy of Modern Family.  We love it!  Keep watching it over and over again.  Can't wait for Season Two to be on the market!
B002ZG98LO|5.0|...Drop in.<br />I love a movie that kicks off instantly with an action sequence.  Pow, you're in the thick of it, shut up and hang on!<br />Yes, I have to admit it, I'm a sucker for this franchise (even the 2 movies that shall not be named), so I'll forgive them most anything; it's been a long long time between movies.<br />Why do I like this series?  It's not complicated.  Hunt or be hunted.  Scream and run.  Stop, drop, and roll.  They have a good formula.  You know what to expect and you expect most of the cast to be fodder for the Predators.  It's not art.  Although the locale was beautifully filmed.  It's meant to be exciting.  I found it so.  And better still, it's a keeper for my collection!<br />I also have no complaints with Adrien Brody, supposedly slumming in a creature feature (he has to make a living and was obviously committed to the role): he's always an interesting actor to watch.  As for poor Topher Grace (why do I have the impulse to replace the first letters of his first and last name?), he was the standard red herring; it's mandatory that most movies have one.  He was neither good nor awful, I barely noticed him or the second guy that went missing (I'm embarrassed to say that it was quite awhile before I actually realized they were down a man).  There wasn't much time to establish personalities.  I even forgave them for lifting most of the plot from that oft remade classic: The Most Dangerous Game (1932).<br />I also must add that I loved the 'dogs'.<br />It's a great franchise, I hope they keep making more.  In fact, I insist.

B003L20IFQ|4.0|This is probably one of the better films for suspense I've seen since Wages Of Fear.     If you think that a film that takes place inside a seven by three foot box would be dull - you are wrong.    I don't understand how anyone could give this film one, two or even three star reviews accept that some folks could not take the propaganda, the subject matter or the very dark black aspects of the film.  And if that is the case - I can understand why.     The plot - a contractor is held hostage in Iraq - buried underground in a coffin sized box with a lighter a crappy flashlight and a cell phone with a dying battery.      This is grueling, suspenseful, and technically brilliant film making and a least the flms star should have gotten an academy award nomination if not the director.    I wondered if the film makers were sometimes aiming for black comedy ala Hitchcock - think along the lines of Frenzy, Psycho and Life Boat.  If so - they should have also listened to Hitchcock describe the cause for his box office flop Saboteur.    Buried also reminded me of some of the better aspects of two other clustrophobic trapped people films Shuttle and Open Waters - Spoiler here - both with extremely dark down endings.     Buried is a must see for any film maker or aspiring film maker or anyone who craves clever film making and good suspense.  If Hitchcock had made a movie from this script - It could not have been any more suspenseful but if Hitchcock had made it - he would have cut out the propoganda tweaked the ending and maybe his film might not have flopped.     Now for the propaganda - and this is not meant to take anything away from the film-making aspects which were all top notch. There is allot of anti-west propaganda in the script for Buried.  For example - There is sympathy for an extremly cruel murdering kidnaper described as \\"He's just like you, his family is starving - what would you do on his situation?\\" hmmm. And then painting every western company, government agencyor person with an American or English accent as either cold blooded or inept or both.    The American victim is a very unsympathetic character. He seems to be the cause of his own problems both outside and in the box. (I almost wondered if the film makers relished giving him what he gets - I for one was not on their side) Buried paints the victim as a not to smart American mercenary who drinks, takes anxiety medicine, is an abusive x-husband and is cheating on his present wife and mother of his kids.     Had Buried not been so clever, well made and well acted I would have given far less stars for interjecting crappy political propaganda.  Hey - I don't mind when a writer or director are up front about their politics - but please don't sneak it in your film.  It's darn boring and you are toying with making a box office flop - and in this case it is what happened.     Otherwise - with some reservations - it's still great film making.

1439181780|5.0|This may sound a little over the top, but The Power really has changed my life! It has changed my perspective on a lot of things and my days are getting better and better!<br /><br />When The Secret came out, I read it and found the teachings to be true. I then read everything I could about the Law of Attraction.  When I heard this book was coming out, I expected it to be a sort of rehashing of The Secret. But when I took a look at it in a bookstore, I found that not to be the case. I was happily surprised to see a lot of new information. In my opinion, The Power has specific exercises that can change things in your life.  Using the power of love, I have learned to improve my health, change a bad day  into a good day, stop victim mentality, learn valuable lessons from problem people in my life, appreciate a lot more things that I have, and live with more joy.<br /><br />I will definitely read this book again and again. In fact I use it almost daily to improve my mood. When I feel a little stressed or something upsets me, I read a small portion of the book and like magic, the joy returns to my life. It is really an amazing book!

Unfortunately they are still young enough that they were not terribly interested in this movie. It's a classic so definitely worth adding it to the collection, but don't expect it to be watched over and over again if you have young boys.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|This movie is an example of how skilled special effects artist can really expose a poorly executed film. The special effects had it ratcheted up to 11 while the acting and directing really lagged behind. It was like watching two movies. You were blown away by the special effects and when it came time for the dialog you just want to fast-forward it.  -  The whole \\"Hurry it's right behind us!\\" thing was WAY over done and things got hokey real quick.  -  It's a sound premise, a descent story...But it went WAY overboard and into the realm of silliness.  -  Hats off to the special effects artists, yeah some of the more elaborate \\"run away\\" scenes were over the top and stupid...But they were just doing what they were told and did a great job of it.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|First, I purchased the Kindle edition of the book and hesitated over what I consider a higher than usual price $14.99. However, I really enjoyed this book! It faintly reminded me of The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova, not in story line, but in that you really feel like you are are being told a tale. I would recommend this book if you have any interest in a modern day vampire/witch story that happens to dig deeply into research and historical references. Honestly, it was the first book in awhile that made me stay up too late and left me eager to spend any free time on the couch reading. Well written, this is not a casual vampire/witch love story where there's anguish and lots of dangerous or forbidden sex. There is an unraveling of a story with strong characters and while some paths may seem predictable there is enough substance to keep a voracious reader engaged. Bravo!
0439023521|5.0|I cannot believe I have waited this long to read this book! I am absolutely obsessed. I can't wait to start the next one. Actually right after this I am starting Catching Fire. Every chapter in this book ended with a sentence that makes you keep reading. And if I wasn't reading the book, I kept thinking about Katniss and when I could sneak in a couple more chapters during class. I can definitely see what all the hype is about.    The romance in this book definitley won me over (not surprising, I'm a sucker for romance). My heart goes out to Peeta and I'm hoping things get better for him and Katniss in the next book.    This trilogy is totally addictive and I'm going to wrap this up so I can go get my hands on the next book.    If you still haven't read this trilogy, I recommend you get to it as soon as possible.

B0041KKYCY|3.0|It's hard to talk about a remake without mentioning the original. I saw the first film in the 80's, and remember sort of liking it, but being pretty unimpressed as a kid. My girlfriend and I recently watched it again on DVD, now with a beautiful restored print as opposed to the washed out garbage from the old VHS, and we both had the same reaction. It was a much better, well made, well acted, more powerful movie than either of us remembered. A month later we went to the one theatre that was showing the remake, and we were both pretty disappointed.    The new ISOYG is not a bad film by any means, but it pales in comparison. Without getting in to too much detail or giving too much away, the difference is clear in the first five minutes. In the remake, when she gets to the gas station, the men there come right out of the Hollywood, backwoods, creepy, we are gonna kill you in the woods later cliche machine. There is no doubt that these guys are up to no good. The staring, the sexually suggestive comments. This girl had no chance. In the original, they were harmless. the main guy was just doing his job and the other men were off being fools. The lustful thoughts sunk in later.  Also, going forward to the revenge, the originals seemed much more organic, where now it turns into a cross between Hostel and Saw. There is some  ridiculous use of CGI that takes all the tension out of one scene. The \\"artsy\\", cold blue tint to the image is just unnecessary and a reminder of how the original did not need such gimmicks to evoke emotion. The addition of one character turns the film into Hollywood's most overused cliche.   On it's own the remake is good clean, revenge fun, but they should have just given it a different title to not sully the original classic.

It is a great movie in that it is well written and completely believable but the inhumanity of war is all too real in this movie.  It is the kind of movie that I will watch once, but cannot bear to watch it again as it is too sad to see over and over.

B000EXZI0K|3.0|Like others have stated, if you liked 'Main Course' by The Bee Gees, you will like this cd too.  The music on this disc is great and I bought this group of songs enough in different formats, so I must love it.  Yes, I still have the 8-track, the LP and the original cd version.  I also had it in cassette, but it is long gone.  You obviously like the music of this disc or you would not be here and since so many others have commented on the music, I want to comment on the sound quality, in everyday terms.<br /><br />Like so many of you, when it came out on cd, I snapped it up.  I hope I can now save many of you the disappointment I felt in purchasing this cd all over again for the sole reason of it being - REMASTERED.<br /><br />I am not going to say it is not Remastered, but I do have my doubts.  I transferred the songs to WAV files and matched it against the original cd put out years ago.  The changes I could see in the graphs were very minimal at best and volume level was about the same, very low.  It is almost as if they may have added a small bit of volume and called it Remastered.<br /><br />When I listen to selections from 'Children Of The World' on either the Remastered 'Greatest Hits' or Remastered 'Mythology' or Remastered 'The Record', the songs sound vibrant and fresh as if they were made to today's standards.  'Children Of The World' disc sounds like it was copied from a cheap source and not the quality sound you'd expect from The Bee Gees and Reprise.  The other Remasters sound clear, full and crisp.  The WAV files of these songs also are very noticeably fuller than those from 'Children Of The World'.<br /><br />When I compare the cd inlay and cover, they are very identical and the cover is actually a folded cover with no pages like a booklet would have.  The inside is basiaclly the same although they added about 6 lines of written text from the title song to a picture.  When you read the credits, they are the same word for word and nothing is written about it being a 'Remastered' disc as it is advertised here and other places.<br /><br />All and all, if you have the original cd, there is no need to waste your money on this one as you will not notice any written or sound differences.  If you do not have this disc and like it or like the Bee Gees from the 70's, it is a great disc.  For quality Remastered Bee Gees though, stick to the compilation discs I mentioned.  Reprise blew it on this one.  I just hope that someone will come out with a truly Remastered 'Children Of The World' and 'Main Course'.  Hope this helps you.[[ASIN:B000001FAW Children of the World]]advertised here and other places.

B0049OSQ18|4.0|The Decemberists made a smart move, in my mind, when they decided that \\"Down by the Water\\" would be the first release from this album.    I instantly recognized the guitar playing of Peter Buck of REM on the song.  Not that the song could not stand on its own, but by adding Buck they drew in legions of REM fans like me.  It also helped that I am a novice guitar player and found the chords online -- and I could play them.    The songwriting is outstanding, and musicianship is impressive on \\"The King is Dead.\\"  It's really a combination of folk and indie rock, honed to be more radio friendly than past efforts by the band (so I have read).  The sound is clearly Americana, with mainly acoustic instruments and minimal electronic.    \\"Down by the Water\\" is not the only good song on the release. \\"This is why we fight\\" and \\"Don't carry it all\\" are catchy too. On the other hand, I found  ''All Arise!\\" too be too much alt-counry.    I definitely recommend it.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I just finished reading STILL ALICE on my Kindle.

0312600844|1.0|I am finishing this book only because our book club assigned it.  It is a superficial portrayal of middle class life.  The prose is tedious and the subjects uninspiring.  There are too many good books to waste your time on this one.
0307272702|5.0|Other reviewers have summarized all of the book's points rather well already, so I'll just say this: in the four months since I first read WWGF and began following the advice laid out therein, I've lost over 60 pounds, normalized my blood glucose readings from previously prediabetic levels, reversed the other symptoms of metabolic syndrome that were beginning to manifest, and my blood lipids look better than they ever have.

B000001ESP|5.0|First, on the remaster.  I definitely noticed that my original copy of the CD sounded flat compared to the sound on more recent releases.  Given that \\"Moving Pictures\\" stands one of my favorite albums of all-time, I figured it made sense to step up to the re-master.     The sound difference is clear, but only if you are playing it on a \\"real\\" sound system in your car or in your house.  I cannot say that I noticed any difference on my iPod (and I have good headphones).    As for the album itself, it's part of the soundtrack to my life.  \\"Moving Pictures\\" and the subsequent \\"Signals\\" will always remind of a time in my life.  Rush (Neil Peart, in particular, as lyricist) knows how to reach people throw their music.  \\"Tom Sawyer,\\" \\"Red Barchetta\\" and \\"Limelight\\" are masterpieces, pure and simple.      Rush has always been known for its outstanding musicianship.  \\"Moving Pictures\\" marked a turn away from their past efforts to craft epic songs and tell long tales (like 2112).  This album was more radio-friendly and thus pushed Rush to true stardom as opposed to just being a cult band.      Ironically, it fulfilled the sort-of prediction Peart made in \\"Limelight\\" in which he documents the perils of fame and how to deal with it.  \\"I can't pretend a stranger is a long-awaited friend.\\"

The optical quality is excellent and it is very easy to snap onto almost any lens.

I highly recommend this product to try macro photography without the need for an expensive, dedicated macro lens.
B004I7IPL2|5.0|...as with all of the Saw films, this movie left me wanting more. I truly hope it's not the end of the series. Especially if it means seeing more of Costas Mandylor!

Thank you to Lionsgate and everyone involved in Saw for this tremendous series.

B0002EXH5E|5.0|This disc RISK has obviously been thoroughly reviewed and debated and I have to say I wasn't thrilled with this divergence at first listen, but once I understood it better and really LISTENED to what Dave was doing I fell in love with this one too.  My favorite 'DETH disc is Rust in Peace - and for a very good reason.  It just kills! So I know what Megadeth is.  I wasn't fooled or offended by this one.  If Dave was just showing that he could out-do Metallica at everything, INCLUDING making a more impressive, more interesting attempt at being radio-friendly (for lack of better words) then he achieved it.  I didn't think for a moment that this was the beginning of an entirely new musical direction for Megadeth, especially taking into consideration the title.  Not scared. Not offended.  Dave rocks - that's all there is to it.  He proved that Megadeth would have been a far better, more original \\"sell-out\\" than Metallica if they chose to go that route.

0670022411|5.0|[[ASIN:0670022411 A Discovery of Witches: A Novel]] by Deborah Harkness was a fantastic read! I was prompted to purchase this based on some well received reviews I had come across recently.  This is much more than a vampire book.  (Although, I was a fan of the Twilight series and don't say that snidely.)  However, Ms. Harkness managed to bring to life a world where witches, vampires, daemons, and humans walk freely among each other- with only the humans being blind to that fact- that I hated to leave on those occasions I forced myself to close the book.  (My kids did have to eat, and I needed at least a little sleep each day.)  This book was an amazing history and science lesson, disguised as a love story, both romantic and familial. Diana Bishop and Matthew Clairmont begin as a witch and vampire, with very different agenda's in terms of a bewitched manuscript, and end up as the great love of each others life.  Which is saying something since Matthew is a seriously OLD vampire!  The couple travel the world, overcome family prejudices- who knew that these groups both view the other as being lesser creatures?- and battle evil, all in the hopes of trying to figure out what the manuscript means.  As other reviews have pointed out, everything is not wrapped up in a neat little package by the end of the book.  Although slightly annoying, I was aware that this was the first of a trilogy, so it didn't bother me as much as others.  I also agree with other reviewers that the pace of the story was much more engrossing in the first 3/4 of the book or so.  However, it is not enough to deter me from giving this novel a full 5 stars.  2012, when the next installment is due, cannot come quick enough for me!

B004DI7HZ6|2.0|The premise of this book had such promise, the settings were lavish and a lot of research went in the book, but I felt unsatisfied. I was hoping for Possession mixed with Petty Magic, but I've read better paranormal romances with lower price tags and fewer delusions of grandeur.    Although the author, Deborah Harkness ([...]), has written nonfiction books and writes a blog on wine, this is her first fiction book, and it shows. Big blobs of information are dumped in, slowing down an already slow-moving story, bad news if this is supposed to be a thriller. (In some ways, the whole book feels like the back story to another novel.) The characters are fairly original but talk in cliches. There's history and cosmology, but not enough complexity. For a book this big, there should have been a second storyline or a more cohesive epic feel. This is Twilight with history and wine thrown in.    If you don't want spoilers, stop reading here.    The heroine is supposed to be a super-busy college professor, yet she spends weeks mooning over the vampire, going to yoga, telling her aunts she can care for herself and then being unable to protect herself. She doesn't seem to need to check in at school, do much research or other work. She spends a lot of time picking out bad clothes to wear, exercising, getting hurt, falling unconscious, and sleeping it off in someone's care. Perhaps she would have been less ditzy if the story were told from a third-person point of view. I was hoping someone would slap some sense into her at some point. She dithered about the magic book that started everything for more than 200 pages before considering trying to find out more about it. Then the magic book disappeared and the plot dragged even more. Ugh.    Then there are the parallels to Twilight. The mysterious, sexy vampire shows up and almost immediately begins protecting the heroine. He can go out in sunlight, he's superhuman fast and strong, his skin is cold and white, he smells good and he dresses in gray and black. He's spied on her in her sleep and finds her scent intoxicating. He warns her he's dangerous, but she tells him she knows he won't hurt her. He says he won't make her a vampire but takes her home to meet his vampire family. The two fall in love despite warnings to stay away from each other, yet remain chaste, even after pledging their undying love. Oh, and they start a war in the supernatural world.    I guess the original part was supposed to be Diana's powers as a witch and other weird coincidences about her. Petty Magic was far more original in terms of the magical house and the the family of witches, and the longing of the heroine felt more sincere in DeAngelis' book.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This is a fun movie!  I lost my original DVD so this on is a replacement.  Sandra and Ryan  have great chemistry and I would love to see them in a sequel or another project.
B003EYVXTG|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Wikipedia informs us that the classic 'hillbilly' stereotype began during the Great Depression. The image was one of \\"the poor, ignorant, feuding family with a huge brood of children tending the family moonshine still.\\" Filmed in the Ozark Mountains, 'Winter's Bone' continues to advance the same stereotype--this time however, the 'hillbillies' are not making moonshine but rather cooking up the more deadly brew of methamphetamine.<br /><br />When we're first introduced to the film's protagonist, Ree (Jennifer Lawrence), she's taking care of her almost catatonic mother and two much younger siblings. The family is so destitute that at one point they shoot squirrels and eat them. One wonders why no social services agency becomes involved with this family. After all, the local sheriff is quite familiar with the family's situation--that Ree, a 17 year old minor, is caring for the younger siblings and the mother is a virtual basket case. Wouldn't the sheriff have been obligated to report the family situation to social services so they could be placed in foster care? After all, if something happens to those kids and law enforcement was found to know about it, they could be held liable along with the county for not calling in various helpful authorities.<br /><br />The inciting incident occurs early on when a bail bondsman informs Ree that she has a week to find her meth-selling father who has used the family home as collateral to be released on bond. Ree seeks help from various relatives including 'Teardrop', her uncle, who at first wants nothing to do with finding brother Jessup, Ree's dad. Teardrop's strategy is to intimidate his niece, so that she won't get into trouble when the meth dealers get upset over her snooping around trying to find her father. It's established early on that people in town are scared of Uncle Teardrop due to his deep-seated anger management problem (Teardrop likes to smash car windows and refuses to get out of his own vehicle when ordered by the police).<br /><br />Ree eventually contacts other members of the community who she is supposedly distantly related to. One of these men is Thump who heads a group of meth-dealing bad guys.  He gets the word out that Ree should not be snooping around but she won't listen.  Because of the hillbilly code, he ends up sending the womenfolk to beat Ree up. Finally Teardrop levels with Ree, explaining that her father was killed because he was an informer. I had a hard time believing that Thump and his men didn't kill Ree outright as she was doing all that snooping around. You would think that meth dealers wouldn't give a hoot about some old hillbilly code about not hurting a woman. And then despite the fact that they outnumber Teardrop, Thump and his men somehow accept his word that Ree won't snitch. Unlikely. And then they capitulate and send the womenfolk to cut off Ree's father's hand, as proof that he's dead. And here his daughter accepts that? The point I guess is that people are so intimidated by meth dealers, that their spirit is completely crushed. So Ree makes a 'deal with the devil' in order to save the family. You've got to assume that law enforcement is so totally corrupt that they look the other way in every case. Here, Ree assumes the police know about what's happening and will take no action. So there's not one good person in law enforcement who might try to do something? So they're all completely intimidated and ineffectual? No higher authorities become involved in cases like these?<br /><br />Sure there are cases where people are intimidated and refuse to cooperate with law enforcement. But if everyone did that, the vast majority of criminals would get away with their crimes. So you have to buy this whole scenario and I have trouble doing that.<br /><br />The problem with 'Winter's Bone' is that most of the hillbillies are creepy, malevolent figures, reminiscent of some of the unpleasant characters in thefilm 'Deliverance'. Ree comes off as hardly heroic, refusing to rat out her father's killers in a desperate bid to save her family.  It's understandable but nothing to cheer about.  Similarly, we're asked to sympathize with Teardrop too as he's saved his niece from the clutches of murderers--but he too is complicit in his brother's murder.<br /><br />'Winter's Bone' was directed by Debra Granik, a Columbia film professor. She is to be admired for using some local talent during the filming and does a fine job in getting good work out of her director of photography and editors. Nonetheless, her big mistake was deciding to adapt the source material, a novel which apparently promotes the idea that there is a community in the Ozarks who are completely unlikeable and have little or no redeeming qualities, due to their association with the methamphetamine trade. Even if we accept the idea that there is an underclass of such people, how about humanizing those characters by giving them some kind of personality, instead of depicting them as suffering from a terminal case of uncontrollable hostility?film 'Deliverance'.

B001PJRAUS|4.0|Okay, when I first watched this film, I have to be honest: the Austenite in me was absolutely horrified and hated it! But, like a horrible automobile accident, I couldn't stop watching it. And, at the conclusion, I realized that somewhere along the journey in this convoluted,  mixed-up Austen fantasy world, I fell in love with \\"Lost in Austen\\"! Now, I laugh out loud at the things our modern day heroine, Amanda Price, goes through in Austenland, and the modern twists she brings to this familiar story are hilarous!    My tip: make SURE to pause the movie right before Caroline Bingley asks Amanda to sing, then pull up any You-tube video that shows the next, missing scene: Amanda singing \\"Downtown\\". HILARIOUS! I think I watched that scene 50 times. Then, go back to the film. I think they couldn't procure the rights to the song for the DVD, so they had to cut that scene... but it NEEDS to be in the story. Watching Darcy's face while she is singing is priceless.     So, in short: throw aside all your Pride & Prejudice expectations or Austenite prudishness and simply enjoy this funny film for what it is. Is it perfect? No. But it's very enjoyable. And, like if you, too, like Elizabeth Bennet, \\"dearly love a laugh\\" and delight \\"in any thing ridiculous\\", you will enjoy this film!
B00133KFGW|1.0|This was one of the most unrealistic, sappy, poorly acted movies I've seen in a long time. I thought the kid who played Evan/August was terrible. In addition to what I thought were generally extremely limited acting skills, he displayed virtually no change of emotion throughout the entire movie, for which I blame the director. Being upbeat and hopeful are nice virtues to be sure, but this was ridiculous. And what kid, who is supposedly a musical prodigy no less, in his right mind would trade a free Julliard education to go back with Wizard? That was a patently stupid contrivance apparently used solely to extend the running time and ramp up the tension for the even sillier contrivance that brings them all together. Speaking of Julliard, do they routinely enroll homeless orphans who possess no identifying paperwork at all? Is that even legal?  Were they appointed his legal guardian by some competent authority or did they just assume the role on their own? Not one character in this movie came across as resembling a real human being in my opinion. Honestly, this movie was worse, in just about every way, than most movies intended for children.

0307474712|4.0|... and you don't know it. Emma and Dexter. It's the 15th July 1988 in London. They meet and like each other, but they will have to part tomorrow. The unusual choice by the author to write each chapter describing every 15th July after that, until near-present day, is quite captivating.     So many reviews have been written already that I would only like to add my praise to the author for a brilliant and compelling story. Emma and Dexter, along with a few peripheral characters (some more in the picture than others), are entirely believable. I loved Emma's good-natured personality, I would have liked to jump into the book a few times and shake Dexter's insecurity-often-bordering-arrogance out of him and often it felt like really \\"being\\" there.     A well structured narrative delivers funny, realistic, moving moments depending on circumstances. An unusual, engaging love story. Well done to David Nicholls. My true vote: 4.5 stars.

You could get the regular DVD version, but it doesn't come with the 3-Mini movies, which are sold as a seperate disk. (Or you pay extra getting them both together.) This is just wrong. This is basicly punishing people who still value and use DVDs - because they are trying to force you to buy the Blueray edition. There is no reason this couldn't have been sold as a two-disk edition. In fact, it would have been more inviromentally friendly to just do that, instead of making a second DVD case just for some minor special features.    And the worst part of it is - those mini-movies just aren't that funny. Steve Carrel is noticably abscent from them. The only redeeming nature of the second disk was a feature telling about the voice-cast of the movie. There is no reason this couldn't have been put along with the regular DVD disk - they are just trying to make a quick few extra bucks by annoying us with \\"sold seperately\\" special features. I hope they did make money - because I'm libable not to come back and buy another movie sold in this fashion next time.    It really is a great movie. But you can save some money and just get the Single DVD Edition. The mini-movies just aren't worth it.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Nothing has to be said about the Dexter series, other than if you haven't started watching it, what are you waiting for? The prices you can get these well worth Seasons are so affordable and they arrive just in the nick of time. The only negative thing about Dexter Series is you can't stop watching them and even if you do, you find yourself thinking about it all day long.
0385732554|4.0|Have you ever wondered what the world would be like if everything was the same, and there were rarely any choices? Lois Lowry does an excellent job of exploring a society without the freedoms and the decisions most people have today. With detailed looks into the mind of one teenager growing up in a society of sameness, The Giver answers many of the questions that people have about giving people complete freedoms and choices. By not giving all of the information about the society at the beginning of the novel, Lowry keeps the readers intrigued and waiting to see what Jonas will decide to do. The Giver is the perfect book to relax with while stimulating questions of why society is the way it is and how is could be incredibly different.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I am ordering another one of these for my daughter. I bought one for my son a few months ago, and he LOVES it. He uses it with his Mac to play WOW. Price is MUCH better than any retail store around here.
B001GJ7EDU|5.0|I was telling a friend about Entrapment before I rented it. I just had to show her so I rented it online through Amazon. I love this movie and Sean Connery, what a fox no matter how old he gets!
B0041CGOZS|5.0|This collection showcases the best of Bon Jovi and I really love it! Included is Who Says You Can't Go Home,the duet with Jennifer Nettles of Sugarland-what a great song about home and what it means. If you love Bon Jovi,you must add this cd to your collection!
B0006OBPTA|5.0|Bought this combo pack for my son.  He loves them.  We watch them all the time.  Great price for 4 movies.
0439882826|5.0|All right, so we just picked this one up at Borders (store is closing) and after one flip-though, I'm on Amazon to order another for my friend and his kid. The pop-ups are STUNNING, there is incredible detail, and I can't believe they packed all of this into one book. After going through it with our 4 year old, I remarked to my wife that I would expect to pay well over a hundred dollars for a collectible item of this quality. The Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker light-up sabers at the end are just \\"WOW\\".  Really....it's that good.
B004HD2ZIQ|5.0|This is the best Motorhead album in years if you like the original sound. I like them all<br />even the heavier stuff. The songwriting is great and catchy. The playing is excellent<br />as usual and Campbell and Dee should get more attention. They blow away the so called gods<br />of metal that get all the attention but I won't mention them. oh the singer is the worst.<br />hint! the dvd bonus is great from 2006 only 5 songs but worth it. Most hard rock music is<br />horrible now so if your looking for the real thing this is it! Lemmy rules!
B000009HF2|1.0|Can I take away stars? Grade him with five negative stars?  He left Humble Pie for this kind of music!?  What a pile of trash. It would be insult and overrated to call it even elevator muzak.  Nothing here,not a single listenable track.
0061801313|5.0|If you think the t.v series is good then Pretty Little Liars is a must read. This book is for a mature crowd so anyone over 15 would enjoy this book series. Also the price for a book set of 4 is a steal. At any store you would have to pay 8.99 plus tax for one book when you can get 4 books for about 15 dollars
B000068FXR|1.0|I am a professional sound mixer and a long-time Supertramp fan and this \\"re-master\\" (as with all the \\"re-mastered Supertramp albums) is a CRIME.  The primary flaw, in my opinion, is that it is terribly over-compressed, (which was most likely the directive from the hip, young \\"executives\\" at A&M - \\"make it hotter\\"; therefor the legendary mastering engineer is not entirely responsible for this mess.)      The problem with trying to make a record mixed in 1975 \\"pop out\\" by compressing it and making it \\"seem\\" louder, is that it horribly skews the balance of the original mixes; on this \\"re-master\\" you will hear a completely different relationship between the bass guitar and the kick drum, and certainly, as previously mentioned, much more \\"brittle\\" high end, not to mention a \\"flattening-out\\" of the dynamics of the original mixes - a quick comparison of the audio waveforms between the two versions shows just how much dynamic range has been lost.      This is a CRIME against the artists and original producer and mixers, since from this point onward this MESS of a re-master is what people will have available to them for purchase.  It can not possibly represent the creative intentions of the musicians, and is a crass and mis-guided attempt to \\"update\\" a work which has it's place in the history of pop music.  If you want to hear this music as intended, you would be better off trying to find a used copy of the original CD release, despite the problems inherent in those versions - this version, to my ears, constitutes a remix, and is a terribly bad remix at that.  Shame on you A&M and Mr. Legendary Mastering Engineer - you know what you've done is wrong.
0071120009|5.0|This book came relatively quickly. I wasn't in desperate need of it at the time I ordered it. When it arrived it was in perfect condition. I only wish there was a newer version. It is a pretty popular item, at least for the amount available, so if you do need to order, make sure to give yourself a week for delivery.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Upon my husband's recommendation, I ordered this CD.  My sister and I both love her and can't wait to purchase 21.
B004HWYTP4|2.0|It is sad that so many excellent actors agreed to play for this pile of elephant dunk. I dont mind goofy movies, but they have to be smart to at least a small degree. The jokes and the humor in this production is just plainly stupid and not funny. We quit watching this in half time, bored and frustrated to tears.
0385342039|5.0|I'm a huge Sophie Kinsella fan, but I dragged my feet when it came to reading this novel.  I wasn't sure how I felt about a \\"ghost\\" story and to be honest, the premise didn't interest me all that much.  When I finally started reading it though, I fell in love with the story and the characters - especially Sadie.  A tad far-fetched, but not utterly unbelieveable - I found myself laughing out loud throughout this book.  I love, love, love the parts where Sadie has Lara dressed up and making a fool of herself.  I also found Lara's situation very relatable - 29 years old, recently dumped by a boyfriend, and in over her head at work - who hasn't found themselves in a similar situation before?<br /><br />This novel did seem to be on the longer side, with a lot of character development and build up, but I just didn't want the story to end.  It's so light-hearted and warm, with just a touch of mystery - a perfect novel to curl up with on a rainy day or to read while laying at the beach.  I do hope Sophie Kinsella continues writing new novels now that I've officially finished reading the ones she currently has in print.  I have to say - Twenties Girl is one of my favorites and Sadie is one of my favorite fictional characters of all time!
B000MD9UJC|3.0|The LED works great but I was unable to focus the light afetr installation because the LED sits higher than the old bulb did and when i turn the lens to focus the light, it immediately stopd because it is hiting the LED assembly.  Not sure why this is as the installation is very simple.  It may be because my AA Mag-light is quite old and this unit works with newer models.  Called cust svc but they couldn't help and offered to send a replcement but the same problem exists.
0066620996|4.0|What impressed me most about this book was the extent to which the author assured the reader about the depth of research and hard data used to draw the conclusions.  While it is normal for human perspective to enter our opinions, I am convinced that the best efforts were made to be objective.  One of the comments that really jumped out at me involves motivation: \\"Under the right conditions, problems of alignment, commitment, motivation, and change largely melt away.\\"  The idea here is that if we have the \\"right\\" folks on the Team, we don't have to motivate them.  I enjoyed the discussion of the Hardiness Factor and Stockdale Paradox along with the Hedgehog Concept.  It was also surprising to hear about some \\"expected\\" findings that, in fact, were not the case.  All in all, this was well worth my time to read and I recommend it.
0446569895|5.0|I grew up in the 80's so the Ozzy that I knew wasn't the comical, stuttering MTV family man of today but the Prince of darkness. Black Sabbath's scary, out of control singer who bit the head off of bats and doves and worshiped the devil. (Or so the rumours said)  My brother used to play his records (yes I'm that old) during his rocker/bad boy phase (he's now with the RCMP) and I remember being forced to listen to Ozzy Osbourne Crazy Train and Bark At The Moon 24 hours a day. Ozzy's exploits with drugs, women and Satan were legendary. In those days he was the ultimate in heavy metal music, if you wanted to be cool there just wasn't anybody badder or scarier.<br /><br />So you can imagine how strange it was for me to see him years later bumbling around with his family on MTV. Who the hell was this guy?  Although he did provide an excellent example of the 80's campaign \\"this is what happens to your brain on drugs\\" (anyone remember that ad with the fried egg?) It was hard for me to comprehend though that this was the same man, Ozzy was the devil not a man who lived in the English countryside with a wife and kids. I was intrigued enough that I had to read his biography, to figure out which Ozzy was the real Ozzy. The truth is though, they both are.<br /><br />Honestly this is one of the better rock biographies out there and I give credit to co-author Chris Ayers who's managed to piece together all of Ozzy's insane stories yet still allowed his true voice to ring through. I did wonder how on earth Ozzy could possibly write a book much less remember anything after 40 years of drug and alcohol abuse but it turns out the godfather of heavy metal remembers quite a lot. We start at the beginning in England with \\"John\\" growing up in a poor factory town without enough to eat or an indoor toilet. Crazy from the get-go John always wanted more and his rise to fame is an amazing journey.<br /><br />Ozzy admits early on to struggling with dyslexia and I can only assume that he dictated this, leaving Chris Ayers with his work cut out for him. He's done a fantastic job though because this flows really well and every page is funny, fascinating, shocking, at times unbelievable and brutally honest. All the dirt is here too so if you're a fan of the music then theres a plethora of information about album covers, lyrics, band politics and the truth behind the music. We also get to see a lot of other rock royalty joining in the debauchery. In the end I wondered (as Ozzy does) how he's managed to stay alive through it all. All aboard ....<br /><br />Some of the many highlights for me were;<br />32 pages of color photographs<br />His jobs in a meat processing factory and testing car horns (pardon?)<br />His rise to fame and first experiences in America, the land of plenty (of cocaine)<br />His sexual exploits with groupies including an aids scare<br />Details of his first marriage and trying to keep it together for the kids while seeing Sharon<br />Almost killing a vicar with hash cake<br />The real story behind the bat<br />The death of his guitarist in an airplane that crashed into his tour bus<br />Waking up in the middle of a freeway<br />Figuring Betty Ford could teach him to drink like (James Bond) a gentleman<br />His remorse over the moments he missed in his children's lives because he was always pissed<br />Buying a horse because he couldn't pass his drivers test and riding it to the pub<br />The realization that guns and booze don't mix<br />His numerous arrests including the infamous pissing on the Alamo<br />The chaos that ensued after the success of the Osborne's<br />His love for Sharon<br />His political views<br />Meeting Bush and the Queen<br />The horror when he wakes up in jail not knowing why he is there and is told he tried to kill Sharon.<br />Why he stutters and shakes<br />How Sharon stuck by him through years of outrageous intoxicated behaviour.<br />Where he is nowyers with his work cut out for him.

B0014VQGX4|5.0|Bought this for my 2 1/2 year old son who loves any type of construction equipment. He \\"digs\\" with it in the sandbox every chance he gets and, so far, it's held up well. These Bruder products are made better than the others we've seen in the stores. Of course if they get thrown around and dropped all the time something will eventually break or break off. That said, if the child knows that he/she needs to try a little bit to take care not to drop it, it should last for many years. After buying 2 backhoes at Wal-Mart that pretty much just fell apart when played with, spending the extra money for something that will last is a no-brainer. We have bought additional Bruder products and they are made the same way - To last!
B0000025D0|4.0|a classic album i owned years ago which i recently purchased do to the hype surrounding the promise.  i was not disappointed.  this is classic springsteen and it is fantastic.  haunting and charging both rhymically and lyrically.  the boss earns his title here.  if you are just thinking about getting into springsteen this would be a good place to start and if you are thinking of rediscovering his genius again this would be a good place to start.  some of the best tunes he has ever written are contained on this album or disc more appropriately.  purchasing this compact disc will not disappoint the buyer and in fact, will leave you with hours of soul searching music and the appreciation of a true music icon.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|The knife is everything you would expect, given the detailed descriptions left by others and the manufacturer.  Excellent quality and durable. Always appreciate being able to support products that are built in the good ole U.S.A.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Fawlty Towers is a rare comedic treat. It ingeniously combines the mundane everyday with the absurd. A great stress reliever.
B004GGQMRY|5.0|I remember this movie being so good even though I saw it so long ago. Its touching and relates to my 5 year old who is Autistic. Never understood what Autism really was when I saw the film but now I know.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book in my opinion was excellent! I felt so bad for both Katniss and Peeta. Just when they were getting closer they're ripped away again! For a good 80% of this book, I cried. Especially for Cinna, Finnick, and Prim! I didn't want Prim to die, Katinss took her place in the games so this wouldn't happen so this defeated the purpose. I wish I could say they had a happy ending but with their lives you know that can never happen. They can only get so close. Great end to a wonderful series!
0670022411|3.0|I heard about this from various sources.  Working in an independent bookstore we heard the rumblings from the publisher.  When the Reading Copy arrived several of us were particularly interested in the concept.  Honestly I like the idea and being a historian I was immediately drawn to the history, but as the book moved on it gets stuck.  It was not stuck to the point of giving up, although I can see why some would throw up their hands and say \\"enough.\\"  This book needs serious editing and yet I am still intrigued.  My fellow readers in the store all felt the same way.  Where was the editor?  We are still interested in the next book and the move back to the seventeenth century.  If, however, the story does not pick up we will not continue to recommend this book with reservations.  Read it, enjoy the history and the relationships and hopefully book two will fulfill the promise of book one.
