B000002USN|5.0|\\"I have got you under my skin\\", those sexy lyrics and tunes.  I have always dreamed of dancing to New York, New York, on a ballroom dance floor, in one of those flowing gowns.  But I don't have enough money for the ballroom rental or to buy a gown, much less looking pretty cheap with playing a CD for an occasion, not to mention serving kids meals.     I never would have listened to him if I had not been introduced to him from some co-workers - we are looking at the early 20 to late 30 age group. So it depended on the person he was paired with before I would purchase a CD.  But I kept his music in my car as I travel far, and I turned the music up high, as I sing poorly so my voice sounded better. Music is like love - you just have to take a chance.
B005SZAEYO|4.0|For weeks and weeks now I've seen those weird and downright creepy commercials advertising \\"American Horror Story.\\" After about seeing the same commercial with the guy with the spandex suit thirty times, I finally decided just to see what the heck this show was about. It's a horror show. Well like a kintergardner would say- NO DOY! It's created by the guy that made \\"Nip/Tuck\\" and who CO-CREATED \\"GLEE.\\" I just performed all caps rage for saying that because a lot of people have seemed to be turned off by that. I was too-kind of. Of course I knew it had nothing to do with a bunch of unsocial high-schoolers singing songs that made me want to pour acid down my throat, that being said, and finally just said \\"What the heck? I'll just check it out.\\" OH-MY-GOD!! I was just shocked at how well done this was made. It's very insteresting and is very scary. It's absolutley nothing like \\"Glee\\" or \\"Nip/Tuck.\\" My problem with this show is that if it has a second season- what would it be about? I've seen plenty of horror films and know that there isn't a true extending story. It's usually DEATH-DEATH-CREPPY STUFF-DEATH-KILL-CLIFFHANGER. Now I know horror films, usually slashers, have sequels. But they're usually about different people or the main characters have to go through the same crap from the first one ALL OVER AGAIN! I have high hopes for this show- but I just don't what they're going to do with it. I really enjoyed the pilot- and I'm looking forward to watching it again. Even if my horror film theory might have downgraded it for some- STILL WATCH THIS! It's weird, creepy, and feels like the television mini-series version of \\"The Amityville Horror.\\" I highly recommend this show. Overall, I give it an 8/10.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|Say what you will about Lady Gaga, but she's a bona fide talent. This album has it all. Gaga has evolved incredibly since her 2008 debut \\"The Fame,\\" with the techno-pop disco songs \\"Just Dance\\" and \\"Poker Face\\" and the 2009 follow-up EP, \\"The Fame Monster.\\"  On \\"Born This Way,\\" she opens with the rock-tinged \\"Marry the Night,\\" but the album's first single and title track \\"Born This Way\\" is the true standout here.  Many have compared the song's sound to Madonna's \\"Express Yourself,\\" but this is an unfair analysis.  Although the song's beat and message are distantly similar, \\"Born This Way\\" is distinctly Gaga. It has become the unofficial dance anthem of misfits everywhere, with the same universal message of acceptance and tolerance as Christina Aguilera's \\"Beautiful.\\"  Like Madonna, Gaga is a frustrated schoolgirl at heart, and this is most evident on the hit \\"Judas,\\" which outraged officials at the Catholic Church (and, of course got her plenty of headlines in the press). This is also evident on the song \\"Bloody Mary,\\" complete with myriad references to the Virgin Mary and Christianity. There are also enough religious allusions in the song \\"Electric Chapel\\" to make any fundamentalist religious fanatic blush, and perhaps that is the point.  Gaga is a global artist, which might explain the Spanish-tinged track \\"Americano,\\" and the techno-disco \\"Sheiße\\" in which she sings a few lyrics in German. She also is not afraid to take on American myths of power and womanizing, such as slain President F. Kennedy in the song \\"Government Hooker,\\" in which she sings, \\"Put your hands on me/John F. Kennedy.\\"  The power-pop ballad \\"You and I\\" could be by any classic rocker from back in the day, in which Gaga professes drunken love to a \\"Nebraska guy\\" with, of course, more lyrical nods to the ever-elusive Jesus. Lady Gaga is a true provocateur.
B000002AGN|5.0|I was in a music store in Munich, Germany and I was first drawn to Dave Brubeck by the cover art.  I like jazz and thought I would give it a try.  He is fantastic.  He turns my home into a jazz venue with his renditions.  I would normally hit the jazz clubs on Saturdays, but every Sunday morning I would invite friends over and make a buffet with Dave Brubeck and it was like he was in the room playing, as if we were in one New Orleans at the Court of Two Sisters for brunch.  Even if I do not have access to play the CD, I have played Take Five enough to run it through my mind; the drums, the cymbals, the horns.  I would never make love to the music, as it would be difficult to keep my feet in pace with the rhythm. But he takes me away from anything inside and outside of my world and I am in his, just listening, drinking beer and relaxing to a jazz genius.

B000005RRP|4.0|Truly a breakthrough recoring for the Mark 2 Deep Purple.  And it is even better with the bonus tracks.  Solid opening with the one two punch of Fireball and No No No.  Great solos and vocals on these two puppies.  Demons Eye is pretty good but a litle plain.  I like the Purp's attempt at country with Anyone's Daughter.  Cool lyrics and different vocal style.  The Mule kicks but not one of the better tracks with not enough vocals.  Fools rules and No One Came is ultra cool with amusing lyrics.<br /><br />Happy Strange Kind of Woman made this one as it's a catchy tune with more oomph to it than the somewhat plain Demon's Eye.  The rest of the tracks are ok and sometimes fun. I do not hear the difference between the 2006 No One Came and the original.  Like the take on the William Tell Overture.  The backwards piano is unnecessary.
055357342X|2.0|The writing is exceptional. The plots are well thought out. But unless you're rooting for the villains of the story... you're going to be severely disappointed.<br /><br />Call me crazy, but I'm of the opinion that a story should have some feel good moments. Not once in this book (or the previous installment for that matter) does the story ever move in a direction positive for the good guys. Now I'm not one to insist that the good guys should always win. But at least let them (and the reader) have their moments under the sun. Any time the story seems to be building up for to a climactic victory for the heroes of the story, the rug gets yanked out from under them, and most often done within a few paragraphs. After 3 books, and a few thousand pages, you'd think that at least once the good guys would catch a break.<br /><br />If you're the type who always roots for the villains then this book is for you. If you're the type that can't stand several pages dedicated to building up to what appears to be a great moment, only to yank it away within a few paragraphs, quite often inspiring you to throw the book across the room... then steer clear.

And then when they were indubitably proven right, the rest of the world looked the other way and refused to apologize.<br /><br />It's very inspiring.

B003XVYLDU|5.0|Slaughterhouse Five turned out to be a very different book than I had anticipated going into it based on some descriptions I had read of it. At times the book was tragic, other times poignant and other times a bit comical......sometimes all 3 at the same time. Wherever Billy's story took us on this story that centered around his time in World War 2, there was always a sense existential fatalism to the tale that was driven home frequently by his key phrase in this book, \\"so it goes...\\". At times that phrase was an interesting device, at times it was annoying, at times I thought it was overused but by the end it was clear that his use of that phrase was really a cliff notes version of his fatalistic view of war, tragedy and inevitably of loss presented here.<br /><br />Overall I liked the book quite a bit, though initially the stream of consciousness style narrative made it a bit challenging to become engaged in the events that were unfolding. But, once I settled into the groove I was able to join Billy's \\"pitiful\\" time in the war and his unthinking acceptance of the events that unfolded in his life regardless of their impact on him. It was also a book that challenges one to make sense of this life and question where meaning can be found so in that regard, this book was a success and better than most because it entertained while making you think and reflect.<br /><br />So all in all, I enjoyed this tale quite a bit. While this was my first Vonnegut novel, having now acquired a taste for him, I'm sure it won't be my last.
B002ZG99QS|3.0|Quick review: bad, but still entertaining if you go in with the right mindset.  Watch for mindless entertainment, but don't expect philosophical challenges, or character growth, or even coherence.  Zo relaxen und watschen der blinkenlichten.<br /><br />More general review...<br /><br />This is a popcorn movie, plain and simple, and anyone who watches it looking for something else (except, perhaps, some nostalgia for some) will be extremely disappointed.  If you like special effects and \\"stylish\\" visuals, or if you just want something big and absurd, however, you'll probably get your time's worth out of this movie.<br /><br />Story:  This is the film's principle weakness.  \\"Tron: Legacy\\" has so little substantial to its plot that it's difficult even to isolate anything to critique.  The overarching story -- which is to say, that of the main character -- is sort of a coming-of-age drama; but the narrative delivery is so generic, shallow, and bland that the main character's entire arc falls flat.  This is accentuated by the fact that the movie is absolutely infested with subplots that clutter the narrative.  Everyone you meet, it seems, has a narrative arc of some kind: old Bridges is repenting of playing God, young Bridges is the spurned good son, Wilde is the physically competent yet wary and fragile innocent, Sheen sold his soul to the devil...  It's a mess, and the movie suffers for it.  It's difficult for the view to get invested in anything in particular; this, together with the melodramatic tone and wacky pacing, make the plot of the film very hard to take seriously.<br /><br />Acting: For what it's worth, I think the acting in this film was certainly passable, and in places quite good.  Old Bridges is the stand-out performance (the animators seem to have made a valiant effort with young Bridges, but more on that later), but Olivia Wilde is refreshingly convincing as the wide-eyed innocent without being cloying or obnoxious.  Hedlund's performance is by far themost ironic, as his role in the iconic \\"video game film\\" seems to be the stereotypical \\"video game hero\\": as flat and bland and generic as they come.  Mind, this is not a comment on Hedlund's performance; part of the irony of his performance is that he displays noteworthy acting skills in the course of portraying this blandest of characters.  However, in my personal opinion, the performance that summed up the film best was Sheen's performance: farcically overdone, outright ludicrous, and intellectually vapid, but fun to watch if you can get past all that.<br /><br />Visuals: As mentioned above, very stylish and well-done...with one exception.  I understand the technical challenge of trying to digitally replicate the face and behavior of a younger Bridges, and the special effects team deserves to be lauded for their effort.  However, the final result of their efforts is a cartoon of Jeff Bridges that lands with a resounding thump at the bottom of Uncanny Valley.  The effect is still impressive from a technical perspective; but from an artistic perspective, it's just not ready to be used in a film.<br /><br />Sound: Sound effects seem nice and crystaline, though they never really come into prominence.  At several points as the music plays, you will find yourself wondering why the movie is playing the \\"Inception\\" soundtrack.  Otherwise, the music and sound seem to be nicely unobtrusive, serving the rest of the movie very well.<br /><br />General Comment #1:  There's a fun game you can play while watching \\"Tron: Legacy\\"; I call it, \\"Try to spot the things ripped directly from other films.\\"  I found rips from \\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"The Phantom Menace,\\" \\"The Matrix,\\" \\"Transformers,\\" \\"Iron Man,\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" to name only the ones I can remember off the top of my head.  In many cases, the film doesn't even seem to be trying to appear original, leading me to believe that a lot of this may have been intended to be homage.  Whether or not that is the case, I don't thinkthese rips and references really detract from what is already a very silly movie; in fact, in some ways, they add to it.<br /><br />General Comment #2:  Going back slightly to where I said \\"Tron: Legacy\\" rips from \\"The Matrix,\\" I need to qualify that statement.  I have not seen the original \\"Tron,\\" and so it's very possible that \\"The Matrix\\" ripped from that movie while \\"Tron: Legacy\\" is just following in the footsteps of its predecessor.  Be that as it may, I do have to say that \\"Tron: Legacy\\" doesn't do Matrix-esque things as well as \\"The Matrix\\" did them, particularly in regard to the periodic philosophical tangents.  In \\"The Matrix,\\" characters would periodically embark on philosophical rambles that, while they didn't express groundbreaking ontological insights, they added context and depth to the rest of the film.  \\"Tron: Legacy\\" seems to try to do something similar -- Bridges' character has an alarming tendency to ramble incoherently about the paradox of perfection, and spirits coming in the form of self-writing \\"isometric\\" algorithms in a computer, and so on -- but the attempt falls very, very flat.  The philosophical ramblings come across as disjointed, ambiguous, and largely irrelevant to the plot.  And in case you're wondering, an actual understanding of physical computer systems does not add to Bridges' rhetoric; in fact, much of what his character says is blatantly and provably nonsensical, and consequently the movie's attempts to appear learned and insightful come across as extremely pretentious.  If you watch this movie and are afflicted with a reasonable amount of technical knowledge, I recommend trying not to think about the things Bridges is saying because hearing the \\"wise\\" character make a fool out of himself does detract from the experience.  It's better just to pretend he's talking about string theory and eat your popcorn.
068484267X|2.0|I love the way this author writes but felt depressed reading his book Angela's Ashes. That his father was such a drunk, was more than unjust to his family. I can't imagine what it would be like to endure the kind of life Frank lived as a child. What sticks out mostly in my mind, is the part where the mother started to remove the wooden trim in the apartment and use if for firewood because they were so poor and cold. What I do not agree with, is that this author tells this story as if his mother was some kind of hero. She was lazy and one of the most horrible mothers I have ever heard of. Nothing heroic about that woman. She had no backbone even to the point where she would let her own kids starve to death. If you can read a story like this one, without getting depressed then I say go for it. Otherwise skip this one.

0805080120|5.0|Discerning readers will savor the Unfolding of Language at three levels.  First, the information is exceptionally interesting. You'll likely never talk or write again without appreciating one or more of the insights this book provides. Also, it's the perfect antidote for dinner-party-pedants who chronically lament that, after a long and glorious history of eloquence, English is now rapidly descending into a series of tribal grunts. The big challenge when you skewer these blowhards will be trying not to look smug.  At a second level, this book is just extremely well written. The author's style and wit are a great pleasure all by themselves.   Finally, the Unfolding of Language is a paragon in the category of explaining complicated topics. Deutscher not only makes his topic easily understandable, he does so with a fluidity that makes the acquisition of so much knowledge seem simply natural. As an author who has tried to do this for a different topic (The Essential Guide to Computing), I can appreciate how hard it is to succeed. For one of the few comparable works, see The Machine That Changed The World.   All in all, this is a superb work that should be at the top of any non fiction list.  Garrison Walters

0316098329|2.0|I must say that I absolutely hated the first 50 pages of this book. I almost stopped reading it at that point. However, I pushed on and once I got used to the voice and writing style it became easier to digest. I didn't hate this book and I didn't love it. I found it to be \\"okay\\" and that's about it. I wouldn't even say that I could recommend others read it. If you want to read a good book that deals with this same exact issue, read \\"A Stolen Life\\" by Jaycee Dugard. That's a true story/memoir, in her own words, and she shares what happened to her when she was held captive in a backyard shed for 18 years.
B00003JRCQ|1.0|It's been a little while since I first (and last) watched this version of Persuasion, but I remember very well how much I disliked it.  I promised myself as soon as it ended that I would never watch it again.  Persuasion is a late novel, one of Austen's most autobiographical.  It's a story written by and about a woman who'd lost love and reconciled herself to never finding it again.  Nowhere in this adaptation does that idea come about.  And if you've honestly never read the book, I'm astonished you even know what's going on throughout the film.  And still more, one of the greatest things about Austen's novels is that they still have the power, even now, to make a reader feel exactly what the character feels.  Unfortunately, this adaptation of the novel has none of that power.  Even knowing how Anne feels in any particular scene (from reading the novel a dozen times), I still couldn't see any sort of emotion from Amanda Root--every emotion seemed to be exactly the same.  But, that said, Root by no means displayed the worst acting in the film.  That dishonor goes to Ciaran Hinds, who can't play a romantic character to save his life.  His acting is based on extremes--there's either too much emotion or too little.  He displays an intensity that's just a little bit too uncomfortable.  And for the two romantic roles I've seen him in (Wentworth in this and Rochester in the '97 Jane Eyre), he introduces a violent and quite frankly frightening side to his characters.  That's fine for a staged adaptation or something, but not for a film--it's a liberty that can completely ruin a character.  Austen's heroines love their heroes not because they represent forbidden pleasures and masochism but because they're men--usually just plain and simple men.  And even worse than the poor acting are the horrible age discrepancies between actors and characters.  It's one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to film adaptations of beloved Austen novels.  The majority of Austen's heroines are in their early twenties--some are still in their teens--but it seems that when these characters are cast for a film, their ages are completely ignored.  In the case of this Anne Elliot, Root fits the part to begin with, but when Anne \\"regains her bloom\\" in the novel, nothing ever happens to Root, who still looks a little old and haggard.  And Hinds was 42 when he played the part of Wentworth, a character who is in his early to mid thirties, and he looked every day of his age.  I can understand casting for talent more than age, especially with a beloved classic such as Persuasion, but there's no talent here.  They could have hunted down a couple of university students who would have looked their part better and acted much better than the two leads.  For someone who has read the novel (or even someone who hasn't), I would suggest staying away from this verison of Persuasion.  Honestly, if you want to watch a version of Persuasion, turn to the '07 version.  It's not entirely true to the book, but the majority of the liberties they took with the story are acceptable, and the acting is immensely better.  An adaptation with a few good liberties taken can turn out to be better than an adaptation that claimsm to be entirely true to the novel.
B002M2T1UO|3.0|We love the shield television series and followed it every week.  I was very excited to order and to have my own copy of the series, however it did not meet my expectations.  The book jacket for the dvds is beautiful and very nice for organizing the discs however when we watched the discs they froze, they skipped scenes, they were terrible which was very saddening to us.  We made a call to report the situation and were offered a refund. I checked the written reviews and found this complaint multiple times with the probable defect of the dvd slots causing scratches on the discs.  The item was new and costly, I considered returning it but checked into repairing the discs ($6.00 per disc @ Game Stop) so I went online to learn how to repair disc, bought the items  and gave it a wholehearted try;, some, but minimal improvement.  Oh well, I own it.  Don't buy it!

B0000028PI|3.0|After the pop hair rock frivolity of 1989's `[[ASIN:B0000026T4 Trash]]' and 1991's `[[ASIN:B0012GMYTG Hey Stoopid]]', many saw Alice's 1994 release, `The Last Temptation' as a roaring return to form, rooted as it is in a far more serious approach than its two immediate predecessors. Many also now consider it as part of a dark trilogy to which 2000's masterful `[[ASIN:B00002MTVE Brutal Planet]]' and its 2001 sequel-of-sorts, `[[ASIN:B00005NVJI Dragontown]]', can be added. The truth is, though it certainly sports a strong concept album style a la `[[ASIN:B000002I99 Welcome to My Nightmare]]' (in this, a young boy - Steven, again - enters a horror sideshow that is really a metaphor for the horror of life and the modern world around him), it somehow lacks a sense of fun and the knowing wink that all four albums released either side of it manage to share to varying degrees. It also, despite the collaborators featured on it (notably Chris Cornell from Soundgarden on writing), feels oddly lumbering, dated and old fashioned.<br /><br />Part of this problem probably sits with the trait `The Last Temptation' shares with many albums from big names in the 90s - and that is a number of different producers working on separate songs, rather than one unifying producer working on the entire record. The old-fashioned, almost prog rock affectations, of this album are even weirder when you consider the three producers - Andy Wallace (who had produced for Henry Rollins, Ned's Atomic Dustbin, White Zombie and Jeff Buckley - 5 tracks), Don Fleming (Hole, Teenage Fanclub, Sonic Youth, The Posies - 3 tracks) and Duane Baron (Ozzy Osbourne, Foreigner, Heart - 2 tracks).<br /><br />It is all very well played and Alice is in fine voice. But, other than the superb punk-styled rocker `Lost in America' (which also sports the only real note of humour), it lacks any sense of immediacy or abandonment. `It's Me' is a fine, quintessentially Cooper ballad. `Lullaby' has superb finger-plucked verses let down by a too-obvious chorus and `Nothing's Free' is a strong scene-setting rocker. While it is certainly not bad, the overall package lacks punch, attitude and drive. Oddly controlled and constrained, it is really only for completists.ous chorus and `Nothing's Free' is a strong scene-setting rocker.

B002TVQ4HG|4.0|This movie starts off in a way that made me scratch my head.  As you go further in the movie the head scratching may continue, but in a good way.  For some the headscratching is ridiculous, the questions that arise become tiresome.  If you liked the show 'Lost' I have great confidence that you will enjoy this movie. If you didn't like the show 'Lost' you will probably not like this movie.  Just approach it with an open mind and realize that things are not as they seem as you continue on your journey.

B0034G4P80|1.0|My son and I watched this tonight. We like action films and this one was a complete bust. The computer animations are sad, and the story line...  wait, what am I saying? There really was no story line. We're left with a poorly done film with worse acting and no closure.  What a waste of time and money.

B0002KQNJU|5.0|Director Roman Polanski's masterfully brilliant, &#34;the Fearless Vampire Killers,&#34; (1966) is a loving tribute to earlier Hammer Studios horror films, ala', &#34;The Horror of Dracula,&#34; it's sequels, plus a multitude of other Vampire films the studio released.<br /><br />&#34;The Fearless Vampire Killers&#34; is in my opinion, the first modern day horror/comedy, or should I say, comedy/horror? Sure, you had earlier films like &#34;Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein,&#34; &#34;Ghost Breakers,&#34; &#34;the Old Dark House (both versions),&#34; even &#34;the Munsters&#34; & &#34; The Adams Family&#34; on TV. These films were geared more towards a younger audience, both in their horror & comedy, where&#34; the Fearless Vampires Killers&#34; is a much more adult & sophisticated in it's comedy & horror, but that is not to say it can't appeal to most age groups today in this environment.<br /><br />&#34;The Fearless Vampire Killers&#34; is about the bumbling adventure of professor Abronsius (Jack MacGowran of, &#34;The Exorcist&#34; - &#34;There's a alien pubic hair in my gin.&#34;) & his assistant, Alfred, played by director Roman Polanski, looking for Vampires in Transylvania. Professor Abronsius is a expert on the bat, & has wrote a paper on the existence of Vampires, but is the laughingstock of his peers, so off he & Alfred go to Transylvania to prove the existence of Vampires & exterminate their plague. These two are so hilariously inept, that they make Abbott & Costello look like Batman & Robin!<br /><br />The movie starts out with a sleigh ride in the snowy forested mountains of Transylvania, with wild dogs chasing them. Alfred beats them off, while professor Abronsius sleeps, or at least we think he is sleeping, but when they get to their destination, a boarding house inn, the professor is frozen solid, something that happens quite easily to him. Once thawed out at the boarding house, they find garlic hung all over, as the professor smiles & points at all the cloves hung up & asks about the garlic, but to no avail, & our story starts.<br /><br />(Spoilers)<br /><br />&#34;The Fearless Vampire Killers&#34; is just filled with one hilarious scene after another. Especially funny is the scene stealing, Shagal, the innkeeper, played by Alfie Bass! When Shagal isn't ogling his female maid, Magda, or sneaking in to her room only to be rejected by her & hunted down by his 400 pound wife, Rebecca, he is kicking his beautiful daughter Sarah (Sharon Tate) out of the bath tub, as she takes two or three baths a day! Sarah taking her ritual bath is attacked & kidnapped by head Vampire, Count von Krolock, played with great tongue in fang by Ferdy Mayne. She's whisked off to the Counts Castle. Shagal goes out to rescue her, but is himself turned in to a Vampire, a Jewish Vampire, which leads to one of the funniest scenes in the movie, as Shagal goes up to his maids room, Magda, to bite her & she pulls out a cross, &#34;Oiee, oiee! You got the wrong Vampire,&#34; Shagal giggles & feigns off the cross with a gesture of his hands.<br /><br />All this eventual leads our dynamic duo, professor Abronsius & Alfred to the Counts castle to kill the Count & save Sarah. Here Alfred meets up with the Count's son, Herbert von Krolock, who takes a shine to Alfred. Yes, the first gay Vampire in movies! Alfred does not know if he is more horrified that the Counts son is a Vampire, or gay, that wants to put the bite on him, literally, LOL! There is a hilarious chase scene between Herbert & Alfred, that just has to be seen to believe! Later, Count von Krolock describes his son as,&#34; a sensitive youth,&#34; & as I said earlier, one hilarious scene after the other ensues! But, &#34;The Fearless Vampire Killers&#34; does have it's share of down right eerie scenes & a soundtrack that is truly eerie, & in turn, funny at all the right times. A soundtrack that is as original as the movie, & one that is memorable! The film would only work two thirds as well with out it.<br /><br />True, &#34;The Fearless Vampire Killers&#34; could be construed as a comedy with sprinkles of horror, but the two work so seamlessly together, that the film is a part of both genres, as a whole, & truly the first of it's kind! Many films have copied it, followed it, but few have matched it, & none have surpassed it. &#34;The Fearless Vampire Killers&#34; is just a master work of acting, script, plot, & direction. All the cast members are perfectly cast. It's cinematography truly amazing! This is a film that is beautiful to watch! It's sets, magnificent! It's setting, lonely, eerie, cold, & beautiful! This film begs a top notch transfer to Blu-ray!<br /><br />&#34;The Fearless Vampire Killers winks at you, as it bites your neck, but you don't mind. If anything, it will be your tummy that hurts from laughter, & not your neck when you watch this film!<br /><br />5 Stars = Masterpiece4; could be construed as a comedy with sprinkles of horror, but the two work so seamlessly together, that the film is a part of both genres, as a whole, & truly the first of it's kind!

0062060554|5.0|The story begins with us meeting Christine who has just awoken in the morning. But she doesn't know where she is, who she is, and who the man next to her is.  We soon discover that she has suffered a severe trauma, and for some years, she has been unable to retain any memories. So when she goes to bed of a night, her memory is wiped clean of the day before and many years before also.  She is middle aged, but when waking up she expects to be a twenty something year old.  We experience Christine's horror, confusion and suspicion as every morning her husband Ben tells her who she is.  Then, we discover that Christine has been keeping a secret journal which has on the first page \\"Do not trust Ben\\". As we travel with Christine through her daily journal, her life and the questions she has, we wonder who can she trust? Her husband? Her best friend? He doctor? Who is telling her the truth, and who is telling her lies about her past....and why?  Can Christine figure out the truth of her past to save her future?

6303244645|5.0|Gustav Mahler is as great as Mozart or Bach was,  perhaps even more so. The magnitude of what Mahler's music is and who the man was is conveyed within every frame of this film. He is not only the bridge between Romanticism and Modernism but he himself was a bridge between old world and post industrial revolution Western Europe. I almost need to wait to watch Mahler again, I don't want to be reminded that I don't live in such a beautiful world of forests, conservatories, demi glasses of chilled Gew&uuml;rztraminer and cascade houses.<br /><br />First things first-Georgina Hale owns as Alma Mahler. Robert Powell rules too but without Hale for him to play off of this film would not hit you as hard emotionally. Powell is a great actor, severely underrated, but he's also gifted with insanely fine and beautiful features that most women would envy (he played Christ) and an intrinsically graceful carriage. I can think of no one better to play Mahler and he makes it look easy.  But Hale must fight genetics and she triumphs. Georgina Hale's very tiny endowments, thin lips and large forehead are insanely sexy. She's also a natural dancer and her voice crackles simultaneously with humiliation, self confidence and passive aggression. Mahler is her film. By the end she had been so many different women: loyal wife, adulterous wife, failed artist, desolate mother, tormentor and best friend that we know Alma Mahler is real.<br /><br />Powell looks more like Mahler than Mahler. Beautifully lit, cameo angle shot in deep pine green that becomes daylight on a moving train-just gorgeous. The crowds and their brass bands await Gustav at the station like a war hero but he's sick and can't be arsed. A flashback in the loo takes Mahler back to his years as a child; his large Jewish family having come up from working class to middle class in one generation; the kindly swim instructor slash mentor slash Joe accordion and the freakiest piano teacher since Dr. Terwilliker in the \\"5000 Fingers of Dr.T\\". Yet, Skiddaw, the great mountain of the Lake District steals this section. In my mind I know I'm looking at England yet how and why I can only see Eastern Europe/Germany/Austria is a mystery. Ken Russellis a master and that is why he can create such cinematic alchemy. DO WATCH THIS FILM!!the great mountain of the Lake District steals this section.

B004P8JPS6|5.0|I really, really loved Lee Child's a newest Jack Reacher novel, The Affair.  I think it read so smoothly from beginning to end and there was no question what was happening and the story was very easy to follow.  This suspense novel goes back to 1997 to the beginning of Jack Reacher's story.  Jack, a military cop has to go to Carter Crossing, Mississippi undercover to find out about the recent murder of a woman.  It is suspected that the woman was killed by a soldier on the military base that is at Carter Crossing, but the soldier has strong ties to Washington, D.C.  Soon Reacher finds out that two other women have been murdered, and all three have one thing in common.  They are all extraordinarily beautiful. The sheriff of Carter Crossing, Elizabeth Devereaux, is also a beautiful woman and she spent 16 years in the Marine Corps. Elizabeth and Reacher can't be sure they can trust each other, but they decide to work together.  She has figured out that he's military undercover, anyway.  Reacher has a way of taking things into his own hands and Elizabeth is a little bit the same way.    The lengths that Jack Reacher goes to to solve this case and the doubts that he and also the reader has make for a truly great novel.  It's a thriller of the best kind.  It took me two evenings to read it and I solved it all wrong, which is nothing new.  The train really added another dimension to the book and it was used several times as a threat and as a sound machine.  It's very cleverly written into the story.   I recommend this novel of suspense to anyone who likes mysteries, suspense and thrillers.  If you've read the other Jack Reacher novels, then you'll love this one.  Five stars for The Affair.

1423140591|4.0|Percy's back.<br /><br />That's all most fans of Riordian's Percy Jackson series are going to need to know for this book to fly off the shelves<br /><br />The Son of Neptune is the second book in Riordian's Heroes of Olympus series, which is itself a follow-up to his Percy Jackson and the Olympians series.  Readers new to Riordian's world will probably want to start at the beginning of the Percy Jackson series with [[ASIN:0786838655 The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 1)]]--the backstory makes the Heroes' series much more enjoyable.<br /><br />The Son of Neptune is what we've come to expect from Riordian:  lots of action and adventure as our heroes travel on their cross-country quest, humor, a touch of teen angst, and plenty of mythology.  We meet a few new heroes--and spend time with a few familiar faces.  It's a fast-paced, entertaining, thoroughly enjoyable read.<br /><br />It loses a little of it's shine when compared to [[ASIN:142311339X The Lost Hero (Heroes of Olympus, Book 1)]], however.  For one thing, we know more of what's going on.  Percy's memory loss is less of an issue for the reader than it is for him--we already know who he is, what he can do, and something about his ultimate mission.  In some ways the book feels as if we're marking time until Jason and the Argo II show up at camp. The book also lacks some in the character development department.  Hazel and Frank are good characters, but their journeys of self-discovery are less compelling than Piper's or Leo's.  I actually flipped through the book at one point hoping we might hear from Piper again in ths book.  We didn't.<br /><br />Regardless, it's still an entertaining and enjoyable read. Riordian fans will enjoy this new journey back into his world and look forward to book three coming out next fall.<br /><br />Did I mention that Percy's back?

B0039TD7RC|4.0|The remastered EXILE sounds ... OK. Better than the old CD or vinyl versions? Well -- as someone who started out listening to rock on a little transistor radio under the covers at night, maybe the subtleties of enhanced audio processing are lost on me. I think I actually like the original better, though I don't have the musical or technical vocabulary to precisely explain why.<br /><br />I really got this for the second disc of previously unreleased tracks. And here again ... interesting, I'm glad to get to hear these, but I'd be even happier about it if I'd paid a little less. \\"Loving Cup\\" is a great alternate version, and the different-lyrics-over-the-same-music \\"Soul Survivor\\" sung by Keef is fun, though I wish written lyrics had been provided. But it's pretty much yeah, the best songs were already on the original album in the first place.
B00004VWA7|5.0|There are expertier experts than I for commenting on the technical sophistication pertinent to masters like Mr. Pastorius, but I know what I like. These compositions are first rate as everyone knows and after all the listens they still excite me. My favorite is Kuru/Speak Like a Child. It cruises. For a first record I can see why so many were stunned. The genius is just so obvious. Starting out with a Charlie Parker piece with just bass and conga is startling all by itself, but then all the following Pastorius tunes cement the deal. Another favorite is Portrait of Tracy--smooth perfection. Also: Continuum, Okonkole Y Trompa, (Used To Be A) Cha Cha, and Forgotten Love to finish off. There's also a 6/4 Jam in the bonus tracks that's quite worthwhile--an understatement, eh? Don't forget, there's Sam and Dave on Come On, Come Over! Sam and Dave!

B004GE81CK|5.0|This is the simplest and best album the Bee Gees did. Long before all the gloss and dross and over-reaching, they did pristine little pop songs that just happened to hit the charts. Every local band in my vicinity had To Love Somebody, Holiday, and New York Mining Disaster 1941 in their set lists. Red Chair, Fade Away is one of my permanent choices along with Please Read Me (though they missed the Beach Boys harmonies by a mile), I Close My Eyes, and Close Another Door. Arrangements and sound are certainly time-period specific and  home to my ears--pre-computer production has something natural going for it. They clearly had something moving forward at this point and except for some tasteful light orchestrations, they kept it simple and let the songs breathe. And Robin got some solos.

0446571415|2.0|I,m sorry I had to write a spoiler but I couldn't find any other way to review this one.<br /><br />The book's first half was excellent.

Kamkwamba grew up in Malawi as the child of subsistence farmers. A famine struck, and Kamkwamba's family couldn't continue sending him to school. So - mostly to stave off boredom - he got books from a local \\"library,\\" which consisted of two shelves of books, mostly textbooks donated from America. He taught himself the basic concepts of electricity and built a windmill for his family. The book is well-written and gives Kamkwamba's story honestly, helping us to understand the difficult childhood he must have had, which makes his achievements that much more impressive.
1558908358|4.0|I had seen the original \\"Tron\\" movie in the theatre in the early 80s when I was in my early 20s and I loved that movie. Flash forward to 2010, when I saw \\"Tron: Legacy\\" in the theatre with my 24 yr old son, who had been intruiged by the trailer and wanted to see that movie. We both loved it. He had not seen the original \\"Tron\\" movie, and we finally corrected that.<br /><br />So a few days ago my son and I watched \\"Tron\\" (96 min.), and what an experience that was. This was the first time for me seeing this movie since its original release in the early 80s, and I must say I am immensely impressed with this movie, now 3 decades later. It was then, snd still remains to this day, ahead of its time. Yes, some of the scenes, particularly the \\"current\\" 80s scenes, are now outdated, but once the movie gets into the \\"inside video game\\" sequences, I am impressed how well it holds up. Remember, this was done 3 decades ago! But it still feels futuristic. What a great experience to see this movie again after all these years. And to watch it with my son just added to the enjoyment. He was quite impressed by the movie too, even more so that this was made so long ago.<br /><br />Now having seen the original \\"Tron\\" again after all these years, I can tell you that I like this movie better than \\"Tron: Legacy\\", which for one thing was way too long, and its story long was way too concocted to make a lot of sense. The original \\"Tron\\" has a certain sense of innocense to it that it sadly lacking in \\"Tron: Legacy\\".

B002S0OBMS|2.0|Ridiculous! Nonsensical! Garbage! Stupidity! Gave it 2 stars for a worthwhile song or two, the rest, ludicrous.<br />  The world waited with breathless anticipation for this sequel to Phantom of the Opera, the wildly, unbelievably successful musical, and it just doesn't work. There is no sequel in Gaston Leroux's original story, so how could they think having the story continue 10 yrs later in Coney Island (???)could possibly work? Because people very badly wanted it to, no other reason. But the story is amazingly inane and just plain stupid as hell.<br />The most beautiful piece in the show is the title song, which Lloyd Webber had apparently rehashed several times. While the melody is ravishing, the lyrics in this version are weak. To hear an amazing, breathtaking version of the music get the recording Andrew Lloyd Webber Divas, the song The Heart Is Slow To Learn is included, sung by Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, with lyrics by Don Black. First introduced by Te Kanawa a few years back at Lloyd Webber's birthday concert, and thankfully put to disc soon after. It gives chills, it is absolutely gorgeous, and I think part of the reason why people thought the sequel could be possible. Had a show arisen with the same quality as this piece it would have been amazing, but that didn't pan out unfortunately. Llyoyd Webber's ego is a bit out of control with this one. For die hard Phantom fans only.

034552554X|5.0|I just finished this book and i want to go back and read it again...it's an amazing debut novel that will blow you away with its unique story and unforgettable main character.  there are twists and turns along the way and a lot of insight into different types and stages of love and the eternal question: what makes someone a mother?  i am looking forward to any future novels by the author - this first novel is written like an old pro with no false steps and a wonderful voice...take a bow, ms. diffenbaugh!
0375703764|5.0|Very awesome and interesting book! Sort of switches between the main story and side stories, some of which tend to get a little boring. Otherwise, it is great! The author was really creative when writing this book for sure. Kept me wondering what will happen next throughout the whole book :)
B0059R5Q08|5.0|This movie was one of the best I've seen in a while. Superb acting, superb overall. I will definitely buy.
B002OSY2T6|4.0|Incredibly durable toy. It is meant to move along so baby will chase it and learn to crawl. My grandson is not so interested in following it but his cousin, who just turned one,  loves to chase it. Both boys love to play with it and sometimes in the process of getting tugged on it falls or gets slammed hard and not a scratch on it. Great toy!
0385342039|5.0|Twenties Girl by Sophie Kinsella is an absolute pleasure to read.  It is hysterically funny, playful, tender and sweet.  Lara (the protagonist) is determined to get her ex-boyfriend back even if it means enlisting the help of Sadie, who is the ghost of her 105 year old deceased great aunt.  Lara has a tendency to stalk poor Josh and when she is suddenly haunted by Sadie she puts Sadie to work spying on Josh.  In return, Sadie puts Lara to work by having her pursue Ed, the American top executive and hottie Sadie has developed a ghostly crush on.  Lara and Sadie are also on a mission to solve the mystery of Sadie's missing beloved necklace.  Sadie cannot go to her final resting place until the necklace has been found and returned to her.  In between stalking, messing with people's heads, trying not to appear insane and trying to achieve all their goals, Lara and Sadie have a hilariously funny time.  Twenties Girl is by far one of the funniest and sweetest novels I have ever had the privilege to read.  I highly recommend.

B004VMUS9G|4.0|got the pro version when it was the free app of the day.  I've been using it for a few months now and so far I've only been able to disarm it and miss my wakeup twice.  my husband hates it cause her can never figure it out!<br />my only gripe is that when I first used it I didn't trust it so I left my native alarm on.  if that went off when this app did too, it freaked my phone out and I couldn't turn xtreme off.  I'd have to turn the phone completely off...which I guess technically means it still worked, since after all that I was totally awake.

B004ZN9J0K|4.0|This is the album where Pink Floyd came into their own.  Some fans will contest that \\"Meddle\\" is the first real Floyd album, but I think it's here where you really hear the roadmap for everything that came afterwards in thier career.  Of course, it's also the transition album, where Syd Barett quietly disappeared, handing over the reins to David Gilmour.  And while Barett had a songwritting credit on many of these songs, and even appears on a few, to my ears, Dave's presence completely overshadows Syd's here.  As far as the remaster, I don't think this one is quite as improved as some of the other 2011 remasters, although it is still a definite step beyond any other version released to date.  I have the original CD pressing, the 1992 \\"Shine On\\" remaster, and the 1995 remaster).  I suspect this may be due to limitations in the original tapes -- this was recorded in 1968, after all.  Ironically, the most improved to my ears are the two tracks I like the least, \\"See Saw\\" and \\"Jugband Blues.\\"  But as with the other remasters, I generally hear a wider, more resonant mix than previously, with better resolution on the bottom end.  All in all an improvement, and if you're like me, and are enough of a completist to NEED all of the Floyd remasters, I think you will hear just enough improvement to be pleased with James Gutherie's remastering effort here.  If you are expecting results as dramatic as those on \\"Animals\\" or \\"Meddle,\\" you may be disappointed.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Please view this instructional video before buying:  [...]    I guarantee after watching said video, you will prefer to go to the library and borrow any other version of Star Wars.  And if not, I am very sorry for you.    Lucas apparently now just enjoys trolling the movies that he, ironically, created.  The only additional Noooooos that should be associated with Star Wars are people's reaction to Lucas's changes in this release.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I ordered the movie and it arrived next two days, great copy, I brought mine brand new, had special features and everything, its the real deal!!!....I wasnt to say thanks ;-)
031603441X|5.0|I listened to the audio book - it took a long time, but rarely failed to be fascinating. Keith tells it all - his middle-class childhood, love of music, the start-up and growth of the band, his lengthy, drug-infused affair with Anita Pallenberg, the origins of his difficulties with Mick Jagger, and their still uneven but mutually-dependent relationship. There are many peripheral friends and musical associates - it can be confusing to keep everyone straight, but Keith explains their importance in his life. He doesn't hesitate to describe in grim detail his horrific experiences with drug withdrawal - several times. Listening to Johnny Depp and Keith Richards read alternately was an amazing experience. Keith especially is terrific - he'll chuckle and laugh outright at some of his experiences as he reads; it's as if he were sitting with you chatting. I'll admit some of the ruminations on music composition and performance got a bit tiring for me, but others might enjoy it. Overall, a great listening experience - I don't know if I would have enjoyed the book as much, as hearing Keith's story had a greater intimacy for me, and I wouldn't have missed it for anything!

0307477479|5.0|In a way this book reminded me of David Mitchells \\"Cloud Atlas\\" due to both it's post-modern non-linear structure, and the way the story moves through time. Egan takes it further though, with authorial maneuvers like the much celebrated \\"Powerpoint\\" chapter, which is surprisingly moving. That an author can make the content deadening format of Powerpoint poignant, revealing, and achingly sad is a feat in and of itself. I'm an avid reader with broad tastes, and this book was one of the few that truly surprised and confused me, but in a good way. I enjoy having to think about a story, and Egan makes us read between the lines, draw parallels, and see a story from multiple perspectives and narrative structures. With that said, you might think that this is a lit-geek book that's hard to read, (I'm talking to you David Foster Wallace!) or overly intellectual, but that is not the case at all. It's very readable, her prose is achingly poignant, razor sharp, and keenly insightful...she is able to write about the small things that are really the BIG things. I found myself relating intensely to the ineffable sadness that so many of the characters feel regarding the too-quick passage to time. There were times when I'd re-read a sentence just because it was so dead on, so quirky but weirdly universal that I had to savor it a little bit. There are a few books that I've read where I get to the last page and my first thought is, \\"I need to read that again!\\"  I felt that way with Annie Proulx \\"Heartstrings, every single one of Raymond Carvers works, Cormac McCarthys \\"The Road\\", and David Mitchells \\"Cloud Atlas\\". I have a special place on the bookshelf for these books, so I've made a space for \\"A visit from the Goon Squad\\"....when I need a really good read that I know will be even better the second time, I'll reach for it again.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|simply put, this is a different film, from the theatrical release, and had the butchers allowed Sir Scott to release the film in tact, they would all have been swimming in golden statues. i won't write that the original is not great--it is, but any questions raised, and left unanswered, the first time 'round are all very neatly, and beautifully answered, by the director's cut.  there is nothing i can think of, that would have possibly made this a better film. beautifully executed, with great skill, and craftsmanship.

1582701709|1.0|I did not like this CD, the way different people keep interviewing other people so many names so many different voices is very annoying. The secret, is suppose to be the way we think, according to this CD we bring to ourselves everything bad and good that happened to us with our thoughts, even if is a bad car accident, it is our fault; I do not agree; I do not like this book; it annoys me and, I feel like it was a waste of the money.  I did not learn anything from this CD, and I do not want to listen to it ever again
0061438294|5.0|I have read numerous books on body language, and I always go back to this one. It is easily my favorite. Navarro writes in a way you can both comprehend, remember and utilize. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to learn more on Body Language.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This Paper Camera app is very fun and works well, adding interesting artistic effects to images captured with the phone's camera. The interface is easy to use and includes a a great preview of the image before the picture is taken. Pictures are saved to the phone gallery and can be shared vie email or Facebook. I also like that it does not ask for unreasonable permissions.<br /><br />It installed and runs perfectly on my HTC EVO (Android v2.3.3).<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
0439023521|5.0|This may be a young adult novel, but it's a dead exciting, fast paced, totally gripping novel that I devoured in less than a day. It's set in a brilliantly detailed post-apocalyptic US, now known as Panem. Katniss is a courageous and determined heroine who volunteers to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games - an annual event when a boy and a girl from each of Panem's 12 districts compete to literally be the last contestant standing after all their opponents are dead.<br /><br />The age recommendation on the back of my copy is 11+ years. In terms of reading complexity I would agree with this, but I know my 11 year old son would struggle with the violence and the idea of teens killing one another, so do be aware of the subject matter before you pass it onto a young reader.<br /><br />I highly recommend this as one of my top reads this year. Katniss is a terrific heroine and the future world has been very cleverly thought through. The pace is rapid, the suspense is non-stop and the end is very satisfying.
B005B0QYMM|1.0|Not all that spooky. Less than half the movie in, about every second word is the \\"F\\" word and so much loud arguing between the cast that you start wishing something WOULD happen to all of them.
0439023491|5.0|One advantage of coming to this trilogy late is that I don't have to wait for the next one.  Catching Fire picks up immediately where [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] leaves off (these books MUST be read in sequence).  Katniss is having to come to terms with the impact of her decisions at the end of the previous book - both in terms of her personal life, but also what it means for Panem.<br /><br />It starts a little slowly, but it builds and builds with a couple of twists you won't see coming and you'll be clutching it breathlessly and refusing to stop reading right through to the ending - which will have you desperate to get your hands on volume 3.  In fact, probably best to have [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]] to hand from the get go, because I promise that you will want to read it IMMEDIATELY when you finish this one.<br /><br />I could be harsh and say that Katniss is a bit slow to figure out some things that are blatantly obvious to the reader and also that I'm left with some questions about the motivations of a couple of the characters but overall this series is just so gripping, so original and so compelling that to give it less that 5 stars would be utterly unjust.
B000056NX4|3.0|I really like JC Superstar the movie with Ted Neeley released in '73.  This version of Supertar as a filmed play was very interesting to watch. There are some parts that I hated, other parts that I really liked. For true JC Superstar fans you really should add this to your collection
0385344325|4.0|This book is set when Reacher is still an MP in the Army, but it explains how his army career comes to an end and leads almost directly into the beginning of [[ASIN:B002G7UKBO Killing Floor [KILLING FLOOR] [Mass Market Paperback]]] (including explaining why Reacher will turn up in the same town in Georgia as his brother does).  A young woman has been murdered in a small southern town which is home to an elite Army Ranger training base.  Reacher is sent in undercover to investigate from the civilian side, while another MP is sent into the base.<br /><br />The story unfolds somewhat slowly initially, but develops into an intriguing whodunnit.  Initial clues point towards one suspect, before another set of clues point in an entirely different direction.  Whilst it's apparent that one thread is a giant red herring, the question for the reader is which it will be.<br /><br />Reacher exhibits a disdain for authority and a propensity to use violence as a solution that fits with his behavior in subsequent books, but it does raise the question of how he survived in the Army for as long as he did.  I found some of his actions hard to accept as even remotely likely.  There's an obligatory love interest and the sex scenes are fairly descriptive - more so than usual, and also more so than I'd like.  If Lee Child is trying to tailor to his female fans, this one says \\"less is more, Lee!\\".<br /><br />I did feel it was slightly too easy to guess what the eventual outcome would be, but I still enjoyed it and I'd describe it as a solid Reacher adventure.

I couldn't put it down, and have since found bits and pieces of information in articles in National Geographic and Smithsonian that verify many of his findings.  This is a book that needs to be read by all historians, and major research done to get our history books in line with the facts.

0062112430|5.0|In Delirium, love is considered to be a deadly disease.  In order to get rid of this disease everyone undergoes the procedure to be cured.  If you were suspected to have any symptoms of the disease, you would be severely punished.  Lena is about to turn 18 and the disease hasn't touched her.  She is trying to stay out of trouble and follow the laws until she finishes high school and has the procedure.  Lena believes that once she has the procedure she will be happy and everything will be fine.  Is this really the case?<br /><br />Delirium by Lauren Oliver is another fabulous dystopian novel, book one of a trilogy.  Again, it was a book I couldn't put down!  The idea of love being a disease had me questioning the book before I started to read it.  However, once I started reading I found that Lauren Oliver was able to write about this in a way that makes you think and question if the symptoms could be real.  It was amazing how much you could connect love with a disease in the end.<br /><br />At times I was truly hoping Lena would get the procedure because that seemed to be what she truly wanted and was excited about.  But, in the end I loved how this changed and things started to become complicated for her.  She begins to question not only the society and their laws, but her family as well.<br /><br />The cliffhanger at the end has me pining to read Pandemonium when it comes out in March of 2012!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I don't write reviews but I had to rave about this calendar. It is my favorite &amp; most used app...a must have for those who use several google calendars.  And I love that its for android.
0439023491|5.0|Since there are tons of reviews on this book out there, I will keep it short!<br />Collins has captured me with her writing.  It was another book that I couldn't put down.  The story line and characters continued to captivate me and I fell in love even more with Katniss, Peeta, and Gale.  The story is full of action, love, and drama... all the things that make a book a great read.  There are twists in the story that keep you guessing what will happen and the cliffhanger at the end of the book makes you want more right away!<br /><br />This entire series is a must read for any book lover.
1439152799|4.0|This is the third novel I've ready by Kate Morton.  It took me a bit longer to get into the story but once I did I couldn't read fast enough.  There are so many twists and turns and little mysteries within the mysteries... It was an interesting and compelling read.  I highly recommend it.
0439023521|5.0|I was told to read this book numerous times but I kept putting it off.  Once I decided to start it, I couldn't put it down.  I know this book is somewhat old and there are lots of reviews on it out there.  So, I will keep it somewhat brief.<br /><br />Like I said I couldn't put the book down once I started it, this book was amazing!  I wasn't sure how I would like this type of book, but I loved it.  The book is well written and it draws you in from the very beginning.  I thought the characters were well developed and so was the story line.  The book completely captivates you and makes you feel like you are in the story and can completely empathize with the characters.  There were many times I felt like I was in the action and was feeling what the characters were feeling.<br /><br />This is a must read and will be a book that I will recommend to anyone, young and old.  I was so excited when I found out they were making it into a movie.  I can't wait to see it!
0439023483|5.0|Whenever I hear countless good things about a book I feel almost obligated to either  prove them wrong or join their ranks. With the Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, I  have to agree with the majority that it is an amazing book. I've read others like  it (The Running Man and The Long Walk by Stephen King, The Manhattan Hunt Club by  John Saul, etc) but it is very different in it's own way. The story follows Katniss,  a girl from District 12, who takes the place of her sister to fight for food for  her family, and her life, in the Hunger Games. Two \\"tributes\\" are chosed from Districts  1 through 12 (a boy and girl between ages twelve and eighteen. The older you get,  the chance of your name being chosen grows. There can only be one person left alive  and that person will live in comfort for the rest of their lives including their  family. To Katniss, this is greatly needed especially because in District 12 \\"you  can starve to death in safety.\\" The book is incredible, despite it's being written  in present tense. I usually hate that but it really works with this novel. It is  a bit predictable, but most novels are to some degree. It is worth the time.
0545123275|4.0|Grace and Sam have a love for each other that is impenetrable and they simply belong together.  They have a bond that is so great, its like they have been together forever.  Sam and Grace have to find ways to stay together when winter is upon them and Sam is going to change back into a wolf.  Even though he worries that he might not change back to human form they still stay strong and Grace believes it will work out.<br /><br />Shiver is told in alternating points of view between Grace and Sam.  It was nice to see how their relationship played out in each of their eyes.  Their love and bond even shows when Sam is in wolf form.  It allowed you to connect with their emotions as their love evolved and they struggled to stay together.  Maggie Stiefvater did a great job making you truly connect with each of them.<br /><br />The story is entirely focused on Grace and Sam's relationship.  I didn't mind this, but if you are looking for anything other than a paranormal romance, you might want to look elsewhere.  It was nice to see a romance story without a lot of other drama added on top of it.<br /><br />This was the first time I read Stiefvater's work and I loved it.  She does a great job portraying emotions and character's personalities.  The imagery she paints throughout the story is done beautifully.
0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay is the last book in the Hunger Games series and for me, it was a bit like getting a twenty minute long grand finale in a fireworks display, and then a few remaining bursts of bright and pretty color. In short, good and impressive but it can't stand up next to the first two in my opinion. I think maybe I was spoiled by the game-show feel of the first two. I have a love for game-show novels with Stephen King's The Long Walk being my favorite. This one moved into the relm of revolution and war and went further than the fighting arena. Now adults are involved too and it didn't seem as horrifying to me or interesting.  Please don't get the wrong idea; it is a very good book which concludes the series, but the things I just mentioned along with an occurrence near the end made it not as good for me.
0439023513|5.0|This is the last of The Hunger Games trilogy.  Again, Suzanne Collins did an amazing job writing this book. Katniss continues to struggle with her position as the Mockingjay and role in taking down the capitol.  She questions whether the rebels are going about it the right way or not.  In the end she does what she feels is right.  Katniss also continues to struggle with her feelings toward Gale and Peeta.  Whether its questioning their actions, falling more in love our out of love with them.  In the end she chooses the one that balances her out and that she feels is her best match.<br /><br />Mockingjay continues the story of Katniss, Peeta, and Gale in a way that makes you connect with the story in a way that it keeps you thinking and on your seat.  I continued to fall in love with the characters and kept guessing what they would do next.  This book was a great conclusion to the trilogy.  The story wouldn't be the same without all three of these books and they all flow perfectly together.<br /><br />In the end Suzanne Collins is a brilliant writer.  I would definitely read other works of hers.  This trilogy is a must read for anyone!
0066214122|5.0|Prey is my favorite Michael Crichton novel so far and I would be very happily surprised if any of the books by him that I have not yet read can top this one. It is firmly in the techno-thriller genre but has many elements of good old horror as well. The plot is very original and unpredictable and goes out with a surprising bang unlike most of his books in my opinion. I still think about the swirling clouds of nano particles acting like insects. Some of the scenes where they force themselves inside people are horrifying to me because I find insects terrifying. The book goes through several crazy changes that Crichton effortless guides through with his usual flawless explanations of the nearly possible. I loved the characters and the slow build up of strangeness in the beginning which rapidly speeds up into what feels like a non-stop climax in the plot. Even the ending satisfied me because it brings us full circle back to the brief and chilling introduction.  Prey is excellent and I love every bit of it. It is the only Crichton novel I have read more than once and I enjoy and respect it more each time I do.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|this season of breaking bad is awesome if you haven't saw it yet then it is a must you should buy or rent seasons 1&2 they are great you WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED !
043902353X|5.0|Catching Fire, the second Hunger Games novel, impressed me even more than the first because of the brilliance of the new type of arena that the fight must take place in. I don't want to say what the new style is for fear of getting killed by the one person who for some reason has not read it yet, but take it from me that it is...well... cool. Getting lazy here but that is the best word for it and the entire book. It has the same slightly drawn-out beginning as the first book but I view this as characterization and love it. I can say nothing bad about it and recommend it to anyone who knows how to read. You should probably read the first novel first though.
0553801473|4.0|The trick to enjoying this book is to read as many negative reviews on Amazon as you can stomach.  Then you will go into reading the book thinking it's going to be absolutely awful.  Those low expectations were instrumental in my enjoyment of the book.  For example, based on the reviews, I expected nothing exciting to happen to any of the characters I care about in this book.  I was therefore happy when some of my favorite characters did interesting things (like *spoiler altert*) finally ride a dragon.  Yes, terrible things happen to your favorite characters.  If you haven't figured out that this is a part of reading George RR Martin by now, you're not actually reading his books.  But take heart!  I was sooooo pissed when one of my favorite characters lost her vision in a previous book, but like a good soap opera, she gets it back early in this book.  People died, come back to life, evil characters become likable, likable characters die...that's part of the joy of GRRM.  The other thing that helped me with this book was skimming.  GRRM needs an editor - no question - one who can read him the riot act when he starts reciting the history of minor characters and their lineage (almost as boring as the Begats in the bible).  The trick is to just let your eyes glaze over and quickly flip pages until you skim to some dialogue or interesting action, then start reading again.  Probably thins out 100 pages of the book.  Read in this manner, I felt I had a 4 star experience with this book.  Not bad, considering how much I hated and felt betrayed after A Feast for Crows.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I've never purchased a Tony Bennett CD before, although I am familiar with his music.  This was an impulsive purchase and I have not regretted it.  His voice is still smooth and each of his song partners are more amazing than the next.  From Lady Gaga to Willie Nelson, each artist does not disappoint.

1401307787|5.0|The chapters in this book are very short and profound.  I have gotten into the habit of reading one each day at the beginning of the day.  If you are looking to start or deepen a mindfulness or meditation practice, this book does have some solid practical advice, but I find it most useful as a reminder of the usefulness and benefits of such a practice.  The author's graciously shared worldview and wisdom are great companions in a demanding, hectic world.
B0054N73EY|4.0|After listening to this album I have changed my mind and can say its better then I thought. That being said I do miss John's guitar work. The bass is more prominent on this record which isn't a bad thing either. Over all it's not as good as 2006's double disc set, but still noteworthy.

B0058ZPNOK|4.0|So our central character is vulgar, profane, contemptuous, disgusting, selfish, threatening yet a flicker of direct compassion flares up ever so often. Is it just self-aggrandizing or is our character on route to changing into someone who doesn't always see himself as first and foremost at the expense of others?   These qualities and the environment in which they thrive are clearly written, directed and portrayed in this film thus giving the viewer an easy decision about what is to become of Hesher. Is he worthy of a secular redemption or does he continue on in his own little purgatory?

B003Y5H4Y8|3.0|The Debt (an American remake of a 2007 Israeli film of the same name) is best described as a story on two levels.  On one level, it's a melodramatic espionage thriller that takes places in the 1960's, while on the other, it's a mystery that unfolds thirty years later, one that is centered around the events of the original espionage mission.  The film cuts back and forth between these two story lines, with a different trio of actors portraying the three main characters in each story line.<br /><br />In 1966, a trio of Israeli Mossad agents - Rachel Singer (Jessica Chastain), David Peretz (Sam Worthington) and Stefan Gold (Marton Csokas) - are sent behind the Iron Curtain in East Berlin to kidnap an escaped Nazi war criminal, Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christiansen), the infamous \\"Surgeon of Birkenau\\".  The mission goes awry when, after successfully capturing Vogel, the plan to smuggle him out of East Berlin is disrupted and they are forced to go into hiding while they try to make other arrangements.  It is while he is being held prisoner that Vogel overpowers Rachel and almost escapes, leaving her face grievously scarred in the process.  But Rachel manages to shoot Vogel before he gets away, killing him, and the trio return to Israel as heroes and their mission becomes a Mossad legend.  Later, Rachel and Stefan marry, for reasons that are quite frankly never made clear and end up having a daughter, and David decides to leave.<br /><br />But in the current day (1997) story line, things are more complicated.  Rachel (Helen Mirren) is being honored at a publication party for her daughter Sarah (Romi Aboulafia) who has written a book about her parents' legendary mission.  Already visibly uncomfortable when asked to read a key passage from the book, Rachel becomes even more displeased when Stefan (Tom Wilkinson), now in a wheelchair and from whom she is completely estranged, shows up at the party, a situation clearly set up by Sarah who had told her mother than he wouldn't be there.  At the same time, David (Ciaran Hinds) has also resurfaced, clearly troubled. And we begin to learn that there are cracks in the legend, and ultimately, that the legend is nothing but a self-serving lie that all three have lived with for the last thirty years.<br /><br />I will acknowledge that my reaction to The Debt is in the minority as it was garnered a fair amount of critical praise, but that said, I found myself ultimately disappointed.  I cannot fault the performances of the stellar cast, nor can I really fault the director, John Madden, beyond the pacing problem.  I would probably lay the blame for my overall reaction with the script (the one done for the remake) which was written by Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman.  I have not seen the original Israeli film on which it was based, but in reading the plot summary it appears that some substantial changes were made for this version and that, from what some reviewers say, the original was better.  But that aside, for me the problem with The Debt lies in the fact that it requires some considerable suspensions of disbelief, and that, quite frankly, most of the characters are not particularly likeable or sympathetic.  Stefan is a manipulative, self-centered ladder-climber whose only concerns are his ambitions and his career.  And both Rachel and David are easily manipulated, in addition to forever vacillating in their feelings towards each other, towards Stefan, and inexplicably at times, towards Vogel.  And in their older selves, they have not grown wiser so much as simply worse.<br /><br />The pacing in the beginning is also something of a problem and I actually found myself falling asleep before things finally picked up with the abduction of Vogel. But even when things did pick up, I found myself not really liking it all that much. The characters were so flawed as individuals - and even more flawed as a team - it was difficult to accept the initial premise.  I wouldn't have sent that crew around the corner to pick up a pack of gum, let alone behind the Iron Curtain to kidnap an escaped Nazi.  And the fact that they weren't very sympathetic as individuals made the tepidly melodramatic love triangle subplot more tedious than anything else. I also found it difficult to believe that Vogel would've left Rachel alive before fleeing the apartment.  Or that any competent intelligence officer would've simply accepted their story when they got back.<br /><br />It also says something when the only halfway interesting scenes are the ones with the Nazi doctor, even when written as it is in the The Debt as something of a cliche. For that I'd have to credit the actor - Jesper Christensen - who manages to at least make his repellant doctor fascinating to watch - much like a particularly vicious caged rat - even if you've seen the basic character in countless movies before and the dialogue is just variations on the same old theme.  That Christensen's Vogel, even with the clich&eacute;s, was about the only thing in The Debt worth seeing, says a lot about the rest of the film.  As does the fact that even having Vogel for contrast does not make the ostensible heroes particularly sympathetic.<br /><br />Again, I recognize that my opinion is a minority one.  If you read a review by someone you trust and they say see it, then go ahead.  For myself though, I'd say The Debt is okay if you don't go in expecting much and if you can wade through the ramped-up self-inflicted angst the main characters wallow in for most of the movie.e behind the Iron Curtain to kidnap an escaped Nazi.

B005ELZKWS|5.0|I loved the first Chickenfoot CD.  Loved it a lot. Great CD.  This one is better.  Much better!  The song structure and lyrical composition are both superior.  These are the best, most well constructed lyrics Hagar has even written.  The backing vocals are simply wonderful (VH has got to me missing Mikey).  The rhythem section is way more then solid.  This is simply wonderful, powerful, hard driving rock and roll.  If your fan of rock, there is not a bad song in this collection, front to back, every song is great!  Maybe the worst song is the \\"single\\" Bigfoot (so if you liked that, you'll LOVE the rest of the CD.  The hidden track \\"untitled\\" is maybe one of the best among the songs in this collection.  Buy it...you will not be disappointed!
B004LWZW42|2.0|While a PG-13 movie, I was shocked at the lingerie scene and the large amount of profanity used.  Even a 13 year old or older doesn't need that in a movie.  The story line and special effects were good.  I allowed my 9 year old to watch this movie and regretted not viewing the movie before allowing him to watch it. I nearly turned off the movie primarily due to the profanity.  I didn't like the lingerie scene but that was only a small part of the movie.  The profanity unfortunately persisted throughout.  Needless to say, the movie has been put away and might even be given away.  I wish the writers and directors would leave out the unnecessary trash and just focus on making good movies.  Having excessive cursing, especially use of the f-bomb is just not necessary in any movie, much less a PG-13 movie.

The love story, then ending, the imagery; everything was perfect. I knew I was going to like it after the first few pages, but I had no idea it was going to become my new favorite book. Morgenstern's use of words to describe the the circus made me wish it was real. I almost hope it gets made into a movie just so I can experience it (although I am normally disappointed by movies). Definitely a must read if you like magic, love stories, or just a good book!

1439192812|5.0|I got this both for myself and my almost-five-year-old, knowing the book is intended for slightly older children.  Although I have to explain some of the vocabulary, and it's not a 'cover-to-cover' book for him yet, he does enjoy looking through and asking me about illustrations.  That leads to discussions that start with the material in the book and then leads on wherever his curiosity takes us.  The book was especially well timed in that we read a version of \\"Noah's Ark\\" two days ago in a bookstore.  He's just started asking about this 'God' character, and couldn't get his mind around the idea of 'God' wanting to kill everyone.  He was really interested in the 'Rainbow' story, and I think having an explanation that made sense helped put his mind at ease about the myth version being just a myth.  Now I have to find a set of prisms.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|If you don't like heavily-moralizing Victorian novels, you might still love this movie adaptation. This young director (Cary Joji Fukanaga) is really gifted, and his commentary on the DVD is not to be missed. I've read a lot of the negative reviews here, and without exception they are written by people who admit they adore the novel. Fair play requires that I admit it is probably my second least favorite novel of this genre after Middlemarch. Bronte twists as much sentiment as she can out of Jane's extremely narrow and abusive childhood, yet how bad could it have been given the inviolable force of Jane's character when Rochester meets her, and the moral center she occupies throughout all the novel's conflicts? Yes, there are many motivating bits this film leaves out; but if Bronte's novel as a whole were being held to some standard of psychological realism, Jane should have turned out a bit more like Bertha Mason, Rochester's crazy first wife. What the film leaves in is enough motivation for me: Jane's life and future is constrained by socio-political circumstances beyond her control. She is trapped behind many-mullioned windows when there's any daylight at all in this dark film. Rochester is her only vehicle of escape. Faced with a supercilious rival whom no one can possibly imagine Rochester might admire, Jane is survivor-enough to set her cap for him. But what triumph this match promises is shattered when she finds out she cannot legally become his wife. He is married to the mad woman in the attic. True, I wished the creepy Grace Poole were still in the film, and the confrontation with poor benighted Bertha seems kind of anticlimactic: 21st century viewers see similarly dissheveled street-people in urban America everyday. But for the film, Fukanaga supplies a stunning visual bit when Bertha, being embraced/restrained solicitously by Rochester, lifts her face and spits a fly onto Jane's bosom. I'd agree to cut Grace Poole to keep that bit in. Briefly, I recommend this film because it's handsomely photographed, well-acted, and nicely paced. But if for no other reason, buy the DVD for the director's fascinating commentary.this film because it's handsomely photographed, well-acted, and nicely paced.

She offers tips and advice along with a lot of random things that pop into her head (Never make your bed with a monkey in it). She also suggest ways to live a better life. This is a book for everyone of all ages (shes included  a couple of chapters just for kids) I felt so much better after reading this book. If you like her show(or not) you cant help but like this book. I'd like to find a single person who honestly read the whole book and not laugh at some point. I would recommend this book to everyone. Love it love it love it.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|First off what i mean by good field edge is that the edge you get from this little tiny sharpener is good considering it's meant to be used well outdoors at a camp site and such. Now if you forgot that part the edge is ok, I used it on a Cold Steel recon tanto and got it to slice note book paper to an almost clean manner and had it shaving arm hair but just barely. Now I spent like 5 minutes using it on the knife which isn't bad considering it takes a bit to get a feel for it on the blade.  But over all for how light weight and small this sharpener is, it's really worth the money which as you can see isn't a lot. But remember this isn't meant to make a blades edge to a level of a razor blade or make it really sharp it's meant to bring that edge back to your knife well your out in the field so you can get back to working with it.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I have been waiting FOR FOREVER to read this book. Now that I finally have, I am not at all disappointed. I do admit that the series as a whole starts off slowly. The Lost Hero did not draw me in as much as I hoped it would. The Son of Neptune scores much much higher in that department. All the humor that I enjoyed so much in the original Percy Jackson series is back. I now cannot wait until next year to read The Mark of Athena. I totally recommend this book to everybody!!!!!

It was hard to follow, and the teenage Japanese girl was just too hard to take.

Jean Reno is a great actor but this was not one of the good ones.
B003BKZW40|5.0|It is not hard for any Stephen King fan to recognize the Bachman books as Stephen King writing under an alias.  The Bachman books are just as satisfying as any King book with lots of suspense, gore, mystery and supernatural phenomenon that every King fan expects and wants.  I collect all King's books, and they sit on the shelf right below my collection of literary classics. For a horror thriller, I always choose King.  I don't need to read reviews.  I know what I'm buying when I buy a King book, and he never fails to satisfy.
0440246008|4.0|Lee Child's Jack Reacher series on audio books has become our go-to series when taking a long car trip.  Book number ten, The Hard Way, provides Child's usual dose of mystery, action and suspense.<br /><br />Jack Reacher finds himself in the same coffee shop in New York City two days in a row, something very unusual for the former MP who is now a vagabond.  It turns out that on his first morning in the coffee shop, he witnessed a man walk to a car across the street from the shop, open up the car and drive away.  He learns the next day that the man he saw was a kidnapper, making off with the ransom money.  Edward Lane, former Special Forces, now runs a mercenary company, and his wife and step-daughter have been kidnapped.  His first wife was also kidnapped, and later found dead.  He hires Reacher to make sure that the end result is more favorable.  The more Reacher learns about Lane, the more he realizes that Lane is an evil man.  Plus, it appears that Lane may have actually had his first wife kidnapped and murdered because she wanted a divorce.  Just when Reacher finally figures out what is really happening, he makes one of the biggest mistakes he has ever made in his life.  Things will play out at a rural farm in England in one of the best show-downs of any Reacher novel.<br /><br />In The Hard Way, Reacher hooks up with former FBI-agent Lauren Pauling, who now runs her own private investigative firm.  Pauling was on the case of the kidnapping of Lane's first wife, and she has never forgiven herself for not solving this one before the first Mrs. Lane was killed.  It's a good thing she joined forces with Reacher, as she has things that Reacher lacks--like a driver's license and money.  But the love-angle is a stretch.  First, Pauling is about 10 years older than Reacher and also, I fail to see how Pauling can fall into bed with someone who doesn't change clothes for days at a time.  Also, while Dick Hill does a wonderful job in narrating these books, one character in The Hard Way is impossible to understand and he has a lot of dialogue.<br /><br />But overall, The Hard Way is a strong effort that will keep you guessing.  We're looking forward to book number 11, Bad Luck and Trouble, for our return trip.impossible to understand and he has a lot of dialogue.

The plot is new and unique from books written prior by Rick Riordan, yet ties in nicely with the world he created for Percy Jackson & the Olympians. It kept me wondering and guessing, on the edge of my seat, turning page after page, wanting to hear more. And best yet, the adventure doesn't end after you finish this book.

0670022950|5.0|In his lauded but controversial best-seller \\"[[ASIN:0142003344 The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature]]\\", Steven Pinker set out to quash a romanticized nostalgia for the lifestyle of people in pre-state societies: the myth of the \\"noble savage\\". Now, in his new book \\"The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined\\", Steven Pinker extends this rectification of prevailing but misguided opinion to grand scale, presenting a strong case for our ennobled present; we are living in the most peaceful era humanity has ever known.<br /><br />Pinker blows the reader away (forgive the violent metaphor) with sheer weight of analytical shot. At 700 pages of text interspersed with graphs and heaps of reference data, \\"Better Angels\\" is thorough-going and methodical because it has to be; contradicting common folk theories (like the noble savage), overriding an often overwhelming sense of unceasing or imminent violence from media coverage (see compassion fatigue), and compensating for a general lack of statistical thinking and probabilistic understanding in the lay public is no easy task. People are right to be skeptical of controversial theories, and knowing this Pinker has patiently lain it all out for us to see for ourselves that violence truly has declined with clear and unambiguously downward direction.<br /><br />\\"Better Angels\\" is structured around an inventory of six Trends, five Inner Demons with four Better Angels, and five Historical Forces (Pinker can't help but enumerate). More than half of the book is dedicated to a chronological exploration of the Trends of our history, six paradigm shifts in the human condition: The Pacification Process, The Civilizing Process, The Humanitarian Revolution, The Long Peace, The New Peace, and The Rights Revolutions. The bulk of the remaining half of the text is a fascinating look at psychology and sociology, showcasing a combined total of nine human traits (the Better Angels & Inner Demons) that dictate our behavior depending on their interplay with our environment and circumstance. The last five items in Pinker's syllabus, the five Historical Forces, feature in the concluding chapter and encapsulate much of the book's overall content by reflecting combinations of historical trend and human trait.<br /><br />The Five Major Historical Forces for Peace:<br /><br />  The Leviathan (the state; reigns in internal violence)<br />  Gentle Commerce (economic incentives for cooperation)<br />  Feminization (empowerment of women; men are naturally more violent)<br />  The Expanding Circle (empathy; sympathizing with ever wider classes)<br />  The Escalator of Reason (rationality; application of empathy)<br /><br />A few minor quibbles with value judgments aside, \\"The Better Angels of Our Nature\\" assiduously justifies its subtitular contention: violence really has declined, and now it's not so hard to see why. Steven Pinker has assembled vast quantities of data to support his position, sourced in turn by the assemblies of other preeminent scholars in ethnography, anthropology, and the history of man. Add to this a trove of lab-tested social psychology, game theory, and the areas of Pinker's own expertise in cognitive psychology. The resulting dissertation, structured with the incredible skill and forethought that define Steven Pinker's books, sums these component analyses into the rational juggernaut needed to upend the conventional wisdom it is up against. Though consistently dispassionate in tone and bearing throughout, the title of this book betrays its emotional impact: optimism for humanity.interplay with our environment and circumstance. The last five items in Pinker's syllabus, the five Historical Forces, feature in the concluding chapter and encapsulate much of the book's overall content by reflecting combinations of historical trend and human trait.

The resulting dissertation, structured with the incredible skill and forethought that define Steven Pinker's books, sums these component analyses into the rational juggernaut needed to upend the conventional wisdom it is up against. Though consistently dispassionate in tone and bearing throughout, the title of this book betrays its emotional impact: optimism for humanity.

The directions include a solid tools and materials list so that you know exactly what you need to create each of the bead types. It covers color blending of the clay, adding inclusions and foils, impressions and patterns. If you really want to take your polymer clay work to the next level, each of the small projects that you perform for each technique will definitely provide you with the skills to succeed.
0525423281|3.0|I am a huge fan of the book Anna and the French Kiss, so I pre-ordered this book with high expectations.  I was not disappointed.  Stephanie Perkins is an awesome writer who is able to reveal the conflicting and irrational emotions of being in love in a vibrant and enthusiastic way that keeps the reader captivated until the final pages.  Lola is the biological daughter of two messed up 16 year olds.  She is raised by the homosexual brother and his partner of her alcoholic mother.  She has been in love with the boy next door since she was five, but 2 summers ago, he broke her heart then moved away and she has tried to move on.  Lola has always been a unique dresser by having a different \\"costume\\" (which includes wigs and themes) each day.  She has just turned 17 and is dating a 22 year old rock musician and thinks she is happy.  Then Cricket, the boy next door that she was in love with and who hurt her deeply, comes back into her life, and she is a confused mess.  The great surprise of this book is that both Anna and St. Clair are in this book prominently. They don't just show up for a cameo, but are major characters in the story.  I love seeing them again.  Perkins's characters are wonderfully unique and are filled with the uncertainty, anger, and desire typical of the hormonally charged teenager that feels everything so earnestly.  She captures the frustration and delight of falling in love and the confusion of love and its consequences.  She also describes Lola's world of hurt and anger and her reactions to it both physically and emotionally.  Despite loving the fictional aspects of this well written story, the real life depictions of a girl being raised by two gay men, dating a tattooed older MAN who is a rock musician, having a drugged mother and homeless father, and dressing in costumes so that \\"she\\" isn't revealed, is messed-up.  Psychologically and emotionally this girl is hurting and making bad choices that cannot just be summed-up to being a teenager.  There is so much abnormal behavior going on here that apparently is intended to be understood as normal and maybe even healthy because it ends well.  Hopefully, the YA crowd to whom this is directed will be able to see the pain and anger for what and who it really is and understand the improbability of this story ending with the \\"happily ever after\\" it seems to imply.  As a work of fiction, this story is entertaining, as a work of true-life; it is heartbreaking.   Would I/Did I buy it? Yes  Would I read it again? No  Would I recommend it to friends? Sure
B000006TRV|5.0|I tend to ignore the concept and listen to the music, the best of which was co-written between Waters and Gilmore...Why did RW think he was the only light in the band?
B001CQONKY|4.0|What a great season, but something must have happened in transit. During the first disc, there is a critical time with critical scenes where the disc simply freezes for a few minutes and then starts up over 5 minutes later. Later, on the same disc, it has a few areas that it freezes for a few seconds, while disconcerting, you really don't miss anything.I've tried cleaning the disc and while it helps a little, it still leaves the scene where Grissom proposes and more out. NOT GOOD! I could be considered an almost automatic 5 Star guy,... Not with this one!  That review is for this shipment.   Review for the Season, superbly written and acted. The writing and acting of losing both Sarah and Warrick was well played. If I could personally thank the CSI crew for the entertainment, I surely would!

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I RESEARCHED THE X41s ALONG WITH TRITTON AND OTHER TURTLE BEACH MODELS. WHAT SOLD ME ON THE TURTLE BEACH X41s WAS THE WIRELESS RF CONNECTION, THE DOLBY 7.1, AND THE ABILITY TO HEAR MYSELF TALK BACK INTO THE HEADSET (SO I WASN'T SCREAMING).  IT WAS A CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT FOR SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A HEADSET ($133 FOR THE HEADSET AND ADAPTER FOR THE FIBER OPTIC CONNECTION).  BUT I QUICKLY DIDN'T CARE AFTER THE FIRST 5 SECONDS OF USING IT.  IT CONNECTED EASILY TO EVERYTHING. THE SOUND IS NOTHING SHORT OF STELLAR. THE BASE BOOST IS WONDERFUL. THE OVERALL SOUND IS RICH AND DYNAMIC. THE VOLUME CONTROLS ARE RESPONSIVE. THE MIC IS SENSITIVE AND PICKS UP ON MY VOICE EASILY AN PERFECTLY. I HAVE A WIFE AND BABY AT HOME AND NEED TO WATCH MY VOICE LEVEL AT NIGHT. I CAN HEAR MYSELF WELL AND SO CAN MY TEAM MATES. THE SOUND CAPABILITIES ARE INDESCRIBABLE. I CAN HEAR THE SLIGHTEST FOOTSTEPS AND MOVEMENT AROUND ME. MY KILL/DEATH RATIO HAS IMPROVED TREMENDOUSLY BECAUSE I CAN HEAR THEM COMING BEFORE THEY EVEN SEE ME!! IT'S ALMOST UNFAIR TO THE COMPETITION. I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN WITHOUT FAIL. AND TELL ANYONE I COULD TO DO THE SAME. IF YOUR ON THE FENCE AT ALL...JUMP THE HELL OFF AND BUY THE HEADSET!!! I GUARANTEE YOU WON'T REGRET IT! KUDOS TO TURTLE BEACH

B000HBK06Q|4.0|Blade Runner is a classic science fiction movie that, despite it's age, seems to be timeless and is better appreciated now by the general public than when it was originally made in 1982.     'Blade Runners' are special police operatives who track down 'replicants' (robots that are indistinguishable from humans) that are living on earth illegally.   The movie is set in a futuristic Los Angeles. It features great production designs and Harrison Ford in the lead role. Well worth watching!
048622709X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:476ac61913c9540c662d3b3b2f50694a]] I bought this book after previously purchasing Bridgman's [[ASIN:B002VL4OC6 Constructive Anatomy [Paperback]]], and I've been extremely pleased with both.  This book features work by an artist I grew to trust during my years at art school (and still reference as a professional).  The book features pages full of hand sketches in various poses and stages of completion.  The anatomy is near flawless and the sketchiness is well preserved.  I did not think it was too medical in its approach as anatomical flavoured books often are.  I found it easier to draw from these sketches than a photo, since so much is already interpreted for you. So if you're having troubles on your overall form and silhouette and/or need to brush up on your anatomy, this book is a superb (and cheap) resource.  I recommend buying [[ASIN:0486459144 The Best of Bridgman: Boxed Set (Boxed Sets/Bindups)]], you get The Book of a Hundred Hands, plus Bridgman's Life Drawing & Heads, Features and Faces.  I bought them separately over time, but wish I'd just have gotten them all at once.
B001U0HAZM|5.0|This is undoubtedly a great thriller movie!! The Bale's performance is outstanding!!<br />The movie presents a thriller a history involving madness and hallucination.
B0053TMP24|4.0|SPOILER ---<br /><br />I really hope that the delay of the ebook in US and all the typos in the kindle version and mis-handling in the book version (as reflect by one reviewer) is not a result of the chaos created by the un-deaded Queen Otrera.<br /><br />The second book expanded on the story with two more exciting demigods each with unique abilities and backgrounds. More romance, even Tyson got hitch! As usual the author manage to weave ancient myth with modern social phenomena with touch of humor, ROFL and Amazons! References back to previous books in the Olympian series creates a linkage.<br /><br />But I am concern with the pace of the book, it does seem rush and the story arc fairly linear. I would like more description of the eight month of inactivity of Percy rather than a few paragraphs of training under the wolfs. And apparently the wolf is able to isolate the training of Percy and Frank during that time? The last battle of rome seems like an anti-climax, with the eagle standard doing armageddon to the monster.<br /><br />There are a few gaps that I hope will be answer in the subsequent book like how is Nico able to know about the Pluto side when he is the son of Hades? Does the pact of the 3 elder gods not extended after death? How is hazel and frank managed to kill the eldest son of Gaea without the help of a God (Death is close by but apparently did not help out like Terminus) or is he the exception because of his exclusive domain clause?<br /><br />P.S. I really hope that there will be a updated version of the kindle version to fix the editing.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|I have not seen all of the DVD yet but it is an excellent story and the Blueray is very high quality.

B004EPZ00W|4.0|This is the story of Billy Beane, the Oakland A's GM who built his team based on statistics rather the traditional player evaluation process.  The film is not just a baseball movie but is a drama about a man who bucks the usual way of doing business in his chosen industry, and juggles his professional life with his personal life. He is close to his daughter, and the time and pressure of Major League Baseball make it difficult to find time for her. The presence of Brad Pitt elevates this project and he is very good as the man who takes a unique way of putting together a team. Knowing the final outcome does not damper the viewer's enthusiasm in following the progress of the ballclub.
B005NPBT5M|5.0|I picked this up at Best Buy when I was off to recycle a busted laptop, and stuck it in my car's stereo on the way back. Seeing as I wasn't going to be born for another six years when the album came out, this was the first time I was able to listen to it all the way through (I had previously heard Another Brick In The Wall (Part II) and Hey You), and it did not disappoint.  Listening to it was an experience. The music was enjoyable, but it gave me the sensation of being slightly high and slightly ill. Always fun. Still, it was an extremely enjoyable album
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|A former boxer takes the young son he abandoned long ago as he becomes involved in the shadowy world of underground robot boxing. They find an old sparring robot and they are able to get an opportunity to put him in a professional match. The film climaxes with a fight against the mightiest boxing robot in the world. During this adventure, the boxer develops a relationship with the boy that he never knew. This is a delightful film about an underdog trying to achieve the unexpected, and also about a man becoming a father to his growing son. The way the film was scored really adds to the inspirational theme and the characters are more than just backdrops for the fighting. It contains elements that appeal to all demographics. This is a terrific movie that the whole family will enjoy.
B004DR9OGC|4.0|This 3 part BBC adaptation of the Anne Bronte novel runs 160 minutes<br />total.<br /><br />Nicely shot, with a lot of surprisingly modern camera techniques for a<br />Bronte novel. Usually this works well, although occasionally it gets<br />self conscious (a couple too many 360 shots).<br /><br />The acting is solid, with Tara Fitzgerald an edgy but still empathetic<br />heroine. But Rupert Graves' switch from flawless seducer to \\"worst man<br />in the world\\" type villain is a bit over the top, although that may be<br />the material, or approach more than performance. Indeed, at times I<br />could feel Graves (a very good actor) trying to maintain some humanity<br />under the almost Gothic heartlessness.<br /><br />The music is interesting and effectively anachronistic as well, often<br />sounding something the Cocteau Twins, but as with the cinematography<br />after a while it starts to get both repetitive and too self consciously<br />avant-garde for a story mostly told in a straightforward Masterpiece<br />Theater fashion.<br /><br />Lastly, the tidy ending bothered me a bit. The film did a good enough<br />job capturing the complex difficulties of life, that I found myself<br />wish for something that felt more honestly open ended.<br /><br />All that said, I still enjoyed the story, the scenery, and being<br />transported into another time and place as only good storytelling can<br />do. A quite good adaptation, I just wished it was great, and for 30<br />minutes or so, thought it might be.
B0034G4P94|5.0|Two brothers and their recovering alcoholic father are the focus of this film. One is a high school physics teacher who is about to lose his home to foreclosure. The other is an Iraq war hero who deserted his unit. The father tries to repair his relationship with the two sons as the relationship between the three is strained. Both brothers sign up for a championship MMA match in order to claim a 5M dollar prize. In the finale, the two compete against each other for the title. This is more than just a sports movie as the film focuses on the relationships between the characters and the MMA is merely a backdrop for the storyline. The fight scenes are terrific, making this movie a good sell for both fans of sport as well as those who want to see a quality film.
B00457X7XQ|4.0|I've been a fan of Mark's since the early days of SysInternals. I knew his reputation as a technical person, and a technical writer.    I bought Zero Day (my first Kindle e-book purchase) with a little bit of hesitation.   I'm a Stephen King/Dean Koontz/Jeffrey Deaver/Tom Clancy fan, so I'm used to a good thriller novel, and I was not necessarily convinced that Mark's technical skills could translate into a good novel.   Well, I was pleasantly surprised. As a techie, I appreciated the detail and technical aspects, but I think even non-techies would enjoy the ride.  A great read, it really makes you think about what could (does) happen. I only put it down to go and deploy patches and harden the company firewall :)  Some headlines I read today made me stop and think \\"wow, it really CAN happen\\"!  I highly recommend it, and looking forward to the next one.  Steve
0307476154|5.0|I found The Girl who Played with Fire somewhat better than the first of the trilogy.

0470876417|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a SBA staff person as background for a Business Course I will be teaching for Veterans looking to start their own business.  A precursor class to learning to do a business plan.  The books engages and informs about the business models for the new and brightest businesses, along with other models that while new and strong, may never reach the fame of a Google or Apple.  It is one of the first business books that my kids have come in and wanted to read, since it involves brands they know and trust (Apple, Google, Amazon...)  An excellent book for those that want to know how to (re)create a business to excel in times of change.
B004R10L4S|1.0|I think that the leak of Valerie Plame was horrible.  And yet, watching this movie, what little I knew seemed highly misrepresentative.  The characterization portrayed by the actors for the White House correspondent (Ari Fleischer?) and Karl Rove were way off.  Made me think the way Scooter Libby was characterized was also extremely biased.  Also, knowing that Sean Penn is a liberal made me think it was biased.  George Clooney, who is also a liberal, managed to produce a much more thought-provoking movie, the American.  This felt like a bad Monday night ABC special movie.
1423140591|5.0|This was ordered as a gift for my daughter. It was supposed to come with a gift card for her. The book she loves and she was thrilled to get it, but I was not thrilled to have to tell her who it was from because they failed to add the gift card to it. This has happened on many occasions and I think Amazon should fix that problem.

B004DMNT2W|5.0|This little case allows our Canon camcorder to fit snugly inside, protected.  I purchased it for its small, slim profile so the camcorder would be protected without the bulkiness of our other large bag which holds extra batteries and cords.  Its perfect for this use. A side benefit is that the case with camcorder inside will fit into the larger camera bag, ready to pull out and use at a moment's notice. Also, if arranged, lens down, it can be charged while inside.  I highly recommend this well-made case for use when you don't want to carry around all the extra gear but need protection for your device.

1402760663|5.0|Having worked my way (slowly) through Dee Brown's Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee [Illustrated 2009] I was struck with the overwhelming feeling that we (whites) have done such wicked things in the past that any ability to discern and comment from a feigned position of innocence has been fully compromised. I may think I can recognize evil in others, but unless I can see it in myself, I am totally deluded. I also recognized the feeling is it was a complete travesty for the United States to have found the Nazis guilty of crimes against humanity without having convicted themselves of the same monstrosities during the Indian Wars. It is ludicrous that we should fail to see the parallels between them.<br /><br />Historically, there were persons alive at the end of World War II who experienced and remembered the virtual extermination of their race in the 1890's, as well as a number of living war criminals who were never brought to justice. The United States handed out sentences at Nuremberg with an air of self-righteousness totally without any recognition of our own guilt less than 50 years before. The excerpt from Teddy Roosevelt's The Winning of the West demonstrates the hubris and self deception which served to justify US imperialism during his presidency and US foreign policy of the 20th century. To find the German people guilty of heinous crimes and feel compelled to punish them, without dispensing the same 'justice' on ourselves was not only hypocritical, it was delusional. I am not saying that following military orders is improper. Obedience to orders is the basis of command responsibility. However, it was very apparent that numerous crimes against Native Americans, just like the Jews and gypsies were committed by civilians without any possible claim of respondeat superior.<br /><br />I am convinced that ongoing process which is restoring the wealth stolen by the Nazis from the victims of the Second World War is also applicable to First Nation People. Acting as though the statue of limitation has run out on either is a failure to acknowledge the truth. As malleable as that statement is, we still should feel compelled to an honest accounting and dialog with the victims and their children. I do not expect that either side can fully appreciate what was done, but until each party has had their say in transparent, open and honest forum, the wounds of genocide are unlikely to heal.<br /><br />We have a collective responsibility not to hide behind our mythical history of the victors and act as though the end justified the means. We still have much reckoning to do when it comes to the Indian Wars and the Second World War treatment of the Germans and Japanese and their (and our) respective treatment of the Jews and the Indochinese. To the victor, go the spoils (Victori Spolia) or winner takes all, only works when you don't cheat.ation has run out on either is a failure to acknowledge the truth.

B004RJMUJO|3.0|The production on this game is great. Looks good, sounds good. However, the gameplay itself get pretty boring very quickly. It's not much of a puzzle, so it's really just about how good you can swipe your finger across the screen. It's fine for short spurts, but ultimately I found it so be little more than a pretty tech demo.
159420229X|4.0|An interesting book as it details how the author's journey to remembering was implemented. Not a lot of how to details,however, I did refresh some of the things I have utilized in the past and it was  fun to read his journey and be able to put some ideas into use.  A good read but not a lot of how to in detail,however, I do not think that was the intent to give us a step by step process.

B003UESJH4|5.0|My initial expectations of The King's Speech were influenced by the impressive cast. I assumed that with Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush I would be guaranteed some quality entertainment. What an understatement! I was completely blown away by this film!  At the core of the movie is that the King has a speech impediment, and an Australian is tasked with trying to resolve it. It is indeed a point of some pride for me that an Aussie was a pioneer in speech pathology.  With the outbreak of WWII fast approaching it's imperative that the King, who unexpectedly finds himself on the throne, provides the people of Britain and the British Empire with confidence, and his verbal communication is where this assurance must start from.

B002VECM4A|4.0|From the first minute to the very last Precious is a confronting film. The narrative contains abuse, incest, and poverty, yet amongst all this utter misfortune is a young women named Precious who wants to make the best of her life. She often uses daydreams to escape the harsh realities of her being, and she has a warm good nature. A scene in the movie that is priceless is when Precious introduces John the male nurse (Lenny Kravitz) to the school receptionist, who is constantly frustrated by relationships, and she drops the phone the moment she lays eyes on John. But make no mistake this is a hard hitting film with no rainbows.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B003V5HWWA|1.0|I was so happy to see this come up on the top list of my tivo download options, as the original hasn't been available for quite awhile.  All it says is \\"Aladdin\\" when you look at it as a thumbnail, and the cover looks just like the original.  Luckily there was a confirmation screen that showed the full title before I paid for it. I'm not interested in watching some crappy sequel.   Very misleading icon.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Clint Eastwood has cemented his role as one of the best story tellers in Hollywood right now. See other reviews for a synopsis of this movie. If you love good old-fashion Hollywood story telling, this movie is for you. In many ways, Star Wars killed story in movies. George Lucas stated once that if you keep the story moving fast enough, the audience will not question the plausibility of the events. He meant that if the pace is quick, no one will question the logic of the story line. Eastwood's Hereafter returns the story to pre-Star Wars Hollywood, the late sixties and early seventies, when most studio executives had book publishing roots. Most studio executives today have MBAs and law degrees. And most repeat the successes of other movies. Any movie that elevates the story to pre-Star Wars Hollywood, gets an automatic \\"A\\" in my book. This is a great story that progresses logically. You become interested in the characters and the story. Great movie. I hope other examples follow.

B004ZNAGNE|5.0|Pink Floyd's Dark Side of The Moon has always been a very different sounding album to me, more than any other I have ever owned. This is one of very few album's or artist's that can make my eyes roll to the back of my head, but DSOM can do it over and over again in many different passages. A gourgeous friend of mine let me hear it when we where both around 14 years old she gave it to me with her picture in one of the pages of the book. I have always been really big on music! I use it to pinpoint exact times in my life and no matter where my life has taken me good or bad music was always there for me and just being able to sit alone and still for a bit listening to my favorite artists is something very special and important to me these days. This is the 4th time I have bought this CD because for some reason it keeps vanishing throughout the years. I was going to re buy it a few months ago when I saw that this remastered edition was going to be released. So I waited and I am so happy with the audio quality of this release. Im no audiophile Im thinking I just may be a little fanatical when it comes to HT but in my home I have a audio setup consisting of a 9.4 setup of a Onkyo 5008 a Emotiva XPA-5 amplifier, 4 Mythos STS's towers, 4 Mythos Gem XL's, 4 Super cube Reference sub woofers and a Oppo blu-ray player as my main CD player witch sounds better than my PS3 when playing music or movies. I also have over $2,000 of acoustic panels and bass traps in my room. With the Onkyo and the Emotiva together they pump out around 2,300 watts to my 9 speakers and with the 4 Super cube Refs and built in amps in the Mythos STS's I have a total of 8,400 watts of powered subs. So my point here is audio is very important to me. So on to the CD, I don't have to describe the music since we all already know how it sounds If I did that I would be typing here for ever about all the things I love in this album and what it means to me, so I will describe the sound. It is the clearest I have heard pink floyd sound so far, the volume of the voice is great compared to the music, Although in my opinion I wish it was just a little bit more pronounced and maybe a notch or 2 louder. Bass is nice full and sometimes visceral which is nice since allot of my older music lacks good deep or powerful bass with very few exceptions. But the most important thing to me of all is it has almost zero hiss in the background which irritates the hell out of me if I can hear it in the background when the music is playing. The only time you hear any hiss in the background is in between tracks but never while the music is playing no matter how loud I turned it up. Now on to the live album, I have never really been a big fan of or listend to a lot of live music but I was amazed at how good the audio quality of the live album sounded. The live album easily rivaled the audio of the CD, and that notch or 2 I wished for earlier in the voice was present in the live version. The bass was even more powerful and visceral than the remastered studio album. I guarantee those who love live music will love this live album. I do prefer the Regular CD over the live version I think because I grew up listening to the Regular version of DSOM. If you love floyd and are looking for the best sounding version of DSOM this is a must have. I give the audio 5 stars and of course the DSOM Album gets another 5 stars. The other thing I would have liked is if the Cd's where in a plastic case instead of the paper case it comes in. I am just hoping it doesn't get scratched taking it in and out of that case. Hey wait a minute!!!! I still have my empty DSOM case that the disc somehow vanished in wooooo hoooo!!!ard pink floyd sound so far, the volume of the voice is great compared to the music, Although in my opinion I wish it was just a little bit more pronounced and maybe a notch or 2 louder.

The other thing I would have liked is if the Cd's where in a plastic case instead of the paper case it comes in. I am just hoping it doesn't get scratched taking it in and out of that case. Hey wait a minute!!!! I still have my empty DSOM case that the disc somehow vanished in wooooo hoooo!!!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've tried several and this is the best by far. Many versions, including ESV, NET, TEV (my favs). Some can be downloaded, all can be accessed on line  Notes, bookmarking, audio stream, and community forums. Great website for your desktop computer. Registration with the website (in app or on web) may be necessary (I did but can't recall if it was required) BEST.

B003L77G2Y|3.0|The first two years of Fringe was one of the best series ever! Great characters, great scripts, we loved it. Like so many, it has lost its way, and that is too bad. The cartoon episode was the dumbest thing I've ever seen. A couple of the episodes were true to the first two years, but overall, just ok.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Finally got a free app with no shady permissions so I finally get to rate one based on my usage.  Works flawlessly with Vibrant with Froyo (still in jail).  Lets you choose from multiple styles which are all clearly different from one another. From within each style, you can choose to add or remove the number of lines, and/or increase or decrease brightness, and/or oncrease or decrease saturation.   Shares well with SMS and Facebook.  Really fun to walk around in a the &quot;Take on Me&quot; commercial lol  Great app! Well worth the cash!

B001AXOFS4|4.0|did not pay too much attention to adele until i heard her stunning 21 cd.  it made me an instant fan and naturally made me go back to her no less than stunning debut.  the record is on a less than equal footing with 21 but nonetheless superb, particularly my favorite tracks, make you feel feel my love, tired, chasing pavements and cold shoulder.<br />the bonus live disc is just the perfect icing on the cake.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I'm really enjoying the effects this app gives me. It runs great on the Thunderbolt; I think a lot of the low rating people should consider upgrading their phone.
0307277887|4.0|Let me start by saying that when I started reading this series, I had not watched the TV show that they are based on. When TV shows or movies are based on a book or series of books, I always prefer to read the book before seeing the show or movie. I can honestly say that for this series, I enjoyed both.<br /><br />In Darkly Dreaming Dexter, we are introduced to our protagonist when he is at his happy slashing best.  We are given some background into who Dexter is and more importantly, why he is the way he is.  His adoptive father Harry is a cop who realizes when Dexter is a teenager that there is something different about him.  Dexter is a serial killer!  Realizing that he will never be able to change Dexter, Harry instead crafts a serial killer code that Dexter must live by.  Instead of running amok around the city of Miami, Dexter takes care of those who have escaped justice at the hands of the law.<br /><br />How does Dexter get away with being a serial killer?  Well on top of being trained by a cop, Dexter himself is a blood splatter analyst with the police department.  Who better than to get away with murder than someone who spends his days investigating them?  Joined by his adopted sister Deborah, who is also a cop, Dexter begins investigating a peculiar series of murders.  Sooner rather than later Dexter begins to feel a certain affinity with his fellow artist.<br /><br />Dexter really is the best anti-hero I have ever read about.  I find myself, despite knowing that I probably shouldn't, always rooting for him.  That is what is really special about this character.  You know he is a killer.  You know killing is wrong, no matter the reason.  Somehow though, Jeff Lindsay has managed to create a character in Dexter that despite all of his perversion and murder, is just downright likeable.  Dexter's sometimes bumbling attempts to fit in and appear normal are a large part of his appeal.  He admits things in his inner monologue's that no one else would ever consider, and trust me, it's not just confined to the killing.<br /><br />On it's own, the book is great. It is not laugh out loud funny, but gave me more than a few laughs with Dexter's dry sarcastic wit and macabre sense of humor.  The plot moved along well, and Jeff Lindsay really found the perfect balance between past/present; giving some very good insight into Dexter's character. I must say that I was surprised by the ending, and that is not something that happens often.st confined to the killing.  On it's own, the book is great.

B00466HN86|5.0|A group of police officers in a small Southern town form a tight bond of friendship both on and off the job.  Together with their new pal, a struggling construction worker, they resolve to become better fathers after one of them suffers a tragic loss.<br /><br />I was very impressed by this movie which is all about men having the courage to do the right thing for their families and their jobs, as well.  Most of the actors are non-professionals and members of the same church; they are uniformly excellent.  The script is well-written with intense drama and a few light-hearted moments as well.  We get to know and care about each of the men as they deal with loss,  unemployment, gangs, whistle-blowing at work, and above all, their wives and children.<br /><br />This is an inspiring movie that moved me to tears many times.  If you liked, \\"Fireproof\\" (produced by the same church), you will love it.  There is no profanity or suggestive material, just  wholesome entertainment with a message. Recommended.
B0038M61BE|5.0|Something about this CD makes me want to play it over and over again.  It is both soothing and uplifting.  I've bought other Art Pepper CDs without having this effect.  It is my favorite saxophone  jazz record of all time.  I originally read about it in an essay  by Terry Castle which actually talked about Pepper's ongoing problems with heroin.  He's been dead a long time but this a great legacy.

0767903862|4.0|I'm an Australian living in Los Angeles and whenever I hear of a friend planning to visit \\"the old country\\" I buy them a copy of this book. It's a fun read (I must read it again myself!) and  great preparation for their trip. Bill Bryson is easy to read and maybe it's his years spent living in UK but he seems to have developed an Australian-style sense of humour (Australian, British - we all sound alike to you!) which makes this book an even better introduction to the Sunburned Country.
B0002O06N0|5.0|I don't write too many reviews but I felt the need to for this one. I'm a classic rock type guy and the first time I heard this album it blew me away. I first heard these guys playing in the background at a party and the music immediately stood out to me. Finally. Something refreshing in music. If you like blues and classic rock PICK THIS UP. This album brought back great music. Personal favs are 10am automatic, Girl on my mind, and Stack shot billy but every song is unbelievable. Not one downer.

031261246X|5.0|This is a great book!  It moves well, is quite accurate about what could happen, and really makes you think about how you are protecting YOUR computer and online data.  It's not all boring computer terms, it's well written for anyone who likes a good adventure story.  But if you are a geek/nerd, this is something you can relate to and will thoroughly enjoy.<br /><br />And for those who don't know, Mark Russinovich knows his way around computers EXTREMELY well!  His company was bought by Microsoft because of all the great things he wrote for solving problems and making Windows run better.  He definitely knows what is possible and what isn't!  If you're interested in his tools go to [...] - his old company that redirects to the Microsoft site, I just can't ever remember that link.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this, you won't be sorry!
1423140591|5.0|I was so happy then this book came out.  I really wanted to find out what happen to Percy.  I love the Roman camp, and I can't wait to see where this is going to go. Just like in the Lost Hero; Mr Rick Riordan really keeps you wraped up in the story that it is hard to put down.  I love the fact that you don't really have to have read The Olympians to enjoy this book but the small nod in the book as a nice touch.  The sad thing is the small clif hanger at the end.  But other then that a very good read.  The part I love the most was Tyson and Ella.  Tyson is my favorite person in the Olympians so I was very happy to see him playing a other big role in this one too.  ^_^

B004WCTLNY|4.0|This is a terrific movie, an interesting mix of sci-fi/alternate reality and romance. Great acting and an original premise make this fun to watch. The mix of drama, suspense, and action will engross you, but at its heart, this is a moving and powerful romance.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Nice selection of well executed effects which you can see in real time. Only (minor) complaint it's that the app takes a while to load.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|It's hard to say why I liked this movie so much, but it's impossible to deny. It's been a VERY long time since I was so excited and impressed. There are smart surprises, fascinating ideas, incredible action, engaging emotions, first-rate acting, beautiful cinematography, and on and on. I suppose even the main theme of this paradox of such a powerful soldier in a girl's form is a spectacle in and of itself. I can see why it wouldn't appeal to some folks and I understood that my appreciation of it was personal and not universal. I'm certain the high-scoring reviews here will do a great job of explaining why this is a worthwhile movie to experience. I can do little more than contribute my five stars and add these thoughts to it.
B005A68HRC|1.0|Continuing the trend of their other albums, this album is the best example of over-production I've ever heard.  It sounds so completely laboratory-perfect that it is sickening, which makes the music (as always) come off like a \\"product\\" rather than an expression of creativity......immaculate production isn't always a bad thing, as with the Beatles' albums...but, that was because the Beatles were brilliant and perfectionists. Maroon 5 is doing none of this; they are trained puppy dogs,and boring ones at that. Producers and engineers are responsible for almost every lick of it except for the vocals. Adam Levine's voice has never been more grating and irritating.
B004LWZW4C|3.0|First class is a lot different than what I expected. The film has less  action and more slow parts instead. Now when I refer to slow parts I  would like to tell you it is story, but it is actually lots of your  time wasted by them trying to tell a story about shallow characters.  You sit through a 132 minute movie which should have been an hour and  twenty minutes because the rest is a waste of time and boring. Yes, I  know that movies like x-men are not supposed to have a best picture of  the year type of story, but if you are going to have a shallow story do  not waste my time prolonging it just give me action instead that is  better than nothing. The movie in better than \\"The Last Stand\\" and is  worth watching a second time I would say but no more than that. It does  have decent characters (Magneto and Xavier and Kevin Bacon) but the  other ones are pretty bland and than other characters are introduced in  the beginning like the woman from the CIA, but than her character is  completely forgotten in the rest of the film after her
B00005221M|5.0|Bought this for my husband. He loves this movie. Watches it all the time. He would totally recommend it!! one of his all time favs.
B004026LGQ|5.0|These are so cute! they are great for slip on and go. I love not having to deal with socks and forcing on tennis shoes. But I wish I would have done a size bigger, I bought a 4. My girls only wore them for 2 1/2 months. They are still in great shape too. I got the blue and they go with everything. But totally recommend them. I have twin girls so it was so fast to get shoes on and go. so worth buying!!!

B003PIUBZS|5.0|Oh my goodness. I watched this entire season in a matter of days. The ONLY thing I would say is if you are squeemish to blood and gore as well as sex on screen, you might not want to buy this, because there is plenty of it. Other than that, the story line is AMAZING, it's well-written, very authentic in my opinion and they couldn't have picked a better actor (R.I.P.). I see now why they were willing to wait for him when he became sick. This series had an amazing future ahead of it!!!   They have casted a new actor, as the show must go on, but no worries... even if you never watch another episode, you'll be satisfied with this season.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Saw the original Star Wars in the theater back in the late 1970's. That world has been part of my life ever since. Was skeptical about this blu-ray release, but Amazon had it at such a low price, I couldn't resist. Am glad I picked it up. Simply put, it's amazing. Please keep in mind that I do have an HD LED tv, and a Dolby 5.1 surround sound system. But the audio is remixed, the video unbelievably crisp, and the added/lengthened scenes rock. I can't possibly see how anyone that claims to be a fan of Star Wars would be critical of this. You can be cynical and try to be a \\"purist,\\" but why? If Lucas had had all this technology back in 1977, this is what it would have looked like! Do yourself a favor and pick it up. I haven't even looked at the documentaries included yet...just strictly talking about the films. Treat yourself...you will not be disappointed.
0451232577|2.0|Ken Follett's one-thousand page \\"Fall of Giants\\" suffers from the author's attempt to appeal to a vast reading audience. If you want a verboten love story, it's here; How about a political history leading up to World War I or a military history of World War I? This book offers some of each; even a history of the women's liberation movement in England.  That's the problem with this book; it covers too many themes and is cursory at best. As soon as I became involved with a character, the scene changed and I was whisked to another character, often to another country. I finally started skimming over the battle scenes because I was getting bored with the book.  This is Book 1 of a trilogy. I hope Book 2 is better focused.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|great app.  i love it.  works great on the g2x.  the comic book effect is the best.  5 stars from me!!!!!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|This is without question the most extraordinary cinematic epic I have ever seen and it's the most ambitious project since [[ASIN:B001FRNB9O I, Claudius]].  Unlike Derek Jacobi's masterpiece, which has the feel of a play, The TUDORS is a big budget production with lavish sets, a stunningly ostentatious wardrobe and  a panoramic flavor.  It details the life & times of Henry VIII along with such historical personages as Anne Boleyn, Sir Thomas More, Thomas Wyatt and a juvenile (future queen) Elizabeth.  The scope of the story is impressive.<br /><br />The TUDORS has everything the late middle ages was both famous & infamous for.  Among these are the last days of chivalry / jousts and the transition from fighting wars with knights to engaging the enemy with firearms and artillery.  It also gives us a taste of what it must have been like to live in the days where one had to always be concerned with the plague, gruesome executions,  flowery (and often bombastic) language, a corrupted monarch, arbitrary annexation of land, liberty and property and incessant shifting political and religious alliances.<br /><br />The ensemble cast is remarkable and includes such veteran actors as Max von Sydow, Peter O'Toole, Gabrielle Anwar and Sam Neill.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers has a commanding screen presence and gives us a tiny bit of sympathy for a cruel megalomaniac  who was ultimately an unlikable character and little more than an overgrown spoiled child who becomes a neurotic lunatic.  It is said that the young Henry was quite a dashing fellow and Rhys-Meyers  is a perfect choice for his portrayal of a youthful king as he's got some Errol Flynn in him.<br /><br />However, the thespian who steals the show is Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn.  Her's is not a glamorous swimsuit model's beauty.  Instead, she has a beauty that is dark, mysterious, demure, mesmerizing, subtle and absolutely intoxicating.  In other words, she was a perfect choice to portray the French seductress!  This is the first project I've seen Dormer participate in;  I'm hoping that it propels her career to new heights so I can see much more of her.  Along with that, by far & away the most interesting part of the entire series is Henry's courtship & terse marriage to Anne Boleyn.  Not to say the rest of it is boring (by a longshot), but that story-within-a-story is at the heart of the series.<br /><br />For myself, this project is a not so subtle shot-across-the-bow to far Right Wing religious zealots who would like nothing more than to remove those burdensome obstacles like the separation of church & state so as to gravitate towards a theocracy.  The TUDORS is a reminder that granting religion unchallenged political power has been tried before, and the results were rather disastrous.  Even those most hardened Right Wingers will judge that torturing & burning people at the stake for frivolous ecumenical issues is unacceptable.  That is my hope at any rate.<br /><br />As a companion to the Tudors, I would recommend [[ASIN:B000FL7C9G National Geographic - The Madness of Henry the VIII]].  It clarifies some of the finer details of the epic plot of The TUDORS and also offers information that precedes the era where the story picks up.  I cannot praise the vision and skill of Michael Hirsch enough for putting together this awe-inspiring drama.  The TUDORS is grandiose, noble, pompous, brutal, insightful and even downright sexy!articipate in;  I'm hoping that it propels her career to new heights so I can see much more of her.

B005DZMP00|3.0|Major fan of the dead here with a very good collection of live performances and studio albums, so I know what I'm talking about when I say that this album is not as good as I hoped it would be. None of the songs really stood out to me, unlike the original Europe '72 album (I guess we are calling it Vol. 1 these days thanks to this album) which didn't have a bad song on it. Most of those recordings were incredible and could send you flying with that sky high feeling when you listen to Jerry's guitar. When I recommend Dead albums to people who aren't experienced and who want to be, Europe '72 Vol.1 is the first off of my list.   Second is the artwork. It sucks plain and simple. The hype about it was huge, and for what?...its done on a computer. Big deal. It looks like crap. At least the artwork on Vol.1 was drawn by hand, which is the cool one in my opinion. Was not impressed.  Third is the packaging. You think they could've at least put it in an actual jewel case since this is the Vol.2 to one of the greatest Dead albums out there. This is a paper case that you unfold with the Cd's stuffed tightly inside. It didn't have any pictures on the inside, no information, or history of the shows that you were listening to. Nothing cool. What it did have on the last section that you unfolded, (not the back of the album),was the song titles printed upside down. Also think that the Artwork of the Ice Cream Kid ridding a chopper was printed upside down on the back. This is just poor and sloppy work. It seems like they printed this out as fast as they could just to make an even faster buck without caring at all about the music, the band, or the fans.   I give the music three stars because it's OK. Not great, but not bad tunes either. Except for Donna, she just sucks period and ruins any song she takes part in. The packaging get zero stars and two thumbs down because of the screw ups and the lack of imagination. I know this was a cheap Cd to buy and all, but come on, how hard is itto print things right side up and maybe throw a picture of the band in the middle of the case rather than just leaving a lot of empty white space? If I wasn't a major fan of the Dead I would seriously return this and keep my money, or spend the ten bucks on a better Dead album.
B00003CXRP|3.0|What I liked most is that as if the story is a replay of man's days during the dawn of civilization.<br />Hanks makes fire, grabs fruits, brings out coconut water, builds a shelter, makes bare minimum dress, prepares improvised tool for fishing and builds the boat  - everything that man had to do in prehistoric time without help of any modern tool or technology. All he had on his side was to strong will to overcome all problems in hand with undying spirit.<br /><br />No woman is there in this action replay of human history, but it emphasizes enough on importance of a partner in human life through 'Wilson' - the soccer ball. This idea of the ball as companion to talk was innovative and effective one as there was no other person on the island.<br /><br />The entire episode on the island is very fresh, rare and exciting. Usage of dialogue is very economical but thanks to Hanks, its always lively. We can feel that this is no vacation, but sort of an exile at a remote place and the resulting loneliness.<br /><br />But the end is rather clumsy as the beginning is more lengthy than necessary. Fred Smith's (FedEx's real life CEO even today) inclusion adds surprise and genuineness but the story could have well ended there. It tried to deal with another matter which demands a full scale film for itself.

Ms. Donoghue's device of using the voice of 5-year-old Jack as the narrator was a brilliant stroke of her pen.

B005OYKI1I|5.0|Fast five starring paul walker, and vin diesel is the 5th sequel to fast and furious in which its masterpiece leaves you craving for the next one, that probably will not be out for at least a year. This movie in my opinion must have had a really good screen writer. because there were a lot of parts where the movie could have fallen off the grid to ruin this action packed blockbuster but it always took a turn into making \\"fast five an instant hit to a fast five star rating!\\" All the actors and actresses worked well together in a plot that made sense and flowed nicely into action scene after action scene! I even joked about with my wife that they would somehow bring michelle rodriquez back from the dead but now they are planning to in the next movie! WOW! This hollywood cinematic feature scored big time leaving fans waiting to spend their money on the 6th fast and furious movie thrill ride!.....to be continued<br /><br />Godbless<br />~shauns moview review

B005BZQS1E|3.0|I did quite enjoy this movie and it had some funny parts, also filled with zoe deschannel who is super hot and natalie portman who is the hottest acctress ever and my fav and alone should get 5 stars, but to be fair....it had a lot of pointless swearing and the beginning was a bit slow and hard to watch until natalie portman showed up then it was a pretty decent film. I honestly don't know whether to give it 1 star or 5 stars so i picked something in the middle! Ha ha it was quite entertaining though! Very crude and lewd and I am not really into potty humor, but if they would do away with all the potty humor and lewdness it would not have been a bad film if they  would have tried to make a serious movie with a comical edge! Score one up for natalie portman and James franco, danny mcbride also was not that bad!<br />Thanks Godbless
B000002H33|5.0|MASTER OF PUPPETS is one TRUE CLASSIC ALBUM, and without any doubts one of the BEST THRASH METAL albuns ever!!!!! All the songs are AMAZING...from BATTERY to the title track, from THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE to LEPER MESSIAH and ORION....WOW!!! This is GREAT STUFF, MAYBE the best moment from METALLICA, and when METALLICA was the KING of all METAL!!!! I TOTALLY RECOMMEND this METAL PEARL if you like brilliant lyrics, inspired solos and melodies and the definitive METAL!!!! WELL DONE, METALLICA!!!!!
B0054NQZ9S|4.0|The company men did not do a bad job of making a dramtic film with a potential happy ending. Showing real-time events in our lives as what is probably happening right now in the current us of a. I love the sense of getting back to our roots and making quality products and making an honest buck to provide for our families! The world is full of \\"paper\\" pushing and we get carried away with stats rather than focusing on how to work together to make a better world and future. I just love the aura this movie gives off as the moral of the story. Overall I could not give it a 5 star rating because it was quite sad for my taste that cringed my heart, but the A-list actors were all spot on. Ben affleck was quite funny during the first half of the film. I thought it was a drama/ comedy at first lol. Nice job Ben. And the rest of the cast including up and comers all did amazing as well. Maria Bello is so gorgeous, sexy and hot even for an older woman and I am only 29 but I find her scrumptious!<br />  The company men portrays accurately what we must do as business men working for companies \\"doing honest work to make an effectual positve change!\\" Thanks for the inspiring movie!

B005F6NA56|5.0|'Metals' is the type of album that music critics love: it's extremely well-written, recorded, and produced. It also represents a clear step in a new direction for Feist. Some might even say that it is rather experimental, and there sure is a broader palette of tones and moods on display here, compared with 'The Reminder' (which I adore). If you're familiar with the mighty Beck (and you should be), Metals is Feist's 'Modern Guilt'. But of course, Feist's own brilliance is stamped on every track, and not only because of her wonderful singing. The songwriting is equally strong. Of the downtempo songs, 'Cicadas and Gulls' is gorgeous! Has Feist recorded a more beautiful song? And of the 12 tracks on Metals, nearly half are exuberant, boisterous uptempo tunes (she even rocks hard as in 'Sea Lion' on a few occasions, as in 'A Commotion' and 'Undiscovered First'). Finally, I needed to listen to this cd twice before its brilliance sank in. In time, though, Feist fans will be lapping this up...enjoy. PS: The single to me is clear: 'How Come You Never Go There.'
0553801473|2.0|I loved the first three books, anxiously awaited the 'final' book, A Feast for Crows' to only be met with an apology from the author about needing to split the final book in to two parts ... and a plea from the author to please be patient.  And to be honest, A Feast for Crows was not a great book.  I waited faithfully for FIVE YEARS to finally get the end to a story that had started out so well ...<br /><br />Only to be met with yet another disappointing book that moves the story no where.  I will not repeat in detail what others have already stated, but only say this book is a thousand pages of pointlessness.  The story goes nowhere.<br /><br />And now we must wait, who only knows how long, for yet another installment that may or may not finally wrap up the story line.<br /><br />I must say I am very disappointed that Mr. Martin seems to being going down the path of greed and squeezing out as many book sales as he can before finally giving us the ending promised years and two books ago.

0553582038|3.0|and I am very thankful for that. I started Game of Thrones about two months ago and I've just finished book four. If I had been a fan from the beginning and I had to wait five years to read this, I would have been very disappointed.  In the previous books, every once in a while, there were some chapters that were a little slow and from the POV's from characters that I didn't particularly like. It seemed like GRRM knew exactly who those characters were, because they were all in this book. The majority of the storyline is focused on Brienne, Cersei and Jaime. There are also a few chapters from Arya, Sansa and Sam, but they only play a small part in the book. GRRM must have known he couldn't get away with a book without some chapters about the Starks. So he gave us a few short chapters about Arya and Sansa. And we are introduced to some new characters from Pyke and Dorne. It seems even GRRM is not sure about these new characters, because he doesn't even put their names on the chapters. Except for Cersei, none of the characters have an interesting storyline.  There are two reasons I finished this book: 1. I was hoping that the story lines would become more interesting or I would start to like the characters. This happened in one or two cases, but overall the book wasn't as good as the previous three.  2. After having invested so much time in reading the first three books, I wasn't going to give up that easily.   In the end the book was slow and at times a bit boring. I'm hoping book five will be better, but I'm taking a break before I start that massive volume.
B000J103YI|5.0|havent recive the cd yet but i cant wait. love the movie and jennifer sings so beautiful. every song she sung where my favorite especially I love You I Do. when she sung I Am Changing it nearly brought me to tears. I could all the emotion. Anika Noni Rose is my new favorite actress, even though she didnt get alot of lines she still held her own.  she also has a beautiful voice and she got the chance to show it in Princess and the Frog. Beyonce did a wonderful job in the movie as well, she always had a beautiful voice. I love Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx voice in the music as well.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|Well ... the soundrack was excellent.  Sound editing intense, and gripping.  Aronofsky has always been a master of the immediate, of conveying a sense of actually being there and, here, he lets us peer into the world of ballet - the rehearsals, the physical demands, the unbelievable sacrifices of the dancers who perform.<br /><br />But - in the last analysis - who could really care about any of the characters depicted here?  Our main character, played by Portman, is frigid, selfish, dominated by her mother, and deathly afraid of her own sexuality.  Her mother is well played by Barbara Hershey but is the quintessential weird mom, spending all day in her apartment creating paintings depicting an inner despair, and desperation, that she passed onto her similarly weird daughter.  The ballet director is a driven master of the art form, seeking to achieve his vision of ballet while satisfying his own egotistical, and sexual, desires.  In Portman's character, he finds the perfect foil - someone he would dominate (as he had the previous ingenue replaced by Portman) but whose advances are rejected because of her omnipresent (and ultimately tiresome) timidity and fear.<br /><br />That leaves Mila Kunis' character - the biggest disappointment of the whole pointless affair. She mails in a performance that is right up there with one of her better episodes of \\"That 70's Show\\" - depicting yet another worldly, jaded, druggy \\"free spirit\\" whom women, these days, are so predictably encouraged to emulate.  What a crap performance, so stereotypical, and so atypical of what I expected from this director, who was so wonderful with the female leads in \\"The Fountain.\\"<br /><br />Well, someone should have written Darren the memo on the need for a sympathetic protagonist.  No one, not a single character in this twisted soap opera / ballet, was even remotely approximate to someone I'd want to spend 10 minutes with, let alone the almost two hours of this morbid psychotic fantasy.<br /><br />And the ballet, itself, was flaccid.  Kudos to the cinematographer for using close-ups and clipped scenes when the actors, themselves, are filmed trying (but failing) to look like real ballet performers - sort of like a ballet music video.  Frankly, though, I would have preferred watching actual, top notch, ballet perfomances by talented dancers, to compensate for the unpleasantness of this weird, pointless - and overtly misogynistic - bizarre little film.s to the cinematographer for using close-ups and clipped scenes when the actors, themselves, are filmed trying (but failing) to look like real ballet performers - sort of like a ballet music video.

0385341008|5.0|This novel introduces us to residents of the small British island of Guernsey in the English Channel who learn to cope with Nazi occupation in World War Two.  We see things primarily through the letters of Juliet Ashton, a London author, who goes to Guernsey on a writing assignment and falls in love with the whole island.  Well, with one or two exceptions.<br /><br />Through Juliet's interviews for her story, we catch glimpses of the traditional British stiff upper lip as we hear how the Nazis force people out of their houses, confiscate treasured possessions, take over crops and fuel supplies as long as they last, and are generally hostile and cruel to the islanders.<br /><br />The book title refers to a subterfuge a small cluster of Guernsey residents use as justification for meeting regularly without Nazi interference when they violate curfew.  Then, in fact, they become a real literary gathering.  The potato peel pie in question is a strange concoction one of the men brings to the literary gathering.<br /><br />Letters to and from Juliet form the entire structure of the story.  Some readers have found the letter writing format off-putting, but once you get into the swing of things, it can become a fascinating vehicle for narration, as Juliet corresponds with her publisher Sidney, his sister Sophie, and a swarm of Guernsey folks. There's an island heroine, Elizabeth, whom we never see.  Because she dared neglect or defy Nazi policy, she is sent away to prison camp, but her absence is a continuing presence in the ongoing saga of Guernsey.<br /><br />Even the darkest policies of Hitler's operatives are not too oppressive to us because of Juliet's optimism and good humor which shows through on virtually every page.<br /><br />Although Juliet falls in love with virtually everyone on Guernsey, she also is caught up in close and personal romance and near-romance at several points.<br /><br />I admit to being an Anglophile, and I hope to visit Guernsey on my next trip to the U. K.  Maybe I'll meet some of Juliet's neighbors.s.
0545265355|5.0|This trilogy in hardcover is a lovely site to behold for any book lover. Under each traditional paper cover is the hard one in it's corresponding color, with a metallic imprint of the symbol for each book. They're quite beautifully designed, and are worth the investment over the paper-backed version.  As for the actual content of the book; Ms. Collins has done an impressive job of laying out a fictional narrative with social commentary on today's government and worldwide economics. She grabs your attention form page one of The Hunger Games and refuses to relinquish her hold until the final page is turned in Mockingjay. As we follow Miss Katniss Everdeen in her journey, it constantly seems that her next move is obvious and yet Collins has you hanging on to every word. The general plot is both historical and predictable, however each decision Katniss makes is her own, and often contradictory to what one would believe to be the logical choice. She takes us through the unexpected interworkings of Miss Everdeen's mind and helps you to better understand what you yourself might do in her situation. As you come to your predictions/conclusions regarding this wonderfully sad story, Collins leaves you with a jumbled mass of emotions and thoughts that I can only conclude as a treasured read, and an unforgettable experience.

0670022950|2.0|After reading the first section of this book, I couldn't bring myself to trust the rest. Although I read it, my faith in the author's 'objectivity' had been broken. You assume that a professor such as Pinker will be objective and fair in analyzing his evidence, but it's soon clear that he's simply cherry-picking and manipulating it to fit his thesis. As an evolutionary psychologist/sociolbiologist, he has a pre-existing belief that warfare is fundamental to human nature, and has always been present. He claims that men in early hunter-gatherer societies were more likely to die in a war than men alive today and bases this assertion on date from a number of societies, including the Jivaro and the Yanomamo. The problem is that none of these societies are representative. For a start, none of them are `immediate return' societies, as human beings were for 95% of our time on this planet. Three of his groups are from the Amazon, a region where indigenous groups have always been known to be much more war-like than normal (due to a combination of historical and geographical factors). Another of the groups he chooses are the Murngin of northern Australia, who had suffered massive cultural disruption by the time data was collected in 1975. There are similar issues with the other groups - other anthropologists have argued about interpretations of the data. Pinker could have picked many other hunter-gatherer societies who have shown a much lower level of violence, so I find it very dubious that he has simply focused on these examples. There is no mention of the many other anthropologists and archaeologists who believe that war was a later development in human history and extremely rare in prehistoric societies, such as Brian Ferguson, Doug Fry or Leslie Sponsel. I have just read another study by the Dutch anthropologist J.M.G. van der Dennen, who surveys over 500 tribal groups, the vast majority of whom he finds to be 'highly unwar-like', with a small proportion who have 'allegedly mild, low-level, and/or ritualized warfare.'<br /><br />In conclusion, then, I feel that the purpose of this book is to present an ideology - the old ideology of sociobiology, now re-jigged as evolutionary psychology. This field has become increasingly discredited in recent years, and Pinker's unscholarly and prejudicial 'research' will not help its cause.ly mild, low-level, and/or ritualized warfare.'

B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I use a nikon d7000 and the flash on the camera is what I used. I purchased the SB-900 and love it.    What I love  1. The versatility of the flash. The head goes up, behind, left, right, angled - everywhere.  I am loving   shooting the flash straight up in a room which gives amazing light to the picture.  2. Battery time - you can get rechargeable but it seems regular batteries give me the most time. For a 4 hour event  I used batteries that were recharged and a pair of regular batteries. This helps with the heat sensor time as well.   As for the heat sensor, I don't turn my off but it does warn me a lot.  If you are doing heavy shooting (wedding, etc) just   turn it off and shoot a few with high ISO (which nikon d7000 allows for) AND remember that when shooting indoors using the  flash that you don't have to have your ISO on 100 or very low if your camera allows for good pics with a higher ISO. So at an  event I will shoot at a higher ISO 800-1200 and shoot and it is fine. :)  I love this flash~!

B0051T47NQ|5.0|After Let the right one in now there is this superb movie.  One is just thrown into the story and rollercoasted along to the end. Unlike many movies, this one actually doesn't insult the intelligence of its audience by needlessly long explanations. Just keep up or get left behind. Trolls exist!  Asides that, there is the wonderful nature of Norway to enjoy. Luckily, the handcam bits aren't such of such a quality like Blair witch (which added a nice claustrophobic touch to that movie) and we're able to enjoy the rough natural splendor there.   Superb movie and I hope that our Northern friends will keep surprising us which such excellent quality.
0385534639|5.0|It's been a long time since I've found a book that has captivated my attention so much that I want to read it any chance I get (during my lunch break, at traffic lights, before I go to bed, etc.). This book has barely left my side since I started it.  That being said, I was apprehensive to read this book. There was a lot of hype beforehand, and I didn't want to be disappointed. I had heard that it was the \\"new\\" Harry Potter (but then again, isn't every book these days?), and so I was nervous that it would not live up to the hype.  Well, let me start off by saying that it's not the new Harry Potter. The only similarity they have is magic, but it's not even really the same kind of \\"magic\\". The Night Circus is quite a bit darker and mysterious, and probably not something I would read to kids or allow kids to read.  However, it definitely did live up to the hype. I found the writing fresh and lush, and I felt like I was a reveur visiting the circus at times. It is very easy to get lost in the circus, fall in love with it but still feel the dark intrigue that pervades it. While I found that jumping around the timeline got a bit confusing sometimes (there were many times where I had to go back and look at the dates on the chapter headings to re-orient myself in time), I found the plot enticing, but especially the characters enthralling. While I wasn't the biggest fan of what happened with The Challenge, as I feel like it kind of came out of nowhere, I think the other 370+ pages definitely make it a worthwhile read, and I definitely loved Widget's \\"ending\\". This is probably a book that I will read again in the years to come.  Overall, a creative, enchanting, and intriguing endeavor, and I look forward to what else Erin Morgenstern has in store for the future.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|The longest time between album releases for Anthrax, for a variety of reasons that I am sure all you Anthrax fan's have googled.  More and more albums I listen to seem to have these slow \\"Intro's\\", and this one has one two.  It is creative enough but once the second track  Earth is on Hell  comes around you know that you are listening to Anthrax.  Joey's vocals are spot on, and I will go as far as saying that his effort will exceed his amazing performance on Spreading the Disease.  I won't rate each track, but I will say that \\"Devil you know\\", \\"Fight Em'\\" and \\"Giants\\" are stand outs for me.  This is a well polished effort and I think they will please many long time fan's with this effort.   Ultimately if like me, you are life time Anthrax fan you will buy this album, but even if you are just the \\"casual\\" listener I cannot recommend this album enough !!!  I look forward to seeing them tour and listening to their new stuff.

Especially love Sinner's Prayer, Chocolate Jesus, Your Heart is as Black as Night, For My Friends and Ain't No Way.  WOW!!!
B004J4WKTW|1.0|This book is such a disappointment.  The trailer on Amazon is so magical, the music both enticing and heartbreaking, but the book is nothing like that.  I'm at at 80% and don't want to continue; have had to force myself to continue.  I don't care about the characters and the competition is non-existent.  It seems that nothing is happening. There is no tension, the promised conflict is a non-event, and I just don't care.    Compare it to The Help: small chapters about different sets of people: but in The Help, I cared deeply.  I fell in love with all the characters.  The conflict hovers menacingly over everything and rolls forward pulling the reader to the finish.  Compare it to Water For Elephants.  That is vibrant and gripping, with a palpable conflict from the very beginning, with characters we can understand and love and with whom we are happy to journey. This nothing like that.  Compare it to Life of Pi: there is conflict there after the boat sinks, leaving a boy on a life raft with a tiger, but in Pi, even prior to that, his descriptions of his philosophy and his home are so charming and authentic that one is delighted to keep reading, knowing the Big Event is coming.  After the Event, the conflict is palpable: the weather is a major character, starvation is the nearest neighbor, and the tiger is breathing down Pi's neck.  And the ending makes the reader question everything that came before.  In The Night Circus, there is none of the angst, none of the gripping concern.  There is a lot that is unexplained: magic umbrellas and a few circus rides that seem alive, but once that is described, where is the tension?  Where is the conflict? Who cares?  I will force myself to finish....or I may just ask my sister to fill me in. She forced herself to finish it.  Bleh.
B00338QENI|5.0|The blend of the scientific background interspersed with the human element makes this book a difficult one to put down. While the history behind the HeLa cell line makes for interesting reading to those who enjoy biology (as I do), Rebecca Skloots takes us so much deeper into the story by describing the family behind the cells and the struggles they've encountered by growing up without Henrietta Lacks. The author also challenges us with the thought provoking ethical dilemma of whether people can really claim rights to cells that are no longer part of their body - and whether we can truly control where our cells go.<br />After finishing this book I found it difficult to immediately start another one, since it kept me thinking about it long after I read the last page.

0345528581|5.0|I am a 19-year-old girl who got mono about two years back. I was so sick when I had mono that every single one of my muscles atrophied (and I was relatively in shape before, not particularly strong but not weak or out of shape at all), and eventually all I gained back was basic strength (enough to walk up stairs although with difficulty, for example).   If you want to know how weak I was before starting my workout program about 3 weeks ago (I started Mark's program 5 days ago):  -can't do one pullup  -can't do one pushup  -unable to do one dip   without assistance  -very little grip strength  -cannot run 1/6 of a mile without feeling like my heart is ripping out of my chest  -running made my muscles sore (pretty sure that's a really strong sign of being weak)  -hardly able to do raised pushups   -can't walk up stairs without being winded (I am very thin and I breathe like I'm 400 lbs overweight) and my thighs burning  -extremely little energy to do any physical activity  I never worked out because I didn't think I had the time and I just didn't have the motivation. Then one day, it hit me that being weak would cause me to die if a disaster ever happened, because I wouldn't have the physical fitness to evade anything whatsoever. And also I might have a heart attack if I keep up this horrible inability to even breathe. Then I got serious. I went to the gym with my boyfriend and did some running and cardio because my lung capacity is so pitiful it made me mad. Small progress there but not much. I was consistently stuck on the the same weight for the assisted pullup machine, my favorite machine because I can't do a single pullup and the motion is fun to me. But I simply could not progress and I didn't know why. I was doing a hard weight for me, and doing a lot of it, so what was wrong?  Anyway, Mark taught me how to make everything more complicated so your body will get stronger. Within only the first day of Mark's basic workout, after my muscles healed from being sore(2 days), I could now EASILY do 20 pushups on a raised surface (when I could previously only do about 10 with extreme difficulty). I have not been able to test out the assisted pullup thingy yet, but I'm pretty sure I'll have improved there as well. I am so excited to have found this book because now I can work out at my house and not just the gym.  Now I work out and just tear the hell out of omy muscles with extremely extended negative motion, tons of pauses, and I will perform an action past failure and hold for as long as possible (not without good form of course!). AMAZING results. When performing the ladder-style reps, on the last 2 sets I really, REALLY force myself to do all this. I have effectively learned to beat the living hell out of my muscles and force them to man up, and so far, upon my third workout on the basic workout, it's working pretty well and I've never thought I really would be able to significantly increase my strength until now. Thanks so much, Mark Lauren, for writing this book!!   By the way, I'm not overweight nor do I have any fat loss goals so I can't speak on that front. I'm not totally sure if these workouts would actually cause you to lose fat but it sure will increase your strength which theoretically will cause you to burn more calories upon resting. It's worth a shot no matter what, because I think losing weight is pointless if you're weak. Function over form is extremely important to me although it's nice to have both. But if I was overweight I would do this anyway in addition to a lot of interval training (which I do as well just for endurance, heart health, and muscle building).   I am female but I don't think that's an excuse to be weak. I certainly do not work out like a woman anymore and I am proud of it--my goal is to one day be as strong and agile as Lara Croft (my dream since I was like 10). :)

Can't wait to hear the back catalog now that I know about them.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I really wanted to like this, but I just can't get over the color issues in the Original Trilogy. I don't understand why they would spend all the money and effort to release these in HD yet still get the color so wrong. The Death Star interior isn't grey anymore, Hoth is now blue rather than white, and Vader's lightsaber is still PINK throughout the trilogy as in the DVDs. On top of this you still have plenty of matt lines, ghosting, jump cuts, and a ton of garbage matts interspersed with cheesy 1990's special effects, most of which have not stood the test of time nor an upscale to 1080. Either leave the movie alone or do it right, pick one! The whole thing is just a convoluted mess.  I simply do not understand why they would spend all this money on these various changes only to leave so many SFX issues, old and newly created. They fixed a few shots of Vader's lightsaber from the DVDs, changing it back to red in a couple close ups, but 90% of the time, it is still pink. Unless Darth Vader having a pink lightsaber was part of Lucas's \\"Original Vision\\" this is just an incredibly shoddy restoration.  The Prequel Trilogy looks great, but I don't think anyone watches those, so it doesn't save this set.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|Maybe I'm just old fashioned but I prefer a movie to start at the beginning of a story, especially a classic like Jane Eyre, and go straight through it rather than beginning in the middle and jumping around. This DVD version of Jane Eyre jumped around at the very beginning and I suspect a viewer unfamiliar with the Jane Eyre storyline wouldn't be able to make heads or tails about what was going on for large segments of the movie. I was able to follow the story as presented in the movie only because I am very familiar with the story line as originally published. The nonsequential approach used in this version of a Jane Eyre movie may be some sort of artistic flourish in vogue with moviemakers these days, but as I mentioned, I'm old fashioned when it comes to making a movie of a literary classic, especially a classic of the standing of Jane Eyre.    At least the acting was uniformly well done. All the principal roles were well cast. I have long suspected that the role of Mr. Rochester is regarded as a plum by male leads because there is so much leeway for acting out the idiosyncracies of that character. Some of the most entertaining and enjoyable performances I've seen have been by great actors enacting the eccentricities of the Rochester role. That role in this particular version of Jane Eyre was well done but significantly more restrained than in earlier versions. The Jane Eyre role was very well performed.

B005IEF27O|5.0|So, I've listened to the album a couple times now and I think I can make an okay critique. This is Primus' first new album since 1999's Antipop, and you can tell the band has been off doing other things for a while. Like critics say, it does have more of a 'Frizzle Fry' vibe to it because they old-time drummer Jay Lane back on the set, and believe me, he has had a profound influence on this group!   Primus was never classified as 'funk metal' - in the words of their bassplayer and face of the band, Primus is more like Psychadlic Polka, and I'd have to agree. Kind of a campy, kind of Proggish, with elements of punk, funk, and yes even polka and carnival music at times. The main difference I have noticed between this album and previous works is Larry LaLonde (guitarist) 's lack of distortion. On previous records his guitar playing was highly distorted and he excelled at atonal feats of wonder (Primus is about the only atonal music I can stand listening to). On this record, he toned it down a bit and plays more clean funk-guitar. This, combined with Lane's funkier drumming, leads to some very funky moments that Primus hasn't had since the late 80's.   Many critics and fans haven't liked this change very much, but personally, this is a step in the right direction. LaLonde's atonal wanderings were always a bit hit and miss with me, but this return to their funky roots has got me interested again. There is something in every song that I can appreciate, whether it be new, funkier rhythms, or Claypool's newly acquired and aged sense of wit (Cherone fans should be able to appreciate Claypool's wit, even if it is disguised under dirty octupus funk). All in all, I would say that Green Naugahyde is a solid release, with an album's usual highlights, boring bits, and fun musical ideas.   Highlights:   -Lee Van Cleef   -Tragedy's A Comin'   -HOINFODAMAN (ho'ing for the man)
0312430000|4.0|I've been a fan of checklists since I read about them in another book, \\"The E-Myth Revisisted\\" by Michael Gerber. It gives a case study in which a hotel uses checklists to ensure repeatable quality in their housekeeping department. I use checklists in my practice as an IT consultant, with great results. So when I saw this book, it was an easy purchase.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed. Atul Gawande, a surgeon in Boston, uses vivid (and scary!) stories about problems in surgery to explain his motivation for developing a checklist technique for hospitals. He draws on the experiences of the construction industry and aircraft maker Boeing to develop, test, and refine a simple Surgical Safety Checklist. The result was a 19-step checklist that requires only 2 minutes to execute, but reduced serious complications by 36% and fatalities by 47% when tested in 8 hospitals around the world from Seattle to Tanzania.<br /><br />But the book isn't all stories, as riveting as they are. Gawande presents a theory of why checklists help. The increasing complexity of our work has led to the end of the \\"master builder,\\" the Renaissance Man who can do it all. Today, it takes teams of specialists to deliver complex products and services like an office building or surgery, with all the need for communication required by teams. Too, each individual specialist is struggling to remember everything. Checklists let the experts do their work, but provide a backstop to make sure the really critical things don't get missed.<br /><br />In all, it's a nice balance of theory and great stories. Highly recommended.

B0047Y17P2|4.0|The economy has forced Lincoln Lawyer Mickey Haller to shift from criminal law to fighting foreclosures. Once again, he stands up for the little guy--but this time it is 'agitator' Lisa Trammel. A woman whose husband left her with a balloon mortgage and small child to care for. As the bank threatens loss of her home, she hires Mickey to fend them off.<br /><br />When an executive at the bank Lisa protests is killed, she becomes the primary suspect. Mickey once again puts his criminal hat back and goes to work with the help of a new associate nicknamed Bullocks and Cisco, his motorcycle-riding investigator. The ADA is Andrea Freeman, an ambitious, tough up-and-comer who will stop at nothing to see that Lisa is found guilty of first-degree murder. Potential conflicts-of-interest arise when Andrea discusses the case with her friend from the D.A.'s office, Maggie McPhierson (the ex-Mrs. Haller).<br /><br />Michael Connely has created a likable cast of characters with the Haller novels (Lincoln Lawyer, The Reversal, 5th Witness). This is his 23rd novel and they are as brisk and readable as anything John Grisham has come up with in the last few years. Connely no doubt picks up legions of new fans with each book. For lovers of courtroom drama and snappy dialogue, [[ASIN:1455510319 The Fifth Witness]] will not disappoint.
B004NSVF7C|1.0|Although the marketing department did an excellent job of making this seem like a wonderful story, begging to be told, for bibliophiles, collectors and true crime lovers alike, alas, it is anything but. Where to begin?<br /><br />The most glaring flaw in the book is Allison Hoover Bartlett's immense ego, causing her to intrusively go on and on in inane personal vignettes that do absolutely nothing to add to the story of Gilkey (the book theif) and Sanders (\\"self-appointed\\" bibliodick, even though he is, in fact, appointed security chair by the ABAA--so where the \\"self-appointed\\" comes in, I\\"m not sure.). Adding to this, she's not a reader. At all, despite her claims to be \\"obsesssed\\" with reading about  book collecting as a result of researching the book. Her \\"obsession,\\" however, is clearly as superficial as she is. Nor is she a rare book collector (many of whom don't read, true, but do appreciate the comfort of being surrounded by books at least).<br /><br />Consequently, she bores the reader with her attempts to \\"understand\\" collectors by purchasing $40.00 copies of first editions, her personal books and what they mean to her (who cares? It's not about you, Allison), and makes herself seem like possibly the stupidest woman on Earth by constantly mentioning her struggle to \\"understand\\" Gilkey's motivation (not that she goes to a criminologist, psychologist, or anyone, really, who could help her with this). Topping it all off, she claims to be fascinated by Gilkey but at the same time worries about her friends seeing them together (though she has no problem exploiting him for this book).<br /><br />Which brings us to Gilkey: not a mastermind at all, just a petty criminal who ran an unoriginal credit card racket when that was still possible with a warmped, skewed sense of entitlement. Bartlett keeps claiming he's interesting, but does very little to show why.<br /><br />Sanders is probably the most interesting person in the book, although even he comes across as an aged hippie who likes to run a rare book shop and (justifiably) takes pride in efforts to stop theft in the industry.<br /><br />Bartlett's morals are reprehensible, and when Sanders is justifiably angry at her for taking Gilkey to a bookstore he's robbed from before, the idiot woman is actually surprised at his anger! The fact that Gilkey is depriving small business owners of tens of thousands of dollars of inventory--that often can't be insured--doesn't seem to cross the author's mind but once. She's clearly a spoiled, naive woman who has no journalistic integrity. She claims she \\"thought\\" she could be objective but couldn't help getting drawn in to the story--but she could have, time and time again, and deliberately chose not to. When she finds out that a crime Gilkey confesses to her has run out its statute of limitations, all she has to say is, \\"I was in the clear.\\"<br /><br />All that being said, it's not completely terribly written; the parts where Bartlett manages to get over herself for a few paragraphs are cohesive--if dry--enough. All tha same, I'm not sure this is the master crime Bartlett thought it was. It probably should've stayed a magazine article.aged hippie who likes to run a rare book shop and (justifiably) takes pride in efforts to stop theft in the industry.<br /><br />Bartlett's morals are reprehensible, and when Sanders is justifiably angry at her for taking Gilkey to a bookstore he's robbed from before, the idiot woman is actually surprised at his anger!

B0033AGPF8|2.0|Despite the great deal of hype that has marked the recent reappearance of Hendrix on vinyl, I am of the firm opinion that there is absolutely no comparison to be had between the 60's era Reprise tri-color pressing of Axis and the most recent 2008 and 2010 EH reissues.  Frankly, I find their overall sound to fare quite poorly when set against even the later tan-label Reprise pressings.<br /><br />Apart from the general advantage of greater contiguity with the master tapes, both the tri-color and the ubiquitous tan-label Axis seem to be completely free of the oppressive bass heaviness exhibited throughout by the 2008 B2B--a conspicuous alteration of the original sound which has been noted with disappointment by a number of experienced listeners. The more recent 2010 vinyl re-release by Experience Hendrix LLC appears to represent an earnest attempt by sound engineers to address precisely this, but does not go far enough and ends up merely confounding the problem by leaving in most of the undesirable bottom-end heaviness while artificially brightening the highs. The result is a sound which is strident, thumping, and dreary: in sum, a travesty of what Hendrix achieved in the studio and heard while playing his own records.<br /><br />Between the two, the B2B LP still sounds fine, having been sourced directly from analogue tapes and not the nearly reprehensible 97' digital remaster, though if you are seeking to experience the original AXIS sound with its wide sound stage and generous--though not shrill--top end sizzle, this is not it.

B004A8ZWW4|4.0|Just saw Real Steel this weekend and I was surprised that I liked it. After being a huge fan of Transformers since I was kid and seeing over the past 4 yrs how Michael Bay mucked those movies up, especially the last one, I was skeptical, but pleasantly surprised. I'll watch this again and probably like it more on Dvd when comes out. Not to say I didnt like it, but also just saw \\"Warrior\\" recently, both fighting movies and both movies dealing w/family struggles, but \\"Warrior\\" comes out the winner on soooo  many differnt fronts. But Real Steels fighting was great and the soundtrack absolutely ROCKED, espcially if you like Electronic/hip hop/rock all rolled into one...check it out. That said, it had great moments and then went down a little and slowed down a little, picked back up, went down a little, picked back up and went down a little. Then had a fantastic fight in the final battle. Again, the action w/ the robots blew away anything Michael Bay tried to do w/ Transformers. You could actually see who was fighting who, logically figure out what what happening and still enjoy the action. Well done.  Real Steel could've been better, but also could've been much much worse and was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked what I liked about it.

B004EPYZU8|5.0|I understand where the 1 star reviews are coming from... the story for this movie is simplistic despite the 3 tier story line (asylum, brothel and dream world).  The reason I give the movie 5 stars is because I love how crazy balls to the wall it is.  I loved the trailers and I loved the movie.  It's a visual feast for the eyes.  Just sit back and watch the effects!  As a woman, I do get inspired by all the fight scenes.    Baby Doll (our heroine) is trapped in a mental asylum.  She does things to try and escape, but what we see is a second layer that takes place in a brothel.  Then there is a third layer of a dream world that Baby Doll goes into when she dances.  Again, I love how weird this movie gets.    The dream world has a lot of interesting sequences-- fighting stone samurai, fighting german steam powered corpses... etc... it's all very random and great.    The film is an exploitation type of movie-- girls with guns in sexy outfits.  There is an underlying theme of sexual exploitation in this film, but everything is PG rated.    The ending was disappointing (no spoilers)... just not what I would have liked.    I don't buy many movies, but I bought this one to watch multiple times.  Sucker Punch is a guilty pleasure for me and I'm so glad that a strange, beautiful movie like this was made.

055357342X|5.0|I just finished reading this book yesterday and I honestly think that it is the best fantasy book I have ever read.  The only book that might compare is A Game of Thrones.  Everyone says that A Feast For Crows and A Dance With Dragons are huge disappointments, but at this stage (3 of the 5 books completed), it is so hard to believe that.  Well, I suppose I am about to find out.  At any rate, A Storm of Swords is really long, but I am happy about that, because I just never wanted the book to end.  Some things I loved about this book:  Nothing is predictable.    Deaths that you expected to be satisfying aren't.    It is so difficult to apply the simple labels of good and evil to the characters.    The characters really feel so different from one another - they are so distinct, and Martin writes them so well.  The world Martin has created is just so flawed and confused.  I just love it.  Love it love it love it!

B000E1OI7G|5.0|Traffic(released Dec/2000) sports a high powered cast with a very compelling storyline that has more than a few messages to impart to us about the so called \\"war\\" on drugs,in this case,between the U.S. and Mexico.Based on the /89 British mini-series,with another mini-series made in the U.S. in 2004,director Steven Soderbergh first pitched and wooed Fox films for backing.But due to their differences Fox dropped the project and USA films picked it up.There were still minor difference to iron out but in the end Soderbergh got full control over the project and what a job he did.Who could go wrong with a powerhouse cast of the likes of Michael Douglas,Benecio Del Toro,Luis Guzman,Don Cheadle,Catherine Zeta Jones,Dennis Quaid,Salma Hayek,Amy Irving,Albert Finney,James Brolin,Benjamin Bratt and many more.<br />The plot has three simultaneous stories unfolding, each touching the other ever deeper as the film winds its way to the end.First there are the two Mexican state policemen,Javier Rodriguez(Del Toro) and his partner Manolo Sanchez(Vargas) and the drug war between two drug cartels in and around Tijuana,Mexico;between the Juarez Cartel and the Obregon Brothers Cartel.Enters General Salazar(Tomas Milian)supposedly working for the army and the government but in reality being used by the Juarez cartel to snuff out the Obregons.The General puts the squeeze on Javier and Manolo and they are soon working for him.But eventually they both start filtering info to the U.S. government,with Manolo getting taken out for his efforts by the General.Eventually Salazar himself,with Javiers info,is taken down as his corruption is revealed to the media on both sides of the border.<br />The second story involves an Ohio judge(Douglas) who is appointed to a presidential taskforce on drug control.As he familiarizes himself with the formidable task before him,the drug war he is fighting is closer to his home than he thinks.Their daughter Caroline(Erika Christensen)needs for nothing,lives in a beautiful home and goes to a private school.However along with several classmates,she is deeply involved with drugs.Her life spins faster and faster out of control with her parents apparently unable,too busy or just in plain denial,to do anything about it.In the end her father tracks her down to a sleazy motel room and finds her naked in a bed,higher than a kite.He takes her home and both she AND her parents attend recovery meetings with her faithfully.The judge gives up his position as the head of the task force to deal with his daughters problems.<br />The third story involves two DEA agents by the names of Montel Gordon(Cheadle) and Ray Castro(Guizman).The two become involved in the take down of a local businessman Eduardo Ruiz(Miguel Ferrer),who runs a local storage facility but is a front for drug smuggling.The bust goes down but just as the DEA swoops in,local law enforcement,unaware of each others involvement,gets the jump on them.The confusion caused,almost allows Ruiz to escape.Ruiz eventually decides to turn his drug boss over in exchange for immunity.His boss is also a local businessman,Carlos Ayala(Steven Bauer)and when he gets taken down his wife(Jones)is left to fend for herself.On a jail visit he tells her about a painting in their study.She investigates and finds the names of local contacts including a hitman and several out of country accounts he has.When she is threatened by a rep from the Mexican drug cartel for a money debt,the Obregan cartel in fact,she decides to pay a visit to them personally.She smuggles in pre-molded cocaine which is totally undetectable by sniffer dogs or any agents;this one being in the shape of a toy.In exchange for this new way of smuggling drugs she asks for total control of the drug distribution in the U.S.from the cartel,forgiveness of the money her husband owes and to take out Ruiz,the DEA witness.The deal is made and in short order Ruiz is dispatched through simple food poisoning.Because of this the DEA's case is dropped and Ayala is set free.However the DEA still plugs away as agent Gordon crashes Ayala's homecoming party,planting a bug under his study desk.<br />The subject of drug trafficking is a sordid and complicated mess.The movie amply points out that the drug lords have more of EVERYTHING when it comes to resources than any government agency.The well known corruption of the Mexican government both state and local is also fleshed out.The so called\\"war\\" is anything but;more like a rout in reality.Money buys alot and the government not only has to contend with the Mexican drug trade but also their tentacles,which stretch into the very fabric of North American society from those that sell it(from the big shots to the little guys on the street)to the buyers themselves.Soderbergh does a masterful job unfolding all three stories and in a non-complicated manner.This film won four Academy awards and it is not surprising to see why.<br />Technically speaking this print was made from a new digital transfer,with the Spanish subtitles presented as they were in the original U.S.prints,as per the directors request.It is in its original a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.The soundtrack was mastered from the original 24 bit master and includes Dolby 2.1 and 5.1.There are two discs.The first contains,the

B004K4IZ54|5.0|First off, I think that the review by \\"Strategos\\" was right on and covered just about all of the main points. The religious overtones and questions about religion in general are HUGE in this movie - IMO, it's good to see that Disney are trying to open the minds of younger movie-goers that watched this movie.  By and large this got panned by the critics, but I think they really missed the point. I went into this thinking it was going to be \\"so-so\\", but came out of it really impressed.  If you are not sure about this movie, definitely check it out. On a nice widescreen LCD, with a good surround system, this is a GREAT movie to watch at home.  Recommended !

B004Y1USV2|5.0|This is a great album, the one I've been waiting for from Yes. Being a fan of the 1970s Yes sound I found almost everything since then a disappointment. Despite Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman not featuring in the line up, the sound is not only unmistakably Yes but I'd rate it equal to their early work. Catchy themes, nice song hooks, singable, great Yes harmonies, imagination capturing lyrics and consistency throughout the album. I wouldn't want to do without any track. The musicianship as always is exceptional. Steve Howe's 12 string guitar work on Hour of Need is perfect. The album finishes with one of the strongest tracks - Into The Storm, good candidate for air guitar/performance practice. It's been playing consistently in car since I first heard it (good place to practice your backing vocals). For the Yes fan - Highly Recommended.
B0057OOQN6|5.0|esoteric outdone themselves with this reissue.  the original material sounds great.  the electronics, percussion, voices and guitar work all sound crisp.  it just makes this already good release sound that much better.  and as a bonus, we get a live disc recorded at deutswchlandhalle berlin, 11/29/73.  again, this is some of the best sounding live material i've heard from the dream in years.  the line up for both the studio and live material is the classic pink era personnel of froese/franke/baumann.  this line up has always been my favorite.  it's time to replace your old cds with this new 2 cd reissue.  informative booklet too.  highly recommended for a musical journey to the nether regions of the mind, and a great job esoteric!
B004HW7JMY|5.0|The Blue Ray was so clear that during the fighting I had to check to see if any of the blood has splashed on me!  The sound is clear and crisp.  Felt like I was in the arena Great show, great DVD.
B005BQTUVI|4.0|I liked this blu-ray directors cut for the super clear widescreen anamorphic picture, but they cut other key scenes out to put in a silly preganancy sub plot, overall the original version was much scarier and better done, they should have included the original version on the disc,they didnt so i bought the canadian blu-ray now i have both versions on blu-ray the original is the better version!
B0052VUNHC|1.0|This book was so nasty at times that I just had to skip a couple pages. I don't like Travis' character, or Abby, because she comes of as a serious slut. I hate how Travis begs her to forgive him like a little blasted baby, then he goes and beats up anyone that even glances at her! Abby's brain must be clouded with something because how could she not see that Travis had some SERIOUS anger issues? He was over protective and violent. The whole story line of this book is fight. Makeup. Fight. Makeup. Fight. Makeup. Who wants to read that?! In this book, sex seems to fix all their problems which I found highly disturbing. Why would Abby sleep with him on her last night at his place? It's not like you'll never see him again! And at that valentines dance they were fighting and Travis forcefully made her go home back to his place where they had sex and BOOM. Problem solved, they're back together and all happy happy. I don't know what the purpose of Parker was. Why would Abby see another guy when she's living with Travis? America and her boyfriend had no point n the story either. America could clearly see Travis was jacked up in the head and didn't even try to talk Abby out of the dysfunctional relationship. What kind of best friend is that?! And mare. Really? Mare for a nick name? This book was a waste of money and time and filled with violence and sex. That's all this book is. I also don't understand how abby told Travis that she wasn't ready to marry, and then not even ten chapters later she asks him to marry her! It was also very creepy to see that Travis had already gotten a ring. What is WRONG with him?? There is also nothing, NOTHING that special about Abby that would make a violent guy like Travis so obsessed with her. She seems to be like just any other girl he's slept with. Don't get this book unless you like violence, dysfunctional relationships, very graphic sexual content, characters that lack the ability to think clearly and be mature, and punctuation errors. And another thing, pigeon is the dumbest nickname you could ever give someone. I mean, come on now. The author could have done sooooo much better.

B004AUGJS8|4.0|I rented this movie after seeing only part of it on cable. I tried to view the rest of it, but it wasn't available On Demand so I immediately came here because I absolutely had to see the ending.   I was shocked that I liked it because I usually don't watch docu-dramas. I had never heard about the real life case so all of the details were new to me. Surprisingly, Ryan Gosling was fantastic as the lead. His personality unfolds so smoothly and the tension surrounding his relationship with his wife (Kirsten Dunst) keeps you on your seat.  It's definitely worth the money.
B004LWZW42|5.0|purchased this movie for the wife since she collects all of this series. she loved it.  what else can I say?
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Can see some idea copied from fullmetal alchemist animation.  Anna Torv is a very good actress.  Overall it is a worthy to watch show.
B004ZNA5JO|5.0|This Pink Floyd 2011 remaster is just a bit fuller in bass warmth than the original from 1987 and like all of the 2011 Pink Floyd remasters there is an ever so slight treble rolloff which in the case of A Momentary Lapse of Reason makes it sound less digital, more refreshing. Drink up.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Scotty is  country music's newest star. My favorite track is \\"The Trouble With Girls\\". This is a song about girls can be a pleasant distraction. I can relate to the lyrics of this song.  \\"You Make That Look Good\\" is about a woman can make a truck look better than it is.  This is a very fun song to listen to.  The piano playing sounds cool. \\"Back On The Ground\\" is a slower tempo song.  This is a  song about Scotty coming home to visit his mother.  Scotty's vocals are touching on this track. \\"Out Of Summertime\\" is a  fun love song.  I love the banjo playing on this track. \\"I Love You This Big\\" is a perfect song about gratitude. This is his first single.  I love it. \\"Dirty Dishes\\" is a song with lovely guitar playing.  This song is about the blessings of family life.  \\"Clear As Day\\" is a song about certain events in life remain as clear as day.  It starts off as a sweet love song, but it is sad toward the end. \\"Water Town Tower\\" is a tribute to Scotty's home town of Garner, North Carolina.  This is an upbeat tune and fun to listen to. This is a strong debut album by Scotty McCreery.  Walk In The Country is a groovy country tune.  The electric guitar playing gives this a song a punch.  This song gets me moving. This album is very entertaining.
B004ZN9W5M|4.0|It sounds much better than the very FIRST release from the late 1980's (which I kinda like) but it's almost exactly the same as the last Wall remaster. That's from two exact model CD players synced up at the same place all the way through. With just speakers no difference but with high end headphones and A/B comparing with my remote on my receiver, I could hear an ever so slight difference - just a tiny half notch of treble rounded off on the new remaster. No difference in speed whatsoever. It's 99.9% the same Wall.<br /><br />\\"This Roman Meal Bakery thought you'd like to know\\"<br /><br />(Just heard that for the first time after owning The Wall in some form since 1979)
B003Q6D25K|3.0|When their home is ransacked, the Rey family (Sprague Grayden, Brian Boland, and Molly Ephraim) installs a security system with video cameras in every part of the house just in time to capture the paranormal events centering on their young son, Hunter.  I love the shaky-cam, docudrama genre, and I enjoyed the first film, but this one fumbled the ball.  It's not a complete disaster; the way its story dovetails with the plot of the first is quite clever.  Unfortunately, this one is too much foreplay without enough payoff.  It also stretches credibility too much at times in order to put certain events on screen; I don't think a teenage girl would talk into a camera the way this one does, and most families would get a flashlight when the lights go out rather than rely on the light on their video equipment.  I also rolled my eyes at the stereotype of the Hispanic maid who just happens to be a fount of knowledge on demons and exorcism.
B004ZNA7WY|4.0|There is almost NO difference with the new 2011 Division Bell remaster and the original. With two exact model CD players synced up to the exact same place all the way through and A/B comparing all the way through I could hear NO difference with just speakers. With headphones I could hear only a very tiny difference - they lowered the treble just a half a notch (if that much) - so slightly you have to really pay attention with headphones to hear any difference whatsoever. Just kinda rounded it off ever so slightly. Maybe this sounds a little smoother to Guthrie and Co. The new remaster is just a hair faster. Maybe a tenth of a second - not a big deal. Even though, hitting pause on the faster of the two to sync it back up perfectly, the new remaster would eventually overtake by about a second. That's not a lot actually. This new 2011 remaster is 99.9% exact to the original. Oh well. Money, it's a hit. They just need more I suppose. The people that remaster should have a blog telling what they did chapter and verse that made it sound any better. In their defense somewhat..when you remaster a band's back catalog, some of CDs don't NEED anything done to them much if at all. This is probably the case with this one. But then again not a lot of difference in The Wall and it's last remaster either. Just a treble half notch of difference all the way through in that too. Otherwise it's the same. 5 stars for the Division Bell of course but 4 stars because it's 99.9% the same.
B004A8ZX2I|4.0|This is not as good as \\"Taken\\", but it's close.  There is a lot of well-filmed action, and a lot of surprises.  As someone who lived in Berlin for three years, I especially enjoyed the scenes in locations I was familiar with.  I had originally seen the movie in a theatre, and because it depends on a major plot twist to make sense, I was concerned that a second viewing would have no suspense.  Fortunately, I was wrong, and it holds up with repeated viewings, as long as you accept the basic premise.  Liam Neeson's character undergoes a tremendous change in basic personality, not fully explained by his temporary amnesia, and a scientist carries the only copy of all his extensive and valuable research around in a single laptop computer without backup.  Despite these and smaller flaws in logic, as long as you don't ask why, the movie flows along and is very entertaining.
B001BN1ZHW|3.0|I've seen Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd three times on DVD (after seeing it once in a movie theater). I say Burton's Sweeney on purpose: this is not what I would consider Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney. Never before this production has Sweeney Todd seemed wispy to me. But wispy seems the principal mode of all Burton's films (working best in Ed Wood and to some extent Corpse Bride, but disastrous in his Batman films). Every production I have seen of Sweeney, including the original Broadway production many times with Angela Lansbury and once with the replacement cast, has been vibrant and bold, not enervated and wan like this film. And removing \\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\\" (even if Sondheim went along with it) takes away the spine of the work. I've seen a production of the work (and this includes the other two DVDs, the production at Circle in the Square, and a wonderful production at the University of Alabama in which stage blood was not used) that seemed so bloodless, in spite of the gallons of fake blood splashed around in this movie as if to try to create some sense of tension or excitement). Always before the characters and the setting have seemed incredibly vivid. In Burton's film, all color is washed out of setting and performance (other than the fake red).<br /> In defense of Helena Bonham Carter, my sense is that her lackluster performance is a result of Burton's conception and direction. She can pull out the necessary stops when required (see her performance in David Fincher's Fight Club, and speaking of Fincher, too bad he didn't direct the film). In The King's Speech she had much more spunk than she did as Mrs. Lovett. And whose idea was it to give Mrs. Lovett signs of second thoughts, of hesitation, of conscience? Mrs. Lovett is a great steamroller of a character who would have stuffed that particular genius in the meat grinder without a sign of remorse. Yes, Johnny Depp is better than acceptable much of the time, but his performance too suffers from being held back.<br /> One of the horrors of the film, its truest horror, is what Burton did to \\"A Little Priest.\\" On stage the principals are regarding each other, egging the other one on to a serious folie deux. In the film they are looking across the street and commenting on what they see. The song mentions a priest? Show a priest. A grocer? Show a grocer. A Royal Marine? Well, guess what! And then the song simply peters out.<br /> Oh, I could go on, but why bother.<br /> Yes, it is the best \\"movie\\" so far made from a Sondheim work. If you've seen the others, you know that this is not high praise. Is it a bore? No. It is simply a B-grade version of one of the great theatrical works of the last century. Is it a triumph? Never..

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This is enjoyable even for first-time viewers.  But it is MUCH more awesome for any Firefly fan.  The characters have been developed since the Firefly shows.  For Nathan Fillion fans (yes, I confess that I join those ranks), he is great in this movie - but he is not very likeable to a first-time viewer.  I especially enjoyed the development of the River character.  She kicks butt!
B002SSBD6W|5.0|Eating Animals is a personal story about this nation's meat eating habits. The book focuses on the horror of factory farming and explores the alternatives.  The narrative is compelling and reads almost like a novel.  It is actually quite the page turner, something that is hard to say about alot of other thought provoking books.  This is not a philosophy book but it will challenge you in ways that a typical philosophy book on the subject would not.  Highly recommended.
0316017930|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell writes one of the greatest books on success ever. He does not over-simplify information as his critics have claimed. He makes connections from events that we know, to histories, and events that nobody could have possibly thought related to each other. It is a truly great book.
0446585025|5.0|Ellen, if you ever decide to read you own reviews on amazon for your book and you choose my review to read, I have one thing to tell you...THANK YOU! This book is hilarious! And that is an understatement! Thank you for making my days lighter, brighter and much happier...because life can get real stressful sometimes especially with a one year old boy! Also, Ellen I'm a huuuuge fan and I would love to be in your audience if possible one day! Thank you!
B00466HN86|5.0|I heard about the movie on a christian radio show and decided to make it a girl's day out treat. The movie completely blew us all away! We cried , We clapped, We cheered, We laughed and most of all We praised God. The movie should be watched by entire families, not just men. I plan on buying everyone I know one for Christmas this year. I wish that every young person thinking of getting married would watch this movie before doing so.  I thank God that the people who put this together on the big screen did so. They also brought the matter of salvation up in a natural way that I feel will help people who are seeking God get saved. Thank you! Watch it. If you never see another movie this year, be sure to see this one!
0321687299|1.0|This must be a joke. There are several books out there. This one is the worst out of all. I don't know why people suggested this was a 4.5/5 book. There is barely any information.

Not only have I been trying to follow it, but it has such   very good information that everyone who is worried why they can't lose weight   or the ugly belly can profit from reading this book.
B0033B5XCS|2.0|Just got my shipment in today, and was stoked that it got here in such a short time.  However, when I got it open I found out that this \\"NEW\\" item was absent the first disc and in it's place was a double feature disc of the 7th and 8th movies.  Not to mention there were smudges all over the disc.
B001LNOOG6|5.0|Truly excellent; Archer is a superb writer, and I'm delighted he has started another serial.  I can't wait for the sequel, which I understand will be in the spring of 2012.  It is fast-paced, exciting, and unputdownable!
B000UDKZ1Q|2.0|The music is great. A nice re-styled 1930's blues-jazz music. It has a sultry relaxed feel that is absent in current music. It almost feels like the antidote for today's sound. The bad: Most of the MP3 songs I bought are distorted. None of my other Amazon downloads are like this. I doubt the CD has the same problem or people would not rate it so highly. It annoys me that I thought my player had a problem and found and had to spend hours troubleshooting. Same problem on different players.

B003UESJ9M|1.0|This movie may be called country strong but its more like country weak.  The plot is disjointed and derivative.  The acting was unconvincing.  Gweneth Paltrow was  not believable in the lead role either in her acting or her singing.
0345529057|5.0|Ok so I was a bit worried about how good the books were, but let me say that I was amazingly suprised......This means that the books blew my mind. I would greatly recommend these books. The story takes amazingly unexpected turns in a very good way. The characters are so well fleshed out that you feel as if you are living and breathing the story. Hats off to George R.R. Martin.
0385534639|1.0|I give up.  I cannot get to the end of this book.  This was my second attempt and I made it 200 pages in before releasing myself from my self-imposed obligation to finish.  Reading this book was work, replete with sighing and intermittent looking at the last page to see how much more is left.  It is so boring.  There is a little prettiness in the book, buried between a lot of walking on paths and a lot of he went here and then she went there-ness.  I don't understand how the night circus, which arrives by train in London, crosses the ocean to make it to Concord MA? Why did I have to read the name Chandresh Christophe Lefever over and over again?  What a mouthful.  Are Celia and Marco creating these tents?  Where does it say that in the book?  There are a series of publications called Somerset Studios where artists showcase their quirky and whimsical paper mache or polymer clay figures and then write a description of these figurines inhabiting imaginary worlds, such as a night circus.  The pictures and the descriptions are always magical and delightful, and fill approximately no more than two pages.  That's what this book reminds me of, only drawn out ad nauseam.   Edited to add:  On my third attempt I made it to the end.  I still don't get what happened. There was not one single question I was waiting to see resolved. There were a lot of conversations between characters and I had no idea why they were coming together and why they were talking about what they were talking about.  Still no explanation on how the train makes it across water, even to Australia.  I thought by not finishing the book I had missed out on the Celia and Marco love affair, but now that I read through those scenes it was all so lackluster and without any real emotional foundation.  I'm just baffled by all the praise.
020161622X|4.0|This book is a great balanced perspective of how to appropriately approach software design and development. While it doesn't really focus in on any particular language, it's a great approach to becoming a better programmer over all. I'd highly recommend it for those who want to become masters at the art of software design.

B003ZSJ212|2.0|I preordered this as soon as it was available and after getting it, I really wish I hadn't.    Pros: The picture and sound quality are amazing for all the movies, especially the prequels.  The new yoda in Episode I was a great improvement over the cheap looking puppet in the original.    Cons:The original trilogies were a huge disappointment.  They didn't fix any of the lightsaber coloring as rumors were saying, Luke's saber in A New Hope was still grainy just as an example.  The new Krayt Dragon yell Obi-Wan made was horrible.  It was almost like female tennis player's grunt as she hits the ball.  There weren't a lot of new things in Empire, except for maybe some different camera angles in some shots.  Return of the Jedi was ruined for me even more.  It's still the special edition that should have never been plus even more additions that should have never been.  The biggest would be the now infamous \\"NO...  NOOOOOOOOO!\\"  They changed some camera angles in the final saber fight and during the scene with Jabba's barge that kind of made it weird to watch.  I've only seen the blu-rays once and probably won't watch them again unless it's a prequel.  I still need to see the bonus footage so I'll update once I do that.  Lucas needs to put his creativity to the backburner and re-release the original trilogy as a cleaned up version without the \\"special edition\\" junk.  As my title says, buy the prequels on blu-ray and try and get the originals on laser disc (only way to get the actual originals in the best quality available) unless you want all the bonus material.
B005974CDU|5.0|As a somewhat older fan of 1970s progressive, I am always on the lookout for new and interesting music.  I have never been a fan of heavy metal, so my interest in this group tends to stem from their more \\"progressive\\" material, and there is no shortage of that on this 2011 release.  Overall, I was thrilled with the music and the musicians - they are keeping the approach to musicianship as olympic-scale spectacle alive.<br /><br />Although the complexity of the ensemble work and speed with which they play is mind-boggling, A Dramatic Turn of Events is really not just about that.  These guys are pretty good composers and utilize dynamics effectively.  In fact, although there may have been an awkward arrangement here or there, the entire album seems to flow together seamlessly as a song-cycle.  They also have a good grasp on melodies and there are a surprising number of them on the album.  I also like the quieter moments and the acoustic piano playing - it is nice to hear Jordan break things up with different tone colors rather than simply pressing the keyboard into service as another electric guitar.  James LaBrie is in fine form and his voice is still strong and clear - I am glad that his singing on the album was not ruined with the awful \\"cookie-monster\\" growling that turned up on Black Clouds and Silver Linings (2009).  My understanding is that former drummer (Mike Portnoy) was responsible for this.  Last but not least, I can actually hear John Myung - his bass provides nice counterpoint.<br /><br />With respect to the change in drummers, Mike Mangini is among the finest rock drummers in the business and his performance on the album is alternately subtle and earth-shaking (he plays parts on the drum kit that I did not think were humanly possible).  He is, above all else, an ensemble player and really listens to the other guys - I think that this is the most significant change in the overall sound.  Come to think of it, I prefer Mangini over his predecessor, who tended to overplay (that is how it sounded to me).<br /><br />The production quality is very good.  There is more of an overall balance between the different instruments and as I said before, I can actually hear John Myung.  The CD booklet features the lyrics (mostly written by John Petrucci), a group photo, and some arty images.<br /><br />All in all, this is a superb album by an exciting group.  Although I am not a fan of heavy metal, this group appeals to me because they know how to compose and place an emphasis on melody.  This makes for a nice balance between overwhelming virtuosity and pleasant ballads.  Recommended along with Scenes from a Memory (1999).t is how it sounded to me).

0984536159|2.0|I didn't think I would be reading something as enjoyable as say Mark Twain or Ernest Hemingway but I couldn't get through the first two pages of this thing before I had to put it down.  It was so choppy and misplaced and required so much attention on my part (probably more than I am willing to give this book), when I looked to see it was something like 800 pages I couldn't imagine putting in the required effort to reading this book.  You read this book if you have to (maybe a research project or something) not because you want to.  I thought I would be getting a real good snapshot into Hitler's mind, which you probably will, but you might as well watch a documentary on him and get the same information in one or two hours that it would take to read this entire book.

B004Y1USV2|4.0|I must admit, I got into Yes in my teens during the Rabin years and went backwards, getting into the so-called classics of 'Roundabout', 'Yours is no Disgrace,' 'Heart of the Sunrise,', etc. I bought the box set in 1991 and went deeper, enjoying the not-so familiar hidden classics like 'Siberian Khatru.\\" And by the way, I hate 'Awaken,' which even the band thinks is their best work.<br /><br />Which leads me to my point. Every 'Yes' fan has their favorites, but they appreciate EVERYTHING the band does.<br /><br />If anything, the concept of 'YES' is that it is ever changing, both in the lineup and the sound. But the one constant is no matter WHO is in the band, the quality of the musicians is on par with any group throughout history. What would you rather have, a band that manufactures the same sound for 20 straight albums or this one. There are albums I cannot get into - 'Topographic Oceans, Relayer, The Ladder' - for whatever reason. Every 'Yes' fan probably has theirs. I personally think 'Talk' is just as good as 'Fragile'<br /><br />If you take this independently and don't compare it to the wide range of releases from 'The Yes Album,' to the '90125' years, it is a well-done piece of music. Remember folks, '90124' shows us what Rabin's songs sounded like before they were polished.<br /><br />If you're telling me this album doesn't sound like Yes because Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman aren't involved, you're not a true 'Yes' fan. Stop with the Rabin vs. Howe, Wakeman vs. Kaye, Bruford vs. White debates. Stop trying to forget 'Drama.' Accept this band for its ability to adapt ... and more impressively ... endure despite all the hating and bashing. In the end, the album proves music wins over all. Give it a try. I did. I may listen to it for a week and forget it... or it might become another favorite. But Yes fans should give it a chance.<br /><br />If you've ever watched the Yesyears documentary, Wakeman says himself, \\"I truly believe in 50 years when I'm dead and buried, there'll still be a 'Yes'.<br /><br />And hopefully, for true Yes fans, he's right.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|I don't want to spoil anything up front(though there's not much to spoil), so I will not debate any plot points until the end, marked by the big \\"*********\\". If you want to see this movie, please don't read past that point.  Here's a few things to consider, though. In 2 1/2 hours of movie, I felt like I got about 10 minutes of Transformer fighting in. Seriously. Pretty bad for something billed \\"The Greatest Action Movie of All Time.\\" There was more action of humans running to and from battles, but that was about it.  There's probably about 30 minutes of those slow motion scenes where someone's walking to or from something exploding, or that slow-motion \\"dramatic pause\\".  10 Minutes of Action does not make an Action Movie! I would have settled for ten minutes of good plot.  On to the spoilers (DO NOT GO PAST THIS POINT IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THE MOVIE)  ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************  So let me get this right, Sentinel Prime is a traitor, but gives the life spark back to Optimus when it's offered to him. Ummm, bad guy Prime, that was game, set, and match. Would have made winning that war pretty easy. This scene is so bad when you see in the very next scene Sentinel shows he's a traitor.  And the second unbelievable point: Sentinal makes a deal with the Decepticons, but they Shoot Down His Ship while he's making a getaway to them? Really?  And the most powerful Transformer ever, Optimus Prime, can't fight his way out of a few cables? Doesn't even try?  Bumblebee and the others are fighting. Prime says \\"it ends here!\\" Literally 2 seconds later, in the next scene, they're all capture except for Prime and getting executed one by one.   Umm, Michael Bay, what's up with having two Autobots that just toss jokes back and forth? Were the ice-cream trucks lesson enough, or do you have to your own Jar-jar Binks in every movie?  As powerfulas Soundwave is, why isn't he king of the Transformers? Seriously. You might have overpowered that guy.  And the guy who's saved the world twice can't even get a job recommendation from the government? Or even talk to the Autobots? Really?  I was so frustrated with this movie I got on just to write this review. I wish it made more sense, but hopefully it conveyed a complete and total frustration with the lack of quality directing and script-writing Hollywood is putting out. A big name or two, some special effects, and they hope we'll all drool through the movie.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I grew up watching this movie and I loved it when I was little. As an adult I am happy to be able to watch this movie with my family and see it remastered and brought to blu-ray. My son loves this movie and it's something that the whole family can enjoy together. In my opinion it is one of the best animated films ever made. After having watched the original on VHS for all these years it was exciting to see the crisp and clear version of it on Bluray. The audio and video in this edition are amazing, and there is a version of the movie with a new song. And though I found the new song a little out of place, my son loved it. There are a ton of extras and lots of fun things to check out, but the movie by itself is worth the money we spent. I'm very pleased with my purchase and I will say that this is a must have for any Lion King fans out there.
B000F3UAFC|3.0|I was surprised how clean the movie was, but the delivery of lines was surprisingly flat. A shame, because this is a lavish film (visually) with plenty of good actors and pithy lines.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Thank you so much.  Very satisfied with the product!!!  Why pay full price in a store where I can get a product of perfect quality at a fraction of the cost?!?

B004EPYZTE|5.0|I have been a Conan fan since 1972, when my big brother Johnny and his wife,Sharyn, bought me my first Conan book 'cause I was intrigued by the cover.One read, and I was hooked! Little did any of us know then, that Johnny's beautiful wife would die only four years later.  Johnny himself was my lifelong best friend/fill-in dad/and hero. Where I was a geek;he was the family black sheep, given to brooding; brawling (he never lost a fight in or out of the boxing ring!)and a temper that made The Hulk look like a school-girl. I tell you this, not to share my life's story,but to explain my vested interest in;indeed, love for,the character REH created. Because, with the rage; the blue eyes; the brooding; the lustiness;etc.,when I read the books, I saw Johnny as the character. Sadly, I lost him 2 years ago.And with him,my world.So, if anybody had a personal reason to view the new \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" with a wary eye, it was me. And I was blown away!    I won't list each and every little thing they got right...we'd be here all day. But I will say that it is 90% the essence of Howard's character.There's also some of Thomas's; Truman's...hell, even a nod or two to Milius, who clearly didn't get Conan at all! (Groveling and whining at an enemies feet; looking ashamed,head down, refusing to meet a king's gaze, in a throne room?!This is NOT Conan! Where's the arrogance? The defiance in the face of his captors? The rage at his enemies?...In the Nispel version, that's where!)    There are those who say it should have gone to a Cameron; a Jackson; even Ridley Scott or Mel Gibson. Jackson, based on the first 2 \\"Rings\\" films, okay. But \\"Return of the King\\";\\"King Kong\\"? They are 'disappointing' to be kind. Cameron hasn't made a film with true excitement and rooting interest since \\"Aliens\\";Scott has way too many muted conversations and far too much \\"Saving-Private-Ryan\\"-shaky-cam action in \\"Gladiator and His \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" & \\"Robin Hood\\"? Yawn! Gibson has too many scenes of basically the same conversation between Robert the Bruce and Wallace in \\"Braveheart\\" and his action is either poorly photographed or nonexistant.(A siege that sort of begins;is never shown;and the next scene we see Wallace and company fleeing the burning ruins? Sheesh!)    Howard's Conan lived life.His actions,swift and brutal;his lustiness almost without measure; a \\"Blood red haze\\" didn't swim before his eyes because he was the village idiot(like the '80s versions.) He ate and drank all aspects of life like a starving man at a feast.And this is what the 2011 film captures: with its cast; its director;its photography;its costuming...even the music is better than I expected. Is it perfect? No.Duh. Movies are made by people and people are far from it.But Mamoa owns the part like Craig owns Bond.And the rest of the cast backs him up at every turn. If you've only seen it once( or worse,took a friend's advice and not seen it at all) give it a chance on dvd. It pays homage to almost every incarnation of the character and Mamoa is riveting to watch.And for less than 100 million dollars? In this day and age? Hell, it looks like it cost twice that much!  Finally,I can say, after almost forty years, I've seen the 'real' Conan on the screen! I just hope the spirit of my big brother was there to see it with me. Rick Garrett

0307586901|3.0|As always, the pictures are lovely and the completed crafts unique and dazzling, but sadly, I wasn't very inspired.<br /><br />First off, there are a lot of thinsg to buy, many of them pricey and only found at craft stores and second, many of the crafts don't seem very durable, so basically you'd only have them for the one holiday and once you took them down they'd go straight into the garbage, frown.<br /><br />Her are some examples of these disposable crafts:<br /><br />Gilded pears - take some pears, cover them with real gold dust.  Done.  Not only am I skeezed out by the thought of making a perfectly edible food into a non edible art, GOLD DUST is frigging pricey!  Not to mention people starving, sorry, it just made me mad, it seems wildy inappropriate right now.<br /><br />Golden Walnut Ball - Stick walnuts, real ones, onto a ball, spray paint them gold. this one would probably last a holiday or two, but it is again, food being wasted.  I grew up in a trailerpark and wasting food bothers me, I know, get over yourself, but old habits and all that.<br /><br />Gourd Candles - Melt wax into a hollowed out gourd, light it on fire.  Okay, okay, there is no directive to light it on fire, and I will admit the candles are pretty and props for the fact that people don't eat gourds (can they be eaten?) but these will be a one-dinner-party attraction and I'm kinda craft-challenged, if I go to the expense and time of making something, I'd like it to be around for more than a couple of hours.<br /><br />But some of the crafts were genius, for example;<br /><br />A paper Sail centerpiece for a Thankgiving feast, the pictures show a perfectly pristine craft stick, but I think a dry stick from the garden could work just as well, same with the tiny bucket of rocks - I like that it's easily found and cheap!<br /><br />Pilgrim Hats and Bonnets - easily made by kids, talk about a real Thanksgiving celebration, you could really get into the spirit of Thanksgiving and everyone could make their own!<br /><br />Napkin rings made of paper or felt or acorns(I have a few acorns in the yard, the ones the squirrels have missed).  There's a big section at the back of the book with clip art for various crafts.  Very helpful.<br /><br />The crafts range in skill level from easy, pumkin pouch party favors (if you can use tape and scissors you're ready for this one) to the expert, pumpkin carving that DaVinci would approve of.<br /><br />All in all, this is a pretty comprehensive book, I only found a few crafts to try out myself, felt fortune cookies, flower pop up cards and the excellent directions for papier mache.  But mostly this is a book for the serious crafters who live next door to a Michaels Craft store.s in the yard, the ones the squirrels have missed).

B003UESJH4|5.0|A great movie about a a royal individual's lack of self-confidence and a friend who helped him overcome his speech impediment. Having had one myself, I know what a challenge this can be. It's even better because it is a true story, at a pivotal moment in history, when a nation needed a fearless leader. A must see and a must own if you loved it after viewing the movie.

B0053Q9DHW|5.0|In the theatre I steeled my heart against this production because I am very loyal to the Toby Stevens version. But after watching it on DVD I was converted.   Like every version of \\"Jane Eyre\\" this movie leaves a great deal out. Two hours just isn't enough time to do more than capture the flavor of the book. For example this movie races from their first conversation to the fire scene which does not allow for enough development in their relationship.   Having said that, this movie captures the passion of the book. This may be my second-favorite adaptation but that doesn't mean it's not wonderful in and of itself.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Had played the demo version but the full version bring the gameplay to a new level! I really like the latest boxes! Please bring the rest of the iphone versions on android also! :-)
B004LROMSO|3.0|I received this DVD set as part of the Vine program and had not heard about it prior to my selecting it. On broad terms, I would rate this series as average when compared to the entire population of shows on television.  The average television show is mediocre, but it is something that provides entertainment if you just want to come home from work and zone out on a mindless distraction to pass the time.   I found the characters to be rather stock (although Arthur seems to be miscast; he does not seem to be a kingly type). Aside from Arthur, everyone else fits a stereotypical mold and there's alot of overly dramatic acting. Others have commented about it being a low-budget production and that is how it seems to me - they have to keep the cameras in close to make it seem like there are a lot of people, but there really aren't that many people in the kingdom.   Overall, it's a forgettable series but it works as a diversion for an hour of entertainment in an evening.

1439192812|3.0|I live in the United States in the 21st century. There is no greater danger to our species and our civilization right now than religious crazies. How can we ask our businesses to change the way they do business so as to prevent climate change if half of the country doesn't believe in scientific evidence? Or worse yet, if they expect a big bearded man to come down and bail us out if things get too bad?<br /><br />What about the people who believe that the world will end, in the next few years, with a war in the Middle East? What if their faith leads them to believe we should go to war to make this come about?<br /><br />Yes, these are scary people and there are a lot of them.<br /><br />I'd like to think that Mr. Dawkins had these people in mind when he wrote this book. It may be too late for the current generation who have turned their minds off and handed over their rational thought in exchange for \\"faith.\\" But perhaps the next generation can be saved in time, and with their help we CAN actually do the work necessary to make the world a better place?<br /><br />From that perspective, this is an important and incredible book. It is a blow struck for logic over foolishness.<br /><br />But all the way through, I did find myself having mixed feelings. I don't think Mr. Dawkins really understands the purpose of the old myths and legends. The distinction between fairy tales and mythology seems to be missing from his understanding. When the old stories about the \\"gods\\" and nature of reality were written, they were neither meant to be \\"just so stories\\" nor were all of them intended to take the place of science. While he chooses to use the myths throughout his book to make his own book more entertaining, he clearly looks down on them and shows no consciousness that there is a deeper level of meaning to be found in mythology: the realm of the psychological. I would suggest he sit down and re-read his Joseph Campbell. The mythological creation of the world, the end of the world, the nature of mythological reality was never meant to be science. It was often meant to represent the internal journey of mankind.<br /><br />On page 202 he writes, \\"We don't have to invent wildly implausible stories: we have the joy and excitement of real scientific investigation and discovery to keep our imaginations in line. And in the end that is more exciting than fantasy.\\" Why do we need to keep our imaginations in line? Can't we mature to the point at which we are able to partake in scientific investigation on Mondays and mythological investigation on Wednesdays? Can't we be trusted to learn the difference and keep them apart?<br /><br />Science cannot help us with questions of existence. It will never help us with \\"How ought I act?\\" or \\"What meaning can I find in my life?\\" \\"What happens after we die?\\" \\"How can I find happiness?\\" But perhaps the ancient knowledge, allied with philosophy, can be of some use with these (more important) problems?<br /><br />There are snide remarks here and there aimed at Astrology, aliens, and such. He may be right about many of them, but the attacks lack any logical depth.<br /><br />Overall, I would certainly recommend this book to any and all children of the right reading level, but I would also want to talk to that child as they were reading it. Maybe take them for a walk in the woods and teach them about talking to the trees. There certainly is more in the world we actually experience than is dreamnt of in Mr. Dawkins' science.<br /><br />Dave McKean, as always, is a master.

B003Y5H574|3.0|I am different than the other reviewers, because I went to the movie expecting it to be funny and entertaining. I saw Evan Almighty, and Get Smart, and thought this would be along the same line. This is more like \\"The Office\\" type humor.  I admit that I didn't see any previews or reviews.   Everyone that told me they liked this movie also told me about Ryan Gossling's bare chest. If you are interested in more than that read on.   I think why so many people like this movie is because of the sincere vulnerability of Steve Carell's character. His wife is the only woman he loved and he is honest about it.    Is this suitable for a 13 year old? A teen age boy jerking off, a teenage girl taking nude pictures of herself, a wife cheating on her husband, a man sleeping with a different woman every night, a boy who thinks his dad is a rival for a teenage girl's affections, a man having sex with his son's teacher? I don't think so. On many levels this is a crude movie.   Is it better than \\"Hall Pass\\"?  Yes, definitely. One of the best movies this year? Not in my opinion.

0439023521|5.0|My 13 year old daughter's friends were reading this book and recommended it to her.  We couldn't find this book in any any of the bookstores near our house or any of the libraries either, they were all out and most were already on reserve.    I ordered this book from Amazon and received the book 2 days later.  My daughter read it first and couldn't put it down.  Between homework, school, soccer and meals....  she always had the book in her hands reading.  As soon as she finished she handed it to me and told me that I must read it too.  A few parents of some of her friends told me that they read it too and they all liked it as well.  I started reading and couldn't put the book down either.  Finished reading it in record time.  Have now passed on to a friend of mine to read as well.
1609611543|4.0|Reading this book was especially well timed for me as I had been having some digestive issues that perplexed me. Some months prior to treading this book I had begun to think that I was having an issue with gluten - and possibly with sugar.  I think we have all read or heard about the national problem of obesity and I think we've all also heard or read articles about gluten intolerance and the glycemic index.<br /><br />The book is about gluten and how it affects your body. It gives the reasons that the gluten we have at the present is genetically different than the wheat that was milled generations ago. Reading this book was like reading a time-line of spreading waist-lines. It all just clicked for. Fascinating stuff - the why's and wherefores of the changing characteristics of something as basic as wheat.<br /><br />Reading this book was a revelation - making me wish that there were more doctors like Dr. Davis around. I am not significantly over weight and I realized that I could not totally give up gluten right away simply because of my household, but that I could constrain the amount of gluten I consumed.I decided to try that approach and see what happened. I cut down my gluten consumption significantly and also began to take a digestive enzyme supplement and was thoroughly surprised to find that my symptoms decreased dramatically. I proved Dr. Davis' theory to myself. I went to my old ways of consuming more gluten and the problem returned. Now I plan to see how much gluten I can eliminate - using a good book on gluten free cooking.<br /><br />This book is well written, holds your attention and makes some very salient points. I am so pleased that the book found it way into my hands - at just the right time too !

As this fourteen-year-old boy's uncle dies, the police claim it is a car crash. But Ian Rider, Alex's self-contained, quiet uncle, has always been extremely safe. So, Alex Rider doubts that the police are telling the truth. Why would the police lie to him? To find out more, Alex goes to the junkyard that Ian Rider's car was put in and finds the front seat spattered with blood and bullet holes in the back window. Alex knows someone murdered his uncle, but who, and why?   Alex joins a spy agency that Ian worked for before, though Alex had assumed his uncle worked for the bank. He goes on a exciting adventure to a crazy man's factory that the manager, Alan Blunt, a man who shows no emotion whatsoever, is suspicious about. At first, Alex thinks Alan is wrong and there's nothing wrong at the factory. But he soon discovers the Stormbreaker, a deadly but extremely useful invention in the form of a computer that can really help school children. But is this seemingly normal man about to destroy every school child in England, or is he just an innocent man making a useful computer to help school children in England learn basic subjects? Read Stombreaker to find out!
0553807919|5.0|I began using the strategies in this book the first day I started reading it and they not only work, but have opened up an entire new conversation between me & my two boys (8 & 4 years old). This book offers parents practical understanding of their children's development and brain along with a plethora of ideas for implementing their strategies. It is amazing how my children have come up with their own ideas for making shifts in their day when their brain is not integrated.  I have been a huge fan of Dan's for years and recommend this book highly to anyone living with or working with children.
B002LFPAUC|4.0|[[ASIN:B002LFPAUC Fawlty Towers: The Complete Collection Remastered]]  The programming is excellent. However the BBC previews that precede the episodes are long and are restricted so you cannot skip through them. If you watch the episodes more than once, as we do, it is boring having to watch the previews each time. We have the earlier edition also and it does not have this problem. If we could skip the previews I would give it five stars.

0525423281|4.0|Really 4.5 stars<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is the companion novel to Anna and the French Kiss, which I absolutely loved. (You can read my review here.) For those of you who haven't read Anna, you can still enjoy Lola, but there are a few scenes you will appreciate even more if you have read the first one, because Anna does make an appearance here.<br /><br />Lola only has three wishes in life, one of which involves her dress for a dance, and one of which is to never see the Bell twins again. So when Calliope and Cricket Bell move back into the house next to hers, Lola tries to avoid them at all costs. She has plenty of other things to think about, like designing her dress and convincing her parents that her rockstar boyfriend, Max, is really a good guy. Lola and Cricket have history that she'd rather forget. Only she can't avoid himm, and she can't forget the past. She finds herself growing closer to Cricket again, despite knowing that she shouldn't have feelings for him while she is with Max. Lola knows that she will have to make a choice, but which choice would truly be following her heart?<br /><br />After reading Anna, I could not wait to read this book. Stephanie has a way of making her characters come to life and making you feel every one of their emotions. Lola may not have been a typical girl, with her eye for fashion and flair for the eccentric, but she seems very real. She was raised in a home with two dads due to her biological mother's inability to care for her, and as such she already deals with more than the average teen. While Lola is quirky and fun, she she truly wants to be a good person, one who is loyal to and doesn't disappoint those whom she loves. These qualities made her incredibly vivid, and while I loved Cricket and obviously wanted her to be with him instead of Max, I was on the emotional rollercoaster with her as she weighed her decisions and finally came to understand what was right for her. Did I mention that I loved Cricket? Because he is definitely swoon-worthy. Just like St. Clair, he's not the stereotypical hot guy; he likes building Rube Goldberg devices, his pants are a little too short sometimes, and he's almost always in the shadow of his sister. But those imperfections make him that much more endearing. And as I said earlier, I loved that Anna and St. Clair made appearances in this novel.<br /><br />Although I really enjoyed this novel, and it is definitely a romance, Lola does deal with some tougher issues than Anna did because of her family. Also, I have to admit that I missed the setting from Anna; while San Francisco is great, it just doesn't compare to Paris. Despite that, it is Lola's emotional journey that really makes this story great.<br /><br />Once again Stephanie Perkins has crafted an engaging story of life and love with both laughter and tears along with way. Just like Anna's world, Lola's world is one that you will want to visit again. I can't wait to see who Stephanie introduces us to next!n-worthy.

B004AUGJS8|2.0|While others see Gosling as having done a great job, my own response is that he did, if what he was going for was boring.  His character should have been interesting.  Instead I found it so boring that it was impossible for me to believe in Dunst's devotion to him.  As a result I didn't care about any of the characters.  I found the movie long, boring, and disjointed.
1592536913|1.0|This book is full of kitsch. There is rarely any real creation that encompasses the real beauty of Steampunk. If I say that Steampunk is just a way of gluing old rusty cogs together with some other trash you find in the attic, then this book would be perfect. But its not. The power of Steampunk is in the fact that one person can create fully functional fabrications, from materials like wood, brass, glass, leather ... without the use of hi tech. This is just some art crap pilled together... but that's just my point of view... of course.

B002VKE0XA|3.0|Paranormal Activity is a film about a couple, Katie and Micah, and their experience being haunted by a demon.  Although the film starts off slowly as the plot is sketched out, about a third of the way into the film (when you start witnessing the paranormal activity for yourself) you are drawn into the film and can really enjoy it.  The film is based on the \\"found footage\\" premise made famous my The Blair Witch Project.  The viewer is told that this is a true story at the beginning, which adds to you caring about the characters and events in the film.  The film is legitimately scary with a terrific ending...if you can get past the 30 minute mark you will enjoy it, but if you have a short attention span or need a whole lot of action, then avoid this movie - it's a character centric movie rather than action or special effects focused.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the movie, the extras were simply non-existant.  The only extra was an alternate ending.  This film could have used a commentary as the story behind the film is exceptional.  The director used his own home for the film, the actors were paid only $500, one of the actors was actually the cameraman, and the film is one of the most profitable films of all time.  It would have been interesting to hear how the director came up with the idea, what led him to utilize the found footage premise, and how the minimal special effects were done.<br /><br />I recommend that anyone interested in scary movies watch this - it's better at night curled up in bed, since most of the action takes place late at night in the couple's bedroom - but it is not a must own since there are no extras to make it a worthwhile purchase.
B005FUTBV4|3.0|As a fan of Kevin Smith's I was looking forward to Red State. However, the film is a disappointment and I can not recommend it.<br />What should be a simple story of a Waco-like siege on a group of religious extremists is borderline incoherent due to a number of tonal shifts.<br />While the acting is sublime, particularly the performances by Michael Parks and John Goodman, they are wasted on such an uneven script. Other fine characters, like Stephen Root's conflicted police chief are introduced and then cast aside.<br />Much has been made of funnyman Kevin Smith branching out and making a serious horror/thriller. While he succeeds in creating an arresting visual style, due to his direction and taut editing, he should have collaborated with another writer that understands the genre better.
B001R4MEUM|5.0|The art and genius of the album cover of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway is a small hint of how good the music inside is going to be. In no ways subtle, complicated and stirring; every song is a soul's departure to exactly where we want music to take us. Lyric imagery and mood stimulation are different here than anywhere else to the point that this album could be its own category. From some of music's well sung heroes, here is some music that is rock's best kept secret.

B0041KKYEW|4.0|(Feb. 22, 2012) I discovered a clip on You Tube from 1968 that was danced on a sound stage. I have wondered where Nina's prologue was copied. This looks very much like it. Nina herself gives the hint when she says \\"I Had the craziest dream last night. I was dancing the White Swan. It was different choreography though, more like the Bolshoi.\\" I Googled Amazon and found the 1968 version is still available. SWAN LAKE - YEVTEYEVA; KIROV BALLET, DUDKO. DVD released by AM@DO. See my review of same.<br />  (Oct. 9, 2011) Schizoid paraphrenic delusions. I had to pause-step-step-step to catch images so fleeting I wondered if I were delusional. But no, Nina sees herself everywhere, not just in mirrors where split images abound but on other persons bodies, (caution: spoilers), on the woman in the construction sidewalk cover; on the pas de quatre small swans dancers. She also kills \\"herself\\" in the dressing room scene. I had to step-step-step through this scene several times to catch it. As well as the bedroom scene. Finally; does Lily even exist? Or maybe I'm delusional after all?<br />  (Nov 11, 2011). I bought this when it was released on Blu Ray and have viewed it several times. Today I was watching again when the night club dance sequence began. I paused-step-step-stepped slowly through and discovered there is a lot going on in Nina's mind. All sorts of curiously psychotic images. Did I see Elvis' face pasted on another's body? Maybe.<br />  There is one very indicative scene. when Nina returns to the apartment, the image of Nina in the mirror is divided down the middle, but then (alter ego)Lily \\"peels\\" herself off and goes to stand in the hallway. No other spoilers; you will have to slow step through these sequences yourself, It took about a half hour but was well worth the effort. I love this movie. It has only a passing reference to Swan Lake, though.  I also love Swan Lake. Go figure.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|All six movies were great especially in HD. Episodes 1-6 was awesomes in HD. All the films looked better and I was impress with new affects made to it. I didn't mind the changes in episode IV and VI. But they shoulda have fixed all the lightsaber in episode 4-6. In episode IV, they should have fixed luke's saber better when he was on the falcon and fix the obi-won saber when he was facing darth vader. Same thing for Episode V. Other than that, the films would have looked great.
B0049P1ZZQ|1.0|I realize that I'm going against the grain here, but I couldn't stand this show.  As another reviewer said, the first episode was quite good.  It sucked after that!  I had to quit in the middle of the series.  The characters are extremely one-dimensional, and everything that happened was incredibly predictable.  All of this is coming from a huge, life-long fan of horror films and books.  I spent much of my time watching this show thinking \\"yep...  I've seen that before.\\"  Or \\"I bet this'll happen next!\\"  Sure enough, my predictions usually transpired.<br /><br />The Good:  Nice visuals and beautiful cinematography.  Even though I didn't like the show, it looks great in HD!<br />The Bad:  One-dimensional characters, highly-predictable story line and the audio effects were way too over-the-top.<br /><br />My recommendation:  If you're gonna watch this, try not to spend too much money!

B0052GACNM|5.0|Considering that Tony was following in the steps of Frank Sinatra in putting out duet albums in the sunset of his career, my expectations were not very high.  Sinatra's last duet effort was atrocious but Tony exceeded my expectations and it's hard to believe that you're listening to an 85 year old crooner.  His partners that included a wide range of singing styles from Lada Gaga to Andrea Bocelli and Willie Nelson and with a couple of exceptions, they all rose to the occasion and freshened up the old popular standards.  Overall, it's a four star performance from Tony and company but I'm giving it a bonus star to balance out the teavangelical trolls coming on to bash to Tony with 1 star ratings.  Rate the man's music not his politics.
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|First off, the trailers didn't quite sell the movie to me, so I went in the theater today with low expectations. I left pleasantly surprised...<br /><br />It's set in the near future where boxing and even mixed martial arts doesn't display enough carnage for audiences. They turn to 8 foot robots controlled by human \\"trainers\\" to get their fix. Hugh Jackman turns in one of his best non-Wolverine performances as a no good father and former boxer who now uses fighting robots to make (or in his case lose) money. He chooses to sell his son, left alone after his mother died, for $100,000 to the boy's Aunt and Uncle. But first he has to spend a couple of months with him while the boy's future guardians are in Europe. It turns out that his 11-year-old knows even more than he does about robotic fighting. They end up stumbling upon an older model bot (named Atom) in a junk yard and from there they begin to train it and almost in Rocky like fashion Atom becomes a crowd favorite and gets a shot at the title. I thought the boy actor was excellent as well. He had a lot of attitude, but he never got annoying. Evangeline Lilly of Lost fame is here to showcase her beautiful face, but doesn't get much more to do than be a love interest for Jackman's character.<br /><br />The CGI is great. Unlike most scenes in the Transformers movies, you can actually tell the robots apart and the action is easy to follow.<br /><br />Sure it has the usual corny moments and the giant robots fighting in a ring sometimes comes off silly, but I really enjoyed Real Steel. It sometimes feels like an emotional family film about the relationship between a boy and his father, but it doesn't get too sappy and there is plenty of action to balance out all of the feel good stuff. Overall, I was never bored and it was more fun than I expected it to be.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Thor doesn't stray far from the basic premise of the source material, and like the Iron Man franchise, uses similarly clever writing that attempts to ground its fantasy in something closer to reality. There is sparse, but surprisingly well used humor - even a spot or two of nicely done slapstick.<br /><br />Thor is a pretty straight forward story of a disgraced son, redemption, dark family secrets, and betrayal. It's done with a nice even pacing. It has enough action to satisfy viewers looking for that, while having some well acted drama that's not too heavy for this type of comic book movie, nor is it so light that it feels awkward or misplaced. I credit Marvel's excellent production and quality control along with Kenneth Branagh's direction. No complaints about any of the casting choices, and even the smallest parts are well acted.<br /><br />The setting and costumes are vivid and imaginative. When I saw early leaked photos from the set I was afraid that much of the movie would look bad. I was pleasantly surprised at how good everything looked after the movie magic was applied. The score is nothing to write home about, I suppose, but it's serviceable.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Thor, enough to pick up the Bluray on the day of release. I think it will appeal to a large cross section of movie viewers, enough to make it worthy of your library as something you could pop in to watch with just about anyone.

B00571F26Y|5.0|I actually read this book because I thought my boss had recommended it.  Turns out it was a completely different book, but I'm glad I made the mistake.  Wheat Belly has a lot of good science explained in a manner that works for laymen and scientists alike.  I'm impressed.  Wheat Belly gives a history of wheat, and tells why it's not the wheat from thousands of years ago or even 100 years ago.  It explains the genetic changes made and why it isn't as simple as the usual hybrid found in other farmed food sources.  The book also does a great job covers the impact of these changes on our modern bodies and lists studies showing what happens to us with and without wheat.  Having been wheat-free since just a few months before the book came out, I'm happy to see a source of information for others considering its effect on their lives.

B005F6NA5G|5.0|I have my own thoughts. But only George Benson knows how he can do what he does all these years and still have that great batting average in terms of the quality. After his previous album [[ASIN:B002G4FQI4 Songs & Stories]],which by the high I very very highly recommend I don't know if I had many expectations there would be another album by him for awhile. In all honesty this came as something of a surprise. When I found out it was a collection of standards I wondered if it would be a cliched project. Well that lasted for one second when I realize that THIS WAS GEORGE BENSON WE'RE TALKING ABOUT! And his abilities as an interpretive musician are more than well documented on projects such as his 1969 release [[ASIN:B0000062P2 Other Side of Abbey Road]]. Not only that I was delighted to see the song choices he made-realizing there are now many generations of standards to cover,not just one and even including new ones from after the turn of the millennium. By setting the songs up this way he helps us realize that quality music still exists out there. And in HIS hands? Well I'll tell you!<br /><br />  True it's really hard to lose anytime Paul Jackson,Joe Sample,Harvey Mason and Lenny Castro get involved. But this an amazing session. The sound quality is particularly strong! Even though some songs feature either solo performances or a different array of personnel producer John Burk really let go on this one,allowing the production to be wide open and crisp even as Benson makes a killing across amazingly re harmonized solo guitar pieces such as \\"Tenderly\\" and \\"Danny Boy\\",two highlights. With the full band in tow though,he does the same thing to \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" with a great soul-jazz flavor to boot;it's often hard to tell this came from John,Paul,George and Ringo originally-Benson is such a superb improviser on that one. \\"My Cherie Amour\\" and his take on Norah Jones \\"Don't Know Why\\",but especially as accompanied by the Bossa Nova percussion of Castro on the Stevie Wonder song the flair he gives to the melody is still classic Benson all the way. His take on \\"The Lady In My Life\\" though? A whole other thing. Stripping out the heavier production of the original,this is basically a slickly produced live instrumental version-with Benson's elastic guitar playing the role of MJ's elastic vocals.<br /><br />  \\"Tequila\\" is a bit of a surprising song but a great party number done up again with more of a funky soul jazz flavor than the hard edged roadhouse rocking R&B of the original. You can really see the musicians are excited and genuinely having fun here. And the fact that it sounds fun doesn't take away from the brilliance of the musicianship. There's an upbeat quartet version of \\"Paper Moon\\" along with \\"Since I Fell For You\\"-just Benson and David Garfield on piano showcasing that Benson's creamy,elastic voice-always very close to his guitar sound. And the closer with Ronnie Foster's \\"Fingerlero\\"? SMOKING SMOKING SMOKING! We're talking serious,melodic latin funk here and it all times out perfect. So in the end this is a terrific album,different in nature from but every bit the equal to his previous album. George Benson's a guy that's always come and gone in terms of releases. But he's been in rare form during this period. Can't wait to hear what the \\"guitar man\\" is going to come up with next!r song the flair he gives to the melody is still classic Benson all the way.

B005N0PJJO|5.0|From behindtherows.com<br /><br />Hot times Fifty!  E. L. James has done it again with her second installment of the Fifty Shades series.  Christian and Ana are back and sexier than ever.  The first book left us with a cliffhanger that made me scream at the pages like a banshee wanting more.<br />I am happy to report that Ana and Christian do get back together (oh, come on... it had to happen or there wouldn't be a series) and explore their relationship on a whole new level.  Pushing boundaries has never been a problem for Christian Grey, except for when it comes to romance.  In this book he now has to dig deep into the emotional pool to keep what he wants and what he wants is Ana.<br />Between unwanted attention from a creepy boss and an ex that wont go away, this dynamic duo find themselves in situations that leave much to be desired.  There may also be some steamy sex thrown in as well.<br />I was so happy to see Ana become more comfortable in her skin and stand up for what she believes in.  I think this book showcases her strength as a woman and it's nice to see her fight for the man she loves.<br />Christian is just sizzling.  There I said it, I have a crush on a make believe character in a book.  That's ok, because he embodies everything women fantasize about.  Strong, rich, capable of just about everything, seductive eyes, and a little kinky side (alright, a rather extensive kinky side)... what was I talking about again?<br />James has a way to include the reader in what the characters are feeling.  This series is, dare I say, one of the best of the genre.<br />I did feel like this book was a gateway to the next, but still excellent in it's own right.  I look forward to the final book as I'm sure it will all be wrapped up (or bound, whatever) in a nice package.  I also can't wait to see what adventures these two have in store for the future.
B000002KLG|5.0|Quincy Jones was not only a busy man during the late 70's and early 80's but was also something of a musical Rumpelstiltskin-almost mysteriously able to spin straw into gold,only doing so with music. And I'm not talking about in the commercial sense either. With all the ingredients present,from engineering master Bruce Swedien to of course equally masterful composer Rod Temperton-not to mention the mega session approach Q was so famous for by bringing in Herbie Hancock,Louis Johnson,Richard Tee,Greg Phillinganes,Lee Ritenour (yes it's even better than it sounds) this album was already set for greatness. Not to mention the star of the show George Benson. Already at the top of his game before this making excellent albums in varied styles from [[ASIN:B004C4IKB6 White Rabbit]] all the way up to [[ASIN:B000002KHU Breezin]],this album by it's nature,pairing George and Quincy Jones came off looking like a musical miracle just waiting to happen. Interesting part is,as good as that sounds already it actually gets BETTER than even that!<br /><br />  I look at this album the way I once heard EWF's music is described. On this album George plays funk sweet as funk can be. Not the sugary or saccharine type of sweet. But the sweetness of clean,bluesy jazz playing and some of the most inventive jazz-funk compositions imaginable. \\"Love x Love\\" is a perfect example-sleek and crispy at the same time with a groove that's spare but glossy all at once. Of course many of us know the title song,of course right there in the same wonderful place. Than again,so it's \\"What's On Your Mind\\",the instrumental \\"Dinorah Dinorah\\" and \\"Midnight Love Affair\\". These bring to mind something of a cross between MJ's [[ASIN:B00005QGAT Off the Wall]] meeting up with the a Crusaders albums such as [[ASIN:B000003N56 Street Life]]-definitely high strutting uptown urban sophistifunk of the highest quality. And we're not done yet! \\"Off Broadway\\" is deeper,heavier funk with this defining bass moog-one of the best productions jobs I've ever heard and my personal favorite number on this album (actually up there with the title song). And of course he's at his same slinky best on slower numbers such as his famed jazzy take on \\"Moody's Mood\\" and the extremely sensual \\"Love Dance\\" and \\"Turn Out The Lamplight\\". Not to mention the level he takes Heatwave's \\"Star Of A Story\\". These are cosmically arranged pieces with decidedly adult takes on romance. And it all makes up for one killer album!<br /><br />  As great as this album is creatively,the amazing thing about it is that it hit as much commercial paydirt as anything Michael Jackson or any of the other Qwest releases of this era did. It's the middle of that Quincy Jones 1979-1981 sandwich that starts with [[ASIN:B00005QGAT Off the Wall]] and ends roughly with Patti Austin's [[ASIN:B003UI50CM Every Home Should Have One]]. And the most wonderful thing about it all is that this is one of the more thoroughly musical of the three albums-the other two of which concentrate heavily on songcraft and vocal performance. This one does just the same way. But the focus is very much on George's playing and singing. And those are two talents he always had to his advantage. There's aren't many artists in any genre who can play an instrument and sing quite with the amazing quality as George Benson does. He's definitely one of those \\"everything\\" men who can do them both and both very well. And even though the coming decade would be filled with some equally huge musical highs and lows due in part to the enormous success this album earned him,he'd be able to learn a lot from albums such as this later and realize the creative ingredients that...well really make the best music commercially as well.ons jobs I've ever heard and my personal favorite number on this album (actually up there with the title song).

It's a very fast read, good prose, nice interplay between Reacher and the Sheriff...a lady.  This would be a good one to start the series as it is set in 1997.  A real page turner.

Unfortunately, this movie fails to offer any character to root for, any character that behaves rationally, or any situation that deserves laughter or praise.<br /><br />Kate Hudson's Darcy is marrying Tom Cruise look-alike Dex (Collin Egglesfield), but best friend Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) sleeps with Dex as the movie opens. That's the major conflict. Does Rachel really love Dex? How does Dex feel about Rachel. Can either of them break the news to Darcy? The plot is decent enough, except there is more, including the incredibly pointless Ethan (John Krasinski). Why he is in this movie? Oh, this movie is based on a book, and his character probably had a reason for existing in the book, but not in the movie.<br /><br />There really isn't any reason to watch the romantic comedy released in the summer. If you must have one, it is Ginnifer Goodwin. She's cute and a good actress and fun to watch. Unfortunately, the story gives none of the cast any favors as it seems to last forever and in the end makes no sense.
1439192812|5.0|Richard Dawkins and David McKean have made my holiday shopping this year easy. Indeed, if I could pick but one book as required reading for every adolescent and adult in the world, it would be The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True.<br /><br />Why am I so evangelistic about this book? Because it expands and deepens the powerful open letter that Richard wrote in the mid 1990s to his (at the time) ten-year-old daughter Juliet, \\"Good and Bad Reasons for Believing\\" (which is the last chapter in [[ASIN:0618485392 A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love]]). Now, just about anyone on the cusp of puberty and beyond can learn about their deep ancestry, why there are so many animals, what causes earthquakes, what powers the sun and the stars, why rainstorms sometimes produce rainbows, and even \\"why bad things happen.\\" Who can read this book and fail to see science as one of humanity's shining achievements!<br /><br />Early in chapter 1, which is titled \\"What Is Reality? What Is Magic?,\\" Dawkins lays out in a few simple paragraphs a key distinction: \\"Magic is a slippery word: It is commonly used in three different ways... I'll call the first one `supernatural magic,' the second one `stage magic,' and the third one (which is my favorite meaning, and the one I intend in my title) `poetic magic'.\\"<br /><br />Crucially, perhaps because youth are his intended audience, Dawkins maintains a tone throughout that is in no way derisive of anyone's mythic story -- including the mythic story that has been deployed for far too long in Western culture to prevent school children from learning that all creatures are their cousins and that it is a fact of chemistry that they are made of star stuff.<br /><br />I do believe that, if read far and wide, this book could go a long way toward curing our species of its current collective insanity. Consider this recent statement by my fellow religious naturalist and noted philosopher of religion, Loyal Rue:<br /><br />\\"The most profound insight in the history of humankind is that we should seek to live in accord with reality. Indeed, living in harmony with reality may be accepted as a formal definition of wisdom. If we live at odds with reality (foolishly), then we will be doomed. But if we live in proper relationship with reality (wisely), we shall be saved. Humans everywhere, and at all times, have had at least a tacit understanding of this fundamental principle. What we are less in agreement about is how we should think about reality and what we should do to bring ourselves into harmony with it.\\"<br /><br />The Magic of Reality is a stunning example of our best collective intelligence about the nature of reality and how we've come to know (rather than merely believe) that science provides a more accurate map of \\"what's real\\" and \\"what's important\\" (or, how things are and which things matter) than ancient mythic maps could hope to achieve. I would argue that nothing is more necessary at this time in history than for people of all ages, backgrounds, and beliefs to grasp the importance of distinguishing mythic and meaningful stories of reality from the measurable and meaningful truth of reality.<br /><br />After all, isn't the ability to distinguish one's inner, subjective world from the outer, objective world pretty much the defining mark of sanity? When a person cannot consistently do this, we say that he or she has become a danger to self and others. When a large and media savvy segment of an entire culture insists on selectively using (and selectively ignoring) the discoveries of science, the danger is vastly compounded.<br /><br />Clearly and compellingly helping readers draw a distinction between myth and reality (while valuing both) is what The Magic of Reality does so brilliantly--and beautifully! Richard Dawkins' steady prose and helpful metaphors combine with Dave McKean's stunning illustrations to make this volume a feast for head and heart.<br /><br />As I've written and spoken about many times during the past two years (for example, see my \\"Thank God for the New Atheists\\" sermon that was simultaneously published in Skeptic magazine and Australasian Science), I consider Richard Dawkins and many of his New Atheist colleagues to be modern-day prophets.  Traditionally, prophets were not so much foreseers or foretellers.  They were men and women who spoke boldly and unflinchingly on behalf of reality. Their message (couched in religious terms, of course) was essentially this: \\"Here's what's real, folks--and here's what's emerging. We need to get right with reality, or perish.\\"<br /><br />In the same way that the writings of Martin Luther and John Calvin helped spark the Protestant Reformation five centuries ago, I see Richard Dawkins' and David McKean's book helping 21st century religious folk to break free of idolatry of the written word and thereby spark an Evidential Reformation.<br /><br />It is on this point that I depart from Dawkins. I truly do wish for reform of all the world's religious heritages--not annihilation.  And I wish for reform not just because reform is a more practical and realistic approach for smoothing out the harsh edges of literalistic religious zealotry. Rather, I work for reform because religions, historically, have had an important cultural evolutionary role to play.<br /><br />Following evolutionist David Sloan Wilson (author of [[ASIN:0226901351 Darwin's Cathedral: Evolution, Religion, and the Nature of Society]] and [[ASIN:0385340923 Evolution for Everyone: How Darwin's Theory Can Change the Way We Think About Our Lives]], I understand that religions evolved, in part, to make possible vastly larger scales of cooperation than kin selection and reciprocal altruism tend to produce on their own. More, religions that could evoke individual sacrifice in the interest of shared goals were those that helped their societies defend territory, conquer the less fortunate, and adequately provision generations to come.<br /><br />Thus, in a heretical way perhaps, I regard Richard Dawkins as not only a gift to our species but as the boot in the butt my own Christian heritage requires to stay relevant--and to have anything useful at all to pass on to the young people who increasingly listen, globally, more to each other than to their immediate elders.<br /><br />It is now up to those very same young people to make The Magic of Reality go viral!<br /><br />[To see a richly illustrated video commentary \\"an inside look at The Magic of Reality\\" that my wife Connie Barlow just posted on YouTube, put into google \\"youtube dawkins barlow\\".]od for the New Atheists\\" sermon that was simultaneously published in Skeptic magazine and Australasian Science), I consider Richard Dawkins and many of his New Atheist colleagues to be modern-day prophets.

B005BZQS1E|1.0|This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen.  I didn't make it past the pedophiliac alien sex when we decided that, not only was it bad, it wasn't even making us laugh.  It just made us angry that we spent two dollars.  My spouse said \\"Well, it wasn't the worst - it wasn't as bad as Highlander II\\".<br /><br />Look, we're laidback people who enjoy a funny movie.  Like, say, [[ASIN:B0050PYNP8 Paul]].<br /><br />Consider yourself forewarned.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Excellent game in terms of level design and execution. The puzzles are challenging but not too tough. The biggest problem you will have is if you (like me) have fat fingers. Some of the puzzles require precise tapping of the screen and can be quite frustrating if not done correctly. I suppose a tablet would help some of these issues but if you are playing this game on a phone with fat fingers,  you've been warned. Would definitely be a 5 star app if this issue was not so common among the more advanced levels.

B004EPYZQC|3.0|This one was different from the rest. There was a lot more drama, and talking, mixed with some action. I guess I had high hopes for even A LITTLE more racing scenes is this whole movie.  It was more of an action movie with guns and muscles than what the original The Fast and The Furious started with.  Even though the director said they're trying to \\"evolve\\", get away from the racing stuff. It was a little disappointing to only see one real race, which wasn't exciting at all.  Then when you think there's going to be a race, they edit it out completely.  Probably because we know whose going to win in the end, sure, but it's still fun to watch.  \\"The Rock\\" (Dwayne Johnson) was a great addition to the movie. His character in this playing \\"Hobbs\\" was hunting down Dom, Brian and the team.  Also bringing back some of the other characters from the four movies before his one was a great addition.  I don't know, you be the judge.  If you like action movies with guns blazing mixed with some standard cars and destruction. Then you may like this movie.  If you only liked the other other fast and furious movies before this because of the street racing, cars, or feel of it.  You may or may not be disappointed.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Fun to spend some time saving trapped insects. Worth a buck to be entertained for a few hours. Cheaper than synthetic drugs.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|\\"North by Northwest\\" (1959) is one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest films, and I think it's his most sophisticated, sharp, classy thriller. It's actually very light and comedic, not dark and serious, which makes it very entertaining. It's considered the fourth most thrilling film of all time on AFI's \\"100 Years...100 Movies\\" list, and it very much deserves it.    The film is about a Madison Avenue advertising executive named Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) who gets mistaken for being a man named George Kaplan, and after that suddenly gets caught up in a web of murder, abduction, and romance, which takes him to the United Nations (where Hitch wasn't supposed to film in but snuck a camera in to film) to Chicago to a countryside in a famous sequence where Cary Grant gets attacked by a cropduster all the way to Mount Rushmore, with the suspensful and classic ending. James Mason perfectly plays the villain, Philip Vandamm. Eva Marie Saint plays the typical Hitchcock blonde, Eve Kendall, a counterspy who falls in love with Roger, and Jessie Royce Landis plays Roger's mother, who just happened to be the same age as Cary Grant.     This has to be Hitch's most entertaining film with top-notch acting from Cary Crant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Martin Landau, and Leo G. Carroll. It also has a fast pace, great Hitchcockian humor, an amazing plot, wonderful sets, and witty dialouge.     The special features here are absolutely incredible. The Disc 1 has a commentary by screenwriter, Ernest Lehman and a music only audio track. The Disc 2 is special features galore. It comes with a 1 1/2 hour documentary \\"Cary Grant: A Class Apart\\", which chronicles Cary Grant's life and legendary film career, all the way to his death. It shows a lot of film clips all the way from \\"She Done Him Wrong\\" to \\"Walk, Don't Run\\". It's phenomenal. \\"The Master's Touch: Hitchcock's Signature Style\\" is an interesting hour long documentary about Hitch's legendary filming style, showing film clips from different films like \\"Dial M for Murder\\", \\"Strangers on a Train\\", and \\"North by Northwest\\". The other 2 special features are about the making of the film: \\"North by Northwest: One for the Ages\\" and \\"Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North by Northwest. The rest are production photos and theatrical trailers, which are pretty fun to see.    \\"North by Northwest\\" is no doubt one of Hitch's best films, and some even consider it his best. It definitely is one of my favorites. It has everything that a Hitchcock film should have: suspense, humor, sharp acting/actors, witty dialouge, and a classic MacGuffin. If you haven't seen this, you have to see it NOW!
B004SKHJF2|5.0|I love shazam! works great. 99% of the songs I want looked up are on here. would recommend this to everyone.
0783240236|5.0|\\"The Birds\\" (1963) is the first Hitchcock film I've seen, and I'm so glad I've seen it, because it started my Hitchcock film collection, and it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I also think that it's one of the greatest horror films of all time.    Tippi Hedren, in her breakout role, plays Melanie Daniels, a socialite who meets Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor), a lawyer at a birdshop. Later on, Melanie goes to Bodega Bay, wher Mitch spends the weekend with his mother, Lydia (Jessica Tandy), and his younger sister, Cathy (Veronica Cartwright), to give Mitch his pair of lovebirds he was looking for earlier at the birdshop. A couple days later, birds start to attack Bodega Bay, which causes destruction and terror all over the town, and truly heartstopping ending.    This is one of the films that made the whole \\"nature gone wrong\\" thing popular and it's a classic that you can watch over and over again. It's not scary now, but it still is very suspenseful and heart-pounding. Another great thing about this film is that it marks Tippi Hedren's first big role. She also appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Marnie\\" a year later.    The special features on this DVD are phenomenal. It comes with a 1 hour 17 minute documentary: \\"All About The Birds: An Original Documentary\\", where it talks about how the film was made, and it's pretty interesting. It has most of the original stars being interviewed, like Tippi Hedren, Rod Taylor, and Veronica Cartwright. It also comes with storyboards and stills of a deleted scene and the original ending, Tippi Hedren's screen test (which is very enjoyable), 2 different newsreels (The Birds is Coming, and National Press Club Hears Hitchcock), production photos/notes, and the 5 minute original theatrical trailer.     \\"The Birds\\" is a landmark classic that only Hitchcock could have done, and it still will be a classic another 50 years from now.
B001HPP2XW|5.0|Ever since I've first seen \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" (1961), it's been my favorite movie. Every time I see that taxi pull up at Tiffany's on Fifth Avenue in the early morning, with Audrey Hepburn coming out and window shopping while eating a pastry and drinking coffee, it makes me happy for some reason. I can just watch this film over and over and over again, because I think it's a perfect movie with great acting, characters, and, of course, I love Audrey Hepburn, and that iconic photo of her standing in that black dress with a cigarette holder. Marilyn Monroe was originally supposed to be Holly Golightly, but declined, and as much as I love Marilyn, I'm glad that Audrey Hepburn took the role, because she's my favorite actress and I can't imagine anybody else being Holly Golightly. This is definitely my favorite film of hers, and my favorite of all time.<br />  Audrey Hepburn plays Holly Golightly, her most iconic role. She's a 19-year old socialite (Audrey was really 31 at that time), who is also a call-girl that takes \\"50 dollars for the powder room\\". George Peppard plays Paul Varjak, a writer who moves into her apartment, and later on they fall in love, but it's complicated since she has a troubled past and is irresponsible. The other names in the cast include Patricia Neal, Buddy Ebsen, Martin Balsam, and Mickey Rooney as Mr. Yunioshi, a very controversial role.<br />  The special features to the Paramount Centennial Collection of this film are definitely worth watching. The Disc 1 comes with the film and a commentary by producer Richard Shephard. The Disc 2 comes with \\"A Golightly Gathering\\", a 20 minute featurette that reunites all of the cast members from the famous cocktail party scene (it took a whopping 8 days to film!). It's one of the best featurettes on the DVD. The second feature is \\"Henry Mancini: More than Music\\", a 21 minute featurette about the life and music of famous composer, Henry Mancini, who did \\"Moon River\\", the theme song to \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\". \\"Mr. Yunioshi: An Asian Perspective is a 17 minute featurette you probably should skip. I can see how the whole was controversial and upsetting, but there's a lot of not needed things in this film, like talk about World War II and different Asian actors in films. I know it kind of relates to the featurette, but it doesn't even relate to the film itself. \\"The Making of a Classic\\" is a 16 minute featurette that talks about how the film was made. It comes with a lot of good information and it was really enjoyable. \\"It's So Audrey: A Style Icon\\" has to be my favorite featurette on this whole DVD. It's 8 minutes long and has different interviews with designers and even her ex-husband, Mel Ferrer, along with her son, Sean Ferrer. It also shows clips from different films of hers, which is my favorite part of the feature. It shows movies like \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\", \\"Roman Holiday\\", \\"Sabrina\\", \\"Funny Face\\", and \\"Paris When it Sizzles\\", along with some cute photos of Audrey. \\"Beyond the Gates: The Tour\\", is a 4-5 minute featurette that tours beyond the gates of Paramount, and talks about the history of my favorite movie company of all time. \\"Brilliance in a Blue Box\\" is about 6 minutes, and it talks about the history of Tiffany & Co. It's very interesting. \\"Audrey's Letter to Tiffany\\" is only 2 minutes long, and it shows the letter she wrote to Tiffany's for it's 150th anniversary book in 1987. It also comes with the original theatrical trailer and production photographs, which are enjoyable, too. It also comes with an 8-page booklet, like all Centennial Collections have, full of great information and photos.<br />  Altogether, \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is a classic that has so many things that make the movie great, like Audrey Hepburn, a great supporting cast, great New York setting, some nice drama and romance, an iconic ending, and, of course, Cat, which is Audrey's cat in the film that she doesn't give a name to. \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is without a doubt a great romance, and one of the most iconic movies of all time. Happy 50th anniversary!e, and one of the most iconic movies of all time. Happy 50th anniversary!
034552554X|5.0|This is an amazing book.  I could not put it down.  The characters are compelling.  They are vividly drawn, and the plotline is very realistic.  There are too many books where the characters are unrealistically perfect Barbie and Ken types.  This book is about people with very real problems, pains and joys.  They feel very real, and it is hard to let go of the characters once the last page is turned.  The book was so well written, it seemed like a true story.  I found myself wanting to explore the area described in the book looking for the flower shop, vineyard and flower farm described in the book.<br /><br />Unforgettable book with memorable characters.

0307352145|5.0|First, look at this list from pg 5 in the introduction to this book:<br /><br />\\"Without introverts, the world would be devoid of<br /><br />the theory of gravity<br />the theory of relativity<br />W.B. Yeats's 'The Second Coming'<br />Chopin's nocturnes<br />Proust's 'In Search of Lost Time'<br />Peter Pan<br />Orwell's '1984' and 'Animal Farm'<br />The Cat in the Hat<br />Charlie Brown<br />'Schindler's List,' 'E.T.,' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'<br />Google<br />Harry Potter\\"<br /><br />Of course, that is only a tiny list of the accomplishments of introverts, and she forgot to put the Theory of Evolution in that list. Let's face it. One cannot expect people handicapped with extroversion to be able to think deeply or meditate over the serious philosophical, scientific, or supremely artistic subjects which move the deeper among us.<br /><br />Okay, maybe extroversion is not a handicap, but it is important to realize that introversion is no more a handicap than extroversion.  So, the extroverts deserve a retaliatory jab once in a while for treating introverts as though we are mentally and socially challenged.<br /><br />This book by Susan Cain is the ultimate jab, though she is sometimes overnice toward the ones that have promoted \\"The Extrovert Ideal\\" for more than a century in the U.S.  I do not believe I have read any better work dealing with the issue of personality than \\"Quiet.\\"<br /><br />There are some scientific points to be made in the book, with mention of studies that show how introversion or extroversion are biologically, genetically ingrained in us, though some of the studies (particularly the one mentioning literal \\"thin skin\\") strike me as somewhat irrelevant if not pseudoscientific.  Some of the best information has to do with twin studies, particularly notable for showing the error of \\"blank slate\\" theory.  See also [[ASIN:0142003344 The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature]] by Steven Pinker.  I am a little puzzled there was no mention of Pinker in this book, even in the footnotes.<br /><br />I am tempted to go through all of the subjects covered in this book and give a summary, but better than that is the list of thoughts from Susan Cain's blog, which will give an idea of the thrust of the book:<br /><br />1. There's a word for \\"people who are in their heads too much\\": thinkers.<br /><br />2. Our culture rightly admires risk-takers, but we need our \\"heed-takers\\" more than ever.<br /><br />3. Solitude is a catalyst for innovation.<br /><br />4. Texting is popular because in an overly extroverted society, everyone craves asynchronyous, non-F2F communication.<br /><br />5. We teach kids in group classrooms not because this is the best way to learn but because it's cost-efficient, and what else would we do with the children while all the grown-ups are at work? If your child prefers to work autonomously and socialize one-on-one, there's nothing wrong with her; she just happens not to fit the model.<br /><br />6. The next generation of quiet kids can and should be raised to know their own strength.<br /><br />7. Sometimes it helps to be a pretend-extrovert. There's always time to be quiet later.<br /><br />8. But in the long run, staying true to your temperament is the key to finding work you love and work that matters.<br /><br />9. Everyone shines, given the right lighting. For some, it's a Broadway spotlight, for others, a lamplit desk.<br /><br />10. Rule of thumb for networking events: one genuine new relationship is worth a fistful of business cards.<br /><br />11. It's OK to cross the street to avoid making small talk.<br /><br />12. \\"Quiet leadership\\" is not an oxymoron.<br /><br />13. The universal longing for heaven is not about immortality so much as the wish for a world in which everyone is always kind.<br /><br />14. If the task of the first half of life is to put yourself out there, the task of the second half is to make sense of where you've been.<br /><br />15. Love is essential, gregariousness is optional.<br /><br />16.\\"In a gentle way, you can shake the world.\\" - Gandhi<br /><br />The last thing I would like to convey is that I am happy I read this book, because being an introvert all of one's life can be difficult in modern U.S. culture.  Being treated as a freak because of the personality characteristics introversion entails is unfortunate.  Extroverts have it good right now, and frequently get the best rewards, even when an introvert is the one that deserves those rewards, value being placed on personality rather than merit, but it helps introverts to know we have superior characteristics, and should not regret them.
0439023491|5.0|I was wondering if I should continue w/ the second book of this trilogy, (\\"Catching Fire\\") and I'm now half way through it and I'm glad I decided to; it continues to hold my attention. Someone told me it's the best of the three, but that I HAVE to read the third as well to see what happens... Seems you have to read them all, because this second one seems better than the first to me, but the first is a must to understand it all. The first movie gets released in March of 2012, and the second Nov. 2013. I'm thinking that the way the world is going today, it may just relate to these stories and see the similarities and downfalls.
B003GFIWGK|5.0|Previous reviews have pointed out some deficiencies in the Kindle edition of this book. The last collection, The Case Book of SH, was missing and the table contents was hard to find or missing.  I bought the Kindle edition on October 8, 2011 and these issues have been resolved.  All 4 novels and 56 short stories are present -- I checked against the definitive Doubleday hardbound edition.  The table on contents works and can be found with the usual internal Kindle link. I tested it on a Kindle, and the Windows and Android apps.  This is the version Holmes fans have been waiting for. Get it.
0385344325|3.0|Months after having read Stieg Larsson's saga I was in dire need for a good fix of another well written thriller.  I've since bought seven books that I've thrown out the window one by one in disappointment until I read this.  In terms of suspense and cohesiveness I'd rate this book four stars.  I liked Lee Child's style of writing: terse, direct, local.  But in the end it's clear the book's just another pulp fiction.  What you have is an invincible hunk, an MP by profession, who is the investigator, enforcer, judge and executioner.  This is precisely what's wrong with our common perspective today, where we are conditioned by the simpleton notion that our self-righteousness gives license to violate others with impunity.  Moral depth is clearly not Child's long suit.
B004ZNAGNE|5.0|Some albums have been around for so long that they've seeped into the public conscious and been so influential that they can seem to lose some of their impact. That still doesn't detract from the quality of the music. \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is one of those albums.<br /><br />The album that truly was a breakthrough for the band this new edition will be essential for fans even those that prefer their Black Triangle, Mofi and 5.1 editions of the album because of the second disc--a vintage live performance of the entire album. Unlike some of the other releases (\\"The Wall\\" springs to mind)EMI and the band have elected to make one of the concerts from the [[ASIN:B004ZNARH4 The Dark Side Of The Moon - Immersion Box Set]] boxed set available as a two disc edition with the vintage concert on CD.<br /><br />The remaster for the first disc sounds pretty good--if you have a favorite release I would suggest doing a complete comparison because, depending on how you listen to the album, you MAY notice some differences (in favor of one or the other).<br /><br />What matters is the second disc for most fans in this case and this is a terrific vintage concert that is well worth picking up. Keep in mind that this is a vintage live performance so there are some limitations that apply to this especially when compared to newer concert recordings. It's nice to hear the original line up do the entire album live (I would have also included some of the tracks from other albums that were performed from the same concert as well)around the time of the original release.<br /><br />This isn't as exhaustive as the \\"Immersion\\" boxed set (and quite frankly it would have been nice to have a high resolution version of this album made available again in this edition but that's minor quibbling)but it's a nice compromise and given our current economy I'd like to recognition that at least the band made this deluxe edition available as a separate stand-alone release from the single disc remaster and the \\"Immersion\\" boxed set.
B001TWT0AE|5.0|This is easily the best John Wayne film ever and I've seen every one of them.  Wonderful cast: Duke, Jimmy Stewart, Lee Marvin, Vera Miles, Woody Strode, Andy Devine. This is not your typical western. I've seen it at least 10 times and it never gets old - everyone should see this movie. John Ford's masterpiece.
B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|A young woman has written a book about her brave parents who captured and killed a Nazi war criminal. The details of the tale could have only come from her parents, which contradicts reality. The movie reminded me of my dad who told us kids WWII stories. Dad was stationed on a converted aircraft carrier which cruised off the coast of North Carolina. He never saw any action...but we heard stories about how his vessel (USS Solomon) captured a U-boat and how he worked on Ted Williams' airplane. There was a U-boat captured, but not by his ship and he did work on planes similar to that of Ted Williams. My sister believed every word and wrote a paper on WWII for her class based on my dad's inaccuracies. The teacher was a WWII buff and we then discovered dad was a BS artist. Imagine writing a book based on stories your parents tell you and selling it to the world!<br /><br />Helen Mirren is a great actress and basically if she is in it, I am willing to watch it. The story of the killing, as related in the book is fairly simple. The Nazi was captured and tied up. He got loose, attacked Rachel Singer (Helen), gave her a facial scar and fled. As she was laying there in her own blood, she manages to pull out a small hand gun and shoot the fleeing Nazi in the back, from a considerable distance in my opinion, and kill him. But is that how it happened? That is what the movie is about. Jessica Chastain plays the young Rachel Singer as she teams up in Berlin with Sam Worthington and Marton Csokas to bring the evil Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen) to justice. As it turns out Dieter is now a gynecologist, so guess which of the three spies stages visits with him?<br /><br />The film moves slow in many scenes. Helen Mirren is her classy self. I thought Jessica Chastain did an excellent job in her role which got better as the movie progressed. Marton Csokas has a good scene toward the end of the film and Sam Worthington should stick to Avatar. You want to watch the film to see how things play out...which is to say I liked how things progressed but I wasn't overly pleased with the ending. 4 1/2 stars<br /><br />F-bomb, no nudity.is to say I liked how things progressed but I wasn't overly pleased with the ending. 4 1/2 stars  F-bomb, no nudity.
B005I547ZG|3.0|Whilst reasonably well told there simply isn't the time necessary to develop a decent plot or set of characters in these 3 very short stories. Also a quarter of the book is given up to an excerpt from the next full novel in the series, which although compelling can usually be downloaded for free as a taster from Amazon anyway so I didn't see the point. I know that short stories by their very nature only tend to touch on issues and leave much to the reader's imagination, but none of the stories brought light to new topics, nor did they offer a different approach to existing ones or give us any new insight to Harry's character.   I am a great fan of Michael Connelly and the Harry Bosch character, but hope that the author sticks to full length novels in the future. After reading the opening chapters I'm looking forward to reading THE DROP and hope that it helps both me and other loyal readers get over SUICIDE RUN.

B001JEB7S0|3.0|I purchased this book for class.  The teacher had given specific instructions for which edition to buy, although he himself was uncertain of all of the publishing details.  One of them was page count.  He had mentioned 362 pages.  Amazon listed this edition as 362 pages, which was a deciding point.  This was a more expensive edition to purchase, but I did it anyways.  Unfortunately, the edition is actually 316 pages.  This was not useful for my class when the professor wanted us to go to a particular page, which was often.  The plot of the book itself is decent: the trials (literally) and travails of intercultural exchange in colonial India circa early 1900s makes for a decent read for a schoolbook.  The dialogue was generally good, and the descriptive text evocative.  At times, though, I wanted to throw my book against the wall.  Some of the characters seemed pure caricature, annoyingly so, and I did not care for how Hindus were viewed at an authorial level.  Also, sometimes Forster seemed to be too in love with his own descriptions to scale them back from multiple rage rambles.  The book is OK, but I will not read it again unless required to by a class.
B005BQTUVI|4.0|A terrific if flawed fantasy/horror film, \\"Mimic\\" suffered from studio interference as the film was taken away from Guillermo Del Toro prior to release and recut. In the wake of his success with \\"Pan's Labrynith\\", Del Toro was given the opportunity to recut the film, alter the pacing and tone of the film to reflect as much of his original vision as possible and that included reinstating some scenes cut prior to release.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the meddling began well before the film went before cameras and the pre-production screenplay truly represents the \\"Director's Cut\\" of the film but, sadly, that film was never shot. As it stands though \\"Mimic\\" is still a terrific fantasy/horror/thriller even if it isn't what he had originally hoped for.<br /><br />Shot for less than $8 million the film did decent business at the box office (well enough to inspire two sequels that Del Toro wasn't involved in)making $25 million. This new Blu-ray release sparkles with a sharp, nice looking transfer. The film has always looked dark and the Blu-ray gives this film the visual depth that it has always needed and this is a much needed upgrade from the rather murky looking DVD released in 1998.<br /><br />The presentation isn't perfect however but it still looks exceptionally good particularly compared to what has come before and kudos must be given to Lion's Gate for allowing Del Toro the opportunity to return to this film and improve it. The film has always looked quite grainy and the Blu-ray remains true to the \\"look\\" of Del Toro's conception.<br /><br />Special features include an introduction from Del Toro and a commentary track where the director discusses the challenges he faced making the film from pre to post-production. We also get a fine featuette on the creature design and \\"Reclaiming Mimic\\" covers some of the same ground as the commentary track. \\"Back into the Tunnels\\" demonstrates what a shoddy DVD we got in the beginning as it provides us with lots of behind-the-scenes footage about the production of the film (the original DVD was virtually bare bones). Finally we get a gag reel, deleted scenes, animatics and the threatrical trailer (outside of a \\"digitial\\" copy  of the film).<br /><br />Although compromised (to some degree from the very beginning), \\"Mimic\\" has a marvelous idea and the re-editing does a nice copy of capturing the creepy mood that Del Toro was going for as well as restoring some of his original intent in making the movie. We'll never truly get a \\"Director's Cut\\" of the film because, quite frankly, there was a lot of stuff that was never shot for the film. Still, what Del Toro has done here has improved the film and the extras go a long way to explaining what went wrong (Miramax and the Weinsteins)during the shooting.<br /><br />The bottom line: While much remains the same about \\"Mimic\\" there's enough change to the structure of the over all film that improves it. Lion's Gate does a great job with the transfer considering the source and the extras are top notch. My only complaint is that for comparison purposes we should have gotten both cuts on Blu-ray.footage about the production of the film (the original DVD was virtually bare bones).

B005G4TJI4|1.0|if you are like me and like to go through specials features and \\"making of\\" documentary, this is not the BD to buy.  This is the second time I make the same mistake.  The first time I bough Avatar BD when it came out, and it only had the movie nothing else.  It is a waste of BD room space to make such releases without having a single special feature.  Wait for the Special Edition, full feature, BD release!  The movie was fun, but this BD should have been price at $10.00 USD which is the price one pays these day to see just a movie.  I will have to wait for the Special Edition, and give my copy to my young daughter who lives with her mom.  As I said, the movie is fun, but not the price of this BD, and this will be the last time I make this mistake.  I need to be more patient and not fill these mogul movie makers' pocket with our HARD earned MONEY.  What do you think?  Any opinions?

081297381X|5.0|A turkey spends each day eating well for a year, being cared for by a farmer whose actions seem to have the turkey's best interest at heart.  Each passing day further solidifies the turkey's belief danger is nonexistent and the farmer is his friend.  Then one unexpected day perhaps in late November - CHOP - the farmer cuts off his head.  \\"What can a turkey learn about what is in store for it tomorrow from the events of yesterday?\\" Taleb asks.  \\"A lot, perhaps but certainly a little less than it thinks, and it is just that 'little less' that may make all the difference.\\" Thus is the essence of the Black Swan, the dangers of the highly improbable and how a dependence on patterns of the past leave one susceptible to danger.<br /><br />Taleb rails against the notion that bell curves satisfy the sampling of all facts and that modeling the past, even if it were possible to do perfectly, cannot possibly predict unexpected events.  Natural disasaters, terrorist attacks, bank crisis; these things tend to not show up on normal prediction models finding themselves typically lumped into either being too unlikely or just impossible to predict - yet they all have major impacts when they do happen.  Taleb thus asserts that if our prediction models cannot or do not account for the highly improbable yet these events typically have significant impacts, what use are the models?<br /><br />His answer for this is robustness and redundancy.  Riding out the storm (surviving) is just as important to long term success as growth, but predominantly overlooked.  Listen to Taleb's comment regarding how misunderstood his message had been during the financial meltdown of 2008.  \\"Matthew Barett, former Chairman of Barclays Bank and Bank of Montreal complained, after all the events of 2008 and 2009, that the Black Swan did not tell him 'what I should do about that' and he 'can't run a business' worrying about Black Swan risks.  The person has never heard of the notion of fragility and robustness to extreme deviations - which illustrates my idea.\\"  Had this banker run his organization with a little more thought on how they might have endured unexpected news things could have been different.  Yet as evidenced by the similar line of thinking among most financial institutions at the time, its all too common to go on operating and planning as if the patterns of the past can be counted on to predict the future with little regard to how they would handle matters if that wasn't true.<br /><br />Taleb is heavily biased by his history as a trader and takes aim chiefly at economics.  But the idea of the Black Swan (that no amount of white swans can prove black swans do not exist) is evident everywhere.  Nearly any area that entails assumptions about the future is affected by the notion of the black swan.  His writing is choppy, often staggering from one point to another, and as much of this book is anecdotal as it is scientific.  Yet having seen him speak I came to the realization that this has more to do with his lack of command of the English language (he is Lebanese whose first language is French) and his greater interest in philosophizing than in debating.  Neither detracts from the validly of his message and anyone who enjoys giving thought to the meaning of the events that shape our lives will find insight and value from this book.- which illustrates my idea.\\"  Had this banker run his organization with a little more thought on how they might have endured unexpected news things could have been different.

B001P3OMY6|5.0|As much as I loved this story itself, I can't imagine it being as entertaining to read as it was having it read to me by such a brilliant narrator!  She captured the characters so well, every accent (even that of a woman with a strong southern accent trying to imitate a British accent, hilarious!), every intonation and emotion.  I was up until 4 in the morning, laying next to my husband in bed listening to this book and trying very hard not to laugh out loud and wake him!  Some have complained about it not being clean enough for a Shannon Hale novel, and I am somewhat of a prude when it comes to that sort of thing as well, but I never felt offended or uncomfortable during this story.  Yes, there is more mention of grown-up things than the Bayern books and the rest, which explains why those are all categorized as Young Adult and this one was not.  But compared to most adult fiction books, this one really has nothing to be ashamed of whatsoever.    The whole concept just made me chuckle before even reading the book itself, and is a must read for any Austen fan. I do, however, agree that the ending would've been better if it had involved more getting-to-know-you, sensible conversation on the flight home, in keeping with Jane's desire to become a new and improved person where her love-life was concerned.  It could've ended with more of an Austen feel that way.  But by that point, I was so enthralled and delighted by the overall story that I was very willing to overlook that point.    Great story, fabulously narrated on the audio version, and a must read/listen for any Austen fan!
0316010669|3.0|Things may not be immediately discernible in what a man writes, and in this sometimes he is fortunate; but eventually they are quite clear and by these and the degree of alchemy that he possesses he will endure or be forgotten. - Hemingway, 1954  Going with the tenet of thin-slicing, having read the first few pages, I should have liked the book cover-to-cover and lapped it up in a Sunday session of early morning's magic hours. Instead, the curiosity to discover something new unraveled over a few sessions and only the desire to finish the book had me complete it. The tagline states 'The power of thinking without thinking\\", and that has a different connotation than I had imagined initially. It is not innate, it is honed over years of doing the same thing and achieving expertise in the subject, that allows someone to be on \\"autopilot\\".

0470503696|2.0|This book is good for individual concepts, but it does not connect the dots. After going through the entire book, I have to say that I don't feel that I could write a useful program. The examples given are too simple, and subsequent sections in the book do not show how to build on knowledge gained in the previous sections. Unless you are extremely smart, you won't by the end of this book, be able to write a program with the complexity of say, for example, something that gives the roots of a quadratic equation including complex roots, or be able to make the solver addin function do multiple calculations for you.   In short, this book is a good reference if you need to know something specific, but it wont make you a programer, as it claims it will. Something that would definetely make it more helpful would be if the author could include some excercises and worked examples of progressively greater complexity.

B001GKYBXA|4.0|McCartney has been a constant music soundtrack in my life on this Earth. I am better off for it. The Beatles, Paul's solo act, Wings, and the Fireman have delivered a little mediocore and a lot of greatness in music. It has taken me a little over a year to come full circle with his Fireman's release \\"Electric Arguements\\".<br />( Note: He is getting married again real soon if not by the time you read this.) It is sad to say that no woman on this planet will make him happier than his first real love and wife Linda. His music is kind of like that for his fans. The best stuff came from his first love and group, The Beatles. A nice fill-in, Wings, satisfied some that knew the first relationship would never reform again. His efforts with the Threatles thrilled us all with two songs made for The Anthology. Not quite the same as the original. We all want that first love again. We got along with a second one because we knew the dream was over in 1980. As the Fireman, Paul's fans feel he can flirt with real love and at the same time feel like he is settling. His latest date is always compared to his first love, and that's  not fair. Especially when he tries to show his true feelings. Fans compare \\"his girlfriends\\" to others' first loves. That's not fair either. On this release, he isn't trying to be bluesy like Zep or trippy like Floyd. His musical arrangements are close to Bach's and Beethoven's quick arrangements in their \\"experimental\\" works as his with Youth. The Fireman's songs were whimsical but very listenable to his fans. It may have taken 15 minutes to write one of these diddys, but other artist couldn't hold Paul's jock strap in melody arrangements. His foundation of musical talent allows him to invent a melody in his sleep.  That is a true story.) \\"Electric Arguements\\" might be more like a lot of first dates. In each one, Paul puts his best foot forward to get the date to like him. He isn't giving all his heart because each date (song) isn't where he's really at during this period. The 13 arrangements here hold you over until the real thing shows up. Truth is, the first love has already come and gone, and if you can't settle for a few decent first dates, you'll never be satisfied.

B005974CDU|4.0|I have been listening to DT ever since When Dream and Day Unite.  On all their records, they have their moments of \\"ok, that was a good song\\" to \\"WHOA! Lemme hear that one again\\".  To be fair and honest, this record is not their best.  I like Train of Thought better, and that is considered one of thier least favorites among fans.  The main problem I have with DToE is the overlong and unnecessary instrumental sections within the songs.  I understand that that is what makes up prog rock and normally it fits.  It doesn't here.  I find that they have done with music what Stephen King does with words......uses too many unnecessarily.  I am a major fan of both DT and SK, so I know what I'm talking about).  With both, if they would cut their work down by even a third, they would be great.  Likewise, this record would have blown me away if the tracks aimed for the 6 to 6 1/2 minute mark.  Long songs worked excellently for them in the past.  This record simply contains too many solos.  It's like they are giving everyone their fair share of soloing time.  You get solos from every member of the band here and it's a bit much to take.  Otherwise, it is another 4 star release from Dream Theater.  Tracks 4, 7, and 9 alone are worth the price of admission here.  If you are reading this and are new to DT, their best records to date are Images and Words and Awake.  If you want to get into DT, get those records first.  Everything else will follow.  Recommended.
0691152640|5.0|1. This book has quickly become one of the standard references for discussions regarding the causes, progression and long-term effects of financial crises.<br /><br />2. In the sense that the authors' discussions and conclusions are well researched, this book is scholarly.  It is not light reading, although the intelligent lay reader will do fine.<br /><br />3. The authors have a sense of humor, which makes reading this book a little easier.  Their humor starts with the title of the book, which is not to be taken literally.<br /><br />4. With the various forms of financial crisis present in many parts of the world, the book is clearly topical.<br /><br />5. The main part of the book, which is only about 290 pages, can be read and understood in a reasonable amount of time.<br /><br />6. The book's charts and tables distill a lot of information into relatively short spaces.  The charts and tables are imbedded into the main text and into detailed, separate data appendixes.<br /><br />7. The book does not promote simplistic, one size fits all, solutions.  The economic world, after all, is complicated.<br /><br />8. The roots of the present lie deep in the past.  An understanding of the common problems and policy mistakes of earlier financial crises can help citizens and policymakers make better policy choices.<br /><br />9. The book is blessedly non-partisan.<br /><br />10. It is too early to tell for sure, but I suspect that this book, alongside works that have stood the test of time, will become a classic in the field of financial crises.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|I posted this review at IMDb already, but wanted to share my thoughts here as well.I'm a person that will stay away from a really hyped movie until after the noise dies down. Seeing movies over-hyped tends to cloud my opinion.  I finally caught this today, and I really don't see what the fuss was. As full disclosure, I didn't see any of the other movies in the Best Actress category, so I cannot say who deserved to win, but I was incredibly underwhelmed by NP's performance. Natalie's expressions were Stressed and More Stressed. Oh, and add a look of paranoia. Not a lot of range in this. My opinion of course, but with all the accolades, I was expecting to be blown away. I felt like I was watching NP play an obsessed (and mentally-ill) ballerina. In my opinion, Portman came off as very aware of this being an Oscar-bait role, and thus the performance never seemed natural or organic. As a note to that: MAJOR props to the special effects team. I thoroughly enjoyed Nina's visual transformation near the climax from the White Swan features to the Black Swan. I did shudder during that scene.   As for the story, I expected more. It was dark, but based on reviews, I expected something much more disturbing and maybe more unusual? I did turn away from certain parts, such as the breaking legs and the bloody feet scenes as things like that make me queasy. Based on my one viewing, it seemed to be a study on mental illness. Shades of Fight Club and Memento(both are superior), but without soul and genuine intrigue. I don't mind a movie left to the viewer's interpretation, but this movie made sure everything was up in the air. This movie asked us to make a lot of assumptions. We never saw Beth (Winona Ryder) dance. So it's unclear why (aside from being the prima) Nina idolizes her. We never see the other ladies audition, so Nina winning the part could really be a result of the director's creepy fixation on her than of talent. We don't see what makes Thomas' \\"visceral\\" Swan Lake so unique, in terms of how much of the actual performance we see. All we're watching is Nina's descent into further madness, which is fine, but I expected the climax to consume more of the run-time. No, I don't need anything spelled out, but the way the movie left things felt so obnoxious and lazy. On the other hand, could all the light/dark/black/white have been more obvious? I've never seen Swan Lake, but based on what I've read, this was a perverted interpretation. The gratuitous sex scenes were cheap (Monster's Ball cheap) and did not move the plot. Even Portman commented on how the scene w/Kunis was how you get people in the theater. The old train pervert served no purpose as well. I was hoping the movie would show appreciation for ballet, but it didn't, and I'm not a dancer. 127 Hours showed both the wonders and the dangers of nature, for example. The dream sequence in Oklahoma was a better tribute to ballet. Then again, two characters did talk us through the storyline of Swan Lake, so I guess that should have been a clue that we wouldn't \\"see\\" it.  Another thing that bothered me was we're to believe that Nina is obsessed about being the Swan, but she doesn't seem obsessive about anything else. Not asking for much, but something as simple as having to brush her hair w/100 strokes every night or some OCD-type habit. Don't think the vomiting applies b/c I think that was stress- related. I guess self-mutilation would work, as stated earlier, anything with blood or if I felt blood/peeling skin/etc coming, I looked away. Plus, this was not done in the open, so I feel they could have added something that other characters saw. The couple of \\"mean girl\\" ballerinas in the beginning of the film seemed like perfect candidates to hone in on some quirk of Nina's that would point to her problem. How is it that her obsessiveness is so contained? If gratuitous sex could be added, then surely, Aronofsky could have developed Nina more.   Mila Kunis' character wasn't as fleshed out asI expected which leads me to believe Nina imagined her. I believe the movie was about Nina's disturbed psyche likely brought on by her repressed childhood/adulthood and it culminated into her killing herself. She had a mom that was trying to live through her, and she had the internal struggle of not being good enough in a highly competitive profession.   As a superficial observation, Natalie Portman is only 30, but looked a lot older. I get the reasons for her weight loss, but visually, it did her no favors and she came across quite harsh onscreen.  NOT attacking Portman, but she looked no younger than Winona which made it somewhat unbelievable that Nina's supposedly this great dancer, but has yet to have a leading role at her age. I can't remember if they said how old she was, but anything other than 29/30 is not believable. Certainly not at a peak age which I hear is early 20s.   The ending was a letdown and possessed a cheese factor. When Nina said  \\"I felt it...It was perfect...That was perfect.\\" (complete with a smile), my ears actually heard \\" All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.\\" So cheesy. Probably won't watch again as it didn't live up to the hype. Mulholland Drive might have been a better movie. In fact, Summer Glau as a tortured ballerina dancing 'Giselle' ('Waiting in the Wings' episode of Angel) exhibited more emotion, intrigue, and coherency.
B004DK5CW4|1.0|I ordered this tape in February.  Summer is a bad time for me to watch DVD's.  Finally open and tried to watch Secretariat.  The sound was so low I couldn't  make out the words.  Tried to adjust it and was unable to.  Checked DVD player  and all OK.  You can only return it within 30 days so I'm stuck with a worthless DVD.  I should have checked the return for exchange policy before  I ordered this, or checked it when I received it.  Will know better in the future.
B003LD9P4K|1.0|I have been an ELP fan since the beginning. I have seen them countless times in concert over the past 40 years. I was disappointed in this DVD. Keith Emerson's performance was rushed and sloppy. He did not have his full battery of keyboards, and bashing his Hammond organ in the encore was too corny. Greg Lake's voice was not what it used to be. Aside from playing acoustic guitar on \\"From the Beginning\\" and \\"Lucky Man\\" he only played bass. Carl Palmer's performance was excellent, however his drum kit was a bit down-sized as well. The biggest disappointment for me was they did not include \\"Pirates\\" in this performance. The 40th anniversary DVD from 2010 is about the same as this one, however Lake's voice is a bit stronger in spite of the 40-50 lbs he gained since 1997. And Mr. Palmer is sporting a belly too, and also no \\"Pirates\\". If you absolutely have to have an ELP performance DVD, I would recommend the 40th anniversary DVD over the Montreaux '97.

I'm sure as she grows it will be a favorite of hers too.
1400052181|5.0|This is truly a book you can't put down until you've finished it. It's a true story, told with compassion and thoughtfulness by an author who also reveals how she compiled the story from numerous (often reluctant) sources.
1577311523|5.0|I was thinking why do we exist, I came up with this. Pikaia survived the Burgess decimation.   This response does not cite a single law of nature; it embodies no statement about predictable   evolutionary pathways, no calculation of probabilities based on general rules of anatomy or   ecology. The survival of Pikaia was a contingency of just history. I do not think that any   higher answer can be given, and I cannot imagine that any resolution could be more fascinating.   We are the offspring of history, and must establish our own paths in this most diverse and   interesting of conceivable universes-one indifferent to our suffering, and therefore offering   us maximum freedom to thrive, or to fail, in our own chosen way.  My contention to your preposterous rhetoric regarding our very existence in which we thrive   as a single minute unit which are completely devouring and deteriorating the very core to   what enabled us to evolve into the intellectual beings we are today, is that evolution itself   is a physically forced change that occurs as our environments dramatically revolutionize into   completely different atmospheric living conditions further in time altering our internal   genetic codes to either acclimate to these conditions or become extinct. Furthermore, I   believe that we are the offspring of evolution brought here by matter in space from other   planets molecules containing living extraterrestrial enzymes that lived within the meteors,   dust and debris through the actual violent fruition that joined for the creation of this   very planet in which we now live.     Even those who have observed the sawtooth pattern of fluctuation between emergence and   destruction, further emergence and still further destruction, and who have already charted   the eventual end of the universe, are half agreed that there is a stubborn tendency toward   an upward progression. This is no great surprise: inefficient creatures will either die out   or be destroyed by more successful ones. But progress does not negate the idea of randomness,   and when he came to examine the Burgess shale, the great paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould   arrived at the most disquieting and unsettling conclusion of all. He examined the fossils   and their development with minute care and realized that if this tree could be replanted or   this soup set boiling again it would very probably not reproduce the same results that we now know.  These spoken observations were inexorably observed by individual scientific voyagers who   thrived on premeditated assumptions which may have lead to misrepresented results based   solely in favor of their particular hypothesis on the subject matter. It is inevitable   that the consumption of natural resources being removed from the planets core will unavoidably   create further unstable conditions and extreme changes to the stability of the survivability   for not only life itself, but the life of the planet. In the momentum we have been accelerating   in with this internal destruction, we can be certain that it will surely lead to mankind's   demise and possibly paving the way for a new planetary evolution as with the dinosaurs.     Probably the most daunting task we face, as partly rational animals with adrenal glands that   are far too big and prefrontal lobes that are far too small, is the contemplation of our own   relative weight in the scheme of things. Our place in the cosmos is so unimaginably small   that we cannot, with our miserly endowment of cranial matter, contemplate it for long at all.   No less difficult is the realization that we may also be quite random as presence on earth.  I do concur with the inability for the traditional homosapian's mental capacity's comprehension   incapable of understanding the possible unimaginable minuteness in the cosmos and as mentioned   prior, share a random presence similar to that of which the disambiguational creatures that   once roamed on the very soil we walk known asthe dinosaurs, which alike, we will face our   demise in a different way and most likely by our own arrogance and planetary abuse.     In the occasion that one may discover themselves in a situation that they are unaware of,   no immediate action would be essential at that instance due to the deficiency of comprehension   of the circumstances at hand. However, some may dispute that a minute quantity of individuals   have the aptitude to exhibit unwavering intellectual capacity beyond imaginable human understanding,   and can unmistakably anticipate the repercussions of inadvertent judgments that had not been   commenced  hitherto.   Psychological rejection of familiarity to any focus of substance is unswervingly correlated   an individual's personal interests as well as their prior education. The excessive information   in auxiliary causes an obstruction in the intellectual cerebral psychosis of the brain that is   conscientious for generating and hoarding newer as well as older information and memories.   In the occurrence that nothing is currently initiating, you are compellingly mandated into a   rational immobile condition impenetrable to rationale or substantial dexterity and once again   recognize that you are in that state of affairs you originally were oblivious to.      After much analysis, I have concluded that instantaneously decompressing ones self proclaimed   reputability essentially reduces fabricated triumph used to falsely impress individuals who   delineate a superior standing demeanor which inevitably sabotages the firm seize submissive   to contrary inferences reinforced by a non-judiciary protocol under direct oversight from the   lead commanding official appointed and entrusted to authorize anything not authorized by a multitude   of unauthorized authorities that are also authorized to authorize only on minute levels of authorized   command authority.       Thus be it said, on opposition to enjoined impingement, classifications will be assigned to any and   all unbiased bipartisan concessions persuasive towards regulatory rectifications voted in by at least   a minimum of half a unanimous majority in accordance with security requirements necessary for an   impeccable enigmatic fortification to be established which will ineluctably offer unwavering   preventative inhabiting, equivalent to that of which is offered by the nonexistent National   Authority Commission which neither grants or denies ownership, either individually or jointly,   under unfailing systematic renderings of schematical designs corresponding to an intellectional   super highway.     This plethora of investments vastly increases supportive momentum by critics sworn to oppose   international homeland relocation and climate control measures that allow for the temporary   barter of tropical land masses for arctic alliances diminishing the incoherence of 3rd world   tribal leaders, presidents, and dictators alike, recognized for this very enactment on large   scale proposals for aggressive tolerances set forth in conjunction with micro-fiberoptic transmissions   of electromagnetic decibels heard only through sophisticated technology devised by experts   in communications through advancements in circuitry conductors.     Furthermore, these devices maintain capabilities of manifesting intelligence independently   among channels of frequencies intercepted from foreign ariel satellites roving in orbit and   relaying intelligence on sensitive extraterrestrial data constantly being accidentally   released by unknown sources in encrypted code and deciphered in a cultivated translation software   which imposes verbal sanctions across a widespread plane of mystic fields and meadows textured in   colorful diminutive beings disporting about in cordially coordinated displacements and interacting   on a social level of contentment and unpredictability.

An amazing voice, nice variety of up and fun and ballads.  Even the messages of falling in love, that special someone catching your eye manages to take me back in time and fall in love with my hubby all over again.

0393338398|4.0|Excellent book as always from Michael Lewis who led us through Wall Street in Liar's Poker.  Now he turns his attention to baseball, specifically how a small market, low budget team in Oakland can remain competitive. I wanted to read this now that the movie was out. Billy Bean must be very happy that Brad Pitt was selected to play him.   Long time baseball fans like myself know Bean as a highly touted player who never did much in the major leagues despite his prolific talent.  From the perspective of why talented players fail and why less talented players like Lenny Dykstra succeed (in baseball, not counting his failed businesses and relationships), Bean sets out to build a winning team from a bunch of spare parts nobody else wants. He puts more faith in Excel spreadsheets than conventional baseball wisdom. In retrospect now (this book was written 8 years ago), we can see that some of the players Bean wanted in the draft worked out well (Nick Swisher became a star with the Yankees) and others did not (Jeremy \\"Badger\\" Brown only had a cup of coffee in the show).  Bean was probably most successful in getting some return when he needed to dump his stars to cut salary. Most of the players on the Oakland A's roster (Tejada, Bradford, Hernandez, Giambi, Swisher) ended up going to anothe team, usually the mis-guided Baltimore Orioles, in exchange for money, prospects, or at least first round draft picks.   Bean was his own worst enemy.  He is still the Oakland A's GM today, most of his assistants have moved on to other GM jobs. Any edge that Bean had in evaluating talent and exploiting the market 10 years ago seems to have disappeared. Apparently his rough edges and extreme temper and mood swings have moderated with age. But to the bottom line. The Oakland Athletics have not won the World Series since 1989, long before the Bean system was in place. In fact that team was the antithesis of the Bean system, it featured a huge payroll, baseball's most conventional manager (Tony LaRussa) and one dimensional players like Mark Mcguire and Jose Canseco.  I think Bean fails to grasp the genius of Earl Weaver, who is remembered today for pitching, defense, and the three run homer (essentially the Moneyball approach implemented before Bean could hold a bat), but also Earl know to use the assets of players on his roster.  Hence Earl would play smallball when Dempsey, Wiggins, or Bumbry was at bat but not with Eddie Murray or Frank Robinson.
0385510438|3.0|This was one of the weaker Grisham books. It literally took me four months to finish, picking it up here and there again, reading a couple of chapters, then going on to do something else. The reason I finished it is because it was a good look into Southern culture during the desegregation era. I liked much of the social commentary, particularly that on corruption, the legal system, and segregation. But it is not suspenseful, and nothing like books such as A Time to Kill, which is what got me started on Grisham (even though both books take place in the same setting). Also, the ending was very disappointing - with a relatively minor character gaining the spotlight suddenly in the last forty or so pages. The killing of jurors sparked my interest, but I was expecting some sort of twisted ending - like Callie Ruffin being the mastermind of everything or something along those lines. Also, I find the writing style in this book somewhat lacking. In earlier Grisham books it was as though you could see exactly what he was describing. Here you have to labour through paragraphs and re-read them because it is unclear what kind of picture he is painting. The first-person writing style, I find, exacerbates this problem (although it worked somewhat in \\"The Rainmaker\\".)

B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Chris and Emily have been dating through high school and together they form a suicide pact.  However, Chris is still alive and crimal charges are brought upon him.  Picoult again explores issues of contemporary society.  Some reviewers wish there were more emphasis and research on the psychology of her characters and others wish the empasis was more on the legal aspects.  But somehow Picoult is able to appeal and satisfy most readers.  I am not going to complain about any of it because I admit that I just like the damn stories and I am not going to apologize for it. I also not going to analize it to death.  I wouldn't analyze a Harelequin Romance when I know that for me it is a secret pleasure every now and then...no pun intended...and for those same reasons I can't do it to Picoults books either.  She has a magical money making mystery machine....good alliteration huh???...and I can't blame her for it.  She writes books for the masses and if you don't like one of them then I suggest you stop reading her books...because you can complain about the same things for each and every book.  So do yourself a favor and save the money or the time or the brain cells or whatever...they all deal with contemporary issues that usually involve some sort of psychological study with a dose of legel proceedings mixed in.<br /><br />Ok that being said...let me do my analysis that I said I wouldn't do!  I think in this book Emily's character is a little weak and could use more explaining.  Both Chris and Emily seem pretty mature for their age.  But all in all, I think her books are good reads.  I am always drawn into the story by something and this book is no different.  See not much analysis to do....I just like her books!  End of story.

But witches aren't always as appreciated as they should be, and Terry Pratchett's \\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\" flings the sensible young girl -- and the Nac Mac Feegles -- against a threat that really, really doesn't like witches.<br /><br />Tiffany is doing the usual witchy rounds in Chalk -- nursing the sick, burying the dead, watching cheese races, and rescuing the occasional girl from an abusive father. Then the local Duke expires after a long illness, and it's up to Tiffany to tell his son Roland and his \\"watercolour-painting wife-to-be\\" about what happened.<br /><br />The problem is, she's being stalked by a creepy eyeless man with a vile psychic stench, who is inspiring people to hate and distrust witches. Suddenly stones are being thrown, accusations are being made, and Tiffany even finds herself in the Ankh-Morpork jail. And if Tiffany doesn't find a way to stop the Cunning Man, things will get very toasty for the witches...<br /><br />Due to having Alzheimer's disease, Terry Pratchett had to dictate \\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\" instead of the usual computer typing.

B00005RDRO|3.0|Murder by Death is a hilarious film by playwright Neal Simon and frankly if you are not familiar with the mystery films of the 1940s - 1960s and are not much of a mystery reader, then the film will come across as nothing more than a fun film with a few silly jokes.<br /><br />All the characters from various films and books are gathered together in a single castle - similar to Agatha Christie's \\"And then there were None.\\" The characters are all parodies of these characters, cleverly done.<br /><br />Charlie Chan is now Sidney Wang (and his son Willie - the metaphors are obvious!), played by Peter Sellers, himself an actor who played the detective in The Pink Panther.<br /><br />Marbles is based on Christie's character Marples, played by Elsa Lancaster, herself in a TV murder mystery series.<br /><br />Peter Falk of Columbo fame is Sam Diamond, clearly the parody of Bogart's Sam Spade.<br /><br />Milo Perrier (what water?) is played by Jimmy Coco, a parody of Christie's Hercule Peroit.<br /><br />And Nick & Nora Charles complete with terrier (!) being Dick and Dora Charleston, played by Maggie Smith (Harry Potter films) and David Niven.<br /><br />What I liked best about the film was the interaction of all the players and how each of them parodied their respective characters.

B005ERX1Z0|2.0|This is another one of those movies where they put all these famous comedians and actors together for a race type film, and yet they want to call it a comedy, but this one really stunk at being a comedy.  I would say that \\"Cannonball Run II\\" was marginally better because it featured Ricardo Montelban as Jamie Farr's sheik father, who finances the second race.  Plus, it had Tony Danza, Frank Sinatra, Richard Kiel, Abe Vigoda, Charles Nelson Reilly, and a whole lot of other great stars to help the rather lame comedy.<br /><br />I don't know why Hollywood thinks that Burt Reynolds was a good investment for comedy and film.  He's rather ridiculous and even annoying as someone who thinks he's some kind of \\"lady's fantasy guy\\". I hope he realizes how much he embarrasses himself. But, this film had enough other annoyances that takes your mind off of Burt Reynolds. Two people that made this \\"Cannonball Run\\" a little more stupid than it had to be is the pansy acting of Dom Deluise, and the atrocious farce of Roger Moore thinking (and only thinking, and fantasizing about being) James Bond.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope that \\"Cannonball Run II\\" will eventually be released.  I had hoped that these two films would have been released together as a double feature of the same dull concept that they are, because only then will I think it would be worth maybe about six to ten bucks.<br /><br />I would rather see Burt Reynolds \\"Stroker Ace\\" released on Blu-Ray instead of this bore of a comedy.  So, let's see what happens for next year for more 80's releases on to Blu-Ray.

B004EPZ00W|4.0|Let me be clear: I think \\"Moneyball\\" is a very good movie. The screenplay by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin is very finely wrought, filled with scintillating dialogue and, at the end, all sorts of bittersweet irony. Bennett Miller translates the screenplay expertly to the screen, and the acting is exactly right for the story. But I was led by the advance reviews to expect a transcendent masterpiece, very probably the greatest sports movie ever made, and that is not what I found.<br /><br />The advance word on \\"Moneyball\\" was that it's the baseball movie for people who don't follow baseball. On the contrary, I believe it is a movie for people who are obsessed with baseball. With its relentless focus on baseball statistics, scouts, trading players, etc., \\"Moneyball\\" has an attraction mostly for fans fascinated by the mechanics of the game, though Miller, Zaillian and Sorkin do a good job of making the process interesting. There is surprisingly little action on the diamond, and much of it is filtered through the main characters watching the games on TV.<br /><br />The statement by Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) toward the middle of the movie--that he doesn't get too close to the players because that would make it hard to trade or fire them--seems toward the end like an excuse for the fact that Brad Pitt is pretty much the entire movie. Except for Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman--the latter with only about ten minutes of screen time--Pitt is the only actor who registers strongly (though the young actress who plays Pitt's daughter also makes a good impression). Pitt has never been more effortlessly charming, or so thoroughly at home in his own body; he will almost certainly be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for this, and he will probably win. But I can't help remembering that, several years ago, Kurt Russell gave an even better performance in \\"Miracle\\" as Olympic hockey coach Herb Brooks. It was a very similar role to Billy Beane, and Russell wasn't nominated for anything.

1573225517|5.0|At least 5 times I found myself nodding in recognition. We've all been there, or at least something similar. We might not all be 35 and record shop owners, of course. We aren't all capable of making top five lists of everything either.  The author puts words on what goes on in a guy's head, and he does it really well, with a lot of wit and honesty Woman who wants to understand how a man's thought processes works should read this book.

B002MZKQ32|5.0|If you enjoyed the \\"Kite Runner\\" you will surely enjoy A Thousand Splendid Suns. Although two totally different stories, both share the compassion and love between friendship and hardship. This book is about the history of the Afghan women.  Very touching;I loved the bonding between the women. This book educated me about the conditions under which Afghan women were exposed to. A must read!

B002BD4UGY|4.0|I'm happy the remastered edition of the Ratt records finally come to light. I am because I loved the band in the eighties and because the original editions sound very poor. They lacks depth, dynamic, contrast, air, quality sounds. In the end they sound flat. The first cd I got from this new batch of remastering is \\"Dancing Undercover\\", probably a weak album in the end from a  musical standpoint. I like it, I have to say, but it's not the best from the band, which is \\"Invasion of your privacy\\" to me. The album sounds quite the same from the beginning to the end, there are not many changes in the mood, this may be considered a strong point or a weak one. Personally I find it lacks some tension and drama ,... everything is too much predictable in the music. It's not a bad album, it has its strong moments, \\"Body talk\\", \\"Enough is enough\\" and \\"One good lover\\" are probably the best tunes and Warren plays great as he always did by the way. But you know, it's one of those albums that are not great, not bad, just good. But maybe it's not enough. Talking about the SHM Japan edition I have in my hands, I can say it's wonderful, as always are japanese editions. Everything is like the old vynil edition, with the inside cover perfectly replicated. It's wonderful to have everything back, japaneses know very well what the collectors want. In terms of audio reproduction I have a very good hi end system and you audiophiles like me know very well that rock cds very seldom play great and do justice to the quality of your system. I can say that this edition sounds well enough, but it's not the best sounding rock album I own (which is probably SHM edition of Yes 90125). The comparison with the original edition is impossible, we have a good sounding album here, the old one was quite poor. The original edition lacks dynamic more than anything else, the sounds are too much sleak and flat. With the SHM edition they overcome this weakness a little bit but the general sound of the album is the same. Yes there are a lot more volume, dynamic and contrast, and it's a nice audio experience. But it's not GREAT, probably the limits of the original recordings are too much. Anyway, if you are a fan of the band you probably want to own this one. I think it's an important upgrading to the original version of the album, ... even if the limits of the recording are somewhat still here.same.

B0052GVGYG|5.0|This is a great album. Truely magic. Everything came together just right. The songs are deep and soulful. Wrtten well and performed superbly by the whole band. The singing is perfect for the songs. Of course the guitar is dead on.<br />It is rare for a whole album to be so perfect, where every facet of every song is done so well and convincingly.<br />Heck, my only gripe would be that it could use more guitar, but I think that would have thrown off the balance of this great recording.
1904994679|5.0|This is another book I purchase for my nephew every year as a Christmas gift. I do read it and find it AMAZING that so much information is recorded inside.  I didn't think I would find more interesting world records as the 2011 edition but I was wrong.  There are much more interesting world records and I love the detailed photos. Looking forward to 2013's edition! I recommended for any age; young or old.

0767812387|4.0|This movie with Chayanne and Vanessa Williams was great, and funny at times.  It did have its slow moments, but I enjoyed the ballroom dancing, the teaching, and playing around while rehearsing.  What I found fascinating was a caliber of different ages, competing, it became humorous at times.  Chaynne showing Vanessa Williams how he dances salsa making it fun, rather than knowing what the name of the next step is called; loosens the dance floor and makes it a party for Vanessa.  Personally the outcome of the whole movie,is intrigue by him winning her over to have her dance his way and have fun on the dance floor!  I could watch this movie over and over!  Always makes me smile and laugh..a big thumbs up!!!!

B0055PMJMW|5.0|Sometimes you just don't have time to read a book.  These short stories are perfect for those times.  They definitely have the \\"feel\\" of Harry Bosch.  They are very good stories.  I recommend them.
031250926X|5.0|My kids fight over this book  like crazy, I had to come back to Amazon to order more \\"slide and find\\" books for them! This one is my favorite because it is one of our fave stories already. I read the 1-star review where the buyer says she returned this because she was disappointed the last page is missing. Well I just wanted to say that the last page is a review of all the animals in the book and the fact that they couldn't fit it in (this version is already huge) doesn't affect the story at all. So don't be afraid the book abruptly ends or something, if you aren't familiar with this story/book. I don't mind that it is missing and I certainly wouldn't give the book one star because of it. This is a great book and would make a wonderful gift!
1439170916|5.0|I'm a family physician, and I deal with cancer every day that I work.  I initially avoided reading this book for a variety of reasons.  Cancer is a distressing, depressing topic to deal with:  Why would I want to read a moderately lengthy book about something that I've had more than my fill of both professionally and personally (both my parents died of cancer, a year apart)?  I was wrong to avoid it, and when I did read it, found it to be deeply rewarding on two levels, a bit disappointing on a third.<br /><br />Level One:  Medical history.  The history of cancer, dating back to its identification in Egyptian papyruses, then tracing its course up to 2010, was entrancing.  Filled with fascinating anecdotes, descriptions of the lively cast of characters that tried to engage cancer over more than 3000 years of battle, and a clearly laid out scientific history that moves from theories about an overabundance of black bile to the intricate workings of suppressor genes and oncogenes, the book is simply a marvel of illumination.<br /><br />Level Two: A Cautionary Tale.  As the author chronicles the incredibly aggressive approaches that early surgeons and oncologists took toward treating cancers \\"liquid\\" (leukemias) or \\"solid\\" (lung, breast, etc.), one is rocked back on one's heels while contemplating the arrogance and brutality of early and more recent treatments.  How many of the hundreds of thousands of women that received radical mastectomies actually obtained a result superior to that which a simple lumpectomy would have afforded?  NONE, may well be the answer.  When lawsuits (and in some cases, laws) forced HMO's and other health insurance companies to pay for bone marrow transplants for breast cancer victims, the treatments killed more women than they saved, at the cost of many millions of dollars.  Mukherjee also brings to light case after case of medical pioneers that glimpsed truths about cancer, but then were subsequently mocked, persecuted, even run out of their professions for daring to have insight.  Mukherjee also gently, but clearly, points out the dangers of letting the American political process mandate the direction of research, often with tragic consequences.<br /><br />Level Three:  No author is perfectly effective at telling a tale.  Mukherjee is most effective as a historian and a science writer, less so when he tries to plumb the human aspects of an encounter with cancer.  The book begins and ends with descriptions of his relationships with patients with cancer.  These encounters seem a bit heavy on drama, and a bit light on the hard and somewhat mundane work one does while walking a patient through the course of their illness (be it a successful treatment or a failure).<br /><br />Summary?  This book is not just a good book. It is an important and rare book, both in its explanatory power regarding the disease of cancer, and in the lessons that such a thorough and unblinking history of medicine call forth.  It changed the way that I explain cancer to my patients, and it changed the way that I thought about my own profession as a physician.  Having read it, you will not be able to read the news (e.g. the recent recommendation that PSA not be used to routinely screen for cancer)through the same lenses that you used before.ring to have insight.

B0000041DF|5.0|Outstanding interpretation, performance of this   powerful concerto.  Perhaps Rachmaninoff's   most powerful, very complex, very engaging and  moving.  Argerich is very deserving of her   enormous reputation.  An excellent recording.
B002WDL534|2.0|Unfortunately, my LP came with a problem on side A: the tracks were not recorded according to the center of the disc (the stylus tracks the music going visually farward and backward), the music actually plays, but I think that it causes a more intense wear to the stylus and some sound distortion.  The LP is not in the US anymore, I bought it to my sister, and it took some months to have it played and note the problem, so, it's not easy to return it.  Side B is all right.
B005POK858|1.0|Looks like a good game,but sound stops working after battles. Will give better ratting if it gets fixed. Before that I would not waist my money.
B004ZNARH4|3.0|Like so many others here, I anticipated the arrival of a set like this for a very long time. Once I had a chance to delve into its contents, I found myself delighted with some of its offerings, and dismayed with others. Fellow reviewers have already discussed some of the issues at hand here. Nonetheless, I hope the review I'm about to share will add to the conversation, and perhaps shed a little more light on them.    I love a wide variety of music, but DSOTM has always held a very special place in my heart. Ever since I first heard it when I was six years old. It floated into my brain. Permanently inscribing itself in my psyche. Up to the time this set arrived at my doorstep, I've owned two other copies of DSOTM. One of them being a cassette made from the vinyl copy of a relative, and the other, a gold disc from Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab. Before the announcement of the immersion version, I passed on every remaster. Content with what I already had. This set seemed to offer so many options though, and I couldn't resist.    The blu ray in particular is a huge draw for me. So far, my favorite mix has been the uncompressed 1973 original. The sound fills the room with such detail and depth. It's the Dark Side I've always loved, but clearer, brighter, and more richly defined than ever before. The Alan Parsons quad version is also nothing short of spectacular. Unfortunately, my reciever has an issue with that track on the blu ray and wont play it properly, so I've had to hear the quad mix via Dolby on the DVD.    Another highlight of the blu ray, is a roughly 18 minute easter egg. It's hidden in the video sub menu. Highlight the option for the 2003 documentary. Then, press the right arrow on your blu ray remote. After the documentary option turns pink, press enter. You'll then be treated to the Q&A recording session between Roger Waters and roadie Roger The Hat. You know, the guy with the Maniacal laugh in On The Run. A shiny golden egg indeed!    For all that I love about this set though, I can't escape the feeling that the Floyd laid a few eggs here. The two concert cuts from 72' are cool, but they don't look or sound that great. A shabby sounding mix that's clear but dull. Black bars taking up the left and right majority of my high def screen. While the footage itself sits like a slightly oversized postage stamp. Square in the middle and listless. It's the same story with the concert screen films. It's nice to see them, but the experience is diminished because they don't fill the screen.       Also, why no BD Live capability on the blu ray? It would be great to have downloadable content from the Pink Floyd archives. Like a gift that would've kept on giving. In a medium that seems to have so much interactive potential, it's a shame that so many artists, and so many studios drop the ball in that respect. Probably out of ecconomic concern on their part. Since the downloadable content is essentially given away.    It's also a shame to see that the set has been packaged so poorly. Before I recieved mine, I watched a few unboxing videos on Youtube, so I knew what I was in store for. Most of the discs were secure, but my concert CD was loose and scratched. Ugh! Thankfully, it plays fine. I took all the discs straight out of the box and put them in jewel cases. Where they should've been to begin with!The picture books are alright, but with an album as important and meaningful as DSOTM, why not a book full of recollections from other artists about the album? It had enough impact on The Flaming Lips that they released their own version! It would've been great to read stories of how the Floyd's masterpiece has touched so many lives.   The trinkets are quaint, but as other reviewers have also noted, it's totally moronic to have the majority of the discs buried in the bottom of the box. After all, the music and footage on them are my chief reason for buying sets like this. Despite the fact that DSOTM is timeless, and there is a lot to love in this set. It's difficult at times to escape the feeling that it was (almost literally) thrown together, and could've offered us so much more.
0375758992|1.0|I joined a book club in order to broaden my pop book horizons. This is the first book on the reading list, and I am starting to rethink the book club because of it. I was really looking for a good story of living in Africa, and being in the melee of the troubled times of Rhodesia. I have very little time to read a book, and I have gotten half way through this disjointed memory collection of a dysfunctional family via an audiobook. The audio book narrator is good, but the story is just horrible. It is depressing, dysfunctional, and all over the place. I expected to find the book written with a slight racist slant, due to the time and the place, but I didn't expect this. I should have saved my $20 for the audiobook. Its so not worth the money. It should have been re-written as a surviving dysfunctional parents book...there really is no point to the story line.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|This product is exactly as stated. It's the complete Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman series & includes some movies & extras.  I purchased this for my daughters ages 6 & 12.  I remember how much I enjoyed watching as a teen & I wanted to share the experience w/ my children.  This series in my opinion teaches good morals, values & is very educational.  The price was great too!  Thank you very much.
B004DMIIVO|4.0|Starts out slow but once it takes off you're hooked. It was enjoyable for the most part but seemed tailored for a somewhat younger audience. I did not notice that it was rated G until I had already purchased it (not always a bad thing).
B004R6JG7G|5.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The 2.35:1 video was great.  Fantastic mostly, but some of the sky scenes had some fine grain.<br /><br />The DTS-HD 6.1 Master Audio was great also.  I thought the subwoofer channel was a little weak at times.  Dobly 5.1 TrueHD was also an option.
B0053Q9DQI|5.0|I am surprised movies like this are still being made today. The quality of the acting, directing, and (especially) the cinematography are excellent. The use of lighting, in particular, is first rate. I thought the choice of actors was also excellent, without exception. I'm very pleased to have seen this movie, and I will purchase it for my collection.
007174889X|4.0|A little different from the 17th edition, this book comes in 2 volumes and an addition CD that contains chapters the book doesn't and also a few other features such as how to preform certain tests. I purchased this book for a course at my college- it wasn't required but recommended. I found that this book explained things better than some of the teachers notes and was an easy read. The included CD could have been organized better, it runs via an internet browser when opened- I think it's adobe but it opens up through which ever internet browser you use. The CD can be confusing to use and some of the features were hard to use- sometimes the volume didn't work on the included videos. Although the CD was a bit of a bust and the book is rather heavy it is a great text to get if you are interest or currently in a medical career.  4 stars because:  -The CD can be a hit or miss  -The text is a great learning and refreshing tool
034552554X|3.0|I Gave this book a #3 out of 5.  I found it disconcerting that each chapter bounced from past to present. It was informative about the Victorian Dictionary of Flowers.  It made you question adoption and foster care. Most of the characters were unlikeable. Not a book I would recommend although it made for a very good discussion at our book club
B003L77GGK|5.0|I'll make this short since so many have given some great details.  Yes, it is different from the first couple of seasons---instead of the different jobs they work each week, there is a larger plot from episode to episode.  Either way, I  love this show.  If you are a fan of the show, I don't think differences from this season would really change that.
B000VZBCWE|5.0|This remains one of my favorites. I really love the look they had at the time they did rock Montreal. One of the things that is so interesting about Freddie is that he changed his look throughout his singing career. He was younger and really into it in this video. It is enjoyable start to finish. Makes me feel like I'm there in the audience. He was very loose and spontaneous in this concert. I have several different ones and to me this one is special. You'll love another one bites the dust and the reaction of the audience. They give their all and you can see that they are genuinely enjoying giving it their all. Live aid is a separate DVD. To see that entire queen famous gig is priceless. To see it anytime you want to is even more priceless! I chose the video duo for my grown daughters 47th birthday. She and I are the queen lovers in the family. My other most favorite is singer of songs video with the bonus untold story of Freddies life from beginning to end. It is a must have also. I recommend this as a vitally necessary set for all Queen lovers and if you're not already then you will be after you see what's on these 2 videos. Thank you for making these. They are a true treasure that I have watched many times and will watch always. This is the best![[ASIN:B000VZBCWE Queen Rock Montreal + Live Aid]]
0345529057|5.0|Wonderful series..hope HBO finishes the series in movie form..it's exciting, well written, the author brings each charactor  to life in a broad sense of feeling with their thoughts, lives, passions and loves in a particular way and I got into the books immediately. I was mesmerized by the way the scenes came off the page & put you in the books and made them alive for you. Every chapter cuts to the chase & takes you to the next on e without you having to go back and feel your way around again to remember what was going on even tho' some characters had different names, same person & the tension the author brought to culmination always gave you a surpris that was so unexpected that you never saw what was coming....what an exciting series of works...Martin is a \\"period pice\\" master...hope to read more of this kind of works fom him. while the violence could be graphic is was  exactly what you would expect to experience of those times.  OUTSTANDING  Masterful!  Paula Welch
B004LWZW4W|5.0|this movie is the best of all the Planet of the apes including the cartoon series and the unofficial puppet movie the plot works with the old series and yet explains much the others missed the human forced evolution proves much more believable than a time paradox
B005J0VPNC|1.0|I don't quite understand what the point of the paper thing is. If you get rid of that, this is just $2 camera that can't really do anything. It would have been unique if you could put your pictures in a paper-type frame, like the one that is used to take the picture.
1400049628|5.0|A great book about how to survive the impending zombie apocalypse. Don't buy this book expecting it to be making a ton of jokes or read like a novel.

1441866868|3.0|I really enjoyed the book - science fiction of the highest order - good characters and premise.  As for the recordings, I'm not as enthusiastic.  Part of the problem is the book itself - the start of the novel is fairly flat without a lot of action and doesn't lend itself to audio dramatization and the narration could have been better.  Three and a half stars.  I'd recommend reading the book if possible, rather than listening to it on disc.
030746363X|5.0|Tim Ferriss is a bright, curious, adventurous and entertaining writer.  I love his two books and find nuggets of information every time I return to read his material.  The naysayers are probably inherently glass half empty personalities.  This book has something for everyone IF you are interested in self improvement.
B004ZGYEKC|5.0|Just got this the other day from the Amazon marketplace......Alot of bonus tracks including the stereo version, long version of Sunshine Superman and a ton of other goodies.  Nice photos, and its truly cool to see this getting the proper reissue treatment from EMI.
0553801473|2.0|I have just finished A Dance with Dragons and I must say that I am very disappointed. I am one of the few people who enjoyed A Feast for Crows along with the previous three books. But I really had trouble with this book.<br />I thought people were being harsh when I was reading reviews before I read the book, but realised they were just being honest.<br />The plot really doesn't move forward at all, I'm not exagerating either. The characters (most) have gone completely stale. The characters that were interesting still were given the absolute minimum page count and then discarded at any random point within the book.<br />For a novel that took 6 years to write, the last thing people want is cliffhangers, yet what do we get!? I am amazed that such a lazy author (Two books in 11 years) is allowed to finish a book in such ways. The Editors should be ashamed of themselves for such a lack of respect towards the customer (us). They should also be fired or have the dignity to resign due to their horrific job at editing this.<br />I honestly do think that George RR Martin is an excellent author, one of the best in any catagory writing today, which makes this such a shame. He still has brilliant prose and a way of bringing things together within the story that most are unable of doing.<br />I will mark this down as one big mistake on his part and hope that if or when we get the next instalment, it returns to previous form. This could still be a master piece, but much more effort is needed. Also, all the 5* reviews are surely bogus!? Either that or some people are VERY easily pleased.
0345495004|5.0|Author Nancy Horan thoroughly researched the scandal at the turn of the century when married parents Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Cheney left their homes and families to be together.  Having had a clandestine love affair when they met (Wright was designing a home for the Cheneys), Mamah and Frank make the ultimate sacrifice to be together against societal norms of the time.  Anchoring her tale of the romance, their life together, and the subsequent tragedy that befell them Horan writes some of the most fascinating historical fiction of recent years.<br /><br />I confess that the tale has staying power, and having determined the book, released in 2007, to be one of my favorite reads of 2010, I am trying to make plans to find a way to Spring Green, Wisconsin, to see the reborn structure (Taliesin III) that was built at the site of their life together.<br /><br />Without going into details of the story (the other reviewers have done a fine job) let me just say that Horan brings Mamah Cheney to life, and, as seen through her eyes, fills in some of the blanks about the man that is considered to be America's finest architect.<br /><br />Fascinating read.  Highly recommended.
B001E9641K|5.0|This is a lot of fun to play, different than the original \\"Ticket to Ride\\", and the changed rules make it a new game.  It is for only 2 or 3 players.  We played with 3 players, and it was very enjoyable, even for the players who play the original a lot.  We plan to try it with teams when we get more people to play it.

B005BGBPBG|5.0|Something borrowed was a terrific film, I put off watching it for weeks because it did not look promising but I was shockingly overjoyed, and most satisfied with the film. For some reason I could not stop laughing at John Krasinski. He should definitely win an award for best supporting actor. Everytime he got any on screen laughter would just bubble out from me not stop!.<br />  Kate hudson as always is a rare gem like her mother Goldie Hawn. And kate is one of my favorite actresses. I could not get over how dazzling Ginnifer goodwin was. I feel that this was a break-out performance that could mold her already established movie career into super stardom! I never knew how beautifl and sparkling gorgeous that young lady is!<br />  I saw a lot of bad reviews for this cinematic adventure but most of them may have forgot this was a romantic comedy and that;s exactly what it did; it was a story of a romance \\"briefly borrowing\\" a love relationship among best friends with a family pack-size helping of laughter and humor to go with it! I dont' buy any movies at all, but this one goes on the shelf!<br />  Colin egglesfield played a good leading role as the somewhat shy sensible, smart, and practical one who does learn to follow the path to burning embers of heart-filled love on his own path to life. Steve howey is brilliant in the ghoulish funny guy he brings to life as Ginnifer goodwin put it \\"take something gross or perverse and make it charming.\\"<br />  I want to say I gave this movie 5 stars because the cast, crew and directors earned it, not because i was laughing the whole time, was not bored but instead interested in the storyline so much to be laughing one minute, and crying either tears of joy or emotions of despair the next. It also was not the fact that the 2 leading ladies are so fabulously brilliant , gorgeous, and at the top of their game as female actors but because the movie flows smoothly without any awkardness revealing a love tale of 2 fresh college students who find their way into each other's hearts by friendship and also real love but get sidetracked by others who don't wait for life to happen. It's a story that fate will again join soulmates that we all may have a happy ending! Thanks and Godblesseir way into each other's hearts by friendship and also real love but get sidetracked by others who don't wait for life to happen. It's a story that fate will again join soulmates that we all may have a happy ending! Thanks and Godbless
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|\\"Real Steel\\" is great! This is how the story goes: In the near-future, where the sport of boxing has gone hi-tech, Charlie Kenton is a washed-up fighter who lost his chance at a title when 2000-pound, 8-foot-tall steel robots took over the ring. Now nothing but a small-time promoter, Charlie earns just enough money piecing together low-end bots from scrap metal to get from one underground boxing venue to the next. When Charlie hits rock bottom, he reluctantly teams up with his estranged son Max to build and train a championship contender. As the stakes in the brutal, no-holds-barred arena are raised, Charlie and Max, against all odds, get one last shot at a comeback.  The cast led by Hugh Jackman (as Charlie) is great. The directing by Shawn Levy (who also produced) is great. The story by Dan Gilroy & Jeremy Leven & the screenplay by John Gatins is great.  The music by Danny Elfman is great. The cinematography by Mauro Fiore is great. The film editing by Dean Zimmerman is great. The casting by Richard Hicks & David Rubin is great. The production design by Tom Meyer is great. The art direction by Seth Reed, Jason Baldwin Stewart & Jeff Wisniewski is great. The set decoration by Victor J. Zolfo is great. The costume design by Marlene Stewart is great.  This is a great boxing drama with great family values instilled in it. This is fun, entertaining and fast-paced. Hugh Jackman is great, as usual. This is another great film from Shawn Levy. This is \\"Rocky\\" meets \\"Transformers\\".
B001HN6922|2.0|This is a typical garbage Hollywood film.  The first Cars movies was totally awesome and this movie does it no justice at all.  Just a movie taking cheap shots at the oil industry.  This seems to be a theme with movies now though (portraying corporations or people as evil. Wall E, Bee Movie, Avatar).  Had high hopes for this movie but it didn't entertain my kids at all.  They turned it off and popped on Spiderman on netflix.  Too bad......
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Victoria, the story's protagonist, is one of the finer characters I've come across in some time.  This isn't to say she is not flawed; on the contrary, she's almost broken at times.  Somehow, I found myself pitying her, frustrated with her and loving her all at once, and never did I once sense the author's efforts to evoke these feeling in the reader.  Some stories go on and on with orphaned protagonists and every heart wrenching thing they endured.  Outside of the memories of her time with her most memorable and influential guardian, we only get a glimpse of her other trials and tribulations, bringing truth to \\"less is more.\\"  In regard the reviews that mentioned not liking the end, I will only guess that this is because some readers like an ending that feels completely sealed.  This book ends like reality.  There is no end; there is only \\"this will work for now.\\"
0446585025|5.0|Extremely funny book. Intended for my mom but I can say we both enjoy it and love how fast it got to me. Ordered it tue Zon got it to me by Saturday. No complaints whatsoever
1449408656|5.0|Frankly, I don't know how someone wouldn't love this book. It's witty, funny, and oh so true.<br /><br />I've been a longtime reader of Yasmine's blog and the book is just a super awesome extension of the blog - several of the same comics, with plenty of new ones that I didn't recognize. Yasmine is a natural-born storyteller and it's hard not to love her work.<br /><br />Cat owners will groan - everything reeks of truth - but it's funny anyway.<br /><br />Great as a gift or a coffee table book. You'll read through it over and over, enjoying the pictures and the laughter each time.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Just works great and is very entertaining on my samsung epic, very addictive. Great physics and graphics, this definitely replaces angry birds as my time waster
B004UPANAI|1.0|ok, i get it, sometimes the movie version is always what it's cracked up to be, but they did a COMPLETE HACK-JOB on this one!!!  i was looking forward to this movie from the day i heard rumors that it was in the works for production.  recalling how much i enjoyed the graphic novel, and how cool i thought it was going to be on the big screen, only to see a COMPLETELY different, and not clever or good different, version on screen.  i was very happy that i got this dvd as a gift and didn't spend my own money on it, and i was even happier that i was able to sell it!  for x-men fans, you're missing nothing but disappointment, for non-x-men fans, maybe on a lazy sunday, when it's on tv, with commercials, because at least some of the commercials will be worth watching!!!

B005NFVZTM|5.0|...first - i have to say - michael fassbender...WHAT A FREAKING BABE!!!!!!!!!!  holy 'bleep'!!!  thought he was very 'striking/handsome' in 'inglourious basterds', that classic hollywood handsome ya just don't see that often anymore...but in 'x-men'...he's downright SEXY AS 'BLEEP'!!!  and i never thought i'd see the day that i would drool over any other than patrick stewart/charles xavier...  ok, so now, the movie:  it was AWESOME!!!  more than i had expected it to be!  great story line, great script, holding true to the 'mod decor' was fun for the eyes, just the right amount of action and effects, i really loved this movie!!  can't say the same for 'wolverine origins', i'm greatful i got that dvd as a gift...and was able to sell it!  really bad movie!  i think for any x-men fan, you'll get a kick outta this movie, even for those who aren't!  now, i know some movie snobs that picked it apart to death!  but they're the type of people who don't like a single movie in general!!!  if you haven't seen it, watch it, it's totally worth it!

B0058VW36U|5.0|Love it.  Addicting and puzzling at the same time.  All the levels are doable, and some require lateral thinking.  Not as frustrating as angry birds since you can skip levels and come back to it later.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|The first few pages were hard to follow, but then it really caught my interest. I couldn't put the book down and really tore at my heart strings. MUST READ!
0439023513|5.0|I was very anxious to get the whole series, and this completed my set.  It is in excellent shape and was delivered very quickly.  It is an excellent book, I recommend it to anyone over than age 10.
B0036S4CTS|4.0|The first few chapters were hard for me to get through as I almost gave up and deleted it from my Kindle. I am SO glad that I didn't as this is one of my favorite books ever. It reminded me that everyday holds the possibility of a miracle and that things happen for a reason.
1423140591|5.0|As my title suggests, I am done with Son of Neptune and to my displeasure I will have to wait until October 2012 for Mark of Athena (Lost Hero and Son of Neptune both released in October). Fortunately I will have Book 3 of the Kane Chronicles to look forward to this May.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br />The book left me amazed at how creative Riordan has mapped out each of his series. The Heroes of Olympus saga is a particular challenge. Riordan has established that seven heroes are destined to save the world from Gaea, which requires Riordan to give us very interesting and very diverse heroes. We pretty much have an understanding now of who these seven heroes are: Jason (Son of Jupiter), Percy (Son of Poseidon), Piper (Daughter of Aphrodite), Leo (Son of Hephaesteus), Frank (Son of Mars), Hazel (Daughter of Pluto) and now it seems Annabeth (Daughter of Athena). For the new characters we see how Riordan weaves interesting storylines for each of these characters and how they come to join together for this huge threat (ex. Hazel coming back from the dead after 70 years)<br /><br />Plus you have the additional new characters from Camp Jupiter and Riordan's continuation of characters from the Percy Jackson saga.<br /><br />I personally can't wait to see how Annabeth reacts to Percy's return as well as Reyna's reaction to seeing her old flame, Jason in love with Piper. Too bad I have to wait another twelve months to find out.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|A must watch for anyone that eats food. It's quite amazing how our food, arguably one of the most important things in our lives is brought to our table.
B004EPZ070|1.0|I don't normally go for 'romantic comedies'. They're just not really something I enjoy, but I love Kate Hudson (How to Lose a guy in 10 days is the only romantic comedy I've ever liked) and Ginnifer Goodwin, so I gave this a chance. Bad idea.   The actors in this are great...I had no problems with any of the actors (though Hudson was a bit over the top for my taste) my dislike for this movie stems soley from the writing and the plot.  Darcy has NO redeaming qualities. She's self-centered, spoiled, loud, brash, drunk all the time, mean, an attention seeker, cruel and stupid. While Rachel is shown to be a doormat of sorts, I still don't think anyone would put up with Darcy for YEARS. And why would Dex, protrayed as a do-gooder, simple guy who's main issue is a need to please his parents, fall for her (the 'he's never met anyone like me/I'm so hot' reason provided is ridiculous) AND marry her? Why would his rich, stuck up parents approve of her in the first place?  The character I really liked, Ethan, totally gets the shaft in this movie. SPOILERS: HE'S the one Rachel should end up with, but after confessing his feelings in a truly humble and believeable way, she essentially pats him on the head and he fades into the background never to be heard from again. He deserved more and was thrown away.  But the biggest issue with this movie? The complete lack of a moral code by ANY of the characters. Darcy and Dex are engaged. Rachel is Darcy's best friend who has had a thing for Dex since they met (before Darcy and Dex met). Supposedly Dex has had feelings for Rachel since that point, too, but just decided to get with Darcy anyway (WHAT??). Anyway, Rachel and Dex end up having sex then having a drawn out affair. This is SO wrong! I don't care that Darcy is a total tart with no redeaming qualities...you don't sleep with your best friend's fiance! Yet neither Dex nor Rachel seem to have an issue with this (they say they feel bad about it but still continue). You get the impression that Rachel feels it's OK for her to do this because Darcy has 'taken everything in life that Rachel wanted'. Sorry, but no. You owe it to your self-proclaimed best friend to stay away from her fiance (or make him break up with her first or something!). The whole thing was just wrong.  SPOILERS: Darcy later reveals that she has also had an affair in recent months (why she does this is never really explained other than that Dex hasn't had sex with her in awhile and she has a 'connection' to this other guy). Darcy eventually finds out about Rachel and Dex, screams that she hates Rachel (over-dramatic considering Darcy had just said she was 'happy' with the affair guy) and storms away. Two months later, each girl is 'happy' with life. WRONG. You don't get to live happily ever after after you destroy your best friend's relationship by sleeping with her finace! NO. This isn't romantic, it's terrible.  I ended up hating most of the characters and sitting in disbelief as the ending was presented as happy despite the horrible way the story had played out. I hate that this film promotes cheating as a way to get what you want. As if the morals of this country weren't bad enough (I don't want to be preachy...I hate those kinds of movies, too, but this was so ridiculous) you give people the idea that fidelity is over-rated.    Overall I think the actors did a great job with what they had to work with, but all of them should have passed on this film. Honestly, don't waste your time with this!
030788743X|3.0|There are soooo many smart, interesting, good ideas in Ernest Cline's debut novel, Ready Player One.  I mean like China Mieville ([[ASIN:034549752X The City & The City (Random House Reader's Circle)]]), Richard K Morgan ([[ASIN:0345480899 Thirteen]]) or Grant Morrison ([[ASIN:1401200133 The Filth]]) levels of smart, interesting, good ideas.  If my listing out of genre contemporaries and their work just bothered you in this review, you may want to stay away from this book - because it does that with 1980s and computer game pop culture.  A lot.<br /><br />At times, Cline's writing becomes too much like the futuristic hipsters that are his protagonists.  There's only so much \\"movie, game or album 'X' is awesome and I have seen/played/heard it 482 times\\" that this reader can take.  As a cautionary tale about the dangers of relying too heavily on technology, Ready Player One is as rich in insights as Blade Runner and Rush's 2112 (both of which are referenced and name-checked prominently in the novel).  Fascinating ideas about where our current cultural direction could take us on topics such as gender, commerce, education and worker's rights abound in the novel, and often come so fast that you wish Cline would spend more time exploring them.<br /><br />Ready Player One is a good adventure story - the stakes seem appropriately large and the villains realistically threatening.  And there's also a very sweet coming of age story here, with fairly well developed themes on the importance of human contact and love being more powerful than fear.  But with both, Cline too often tells instead of shows.  It's one thing to watch someone play an exciting game or fall in love, and another to have them tell you about it later.<br /><br />As with the list at the outset of this review, the scattered nature of it is an indication of how reading the novel felt for me.  There's a lot of stuff that I really liked in it, but I was often worn down by the ADHD nature of its presentation.  Perhaps a more visual medium like comics or movies (the bio identifies Cline as a screenwriter) would be a better way to present the material - it's definitely worth getting out there, just maybe with a more streamlined delivery.mics or movies (the bio identifies Cline as a screenwriter) would be a better way to present the material - it's definitely worth getting out there, just maybe with a more streamlined delivery.

B004T5R2HQ|5.0|This app is great for scanning thing using your phone for you to work with on my computer. I love this app and use it all the time!
B0041KKYGU|2.0|The trailers were skillfully editted and presented a funny and cute movie.  The title is accurate - \\"bad teacher\\" - language, sex, drugs, shallow nature all of which would be inappropriate for a young audience.  A more mature audience would probably not appreciate this movie.  Teenage boys will likely give this movie 5 stars.  Where as an adult might rate this at 2-3 stars.  Teachers may find this movie offensive.
B0055SWM08|5.0|a beautiful and fun puzzle game. I would recommend it to everyone. The graphics are crisp and clean. Samsung Galaxy S.
B004LKVHSY|1.0|This is a good film but the quality falls way short of Blu-ray capabilities and many SD DVD releases - in a word \\"dire\\". Releasing films with such poor picture quality could make Blu-ray, already off to a poor start a non-starter. We need some sort of vetting that stops such poor quality films/transfers being released on Blu-ray before we can take the Blu-ray format to mean better picture quality and not just higher cost than standard DVD.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app is a great time killer. It is progressively challenging and is well thought out. Well worth the $.99. I love it.
B000RZGFYS|5.0|Reign In Blood is an absolute classic.  The songs are all great and the production is way better than on their first 2, ahead of it's time. I can tell that Hell Awaits is older because of the production but Reign in Blood has a very quality production and it holds up very well considering it's from 1986. It's also their fastest album to date, very few slower parts in it. The guitar solos are decent but the drumming really improved a lot on here. The tempo changes aren't as frequent as on Hell Awaits but faster and more sudden. It isn't as dark as Hell Awaits or Show no Mercy, it's less complex and more straight forward thrash/speed metal. Reign In Blood is solid throughout and even though I'd take Seasons over it since it's more technical, complex and mature, Reign In Blood is still arguably one of the greatest albums of all time. It influenced and changed metal over the years. Necrphobic, Angel of Death, Reborn, Postmortem and Piece By Piece are the best.
B004U8VQOW|5.0|Not sure what the other people who gave this video poor reviews are watching or seeing but this video is awesome. I originally saw it in an IMAX theater at the Wright Patterson Air Force museum and it was FAR FAR better than looking at any pictures on some website. I've watched countless documentaries on space, going to the moon, etc and although this is the shortest, it also had the biggest WOW factor for me. It does document a large portion of the astronauts experience while fixing the Hubble but that's fine by me. My favorite parts are the shuttle launch and soaring through galaxies as if you're in a plane flying at thousands of light years a second.

B001VNB54A|4.0|Any movie that gets tears out of my eyes is usually going to get 4 stars at least from me........ They picked several real guys and portrayed their war lives (and later followed up on their future with real documentaries and interviews)............<br /><br />The movie was well made, seemed real enough, bloody but not outright gorey for the sake of it, and I will probably watch it again in several years. If I had a minor point or complaint, it was the theme music....... could have been better to get you in the spirit (Like Band of Brothers)......

0439023513|2.0|I've never written a review but I feel compelled to now.    Have you ever finished reading a book that disappoints and then sit it down quietly on your coffee table, stand up, stretch, pace around the house a few times, vacuum the floor...all the while thinking of how that book could've ended differently?  Then go to your laptop and Google reviews of the book you already read, seeing if others had the same reaction that you had?  Maybe even searching online for \\"books like ________ but with better ending?\\"  Trying to feed that hunger to finish a book that offered a rewarding experience chock full of imagery, an emotional journey, and most importantly in the last book of a trilogy...CLOSURE!  Yep, that's me after reading Mockingjay.  The whole book was a big let down in every way.  This book took the characters I treasured and shattered them.  Katniss no longer a strong, gritty warrior but a sniveling, wretched heap of a mess the whole book through.  All of the qualities I cherished about Peeta were stripped away from him; not to mention that he was absent through a good portion of book which was very disappointing for me.  And what about Gayle?  Where is the character we met back in the woods of District 12?  Even Finnick-- to build his character and back-story so well only to end it so idiotically.  Death by a pack of angry mutts?  Really?  I understand the point Suzanne Collins may have been trying to make about the effects and tragedy of war.  That said, it still felt as though she didn't think much about the reader's experience.  Did she purposely want her readers to suffer this way at the end?  Or did she just want to complete the series and move on (maybe because she was more motivated to get going on the movie's screenplay).    Mockingjay, what a waste of a great idea.
B004J88SGC|5.0|I had only one solid reason to purchase this item, okay, well two.  First I looooove Billy.  Second, while I was in the hospital with my newborn daughter, this concert came on during one of the public television fundraisers in the wee hours of the morning.  Being a new mom, I wasn't sure how to calm her so I did what helps me.  I immediately picked her up and began to sing the songs and rocked her to the beats.  Needless to say, she was mesmerized and calmed down.  Only being a few hours old, she stayed up for the whole concert! When I got this home, I played it for her.  Her feet started bopping and her hands started twirling!  There's definitely something special about Billy!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|THE WALKING DEAD  I have been reading the comic since it was released and that is no lie. I am a big fan of zombies in any format mainly because my brother is literally scared of them. I can't help it but I love it. So when I first that the comic was being turned into a series I was super excited. I had always believed that this would be the right format for such a grand story. If this was made into a feature film there is no way it could fit all that it would need to.  Now as a big fan of the comic from Robert Kirkman I could tell you anything that is spot on direct and anything changed but that would take the fun out of it. Plus for any one who has not read it or is not a comic reader this is a very stand alone show. Any one who has read the comic I will say that you should not be disappointed, sure the comic is classic but this show is also really good. Well cast, acted, written, and directed, I would have to say that this was and is a great show.  The great first season was six episodes long with each paced very well and surprisingly kept in tact what the comic was about. That of course is the humans and not the zombies; it really is a character driven story. I knew with Frank Darabont on board this would be made right. He did a great job here has I really enjoyed this show, from TV all the way to DVD/Blu-Ray.  The story follows a cop named Rick Grimes who is shot in the line of duty; he ends up in a coma. When he finally awakes no one is to be found and he is all alone, alone in the hospital. He now is on the hunt for his wife and son who as far as he knows are missing. Everything he knew and loved is gone, and besides meeting two new friends they go their own ways. He heads to Atlanta based on a tip to find his family and runs into undead and other survivors along the way. Now outside of the city it turns out wife Lori and his son Carl are with another group of survivors including Rick's best friend and co worker Shane Walsh. They all believe Rick to be dead so that leads to an interesting dynamic for our little group of friends.  Like I said before this is a character driven story and it really helps the show out. Now of course the \\"walkers\\" are there ready to eat all humans, and there are a lot of them. When there is action there is some good action but the story is really strongest amongst the living. So one group is already out there surviving and one man is out there in the middle of it all looking for his family. Do they find each other, well I say watch the show or read the comic to find out.  I will just say that the entire cast was great in my opinion and were wonderfully cast. So there is no need to go one by one since they were all great. Of the six episodes Frank Darabont was a writer on four and directed the first episode. I would also like to point out that Ernest Dickerson directed an episode, you may know him as a Spike Lee protégé who directed classics like \\"Juice\\" and \\"Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight\\". Any way the writers and directors for this sure all did a good job here.  Now special features for the two disc set include a making of, inside each episode, sneak peaks, behind the scenes, a convention panel, and the trailer. Now of course now they have released a three disc edition to get more money out of me. Of course I am going to shell out even though I really shouldn't. I hear there are commentaries on each episode, dang them for adding that. I am a big fan of this so I need to get it.
B004M9AS3Y|4.0|I'm keeping my earlier review because the straps remain a problem, especially as a biking backpack; however, I am upgrading my review because the pack works reasonably well for hiking. I spent a week in Istanbul last year, and it held my camera equipment and a few other items for the long days. I also used it in hiking and climbing in the Adirondacks last summer. Again, it's not perfect. The straps are just wrong, and it could use a tripod strap, but I have found it useful.<br /><br />(previous review)<br />I  almost returned this pack, but it was a gift, so I kept it. The pack itself is ideal for carrying what I need on long bike rides, but the straps are a problem. They don't fit snuggly, and this pack could use a support strap around the torso. In fact, I've been trying to figure out how to retrofit it. It would makea a world of difference. As it is, I think I missed an opportunity to get what I need by settling for this, and I'm disappointed.

B000GCFO0I|5.0|As the title. Silent Hill is the best horror movie ever. Not only because it is scary. But because it makes us think. When I've done watching this movie, what left in my mind is not those frightening monsters, but the faith we believe in, the justice we think is right, and the person I loved. Is what I think right really right? Are they the truth?
B004I2K4E8|4.0|very nice and new stage design, excellent visual and audio recordings.  lea is still wonderful.  however nick jonas is a disappointment.  his voice is a mismatch and a distraction.  the reunion with the 10th anniversary dreamcast at the end is fabulous, just to see how the cast has aged but still keep the edge.

B004GTQ4DI|5.0|Return to Cranford (2009)<br /><br />This is not really a sequel (though some story arcs from the original do get developed here), but a 2-part special that is inspired in part by Cranford, and also two other stories by author Elizabeth Gaskell, i.e. \\"The Moorland Cottage\\", and also \\"The Cage at Cranford\\", see Three Tales of Cranford: Cranford, The Cage at Cranford, and The Moorland Cottage. Besides the familiar and beloved cast of the original Cranford such as Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench), Miss Pole (Imelda Staunton), Mrs Forrester (Julia McKenzie), Miss Tomkinson (Deborah Findlay), etc. several new characters are introduced, such as Lady Glenmire (played by Celia Imrie), and the conjuror Signor Brunoni(Tim Curry).<br /><br />The first part is set in summer 1844 - it has been two years since dear Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench in another luminous portrayal) lost her beloved sister Deborah, and a year since Sophy Hutton married Dr Harrison (these two characters are no longer in this show). Miss Matty seems content with the presence of her brother Peter (Nicholas Le Prevost) who is home from India, and helps look after Tilly, the baby of her maid Martha and carpenter Jem Hearne. The continuity from the original Cranford is seen in the railway project which still looms menacingly over the town. Things are also made more exciting with the arrival of Mr. Buxton, a wealthy widower who lives with his ward Erminia (Michelle Dockery) and his son William (Tom Hiddleston who is quite the eye candy). Life in Cranford is always full of surprises and when Lady Ludlow's long absent son Septimus (Rory Kinnear) arrives, things take unexpected turns, precipitated by a tragedy in the family. The old tensions are there - especially between those that are against the railroad project and those ,like Captain Brown and young William who feel that modernization is essential to Cranford's long-term survival. Miss Matty, in her usual subtle fashion, gets involved in some of these village proceedings, with some rather startling results.<br /><br />The second part is set later in the year 1844, October up till Christmas - Miss Matty and her friends are predictably excited at the visit of Lady Glenmire (Celia Imrie) but when Mrs Jamieson (Barbara Flynn) feels no one amongst her peers is of suitably high rank to meet her, she and Lady Glenmire get snubbed by Matty and company and it is left to Lady Glenmire to set things right in a most memorable way. Matty also faces some challenges that involves a falling out amongst her circle of friends,a serious romance between William and a young woman deemed unsuitable by his father (which has Matty pondering the wisdom of her 'involvement' in bringing the pair together), and more tragedy on the horizon, affecting the citizens of Cranford.<br /><br />A fair note of warning - this particular installment in the Cranford franchise is much more subdued than the original and there's quite a fair bit of tragedy - there's death (involving a couple of familiar characters who were also in the original), grief, tension, family drama, imperiled friendships, the age-old battle between those opposed to change and those who embrace the challenges of modernization, etc., but there's also romance and lighthearted moments. However, I can understand how this particular follow-up might disappoint purists who loved the original and how well it adhered to Gaskell's novel. Personally, I loved the original Cranford and thought it was a superior production, and though I like RTC, the plot is not as engaging as the original. As for the production qualities - they are excellent. The cinematography is gorgeous, capturing the beauty of the village surroundings as well as the period details, and the score complements the story perfectly.ther startling results.

B002APU580|5.0|I loved the fact that this movie stuck to the most important themes of the story ... the main hero and heroine's love story ... and didn't dwell too much on anything else, except if it was related to the main love affair.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the cinematography. They did a great job in showing the beauty of Great Britain. I visited when I was a teen, and I haven't been back to visit again. I almost felt like I could feel and smell it while watching the outdoor / nature shots in this well-crafted film.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002APU580 Pride & Prejudice]] deserves every bit of attention it has gotten in these reviews. Check it out for yourself to see if you like it.
B002ZG9774|5.0|This movie was surprising...I wasn't expecting to to be so awesome...or to be anything at all. I'm not even into Dreamgirls, Rent, Chicago, Hairspray...etc.-singing movies (unless it involves Gene Kelly or Judy Garland). But, this movie blew me away. I just happen to catch it on tv and fell in love. Christina was amazing, I cant believe how much she slimmed down for the movie. Not that I actually care about her weight, but she looks like she did when she was 17; tiny. Cher, was Cher...she played her role well. Oh and I cant forget about the guy from Twilight; Cam Gigandet. Hotttt...is an understatment. Overall, buy this movie. It's worth it...it's going straight on my xmas list :) as we speak (write)-eh.
B005OYKIJ0|4.0|I really liked this sequel even more than the original and the other sequels so far because the scenery in Brazil and the music were so amazing. Also, I loved to see The Rock and Vin Diesel doing the action scenes together, BUT I felt they got a little too carried away with breaking walls in the fight scene.<br />The cars and the driving were great, of course; and then the little teaser at the end was a welcomed surprise. Looking forward to the next sequel. :)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005OYKI1I Fast Five (Extended Version)]] is a great action move and a great compromise for my husband and I to watch together 'cause there's also a good love story in it, too.
B004EPYZU8|3.0|Nice change of pace movie. Definitely not for those who do not want a cerebral challenge. Still had to shake my head and think at the very end.
1596432594|5.0|This graphic novel is quite unique.  It made the life of a great thinker seem very real to me.  I enjoyed his layman's explanations of some of his quantum physics concepts.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|Basically a good 'robbers' flick, but had a few flaws. The Boston accents were a bit forced by some characters, but the slang and words used were dead on. Film took some liberties with traditional police procedure. Film also bypassed any idea of serious federal involvement, which is always present in the area.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Stardust is a great film, enjoyable for children and adults alike.  It's a story full of imagination and acted superbly!  Not to be missed.
0385534639|4.0|[review of the audio novel] Night Circus was made to be narrated by Jim Dale (think \\"Pushing Daisies\\"). It is interesting that Dale starred as P.T. Barnum in the musical Barnum, because The Night Circus could be seen as the origin of the Bailey circus. That is a loose connection, but the novel relies on loose connections. One such is the premise that a Merlin-like magician holds a series of contests with his first pupil to test which of their styles of magic is superior. Each picks a player and that player with greater endurance wins. One can be forgiven for guessing that as soon as male and female players are picked, the tale will evolve a romance, ending the contest in stalemate -- and so it does, leaving management of the circus (venue for the contest) to the character Bailey.   Lush descriptions delivered by Mr Dale's fairy tale voice enhance the novel and smooth some of its rough edges. There is also, as of this posting, an online interactive narrative set in the same world.
B003A9OVS0|4.0|This album drove me crazy for quite a while.  When listening to the album straight through (what do you mean no one does that anymore?), I liked tracks individually, but disliked the album as a whole.  Because of that, I started listening on shuffle: suddenly the album made sense.  I set about re-ordering the tracks in a way that made sense, and came up with the following:  1 = 13 \\"Plastic Beach\\": the title track makes a lot more sense as the opener.  the moody guitar line, the spacey feel, albarn's voice: it sets up the album a lot better than the orchestra-snoop dogg combo.  2 = 9 \\"some kind of nature\\": bouncy, contrasts with the prior track well and brings the tone of the album back up.  3 = 6 \\"superfast jellyfish\\": keeps the bouncy feel going.  seems to follow better to me than \\"on melancholy hill\\"  4 = 8 \\"glitter freeze\\": moderates the bouncy feel from the last two tracks, and keeps things driving forward.  5 = 5 \\"stylo\\": keeps the driving feel from the last track, follows really nicely from the ending of \\"glitter freeze\\"  6 = 4 \\"rhinestone eyes\\": pulls back from the driving feel  7 = 3 \\"white flag\\": with how strident the previous track ends, the intro here is a very nice contrast.  the bass-heavy rest of the the song is a nice contrast as well.  8 = 16 \\"pirate jet\\": pulls you back from the club and into the story of the album.  9 = 7 \\"empire ants\\": the previous track fades out to nothing, and hearing the intro to this track is almost like starting a new album.  very much a rebirth, and works much more strongly than it would have following \\"superfast jellyfish\\"  10 = 11 \\"broken\\": a nice slow jam to keep the mood rising  11 = 10 \\"on melancholy hill\\": brings the mood up a bit more.  12 = 12 \\"sweepstakes\\": for how organic-feeling the previous three tracks were, this is a hard cut that i think works well.  13 = 14 \\"to binge\\": there's a similarity to the synth line from this and the previous track that works well. it's also a hard cut in feel as much as the last track was.   14 = 15 \\"cloud of unknowing\\": kept this and the last together, not only as the have a natural flow, but because the previous track doesn't really end and flows straight into this one.  15 = 1 \\"orchestral intro\\": the last track closes on an orchestral outro with beach and sea sounds, and this felt like a natural fit.  16 = 2 \\"welcome to the world of the plastic beach\\": i hated this song when i first heard it.  it is not put as the closing track due to that, though.  the first time i heard this track in this location (after listening to the rest of the album), it really did give me chills.  it has a sound to it like it should have been here all along, like the exit music to a 70's blaxploitation film.  hearing it in this context made it one of my favorite songs.  and how awesome is it to end the album with snoop in solo mode.  it doesn't hurt that there's also great symmetry with the intro track name, and saying \\"welcome to...\\" after the whole album has played)  i think this album, as originally presented, is a fine example of the downfall of the album-as-whole.  this could with a little consideration, and maybe some presentation management, become one of the best *albums* of 2010.  as it was, it was merely a good album with some nice singles.  there may be a lyrical context to the way the album is presented, but it doesn't make sense sonically, and i think that's really all that should matter.  the story being told doesn't have to have a linear progression, and flash-backs and -forwards can always have great dramatic effect.    re-ordered album = 5 starts from me  because it didn't come like that = 4 stars...
0007270968|3.0|This is a quick and easy read written in an autobiographical format. Ramsay goes into some detail about his difficult youth, but runs pretty quickly through the years after, barely highlighting some of his career events. He barely, if at all, addresses his controversial nature, but you still walk away from this book knowing more about him than you did before you read it. There is reason to respect the man after you understand where he has come from, and how hard he has worked to get where he is. He is definitely a man of passion and vision. This book is not a complete and detailed retelling of Ramsay's lfe, but it helps fill in some of the gaps if you're Ramsay-curious.

B003L77G06|5.0|Like many second seasons of comedies, Modern Family fell short of the heights of its debut.  The nice thing is, the debut was so high, a short fall like this still results in really good comedy, with flashes of greatness.  The setting and characters of the show are the same as in Season One, nobody new is introduced and no one leaves.  That allows the characters to get comfortable with each other even more......too comfortable in some cases, though it's nothing too excessive.  The show's breakout character has clearly become Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell), the dippy father/husband/son-in-law who badly wants to do the right thing and be cool at the same time.  That doesn't often work, but Phil is so earnest in what he does that you just smile and want to pat him on the head.  Not sure if I would want him as a father, but he'd be the best uncle alive.  His wife Claire (Julie Bowen), is still wound tight during this season, and some her explosions are very, very funny.  Again, wouldn't want her as a mother......or an aunt.  She's funny to watch on TV though, and she and Burrell both deserved the Emmy's they got  for this season.  Their kids got a bit more to do, as Hailey (Sarah Hyland)had boy problems, as well as concerns about her future.......Alex (Ariel Winter) has to decide between being smart and being popular.....and Luke (Nolan Gould) seems destined to be his dad, they're so much alike it's scary.  The three Dunphy kids' storylines came at the expense of Manny (Rico Rodriguez), who had less to do this season unfortunately, though he and Jay (Ed O'Neill) still play off each other brilliantly.  In many ways this is the most interesting relationship in the show, Jay's third attempt at fatherhood, and his failures and successes with Manny don't go unnoticed  by his adult children, not always a good thing.  It leads to some interesting subtext in the relationships between Jay and his children, I hope they do more with it.  Gloria (Sofia Vergara) is a bit over the top thisseason, and her yelling could be used to torture prisoners, but Vergara successfully continues to steer Gloria away from the antagonist role that one would have assumed she'd have when the series started.  Mitchell and Cameron (Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Eric Stonestreet) are where the series has it's first real issues.  Cameron is becoming a bit much to deal with, with his over the top antics and \\"me, me, and more me\\" diva personality.  The character seems to have the need to take over any scene he's in, and he's a bit clueless to boot.  I'm not saying that he has an emotionally abusive relationship with Mitchell, but I can see a few ways it could be going there.  I'm sure it's the performance that the show runners want, given that it's not changed through the first four episodes of the current season, but the less Cameron the better. Ferguson's Mitchell is notable in that he has some nice, quiet moments during the season that really say a lot about him.....and a couple of loud ones too, the subplot where Jay has dinner with Mitchell and Cameron and their friends is terrific, and you can see Mitchell looking at his father like he doesn't really know who he is.  Also notable with these two characters is their daughter Lily, played by twins who never once, to my recollection, change their facial expression, no matter what the hijinks going on around them.  I found it fascinating, in a good way, and was disappointed to see the role recast for the current season.  Overall this is a great season, as the family continues it's issues, fun, and growth.  Outside characters are kept to a minimum, most are merely MacGuffins anyway, though there was some nice stunt casting at times.  Modern Family continues to hold a slim, but noticeable lead over Big Bang Theory as my favorite comedy, and I look forward to more adventures of the next months.  Five stars.
B005G4TJUC|3.0|I still think the first Transformers was the best of the series. I had high hopes that the third installment would have redeeming factors after the second was so lack luster, but I was sadly disappointed. Sam has no job and is being supported by his new hot girlfriend Carly, and that's about all she is - hot and pretty.  She really serves no other purpose in this movie.<br /><br />The Autobots have gone off in search of the Decepticons, but come back when they learn of a ship known as the Ark and its contents crashed on the moon after the Cybertron war back in the 60s.  This moon crash is revealed as being the main reason NASA went to the moon, but it was all covered up. The autobots go to the moon to bring back autobot Sentinel and some pillars that can be used to build a time space bridge for teleporting.<br /><br />The main problem with the movie is that there really isn't a clear sense of plot line going on here.  It's pieced together with too many other story lines that really serve no importance other than to add time to the three hour movie. Sam is jealous of his girlfriend's relationship with his boss. Sam is mad because he can't find a job.  Sam gets a medal from the president. Sam's parents come to visit. Shia LaBeouf also seemed to be adlibbing most of the time - his banter and screaming really gets on your nerves after a while.<br /><br />All havoc breaks loose when Sentinel is revived and begins setting up the bridge in favor of the Decepticons.  War breaks out, and you can pretty much guess how it all wraps up.  Not much has changed from the way the first two movies played out.<br /><br />For a three hour film, it took too long to really pick up and by then it was too late. It's pieced together with too many useless scenes that while you do walk away from the film with somewhat of a clear sense of what happened, most of it just wasn't clearly defined or was left up to the viewer to decipher what was going on.  There's also quite a bit of political agenda which stole away from the quality of the film, and let's not forget all the B movie actors. The end was predictable, and the special effect scenes are nothing glamorous that you haven't already seen in the first two films.<br /><br />Very disappointing overall, but most films are by the time they become a trilogy, right?y of the film, and let's not forget all the B movie actors. The end was predictable, and the special effect scenes are nothing glamorous that you haven't already seen in the first two films.  Very disappointing overall, but most films are by the time they become a trilogy, right?
B004EPYZU8|3.0|I can't quite put my finger on what's wrong with this film. The concept is good if not particularly new (see any Gilliam film). The costumes are great. The sets are great. The music is good. I think I just never felt any connection with the central character. She was always numb and, as a result perhaps, I was pretty numb to her plight. The story nested us into the various imaginary scenes very well (ala Inception) so that was easy to follow. The visual cues at the start told us too much perhaps. Maybe the battle scenes dragged on a little longer than needed. Whatever it was, I felt the film lacked the tension it should have had. ...Maybe it's better seen in 3D.
B004GHBQCE|5.0|This CD is wonderful. So heartfelt. If your kids are into today's music, this would be a good transition CD to give them a taste of OLD country- introducing them in a \\"cool\\" way to Johnny Cash and maybe influencing their taste of music. The real reason I wrote this review is because it needs LOTS more 5 star reviews and that one 1 star review is totally bunk.
4770031246|5.0|So happy that I bought this Bento Cookbook. I was looking for something that had authentic Japanese recipes and not just things that looked \\"cute\\" in a bento (although some things in this book are quite cute). The recipes are very simple and fun to cook. It also offers many alternatives to every recipe. Definitely a must have if you're interested in cooking Japanese food. It also includes some not-so-Japanese recipes as well. Very awesome book. I could not be happier with my purchase :D
B0051QO4QY|5.0|How else can i say this.... Lady Gaga ROCKS!!! Her music inspires so many people! This is the best CD ever! I have not taken it out of my cd player in my car since i bought it the day it was released!
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Build Quality(7.5/10) - These headphones are built quite nicely and feel very sturdy. However, I can't resist mentioning that they look a little cheap and plasticky (compared to the AKGs that they reflect). Looks aside, they feel very solid, the earcups swivel a little vertically to adjust to your head but they don't feel flimsy. The slidewire headband works very well. One thing that I always like to note is the quality of the wire. The wire on the HD681 is fantastic, nice and thick and flexible at the same time (quite unlike the thin rubbery wire of the Sennheiser HD428 that I also reviewed).  Comfort(6/10) - I must admit that I am a bit disappointed by the comfort of these headphones, but take what I say with a grain of salt. I have a relatively large head and ears so when I first got this pair of headphones I found the clamp force to be a bit too much. I loosened the headphones over a stack of books which helped a little but I cannot wear them for prolonged periods without feeling discomfort. This is also my first experience with circular earpads which I find very nice because my ears fit comfortable inside. However, the padding on the earpads are very hard and not the most comfortable at all. However, many of you may find your case to be different.  Isolation(5/10) - Not fantastic considering that they are semi-open headphones. However, their very forward sound kind of makes up a little for the lack of isolation. Of course like all other semi-open and open headphones, this is not a pair of headphones you want to wear in a place like the library.  Sound(6.75/10) - When I first got these, I thought that they were fantastic but after a few weeks of listening, I'm having a few second thoughts.   The main problem that I'm having is that the highs, while clear and relatively crisp, are a bit too forward on some notes for my taste to the point where I almost wince a little when I listen to them now (granted I have been spoiled by my TF10s). High notes can almost a little shrill. The mids on the other hand are good, they are present but do not quite have the sweetness and smoothness of some other headphones. While it is crisp, it doesn't feel quite as warm as I would like it to be. The strength of this headphone easily comes from its bass, which is quite boomy. I find the bass quite fun, it has good depth and has a good bit of kick to it.   The soundstage is a tad lacking in my opinion, a little more depth would be nice. Overall though, the sound is relatively wide and open sounding. The sound is pretty forward and direct, definitely a fun sound.  Value and Opinion(8.25/10) (Current price ~ $35-40) - These headphones are nice, they really are. They have great sound and are an amazing value. But a few small things prevent me from loving it. For me, the clamp force is too large. However, this can be remedied by stretching it over some books. My main problem is the overly forward highs which I find to be a bit shrill and even fatiguing at times. But if you are looking for a bit more bass with some good kick, good clarity, and a fun sound signature, the HD681 is a fantastic pair of cans. And personally, I love the intense look.
0061537969|5.0|My friend suggested that I read this book after my dog died. I was heartbroken and this book really helped to ease the pain. The way the dog (Enzo) is portrayed and given human qualities is really great. It's such a good book that I read it in two days - I couldn't put it down. Although it's a tearjerker, I'd recommend this book to dog lovers. It's definitely worth the read.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|is reason enough to spend the money on this one.  On track 6, that cat Joe Bonamassa does this 2.5 minute epic guitar solo.  It starts at about 3:45 and ends at 6:20.  Oh man, this is one to floor people.  I pop it in a few months later and still can't believe my ears, some serious melodic guitar feat.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Its always different and keeps me actively thinking. Even if this wasnt the FAOTD last a couple weeks ago I would still pay $1 for it in a heartbeat! Runs smooth, fantastic gfx, and their social system is sooo much better and simpler than Feint! -Evo 3D
B000056HOZ|5.0|I would like to recommend this video for any Springsteen fan. A great range of songs highligthed with wife and band members singing \\"If I should fall behind\\". Awesome!
1423140591|5.0|If you've enjoyed the first series Rick Riordan wrote, and have also liked the first Heroes of Olympus book, this will not disappoint.  I would strongly recommend that someone NOT start with this series, though, if they haven't first read the Percy Jackson series, it's simply too hard to make sense of this one otherwise.  Also, I saw someone else talking about typos, and I have to say I was surprised how many typos there were in my hardcover edition.  Let's hope someone fixes this before the next print run.  Also have to say, the egyptian series with the Kane siblings is simply not as good as either of these series.
B005K2KCPG|5.0|I liked the first album, but this one is a huge step forward.  The difference is that  the first album sounded like four highly capable musicians brought together to play some decent songs, while this album sounds like a veteran band that has learned to write music and play together in a way that truly maximizes everyone's strengths.  The songs are great - melodic, with choruses and hooks that will stick in your mind long after you're done listening.  All four members shine (as you would expect, the musicianship is fantastic), but no one tries to dominate and the songs take center stage.
B004SUDPWI|4.0|Arrived quickly and great packaging. I am in the process of replacing all my VHS tapes and going digital. I think the disc format is the best.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This is a very useful app, it's like having a USB cable you can pull out of your phone.  So if you want to grab some file from someone, or share some file with someone, you can just fire up this app.    I don't get the security complaints.  You don't run this on an ongoing basis, just when you want to share a file.  It is clear when it's active, there is an icon in the status bar.  And it only serves up your SD card, not the entire file system.  If it were all locked down by default, it would be irritating to use.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This is the best adaptation I have seen.  The casting for Jane and for Mr. Rochester were perfect.  The movie did a good job bringing out the emotional connection between the characters, although a bit more interaction between the two before the first fire would have been helpful, but what are you going to do in two hours!  And I wish a few of the deleted scenes had actually made it into the movie to explain more.  But I was delighted with what did make it into the movie and how well it was done.
B005OYKI1I|1.0|should've saved my five bucks and rented transformers. what a stupid, stupid movie. i expected stupid, but i really expected a little more entertainment. boring and retarded.

0525423281|4.0|Positive: Lola and her family. The dynamic between Lola and her dads is fabulous (yes, Lola has two dads) -- they love each other, they argue with each other, they're integral in each others' lives. As it should be. Now, Lola's birth mother? That's a whole other story, one that gums up Lola's relatively happy family but she adds depth and layers.<br /><br />Positive: Love. Of course, this is a romance so it's all about love. But Lola's got a boyfriend, Max, when Cricket, Lola's first love, comes back into town. Will Lola stick with Max, her awesome rockin' boyfriend? Or is her first love her true love?<br /><br />Positive??: The outfits. They were cute but sooo over-the-top. Lola seriously had some guts to wear those things out of the house, not to mention school. Yes, I have question marks beside that positive because I'm not sure it was necessary to make Lola that costume-crazy. But it was cool.<br /><br />Wish: That the perfect ending hadn't been so...perfect. Again, this is a romance so there's only one way it's supposed to end but it was a tad bit too pat, too everything-falling-into-place.<br /><br />Overall: Perkins certainly knows how to tell a great love story, one that will have her readers cheering for Lola and lusting for a Cricket of their own (he's such a cutie-patootie, isn't he?).
B004SBQGHS|2.0|The most overate game. There's too much chance, poor controls, and sloppy play.  Here are the extra words for the rest of the review.
0425241505|5.0|Holy cow! This book is filled with such steamy goodness and testosterone, I almost passed out while reading it. I have my new book boyfriend: I'm in love with Dragos, the most alpha of alpha males and super-hot dragon man. Would that I were Pia. Unfortunately, I'm afraid I'm going to have to have a smackdown with Jenny of Supernatural Snark over Dragos. She did recommend this series to me, after all. Does she have prior claim, then? Hum, I think not.<br /><br />DRAGON BOUND takes off with a bang -- Pia's stolen something from the scariest creature on Earth and is on the run for her life. Dragos is determined to use any means possible to track the thief down and punish her. There's some serious mystery surrounding Pia, one that intrigues Dragos to no end and, once he has her within his grip, he's reluctant to let her go.<br /><br />I can't rave about this book enough. All of the characters are fabulous -- even the secondary characters are amazing. The world Pia and Dragos live in is intricate and incredibly well-crafted. While Pia seems like a bit of a wimp and a little \\"oh, poor little me\\" at first, by the middle of the book, she shows that she actually a spine of steel hiding under all that fluff. And Dragos. Oh, my heart be still. He's one awesome alpha male. *drool* (again) I want more like him. More, more, more!<br /><br />So...I immediately downloaded the next book in the Elder series to my Kindle and dove right in!
B00005JM20|5.0|I know that British humor is not for everyone. But for me and my family, this bloody-brilliant comedy transcends the big pond, and age groups. It is one of the few DVD's we have viewed repeatedly over the past several years, each time with big laughs.<br /><br />Rowan Atkinson is simply one of the most masterful comedy actors of our generation. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys clean, clever, silly, endearing, funny comedies. If you do not know how to laugh, or require crudeness or raunch to enjoy a film, this may not be for you. But probably is if you would give it a chance.
B004ZNA5JO|5.0|The album that causes the most devisiveness among Floyd fans.  There are plenty of anlayses in the other reviews regarding the merits of this record.  Suffice it to say that, yes, David gilmour has committed a few musical crimes on this album.  But he's also created some brilliant moments as well, and this is quite a worthy album, whether you want to listen to it as a genuine Pink Floyd album or as a glorified solo effort.  (And I would say that this album is less of a solo effort than \\"The Final Cut\\" was).<br /><br />I mostly want to concentrate on the remaster here.  I have owned every version of this CD, starting with its release in 1987.  In fact, this was one of the first CDs I ever owned.  But I think it took a while for producers and engineers to really learn how to use the digital medium, as this record (and others recorded in this era) have always sounded a bit \\"thin\\" and compressed to my ear.  With this new remaster, they finally got it right.  Now there's definitely an element of \\"loudness\\" to this particular remaster -- more so than the other albums in this 2011 batch.  But that's because there are songs on this album that NEED to be loud...specifically \\"Learning to Fly,\\" \\"One Slip,\\" \\"On The Turning Away\\" and \\"Sorrow.\\"  And it's here that I hear the most improvement, not just in the volume, but in a wider stereo mix, with a more pronounced, defined bottom end.  In short, it sound as if the engineers FINALLY learned how to mix for the digital medium.<br /><br />In fact, the only real flaws I hear are the dated 80s drums, with the snare that echoes forever.  But remastering won't fix that.  All in all, better results than I expected, given the relative recent recording of this album.  Improvements are definitely on par with most of the other records in this set of remasters, so if you were happy with the results on \\"Animals\\" and \\"Meddle,\\" and if you liked this record in the first place, then this purchase should be a no-brainer.
B0025YKDJC|5.0|Wonderful movie, my boyfriend and I laughed all the way through it. Its got a lot for everyone (save maybe not the kiddies till they are older) but I loved it. Normally, Jim Carey's over the top humor is a bit too much for me, but it fit this movie really well. You need to go over the top when you've been stifling yourself your whole life. and Zooey Dechanel was spot on when she said \\"We know it as kids, but we forget\\" Zooey and Jim have great chemistry in this movie =) I would rank this as one of my favorites, along with Stranger Than Fiction. A must see for anyone whos tired of life slipping by them.
B005BGBPBG|1.0|We watched this on the plane and while I'm a big fan of Krasinki from The Office, this movie was terrible. It had horrible dialogue and the storyline is uninspired. Would you ever cheat on your best friend? It left a bad taste in my mouth.
B005I6HYPA|4.0|This is Jane Austen's first published novel though not as well known as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Emma\\", it is still an ageless classic.  Written in the English of the early 18th century it is at the same time almost poetic and difficult to comprehend, which can cause the younger reader to find it stilted or boring.  In Austen's writing you must often times read between the lines, as in that period of time many things could not be openly expressed but only hinted at, so take your time.  All her books relate to the reader lessons to be learned from life and the character of persons one might meet or associate with. This copy is beautifully formated by VOOK for navigation throughout the book, punctuation,  and ease in reading unlike most of the poorly scaned copies of the classics that are available.  Northanger Abbey also has a few nice picture illustrations.
1439102724|1.0|Are you as tired as I am of books and TV shows being less about stories and more about political agenda? If so, don't read this book. When Zoe asks her mom if she will disown her for being a lesbian, mom answers: Of course not, you're gay not Republican!   In case the 50% of the country who are not against Republican views don't get the message that they are the bad guys, our heroine's ex, a born again Christian, is now part of anti-gay \\"hate filled\\" demonstrations. Of course the book makes clear that if you are against gay marriage you must automatically hate gays. After all, as we all know, (tongue in cheek), those who say that gays should have civil unions rather than marriage, are the same as those many many people who say \\"Save a deer kill a queer\\" (another great message sent to us from this \\"open, tolerant\\", author) And the most passionate love scenes can only be between 2 women... (no man needed for passion here anywhere-he's just the guy who shoots syringes in his wife's butt for in-vitro efforts.)   I JUST WANT A STORY! I don't want your heavy handed biased politics!! Jodi, dear author,I am a Republican and one of many readers you are likely to turn off, because you make my views so stereotypical and evil, and it gets old!! If only you could tolerate religion and Republicans as you do gay lifestyles and marriage, this story might have a chance, but if you can't, please don't pretend this is just an entertaining novel. The political message is like a jackhammer. Your characters say that they can respect other people's religion so long as it is not forced upon others- I say the same to you about your political views. Don't shove them down my throat- don't make your views heroic and others hate-filled and evil Show half the tolerance in your writing that you admonish those terrible Republican Christians for not having.
0385344325|2.0|This story goes back to Major Reacher's beginnings before he left the Army and became a lone civilian tough guy righting wrongs. The narrative is crisp but the plot is vague and studded with poorly handled sex scenes. The conclusion is unrealisic. I can see no good reason for this novel except to provide a prequel to the Reahcer series but is does not do that well  I shall be wary of buying any more in the series in case they are similar
B000VDUWMC|3.0|Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel is  a great work; Diamond  successfully introduces and melds numerous disparate sources to explain the predominance of Western states over aboriginal cultures. However, the work is greatly flawed at the same time-- it misrepresents the achievements of other states, such as the Ottomans, whose achievements would run counter to his thesis. For the Ottomans had superior guns (they hammered Constantinople into submission prior to widespread European use of cannon), germs (or, actually resistance to same; the Ottomans had a smallpox vaccine well before Europe) and steel (Damascene). Diamond uncharacteristically provides no scholastic support for his brief synopsis of the Ottoman's fate, \\" They committed ecological suicide by destroying their own resource base\\" (Epilogue, p. 411 of the Norton paperback edition). There are numerous current works on the Ottoman's and their position relative to the Western states, ecological suicide is not considered a relevant factor. In short, Diamond's central thesis is flawed, based on his reasoning, we should all be subjects of the Sultan. However, I would still strongly recommend this book, both for it's collection of source materials and Diamond's skill at producing a readable product as well as it's place as another example of environmental determinism, a philosophy unique to the last few centuries (think Malthus).
0312370849|4.0|Novels about the Holocaust are so painful to read that some people skip them.  This one, however, although it conveys the pain of the victims, has a terrific plot.  This is a story that should be told again and again, and the plot encourages this.
B0053Q9DHW|2.0|I have to admit, I was very disappointed in this version.  I love the book and have watched most of the movie versions from the last 20 years or more and was so looking forward to this one.  Unfortunately, it does not follow the story as accurately as the Timothy Dalton version and is so disjointed and anti-climactic that is was not really enjoyable for me.  I don't think you can follow the story from this movie unless you have read the book and if you have read the book you will probably not feel that it does justice to the story.
1594744769|5.0|I thought the book sounded intriguing--a unique premise and I wasn't disappointed. A thoughtful story full of interesting characters and clever ideas. At heart, this is a sort-of coming of age story, with a few twists! Loved the writing, the concept of the home, the bird named ladies and their charges as well as the parallel stories between now and then. Kind of a giant deja vu. Read this short novel! Enjoyed the odd photos, which the author and friends have collected over the years. No real surprise in the ending, for adults or children, but one you root for anyway. I highly recommend [[ASIN:1594744769 Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]] or in Kindle format [[ASIN:B004FGMDOQ Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]]. Doesn't matter which format you select, just read this heart warming story then pass it on to a favored teen or pre-teen to enjoy...then discuss! Might just open some doors for you...
B003L77GG0|5.0|I discovered Smallville in its 3rd season. I could not wait to go back and see the first 2 seasons. It has been my favorite show of all time. The writers have done a good job with keeping the story going and not bringing things out too quickly. I have all 9 seasons and can not wait to get that final season. The one and only flaw of the whole series is when they killed off Jimmy olsen at the end of season 8. Other than that, the whole series is great. I really loved the way they wrapped everything up in the final episode and finally all the superman elements were there.(Except JImmy Olsen)I will really miss not having a new episode to watch every week, but I guess all good things must come to an end. I will enjoy watching them on DVD.
B0000024TT|5.0|I rate this as the best lyrical album i've ever heard. Besides that the melodies are wonderful as well as the minimal accompanying music and John Simon's production is fantastic. This is simply one of the best albums I've listened to particularly for those times when you want to be moved and intrigued and involved with the artist.

1400052173|5.0|A fascinating and horrifying read about an African-American woman whose cells were replicated in the pursuit of medical research.  Her cells have been instrumental in helping researchers understand many diseases and find many cures but the way she and her family were treated was unjust. An excellent medically-based biography that reveals yet another area in which African-Americans were treated badly.
1593272839|4.0|This book does what its handful of competitors could not do: it made an advanced language easy to learn.  Lipovaca has taken the time to break Haskell's heady ideas down into small steps, and he has had the patience to accompany each of those steps with liberal doses of friendly and engaging prose. If the prose is occasionally *too* friendly and engaging, then he has erred on the right side of caution, as other authors have not.  Fans of the book's forerunning website will recognize Lipovaca's brand of humor as well as his cute pictures, qualities that serve well his purpose of keeping a difficult subject down to earth and downright fun.  I give it four stars because I am persnickety about a few points of prose style and not because, say, the book lacks exercises, which is hardly a fault in light of the abundance of its examples.  All in all, this text is a salvation, and it may even become a classic.
B003L77GGK|5.0|The seasons keep getting better, this one was fun to watch with a good story line.  It's great to see the entire production understanding what they are doing and with episodes like \\"The French Mistake\\" show they are still connected with the viewers.
160788657X|5.0|I became a big fan of David Baldacci after listening to \\"Camel Club\\". Following a back surgery I need to walk as exercise, and a good audio book makes me want to do my exercises. This book did a splendid job at that - it made me want to keep walking and finding out the rest of the story. I like Baldacci's style of writing and the gripping story line.<br /><br />\\"Hell's corner\\" is the fifth book (published in 2010) in Camel Club series. The plot revolves around Oliver Stone solving a mysterious explosion in a park across the street from the White House. Solving this mystery took more twists and turns and surprises than any of the previous Oliver Stone stories and I really enjoyed it.  I like the character of Oliver Stone because is an older guy, not just a young hot shot. Baldacci also creates strong female characters that can fend for themselves.  I can relate to the characters and want to learn more about them.  Even though each book in Oliver Stone series can be read without reading the previous ones, the author does make some references to events in the previous book with a quick summary.  I think the story is more enjoyable and the characters are move developed if you read the series in the order in which it was written.  For my own reference I created a list of all Baldacci books by publication year, as well as by series.  I hope someone will find it useful as well.<br /><br />David Baldacci book by publication year<br />Absolute Power (1996)<br />Total Control (1996)<br />Winner, the (1997)<br />Saving Faith (1999)<br />Simple Truth, the (1999)<br />Wish You Well (2000)<br />Last Man Standing (2002)<br />Christmas Train, the (2002)<br />Split Second (2003) King&Maxwell series<br />Hour Game (2004) King&Maxwell series<br />Camel Club, the (2005) Camel Club series<br />Fries Alive!

B003Y5H5JM|5.0|Prospera, once the Duke of Milan and sorceress now reigns over a faraway island, living there with her daughter, Miranda. After 12 years of being abandoned she has an opportunity for revenge. However the ships may bring more than she planned on.<br /><br />It is impossible to have lived in the cinematic world and not come across any the other productions by Julie Taymor. With each of her productions she does not copy but enhances the originals in a unique way. In this case we have quite a few deviations. However as long as you are aware of the original play you can appreciate the deviations. Prospero is replaced by Prospera (Helen Mirren) one of the greatest actresses of our time. Julie's approach is different but does not go off the deep end and re-create a whole new story; as the story is just enhanced by dynamic technology and cinematic capabilities not available in earlier productions. And naturally a mother daughter story will have some different outlook than a father daughter story.<br /><br />The only drawback is the curt runtime forcing some reduction in dialog and addition of references.<br /><br />Added plusses of course first include Helen Mirren. Also the location (various untraded locations in Hawaii) is perfect. The underwater or through water scenes gave an ethereal feel.

B0044FC06Y|5.0|I have read many other Ken Follett books, most notably Eye of the Needle (his first) and Pillars of the Earth and World Without End.  His writing is very easy to follow without being simplistic; his characters are interesting, varied, and with so much personality that you don't form the expected sympathies (e.g., English over the Germans); thus you can feel sympathy and have support for some Germans and dislike some of the English.  This type of relationship with the characters is one reason why I love Follett's books; no character or group of people is strictly evil or good; most are both, just some are more evil than good and vice versa.  I also learn from his novels.  Although reading nonfiction history of this era is the best way to learn about this period of the 20th century, reading historical novels such as Fall of Giants or watching silent movies from this time period (e.g., soviet propaganda films by Eisenstein) is very enjoyable and you can still learn something from them.  The biggest impact is to see in retrospect that the Soviet Union would stay as a \\"communist\\" country for only another 70 years or so; maybe if it had not been run by a series of dictators, rather than by the majority of working people, it could have lasted longer, but we will never know; right now it seems a mixture of government styles, trying to have an open economy but it seems still to be a dictatorship.  Frankly however, no matter how horrible the Soviet dictatorships were in the 20th century (e.g., Stalin), it was not as bad as being under the rule of the inbred, stupid Romanovs or other Russian aristocrats with their extreme class system.

B005D0TETA|2.0|I love this concert. That's why it hurts giving it only 2 stars for the bluray version.  I agree with another reviewer about the animation on Gates of Delirium which is also my favorite cut.  The forced animation absolutely ruins it.  All I can think is that this was a mistake. The regular DVD version has a bypass option so why is there not one on the bluray?  I rewatched the standard DVD and it really only has marginally less picture quality than the bluray and the audio is completely acceptible.  I find it hard to believe anyone would actually like the animation so my advice to anyone that is considering the bluray, forget it and get the regular DVD.  Maybe someday they will realize their mistake and reissue the bluray with the bypass option.

0199235694|4.0|The subject of this book is Japan during the 150 years or so from the 1853 visit of the American \\"black ships\\" to the early 21st century. The book's strength is in describing a couple of narrow aspects of this period: the major events in Japan's political history, and the dominant theories of Japanese nationalism. It neither is effective, nor seems to be intended, as a book describing contemporary Japanese culture, society or even domestic politics. So if you're mostly interested in manga and anime, or are anticipating your first visit to Tokyo, this book will probably disappoint you -- unless a visit to Yasukuni Shrine will be the highlight of your trip.  The book is most solid when reviewing the major events and figures in Japanese political history from the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate to the to the 1960s or so. The author (CGJ) shows that contrary to the popular image, Japan wasn't entirely closed to the West prior the the Black Ships' visit. He also describes how samurai from the Satsuma and Choushuu regions were to play important roles into the early 20th Century, though the book fails to include maps with these and other older place names, which may confuse some readers. Unfortunately, no light is shed on the role of the Shouwa emperor (a/k/a \\"Emperor Hirohito,\\" though he was never known as such in Japan) in the lead-up to WWII; but events of the post-WWII occupation, including the rise of Communist and Socialist parties, are covered fairly well. CGJ emphasizes the importance of the Korean War for igniting Japan's economic boom, a fact often overlooked. Once past the mid 1960s, though, a few decades' worth of prime ministers are mostly ignored until Koizumi Jun'ichirou (2002-2006), despite the importance of some of them, especially Tanaka Kakue, the most powerful politician in Japan during the 1970s and much of the '80s.   Another area in which the book does relatively well is in describing various Japanese thinkers' theories of nationalism and \\"Japanese-ness\\" (a genre known as \\"nihonjinron\\"). This is a somewhat academic topic, however, based on the published writings of a handful of authors. Little or nothing is said in the book about how ordinary Japanese view themselves, or about their political attitudes.   More attention to popular sentiment might have kept the author off some thin ice, such as when he discusses Japan's apologies for its wartime actions (Chap. 5). He points out that Japan has apologized officially numerous times, but that its Asian neighbors don't believe it is sincere. A narrative of wartime victimhood that's become prominent in Japan may justify some of those doubts, and CGJ questions whether a country may be said to have the same psychological traumas as an individual. And yet he commits the same fallacy of personification when he refers to \\"Japan's reluctance to formally acknowledge (or pay reparations to) the so-called 'comfort women',\\" i.e. Korean, Chinese and other sex slaves of the Imperial Army (@136). Who is \\"Japan\\" here? If it's the Japanese government and some scholars, his statement may be fair enough. But CGJ never mentions that many thousands of *individual* Japanese don't have any difficulty in acknowledging these misdeeds, and in reaching out to Koreans and others through friendship organizations to express regret.  Given the strong political emphasis in this history, I'd have liked to have seen some mention of actual political life and the deficits in democracy that persist today. These include, e.g. the extreme conservatism of the Supreme Court, restrictions on free speech and a free press, the tendency for seats in the Diet to become de facto hereditary, and Japanese voters' frustration with their system. Nonetheless, since there are limits to how much can be stuffed into a VSI, even one as generous as this (about 150 pages of text), it would be ungenerous to call these sins of omission.  Unfortunately, though, the book's sins of commission are too frequent to ignore. It's simply not so reliable as to cultural and social matters. A sampling: CGJ refers to kabuki theater \\"serving a double function as the home of actresses qua courtesans\\" during the 18th Century (@32), but actresses participated in kabuki only between 1603 and 1629, when they were banned; thereafter all female roles were (and are today) played by men. He refers to the \\"new species\\" generation (shin jinrui) as choosing the \\"furiita\\" (freelance work) lifestyle instead of lifetime employment (@117), but the furiita phenomenon involved people at least 10 years younger than the \\"new species,\\" and today is not a free choice but imposed on many young people. (The fiction of furiita continuing to be a lifestyle choice is a favorite trope of free market advocates in Japan.) CGJ's use of the term \\"moga\\" (from \\"modern girl\\") to refer to a women's \\"movement\\" in the 1980s and 1990s is entirely anachronistic (@118); the term belongs to the inter-war period of the early Shouwa. The June 2008 stabbings in Akihabara were not an outgrowth of \\"otaku\\" (geek) culture, as CGJ says @147; while it is true that Akihabara is famous for its otaku, on the weekend of the incident it was crowded with shoppers of all types, and the perpetrator was actually a temporary auto worker who was angered by his belief he was going to be fired from his job.   Much else about contemporary Japanese society in the book seems to have been sourced from Western media. The only fiction authors discussed in any detail are the \\"literary\\" ones who've been translated into English: mainly Murakami (Haruki, not Ryu), Yoshimoto Banana, Mishima, and Kawabata. Themes from manga, anime, recent films and popular genre fiction might have provided material for social insight, but, other than the obligatory scholarly mention of Godzilla, these are ignored. Murakami Haruki is made to seem like a seer for his diagnosis of the spiritual and existential anomie of Japanese youth, yet very down-to-earth causes of their alienation arenever mentioned, such as the growth of economic inequality, and the Koizumi-era Labor Law revisions that helped make folks like the Akihabara killer members of the \\"precariate\\". Sensational and exceptional phenomena that got a lot of press in the West, such as enjo kousai (compensated dating) and a 14-year-old's decapitation of an 11-year-old in 1997, are made to appear widespread or symptomatic of the country's predicament. In fact, though, decapitations by or of children and similar spectacular mayhem did not become significantly more common in the 12 years between that incident and the book's publication. Japan's low crime rate? You won't read about it here.  Finally, the book's attempts at synthesis are often far less substantial than they seem at first glance. At the end of the next-to-last chapter, CGJ observes (and not in the context of immigration, BTW): \\"Unlike the USA, which has managed to attract people from all over the world to its brand of the 'American dream', Japan has yet to offer a vision of itself that attracts others to it\\" (@139). Why does Japan *need* such a vision? What is the corresponding \\"vision\\" of the UK, or of Germany, say? This \\"big question\\" rests on a dubious premise, and illustrates how the book is weakest when it strays from potted history. The book's conclusion itself is just empty padding:  \\"Like many other such societies at the start of the 21st century, a pressing question for Japan is what happens after modernity, and what will be Japan's role in finding out.\\" Come on, is it really profound to ask what will be your role in finding out what the rest of your life will be like?  CGJ also misses the opportunity to connect his good observation about the division between power and authority at the end of the Warriors' Era (before 1600, when warlords had power and the emperor had authority) to the parliamentary situation today (when sitting Prime Ministers have authority, but former ones, and other \\"shadow shoguns\\" like Ozawa Ichiro,have power).  Best I can say, in sum: 3.5 or so stars' worth of good, concise background from a \\"top-down\\" perspective about modern Japanese political history and its interpretation by some intellectuals -- but not really about modern Japan.
0385534639|3.0|Magic, illusions, physical and mind tricks but more than trickery, truth. I truly did enjoy reading \\"The Night Circus\\", by Erin Morgenstern - it is so the genre I'm drawn to. The premise is magnificently novel, the characters weave intricately, and nicely, and some are so endearing. The prose, it's delightfully poetic. The author is descriptive in the extreme, which I liked, and exact in her writing; I enjoyed it, I did. However, like that which holds together \\"The Night Circus\\" itself, the story lacks substance. Not that there isn't the basis for it. There was much opportunity to draw the characters out further as Ms. Morgenstern has a terrific story but she fails to deliver it with pizazz. The premise is wickedly extravagant but there might have been more depth to the relationships; but poof!
0887081770|1.0|I was expecting a hard cover, large book like one you would find at the library... Instead it is about 6 inches tall and 5 inches wide board book (some pages extends a small amount) and it looks nothing like the book I checked out at the library that my 2 year old adored.  I think the product should include this information so customers are not misled. The book I wanted has extendable ladders when \\"papa\\" gets the moon, and this book doesn't include this.  I am very disappointed.

B00536OCZA|1.0|Ranks as one of noisiest new vinyl records I have ever purchased.  Obvious physical imperfections like fingerprints, scuffs, etc.  I returned that copy.  My 2nd copy had much less of the aforementioned, but still had a nasty tick once every revolution on Us and Them.  That defect is in the pressing.  Other audible ticks and pops as well.  Terrible job.  Guess I won't be buying Wish You Were Here and The Wall when they are released.  What company pressed this?  I cleaned this record using a VPI 16.5 wet-vacuum cleaning machine with L'Art du Son cleaning fluid.  It was played back on a VPI Scout turntable.

0385344325|5.0|I've read all the prior Reachers and loved them.  This book is terrific for two reasons:  first, it works for long-time fans and second, it is fine as a stand-alone introduction for first-timers.  For those in the second category, you have many wonderful reads ahead of you.  For fans, this book fills in a few blanks in Reacher's past but in such a smooth way that you realize it just after the action takes place.  As always, the book really moves and is hard to put down.  Supporting characters are well-drawn and the book is drenched in atmosphere - whether it is the Pentagon or the Deep South.  Reacher's deductions and fight scenes are excellent and he is less of an automaton here than he seems to be in some of the later books.  The point of view works well, although I must admit that the \\"voice\\" referring to \\"those times\\" became irritating pretty quickly.    Still, highly recommended.
0321701763|5.0|this book is good for real beginners, it's a good book to know your way around photoshop and how to use their tools. it's a good place to start. It also gives sample images you can practice on. good enough.
1579128149|5.0|This book fulfills about half of my wishes. There are photos for most of the elements up to around the 80s-where there are basically no pictures of the element itself :( For some there is a photo of something that i'm guessing might resemble said element. There are many strange and even amazing historical facts hinted at here; and this is a GREAT book for anyone with a beginning interest in the elements. I think even chemists and physicists would find out some things of interest here-at least enough to know where to research later    i had originally given a 4 star review but changed it to a 5.  i dont think this book should be given a lower score simply because im ticked off that pictures cant be found for most of the elements :)
B001AQMBHI|5.0|This was a great horror flick to me. It makes you imagine real life possibilties of prompted fatal circumstances brought on by a pattern forced by fate. A classic that had many great actors known today as stars & spawned a series of sequels. It was a must have for Blue Ray...wonderful quality.
B004EPZ00W|5.0|Michael Lewis's book, Moneyball, is a fascinating depiction of the insertion of statistics into baseball, melding the worlds of brains and brawn into a hard-to-stop whole. The film version does this  wonderful  book justice.<br /><br />Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, a once-promising baseball star whose career never took off. In 2002, he is general managing the Oakland A's, but with a budget that is a fraction of that of other ball teams. With the help of an economics major, he starts to put into  practice the arcane science of sabermetrics, hoping to find hidden ball-playing gems that can be obtaining or a song.<br /><br />The casting and storytelling were nearly perfect. Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane with a desperate charm. Jonah Hill plays the inexperienced Econ grad who applies numerical analysis to the game. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays irascible A's manager Art Howe, who wants to manage his players the old-fashioned way. I was pleased that the film gave a nod to the brains behind the statistics, Bill James, whose groundbreaking, obsessive and counterintuitive work laid the ground work for the scientific study of baseball.<br /><br />This is not a feel-good baseball movies where a fractious bunch of losers becomes superstars and win the Big Game. There's more subtlety at play. Big Money, family ties, love of the game and a desire to right old wrongs interweave throughout the plot to make Moneyball more complex than a simple moral tale. A fine film that does justice to the book on which it is based.
0307477479|5.0|If you've ever felt a little bit lost and wondered where life will take you, Jennifer Egan's A Visit From The Goon Squad is worth a read.<br /><br />A kleptomaniac, a burnt out record producer and a group of teens discovering sex, drugs and rock n' roll are just a few of the eclectic mix of characters in this award-winning book.<br /><br />A Visit From The Goon Squad is their coming of age.<br /><br />Egan writes with wit, care and humour in this interconnected collection of short stories.<br /><br />She creates a tapestry of characters whose lives evolve and intersect as their stories progress.<br /><br />A Visit From the Goon Squad visits each character at key turning points in their lives. It explores how we get from A to B, what can happen when life takes a detour and the impact of the passage of time.<br /><br />As you move from chapter to chapter, pay close attention to the minor characters and names that are mentioned in passing. Chances are they will turn up in a major role later on.<br /><br />It's fun trying to pick the potential comebacks and discovering what has transpired between one story and the next.<br /><br />Also, look out for the chapter told entirely in Powerpoint slides - surprisingly, this was my favourite chapter in the book (if only all Powerpoint presentations could be so engaging).<br /><br />A Visit From The Goon Squad is the recent winner of the 2011 Pulitzer Prize For Fiction and the 2011 National Book Critics Award.<br /><br />You can read more of my book recommendations at [...]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307477479 A Visit from the Goon Squad]]

B002T9H2MO|4.0|I saw this movie a few days ago, and find myself still thinking about it. That raised it from three stars to four in my book.  Sam Rockwell's performance was terrific, the setting was good (although I'm not sure anyone has surpassed Alien (1979) for the look and feel of a lived-in space setting), and the end wrapped things elegantly.<br /><br />What kept this from being five stars for me--and is actually why I keep thinking about it--are the fundamental plot problems, but thinking about the solutions is what's fascinating. The main one being that there's really no reason at all for setting up the station as a one-man operation, and plenty of really good reasons why you wouldn't make it a one-person operation (especially given the technology they had at their disposal).<br /><br />The other thing keeping this from five stars (for me) was the poor definition of the AI voiced by Kevin Spacey. HAL in 2001 was a brilliantly realized, conflicted character...Gerty felt more like a confused character, deflecting sometimes, helping at others, but I never had a good feeling for why Gerty's internal conflicts were inspiring the actions they did.<br /><br />Even with its flaws, though, this is an intriguing film worth watching and worth thinking about afterwards.

B0037XPP84|1.0|This dreadful movie is typical of Hollywood's biased version of History. This film takes extraordinary license with the facts of History and twists them to create a biased farce. The Spanish Ambassador looked more like an Arab than a real Spaniard; however, this does not surprise me as Hollywood always stereotypes Spaniards with a dark Arab or an indigenous Mexican template. Moreover, the absurd portrayal of King Philip II was that of a Darth Vader character saturated in his evil plans.<br /><br />The propagandistic English historical establishment is the best in the world at manipulation via mindless entertainment, discrediting other nations, diminishing the history of others while inflating their own, and distorting Historical facts. They, along with the Dutch (research the Paper Wars against Spain in the 16th century) have been masters at the art of deception and propaganda for more than 500 years.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0822302500 The Black Legend in England;: The development of anti-Spanish sentiment, 1558-1660 (Duke historical publications)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:082634576X Tree of Hate: Propaganda and Prejudices Affecting United States Relations with the Hispanic World]]
B005NA3B8U|3.0|This review is based on my Samsung Epic 4G, stock Froyo.  I played R-Type and the follow ups when they were coin-operated arcade machines long ago.  The graphical port is perfect, other than the R-Type title screen and music being changed.  You unlock each level as you beat it and as you defeat each level you can start a new game (and get a lower score overall) directly on each of the 8 levels.  My only complaint is that the R-9 ship you control moves at a faster speed than the original arcade game version, so it is very easy to crash the ship.  Despite the game being originally released in 1987, the graphics have held up well for the year 2011.  If you are a huge R-Type fan, this port will serve you well, but I don't think it is worth more than $.99 cents because today side scrolling shooters are a dime-a-dozen.

B005BGBPBG|5.0|Stuff like this doesn't happen in real life. Fall in love with the fiance, etc. But I loved this movie because you could actually see the difficulties of the characters. Sure you wondered about how THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE, but when does anything in movies happen in real life? It's why we watch them. But I definitely enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The previews feel like it gives the movie away, but it doesn't. Watch it!

B004EPZ08E|5.0|Really funny movie. I was let down by The Hangover 2 but this movie more than made up for it. The cast is great as is the writing. It's a R rated comedy so there is a lot of cursing and sexual situations so people who are offended easily by things of this sort, should look elsewhere. But if you are not easily offended there is a lot to like about this movie.  I will not give away spoilers but the story is actually pretty good too for a comedy like this.  Overall I had a blast at the theater watching this film and I have already pre ordered the Blu Ray. If you're a fan of R rated comedies, I highly recommend it!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I was hooked from the first book Ms. Moning wrote in this series and my love affair just kept going.  This series is, by far, the best Ive ever read. Shadowfever is my favorite book of all time.  I was lucky to read her Highlander series before Darkfever so I was able to catch the small scenes involving some of the characters from those books.  The way the author intertwines her characters is amazaing and fun to read.<br /><br />Ms. Moning's portrayal of a young girl who faced insurmountable odds and her transformation was fascinating. This storyline takes the reader to Dublin where MacKayla seeks her sister's murderer.  The story gets you at times because life is not all rainbows and no one knows that better than the heroine.  I could visualize every character in that book because the author is extremely descriptive.  And I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed Barrons.  I think every woman should have a Barrons in her life - it keeps things interesting.  This urban, paranormal series laced with erotism is highly recommended if you are looking for something with an edge.  And remember, stay to the lights!
B005G4TJI4|1.0|Crap, crap, crap. Bad acting, big explosions, and video game CGI a good movie does not make. Like a 2 hour Hasbro toy commercial. This film made Star Wars Episode 1 with Jar Jar Binks seem like an Academy Award worthy film. And I'm a Superhero/Godzilla/Monster geek...this is just awful...terrible. At least the first one was semi-watchable--and where's Megan Fox? That would have been the only redeeming quality in this junk-fest...I mean alien robots who change into cars and trucks??? It's a movie based on a TOY for God's sake! A bad toy made into an even worse film. Avoid like The Plague.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|overall the set is an even 4 stars, but i rated it 5 stars due to the fact that there are so many fans who felt the need to rate this item before they saw it for themselves and actually got a taste of what it held in store. Yes changes were made and yes not all of them were needed in the eye of the public, yes a digital copy should have been included, yes the original version should be there for those not wanting the updated versions. all those points aside, they looked and sounded great. one thing i think many people couldn't and cant get their heads around with star wars is the fact that it was and is created for children.... sorry that's what lucas said, and unlike some other long going shows star wars didn't really mature until episode 3 with the audience, at least not to the extent of harry potter or something along those lines. also people seem to easily forget all the great things that star wars has done for the movie industry. half of the great cgi and sound we have in movies is due to star wars.... if not more than that.... so for me star wars has always been about pushing boundaries and innovation forward, sometimes at the cost of a mistake or two but the fact that they do it means it will help everything in the long run. star wars is my childhood and i will always believe that i can move items with my mind if i try hard enough :D   May the force be with you... always

B005G48Y58|2.0|Started out as an interesting, intriguing story line and then probably in an effort to not be banal, the director decided to twist the story and go literally nowhere. Too bad. The movie could have really been thought-provoking, because the action wasn't really good. The actors did their job of course, but the story didn't take you anywhere, the ending was depressing, offered no satisfactory explanation as to why the main characters acted the way they did. In the end, it wasn't even an average action flick.

B004LWZW42|5.0|\\"X-Men: First Class\\" is a prequel to all three \\"X-Men\\" movies, following the story of two \\"Mutants\\" with superhuman abilities, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender), and their battles against evil Dr. Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) attempting to start World War III. The story that opens with a Nazi concentration camp focuses the friendship between Charles and Erik, better known as Professor X and Magneto, before they part ways and become opponents as seen in other three \\"X-Men\\" films.  There is one big action sequence involving the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 that is impressive, but \\"X-Men: First Class\\" is most effective when showing the contrasting (and complementary) personalities of the two main characters. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are convincing as Charles and Erik, played by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen respectively in the three preceding \\"X-Men\\" movies.   Having special abilities is not a welcome thing to some of the characters, like a genius scientist Hank McCoy / The Beast (Nicholas Hoult). The subplot deals with the relationship between Hank and Raven / Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), a shape shifter recruited as a government agent, but their story is not fully developed.   Producer-turned-director Matthew Vaughn has directed three films so far - \\"Layer Cake,\\" \\"Stardust\\" and \\"Kick-Ass,\\" all critically well-received. Again he has created compelling characters and the universe they live in, within the framework of the genre these films belong to.   Those who haven't seen the other \\"X-Men\\" films can enjoy \\"X-Men: First Class,\\" which works pretty well as a stand alone movie, but perhaps you should see the first two \\"X-Men\\" films directed by Brian Singer to understand the recurrent theme of the series, as well as some amusing references including Hugh Jackman's brief cameo.
0375758992|4.0|Don't Let's go to the Dogs Tonight is an honest and beautiful memoir of a grinding farm life in war torn post-Colonial Africa. The book is full of vividly rendered characters and senses. Think Out of Africa in a modern era and stripped of all romance. It is a heartbreaking, occasionally boring, and wonderfully elemental story.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Loving this app so far, I can tell it's going to get a LOT of use!! Excellent app, so glad I found it...
B0034G4ORM|5.0|Loved this movie. So glad I bought it on Blue-ray. I thought morters where exploding right outside my house. Within minutes the action kicked off and didn't stop. Great bonus features as well. I respect the fact that the actors did boot camp to get a real feel for their characters, don't forget to watch that. You will enjoy this movie.
038572179X|4.0|It took me a while to get into this book because McEwan's prose is rich (and at times heavy) delving into his character's conscious experiences moment by moment. I thought the whole story was going to be set in the opening scene in the country house, but then things take a turn when Briony witnesses a sexual exchange between Ceila and Robbie. From her childish viewpoint, she does not realise the huge consequences of what she does afterwards, which is tragic. The fate of the couple is heart-wrenching and stayed with me for days after finishing this book. I'm glad I haven't seen the film, it might have tainted my reading experience. Highly recommended, but McEwan's writing style gets a little getting used to.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|This is a great movie. Once again Blue-ray brought to life the quality in sound and picture. Recommend watching Wyatt Earp first. Not neccessary, but you'll have a good feel for the characters thanks to Wyatt Earp ending basically where Tombstone started. Liked the characters in Wyatt Earp better, but the acting is still great. A must see movie if you haven't already.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Anyone whos strong in the logical brain dept. along with an addictive personality trait will love this game! Very very cool brainy game and the characters are fun like in your childhood. this is the next Angry Birds. Non-thinkers and dullards need not play the game please.

B000FC1HBY|4.0|Ok, I'm 46 years old: Not the typical reader of GRRM, nor am I willing to admit to my friends that I read GRRM. But, after I enjoyed HBO's Game of Thrones, I thought I would give this a try.  This book is very engaging, and the sub plots are complex and rich.  Often, too rich.  I love the language and the story, but I could do without the long descriptions of what each (minor) character is wearing and his full back story.  I know this is crass, but this book would have been just as good  -  or better  - if it were 25% shorter.  I agree with other reviewers that is can also be a bit onerous reading chapter after chapter of gloom and doom.  Although, I suppose there was not much to be happy about in the Seven Kingdoms.  Overall: a solid read and much respect for the author.
B005G48Y58|4.0|This is a great movie. Good action and along the lines of noir intrigue...things aren't wrapped up in the standard Happy Meal fashion but end appropriately for the film...nothing too over the top but far enough out there to truly escape into an enjoyable action/intrigue film for a couple of hours.  And I must add: the young lady who plays the lead role is absolutely outstanding.  I look forward to her next piece of work.
B0051O8Z66|5.0|The product was in great condition when I got it and it played really well and sounded fantastic. It was a great buy!
0452270073|5.0|Many of the other reviewers have discussed this book's plot and its themes, as well as its remarkably good writing and its painstaking historical research. There's something else about this book that is also extraordinary: its sheer intelligence. Pat Barker introduces the reader not just to the mind of a remarkable psychiatrist, but also to  those of various soldiers suffering from various degrees of shell shock from World War I, as well as a woman who is dating one of these soldiers. In each case, the portrayal is so real, so human, so deep, and so lifelike that the book almost reads like non-fiction -- not just because Barker's understanding of the human mind is so profound, but because equally profound is her ability to use words to convey that understanding. This is a book that should be mandatory reading for anyone interested in the effects of war on the psyche, in the inner workings of the mind, in the early history of psychiatry, and most of all, for anyone who wants to spend many hours inside a world carved of thoughtfulness.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Paige Raborn  Arkansas)<br /><br />This series is suspenceful and amazing!  It was just as good and well written as the first one, in my opinion. The only problem is that you have to wait another year to read the next book and with Riordan's cliffhangers it is heart wrenching to stand the wait.  I thouroughly recommend this read to young readers
1933952806|1.0|The first thing I looked up, wireless remote, p. 125. is JUST PLAIN WRONG for the D7000. You can't set it on self-timer and use the remote. This guy cranks these manuals out in assembly line fashion evidently and copied and pasted from the D70 maybe?? or some other camera? Wonder what other inaccuracies are in there? Ridiculous for that kind of money. Basically just slightly more detailed (in places) than the manual and not as good as David Busch's Compact Field Guide, which is very nifty. Don't waste your money - there's better stuff out there.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I went into this BD presentation with an open mind - hoping for the utmost best and not knowing of the elements included. When the credits rolled though, I had my expectations of sound and picture exceeded in ways I had not even thought to foresee.<br /><br />Skipping the analogies and descriptions of those much wiser than me that analyze the depths of comprehension they all try to obtain in what he made here, I will stick with a product description. The picture clarity is without hesitation one of the best overall preservation pieces I have seen along any spectrum of what this film records: facial close-ups, skylines, spacial explorations, nature, urbanscapes, tears, moving water, dinosaurs, etc. I pause checked each variety of representations and could not find any faults - point being that he obviously had the budget when making this film, so this BD can prove the worth of your home theater whether testing lights, darks, movement or line clarity.<br /><br />The 7.1 sound immerses even more than Thin Red Line, to such a point that I wish I could include a picture I took of the opening frame that stated (for the first time that I know of in film): \\"For optimal sound reproduction, the producers of this Blu Ray recommend you play it loud\\". I played it extremely loud and have never been so pleased in how every single channel was used perfectly.<br /><br />The supplements are scant, but the main inclusion should almost be watched first to help one with understanding what is being presented here. I showed this 29-minute piece to several viewers first and I actually found that there was a better comprehension and appreciation for what he was doing here than watching it without any foreknowledge. The 2nd disc is a bare bones DVD converted down to 5.1 Dolby. Disc 3 is a standard Dig Copy. Region coded A.<br /><br />If you are sitting on the fence about this film, at least you will not be disappointed in the Blu, truly a keeper for the home library for a variety of reasons.

B004ZN9UZO|5.0|I have always thought this is a great album.  As for the remaster, to my ears, it is the best that I have heard so far of the Pink Floyd remasters.  I've owned this on LP, as well as the original Columbia late-80's \\"silver\\" disc and the circa-2000 remaster.  Listening to the 2011 remaster, there are details about the songs on this album that I never heard before.  It's the small details that stand out, the drums sounding more powerful, the man whistling for the dog on \\"Dogs\\", little things your ears probably never picked up on prior editions.  Well worth the money.
0618680004|3.0|Essentially Dawkins makes the logical fallacy of setting up a Straw Man in his book the God Delusion with the basic premise of the book being that God has to be a created being Himself in time, which is a God that Christians do not believe in at least with the belief that God is eternal. So while Dawkins is clear that in the beginning of his book that he doesn't believe in any supernatural god or goddess, his book never addresses an argument for why he doesn't think that the eternal God can be real.  Dawkins merely assumes that he can change the nature of the Biblical God in order to have a god that Dawkins can write an effective argument exist.  As a Christian, I enjoyed reading Dawkins effective arguments against gods which I do not believe exist; however, I think that his misunderstandings of the Christian God are particularly clear, moreover, I think he misunderstands what a lot of other religions teach about their gods as well.  I certainly did enjoy reading the book and he got a lot of facts right even if his conclusions don't follow the argument that he makes in his book The God Delusion.

B0050PYNN0|1.0|I didn't have any idea (based on the preview I saw a while back) what this movie would be like. Thinking this would be a medieval comedy spoof .. I wasn't prepared for the excess gore and violence. So this review is for parents or (squeamish adults like me) just to state the facts.. not to get into a discussion of the movie. If you are already planning on watching it regardless, then please don't read the rest of my review, as it could possible contain spoilers for people who like the shock of blood spurting out at them as they watch.  Whether or not the violence in this movie is done as a farce, doesn't matter to me. While my brain might be able to discern that -my eyeballs don't- and the images are stuck there. (Funny how, by pure coincidence, I was reading (the night before watching this movie) a review in a science magazine article about how damaging- scary & violent movies are for kids. One way shown through their research, is that it disrupts their sleep patterns. Also shown was how those kind of movies for kids have other negative effects, including on their forming personalities and their behavior towards other kids.) So I thought since some ratings don't often let you know the kind of the things you might actually witness on the screen, here is just a partial list to let you know whether you would want your kids to watch this:   Severed heads and limbs and fingers, with full blood spurting effects and complete with drippy stringy stuff, a scalping complete with full view of top of said head and two characters tossing the scalp back and forth like a hot potato, full body impalements on very big sticks (and later swords), cutting off a minotaurs naked genitalia and then wearing it around neck- just to name a few.   Also there are scenes with near rapes (with one involving an animal type figure) There is also a pedophile alien creature who wants disgusting things. So, lots of blood spurting, some nudity (both sexes and a beast) and lots of use of words that start with F.   As for my overall rating for the movie.. it is based on the fact that they so missed their opportunities with this very uneven movie. They could have made a really (consistently) funny movie with the good actors they had on board but they took another route with lots of strange \\"over-the top\\" parts for shock value I guess, and gore and chronic cussing instead of a better-thought-out and well-paced parody.
B005BZQS1E|1.0|To be fair, I only got about 30 minutes in but in those 30 minutes there was enough bad acting, terrible humor (a pedophile wizard whose a good guy? incest jokes between two brothers, and ill placed cursing. I mean even the actors delivered the curses with an \\"excuse me, I say F*** here? Really?\\".<br /><br />While this isn't as bad as Highlander II it's far too close for any movie to be. Even if you are a lover of bad cinema (and I grew up with Troma) this movie will make you annoyed.

0767802659|2.0|When my high school English class read \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" the teacher stressed the point that Mark Twain despised the people that would try to find a deeper meaning in his stories.  I took Mark Twain's philosophy to heart and I agree with it 100%.  With that in mind there are several points that need to be made.<br /><br />I am a voracious reader of everything Heinlein and do not need to be told that he was a libertarian.  I did not need to meet him in person.  His tremendous body of work speaks for itself.  Anyone who has read \\"Friday\\" or \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" or any of his other works cannot help but know his political leanings.  After all, the creator of TANSTAAFL could be nothing else than a libertarian.  However, I do not pretend to know his mind and would not, for one second, attempt to speak for him.<br /><br />It is my opinion (for what it is worth) that Heinlein would be appalled at this cartoonish attempt at recreating his book with film.  No, I do not believe that the creators had any esoteric motives in mind at all.  I honestly feel that they tried to make a serious movie based on Heinlein's book and failed miserably.  The point has been made here that if you did not see the underlying value of this movie that you had \\"missed the point\\".  It is my contention that they have missed the point.<br /><br />The empirical evidence cannot be ignored.  I understand that books cannot reach the screen in their entirety.  It would take too many hours of screen time to produce even a short book.  No film company could possibly afford to spend this much time on a movie and the public would not sit still in a theater that long. What I do not understand is the ego and arrogance of screenwriters that think they can do it better or make it more entertaining.  If a book has garnered enough readership to become noticeable enough to make into a movie then why do these charlatans think they have to change the basic story?  Time and time again these pretentious schmoes have taken a book and tried to make it entertaining and have made box office flops.  The sad part is that they do not learn from their mistakes and even sadder is that Hollywood keeps paying them and using their \\"expertise\\" over and over again.  I feel that is what has happened here.<br /><br />Why did the creators of this film choose one of Heinlein's lesser important novels?  I cannot say.  But I can make a guess.  Maybe they felt that it was a \\"splashy\\" Science Fiction book that could make some money.  Well they really screwed the pooch on that one!  This venture did not turn out to be tremendously profitable. Why some studio decided to throw more money at it by making a sequel is way beyond my scope of understanding.  THEN THEY MADE A THIRD MOVIE!!!  A great deal of money has been sunk into three \\"B\\" quality movies.<br /><br />Okay, okay, I have stood on my soapbox long enough.  Would I recommend this movie?  If you are a diehard Heinlein fan then steer clear of it.  It will piss you off.  It is the first time I have not watched the bonus features on a DVD as I did not care how this movie was made.  However, if you are looking for mindless entertainment on a Saturday night and can find this movie in a clearance bin somewhere then buy it.  It is slightly entertaining and the special effects are adequate.<br /><br />P.S.  If you are thinking of buying this movie because Denise Richards is in it don't bother.  Her acting is as horrid as usual and she doesn't show her tits even once.make it entertaining and have made box office flops.

B005974CNA|4.0|This is the eleventh studio album by Dream Theater, A Dramatic Turn of Events.  On the Backs of Angels is the one everyone's already heard on Youtube; this 8 minute song blasts out some heavy riffs and yet many melodic passages. It hearkens back to the song Pull Me Under for its interesting polyrhythms and off-beats. All in all a good song, but not the best by a long shot.  Build Me Up, Break Me Down is absolute garbage upon first listen. It's like Dream Theater tried to be a combination of Linkin Park and Avenged Sevenfold for this one song. Electronic drum intros and blatantly numetal riffs start the song off and keep it going. As a song, it's not all that bad after a few listens. As a Dream Theater song, I consider it my second least favorite behind You Not Me.  Lost Not Forgotten has an interesting piano tune at the beginning and some awkwardly atonal instrumentals before the vocals, but remains a good song through the chorus and several instrumentals later. It clocks in at around ten minutes like other tracks on the album, but doesn't feel nearly that long. Reasonably good, but still not quite one of the top tunes of the album.  This is the Life is beautiful. It's a pretty song with fantastic melody and action when necessary. There isn't much to say besides that. Very pleasant and one of the better tunes of the album.  Bridges in the Sky is one of the top two songs on this album. With an interesting albeit somewhat odd intro of a low tribal growl and a pleasant choir, this song cuts right into the super heavy riffs. The riffs are all pretty original and sound great. The weight of the song does NOT defy the melodic proceedings. The chorus and bridges are some of the greatest passages I've heard from Dream Theater yet. incredible solo and instrumental sections with a good amount of Middle-Eastern influence, it sounds like. I absolutely love this song.  Outcry is one of the better songs on the album, making a \\"UNITE!\\" theme among many fictional songs. Some of thebeginning of the song has electronic drum functions, but they are done well and in good context. The instrumentals in this song are also top-notch, but the melodies aren't quite as powerful in my opinion. Good, but not quite at the very top.  Far From Heaven is short, sweet, and to the point. It's the Wait For Sleep to the LTL that is Breaking All Illusions. It's not a song I would ordinarily listen to on its own like I would Wait For Sleep. It's not nearly as intertwined with its counterpart as WFS and LTL were, but it's still pleasant and pretty.  Breaking All Illusions is the best song on this album. The ingenuity in the instrumentals is very reminiscent of Images and Words, though not nearly as simple. The vocal passages are incredible and add a truly powerful vibe to the entirety. There is plenty of originality with plenty of basslines, style changes, solos, mood shifts, and etc to keep the listener interested, though I must admit that there aren't nearly as many catchy riffs as there used to be in their earlier work.  Beneath the Surface is a wonderful closer that feels a lot like Hollow Years. Mostly acoustic, with an odd but tasty Moog solo in the middle. James' vocals shine on this track and the acoustics and piano blend effortlessly. Reasonably short and very beautiful.  Overall, the mix was cleanest I've heard in a long time for Dream Theater. Guitars didn't overpower any other instruments, and in turn was not overpowered by any instruments. The bass was pretty clearly audible throughout most of the album, which added whole new dimensions to the overall sound. John Myung's lines in previous albums were very drowned out and made the songs less interesting and moderately mediocre. Mangini's drums are a better tribute to Mike Portnoy's original Dream Theater style than Mike Portnoy's drums have been on the last album. There were some real true polyrhythms and some syncopation, but this album's riffs aren't quite as catchy as the more renowned albums like I&Wor MP2:SFAM. All in all, this album is incredibly good, probably the best release since Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. Far truer to the prog aspect than any album (in its entirety) since then, at least. Mike Portnoy's departure is sad, yes, but it gave some vigor to the remaining members to make an incredible album, inspired Mangini, and honestly, cut out some of the growl core crap that Portnoy had been working into the mix (A Nightmare to Remember was one of the biggest disgraces I'd ever heard Dream Theater attempt to release as an \\"epic\\").
B005DI9906|5.0|THE FOUR FEATHERS, A.E.W. Mason's epic adventure novel, has been filmed on several occasions, most recently in 2002, but this British-made 1939 production, directed by Zoltan Korda, is certainly the best of them all.<br /><br />John Clements plays the British soldier in Queen Victoria's army who resigns from his regiment shortly before it is to be sent to the Sudan to capture the city of Khartoum.  Branded a coward by both his friends and fiance', he ultimately disguises himself as a Sudanese native and sets out to rescue his former comrades.<br /><br />The action sequences in this Technicolor production are nothing short of fantastic.

B005KAH7QU|1.0|Eric Bana is not an action star, has no athletic ability and yet he somehow teaches a young girl how to fight?   Saoirse Ronan did a good job of making it believable that she could fight and do all those amazing things, although not as well as Chloë Grace Moretz, better known as \\"Hit Girl\\".   The dialog was done fairly well but was over shadowed by the comical fight scenes with Bana and the assassins sent to kill Hanna.   Within ten minutes I found myself wishing I had not spent the money to watch this movie. A wannabe \\"Hit Girl\\" movie.  Just my opinion.
034552554X|5.0|The bouquet I would make to describe my reaction to The Language of Flowers would include Apple Blossom (preference), Everlasting Pea (lasting pleasure), Bouvardia (enthusiasm) and Lisianthus (appreciation). Vanessa Diffenbaugh has created an extraordinary book that captivated me and still lingers in my thoughts almost two weeks after I finished it.<br /><br />The Language of Flowers is Vanessa Diffenbaugh's debut novel and I was blown away by the maturity of her writing, by the bravery of choosing an imperfect and damaged heroine and by the smooth flow of the story. I believe that Vanessa Diffenbaugh has a long and interesting writing career ahead if her and I look forward to following her progress.<br /><br />I first heard about the Victorian language of flowers when I was in primary school and I remember thinking that it sounded very mysterious and that it was a bit like sending coded messages to the one you loved. I wasn't too far off.<br /><br />Victoria Jones is a damaged young girl who can't, or won't, let herself connect to the world around her except through the medium of flowers and their meanings. Through Victoria's eyes you will come to appreciate the subtlety and nuances of the language of flowers. It's this window into Victoria's mind that really allows the reader to connect with her and understand what she feels, despite her trying to hide it.<br /><br />The Language of Flowers is split into four parts; each named for a flower or a particular flower's meaning. These flowers and their meanings serve as the underlying theme for that part of the story and I loved how Diffenbaugh brings Victoria's precious language of flowers into every aspect of her story.<br /><br />Victoria's life has not been an easy one; abandoned as a baby, shuttled around the foster care system and forced to look out for herself. But Vanessa Diffenbaugh doesn't place the blame solely on circumstances. Victoria's life is the product of neglect, bad luck and her own bad choices. Through the story Victoria is forced to take some of the responsibility for herself and her own decisions. The Language of Flowers alternates between the present and eight years ago, when Victoria feels she last had a real chance at happiness. These two separate tales combine to tell Victoria's story and paint a complex and detailed picture of her character and her life.<br /><br />But it's through her connection to other people that Victoria slowly begins to heal and learn to take part in the world around her. Grant and Elizabeth are two lovely characters who play such an important role in Victoria's life. Diffenbaugh has given them their own complex stories and pasts to add flavour and depth to the story. Though they help Victoria, they are also helped by knowing her. It's this interconnectedness of the characters that makes The Language of Flowers such a fulfilling read.<br /><br />The Language of Flowers is a beautiful piece of storytelling.he responsibility for herself and her own decisions.

B004R6JG7G|5.0|I bought this movie a little while ago... and I must say, it's absolutely amazing!! I wasn't expecting the blu-ray conversion to be as good as it is, so I was really surprised when I started watching Top Gun. It brought back so many memories from when I had seen it as a kid. If you're a fan of Top Gun, you won't be disappointed. The sound is also wonderful!! And since I have a good system, the surround sounds just blew me away... it's a whole new experience now.  I also liked the special features available in the disc; though I don't know if there were any special edition DVD's that might've offered more. Overall this something to own.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game is very well written. It is fluid, has just enough challenge, and great customization. Stances mixed with the merit point system allows for easy changes if your frist strategy doesn't take down that boss. My two favorite aspects are that the game warns you before every boss fight so you know when to heal, and that the game has items such as campsites (full heal outside of battle) so you don't have to partake in the tedious crap japenese rpgs are notorious for.

B004EPZ08O|2.0|\\"Death doesn't like to be cheated.\\" When a group of employees on a work retreat head out on a bus one of the employees has a vision of a bridge collapse. When he tells everyone to get off only a few listen. All but eight die and the standard \\"Final Destination\\" plot takes over. This one did have a little different twist in it, but not enough to make it feel original again. If you are a fan of the series you will probably like this one. I have seen them all, and after the second one the only real exciting part for me was watching the way they kill people off. It may just be me, but after the \\"Final Destination\\", \\"Saw\\" and \\"Scream\\" series' it seems like all the cool ideas have been taken. There is really not much to say about this one that hasn't already been done. Un-original ideas, un-original deaths, un-original dialog...but from the fifth movie in a series this isn't a surprise and can't be held against it. On the other hand, if you can't think of any more ideas that you haven't seen before then don't make a new installment. The one great spot in the movie is the way that it ends...watch it and you will see what I mean. Overall, if you like the other four you will most likely like this one too. Just don't expect anything new. I give it a C.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I don't think so. Not really a series you can watch over and over.<br /><br />*Also try - Final Destination 1-4

0316056863|2.0|Three things about \\"Bossypants\\": One: The cover doesn't reflect the contents, it's just creapy without being funny. Her dad was right about it. Two: I expected some meaty content with intelligent slants and maybe some politics... and of course, humor. This book missed all of those opportunities and was more of a \\"how I got rich and successful\\" book. Three: Buy Laura Hillenbrand's book, \\"Unbroken\\" for a great and gripping biography and slice of American life. It has as much humor as Tina's (very little) even though it's a serious look at a man's life and his struggles to stay alive.

B005ELZKWS|5.0|Really, just putting it into words does not do this collection justice.  I loved the debut CD, but this one blows it out of the water.  Combining a healthy dose of \\"fun\\" rockers (\\"Bigfoot\\", \\"Alright, Alright) and deeper, more series offerings (\\"I need a Job\\", \\"Who's Next) the CD has a deeper, darker feel to it but maintains a healthy, fun vibe as well.  The best song on the CD has to me \\"Something Going On\\", but the hidden track \\"untitled\\" (or maybe call it \\"No Change\\" is a phenominally powerful offering, both musically and lyricall.  The opening track \\"Last Temptation\\" is incredible, again both musically and lyrically.  \\"Lighten Up\\" will get your pulse pounding.  And \\"Come Closer\\" is one of the most beautiful and moving songs i've heard in a long, long time.  Really, you can listen to this from front to back and there's not a bad song in the entire offering.  Thanks to Sammy, Joe, Mike and Chad for doing rock the way it should be done!

B005DKLPF6|3.0|I am a strong fan of Mastodon's recorded music. I say recorded, because unlike one of the reviewers, I feel it's Mastodon's usual gravelly raspy vocals that none of them can actually pull off unless they're in a studio with special effects and not playing instruments at the same time. Brann is possibly the exception, usually singing clean, but how often does he get to sing? Come to think of it, Mastodon needing to tour supporting an album with songs they can actually sing in concert would explain a lot about The Hunter, though not everything.  Anyway, I am a strong fan of Mastodon albums (and the EP). I would rate Leviathan five stars because the songs are well composed and because it was revolutionary at the time. No one had ever sounded like that before, including Mastodon. Blood Mountain gets four stars from me. Pretty good album--basically in the vein of Leviathan, but not quite as good and obviously not as revolutionary. Crack the Skye also gets five stars. I can understand the Mastodon fans who were disappointed by Crack the Skye because it was not as heavy and for other reasons. I for one liked the songs (most of them). The album had seriousness (Why does Skye have an E), the songs were thematically connected, and it was musically original (though some will disagree). I believe it is a masterpiece and deserved a Grammy nomination (if it got one, and I somehow missed it, somebody let me know).   Now, we come to The Hunter. This can't be five stars. It lacks the originality and brilliance of Leviathan or the coherence and novelty of Crack the Skye. It can't be a one star either. That would mean, to me, that most of the songs are unlistenable. Closing in from the top again, it's no four either. That would mean it's another Blood Mountain. I can't think of a single track on The Hunter as good as Sleeping Giant. Hunters of the Sky, or Siberian Divide, although \\"The Hunter\\" (track) seems to be hearkening back in that direction a little. Two stars? As I'm listening,it just doesn't have the irritation factor I expect from two stars. Even Curl of the Burl, which has an irritating name, I couldn't bring myself to fast forward through (and least the second or third time--after that, who knows). The one exception is Creature Lives, which makes me want to shoot myself, and not in a good way (it's Yes, whose early work I love, after they decided to stink). On the other hand, there are some songs, like The Sparrow, that I was surprised to find out I like.  So, that leaves me at three stars.  This is never going to be a classic Mastodon album. It's just not original enough. Most of the tracks sound like simplified--can I say it?--HAPPIER sounding versions of older Mastodon. An exception is Curl of the Burl, of course, which sounds like Govt. Mule with metal fuzz. Mule fans who like metal, I wonder if that track hits the spot? I imagine it will be one of those albums that people buy in one of two ways. 1. You are a die hard Mastodon fan and you will buy anything they put out. Some of you apparently love this album. Fine. Either way, you bought it. Or, 2. This is the first, or one of the first Mastodon albums, you ever bought. If you even sort of like The Hunter, you may be in for a treat, going back to discover Crack the Skye and possibly Leviathan (though you might not have the stomach for the vocals in early Masto right away).  If you're in camp #1, you may listen to The Hunter a few more times because you have worn out the tracks in your LP or CD or MP3s of the earlier ones. Familiarity may make some of the tracks sound better with time. Maybe some worse. There is value in this album. It's not a beer coaster. Unless I'm stunningly mistaken, it's not a future retroactive masterpiece either. Three. Stars.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I ordered this product because i though i could unlock the core and see if it had 6 cores.Unfortunately if it does i don't know how to unlock it because i am missing a function in BIOS.I don't remember what it was but some 3DMark Test show 2 additional slots which may be processors.  This processor is very powerful.As good as it is.You should be able to overclock it to 4300 easily.An only be around 51c.This one i has a very noisy Fan.I recommend getting a water cooler. All benchmarks are high.I have a AMD Phenom II X6 1100t Which runs about the same level of smoothness.This edition can be overclocked easily and there was no lag on this model.This processor i would recommend.
1439192812|5.0|Thank you Professor Dawkins for explaining to me the Magic of Reality.... everyone should go out and get this book. If the United States replaced their science textbooks with the Magic of Reality, more people would accept science as factual. The problem with science in America (whether true or not), the science classes are flat out boring and the textbooks are even more boring. This is most likely why Theists in America accept faith over science... it's an easier way to explain the origins of our universe. All I can say is if I had this book back in 2005 - 2007, I probably wouldn't have been a Christian at the time.<br /><br />In his book, Dawkins goes beyond his evolutionary field and explains to us what a sun is, what a rainbow is, what an earthquake is, where does the sun go at night and why do bad things happen... or better why does anything happen as Dawkins puts it. Each chapter begins with a myth, anywhere from the Greek myth to the Christian myth (and I admit, they are quite fun to read)... but Dawkins ends each chapter explaining the science behind the questions and more importantly, how the science is much more interesting than the myths.<br /><br />The illustrations are quite beautiful. Dave McKean being my favorite comic book artists, illustrates how weird these myths are and then goes on to illustrate how even more weird the science is. Dawkins couldn't have picked a better illustrator in my opinion for The Magic of Reality. I met Dawkins in a book signing for this book and he was quite nice and autographed my book. I admit, I didn't ask him anything because I was nervous. I only wish Dave McKean was there as well.<br /><br />Go out and get this book, and make it your goal to explain to children the science behind this world and do so the way this book does it. Science is dropping down in the United States and we need people like Dawkins to stand up and help it so it doesn't crumble.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Oh my! This has to be the best story I've read in a while!  The characters are believable and you imagine yourself caught up in their whirlwind.  Just when you think the story is over, it takes another turn.  Most stories skim the surface.  This one give you what you long to read in every book. Beautiful ending! It doesn't leave you hanging, but it finishes their story in a great way.  I finished it in one day because it was too intriguing to put down.

That's one period that I wish I could go back to. I still have 2 toy Batmobiles, a toy Batwing, a model Batwing, and a couple of posters. I even have the comic adaptation and novel as well as the trading cards. The first Batman movie, as well as the second, Batman Returns, is what Batman is supposed to be. Don't pay any attention to Batman Begins and Dark Knight. They're nothing compared to the Michael Keaton films. They're dark, but not too dark. They're really fun and Jack Nicholson as the Joker is pure creepy perfection. I can't think of anything bad about these movies....well, the first two movies, anyway. The music is outstanding. The theme was even used as the opening and closing theme music for the animated series.

B000JMLDCS|3.0|I recommend this book for the excellent writing and as a window into a fascinating, brilliant mind. However, as a defense of theism in general and Christianity in particular, it falls flat.<br /><br />In this volume, Chesterton tells why he chose to believe in Christianity. He explains with eloquence and wit why he considers that religion beneficial to individuals and societies. However, the book is clearly also meant as an argument for the objective truth of Christianity, and on that count it will only convince people who already agree with him or who desperately wish to believe.<br /><br />He argues that there must be a god because, among other reasons, it is an appealing, comforting idea that lets him view the world as both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. He also says that Christianity is an excellent source of personal and creative energy and moral/social stability, and it therefore must be true.<br /><br />This is not a convincing argument. In fact, it's no argument at all. Ideas are not true just because someone finds them pretty or functional. They are true or untrue on their own, whether pretty or not.<br /><br />Chesterton trots out all sorts of easily refuted reasoning. For instance, he harps on the idea that rational thought leads to evil. After all, he says, if there is no external Divine measure of things, one can justify all manner of mayhem. The obvious counter-argument is that if one believes absolutely in the doctrines and dogmas of a religion, one can also justify all manner of mayhem, and people do so regularly. Both theists and atheists can be either kind or cruel, so the argument falls of its own weight.<br /><br />The book is filled with generalizations whose falseness must have been obvious even at the time. Take, for instance, his sweeping claim that people who work in \\"rational\\" professions such as math and science are prone to go mad, but poets and artists are not and that faith is a balm against mental insanity.<br /><br />The author is also fond of circular reasoning: he plugs in his conclusions as assumptions and tries to use them to prove themselves. He does this, for example, in his infuriatingly callous rant on the subject of suicide.<br /><br />In addition, he insinuates that one must either believe in a deity (preferably his favorite one) or else believe in nothing and be awed by nothing. This is perhaps the most absurd generalization in the book. Are the wonders of an infinite universe \\"nothing\\"? Is fascination with and study of a world that can surprise us at every turn \\"nothing\\"? Is reality so devoid of interest that we need to make things up? Obviously there are things in the universe we do not understand. However, one of the wisest things I was taught as a child is that when you don't know the answer to a question, the appropriate response is \\"I don't know.\\"<br /><br />As a personal narrative this book is fine. The author's perennial wit and his way with words suffuse the text. But as an attempt at persuasion, it's like watching a kid play a video game: Chesterton sets up and knocks down one straw-man argument after another, smashing each one with false dichotomies, dubious generalizations or subjective assertions before moving on to the next level of the game.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|In addition to the great director and actors, this movie has a gritty realism with deep characters I really got into.  Each of the side stories were relatable to common people.  Sexual disfunction, emotional scarring locking someone away from the world, opening up relationships, younger/older attraction dynamics, suicide's impact on others, topics mainstream movies won't touch. I felt like I was stepping into the very lives of these characters, living with their demons, struggles, and triumphs.  If you're a prude, a homophobe, close minded, whatever, stay away.  If you can relax and enjoy life in its many facets, then get this movie.

0374290024|4.0|Ian Morris's \\"Why the West Rules\\" is one of the latest in a line of \\"Grand Theory of History\\" books, a category that includes Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\". Like all of these books, it is about examining why the western European nations pulled ahead of the rest of the world in the late 18th century/early 19th century in economic and military terms. Morris traces this history from the end of the last Ice Age to the present era, focusing on what he calls the \\"Western\\" and \\"Eastern\\" cores - namely, the civilizations that emerged in Southeast Asia/Europe/northern Africa, and the civilization that evolved into China. While the overall history is broad, Morris does delve into quite a few specific details about the politics and economics of specific eras, particularly the past two thousand years in both Europe and China. He ultimately ties this into a broad theory that argues for the central importance of geography in ultimately shaping why \\"the West rules\\", and why it pulled ahead of the Chinese.   As a broad, sweeping history of Europe and China, this book is an excellent read for laymen. While the European history is mostly well-known and described in other books, Morris really shines when doing his history of Chinese economic and political development, and comparing it to European development. Particularly interesting were the chapters on the Song Dynasty in the 11th and 12th centuries A.D., which came very close to a pre-Industrial society, and might have led the way had it not been ravaged by nomads out of central Asia (particularly the Mongols). The book is worth reading for the historical chapters up to about 1900 AD (chapters 3-9) alone.   Unfortunately, while the book makes for an interesting history, Morris's actual theory on why the West pulled ahead is rather vague and tepid. His theory is centered in geography, and while he makes some good points about how this influenced western and Chinese development, his ultimate theoretical jumps - such as howthe reliance on oceanic trade and the Atlantic economy created the \\"mechanical universe\\" worldview of the Enlightenment - don't quite fit. Quite often, the historical evidence that he presents argues the opposite of his position, with short-term factors making huge differences in Western and Eastern development.  He also never quite ties everything into his theory in the last couple of chapters, which devolve into a rather bland set of predictions about the future of Social Development using the \\"Social Development Index\\" that he created.   As I mentioned earlier, the book is worth reading for the historical chapters alone. I strongly suggest buying it, or at least reading it from the library for this purpose. But when reading it, read it as a broad history, and not with expectations of a real explanation for why the West rules.

B004EPZ00C|5.0|Rowan Atkinson shows once again why he is widely considered to be one of the top living comics. In lesser hands this film would not have been worth the price of admission. It took me back to the glory days of Peter Sellers and the inimitable Inspector Clouseau. Atkinson is also supported by a strong supporting cast including Gillian Anderson and the very lovely Rosamund Pike (Die Another Day). I can actually remember some James Bond films that I didn't find as entertaining as this movie is. I don't know why it took eight years to get this sequel. I would not mind another outing for Johnny English if it is as much fun as this one. Be sure to watch the end credits for one last scene!!
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Scotty McCreery's Clear As Day is definately a great hit, and I would recommend everyone to buy it! Although he is only an 18 year old boy, his deep voice and passion for music is clear to see! Clear As Day is full of uptempo songs and also slow songs. It is #1 on Itunes, and Scotty is just overall such a charismatic, amazing singer. He won American Idol season 10 when he was only 17 with a record of 122 million votes against runner-up Lauren Alaina. He is also very mature but at the same time can be funny. I would recommend everyone to listen and buy Scotty McCreery's Clear As Day!
B005KR6NS6|5.0|Sally Potter gives a truly wonderful performance as the woman who becomes almost mezmerized by the dance.  She learns the very traditional tango from a young Argentine dancer. Traditional tango is an extremely sexual, sensual dance where the man goes through the steps of seducing and controlling his partner's every move. Remember, the argentine tango has it's roots in the brothels of Argentina and for many years was banned in polite society. By the time the tango reached North America it had gained respectability and risen to a true art dance form. In this film Sally Porter begins to assert the role of a modern liberated woman who is no longer content to be completely directed and controled by the man. Her partner is at first dismayed and angry that she wants to assert herself and their dancing becomes more and more like a battle. The tango becomes a metaphor for a woman's struggle for equality. The dancing alone is enough to highly recommend this film. The underlying ideas just make it that much better.

1423140591|5.0|I recently purchased Rick Riordan's newest book in the hit series The Heroes of Olympus. I bought the hardback version and was a little surprised to see quite a few typos in the book. After reading the Percy Jackson series this was a shock. The cast of characters was excellently done (As usual) and the book gave you time to actually get to know the new kids Hazel and Frank. I was partially annoyed that Percy Jackson came back in this new series because i was hoping for something a little more original. The book's action scenes were amazing as always with nonstop action and excitement. I can't wait for Riordon's next book The Mark of Athena but i do hope that he gets a new editor!
1439152799|5.0|I love all of Kate Morton's books.  Morton has such a wonderful command of the English language that her books are a joy to read.  She is a great story teller and the reader is immersed in the world that she creates.  The Distant Hours took the reader right into the middle of the Sisters' world and their secrets.  The story in The Distant Hours is a good one and wonderfully told with many twists and turns to keep you guessing until the very end.  The common complaint seems to be that the novel bogs down during the first part.  I felt that, too, when I was reading it...but pushed past it to be well rewarded as the story picked up and moved along for the rest of the book.  Looking back at the part I felt was slow, I think all of the information there was necessary to establish the characters of the sisters and to really understand the later developments in the story.  This book has rich characters that aren't easily forgotten.  I found myself thinking about this book long after I had finished it.  A good read!
B0001VV1GK|1.0|Our son got this Plan Toys parking garage set as a gift last Christmas. He has had it for about 10 months now and only plays with it on occasion inside the house. (He got it for his second birthday and was just a little bit young to really start playing with it until the last few months, when it seems to interest him a lot more.)  He has some hotwheels cars that work with it just fine, in addition to the little wooden one that came with it. I have no complaints about the single car - if you read the description carefully, you'll see that it tells you that you only get one car.  I came back to write this review now because the quality is so poor. Like other reviewers, I added this toy to his wish list instead of one of the plastic parking garage toys (that I have fond memories of from when I was a kid) because I liked the Plan Toys company and how they do business in such a responsible manner. We thought it would be worth the premium price tag to support that company. When we put it together last Christmas, my husband and I both remarked on how sturdy the wood seemed, how it felt like this toy would last forever and maybe even become a toy for our son's kids someday. That's turned out not to be the case.  I have now glued the lower ramp back on twice and found it lose again just this weekend. The design is weird - the pegs are on the bottom of the ramp and gravity just naturally works against it so that the pressure of cars on the ramp eventually push the pegs out. This next time I'll bypass the wood glue and use Gorilla glue on it. I also had to glue the top ramp last spring for the same reason. Most recently, however, the elevator stopped working. It might be hard to tell from the picture/description, but you turn the flat black knob on top to move the elevator up and down. It takes a little more elbow grease than the plastic versions of this toy require to move the elevator, which isn't really a problem for us, but I expect it to work properly. Inside the elevatorshaft, there is a simple string mechanism that winds around the top as you turn the knob. Somehow the string has gotten off track or gotten stretched out or something and now the elevator doesn't work anymore. This part of the toy came pre-assembled, and there's no way that I can get to the string mechanism to try and trouble-shoot the problem or fix it without taking the toy apart in ways that look irreversible. It's pretty worthless at this point.  Our son is very small for his age (almost 3) and he is never rough or abusive with his toys. I wish I could attribute the problems with this toy to wear and tear, but the fact is that it's severely overpriced for what you get. We won't purchase any more toys from Plan. I'd recommend you not purchase this unless you find it on clearance someplace for less than $20. The lesson I've learned is just to buy the shiny plastic version of a toy like this - the kids like them better anyway. :)
B003E8AF5U|5.0|MGMT founders, Benjamin Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden, were unceremoniously catapulted into fame with the release of Oracular Spectacular--a place that they didn't appear to comfortably occupy.  The crowds of excessively adoring adolescents were perceived by the band as a pseudo-fan base.  The darkly tinged lyrics of \\"Time to Pretend\\" and \\"Kids\\" seemed lost on the blithe crowds who quickly targeted the album as the latest, must-have fad.  The result was a flurry of interviews and award show appearances for which the band appeared to be ill-suited.  Therefore, for their second venture, they seem to have distanced themselves from the style that forced them into the limelight--a style that was simply one of many in their creative repertoire.<br /><br />With Congratulations, MGMT has meticulously crafted a musical journey that meanders through various soundscapes and experiments with broad variations in tempo and style.  Although the universal sentiment is one of introspection and disillusionment, it is not crowded with thoughts and messages of gloom.  While it would be fitting to assert that the drifting guitar riffs and psychedelic instrumentals are reminiscent of such classic rock influences as Pink Floyd, it must also be affirmed that the band has maintained a sense of innovation and novelty.  It's safe to assume that there are no top 40 hits on this album, but this was likely intentional.  It seems that, on this outing, MGMT's artistic course was a direct reaction to the standards of the radio industry, as accessibility was not a consideration.  After all, their intended audience is not the mainstream crowd that flocked to their previous release.<br /><br />\\"Congratulations\\" is one of those singular albums that needs to be experienced with an uninterrupted flow, as each track blends seamlessly into the next.  While there are certainly stand out tracks, such as \\"Someone's Missing\\" and \\"Flash Delirium,\\" the remainder of the album should not be considered any less momentous.  Despite the variations, both in the midst of songs and among tracks, they play off of each other in a manner that makes them all significant to the thesis.  The album closes with the title track, which is configured of equal parts melodrama, dripping sarcasm, and antipathy.  As alluded to in the lyrics, Goldwasser and VanWyngerden could have easily remained complacent in their overnight success.  Instead, they chose to challenge their expansive audience to see which ones were really getting the message, and separate them from those who were simply there for the party.spite the variations, both in the midst of songs and among tracks, they play off of each other in a manner that makes them all significant to the thesis.

0062112430|5.0|First off, I just want to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The main character, Lena, is so well-developed. I loved that Oliver decided to make Lena one of the \\"sheep\\" of her community at first instead of a rebellious teen with something to prove...instead, she used her best friend, Hana for that role instead. As a reader, you got to see Lena really taken the blindfold off of her eyes and take the cotton out of her ears so that she could see her dystopian world for what it really was...a monster that needed to be put down.<br /><br />When I read the premise of the book, I was a little put off...I was wondering how an author could create a world where love was a dangerous, deadly thing, but after reading only a few chapters...that nightmare seemed like a very real possibility. Oliver's use of medical terminology, symptomology, historical references, and the introduction of the Book of Shh concerning amor deliria nervosa was absolutely ingenious.<br /><br />Alex was also a mysterious, yet well-developed character that had so much depth that I was willing him to exist in real life. The love that blooms between Alex and Lena is so beautiful and innocent that it felt like the first new green blade of grass poking up out of the soil after a horrific forest fire. It was pure and simple in their own secret world of the abandon houses, but society made it forbidden and dangerous. With Lena's quest to find out what really happened to her mother, the knowledge that Invalids and their world exist on the other side of the government's fences, AND that the countdown until her treatment is loudly ticking by...you'll be on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens. I will tell you one thing I am incredibly glad of...there WILL BE a second installment! I didn't know that at the time I finished this book, and was in tears because of the ending and the thought that I wouldn't get to see what happened next...thankfully...there will be more!<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who loves love or just needs a great dystopian novel in their lives. I definitely plan on making this book a part of my re-read pile because it was just THAT GOOD.s love or just needs a great dystopian novel in their lives.

0240815807|5.0|OK. I'm a 5th year music student studying Music Production & Engineering and Performance, and so as this is my chosen career path (what else is there!) I hope to be fairly well-informed and have read and studied a fair amount on the subject. I've been an avid reader of SoundOnSound magazine and so when I saw this book I picked it up immediately.<br /><br />If you don't like reading long reviews, my conclusion is as follows - the best book in its field thus far, contains a wealth of *practical* information that you will constantly refer to, incredibly well thought-out structure (you can easily jump around), and all the concepts are clearly communicated (missing in many books).<br /><br />My initial concerns were that the book seemed to target only the \\"small studio\\", and I was looking for something more professional. However, though it is intended for the smaller studio it should be noted that the end goal is to truly reach *commercial quality mixes*. The concepts are presented in such a concise and clear manner that even the 'basics' I felt comfortable with became even clearer, reinforcing my existing groundwork - both on a conceptual and practical level. There are many more 'advanced' concepts that are presented, again all in a practical fashion, that I had never thought of and I am already using in many of my mixes. In this way, I would wholeheartedly recommend this book even to someone who has been mixing for some time.<br /><br />The book contains many quotes relevant to the topic being discussed from some of the top mix engineers in the world, which is always interesting and even reassuring. After reading the book, one begins to appreciate just how much goes into creating world class mixes - and though the task can initially seem daunting, it becomes quite uplifting and inspiring knowing that even the greats spend so much time on the smallest things. I think of the quote of Mike Shipley discussing Mutt Lange's perfectionist (obsessive?!) approach to vocal EQ and automation [chapter 19].<br /><br />The book is revealing in the truest sense of the word. A must read for anyone genuinely interested in the art of mixing.

I am not trying to debate the merits of this book, only to say that I fully enjoyed reading it.
B0053TMP24|4.0|Obviously, most of the people who will purchase this book have read through the whole Percy Jackson series and the 1st installment of the Heroes of Olympus Series. Taking that into consideration, I will not go through a tiresome plot review as a plethora of other reviewers have already provided, and will undoubtedly provide it after my post.<br />THE BOOK<br />THE GOOD: The new major characters introduced are very interesting.  Both Hazel and Frank have strong back stories with dark undertones.  Putting bits of Chinese Mythology was also a surprise, though one cannot shake the feeling that the author might be laying plot elements for a possible tie-up with his other series, The Kane Chronicles (as it always hints on).<br />THE BAD: The plot was fine but not surprising. What shocked me more than the \\"I've-read-this-somewhere-else\\" plot twists was an  inconsistency that was in the book (so as not to spoil anything, I'll be quite cryptic: How the Giant of the North was defeated / the prerequisites of how to defeat a giant).  The Percy Jackson series was tight with the rules of the world set by the author, so it came as a surprise that the spin-off was a bit off.<br />THE UGLY: The author has decided not to reveal new prophecies in full.  It made me feel like he was not doing it to excite the reader, but rather, he has not decided what to do in the next book yet so he's keeping his options open.<br />THE E-BOOK STRUCTURE<br />There are typographical errors everywhere.  I have a gut feel the publisher/Amazon will release an edited version sooner as a lot of reviewers complain about the same thing.  As of this writing, the version is riddled with unintentional paragraph breaks and missing \\"spaces\\" from words that distract the readers from the flow of the story.  If you are the type who gets easily sidetracked by these typos, I suggest for you to wait for the release of the updated version (if they will be releasing it).<br />THE SERIES IN GENERAL<br />I started out Percy Jackson quite late.  I bought the whole series and read through it.  Suffice to say, it was OK.  It was a far cry from other recent YA series \\"greats\\" like Harry Potter, His Dark Materials, Hunger Games and Artemis Fowl.  But it was a notch higher compared to other mainstream YA hits (which I still do not understand where the hype came from) like The Inheritance Cycle, The Secret Life of Nicholas Flammel, The Lorien Legacies, Twilight and Cirque Du Freak (the better being mentioned first, succeeding, getting worse).<br />What lacked for me in the 1st series was the depth on the characters.  Unlike the previous \\"recent YA greats\\" I've mentioned, the main characters in the PERCY JACKSON series did not seem to develop any semblance to \\"maturity\\".  Through all the battles, sacrifices and hardships the main characters have faced, they only seemed to have brief moments of epiphany , then go back to their previous reckless juvenile banters.  The author also puts in whimsical imageries that are sometimes too much, leaving the general feel of the whole series being too comical for the reader to take anything from it seriously.<br />The 2nd Series started off with a premise that the author has decided to mature the tone.  New characters like Jason Grace, Leo and Pipper had more serious back issues which have been exposed by the author in a great fashion. But as I have mentioned, the author can't seem to decide if he will progress to a much darker feel as he keeps abruptly cutting serious scenes with off-handed juvenile repartees.<br />The Son of Neptune seemed to have continued his try on introducing new characters with profound past experiences.  But like in the 1st installment, he hastily cuts dark expositions of the character's soul with random things which becomes a bit tiresome when you reach around half of the book.<br />It is also obvious that unlike in the 1st series where things \\"just happen\\" out of plot necessity, the author is trying to inject plot elements he willlater use in future installments.  Again, his attempts are pretty much noticeable.  This includes the \\"open-ended prophecies\\" where you feel like the author does not know what to do with the next book yet.<br />All in all, The Heroes of Olympus is still a good read if you want to pass time and if you want to update yourself with the current pop culture.  Shall I purchase the succeeding installments? Yes.  Will this series become a classic? Yes. Is this a great literary masterpiece? I still have not decided yet.his attempts are pretty much noticeable.  This includes the \\"open-ended prophecies\\" where you feel like the author does not know what to do with the next book yet.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Forget what all the fan boys say, this collection is awesome. This is a must have for any Star Wars fan. The picture is crisp an the sound is stunning. But what really makes this set great are the bonus features. Endless hours of behind the scenes shots and countless interviews make The Complete Saga the essential piece to a Star Wars collection.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|* DISC ONE: The Next Doctor...  Very good story.  Kinda hokey, at times.  The backstory was a little rough around the edges.  The Cyber King's 'transport device' looked like it came off of the movie set of either The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen (Sean Connery) or Wild Wild West (Will Smith).  NOTE: I loved both of those movies.  Having both Doctors not recognize each other was a situation that begged for an explanation and we weren't forced to wait too long.  That explanation was delivered with an unexpected twist, of course.  * DISC TWO: Planet of the Dead...  Another very good story.  The baddies were cool, even if we never learned whether they were sentient (thus evil) or hive-like (simply 'misunderstood').  Funny note...in real life, the bus got severely damaged while in transit to the filming location.  Rather than ship a second bus, the writers/crew/cast used the broken one but added a line or two of dialogue to explain its scruffiness.  * DISC THREE: The Waters of Mars...  Pretty Good story.  Loved the concept.  Seemed to be directed well.  Buuut, kinda lost its pizzazz somewhere in editing.  And on a technical note: Mars has much lower gravity than Earth (one-sixth), but there was no explanation about why the Mars-bound characters had Earth-type gravity on a planet the size of Earth's moon.  Even if they had a gravity-field generator, which all Sci-Fi shows do, that doesn't explain why the Doctor enjoyed full-on 1G when he made the long walk from the TARDIS to the humans' base.  * DISC FOUR & FIVE: The End of Time, part 1 & 2...  Wow!  Just...wow!...in a good way, of course!!  Lots of action, time-play, life-n-death moments, Time Lord meddling (Timothy Dalton), old faces revisited, and of course regular folks (a/k/a victims).  Because I had a damaged DVD (explained below), I missed a few important facts from the end of part 1.  Even so, the show was awesome!  I'm a little miffed at Amazon.com because disc four has 2 really bad scratches.  They happened because the disc rubbed/pressed up against another DVD in the same case.  Because of that, I missed 'Part One' from the 45-minute point onward.  Roughly the last 15-20 minutes had to be endured in an infuriating self-stopping/starting/pausing mode that was also chock full of horrendous pixelations and countless soundtrack/picture mismatches.  PLUS...large gaps of unseen/unseeable footage.  I tried it in 3 different DVD players, including my laptop's, so it's definitely the DVD that's bad.  Thankfully, Amazon.com has an awesome replacement policy!!!!  UPDATE 10/12/11 - The replacement arrived today.  Its speedy arrival was both surprising and pleasing.  Amazon.com gets an A+ on this one!!

0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire caught me by surprise several times with the many twists and unexpected turns it takes, leading the reader on a continuous adventure.  The second book in The Hunger Games series starts out at a mild pace but quickly gains speed as Katniss and Peeta head out on their victory tour.  President Snow has told Katniss to calm the people in the districts but they see Katniss as an inspiration and the mockingjay has become their symbol of rebellion.  Katniss just wants to protect her family and do as she is told but things quickly spiral out of control and Katniss finds herself back in competition fighting for her life.<br /><br />My son and I read this book in tandem, each with our own copy, talking about it everyday.  My favorite memory reading Catching Fire is sitting on the patio swing with my son on a Sunday afternoon reading it quietly together.  Another fun memory is when he was reading it in the car and at a stoplight I was reading over his shoulder, when the book revealed a secret I hadn't yet read.  I love that this series by Collins reaches across generations and I can't wait to read the third book, Mockingjay, with my son. This book is not just for teenagers!<br /><br />Katniss is one powerful young woman, capable of more than she gives herself credit for.  Peeta is a inspiring, selfless young man who is smart on his feet.  Suzanne Collins has created a unique cast of characters who instantly challenge you to search for their particular attributes and not judge them by their appearance.  Catching Fire has a lot to offer to its readers as it is packed full of adventure, suspense, tainted love, confusion, violence and survival.  It is Survivor reality show meets Ancient Roman Gladiators wrapped up in a novel that is sure to keep you reading late into the night.
0370313968|5.0|I seem to be one of the few human beings alive today that has not been well educated on the era of King Henry VIII of England.  My wife and I had recently finished watching all the seasons of the TV show, \\"The Tudors\\" and, while enjoyable to watch, I had heard that the show was not all that historically accurate.  Coincidentally, this book, \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\" had been sitting on my bookshelves since the early 1990s when my wife bought it.  So, I decided to give it a go.<br /><br />I'm very glad I did for it is written very well and provides many details that, of course, the TV show could not include.  I read this book over quite a long time, as I tend to do for long nonfiction reads but it always kept my interest.  It certainly provides numerous details, almost too many sometimes, but reads more like the story of those years rather than a textbook.  The reader certainly gets a lot of information about the King himself, but it is important to realize this book is about the wives and, particularly their influence on the King and his policies as well as the other way around.  Thus the book does not end with Henry's death for there is still much to relate about his final wife, Katherine Parr.<br /><br />All in all, an enjoyable and informative reading experience.  And now I feel like I need to read more of this history, especially the details of Henry's children, Mary, Elizabeth, and Edward.  I suppose that's how people get hooked on it all.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|If you are a human being, you need to to see this movie! It not only shows the illegal actions of the billionaire bankers and how they set up people who could not afford huge house loans to take them anyway by approving people who were not credit worthy as they wanted to get the commissions for selling more loans. It also goes into some details about the credit default swaps (but you should go to PBS.org and see their Frontline series expose entitled 'The Warning,' to see more about that -you can do that for free online), and other things about the bankers that are very accurate, and need to be known so you can predict for yourself where the economy is going, who is to blame and why it is happening. The failure and crash of 2008 are not over yet. That was only a partial deflation of a couple of the credit and stock market bubbles, with more yet to come.   The Bankers cost the world 20 Trillion dollars, and they have not yet been brought under control by government regulations to make their totally absurd processes illegal due to pressure from them and the Tea Party to keep 'free market capitalism' which in effect means:  \\"Let the SOB's do whatever they will, we trust the market to correct everything perfectly.\\" Unfortunately, the market does not react fast enough to stop huge irresponsibility from destroying our economic system before it happens (it is also not perfect like God, as some fanatical pro-capitalism advocates seem to think it is - another misplaced faith!). For more on this see \\"The Warning\\" mentioned above, it documents not only how Alan Greenspan actually told a regulator under him to not even prosecute outright cases of fraud as he thought the market would correct itself and fix the problem. He also later admitted he was wrong about that, and that banking institutions Do require some government oversight and regulations.  This and other sources such as Aftershock [[ASIN:0470918144 Aftershock: Protect Yourself and Profit in the Next Global Financial Meltdown]](two books by the same name, both excellent)[[ASIN:0307476332 Aftershock: The Next Economy and America's Future (Vintage)]] point out that neither political party can take all the blame for this fiasco. Not only did Reagan and Bush 'give away' the bank by ending regulations, so did Clinton. The lessons are many, and different people may arrive at different conclusions than mine, but everyone should see this movie to be better informed about the biggest event in recent history (and yes, this was more important and impactful than the attack of 9/11 or the wars we are in, once you understand the real scope of this, and that it has not reached it's conclusion yet!)
B005CM9DX6|3.0|As an avid Opeth listener and long-time fan, the fact that Mikeal Akerfeldt bypassed the traditional death metal elements of the sub-genre in favor of all \\"clean\\" vocals, less harsh/heavy guitar overdrive, and the introduction of non-traditional rock/metal instrumentation is no surprise to me, given Mike's background musical taste (70s prog and 60s pop) and especially given Opeth's 2001 experiment with something remotely similar in Damnation. Damnation didn't have any of the death metal \\"growls\\" or \\"roars\\" on it (some have also called them \\"Cookie Monster vocals\\"). Damnation likewise abandoned a heavier guitar in favor of clean channel and acoustic playing. The tempo was slowed, and keyboards were introduced for the first time as a major component of the record. But the record still retained the trademark Opeth \\"darkness\\" to it. Here with Heritage, we see even more experimentation with the introduction of flutes, (more) piano, softer guitar work, non-metal beats, etc. I'm not surprised this record is so different from the rest of Opeth's discography (Damnation aside). Moreover, I think this record is a step in the right direction for Mike personally, as he is aging (38 years old), and has been \\"growling\\" and playing progressive metal for more than half his life professionally. As with anyone who nears their mid-life, a change in direction was in order.  The record is refreshing to me so long as I distance myself from the Opeth brand name. Assuming this is Mike's exploration into... something else... it makes sense. As an Opeth record? Well, for those fans who are more accustomed to their faster, heavier, darker albums, Heritage may disappoint. In listening to metal for over 20 years, I always chuckle when metal fans hear a saxophone or something other than a traditional guitar/drum lineup and make all kinds of poor comparisons. Fans of Heritage have been calling this record as some sort of modern throwback to 70s era King Crimson, forcing me to conclude one of two things: 1) the listener doesn't know 70s era King Crimson, or 2) the person listened to some other record besides Heritage. Believe me, it sounds nothing like 70s-era King Crimson, or Jethro Tull, or any of the great 70s prog bands.  What you DO hear in this record, however, is more experimental rock than you might hear elsewhere, especially coming from Opeth. Opeth's traditional \\"darkness\\" is still here, even in the quieter, softer moments. Care has been taken in developing transitions that keep the listener engaged, but aren't gratuitous. The placement of jazz instruments like the flute is done with care, and it comes off sounding excellent in places. Mike's voice likewise has come a long way, and shows more maturity here than it did on Damnation.  Some criticism is in order as well. I think the track \\"Slither,\\" a tribute of sorts to the late Ronnie James Dio, is actually somewhat comical in the middle of such a serious album. I actually laughed when I heard the opening guitar lick, clicked past it, and haven't really looked back. I suppose Mike has enough gusto at this point in his career that most producers would say \\"GOOD IDEA, SIR!\\" if he asked for something absurd on a record, and that's the feeling I get with \\"Slither.\\" Perhaps it should have been retained as a b-side or a bonus track. With that said, I do believe \\"Pyre\\" is an excellent track and would have seamlessly replaced Slither with ease. However, \\"Pyre\\" is only be available to those who buy the 2 disc version as an extra track on the DVD, and because of the nature of compressed audio on all DVDs (AC3), hearing \\"Pyre\\" in a pure lossless manner will have to wait until some other release in the future, or never at all. Regardless, it is one of Opeth's best bonus tracks. The rest of the songs are not new for Opeth as far as changing up tempos and arrangements, but they are over all more experimental. I especially like I Feel the Dark, Haxprocess, and Folklore.  On the production, from a mixing standpoint,the drum cymbals over the whole album I felt were too high in the mix. Sometimes the crash decay is quite long and loud at places. Some of the more rustic elements of a pseudo-live recording are extant as well. However, this gives the album an earthy tone and feel. For example, with some decent audio equipment, during the opening track \\"Heritage\\" one can hear the foot pedals on the piano and the gentle clicking sounds of fingernails on the keys. The guitar licks haven't been re-worked with computers to the point that they're not hardly recognizable as guitars anymore (ala Ghost Reveries in places). While the dynamic range of the album is better than most metal albums today, one need only consider that this isn't really a metal album, so naturally being somewhat \\"quieter\\" than most of the metal genre, its average dynamic range will be a bit richer. Regardless, I don't think I spotted any compression or clipping, or at least any that stands out in a big way like it does at nearly every moment of the Blackwater Park album (Opeth's most compressed/clipped album to date). In that sense, the production was done fairly well, but I have heard better.  Bottom line: if you liked Damnation (and don't be ashamed to admit that you did), give Heritage a spin. There's a lot here to love, despite it being quite a departure for Opeth in so many ways.
B001BYXO7K|5.0|It is nice to have the option to preload batteries in for a quick change.  It is not clear that the magazine system is that much faster than dumping out four batteries and putting in new ones in an arrangement such as the Canon 580EXII has, but if you are in a low light situation without a flashlight, the magazine is a quick easy solution.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|I  love the CD, especially the track YOU AND I, which makes me want to sing, saw it performed on THE VIEW, and just had to have it.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|I found that this movie was entertaining. Not scary at all but definitely entertaining. It started out slow to introduce the characters and builds up the situation that is their demon friend. The Characters develop through their last few days and then all hell breaks loose. I feel like this is a horror movie I could watch as a child. All the so called horror movies today are all gore factor, thus I call them Gorror movies. This movie has no gore and provided the audience some jumps and me some laughs. Not a bad movie but some people would rather be gored out than horrored out. Plain and simple the movie builds up to a climax of a haunted house.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|Just discovered Florence recently. Oh my! So wonderful and unique. My favorites are Rabbit Heart and You Got the Love but the whole album is just stunning. Thankfully I can buy their next release straight away. 5 out of 5 stars.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|This prequel/ last 5 min sequal should have stopped when it had the chance. I am not against prequals. I am not for them either. But when I saw the first one I enjoyed it. This one plays off those same tricks with a different part of the family. It was a foretelling that prequals were going to come after even this one. Same material, same family. Stick with the first one.

1935670913|5.0|John Locke is a person of interest because of his outstanding success in selling eBooks. In this book, he shares his marketing strategy and I would encourage every author to not only read it but to study it. John has a lot of great ideas for reaching people, one at a time or, in some cases, a hundred at a time. Regardless, his method works and you owe it to yourself to check it out.<br /><br />However, this book is not only of value to indie publishers; it would come in handy for authors publishing through mainstream channels as well. After all, when you take the time to interact with your readers, it makes all the difference in the world.<br /><br />This book reaches readers at their own level - regardless of what that level may be. John Locke has a way of instilling confidence, despite the challenges ahead. He will tell you himself that, if you want a get-rich-quick scheme, this is not the book for you. In fact, his strategy takes a tremendous amount of energy and hard work, but the rewards surpass anything I know.
B002ZG97RY|5.0|Green Zone is an awesome film about Iraq during the massive hunt for Weapons of Mass Destruction and the lies that followed.   First of all, let me say that I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan.  I've been in operations, talk to the locals, and am generally familiar with all the military technology and terminology.  In other words, I can relate to the film (been there done that).  The movie was pretty close to reality ... with some Hollywood touch.  The action was great and Matt Damon certainly played the part.  I've read some of the other reviews and I think it is more of a \\"I can't relate\\" mentality.  I read some reviews about the camera shaking ... I didn't even notice it.  I think it is more about the fact that if a person can't relate, they are more likely to look for flaws.  If I could give this movie 7 stars, I would.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|I used a computer stand similar to this one (with a 13\\" Macbook) at a place of employment. When I needed my own, I started looking through my options and decided to go with this Griffin stand. I have a 15\\" MacBook Pro, and this stand works perfectly for it. The height is not adjustable, but at 5'3\\" the height is great for me. When my 6' husband tried it out, it was great for him too. My laptop gets hot, so I appreciate the way that air is allowed to circulate all the way around the computer. It is also not bulky or an eyesore. In fact, I think it's barely noticeable on my desk. I can stuff my keyboard underneath it when I want to use more desk space. I also greatly appreciate that it can be easily disassembled for storage or packing if I need to relocate it.  Several of the reviews that I read mentioned that the stand loses its grip after a while. The one at work that I used previously never lost its grip even after several years of use. Having said that, I was still a bit concerned. BUT when this shipment came, there are two small clips that attach to the ends of the top of the stand that should prevent the laptop from sliding off. Griffin must have listened to its customers and made this improvement. Kudos for that, Griffin. The only issue for me is that my CD insertion point is on the front right side, and one of the clips impedes the ease of use. I rarely use the drive, though, so it's a non-issue for me. If I were inserting and ejecting CDs all day, though, I would probably just not use the clip.  Overall, a great buy and reasonably priced.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|Okay so there's a lot of good here, with some very annoying bad. I'd say it is definitely worth a purchase, especially if you consider yourself a pretty fervent Star Wars fan like myself.  Pros:  - Incredible video quality. The films have never ever looked better, even when compared to the hi-def versions that have been airing on television as of late. They weren't lying when they said that you would see a lot more of every frame -- I've noticed little background details that I've never come across before in my life. Exceptional stuff.  - Sound is fantastic, THX went through and recorded a brand new audio track for like the 15th time and it really shines in surround.  - The deleted scenes, in my honest opinion, are worth the $80 alone. Come on people! This is stuff we've only dreamed about having up until now.  - The rest of the special features are pretty solid, would have loved to have seen rarer or more brand new documentaries, but the 'collection' stuff is fantastic.  - Just knowing that you have the veritable 'Complete Star Wars Saga' in your possession. My eight-year-old self would be flipping out.  Cons:  - The latest additions. I have a feeling that they'll grow on me a bit, like the '97 and '04 additions, but for now they stick out like a gross sore thumb. [Noooo!!!]  - Again, I can't help but feel like there was a missed opportunity on the last special features disc ... the random sw-inspired clips from TV felt a bit unnecessary.  - The packaging is just ab-so-lutely god awful. Terrible water colored paintings in some dumb book setup. Han with Ewoks... Boba riding that weird dinosaur from Ep. 3... that horribly assembled collage of characters? WTF?! It blows my mind that this stuff got approved. I'd probably pay another $80 to have a better case to put my discs in. :/  Final Thoughts: Loathe it for the oft-terrible prequels, superfluous additions, and shockingly horrendous packaging. Love it for the original trilogy looking and sounding so magnificent, a handful of fantastic special features, and the holy grail that is the deleted scenes.  Overall Rating: 8.6/10
B0015UWODA|5.0|Nothing is off limits in this collection of essays.  Sedaris let us into the world of department store elves, most of whom should not be anywhere near children in the SantaLand Diaries essay.  Seasons Greetings is Sedaris' answer to those wretched holiday newsletters bragging about how great everything is for everyone complete with family photos of everyone in their matching holiday outfits.  Holiday pageants and their butchering by teachers are the subject of Front Row Center.  Religious zealots and rich yuppies also get their own essays.   Even though there are only 6 essays in this book, all are funny.  You'll be grossed out by some, but what's a David Sedaris book without some gross out humor.  Chances are you probably know people who closely resemble those being mocked in this collection.    Perfect for those who loathe the Christmas music on the radio starting November 1st and store displays in the middle of summer.  This collection is one that I re-read every Christmas season and treasure along with the annual Christmas Story marathon on tv.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|The action on this game is inexcusable. No wonder it us selling at a reduced price right now! Transitions are slow, selecting your card is a pain, &amp; countering an opponent with the same card is even worse.

B005MVIF7M|5.0|It must be difficult, as artist/singer/songwriters, to live in the shadow of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, which is truly one of the great albums that, despite all the praise it's received, has never been overrated.  A Ghost Is Born took a brilliant sidestep, Sky Blue Sky mixed in the jam band mentality without becoming boring, and Wilco (the album) was as beautifully concise as they've been since A.M.<br /><br />But The Whole Love...<br /><br />The Whole Love is bookended by marathon tracks, leaving the ten remaining tracks free to be concise.  As good as they've ever been, The Whole Love highlights the clever layering that has been Wilco's bread and butter, and in addition to this being the album of the year, it just may be the best album in several years, up there with All In Good Time (BnL), Accelerate (R.E.M.), Saturday Nights and Sunday Mornings (Counting Crows), and Forget And Not Slow Down (Relient K).

0307987647|5.0|This is Book Two of the Song of Fire and Ice series, one of the best epic fantasy tales I've ever seen.  I have all the books and read them straight through, but my husband travels so much with his job so he has no time at all to sit and read.  This is why he likes audio books and this series has caught his interest, too.  We both watched HBO's \\"Game of Thrones\\" and fell in love with it, and for once, the transition from written word to screen was well done.  A spectacular story wonderfully told on the audio books.  This is fantasy for people who don't ordinarily read fantasy books.  It's an epic story of war and the clash of 5 kings, all vying for the Iron Throne to rule the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.  Excellent characters, intriguing plotlines, this story has it all.

B004LWZW4C|5.0|X-men first class is one of the best prequels I've ever seen.  It's very true to the movies that follow it, chronologically.  It's also a very compelling movie that tells a story of how the protagonists in the later movies came to be the way the are.  Please, someone send this to George Lucas in case he decides to make another prequel.
B000I0QM0E|5.0|Watching Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow every October has become a family tradition for us. Just the right amount of creepiness, gore and humor to set the mood for Halloween. While it's not suitable for very young children, it's a classic that older kids won't outgrow. When I discovered that one of my kids swiped the DVD we had for years when she went off to college, I had just to replace and upgrade to the HD--it just wouldn't be Halloween without it!

B0050PYNP8|4.0|This movie has some hilarious moments, especially if you are a fan of sci-fi movies, and even more especially if you are a fan of alien movies. It alternates between spoofing (affectionately) and paying homage to many classics, including of course all the biggies - E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Star Wars, Star Trek, Aliens, etc.. It is kind of like what Scream is to horror movies in that sense, but much smarter in most parts. I say 'most parts' because it also has some of the lower gross-out humor that the director (Greg Mottola of Superbad) and the star (Seth Rogan) are known for in other material, and that's not really my favorite kind of comedy. So this film worked best for me when it was in its smarter, referential/spoofing mode.<br /><br />The plot centers around a U.S. road trip by two Brits (played by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost), to Comic-Con (the ultimate sci-fi/comic book convention) and then to various UFO sighting spots around the southwest (Roswell, etc.) Along the way they encounter Paul, the alien voiced by Seth Rogan. They also pick up Kristin Wiig, playing a Christian Fundamentalist (which enables some creationist vs. evolutionist humor) and are chased by 'men in black' headed up by Jason Batemen. All the performances are great.<br /><br />It does drag in parts, so that is why for me it's a 4 not a 5 star (in addition to not being a fan of the gross-out sections.) But overall, this is a great, funny movie for anyone that likes sci-fi and/or Seth Rogan type humor. If not, it might not be for you.
159562015X|3.0|The content of this book is very good.  I like the fact that it is positive and looks for what's right with people.  Being a problem solver is a great attribute but if all we do is focus on our problems, we aren't developing what's right with us and should be strengthened.  The downside of this book is that I bought it used.  It has a code that can only be used by one person so I won't be able to take the assessment online which is the real purpose of this book, finding your own strengths.  I wish I had bought it new.

I was going to get it because of the neat features it showed, but there wasn't as many as I thought.. People have said that Amazon is a bit behind on this app, so I guess I'll be waiting..

B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I'm going to take the unusual step of stating the worst thing about this film at the very beginning. It is exactly the same as every other boxing/sport movie out there. The only thing different is the gimmick of having a robot as the fighter and the main character as the trainer. Having said that, on to the good things. As far as gimmicks go this one isn't bad. The concept may sound silly but what it allows for is giving the kid a major role in the film. This film is really about a father/son relationship. A VERY strained one too. Hugh Jackman hasn't seen his kid in years (since birth in fact) and when he gets custody of him after the mother's death his first act is to sell him to the kid's aunt for enough money to buy a new robot to train. Now in a film like this there would usually be very little for the kid to do. He would fill essentially the same role as the romantic interest, just being there to show the main character's human side. In this film the kid has a major role. He's the one who finds the robot and he's the one whose drive carries the plot forward. The robot boxing is almost secondary to the growing father/son bond.<br /><br />As might be obvious from the section above, the entire film rests on how well the father/son relationship works. With Hugh Jackman being a known factor it all rests on the choice of kid. Fortunately they chose well. I'm always a little finicky about child actors. They tend to either underplay or overplay their parts. Fortunately, the only overacting here comes in the context of the matches themselves where the characters are supposed to be performing and not simply reacting. The kid is a real find and manages to pull off strong willed without coming off as just stubborn. Hugh Jackman is excellent as usual as the impulsive and absentee father. His character is really a prick in the beginning having no obvious redeeming factors. As with all stories of this sort he's had a change of heart by the end, but the change comes gradually and doesn't feel forced. It helps that his son is an awful lot like him, which makes it easy to see why the two would bond.<br /><br />Other reviews have said that this is the movie that [[ASIN:B000VR0570 Transformers]] should have been, and there's a lot of truth to that. The man/machine interactions capture a fair amount of wonder and they never seem fake. Each bot has a unique appearance making it easy to tell them apart, unlike the previously mentioned film. The robots look real, and there were never any moments where you doubted that the characters were interacting with them. I feel that this was due to the use of a large number of practical effects instead of relying solely on cgi. What I really respected about this film was the way that it managed to capture all of the standard moments of this genre without hitting all of the cliches. There were many moments that I was waiting for with great non-anticipation but which never showed up. While the outcome of the film is never really in doubt the way in which the film gets there is very well handled. That said one or two of the characters were pretty stereotypical. The vile redneck Southerner is just an overused cliche by this point and the rich, evil foreigners vs. the small, underdog Americans has been done to death in so many movies.<br /><br />So in conclusion: This film adds nothing new to the sporting genre. It is basically the same story done a thousand times before. But while it may not be original it makes up for it by having a lot of heart and telling the same old story with a great deal of skill. The acting is excellent as are the effects. And the robot fights are quite thrilling. Coming to this movie with an open mind I was impressed at how well it all fit together in one entertaining package. Despite operating on what seems like a cheap gimmick it managed to mine that idea for all the dramatic potential it had. And the result is impressive.t feel forced.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Other reviewers have said all there is to say about the story, so I just wanted to add another 5 star rating. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hope that we will soon have the continuation or an entirely new book to enjoy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I started with a trial version of the first book and was hooked long before I reached the end.  I subsequently purchased the Trilogy and have not been disappointed.  The books are fast moving with good characterization and reasonably believable premises.  I, literally, couldn't put it down as I couldn't wait to see what happened next.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys fast moving fiction.
1401207529|5.0|I really enjoyed this graphic novel, that's COMIC BOOK to everyone who remembers when they used to cost ten cents for one issue. 25 cents for a GIANT book. It's a good read, with a great deal of references to plots in BATMAN BEGINS.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|The Pacific is very good,  but lacking compared to Band of Brothers. The individual interests not as good,  but I am into WWII anyway.
0896898288|4.0|I read some negative reviews about this book due to the way the templates were stored but I have been quite satisfied. The books itself is a delightful read and a very nice book for gifting or coffee table display. Accessing the templates is commonsense, easy to do on a mac or PC. As long as your printer is configured correctly, each template prints to scale and you can increase it by whatever amount to make a bigger block if desired. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I would like to be able to print more than one template per page, so save paper. I am confident I could do it with a wee bit of copy and paste but the jury is still out on the efficacy of that idea.

As a bootcamp fan, I've done a fair amount of resistance training and this book has complemented my knowledge really well in that the variety of exercises is great as well the number of exercises for each muscle group. Really good book, thoroughly recommend.

B002ZG99TK|2.0|Tony Scott is much better than this.  He has produced many great movies but this one was just ok in my opinion.  The title basically tells you about what you are going to watch leaving little to really see.  Maybe a different title and few adjustments here or there could have made it better.  Overall, if your a Denzel Washington fan for sure worth a watch but look towards 'The Last Boy Scout' or 'The Taking of Pelham 123' for a better Tony Scott production.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller

B005COO1X6|2.0|You'd be hard pressed to find a more dedicated and loyal Stephen King fan than me, which is why it pains me to write this review. I really wanted to love this book. It had all the creepy \\"monster car\\" appeal of From a Buick 8, but the plot. It just petered out way before it had a chance to get interesting. And the ending felt really tacked on. All in all, this short story felt like more of an advertisement for King's upcoming 11/22/63. Looking forward to that book, but as a longtime fan of King's short stories, I know he's capable of far better. If this had been tossed into one of his collections, I might not care as much, but for $2.99, I expect more from my favorite author.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|Which is why I liked it.  A good parody is hard to make, this one fires on both two stroke cylinders.  I took a chance and rented this and was not disappointed.  I've recommended this film to others in my family who share an appreciation of black comedy.

B005FISBTO|5.0|The sixth Season of DEXTER is now two episodes old and the changes in the writing and casting are remarkable. Dexter's on is now two years old and is gaining in significance to his father's thought processes.  There are some interesting suggestions that this season will explore the opposite side of dark - the world of faith and 'religion' will be part of the running stories.  Already there is a new 'team' of fellow travelers in the serial killing industry in the characters played by Edward James Olmos and Colin Hanks.  Lt. Maria LaGuerta (Lauren V&eacute;lez), now divorced from Sgt. Angel Batista (David Zayas), has become a Captain, Dexter' sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter) has a falling out with Quinn (Desmond Harrington) and becomes the new Lieutenant, taking LaGuerta's old spot, and Dexter (Michael C. Hall), though a bit more thoughtful than in previous seasons, continues to perform his serial rituals, aided by his ghost father's (James Remar) guidance.<br /><br />There are enough subplots established in these first two episodes to make for another fascinating season.  Dexter returns, just a bit different, but still challenging our senses!  Stay tuned. Grady Harp, October 11
B002QYNIHU|2.0|I'm a mom of a 6 yr old boy... my son loves Dragonball Z, so I thought it will be a great gift for his Kindergarten graduation on June 2011.  He was thrilled to see it in the small box when it arrived in.  But as soon as we opened it, we tried to attach the different pieces... but they kept on falling apart.  Figure is very fragile... Attachments all fall apart easily.  I bought this the end of May and it's now October 2011 and head attachment piece broke and now cannot be attach.  What a waste of money... Extremely disappointed!
B004HW7JMO|4.0|Any review of Starz's mini-series prequel \\"Spartacus:  Gods of the Arena\\" must start with its tragic inspiration.  Andy Whitfield, star \\"Spartacus:  Blood and Sand,\\" had to take a break before filming the second season to battle cancer, a battle that he tragically lost.  Starz decided to film this six-episode prequel in the hopes that he would be back to film the second season.  Despite this sad foundation, in many ways this season is better than the first.  In large part that is because the story largely focuses on Batiatus (John Hannah), the gladiator factory owner who will train and ultimately betray Spartacus.  In this prequel, Batiatus is merely the custodian of his father's school and chafes under his father's conservative thinking.  The school is second-rate, but Batiatus and his friend Solonius (Craig Walsh-Wrightson) are ambitious men.  One of the treats of this mini-series is to watch the birth of the rivalry between Batiatus and Solonius that moves so much of Season One.  John Hannah turns Batiatus into a wonderful character, an ambitious cockroach of a man whom you can't help loving just a bit because . . . well, because he's played by John Hannah.  Batiatus is married to Lucretia (Lucy Lawless), a Roman Lady MacBeth if there ever was one.  Watching these two climb the social ladder is a terrific joy, particularly as they are aided by Gaia (Jaime Murray), a hedonist even by Roman standards.    We also learn the backstories of several of the gladiators.  Oenomaus (Peter Mensah), the instructor in Season One, is still a gladiator but has lost his status as champion due to the wounds from his legendary fight.  Instead, Gannicus (Dustin Clare) is champion as well as a charming drunk.  Crixus (Manu Bennett) is a mere recruit but wants nothing more than to take Gannicus down . . . that is, until Lucretia turns her eyes on him.  And on and on.  These back stories are handled well - good scenes but the action never gets bogged down in too much exposition.  For there are only two reasons why \\"Spartacus:  Blood and Sand\\" became a surprise hit for Starz:  blood and sex.  There is enough death and dismemberment in \\"Gods of the Arena\\" to satisfy even the most jaded \\"Saw\\" fan, and, well, let's just say that there's more full monty here than in \\"The Full Monty.\\"  At only six episodes, \\"Gods of the Arena\\" moves quickly through its paces, but the amount of story feels right.  Here's hoping that this cast and crew has seen all the tragedies that it will face and that only bright, bloody days are in store.
B00466HN86|5.0|Each movie that they make gets better and better.  I was so amazed. Lots of humor and you need lots of kleenex.  I would go to see it again.  Had to go out of town to see it.  Wished our movie theater here in Marshfield would carry it.  Will be a movie I will defiantly own. If fathers really followed this and the wives were there for their husbands we would see a changed world.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Really a good movie.  Scary that there are people out there like this, but there are.  Wont' say too much, but it's a good action movie!
B005974CNA|5.0|Put simply, the Dream Theater I fell in love with back when they released Images and Words has returned! And I hate saying that with the lack of Portnoy in the equation, but it's crazy for me to think these guys are as different as they are between this album with Mangini and their last with Portnoy. Where that's concerned, the title of the album couldn't be more appropriate.<br /><br />To start, I've been closely following Mangini since I saw him on tour with Vai in the late 90's. And while I have no interest in egging on the Portnoy vs. Mangini argument, I think that any informed drummer or musician who is familiar with the works of both will say that Mangini is a step UP for Dream Theater. If you don't know much about Mangini, look him up on YouTube and Wikipedia to see his long list of credentials. The only way it could have gotten any better, in my humble opinion, is if they had scored Bobby Jarzombek. That guy is a beast! But I digress.<br /><br />With that said, Mangini's compositional skills aren't made readily apparent on this album, as other reviewers have noted. Additionally, the drums are so far back in the mix of this album that what little Mangini does is overshadowed. As such, Mangini will likely find himself blowing unknowing people away with his live drum solos and ability to pull off even the most complex Portnoy chops. Is it bad to say that I hope this is the new Dream Theater for at least one more album? I want these guys to really gel while touring for this album, the come back and write the next album as a band. If the common denominator between such drastically different albums is Mike Portnoy, then I'm glad he's gone... and believe me when I say that I truly hate feeling that way. I don't have this animosity that others seem to towards Portnoy, but this album is a huge breath of fresh air as a long-time Dream Theater fan.<br /><br />Honestly, I had completely written Dream Theater off a couple of albums ago. I know that bands grow and change with time, but everything they did after SFAM stuck with me less and less. I just can't say enough about how pleasant of a surprise this album is for me! Petrucci sounds like he's just having more fun playing on this album than I've heard in a while. This whole album just sounds more creative and meaningful than the past few albums have.<br /><br />Right now, my favorite song on the whole album is \\"Lost Not Forgotten.\\" It's such a throwback to so many elements of classic Dream Theater composition that I can't listen to it without a smile on my face! The main solo passage towards the end reminds me so much of A Change of Seasons in so many ways... I just love it. This song is single-handedly everything a long-time Dream Theater fan craves. It's got the craziest instrumental sections, the most epic composition, the awesome Petrucci solo, etc. Though, with that said, there are plenty of amazing moments to behold in just about every song on this album.<br /><br />Oh, and when was the last time a Dream Theater album LITERALLY gave you chills? It's been a VERY long time for me, but this album managed to do it -- specifically, at exactly 9:00 in the song \\"Outcry.\\" Man, what an insanely beautiful passage (listen to it in a great set of headphones) -- especially coming out of the chaotic instrumental passage that precedes it. Yes, it's an incredibly simple passage, but it is the antithesis of everything I came to dislike about the band's compositions following SFAM.<br /><br />Anyway, I suppose I've rambled on enough. Long story short, if the Dream Theater you know is the Dream Theater from the past 3 or 4 albums, you may find yourself wondering what happened to the band. However, if you're like me and you've been following this band since the early days, prepare to call yourself a Dream Theater fan once again and feel the same sense of pride you used to when saying that!<br /><br />Things I'd like to see happen with this line-up on the next album:<br /><br />1 - Better mixing/mastering: With the exception of the clarity of guitars and keys, the overall mixing on this album is sorely lacking. If you're not an audiophile, you'll have no idea what I'm talking about. Those of you who are, though, will know *exactly* what I'm talking about. Why is Mangini so far back in the mix? Why do the kick drums sound so thin, like I'm listening to an album that was mixed for a 1990's cassette tape? There's a certain power that's lacking here, I feel. Regardless, this shouldn't stop you from buying this album. The wondrous music this band has created for this album outweighs the production woes, I think... Well, for the first 10-20 listens, at least. =)<br /><br />2 - Mangini's signature: What I mean by this is I'd like to hear Mangini really open the flood gates and let us hear his trademarks! This is a man who set multiple WFD records for his drumming and plays the absolutely insane drum section to Steve Vai's Fire Garden Suite that you can find on YouTube! There are a few tasty morsels on this album, but I'd like to hear MUCH more!<br /><br />So, that about does it for what I have to say. Now, go buy the album, listen to it at least 2 times before passing judgment on it, and come back here and share your thoughts! I've been enjoying reading all the reviews from fans just like me who have been waiting for an album like this to happen once again from these guys.<br /><br />Bravo, Dream Theater!!!mixing on this album is sorely lacking.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|Hubby and I became instant fans of this TV series and were disappointed when it was canceled after just 2 seasons, so we're glad it's available on DVD. We purchased both seasons. The DVDs play great and have nice extras with cast and crew. The series prompted us to read the books, which we're really enjoying.

1932735410|4.0|Hi Amazon  To be honest it is almost 90% the same as the sixth edition, the practice exam question are almost exactly the same only the order is different  Personally I passed my PMP exam in August 2011 using the sixth edition and I bought this book to upgrade my knowledge, but I have been reading up to chapter 8 now and so far I don't feel there is much new information  If you plan to pass the PMP exam and you have the required experience and took the required classes, then this book is the best tool to pass the exam, the way project management is explained in this book (and in the sixth edition) is amazing and improves your skills in analyzing and understanding the questions  I wish you good luck in passing the exam
B000FBJAOG|1.0|This book was recommended to me as I enjoy most zombie films.  I was grossly disappointed.  The reading level is grade-school, the material is repetitious, graphics provide further filler material, and the information provided is no more incisive than watching any zombie movie - even a bad \\"B movie\\" at that!    The tone of the book is not humorous, grotesque, frightening, clever, dramatic, serious, creepy or any other adjectives except... boring and bland.  Also, The author attempts to supply first-hand, historical accounts of zombie attacks, but the wording of the quoted passages is anachronistic and still within the writer's \\"voice.\\"    In sum, I learned nothing from this \\"survival guide\\" and I was not entertained in the least.
0375842209|5.0|In school we had an independent reading project but if u wanted you could read the book thief for more of a challenge. I chose to read the book thief. For most of the book it goes pretty slow, but don't let that fool you into thinking that its never going to be worth it. Well its worth it to read those not so interesting parts because the ending is so powerful it MAKES you cry even though you don't think its worth crying for. The way the words are written its like it pulls you into the book and you feel what the character in the book is feeling. A very very powerful book!!!! READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!
1401322425|4.0|If you watched the video \\"Jaime at Home\\" then you'll know the recipes in this book.  I bought it because it doesn't end after a video and it has more recipes than the video series indicates.  It's heavy on fresh, organic veggies from his garden - something I can't duplicate - but his \\"mash up\\" and cook on wood-burning oven style is just great. Anything cooked to correct done-ness on wood ovens is \\"the best\\".  I like the book and if you're interested in a lot of veggies, methods for cooking in wood ovens, making sauces with mortar-pestle, and some unexpectedly good soups/stews, this is a good buy.

I like having rich images in my mind while I'm reading things and this book kind of left me hanging. It seemed like several times the author would carry on a conversation between people that he had never described before so my imagination didn't really know what to create. Maybe it's just me but I definitely got bored and quit reading about 3/4 through
1903307902|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moYE6H464DKCK8]]THE DEFINITIVE TEXT ON EMPLOYMENT LAW FOR ADVISERS AND NON-LAWYERS TOO: NOW IN IT'S NINTH EDITION<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you're a practitioner preparing a case for an employment tribunal or representing your client, the new edition of `Employment Law' by Tamara Lewis should be your next must-have purchase.  Even if you are not a lawyer but advising a client, please note that this book is Claimant focussed and therefore relevant to you, whether you're an employee, or employer.<br /><br />Published by the ever reliable and knowledgeable Legal Action Group, this new edition offers literally a wealth of plain, practical, advice which should save you a lot of time and money in the event of a claim.  It should certainly steer you in the direction of what questions to ask your professional adviser.<br /><br />Since the publication of the previous edition, this new ninth edition contains vital new material on such issues as the Equality Act 2010, multiple discrimination, the consequences of the abolition of the default retirement age and the new rights relating to paternity leave.  There are new agency worker regulations which you've probably heard about - and, particularly if you are an employer, or in-house legal adviser, you should be aware of the new laws against the blacklisting of trade unionists.<br /><br />As Tamara Lewis points out, the practical emphasis of the book dictates that as much space is devoted to evidence, precedents and checklists as to setting out the law.  So usefully, there are ample resources for your further research, including index and appendices, together with tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and a table of European legislation.  The book is up to date as at August 2011.
B00001U0E1|5.0|This is a wonderful movie - It arrived from the seller as in the condition expected and more quickly than I expected it to arrive. I shared the movie with my high school student - There are a couple of rather explicit sex scenes - so if you plan to share with teens you will want to pre-view so you know when to skip ahead.
B00447G2PM|5.0|I got this movie for my  grand-daughters but I ended up likeing this movies 3d effcts  the best out of  all the 3d  we have gotten  so far.It was like the fish  were  at your  fingertips.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I was really looking forward to this book because of the positive prepub hype. The plot is really thin and could be summed up in one long sentence. What's going to happen is obvious very early on. The descriptions of the Night Circus are extremely evocative. That being said, those descriptions become redundant as the book goes on. The two primary characters show little growth or change and seem very one dimensional. Still, the book is an enjoyable read.
B003Z2LAAO|3.0|I  liked  the scenery  in this movie  and the  bubble 3d effects  in the opening credits..  but the movie  turns into a water concervation  story that just goes dry . But  the Grand canyon views  do  speak for them selves.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I wasn't a fan of the previous Harry Potter film because it was extremely shy on the actual magic and didn't contain enough action for my liking, but Deathly Hallows is a pretty remarkable improvement on *both* accounts.  To me the magical aspect of the Harry Potter series is a vital addition to the storytelling.  It really enhances the feeling of adventure.  I'm happy to report that it's back again, thankfully.  As expected by the title of the film alone, it's about Lord Voldemort attempting to officially capture and rid the world of Harry Potter once and for all.  Will he succeed?  That's definitely not for me to spoil, hehe.  The setting is quite the surprise as well.  Harry Potter and his friends almost never step foot inside a castle which makes the movie feel different, but not in a distracting kind of way or anything.  Most of the adventure takes places outside in the empty forests or occasionally in the city streets.  A major part of the storyline is on Harry Potter and the gang being cloned into lookalike Harry Potter's and being able to disappear whenever signs of danger present themselves (which is pretty much the norm by this point but used to great effect this time around).  Some of my favorite scenes are when Harry Potter was outside in the dark woods by himself and he spots a glowing, mystical deer walking around.  To me this was a *beautiful* moment of creativity.  Another really fascinating and bizarre moment of viewing material (and storytelling for that matter) came later when the story surrounding Death takes place and how Death tricks people into being loyal through conniving ways.  It's actually a very interesting story and even someone like me who normally daydreams through such moments was paying close attention and enjoying it.  Good writing.    Overall, great acting by all the characters like always, beautiful sceneries, magical superpowers dominate, good suspense and storyline development come together to create an entertaining chapter inthe Harry Potter films.
030788743X|1.0|I really can't recommend this book.  Here's the writing in a nutshell:  So I got out of my chair (the same sofa chair from the 'Memorex' commercial,) and walked into my garage, which looked like the garage from \\"Better Off Dead,\\" then walked past my Delorian and my Ghostbusters Car. I did a slide like Tom Cruise from \\"Risky Business\\" into my spaceship, which looked like the Millenium Falcon, but I named it \\"Serenity-X-Wing-Battlestar Galactica.\\" I hit \\"WARP DRIVE,\\" but then said, \\"too slow, let's go with LUDICROUS SPEED\\" like the speed from the 80's movie \\"Spaceballs.\\"  That goes on for the whole book. It's not even making any sort of judgements or commentary on 80's pop culture, which was special, unique, and totally worth discussing. This book doesn't do that at all. It's just acknowledging that the 80's existed.  Also, the references don't stay in the 80's. Frequently the protagonist-narrator mentions Kevin Smith, The Simpsons, Spaced, and Firefly. I know it's science-fiction, but some verisimilitude is needed here; There's no way an 18 year old knows the ins and outs of three decades of pop culture, especially considering he wasn't alive during any of them. Do you how long it would take to watch the entire run of just 'The Simpsons' alone?    There is ONE moment when Cline gets it right. The protagonist says, \\"I had THE GLOW.\\" Now, I know where that movie is from, and I get what that means, and it's really funny. You don't need to write \\"I had THE GLOW, like Bruce Leroy had in 'The Last Dragon.' There's a difference between SHOWING the reader that your heart belongs to the 80's, and just mindlessly TELLING us the things you witnessed in the 80's.  So many possibilities for an exciting narrative is just wasted by the empty love Cline has for the 80's. We're forced to read \\"action sequences\\" of Parzival playing 80's arcade games. Watching video games without the chance of participating is already a dull affair. Having to read about it should be a crime.  I could get into the cliche plot, or the characters that are simplistic to the point of being offensive, but only one flaw is needed to make this book lose all its potential to be clever and something to be remembered: Cline's act of stuffing everything he loves into the pages, without leaving any space for the blissful emotions he associates with them. I did not enjoy this book, but I am totally on board for Cline's second novel, whenever he chooses to write one. I'm sure these problems are temporary, and I'm excited to see how this new author grows.
B001FA0WI4|4.0|I found myself emerged in a world of lies, betrayal, and loyalty to an ideal against all reason. Sashenka was definitely a page turner and could not put it down. I feel that the writer did not allow readers to develop a true understanding of who Sashenka was and I would have like to understand her better. But, the detail and intrigue shown in this era of Russian Bolshevik thinking was truly riveting.
B004478GN8|5.0|I have two boys, 5 and 8, they can't get enough of these mini-kits with small ships and characters. They are perfect size and price.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Having no knowledge of the Thor storyline and very little knowledge on who he was this movie was extremely cool. I expected him to be invulnerable because he is son of \\"god\\" but he wasn't and this movie was really cool. It was visually appealing, and as with the other recent marvel movies, a great lead-in for \\"The Avengers\\". The 3D was pretty good quality and Natalie Portman is always nice to look at. You have a 3D blu-ray player this is one for the collection. If you like superhero movies this is one of the better ones.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|At first my wife started playing it on her phone. didn't think much of it. then i played it once ok? I couldn't stop. it was so fun! I got it on my pc and it's so much easier to see, she had a droid, it was slow and herky jerky.<br /><br />I have this and Angry birds rio on my computer now. I have all 26 eggs and 3 stars on all levels of angry birds, I lack maybe one star in rio. Rio is cool, the wood is easier to disintegrate and the birds get \\"hurt\\" faces when they hit the wood, or concrete blocks.<br /><br />repetitive game play. yep, all you do is shoot different birds in a sling shot and knock down some wood where Frog-like dudes sit. kill or knock the frogs down and win. some levels may seem impossible at first but with practice throughout the game it gets really easy.<br /><br />Walkthroughs are online and I had to use some of them to get 3 stars. I'd say about 40% of the levels I got 3 stars on the first time I played them. some I had tried 400+ times to get the three. you'll be alright though:)<br /><br />Careful, this game is extremely addictive and fun. I stayed up til 3 am several times in a row playing it on my wife's phone. she hated it, but now I don't play so much since the \\"mine\\" theme came out. it took about a week or two to get all 3 stars for those.<br /><br />some of the Egg levels will most likely leave you clueless as to what to do on them. like playing a tune on a radio or pulling an accordion and playing it. weird stuff. i recall there's one egg level that just has all the birds, frogs and wooden pieces seen throughout the game and you push each one in succession as to what sounds in the game.<br /><br />I don't know if i'd recommend this to anyone except me since I know I like it and it didn't completely consume me lol it's good now though. we cool.
031261246X|5.0|Zero Day is a very good, intelligent, and scary cyberthriller. This book should be read not only by IT gurus, but by the millions of other computer users who are ignorant of their computer's state of security. It is an eye opener into how fragile and unsecure our cyber-ecosystem is. The plot is very engaging and generally has great pacing. The story is filled with great twists and likeable characters. I'm glad that this book was written by someone with a techincal background, as all the proper tech jargon makes it just that more believable (and scary). Overall highly recommended. I cannot wait for the sequel. Thank You Mark.
B000YI7MRM|4.0|While checking to make sure the region code was appropriate for U.S. viewing I noticed in the list of movie information it said dubbed. I wrongly assumed that meant I could select english opption in D.V.D language set up. As I was watching/reading along it sounded like Viggo,It looked as if Viggo was speaking spanish but it was really hard to read words and lips at the same time. Maybe dubbed ment Viggo's lines were dubbed? I don't know but do not excpect to here the english language spoken in this movie. I've never read the books so I had no expectations, and enjoyed the movie alot. Great period peace,Great swashbuckleing fun, makes me wish I was multilingual. Great fight choriography. If there's one thing that drives me insane are these idiots mixing eastern martial arts in  european soldiery, less spinning back kicks and more half swording and cross gaurd strikes are what we need, western sword fighting has kicks and sweeps and grappling, and throws & more than enough elaborate moves to impress the audience.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|A GREAT show to make you smile....good that the entire series is available on one set that has an affordable purchase price. Well worthwhile if the Bundy family can take anyone away from the daily lousy national news we are subject too. I never get tired of watching these shows over and over....Al Bundy thinking never ages over time.
B005HEQIGO|2.0|Love the show, but whoever did the audio transfer on this one needs a new career.  Barely got past through the first 5 minutes.  It's like they threw it in a busted VHS player.

0312370849|5.0|This novel was recommended to me by three different friends. As I began reading, I realized why. Poignant, powerful, painful--the story is riveting and the writing beautiful. It reminded me of Sophie's Choice. Would love to see teachers using it in their high school classrooms.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The only thing I disliked about the book was that it could have been pared down without losing the story thread. If Both this book and the last had been edited with an eye towards moving the plot forward we could have had one book instead of two. That being said, This was still a better read than most other fantasy books out there and I will wait eagerly for the next installment.
B005U9RXWE|5.0|I gave a bad review to the previews episode. I got tired of seeing Walt being kicked around like trash. He might not be a/the hero, but he's the reason why I began watching the show. I mean, when you started watching The Godfather, were you rooting for the police? I think not. This episode redeemed the whole season's bad moments IMO.   ==== SPOILER ====  I said I wouldn't watch the next season, I think I will... and my smile will fade once I see Gus's face again... who probably survived and have this weird scary looking aspect. I really hope this doesn't happen at all.  Writers: Please let the predictable and unoriginal character of Gus be gone for good. I don't think the actor is bad, I just think the character isn't believable at all, it even looks laughable. And where is Mike?! He really is funny/believable/intimidating and somehow loyal.  Thank you,
B004EPZ08E|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies of the year that lives up to the trailer -- charlie day completely deserves an oscar nomination for his hilarious performance in this movie -- it is a revelation.  If only the academy would be more open minded to comedic performances and recognize Charlie day -- Kevin Kline and alan arkin won for comedic performanes.  Such a hilarious movie.  Not to be be missed.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted. As a huge fan of Pink Floyd and a audiophile, I am in love with this set. I love all the different mixes and audio resolutions! For those looking for something new, maybe you want to wait. But for those of us that love not just what the music is, but how it sounds, this is for you. The Blu Ray mixes blow me away!
B0019N94X6|5.0|Incredible my fav movie looks crisp and looks great sounds great this movie is a classic go get it ....
B004N5IZZ0|4.0|Good buy.  Not only is this audio version of the book but a production of the book.  What you lose in the reading of the text verbatium you gain with acting and less air time of this classic.
B000SINT52|4.0|The movie was pretty good. There are plenty of critiques of the factuality of the movie's statements, so I won't bother with those. Instead, I'll talk about my opinions of the style and content.<br /><br />It begins very well. It's easy to follow as long as you pay attention, and keeps a good fast pace. It slows down dramatically when the story visits Moore's hometown and goes on to cover the soldiers fighting in Iraq.<br /><br />It's almost like the coverage of his hometown and Iraq is a different movie, inserted into the middle of the real show. It's different in pace, style, and purpose. As I mentioned above, it's a slow pace. It also tries to illicit sorrow and emotional pain with the audience, with scenes and stories about loss of loved ones and ruined lives. Perhaps he should have made a separate movie about the personal loss, as a tribute and healing aid to those families and individuals who have had so much taken away from them by this war. The slower, more deliberate pace would have been well served with this separate movie.<br /><br />But, that aside, the rest of the movie was very entertaining. It definitely makes George W. Bush look like a complete and total idiot with multiple clips of media coverage. I do believe that Bush is an idiot, and am ashamed of him being our president just for that alone. There are those who claim those clips are taken out of context, without any of Bush's intelligent moments taken into account as well. I defend my view against that by pointing out that the simple fact that Bush has said and done those things, out of context or not, shows he's a selfish idiot. No caring, intelligent person would have spoken or done most of the things Bush is shown in the movie, whether they were at a formal dinner or hanging out with friends. A competent president wouldn't make those mistakes, or at least would be competent enough to minimize the damage. Bush isn't competent.<br /><br />The final comment I have on the movie is about the opening scene where he tries to make many of the Bush administration's officials look foolish as they prepare to be on camera. Paul Wolfowitz using his own saliva to comb his hair is an example. I've been working in TV broadcasting for almost a year now, and I've seen stranger. I also say \\"So what? Do whatever works to get ready.\\" If spit is what it takes to make last-minute hair and makeup adjustments, so be it.<br /><br />But, other than those problems, a good movie.he Bush administration's officials look foolish as they prepare to be on camera.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Probably one of the top three phone games, not your typical tower defense game, very well thought out, works great on galaxy tab 10.1
B0049P1VHS|3.0|OK, so First off this DVD (blueray) only has about 6 or so episods, second you have to like zombie movies, no exceptions. It seems that they lost funding or whatever right when the series was starting to take off. The first episod is introducing the main caracter and the work he finds himself in, and it was quite good. The second episode brings the full cast of main characters fully into play and pits the survivors precarious situation and alliances agains an unstopable hord of undead, this was also good, this continues into the thrid episode and frankly the series was pretty much on a roll here. after this we start to see what the meat of the show looks like which is in essance how to survive a zombie appocalyps permanently. amongst the last three episode the begin to get into that, some of this is frustrating but in the same way as its frustrating to watch the 'hot chick' haplessly walk outside into danger that audience obviuosly saw comming, and some of it is in that some of their (the survivors) ideas are simply bad or insufficient. Really though, this is to be expected if you are a fan of the genre. My only real complaint was that i paid full price (the same price as other series) for half a series and amazon didn't tell me it was half a series. as part of this same grip it also sucked that they didn't follow up to the last episode, it was quite a cliff-hanger.
0671027573|4.0|I enjoyed this book because the hero was not infallible and the heroine not too tough. The premise of the List of perfect attributes was a good line and the ending unpredictable because... no, I'm not doing a spoiler! Though I guessed the identity of the killer, I didn't foreshadow the twist at the end.<br /><br />A good read!
B002VL2PTU|1.0|Most of the scenes have a Michael impersonator and the singing does not sound like him at all to me. Like the recording his doctor made of Michael that they played in court, Michael could not make sense talking and he sure could not sing close to the end. By not making this video they could have left previous videos of Michael shine so that the terrible video This Is It! would not shatter anybody's great memory of Michael.
B005U9RXWE|5.0|What a great ending!  As promised, Walt ended up in charge...for the moment, not a spoiler.  The series found its sense of humor through all the trauma, and since we know there will be a fifth season, we can wonder where the next one will begin?<br /><br />Although the final scenes for certain characters were predictable, the actual ending wasn't, and we start with a blank canvass...<br /><br />I'm not fond of the word, but Kudos, Vince Gilligan and company!  Encore!!!
B005HPA2XI|3.0|I was pretty jacked when I preordered this album as I really enjoyed the musical shift on Crack The Skye, and I'd read that The Hunter would be a heavier, stripped down album - like a simpler Leviathan.  Sounded good to me.  Getting excited, I went to the official Mastodon website before the album came out, and sure enough they had their new single, \\"Curl of the Burl\\", available to listen to.  I pressed the PLAY button, only to come away a few minutes later feeling like I liked it, but then realizing I was just forcing myself to like it - it's pretty unmemorable, and now I skip it entirely when listening to the album.  Oh well, I figured THAT song is just the radio friendly single they have to put forward to get some album sales from the masses, the rest of the album will be original and awesome!  CD arrives on release date, and a handful of spins later I can safely say this is Mastodon Lite.  It isn't bad, it isn't great, it's alright.  None of the songs are all that memorable.  There are moments that rock pretty hard or have some real soul to them, but for the most part it sounds like they mailed it in.  The production is crisp and clear, which to me is a drawback for Mastodon.  I preferred the rawness of Leviathan for a good Mastodon sound.  The production sounds a little too processed, and the vocals layered too much that it makes them seem too distant (which I realize is part of the studio magic for making Mastodon's vocalists actually sing in key).  My final word to those considering buying the album is that I think the album missed the target.  You'll more than likely find a few winning songs on here, but about half are mediocre at best, and none of them are amazing.  I won't give up on Mastodon after this, it's a decent effort, but I expected more from them.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The prequels are horrible and nothing will change that.  The originals are great movies but unfortunately they are not included in this cartoony mockery.  Stop changing these films and give us the ones we grew up with.  Until then I will not be purchasing.

0316044695|3.0|Let's get one thing straight, right off the bat.  Navy SEALS are the single, most awesome fighting force in the world today.  The skills they possess and the attitude they bring to the table make me scared to give this anything other than a five star review.  They have my undying respect and gratitude for the things they do every single day to protect and nourish my freedom and that of every citizen of the United States.  I am a staunch Republican and a believer in a strong, pro-active defense.<br /><br />Now, to the book.  This is a non-fiction work, detailing the events which led to death of the author's SEAL team mates during a mission in Afghanistan.  It contains much interesting material on the nature of SEAL team operations and many individual missions and SEAL team members.  In that respect it is beneficially educational and at times enthralling.<br /><br />I would be remiss, however, if I did not address the heavy political baggage that the author brings to the table.  He is a rabid conservative Republican who frequently expresses his admiration for George Bush while repeatedly making venomous attacks on \\"liberals\\", most especially the \\"liberal media\\" and \\"clueless liberal Democrats\\", for whom he blames most of the deaths suffered by his compatriots.  Perhaps, were I in his shoes, I would feel the same way.  Lacking his perspective, I am left somewhat irritated by his non-stop, increasingly strident political pronouncements as the book progresses.<br /><br />While the book is in the words of Marcus Luttrell, the sole surviving member of his SEAL team, he was assisted by a co-author, whose role in the book is unclear to me.  The writing itself is not very high quality, as you might expect from a non-fiction work penned by a SEAL team member (or any non-writer).  If the co-author was hired to take Luttrell's recollections and craft them into a finished product, in my opinion he failed miserably.  The book is not terribly well organized or crafted.  The story is certainly one well worth telling, but should have been told more effectively.<br /><br />The author is proud of his membership in the SEALs and deservedly so.  However, the author ceaselessly informs the reader of his skills, superior training and all around greatness and that of his teammates.  He does this over and over again, to the point that it begins to grate.  Again, I concede the point.  I don't think anyone would argue, so why the necessity of repeating it over and over and over again.  This is an area where his supposed co-author could have been of assistance.  By their nature, elite combat troops must carry this attitude so it is hard to fault him for his arrogance.  His co-author or editor should have been of assistance here.<br /><br />Roughly half of the book involves a running fire fight between Luttrell's SEAL team and a far larger Taliban force in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.  I cannot, for the life of me, understand why there are no maps or diagrams to illustrate the very descriptive account of the battle.  The topography and headings of the team's journey are set out in prose in great detail, but a simple diagram would have been invaluable in tracking the SEAL team and then Luttrell himself as he flees his Taliban pursuers.<br /><br />Again, kudos to the Navy SEALs, Army Rangers, Green Berets and all other members of the United States Armed Forces.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|The last day in July is probably significant to many because it happens to be Harry Potter's birthday. To allow you all to completely ignore our collective nerdiness, we'll mention that this was also the day we saw The Tree of Life. Every now and then, there comes a film that completely knocks your socks off--The Tree of Life was that film for us. You could say that we expected to like it (or even felt that we had better  like it after having to deal with the excessive hype for so long. Luckily, we were not disappointed. Suffice it to say that we had what major cinephiles and those who happen to cheat death call an experience. The audience we sat with at our tiny little cinema was just as in awe of it as we were. We sat there silently, our eyes glued to the screen. By film's end, some were crying--yes, us included. Some walked out without saying anything at all, the dazed expression in their eyes communicating all they needed. Others nodded their heads gleefully. We were pumping our fists in the air in excitement. We ended up sitting on a bench outside, taking in the cool night air of the midnight hour and talking on and on about our experience before heading to a late dinner to talk about it some more. Sure, you can call us nerdy if you want. But The Tree of Life  was that beautiful, that profound, that effective. We had both just seen what is possibly the most life affirming film either of us had seen in our entire lives.  Sometimes life can be overbearingly hurtful and completely unfair in too many unforgivable ways. Many people try and find their own ways to remedy the pain and the sadness, whether it be from community contribution, art, work, religion, or simple birdhouse building. Sadly, it is not always this easy for some people to overcome their pain and their troubles. For many people, it is simply too overwhelming to comprehend the various harsh aspects of everyday life, and therefore the mere act of living begins to feel completely unsatisfactory. Findingthe joy and the tranquility of being alive just doesn't seem to quite justify the troubles in the world. This is very obviously what Jack (Sean Penn) feels every single say when he wakes up and goes to his job as an architect. His brother died at the age of nineteen and he tells his father over the phone that he thinks about him everyday, a sign that this event caused him deep personal turmoil. It isn't until Jack sees a tree being planted that he begins to retreat back into his memories and then challenges himself. His memories are what take up the bulk of the picture as he goes back in time to the building blocks of his existence and the existence of the rest of the universe before reminiscing on his childhood, growing up with his two little brothers and his very affectionate and angelic mother and his strict and frustrating father in 1950s Texas. It is through this that he must discover the complexities of life's emotions and what they mean to him as a human being. What we see in his flashback is his personal attempt to try and make a rediscovery and reevaluation on his existence.  Before getting into this film, it'd be best to warn people that this is a very unorthodox picture, even by Terrence Malick standards. I'd say approximately half of the people who see it will dislike it, and many of the people who will like it will mostly still be somewhat puzzled. The reason for this is due to the editing. This film doesn't unfold in the same way that most films do. It is disjointed, nonsensical, ludicrous, and very fragmented. In other words, this is the kind of film all casual filmgoers, and most movie buffs even, should avoid unless they are will to watch the film with an open mind for theme. Many will say that films should not require audience preparation or learned experiences of any kind in order to be good. The thing is, many of those people who say that are right. For example, with a documentary like the Errol Morris picture The Fog of War, it is necessary tohave knowledge and understanding of what happened during the Vietnam war, and therefore it will only be good for those people who do. The Tree of Life, however, doesn't really require any sort of knowledge to be viewed properly. You don't need to have read the bible or studied any type of scientific theory. It fact, the younger you are the better the film experience may be for you. This is because it's images and ideas will still seem very new and real. Since a lot of this film depicts childhood, I think children are going to be the audience the film will most resonate film.  Throughout the film, you'll see the entire universe get created, you'll see people reacting to death and to birth. You'll see people walking, running, smiling, crying, getting angry and abusive, and getting emotional and weakening in their stature. You'll see a set of parents marvel at the beauty that is their children and you'll see children marvel at the beauty of the world around them. You'll see the mother come up with creative and hilarious ideas to wake up her children, hug them, kiss them, run around playing with them, and even appearing in their dreams. You'll see the father hug them and kiss them as well, but not until he berates and hits them, scolds them, and lose his temper in his attempts to get them used to an often unforgiving and punishing world. This is a film that shows human existence at it's most natural. The world around these people is as much a character and the actual breathing characters. The animals, flowers, bugs, and nature are all flowing, fighting, and breathing just like these three boys and these two parents. This is all in accordance with the film's evident feelings toward Sean Penn's character and his difficulties with his existence. The film is trying to say that the world will not stop moving just for you to get over your miseries. Life keeps moving, and Jack has forgotten this. He has let himself drift into an otherworldly thought process in which nothing isgood and that progress is simply digression disguised as something bigger and more important. You can see it in his cold eyes as he wanders around the modern world as casually and as carelessly as a dust cloud. In his scenes, when the camera follows him it is almost as if he is on a conveyor belt. This effect gives these scenes a real eerie sense of dread and distance that almost become overbearing.  Before going on, special mention must be made to the fact that this marks the first film in which Terrence Malick depicts the modern world. All of his films take place at different times in history, which indicates that Malick is a huge fan of history and period dramas. Mention of this is important because Malick's view of the modern world is very interesting. It's all so industrial and mechanical, but it's not entirely a negative view. In fact, I think it's a very positive one. The environment look and seem bigger and more important than life and the people within it, and yet there is a strange kind of nature to it as well that makes it seem more like a post-modern view. I get the impression that this depiction of the world of today is primarily intended to be less an omen and more a recording of what people remember about modern civilization in the early 21st Century. Because of this, the rest of the film feels even more hopeful as a result. Terrence Malick comes across as a man with a wide range of interests, much like Werner Herzog, and prefers to tell stories that contain more information, detail, style, and importance than what most people experience in their life. His films feel less like they're scripted and more like they're constructed from every thought and theme that comes to mind and seems relevant to the central tone and idea. It is with this that Malick then chooses to explore and outline what everything means before allowing these ideas to grow and develop within the storyline. It's a very odd technique and to be honest few can say that it is without problems. All of Terrence Malick's other films are challenging in their own little ways, with Badlands being the most simple and The New World being the most obtuse other than The Tree of Life. The fact that this film takes place in the modern world, however, makes it a landmark in Malick's ever growing body of work.  So then Sean Penn gets to see the tree being planted, and from there onward the film becomes a collection of whispered questions about the universe and about the creation of the universe and the creation of creation, which then dissolves into what is the most controversial, most complicated, most off-putting, and most challenging part of the entire work. The creation of everything. This is the part that will ultimately make or break the film for you. The creation of the universe is one of the weirdest, most terrifying, more bizarre, and most abstract sequences we have ever seen in a motion picture, and to call it beautiful would be an understatement. It's such a ridiculously overblown yet magically creative scene, that one cannot help but appreciate it simply because someone had the guts to go all the way with it. It features state of the art photographic effects work from Douglas Trumbull, the same man who did the abstract work for 2001. The sequence is completely bizarre, almost Kenneth Anger-esque, in it's loud, bright, violent, and endless way. Everything just explodes and builds an rebuilds. Bugs crawl out of bubbles, bubbles crawl out of stones, stones crawl out of fire, fire crawls out of the air, and all the while set to the most intense opera music you can imagine. The effect is roller coaster-like in it's horror. Yes, eventually you also see dinosaurs. Without talking too much about the dinosaurs (since everybody else seems to go bonkers over the fact that they are in this film), the intended effect and idea was solid enough for it to work. Who cares if something is CGI or not, as long as the idea works well enough to support the effect. Most people who have seen this film don't feel it does, but we do. Lets move on.  So then we enter the best part of the film, as well as the longest. We finally see Jack's childhood, and boy is it incredible to watch. As troublesome and as confusing as it is, it is in many ways the ideal childhood. Two very strong, very human, parental figures in a beautifully average neighborhood with wide roads and limitless adventure. The backyards stretch infinitely and nature seems to exist everywhere. The three young brothers, all very excellently cast (the three look very similarly alike), all seem perfectly healthy, loud, frantic, rambunctious, and sun burnt in addition to being overly violent to one another and unable to handle death very well. Jack, in particular ends up growing very confused by his developing feelings and emotions and ends up killing animals and vandalizing things. In other words, they are normal kids in a world where normality doesn't exist. Their father, Mr. O'Brien (played by Brad Pitt, in his best performance), is a loving man who is always showing affectionate and warm love to his children, but remains constantly strict and tough to them in order to prepare them for a harsh existence. He wants them to remain children and wants them to stay innocent without taking away their freedom, but he obviously feels that he would be doing them an even bigger service by allowing conflict, violence, and anger into their lives in order for the good things to be so much better. Since the film is from the child's point of view, much of the father behavior may come across as cruel and too strict and harsh. To be fair, however, most fathers do occasionally tend to go a little bit too far with their children. Terrence Malick, at times, seems afraid to explore relationships with the father and their children, but here he does it fearlessly without any hesitations or cliches. It's an honest and truthful exploration of the relationship between a father and his boys. Occasionally he fears he is being too overbearing, and even apologizes to Jack for it, to which Jack responds by defending his father's actions against him. In order to really understand the power of that scene, you simply have to see it.  Their mother, Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) is the perfect opposite to the rough and tough father. She is so beautiful, so childlike, and so full of energy, imagination, and fun that she almost comes across like one of their own kids. The scenes involving her are the best scenes in the film, and what a breath of fresh air it is to see such a wonderful, uncomplicated, and joyful character in modern art. Often times, characters are either sharply one way or sharply the other. Her character is simple and beautiful without coming across as false or characterized. She has very abundant and strong emotional reactions to the world around her, which leads us to believe that in the past she has had it intensely rough throughout the course of the film she is re-experiencing a childhood that she never had through her own children. This makes her a somewhat flawed character in concept, but in execution she is perhaps the greatest woman you could ever meet in your life. Besides, perfection is overrated. That Chastain could communicate all of this is absolutely astounding. Her performance is stellar, gorgeous. Her beauty is exquisite. These two things combine to create the best performance by an actress we have seen in quite some time. Chastain is powerful, moving, utterly earth shattering. She is the emotional core of The Tree of Life and the one aspect that continues to stick in our minds above all the others. Thank you Miss Chastain for moving us to tears. Thank you Miss Chastain for allowing us to fall so utterly in love with you as the film's very own guardian angel. And thank you Miss Chastain, for gracing us with your presence. Watching you work was so raw, so personal that it felt like we were right there in the room with you, watching relate astory to good friends. That you can transport us as well as embrace us makes you dynamite in our book.  As the film nears it's end, the structure of the film becomes less disjointed and more elegant in it's approach to life and humanity. The twenty minute finale is something that we will not spoil except that it is one of the best finales to any film made in the last sixty years and it truly drives home what the film is about. Life cannot progress without weaknesses, desires, fears, mistakes, and most importantly, death. All of these things are good things in many ways because they strengthen what people triumph and feel proud about in life. The discovery of a lost pet. The new found respect shown by someone who you didn't think noticed your integrity (to do the right thing, not caring if people know). The resurgence of a new idea after a large scale plan falls through. The mistakes that allow you to meet new people and grow new friendships and relationships. The loss of a good friend who you realize causes you more pain than you realized. The arrival at a new place that gives you the chance to start all over with no mistakes. The accidental pregnancy that leads you to give birth to the new love of your life. In the end, there are no such things as primarily good or primarily bad things. Good and bad things come and grow out of everything, and it is up to you to take the bad with the good. The violent death of a sibling that you love and care deeply about is a painful thing to deal with, but it will also give you the chance to start your life again with the memories of people who you've been with as far back as you can remember. Death is not defeat, and just because a person dies does not mean that they don't exist. They exist in memories, in thoughts, and in who you and who the people around you are. You can see it as spiritual or as ethical, but until you learn to except death, life will pass by without you. This is what the ending of the picture meant to us.  Nofilm is perfect, and so while we can say that we love every aspect of the film in all of it's ridiculously overblown, ambitious, and bizarre glory, we cannot or stress how unorthodox the picture is. There will be at least one aspect of the film people don't like. There are those who may not like the Sean Penn sequences, but they'll like the creation sequences. There are those who may love the childhood scenes but may strongly dislike the ending. Then there are those who may end up loving the ending, but won't get to it because they'll walk out during the creation scenes. Or someone may love the Sean Penn material and the creation scenes, but then the second half of the film comes up with the childhood and the existential ending and they'll totally tune out. Then there are those who will love the whole film, but will get annoyed by the flame of light that keep coming up and appearing throughout the film. There are Atheists who will hate the film for it's religious overtones and vise-versa. There are those who will love all the material but will be completely uninterested in the Sean Penn scenes. It will be very hard for most people to love every aspect of the film, and it'll be an even bigger challenge for many of those people to even begin to at the very least appreciate the material they hate. However, that is what good art does. It challenges, it provokes argument, thoughts, and feelings, and above all it entertains.  Of all the ambitious motion pictures made since the creation of the movie camera, this is one of the most ambitious of them all. In the past three decades, there have been countless films made by big time directors whose goal is to make a large scale motion picture based on something either highly personal, highly ambitious, or highly experimental that is said to be inspired by Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Some examples include John Boorman's Zardoz, Gus Van Sant's Gerry, Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood, Nicholas Roeg's The ManWho Fell to Earth, Christopher Nolan's Inception, Gaspar Noe's Enter the Void, and most particularly Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain. Most of these pictures are either flawed or failed experiments that show plenty of potential, originality, and brilliance. Only one of them came extremely close to achieving what 2001 achieves (the Nicholas Roeg picture). Now we have this film, The Tree of Life, which manages to equal 2001 in it's power, it's emotion, it's ideas, it's intensity, and it's beauty. Terrence Malick's masterpiece is one of the greatest accomplishments in filmmaking history, progressing the storytelling movement to a whole new level that few films have come close to quite topping. The performances are shattering and revolutionary, the photography is already legendary, and the musical score in particular is just as perfect as the film itself. This will be a film that will be remembered for a long time afterward, and we can truly hope that more filmmakers can make films like this, because filmmaking is still in it's infancy and it can change the world as long as it continues to grow and develop. This is easily the best picture of the decade. This is as good as films get.
B000BTJDGM|1.0|My review for this product is bad. What I searched for was the DVD of this movie, it did not show me it was for the PSP. So this is a rip off.
0756686970|5.0|Great book with some nice little touches of humor. It has smaller pages but is a lot thicker than the previous DK Star Wars book which I prefer. It's also good to have a medal Han to go with my medal Luke. Amazing value for money too.
0307387178|5.0|I loved the way this book was written.  I'm a huge fan of journalism, and enjoy books like this.  I had read some reviews that said this was just an extended magazine article, but I didn't find it to be that way at all.  I couldn't find anything that should have been culled.<br /><br />I found the story on Chris McCandless to be extremely fascinating, and I came to admire him.  Here's a kid that has it all, intelligence, good looks, right college, connections, and he gives it all up to the point where he leaves his possessions in the desert.  Not many people have that type of conviction.  Do I wholeheartedly agree with his choices?  No, but I admire his conviction to follow his dream to the very end.  Unfortunately, it cost him his life.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Awesome DVD.  Some of the \\"Island\\" album a little slow and not of Pink Floyd character, but otherwise very enjoyable.
B004A8ZX2I|1.0|I never leave reviews, but I feel compelled to because this movie was so dissapointing.  I'm not very hard to please when it comes to movies, but this was an all around dry movie.  The acting was very uncinvincing, the script was cheezy, and was the plot was incredibly bland.  Don't waste 2 hours and $4 dollars like I did.  Try Hanna for an awesome espionage thriller if you haven't already.  Cheers...
B004YM6JLO|3.0|Despite the fact that I have given this series a three star I do love it. However, I fear that the plot through the last two seasons has moved so quickly that it is running out of it's fresh play between the supernatural creatures. The first have of this season is the typical nail biting lusty action. Unfortunately the end is rushed and a little silly. Too many characters are killed off. And is it just me or is there some crazy spell to avoid every mishap they stumble into? The only good thing about the end of this season is that it may mark the beginning of a relationship between Damon and Elena.
030746363X|1.0|I really felt compelled to write a review because, among the 1 star reviews I feel like not many people actually tried the diet. I tried this for a month. Really, against my better judgement but, I like other people here saw him on Dr. Oz and thought I would give it a try.Yes, his personality (which comes out over the course of the book) is quite repellant and he does border on douche material, but I chose to ignore that and proceed anyway. First of all the book is horribly disorganized and not very user friendly. There aren't any summaries at the end of chapters. You really have to take notes and organize a plan yourself. Fine, I did that but, it is easy to leave something out and after the first week I realized I wasn't doing it completely right.<br /><br />Anyway I got on track and I have to say that while the diet will make you lose weight, during the week. The binge made me gain it all back. During my binge day I did all the excersises and drank coffee, yerba mate and kombucha. grapefruit juice (phewww!) as perscribed. But, every week I would gain back the 4 lbs. I lost during the week (in one day!). Trust me the binge day is no treat because, it is so time consuming. I didn't  have time do anything, because of all the things you have drink, the exercises, the supplements and the eating every 3-4 hours.  I don't know why I kept with it as long as I did. I kept thinking that maybe it would change and that all those 5 star reviewers had success. Worse yet the diet makes you INCREDIBLY constipated! And I have never had a problem in that department. At one point during the diet I went an entire week without going. This diet was a horrible waste of time. And worst of all I keep thinking about all those cold showers/ice baths I had to suffer through. It really pisses me off! I really hope people read the one star reviews and realize that those 5 star reviews have got to be completely phony!
1401322425|5.0|I have made 90% of the recipes in this book and have never had a bad or even mediocre meal from it.  It is absolutely wonderful.  Aside from the great recipes, Jamie writes his books in a way that makes you feel like a friend (who happens to be a celebrity chef) is guiding you through a favorite recipe. If you love to cook and sometimes need a little inspiration, you should get this book.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Fast paced and trivia filled enough to keep any gamer interested.<br />I'm not a gamer, but as a child of the 80's, I was able to connect to the story through my memories of music, pizza joints, and Michael J. Fox.<br />The Dystopian Sci-Fi thriller is a fun read!  I recommend it to everyone.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Worked as hoped with my Panasonic LCD to my older Panasonic stereo.  Just hooked up the cables and done.  Didn't need to go to settings on tv.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I was not sure if this new series, Heroes of Olympus, was going to measure up to Rick's first series with Percy Jackson. But I was wonderfully pleased. The way that he included Roman aspects and Greek aspects was great. He let us in on an entire new world of demigods and Gods themselves.<br />This fast-paced, humorous sequel is a book that leaves readers begging for more.<br />Now we only have to wait another entire year before the third book in this series is released. It's going to be excruciating.
B004SB60OC|5.0|I had never heard of Christina Perri until I saw her on Letterman. I loved the song (Arms) that she did, so I ordered the CD.  There are only a couple of songs that I don't like as much as the others.  She has a very pleasant, unique voice.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|We will watch this again! amazing story line, great action, and wonderful acting.  Hoping there will be a sequel and more of her to watch!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|There are already way too many reviews of this so I'll be short. I am of an age where the Star Wars films were pretty impressive. I remember taking my son (he was about 9 or 10 then and is now 40 something) and standing in line (with geeks in costumes) for 4 hours to get in! Now these same geeks (or their offspring although I have a hard time imagining them reproducing) are posting 1 star reviews because George Lucas had the effrontery to change a single line in the originals. These are, in my imagination, guys who still live at home and have a life size cut out of Princess Leia (where do you get those anyway? I'd love to have one) next to their bed.  Look, Lucas made some adjustments I wouldn't have, but it's his film and he can do whatever he wants.   What I wanted was a clean transfer to Blu Ray and interesting special features and that is what I got. Go ahead and buy this and unless you are one of those geeks you'll really enjoy it.
B0059R5Q08|3.0|Beautifully shot, and Michael Fassbender was fantastic. I didn't like Mia W's portrayal though - I always imagined Jane as tighter, more still, her powerful emotions held back forcefully. Poise covering a firey passion. Mia's Jane just seemed young and unsure.   Also, what I consider one of the most powerful elements of the story seemed completely missing - erotic tension. There seemed no sexual attraction between Jane and Rochester - in the book, that was the contrast between Rochester and St. John - one attracts her physically, humanly, while the other appeals to her spiritual, goodly side. In the end she chooses passion.   I felt that was all missing from this movie.
1594202710|5.0|A good primer on China history and especially recent events, form probably the best informed western person there's.  It exposes both American and Chinese positions from their own points of view and without silly preconceptions usually associated with Americans.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Prequel to Spartacus: Blood and Sand, this is a six part miniseries set in ancient Rome in the days of the gladiators. Unlike many reviewers, I have never seen Spartacus, so I am going to take this review as a first time viewer of this show.<br /><br />Quintus Batiatus is ambitious. He wants power. In his father's absence, he gets a taste of that and is anxious to ascend the social and political ladder through his various dealings. His promising gladiator, Gannicus, shows great promise and virtual invulnerability in the arena (he bests one opponent blind folded for crying out loud). As Quintus maneuvers, there are other forms of maneuvering going on with his own slaves as infighting between the Gauls and the rest of the group comes to a head and the treatment of slaves as sex objects gets a bit out of control.<br /><br />As someone who has never seen the rest of the story, I can tell you that this miniseries is entertaining as a standalone story. It also makes me want to see the Blood and Sand. The action is intense and the story is gripping. As you may have guessed by the review title, there is a lot (and I do mean a lot) of graphic violence and sex scenes. The language is also such that it would probably beat out a locker room. If you are sensitive to any of those things, be careful with this one. If you thrive on those, this is great.<br /><br />The DVD quality is excellent. The special features are pretty much in line with other sets although admittedly, they have bloopers and I always enjoy those (and not all DVD sets have them).
0385302320|4.0|I did love this book, but it packs in about three times the action of Diana's previous books in this series. I almost wish she'd made two books out of it, and fleshed out each escapade a bit more. I loved how she savored each detail in her first two books - the pace was somewhat slower and I kind of missed that in this book. But, that said, it's a terrific read and fun to see what's happened with the characters in the 20 years they've been apart.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I have had this app only a few days, and have experimented just a little.  I can tell already it's going to be fun.  The effects are great, and so easy to apply.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|I'm not writing a detailed review. Saw some 1 star reviews here which I totally can't agree.  I vote between 4 and 5. I've been listening Opeth since their early days and I like their late works, maybe this one the best. I don't care too much about death metal nowadays(getting old), actually I'm glad they moved away from death vocal, the contrast between clean and death vocal becomes boring after a while. I believe the current style is what they feel like to do at their current stages(the trend become very obvious in their last a few albums). They are talented musicians and the result sounds good to me. Death vocal or not, it's good, fresh music with a lot of interesting details to listen to.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I heard one song on TV during an interview and was impressed so I bought the CD.  I was surprised to hear his voice in song -- it is perfect for this style of music.  I am really enjoying this CD.  Hope he records more music.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it keep the kids occupied, besides who does not like to shoot birds at building to kill pigs?  I know I do.
0143116371|2.0|In my view this book isn't really about 'street' fashion photography.  It's more a personal photo album of Scott Schumann's fashion industry friends in their designer clothing. That's why so many of them appear more than once in the book.  Bit of a con really.  I also think that so many images of people smoking is likely to influence young people into thinking the deadly habit is 'cool'.  It's not and it's never a good look.  Infact it's a shame that these folks spend so much money on their clothes only to have them reeking of smoke!    Give me Wayne Tippetts any day!  If he ever releases a book of his far superior fashion images, I'll be first in line!
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|This is an okay movie, def. not as good as the the first one. I didn't find myself laughing as much and was really let down. I would rent this film before you decide to fork out the money and buy it. I hope they don't decide to make a third.
0393072231|4.0|Many people on Wall Street still do not understand what lead to the financial crisis that caused our current recession.  The Big Short unravels this mystery in clear language.  It was so complex that even top executives at major investment banking houses even tried to learn how it all worked.  They only knew it was a way to make a quick buck so it must be ok.  How wrong they were.
0316017930|4.0|My title \\"Insightful\\" is the best way I can describe this book. It opened my eyes to the fact that a single event or series of events in your life good, bad or ugly can be the event that leads you to success, wealth and happiness.<br />I liked this book because it helped me understand a lot about myself and why I became successful despite great odds. Maybe great odds against me was my event. My book \\"Through my Eyes\\" explaines all that and more.<br />After you read this book, try mine... LOL.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Robert Jordan was my favorite epic fantasy author until I read Sanderson's work. In the WOT series, Brandon wrote so similar to Jordan that I was a quick fan. However, it wasn't until I read The Way of Kings that I really fell in love with his writing.<br /><br />The storyline and plot are amazing. From beginning to end, he holds the reader's interest. The reader feels as if they know and can connect with the characters, as if they are part of the story themselves. The pacing was wonderful. Many times an epic fantasy will feel too drawn out or slow. Whenever the reader thinks the story might be at that point, Sanderson throws in a great action sequence, or a scene with so much tension you can't put the book down.<br /><br />There are multitudes of characters we meet and each has unique perspectives and life lessons to pass on. Not once did I feel there were too many. Each had their place.<br /><br />The most amazing aspect of Sanderson's story is the world building. From grass that hides underground during storms, people with marbled black and crimson skin, to people with eyebrows over a foot long!<br /><br />The Way of Kings is action and tension packed. I often found myself sweating while reading. Any book that can leave your heart pounding is a great book in my opinion.<br /><br />There is no doubt; I give The Way of Kings five out of five stars. I honestly cannot think of one aspect of the book that I disliked. Except a couple of the characters. But what is a great book without a few characters to hate?
B000VECAEO|5.0|I own all the Seinfeld DVD's - Every Season - My only regret is there's not more.<br />If you liked the show (and I loved it), you may have missed an episode here and there so now you can see them all and go back to the good old days of real funny TV. A show about nothing - Only a Genius like Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David could pull this off on network TV without a single cuss word. Classic material and a simply incredible cast make this a must see again and again and again.<br />And if you've never seen this show you owe it to yourself to see it now.<br />10 STARS
0553381695|4.0|Book two in the series, A Clash of Kings, easily doubled or tripled the fantastic element of the first. The climax fit the epic genre more than the first and the characters were more intriguing.<br /><br />Catelyn Stark takes on a bigger role in book two when she needs to show strength for her children, especially Robb. The Stark children are spread out away from each other, each having bits of their story told. Tyrion takes on a larger role in the second book, both in the storyline, and for chapters dedicated to his character. Many of the plot elements come to a head during the climax for A Clash of Kings and Martin finishes it all off with an epic battle just outside the city gates.<br /><br />I wanted to give A Clash of Kings 5 stars, but I don't think it's quite there yet. The story is great, the writing concise and intriguing, but I need just a little more. Since the series feels more like a single massive story broke up into single books, I can't judge it completely yet on the first two chapters.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I own all the Seinfeld DVD's - Every Season - My only regret is there's not more.<br />If you liked the show (and I loved it), you may have missed an episode here and there so now you can see them all and go back to the good old days of real funny TV. A show about nothing - Only a Genius like Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David could pull this off on network TV without a single cuss word. Classic material and a simply incredible cast make this a must see again and again and again.<br />And if you've never seen this show you owe it to yourself to see it now.<br />10 STARS
0811876373|5.0|I love this book!!! The pictures are very detailed as are the descriptions in the book. They did not miss anything. I need Step-by-Step instructions when it comes to cooking/baking and this book provided that. My first attempt at baking cakepops was a huge success, thanks to the details in this book. I feel the author went above and beyond by providing suggestions for what types of cake batters would go best with certain types of icing and then goes on to describe how to make frostings. If a author wanted to skip any details in their book, I would think this information would have been left out - but I am so glad this author kept it in. It gives great suggestions and hints all throughout the book. The creative ideas (which all have pictures) also help when at the store picking out colors of melts. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to bake cakepops and do not know the first thing about how to do that. I can't see how we couldn't all become masters at baking cakepops with the guidance of this book. 5 Stars!

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Just had it a couple hours &amp; it took just a little bit of getting used to, but already one of the best $1.49 I've spent lately. The free version was functional but was limited such as not allowing you to delete files after copying to the pc etc. I get a lot of MMS pics of the grandkids &amp; an efficient way to get them on the pc &amp; then to free up room for more is invaluable
B001OQCV2O|5.0|Excellent special effects
B004XNGKBS|4.0|The product does what the description says it does and does it very well. However, as a note- taking app it is lacking. for one, there is no easily available way to increase the size of the drawing insert. Is not easy to make actual drawings in the notes because of this. Some handwriting recognition would be nice, like when i start a bulleted note it could automatically indent for me. Also, it doesn't have a native recording function that ties into the notes. I've been waiting for an app to do this on Android.  So basically the app works very well as far as note apps go, just not that much better than pen and paper

B00005JKZV|5.0|I love this movie, and thought I could watch it again and again. Owning a DVD to have the freedom of carrying this movie where ever I go is something i thought would be worth the money I spent. Unfortunately, that was not true for me. I have the movie since like a month now but have only watched it once. It was only the hype of owning this DVD and once i had it, i didnt care. That said, I would still rate it at 5 as it's one of the the best movie i have ever seen. You will know when you like it.
