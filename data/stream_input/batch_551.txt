B000BW7QWW|5.0|Sci-Fi, Western, drama, comedy, action-adventure, space opera, whatever you want to call it, this film is all heart.  The characters are quickly outlined and filled in, brought to life in their interactions with each other and the breakneck pace of the plot.  If it feels a bit rushed compared to most films, that is only because this movie has so much more to say.  This movie is not about space, politics, or good and evil, it is about people.  An unusually large cast of \\"main characters\\" is quickly and adeptly introduced to you, each of which is endearing in their own peculiar way.  A doctor with endless devotion to his sister, a mechanic with an unstoppable sunny disposition, a quirky and somewhat goofy pilot, a caring and wise religious man, a mildly dimwitted yet powerful mercenary, the doctor's tortured and talented young sister, an unfailingly loyal first mate, a stunning and adoring companion, and the rugged realist who captains them all in their attempts to carve out a life for themselves on the edge of civilization. <br /> <br />The companion is actually a prostitute, and yet somehow she is the only character with any real social status and respectability in society.  And it doesn't bother you or seem quaint.  In the amazing world that has been created here, it just seems normal. <br /> <br />That being said, so interested in every aspect of the \\"verse\\" due to brilliant and witty dialogue sprinkled over a deep and involving plot, I could have easily sat for another two hours if they had chosen to dig deeper into this world.  I swear I thought the whole thing lasted only 40 minutes.  The world Mr. Whedon has created is teeming with depth and completeness that draws you in quickly, and seems tangible from the first scene. <br /> <br />As the plot unfolds and the action sets in, the interactions between the characters are engaging and brief, but much like old friends you haven't seen in awhile, you immediately understand where they are coming from and the intricacies and depths of their relationships to each other.  These relationships serve not only to illustrate the story and decisions they face, but they actually drive it forward and add great depth to the conflicts unfolding on screen.  As varied a crew as they are, they seem at home with each other and so real you'd think you might run into them at the shopping mall or grocery store. <br /> <br />There is a heartfelt sincerity and love that is exuding from the experience of this film, and I consider myself lucky to have caught it at the end of its run in the theatres.  On a Sunday afternoon, with a rather old crowd and about a half-full theatre, the audience actually stood up and applauded this film when it finished.  A sixty year old woman walked out with tears in her eyes, and I myself actually had trouble driving all the way home, so many thoughts about family and friends were racing through my head. <br /> <br />This film is all heart.  If you have a heart, you should buy it.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Mariah Carey is the musical equivalent of a muppet. She can't carry a tune with a handle on it. Her songs are all produced by hot \\"current\\" trendy producers with rappers added in. She screams, howles, and does everything else but sing. The Grammy's made a horrible decision to nominate this fat, no talent cow.
B000BJS4F8|5.0|A perfect balance of song selection - glad to see some of her personal favorites and some of her biggest hits. <br /> <br />Her most underrated track has to be \\"Still\\" featuread on the soundtrack to the movie Dogma. <br /> <br />I wish we got a videography on the bonus disc and I'm anxious for new music. She's got a great voice, skill as a songwriter - she writes her truth and she hasn't sold out by trying to duplicate her staggering success.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Mariah Carey, the stuffed sausage dog whistle, has sites that give links to reviews of other female singers telling her fans to write bad reviews. This is so immature. In any case, here's a true, valid review of this album: It's musically amazing, but the rating has to be slightly downgraded because of its lyrics in some songs. \\"I Love New York\\" is hard to listen to because it's Madonna trying so hard to be something she's not. However, she completely makes up for it with musical masterpieces, such as \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Jump\\" which are riveting and live in your head long after the songs stop playing. \\"Isaac\\" is not the controversial track it was made out to be. It's actually very fun and spiritual.  <br /> <br />In any case, don't listen to the bad reviews on here. They are planned from the stuffed sausage fans.
B000AA305M|2.0|What you should know right off the bat is that David Gray's newest album doesn't use the same recording environment as... well, pretty much the rest of his catalog. Instead of holing up in a basement or attic with a Midi sequencer and a weathered guitar, Gray has gone hi-fi, with the occasional (mostly) subtle string accompaniment. I'm convinced that Gray is strongest when *just* using a guitar or keyboard, but he doesn't seem to want that attention. But at least this new producer apparently got Gray to stay away from the Midi sequencer, the root of the drum and bass flourishes that distracts from some of his finest work, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />The first track, \\"Alibi,\\" is practically a template for the rest of the album, for better or worse. It ambles along with some spare mid-tempo minor keys before it finally crashes into a chorus that sounds fantastic with headphones but is otherwise not worth the wait. You'll find the theme of \\"not enough seasoning in the soup\\" throughout this album, in my opinion. Some brilliant things occasionally shine through, but Gray is otherwise far too sedate and relaxed.<br /><br />\\"The One I Love\\" goes Bryan Adams (not *Ryan* Adams) on us, with twangy roots rock, but it too doesn't do anything of distinction until about halfway through, before quickly running back to safe territory.<br /><br />The unusual time signature of \\"Lately\\" isn't too jarring when the percussion and drums finally come in, and at least the man is at last streching some creative wings. The lyrics, unfortunately, tread water, with the chorus in 4:4 time to reinforce the generally conventioal direction of the album. It also overstays its welcome by a good minute.<br /><br />\\"Nos Da Cariad\\" is where things warm up. In fact, up until this point I'd never heard the man rock harder. Syncopated, off-beat percussion definitely helps this track, as do the sinuously-delivered lyrics. Some backup female vocalists (!) come in about halfway through, but Gray doesn't give us much more than a tease. Then he pulls back with a breakdown and gradually adds all the layers back into a climactic end. Catchy overall, but it doesn't stand up to extensive repeats.<br /><br />\\"Slow Motion\\" does, however. The heavy drums harken back cringingly to his electro-stained earlier work (I say \\"stained\\" because I thought the combination was horrible), but once again, halfway through, he throws a delightful curveball with a upbeat chanting chorus, followed by a gentle breakdown and another buildup to that really chatchy chorus. It's an infectiously happy song.<br /><br />\\"From Here...\\" sounds like a sketch, not a completely filled out song. It's so sparse and unmodulated that it never really takes off, although it suggests it might at any moment. I dislike that kind of musical tension if there's no payoff. His falsetto is quite awesome here, but underused.<br /><br />\\"Ain't No Love\\" is a gem, although I would like to know what it is, since it's not love. He mentions it several times but never finishes the thought. Gray starts out with what sounds like a clavier before sliding gently into a soulful piano ballad. His raspy voice is used to particularly good effect here. The middle section gets uncomfortably late-period Foreigner before settling for returning to the opening verses, thus (in my opinion) lessening their impact.<br /><br />\\"Hospital Food,\\" besides being a whiplash change of pace from the track right before it, has some odd Southern rock harmonizing on the  vocals (odd for Gray, anyway) but otherwise sounds, honestly, like an alt country toss-off. He seems barely interested, and the song doesn't end so much as deflate ungracefully.<br /><br />\\"Now and Always\\" was such a formulaic yet bloated effort that I could barely sit through my only complete listen. It barely registers on the album's radar. He has a Beatles-esque crescdendo at the end, but it's yet another case of taking too long to deliver too little.<br /><br />\\"Disappearing World\\"(misspelled on the album) is also quite staid, save for a eye-widening rock-out (almost precisely in the middle of the song) that sounds like a snippet from a much more energetic album -- performed, arranged and produced by other people. Yet, once again, he retreats to a quiet and undistinguished resolution.<br /><br />...So it's a little bitter that David Gray took so long to realize he could record in an infinitely superior production environment, because he only shows glimmers of that same downtrodden, rained-on passion and soulfulness that allowed his earlier work to overcome its low fidelity and narrow instrumental scope. After all, he *has* been pushing out material on a regular basis for over ten years now, with nine or so main releases.  That's a helluva lot of tracks to press.<br /><br />But he also apparently isn't downtrodden anymore. While his success gets him production values that bring him closer to Billy Joel-like piano rock (which sounds like his calling at this point), it also seems to have assuaged him of the pains that he strummed about before. In his previous work, I thought that Gray was often engrossingly analyzing the human condition, but I guess  he was only lamenting *his* condition, which the eventual royalty checks and public affection cured him of.<br /><br />So what now for us miserable bastards, now that one of our mascots hit the jackpot and found his personal Jesus in the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow? I have a strong feeling that his songs are going to start showing up in car commercials and forgettable, big-budget relationship chick flicks like \\"Serendipity\\" and \\"Autumn in New York.\\" Gah.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but this album is a pretty good explanation of why David Gray isn't a household name. He really could have grabbed the bull by the horns, but seems like he doesn't have the passion for the chase. There's also much less of the insightful and poignant lyrics that make songs like \\"Hello and Goodbye\\" and \\"Lead Me Upstairs\\" nearly indelible. He ends up using refrains a lot instead.<br /><br />You'll probably disagree with me, until you've given your favorite songs some extensive listening and discovered that there usually isn't much to recommend to them aside from a brief splash of energy and superior production. The more I listen to this album, the more I enjoy his more lyrically rewarding work. \\"Slow Motion,\\" in my opinion, is the only true keeper. Too much of the remainder is David Gray doing an unconvincing job of heartbroken minstrel.<br /><br />On the other hand, he has an album of re-recorded material on iTunes that strips out a lot of the bassy drumminess of his earlier stuff and allows me to enjoy his best material as I personally think it was meant to be heard: with a piano or a guitar. Artistically, it's a little saddening to hear how much more soulfulness he pours out on the iTunes stuff -- his earlier work. It just reinforces the rote aftertaste of almost everything on Life in Slow Motion.\\"Disappearing World\\" (misspelled on the album) is also quite staid, save for a eye-widening rock-out (almost precisely in the middle of the song) that sounds like a snippet from a much more energetic album -- performed, arranged and produced by other people.

B000089RV6|5.0|AC/DC not only proves on this cd that they are going to be remembered forever as one of history's most important bands but also that even with Bon gone the legend that is AC/DC will live forever. Hells Bells, Shoot to Thrill, Back in Black, come to think of it the entire album is a spectacle (except the only song i don't care for on here, Shake a Leg). Some people may have you think that Brian's voice sounds screechy. if you've ever heard You Shook Me All Night Long (which i guarantee you have) then you know how astounding it is. this is one of the best selling albums ever and 30 million people can't be wrong. if you can't bow down to AC/DC's greatness then you should go listen to your Green Day or Fall Out Boy cuz you deserve to listen to that trash. if you don't own it, buy it. if you have it....GO LISTEN TO IT AGAIN.

0140177396|5.0|\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is an absolutely stirring, poignant, and tragic portrait of human nature, a book of harsh reality. As a book of only 107 pages, many find it hard to believe that such a short book can have such impact on the reader, in dealing with such a complex subject. This is great testament to the author, John Steinbeck, and his short, sweet, and to-the-point writing style, letting the characters provide the complexity (there is a LOT of dialogue) through their interaction. Ranch laborers Lennie and George both seek a real, yet delusional dream, that they want to believe is tangible, but the reality is very different, as others have dreamt it before them, while they at the same time have done absolutely nothing towards the dream's realization. It is all just an illusion, by those who seek to transcend their current situation in life, just keeping the dream with them, for whenever they need it, for their personal reassurance that one day, things will change.  It is worth reading for the last 8 pages alone, for its stirring, disturbing, and tragically humanistic climax. Definitely one of the best fictions I've ever read. Highly recommended, unless you're one of those who got the book banned from several school libraries in 1993 and 1994 for \\"promoting euthanasia\\".................................
068987474X|5.0|Okay, Greg. I heard what you said. The end. It's over. I'll quit obsessing. It's just that I wanted something more tangible. It's hard to admit that he left because he just wasn't that into me. Because, if that's the reason, then it takes away my ability to fix it.
B000065BPB|5.0|I bought these the other day. They have wonderful sound while blocking out at least 90% of the sounds you hear daily. Great headphones. I would greatly recommend.
B000002QWD|5.0|Since the song \\"White Christmas\\" is the most popular Christmas song and that song is so closely associated with Bing Crosby, well, you simply need this disk to play and fill your home with music for the Season.  Those of you who do not remember or even know of Bing Crosby can search the Web and find out what a huge star he was in the thirties and forties.  He continued through the fifties and sixties, but more limited to his generation, like those older rock acts you see on PBS nowadays.<br /><br />Anyway, he does the songs in his own way, but very straight by today's standards.  The mood he captures is how Christmas felt around my house when I was a child.  Heck, he even sings a verse of Adeste Fidelis (O Come, All Ye Faithful) in Latin (albeit a twangy American Latin - just the kind that would have been heard in a Catholic church at the time).  There are a couple of upbeat novelty Christmas songs such as \\"Christmas in Killarney\\" and \\"Mele Kalikimaka\\" (Merry Christmas in Hawaiian - very popular and exotic at the time).  He does three of the numbers with the Andrews sisters (including a delightful swing \\"Jingle Bells\\") and \\"Silver Bells\\" with Carole Richards.<br /><br />Fine Christmas album.  It just can't be a complete Christmas without Der Bingle singing \\"White Christmas\\", would it?
0694003611|5.0|My 2 boys loved this book, as do I. The colors are so vivid and the pictures are adorable. The \\"flow\\" of the words are calming and never failed to lull my little boys to sleep. They are much older now and of course don't ask for this one anymore, but I kept it. Just couldn't get rid of it. We still read to my youngest son every night- chapters of \\"Whimpy Kid\\", etc, and haven't opened this one for years. However, the other night when I was tucking my almost 10 year old into bed he said \\"Mom, remember Good Night Moon?\\" I really miss reading it to them. Hopefully one day I will be able to share it with grandchildren. This book is a classic.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is a must have CD and even better than his debut album!  Turn down your lights, get comfy and prepare to be swept away into the world of Michael Buble.  The love he has singing these standards is evident on each and every cut.  They're sung with richness and passion, a true delight to listen to...you can even tell the musicians are enjoying themselves with these songs.
B000089RV6|5.0|I own over a 1000 cds but there are only a handful of albums where I think every track is great. This is one of those albums! Even 25 years after the release of Back In Black I still listen to it at least once a month. Songs like Hells Bells and Have A Drink On Me still get my blood pumping. After the unfortunate death of charismatic lead singer Bon Scott, AC/DC came back stronger than ever. Enter ex-Geordie vocalist Brian Johnson and the band would create a classic album that would go on to sell more than 21 million copies in the US alone! Apparently Bon had all the lyrics written for this follow-up to the excellent Highway To Hell, but when Brian joined he decided to re-write them. I don't think Brian's sense of humor is quite as clever as Bon's but there are plenty of classic lyrics all over Back In Black and Brian has quite a set of pipes. It would have been interesting to hear Bon sing these songs but maybe it was his death that pushed the band to another level. The production and songwriting on Back In Black are the highest level the band ever achieved. Angus' lead guitar is simply the best of his career. Check out the solos to Hells Bells, Shake A Leg, and the title track! And the riffs are some of the catchiest that the Young brother's ever came up with. I'm not going to bother going into each track because they all rock. Back In Black is an album that everyone should own!!
B000BW7QWW|1.0|You know it is bad when it is released on DVD like 9 weeks after it is released in theaters! Talk about huge turn-around.<br /><br />This film is based on the Firefly TV show which failed miserably on network television. So some genius decides to make it into a feature length film with a huge budget and guess what... the film also fails miserably! Did the dingleberries not learn their lesson the first go-around?<br /><br />The part that is really frightening is the rabid fanbase who acted like a pack of lunatic hyenas trying to get people to see this. It seemed like the word subtle was not in their vocabulary and the end result was it kept even more people away.
B000002J1O|5.0|Just kidding, I like Van Halen too. But seriously in 1973 Steve Hackett did some amazing guitar work only this album. One of the first recordings I heard a guitar player 'finger tapping' ala Van Halen. From the first time I heard this back in the '70s, I fell in love with Selling England by the Pound. It's beautifully dynamic - one of those albums you can listen over and over again; you can put in a CD player and select repeat and listen to it all day.
0812550706|5.0|This is perhaps the best SciFi book I have read this year. So good that I went out and purchased other Card books... but came to the conclusion that this book could have easily (and should have) stood on its own. Buy this book if you haven't read it, or can't find it in your library.
0385335482|1.0|This book is very similar (read: derivative) to Bridget Jones' Diary. The main character is an idiot. Though Kinsella explores how \\"shopaholics\\" rationalize their purchases, she ties the ending up in a nice little bow where the heroine still has her cute buying habit. This book is completely predictable and boring. I would have not read past page 15 if I didn't want to feel like money was wasted on this. If you are looking for trite chick-lit with an unrealistically happy ending, go on ahead.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The latest adaptation of \\"The Phantom Of The Opera\\" was quite different from what I expected.  My only experience with musicals outside of Disney material like \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" (both recommended) comes from \\"The Sound Of Music\\" and \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\" (also both recommended), and for some reason I expected this version of \\"Phantom\\" to be full of lavish sets and singing during the rehearsals and performances of the stage company's productions (which it was) but I didn't expect so much of the film outside of those parts to be conducted in song.  At first it discombulated me a bit, but as the movie went on I was increasingly glad it had taken this route.  It was an unusual way to go for what, while being a romantic movie lush with tragedy, is still also very much a horror movie.  But the songs and musical accompaniment all through - expertly done by an extremely talented cast and ensemble of musicians - perfectly conveyed what the movie was going for. <br /> <br />   Full of grandeur, dark awe, emotion and visual magnificence, the latest version of the tale of the ill-fortuned opera house and its resident specter combs territory not fully delved into in previous versions I've seen and features cinematography that develops the most dramatic moments to maximum effectiveness.  The amount of light-hearted humor was also unexpected, but it made for some great contrasts, including the first appearance of the thunderous-voiced Phantom during a packed-house performance of one of the company's musicals, bringing the house to a shocking standstill. <br /> <br />  One of the few problems was with the Phantom's main nemesis.  He was a fine, likable character, the performer who portrayed him a great actor and a great singer, but he did not strike me as being a realistically adequate foil for the grand and often ferocious Phantom.  A defeciency that's not crippling but has slightly hobbled a few excellent horror movies over the years.   <br /> <br />The otherversions of the \\"Phantom\\" movie I've seen are the Hammer version starring Herbert Lom and Heather Sears - not one of the best Hammer movies by a long shot, but still good, featuring an excellent turn by Michael Gough as the wickedly and humourously deplorable theater owner: it's available in the \\"Hammer Horror Series\\" set which also includes alltime greats like \\"Nightmare\\" and \\"Night Creatures\\"; and the 1989 Robert Englund/Jill Schoelen version - a much more vicious version feauring a far less sympathetic Phantom, it also has some great music that's sadly gone unnoticed. <br /> <br />All 3 versions recommended; I've yet to see the Lon Chaney silent version, the 40s Universal version, the 1998 \\"Il Fantasma Dell'Opera\\" Italian-language version, the 1916 German silent version (apparantly among a number of films from that era of which no print exists any longer, sadly), or the 1983 or 1990 made-for-tv versions. <br /> <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is the Best Album ever, and I don't think I am exaggerating. I listen bands like Pearl Jam, The Beatles, R.E.M, Nirvana, the Mars Volta, Pink Floyd, etc. Thiz are all great bands, sure, but not another album in the world is composed the way this one is:    1) Yorke's composing style and ability is incredible, John Lennon could be considered as good as him. Just listen \\"Paranoid Android\\" and you'll se how good it is against \\"Imagine\\".    2) Music, sound, and composition is perfect. When you listen songs like \\"Yellow\\" or \\"The Scientist\\" you know something is missing. But when you hear \\"Karma Police\\" or \\"The Tourist\\" you simply cry of the perfection.     3)100% non-comecial music. Radiohead play what they want, not what people whant to hear, so their music is done in a free way, with no agression or pression. Dejavu on \\"Exit Music\\" anyone?    There are lots of other points to be said, but thats enough. And Coldplay lovers, please, PLEASE!!! Don't compare Radiohead with that music, the quality bar is to far away. Just go and lock yourself in your room, because here, there's no room for Coldplay. (Yes I hear Coldplay, but I dont like it as I do on Radiohead nor the other bands listed before). Call me fanboy, I seriously don't care.
0767802470|4.0|The Atlantic Ocean, 1941.  German U-boats are struggling to maintain mastery over the sea, challenged everywhere they turn by the British Navy.  Increasing numbers of German vessels are being lost and manpower is running short.  The Nazi government has resorted to sending callow young seamen out on missions that are steadily growing more dangerous.  Welcome to the world of Das Boot. <br /> <br />Beautiful camera work and poignant dialogue draw you into the world of the captain and crew. You share with them the boredom of non-combat operations, the thrill of the chase, and the terror of a depth charge laden destroyer passing overhead.   <br /> <br />Das Boot goes to great lengths to make you forget that the crew are Nazis, instead focusing on the human aspects of the seamen. Change the language as well as a few story elements, and these men could be fighting for any country.  One sees the struggle of the men to understand what it really is that they are fighting for, their anger at being forced into such a dangerous position by a government whose ideologies many of them do not share. <br /> <br />Regardless of whether the crew are Nazis or not, when you hear the telltale ping of a passing destroyer's sonar, and see the abject horror splayed across the faces of these young men, you forget that they are fighting for one of the most despicable governments ever to exist, and instead empathize, feeling every bit of their terror and suspense right along with them. <br /> <br />From beginning to end, Das Boot is an involving film, a must see for every fan of war films. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Because the truth is that Jared Leto and company have quietly made one of 2005's standout rock albums. As someone who has been hooked on 30 Seconds To Mars since their debut self titled release back in 2002, I can safely safe that \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" is a huge leap forward from the last record (which was great to begin with). 30STM have really come into their own on this release, and as the last record was a broad, atmospheric, spacy and electronic effort in the vein of Tool and Led Zeppelin, \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" is a straightforward rock record with electronic elements. Fans of the afformentioned bands, or of Hard Rock and Alternative will find that this is probably one of the best true rock records to be released this year.    To begin 30STM has a much more focused sound on this record. The songs have been trimmed down to 3 or 4 minute pieces, and in the places where the band would wander or drift off aimlessly in the last album, they stand firm and determined on \\"A Beautiful Lie\\". Jared's voice is just absolutely amazing on this release. It totally overshadows his effort on the self titled. The lead single \\"Attack\\" is a shining example of this. His voice simply carries the song and takes it to new heights when he expands his vocal range. \\"The Kill\\" and \\"The Fantasy\\" are also notable example of Jared's vocal improvements. The guitars continue to work very well together, while not being focused on nu-metal sounding riffs as on the last record. Instead they work together to produce a vintage rock sound that feels perfect for the band. The electronic elements have continued to be incorporated into the band's sound, although they are not as abundant or overwhelming as on the debut. 30STM made a good decision when they decided put their rock elements first and then have their electronics as a background element. This does make the songs carry much more weight instead of pushing the electronics first and have the music come second. Songs like \\"Attack\\" and \\"The Fantasy\\" are obvious rockers, while \\"R-Evolve\\" and \\"A Modern Myth\\" give the album some diversity. The two bonus tracks \\"Battle Of One\\" and \\"Hunter\\" are great additions to the album, although I believe they are available on every album (so that doesn't quite make them bonus tracks). These two tracks should have come before \\"A Modern Myth\\" though; it would have made the album flow better at the end. Overall the album is an excellent listen, especially if you were into the band before this release.     30 Seconds To Mars may not be one of the most publicized bands in the music world today, but they are definitely one of the most talented. \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" is a welcomed addition to the group's discography. Some thought that after their self titled debut, we'd never get anymore music from these guys, but they have returned in true fashion 3 years later. Fans of Hard Rock, Metal, Alternative or just rock in general will find this album offers plenty in every department, and has enough diversity to keep you interested throughout the entire record. My hats goes off to Jared and the guys of 30STM, they have done an excellent job with this release.
0679731725|4.0|I am writing to refute another user's comment that the book was \\"very faithful to the movie.\\"  The book preceded the movie, and therefore was not in a position to be \\"faithful to the movie.\\"  Second, the book and the movie are quite different.  The most major difference is that the movie conflates Mr. Farraday and Mr. Lewis into one character.  The movie has Stevens serving Mr. Lewis, who is supposed to be the same man who attended the conference years earlier.  There are numerous other smaller differences (such as the names of the Jewish girls and that in the movie they are refugees), but to say that the movie is a faithful representation of the book is simply inaccurate.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|This is definitely my album of the year. <br /> <br />1. It's Like That <br />It's Like That is a great club song.  The remixes are amazing, and so is the original.  A very fun song. <br /> <br />2. We Belong Together <br />I'm sure we've all heard this whether you have the album or not being that it hit #1 on the Hot 100 Airplay for 16 weeks.  This track is amazing lyrically as well as the production. It definitely deserved every bit of success it recieved.  <br /> <br />3. Shake It Off <br />Probably one of my favorite songs.  The lyrics are fun as is the beat.  It's a very fun song, and I'm very glad it was released as a single. <br /> <br />4. Mine Again  <br />This reminds me of a song that would of been a b-side to the Butterfly and Daydream albums.  It is very reminiscent of those albums.  The vocals are fantastic, and I think it's what we all longed for after hearing Glitter and Charmbracelet. <br /> <br />5. Say Somethin' <br />Say Somethin' was originally supposed to be the first single off THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI.  It's a very fun Neptunes produced track.  Pharrell even won a Grammy nomination for this I believe.  David Morales produced an AMAZING remix with re-recorded vocals by Mariah which actually leaked yesterday. I'm hoping this will be the next single.  This also features Snoop Dog. <br /> <br />6. Stay The Night <br />Stay The Night features an amazing vocal performance by Miss Carey. This would be my other choice for the next single.  The lyrics for this are pretty good too. <br /> <br />7. Get Your Number <br />Get Your Number is like a mix Shake It Off and It's Like That.  It's another fun club track. It was produced by Mariah and Jermaine Dupri and also features Jermaine Dupri. <br /> <br />8. One and Only <br />One and Only is a great track.  It has an addictive beat and the raps and melodies are top notch.  This was an instant favorite. <br /> <br />9. Circles  <br />Circles was the first album track from TEOM I heard. It gives off a great70s feel, and is a fantastic ballad.  The vocals are great too. <br /> <br />10. Your Girl <br />Your Girl is probably the song I listen to the least, but thats not because I don't like it.  It's a good song though. <br /> <br />11. I Wish You Knew <br />I Wish You Knew has an addicting hook.  I love it. <br /> <br />12. To The Floor <br />To The Floor features Nelly.  This was also produced by Pharrell, and is another one of those fun club tracks, which this album seems to have a lot of. <br /> <br />13. Joy Ride  <br />Joy Ride is a great song.  It's one of the slower songs on the album, and very melodic. Joy Ride was put on the album when another song titled When I Feel It couldn't be put on the album for certain issues regarding a sample it used. <br /> <br />14. Fly Like A Bird <br />Fly Like A Bird is the stand out song for me.  It really captures Mariah's emotion, aswell as her vocal and songwriting skills.  The lyrics carry a very strong meaning. <br /> <br />15. Don't Forget About Us <br />Don't Forget About Us, the current and fourth single is a great song. It's probably the most vocally strong track of TEOM. It's a grower, but I've grown to love it. It features some very nice lyrics. <br /> <br />16. Makin' It Last All Night  <br />This song is also a grower.  It was produced by Jermaine Dupri as well as It's Like That, We Belong Together, Shake It Off, Get Your Number,  and Don't Forget About Us. This is one of my favorite songs because of it's beat. <br /> <br />17. So Lonely (One and Only Pt. II) <br />So Lonely is an amazingly catchy song which is already getting decent amounts of airplay for being only an album track aswell as Mine Again.  It features Twista and will be his next single. <br /> <br />18. We Belong Together (Remix) <br />The remix features Jadakiss and P. Styles.  This remix recieved amazing amounts of airplay. It's almost another song within itself.  It's definitely one of my favorite Mariah remixes next to My All/Stay Ahwile, I StillBelieve/Pure Imagination, and Thank God I Found You/Make It Last. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is AMAZING. I don't think the crazy brainless Madonna fans will make you change your mind after reading these reviews, but don't let them.  This album is definitely the album of 2005 and doesn't feature a single filler song.
0380807343|3.0|Coraline was recommended to me by a fellow teacher.  I purchased it along with some other fine examples of YA lit. but I just couldn't get into it.  The concept was good and had the making of a masterpiece for my YA collection but the shallow character profiles and lack of a good, climactic ending left me wanting for more.  Like a decent meal that wasn't a hit, this book was just missing something crucial.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|Get a clue.  We need to stop this whoremusic genre.  I admit that I liked the \\"Beautiful\\" single but only because it wasn't forced.  I was in a Walgreens and someone triggered the singing Santa in order to drown out her craperversion of The Christmas Song. <br /> <br />I have heard better singing/moaning in porno movies.  The only thing worse would be if Nelson, NKOTB, Menudo, and the Great-Great Grandchildren of the Osmonds got together for a day long Christmas benefit in my basement while dwarfs forced broken glass shards into my hindquarters.
B00005JO1J|5.0|WARNING! There are gays, lesbians and cross dressers galore!   There are druggies and slackers and artists quite poor!   There are people with AIDS, if you can handle that fact.   And a bunch of folks completely unrepentant for the way that they act.   It's funny, it's sad, all set to music, it's truly obscene.   It's liberal, it's queer, it's Sodom and Gomorrah depicted on the big screen.   It's about living each day, knowing it could be your last;   and setting aside the future and the past;   it's about no day but today, and love straight and gay, and friendships through hardship and holding your principals fast, about not selling out though your hungry and cold, and knowing that you won't live to grow old. A lot of people this idealism will offend, to say otherwise, I won't even pretend. But if you are a sinner, an artist, a liberal like me, this movie is truly one you must see. Viva La Boheme!    One reviewer claimed that the movie had nothing to do with the bohemian movement as they critisized the characters for not wanting to pay rent, insluting the 'yuppie scum' and feeling that they should only focus on there art. Now, I'm a bit confused by this review, who clearly does not approve of such things and also who clearly does not know what bohemian *means.* I'm tired of people who disaprove of the characters actions saying that it doesn't have anyhing to do with bohemia- because it does. They are trying to shoot the movie down in ways that are not accurate or truthful because they do not approve, and that is not in good faith. You want to disapprove- fine. Your disaproval does not make it *not* bohemian. Here is a little info from a website about bohemian lifestyle.    Although the bohemian population was diverse, one particular aspect of how they lived served as a unifying factor: the rejection of bourgeois values. The values they typically rejected and how are as follows:    They rejected private property and materialism by having no permanent residence anywhere and by surviving on little material wealth.   They rejected strict moral values by living carefree lives of alcohol and drug use, as well as open sexual freedom.   They rejected the pursuit of wealth by living solely for art and literature's sake, pursuing their passions regardless of whether they gained an income, which they usually did not.   Members of Bohemia often adopted a communal lifestyle, sharing lodging with other Bohemian companions. They often carried around a few luxury or decorative items that served to spruce up a drab living space for a night of celebration.  The bohemian life was carefree. As part of their rebellion against \\"genteel\\" society, bohemians felt no reason to exhibit moral or socially acceptable behavior. One participant, Houssaye, printed in his memoirs, \\"We were afraid of nothing and thumbed our noses at public opinion. . .The most outstanding characteristic of our Bohemian existence was our open revolt against all prejudices, I might say against all laws. We lived as if entrenched in a fortress from which we made belligerent sallies ridiculing everything.\\"  Bohemians tended to indulge in alcohol as well as drug experimentation. In fact, drugs were used by many to supposedly help with inspiration. Bohemians were also overtly promiscuous, in contrast to how the bourgeois obscured this facet of their lives.   In contrast to the Bourgeois preoccupation with obtaining wealth and status, the bohemian life was characteristically idle; idle in the sense that they did nothing that yielded material wealth. A friend of Houssaye said, \\"I don't do any work, on the pretext of writing a poem; and I write a poem to have an excuse for not doing anything.\\"   Bohemians felt the need to express and assert themselves, being at such a social and economic disadvantage. It was almost as if they flaunted their marginality; by practicing an alternative and contrasting lifestyle, bohemians undermined the bourgeois.   [...]t/hist255-s01/boheme/lifestyle.html
B000BVEKO0|5.0|See you on the other side...translated, Past meets the Future.  KoRn's 7th attempt unlocks a new version of KoRn for it's fans.  Many diehard fans, such as myself, was concerned for the future of KoRn, but fear not, for this 7th attempt is a work of art!  Starting with the minute long intro for \\"twisted transistor\\", something you will not hear on the radio.  It builds you to a point, and then Munky drops it on you...\\"twisted transistor\\" ends and the CD rolls you into \\"politics\\" a fun sing-a-long song.  Then on to one of my personal favorites, \\"hypocrites\\".  The CD continues with track after track of new, but different music.  Track 09, \\"coming undone\\" for instance, is a type of song that I do not know if I should headbang or clap.  Who knows?  All I know is that I love it!  And the last track, \\"tearjerker\\", is just that, a signature Jonathan Davis ballad that will pull at your soul.  This CD is full of the past and the new of KoRn's sounds.  It is filled with amazing fill-in's as well as background sounds that completes each track.  Jonathan is back with his glorious vocals as well as genius lyrics.  David's drum performance is...as usual, prefect.  Fieldy is here with his signature low nasty bass lines.  Munky may have lost his brother Head, but he has a new brother, his K7, ripping up each track.  True fans of KoRn will purchase the deluxe version, which has a bonus CD filled with extra music and custom remixes and video's, and a one year membership to the KoRn club.  I purchased both the deluxe edition and the standard edition, which strangely has different CD imprints on the disc as well as different booklets with different pictures.  Why?  who knows...that is our KoRn.  See you on the other side...I am already there.
B000AARKOO|2.0|Orlando Bloom plays a recently widowed blacksmith in France who is sought out by his father, Liam Neeson, a noble and a knight returning to the Crusades in Jerusalem. Orlando follows him, then inherits his estate after his untimely death. Suddenly, everyone is listening to this nobody from nowhere, and Orlando ends up heroically leading the army of Jerusalem. Huh?<br /><br />I guess movies like this about interesting historical periods are very hard to make. Look at Alexander and Troy. I thought I was conversant with the Crusades, having read a score of books about the period (specifically the fascinating Eleanor of Aquitaine), but found this murky movie impossible to follow.<br /><br />P.S. - Note to Ridley Scott: every cut does not spew blood like a geyser.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|God bless my uncle Frank this was his favorite film and when I ask <br />him why it was he would tell me it's everything you could want in a <br />movie. The \\"ultimate thrill\\" ride he would say. He had the pleasure <br />of seeing King Kong when it premired in 1933 as a child and several <br />times after that until his mother would have to come and collect my <br />uncle from the theatre herself. This Collector's editon tin will be <br />the pride of any true fan of Kong young or old. The image transfer <br />is nothing less than perfect and although I'm not a sound major the <br />audio track sounds decend enough to hear all the talk,sound effects <br />and that rousing Max Steiner film score. The extras on the disc are <br />the same as the non tin disc with include the Cooper Documentary, <br />RKO 601 (which by bravo to Peter Jackson and the spx gang at Weta <br />for their spider pit outtake is nothing less a flawless labor of love.) The tin edition does include the extra mini poster set and <br />a replica of the original 1933 theatre book which shows that the <br />people at Warner bros do make an effort to give you your dime's  <br />worth. King Kong is just one of those films that works and gives <br />back to viewer what they expect to be..entertained. What my Uncle <br />said before will always hold true \\"It's the ultimate thrill ride\\"
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Anyone else notice how a lot of the negative reviews here fail to explain just why they didn't enjoy the film? There's a reason for that; because it's an excellent film that pleases both fans and nonfans alike.    Following on from the television series, \\"Firefly\\", \\"Serenity\\" is set 500 years in the future where a crew of people aboard the serenity ship try to make a living while avoiding the  clutches of the totalitarian government alliance.  Things are complicated when a girl with psychic ability boards the ship; who is valuable to the aliance.     This film is particularly well written, manages an ensemble cast well with witty one-liner dialogue and tells a unique storyline with a space-western feel to it, whilst enabling itself to explore political and powerful concerns important in today's society.    This is one of the rare good films to have been released this year and certainly worth keeping on your shelf at home next to the original star wars collection.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|As with each and every Enya release, this was worth the wait!  It's pretty evident in all of Enya's projects the amount of caring and \\"quality of talent\\" involved - and this newest album is no exception.  Simply spellbinding! <br /> <br />Wow indeed!!  Oh, how this woman sings to my Celtic heart!   <br /> <br />Do yourselves a favor and GET THIS!!!!!   <br />
0140187650|5.0|Eichmann in Jerusalem is one of those few books concerning the Holocaust that offers both the historical authenticity of primary texts and analytical perspective of secondary sources. The actual trial itself is, as Arendt has written, surprising in the banality of the defendent, and yet ever more chilling because of it. Arendt herself is an arcute observer and her reflections during the trial offer fresh insights into the mindset of the perpertuators even now. While many of the Holocaust books offer intimidate details on events, few dwelve into the minds of the 'villains' the way Arendt has. I highly recommend this invaluable book, not just for studies of Holocaust, but for anyone who is interested in how the human mind works, and how typical assessment of the these situations fail to account for psychology.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|... I like John Mayer's pop music better than others out there. Your body is a wonderland although simple is a great song I think. But this record proves Mayer is a real musician. Palladino and Jordan are too good for them to play on a record that wouldn't be worth it. Plus Mayer has worked with Herbie Hancock. what else does he need? Mayer deserves the respect of listeners and musicians alike.
B00005JNX0|5.0|Madagascar is great!  It is great for kids and adults.  My 2 year old watches it and just laughs.  He talks about the animals in the movie and really enjoys it.  It is good for adults as well.  We love Madagscar!
B000005HLV|3.0|first off, this is the best mayhem album ever composed-HAND'S DOWN.  the only down side is the vocals (to a point). i wonder if the group went and picked up attila from a port pub before he shipped off because they sound like they have a drunk pop-eye singing for this album, and i crack up.--no disrespect to attila because he did great work in tormentor-but it's true.  but then something funny happens, the singer grows on you and when compared to listening to the songs with dead on them and attila, the attila versions are far superior.  i know euronymous had many plans for this album and he would of succeeded much further had he lived longer, oh well it's a great album none the less.
0307276902|3.0|<br />Please be careful who you give this book too!   <br /> <br />After reading several reviews, including Oprah's, I decided that I would purchase this book for a friend of mine who is currently struggling with substance abuse, as an inspiration/motivation.  Upon receipt of the book, I decided to read it before sending it out as a gift - I AM GLAD I DID!  Initially, my thought process was that this book would serve as a inspiration and helpful \\"been there and succeeded\\" tale.  The story itself focuses on James' recovery and his experiences with the institutional facility.  He states, on several occasions, that he feels that people who believe in the \\"AA\\" mentality and the 12-step program are looking to find a reason to not take on accountability and responsibility, and the programs are useless!  As a friend of someone who is trying to us AA as a stepping stone to put thief life back together, I am very happy that I decided NOT to give them this book.  It would make anyone who is currently working towards recovery through AA and the 12-step feel inadequate, unsuccessful and possibility hopeless. <br /> <br />James Frey does a good job telling a story - but it should NOT be shared with someone that is currently battling substance abuse and firmly believes that the AA program works for them.  It is not inspirational!  <br />
B0002BO0US|5.0|The Zombies were almost ignored by the record buyers through most of their relatively short career from 1963-68. They only managed to release two albums and about a dozen singles, of which only three hit the charts. Almost everything they did record was of very high standards.<br /><br />This album, their second, from 1967 is usually considered their best recording moment; and it really is a great album. Both songwriters Rod Argent and Chris White contribute strong material.<br /><br />Except for \\"Butcher`s Tale\\" for which I never really cared, there are no fillers here.<br /><br />Then to the extensive inclusion of great bonus tracks.<br /><br />Chris White`s \\"I`ll Call You Mine\\" was the B-side of the \\"Time of the Season\\" single and as such a very logical choice. A great recording<br /><br />The White/Argent collaboration single \\"Imagine the Swan\\" was the follow up to their world-wide hit; unfortunately it failed undeservedly. It was recorded after Colin Blunstone had left the band; in fact they did record an album`s worth of material which recently has been released in Japan titled \\"Rest in Peace\\" which was the origal working title for their never released follow-up album. Most of these recordings are featured here as bonus tracks. Most of these recordings are up to the same standards as \\"Odessey and Oracle\\".<br /><br />Besides \\"I`ll Call You Mine\\" and \\"Imagine The Swan\\" songs like \\"Smokey Day\\" and \\"I Could Spend the Day\\" are all-time Zombies favourites of mine.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you are reading this review you are considering buying Serenity, which is wonderful, because this movie did not get NEARLY enough attention at the box office.  It was one of the best movies of 2005 in my opinion - hopefully \\"The Powers That Be\\" will green-light a sequel if the DVD sales are impressive. Enjoy!!
B00005JNBQ|4.0|First for the actual review: for what it is, Napoleon Dynamite is a good movie. It's funny and offbeat, it's somewhat different, it has likeable characters, and it's a fun story about a bunch of high school losers that holds your interest and gives you some laughs. <br /> <br />However... this movie is also overrated. I mean, you can't go anywhere without seeing a \\"Vote For Pedro\\" or \\"Gimme Your Tots\\" shirt, and almost everyone on facebook.com is in a Napoleon Dynamite group. I think people think a little TOO much of this movie. Like I said, it's a good movie, but wow... people, please... <br /> <br />Despite this, I still give it a recommendation. Just don't expect Raging Bull.
0060899190|5.0|Like the site, the book somehow manages to evoke the feeling of not being alone - it's stunning to see people's secrets that they have finally decided to entrust to the entire World.  <br /> <br />It has so obviously been a catharitc experience for people who have contributed. <br /> <br />Everyone I show it to recognises something of themselves in it. <br /> <br />I recomend it to the entire population - buy it, read it, contribute to the next one. <br /> <br />
0684824906|5.0|Of the year's history books, I'd rank Team of Rivals at the very top, above even David McCullough's fine 1776.  At once a group biography and a history of the Civil War and the years leading up to it, this book is a true achievement. <br /> <br />Using the lives -- sometimes separate, sometimes intertwined -- of Abraham Lincoln, William Seward, Salmon Chase, and Edward Bates, Goodwin takes the reader into the tumultuous world of American politics in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s as slavery increasingly came to dominate the national (and sectional-state-local, for that matter) debate.  Goodwin tells the stories of the rivals in the years before their careers intersected and does so in a way in which no detail, no anecdote, seems out of place.  Everything seems relevant, either to getting an idea of the personalities of these men or to following the history of the period.  Through these individual biographies, Goodwin allows the slavery debate to unfold.  This section is brilliantly constructed. <br /> <br />While the first part is more biographical, the rest of the book chronicles the unfolding of the Civil War, militarily and especially politically, and the role these rivals -- and a few others, including Edwin Stanton -- played in running the war.  The details of the war itself are fairly well known, and Goodwin doesn't break any new ground there.  However, she presents these events through the lens of the friendships and rivalries within the Cabinet.  It is a revealing -- as well as fascinating -- approach.  In the mind of the reader, as well as of men like Seward, Lincoln emerges as the best of the bunch, magnanimous in victory and gracious in defeat, a master of the day-to-day give-and-take of politics. <br /> <br />I'll repeat a minor complaint I've heard voiced before:  next to Lincoln, Seward, and Chase, Edward Bates seems not to warrant the extensive treatment he receives in the book.  Except for the fact that he was considered for the 1860 presidential nomination (and one can debate how seriously that consideration was in the first place), his accomplishments and reputation do not match the others'.  Far more deserving of the fourth slot -- and far more exemplary of the \\"rival\\" label -- is Edwin Stanton, despite the fact that he was not in the running for the nomination. <br /> <br />But this is a small point in a book so large, so interesting, so well-done.  Team of Rivals is sure to become a classic.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a love story that cuts across lines of gender and sexuality, gripping the viewer with a dreadful sorrow that the deep and passionate devotion that these two lovers feel for each other is forbidden to them, on sentence of death. I cannot imagine how anyone but the most hard-hearted and bigoted of viewers could fail to see that the lovers portrayed in Brokeback Mountain are not different from us--whether we be gay or straight, male or female, rural or urban, we are all capable of loving the same way. Their tragedy is simply that society was and is incapable of accepting them. But most of all, above and beyond its controversial topic, Brokeback Mountain is one of the finest examples of filmmaking I've ever seen. I will make a point of seeing it again before it leaves the theaters.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|If you are not a fan of KoRn, you need to check this CD out...It might change your mind.  \\"See You On The Other Side\\" still has the KoRn vibe to it, but it has a much cleaner, more thought out sound.  Songs on this album vary from heavy head bangers to creepy melo masterpieces.  It is well worth the extra money to pick up the Special edition.  The three extra unreleased songs fit in with the CD perfectly.  Do your self a favor and get an amazing album now, before they become the new cool thing....again. - The ScOOtt<br /><br />Best songs.....all of them!  When it comes to KoRn, its all the same to me.  The most diverse tracks from the rest of their cataloge would be #13, #14, and #5.
B000AP04FG|2.0|Granted these are pretty people, particularly AJ, but in the service of what, God only knows...despite lots of fun 'sposions and stunts, this movie goes nowhere fast. The last third, or so, really drags...lest I forget though, Vince Vaughn is a total hoot in it, providing much needed comic relief and entertainment value....
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I actually really enjoyed Exciter, I would have enjoyed it more if one of my friends had given it back!!!!  Anyway, this is a good album, take it from a big Depeche Mode fan whom enjoyed People are People and who's favourite album is Black Celebration and song is Enjoy the Silence.  What does that tell you, enough I hope.  It's true isn't it?   You like that song and that album, if you don't then why are you even listening to DM, why I ask you?  I had a really cool DM shirt from an amazing tour I saw them on, but somebody stole it.  See everyone loves this band.   So this album is good becasuse they are dark, like Songs of Faith and Devotion and Ultra, truly two albums that have hit you where it hurts, so what more do you need to know?  Just listen to it, I enjoyed it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|PLUMB CRAZY: What's happened to me? My entire life, I've never ever been this enamored of a film. It's like catchin' a serious case of the Beatlemania. There's way too long a wait for entertainment worthy of some serious fanaticism. Never fear: `Serenity' has arrived.  <br /> <br />HOT AS A WHOREHOUSE ON NICKEL NIGHT: Terrific dialogue rendered in a wickedly engaging lexical mixture of American West / Mandarin / semi-antiquated English. Hi-larious repartee. Strongly delineated characters that (gulp!) actually drive the plot rather than the innocuously interchangeable folk we see in today's tv/film. Unique future worlds where the only aliens are the people who inhabit them. A frontier-style existence butting heads with the 26th century. And that's just the beginning. `Serenity' is a rodeo ride of adrenal action, bucking emotional intensity, jolting plot-twists (ok, enough metaphor.) Oh! I can't forget the stirring score by David Newman. Haunting musical motives for the ship as well as for its captain, passengers and enigmatic foe.  Did I mention absolutely perfect casting? Can't imagine anyone else in these roles. (And yes, I've ordered multiple copies of Serenity - a most excellent Christmas gift for the deserving.) <br /> <br />POWERFUL GOOD: Once upon a time, my housemate forced me to view a single downloaded episode of this movie's tv series precursor: `Firefly.' Bang! I was hooked. This little bit of illegality paid off in spades for the network beancounters; I went on to purchase 4 dvd sets of the tv series. (One is going to my local library. Share the wealth!) <br /> <br />Having said how enthralled I became with the show, I'm way too close to these great characters and their world to ever step back and judge impartially. So I can't really attest to the `standalone-ness' of `Serenity' for newbies.  <br /> <br />However - some anecdotal evidence says it's a great introduction to this wonderful world of writer/director Joss Whedon: I took an uninitiated friend to the Boston `Serenity' opening. By her demand, I loaned the Firefly discs one by one. Within 5 days, she was phoning me, \\"Ok! I'm ready for the next disc!\\" \\"Uh... sorry, those 14 episodes- that's all there is.\\" \\"WHAT? YOU'RE KIDDING! WHAT AM I GONNA DO?\\" (See Serenity again, naturally!) Now, with her own Firefly dvd set permanently occupying the player, she's begun filming a documentary focusing on Firefly/Serenity's New England fans.  <br /> <br />FINE AS CREAM GRAVY: One last thing - for me, frustratingly irresolute Anti-heroes and downright congenial Villains never fail to create that delectably mysterious `grey' area so reflective of our actual lives. Thanks for the inspiration Joss!
0553801503|5.0|Wow, after reading some of the negative reviews of this book (let's call it book number 4A), I was a bit worried. But a needless worry, there is little discernable lettup of quality in this book from the first 3. To be sure, there are not quite the number of seismic events within the timeframe (I'm guessing about 8 months) written about in \\"A Feast for Crows\\", but rest assured, there are NOT very many new characters introduced (other than the obligitory references to scores of relationships and relatives!); and the plot is not meandering at all. A Feast for Crows largely tells tales of minor skirmishes and political intrigue that follow the extensive wars that comprised the second and third books. Perhaps the nay-sayers simply are not impressed when there isn't a steady diet of death and destruction or nonstop action?<br /><br />Martin keeps the focus over the story's timeframe to 6 major characters: Brienne, Jaime, Cersie, Sansa, Arya and Samwell; introduces a few characters to flesh out the political climate of the southern land of Dorne (curious about the Red Viper's home?) and describes the ongoing saga of the Ironborn as they seek to infiltrate their way into the mainland.<br /><br />It seems to me that this is a plenty big, but scarcely new, canvas of storylines to keep track of. I appreciated the limited scope of the book to these storylines; many times as I read the first three books, I would skip several story lines to follow the evolution of one or two of the characters before going back again. This is a perfectly logical approach to the story telling as there is very little physical interaction between the characters in this book versus those to come in the next. Martin's choice to segregate the 4th book into books 4A and 4B isn't the least bit distracting if you can put the other characters on hold in your mind (which you have to do in any book, just for not quite as long a period of time).<br /><br />Within the six major characters storylines, we get (amoungst other things):<br /> - An update on the doings of the Westro's most clever (and extremely honorable, in his own way) player, Littlefinger as Sansa's \\"father\\". As with most of Martin's characters, Petyr Baelish comes in various shades of grey; readers are afforded a chance to draw their own conclusions as to just how grey...<br /> - A momentary look at Catelyn revived (for better or worse!) in Brienne's story<br /> - A momentary look at Jon who sends Sam and Maester Aemon on a mission<br /> - The releationship of Cersei's son and daughter-in-law; and the administration for the Iron Throne done Cersei's way<br /><br />Several storylines are making a direct beeline for Dany, and it's too early to tell where Brienne will end, so I think it pre-mature to criticize the editing until more has played out. Thus far, I haven't seen any storyline drift into irrelevance so I have no reason to not be optimistic...<br /><br />As for those who liken this release to the crumbled messes that became Jordan's WOT (somewhat revived in KoD), or to a lesser degree Goodkind's SOT, give it a rest! Complain all you want about the lack of action, but the details and pace (reasonably fast for my tastes) of the story are well justified for those readers who are curious about characters and cultures of all of the major kingdoms and how they are reacting to the events of their time. There are no endless fussings over fashions, no endless repetitions of mannerisms, no 200 pages to cover the day in the life of one character (apparently there are those who actually like such ramblings in the WOT world?), no endlessly immature characterizations, no repetative philisophical oratories; the focus remains mainly on the fully adult characters or the evolution of the younger characters that we already know and how they are coping with the aftermath of the preceding books. The few new characters introduced by Martin are reasonably described according to the depth of their impact on the story.<br /><br />My only minor quibble with the book is that for the first time we end with a couple of cliffhangers of an immediate kind; prior to this book, Martin did a pretty good job of leaving off at places that were intriguing, but not in the middle of a life and death situation. Hopefully, these will be resolved as part of Book 4B -- I think it's a bit unreasonable to have to wait for more than a year to see whether or not a couple of the specific main characters live or die.<br /><br />In summary, if you enjoy the way Martin has richly developed his characters and story, and don't mind the reality that most people DON'T change that much (except, of course, for the younger characters who are evolving in ways that might surprise), and don't mind that you'll have to wait until next year to read about Danys, Jon, Tyrion and Stannis, amoungst others, you'll find much to deeply appreciate in this effort.st time we end with a couple of cliffhangers of an immediate kind; prior to this book, Martin did a pretty good job of leaving off at places that were intriguing, but not in the middle of a life and death situation.

B000B0WODA|4.0|As I type these words, the song Do You Want To plays through my computer speaker, and I sit here, tapping my foot. This is also the kind of music I'd enjoy driving to. In other words, it moves me, in a real good way.<br /><br />Initially, I was skeptical of the hype about this band. But as I gave them a listen, I realized that I was wrong about them. In fact, they have a true knack for catchy, melodious tunes (as do a number of their Scottish predecessors, such as Jesus and Mary Chain and the Pastels) and witty, clever lyrics. And watching them on Saturday Night Live a few weeks ago, I could see that they have real stage presence. The more I hear them, the more I really like them. Only time will tell if they are one of the greats, or merely a very good band of this decade. One thing seems clear, though, and that's that they're only getting better. So, I say, do believe the hype and check out Franz Ferdinand.

B0000029AP|5.0|I was recently saying to my wife, while watching clips of some recent Aerosmith live shows that, in spite of the direction they've gone in from the late 80s to the present, I'd like to go see them again. (I also asked her if she thought it would be possible to go for around $20. I must have paid somewhere between 10 and 20 bucks when I saw them during their glory days in the late 70s at Madison Square Garden, back when they were playing music like this. My wife was pretty sure that a ticket now costs quite a bit more.)<br /><br />I got into these guys during my 1st two years in high school (1975-77), and I have loved high energy, heavy guitar driven, blues based rock bands ever since. And really, what can I say about this era of the Aerosmith story, and this particular recording, other than that it sounds now as good as it did way back then. And while Walk This Way, Toys in the Attic, & Sweet Emotion are the big hits from this (and have been covered by everyone from REM, Tommy Shaw, Tracii Guns, and Run DMC to the much more obscure Wolfie, and the Butchers, among others) and are excellent, they should not obscure the power of such less acknowledged rockers as Uncle Salty (featuring some tasteful guitar playing courtesy of Joe Perry and the underrated Brad Whitford) and Adam's Apple, in which Steven Tyler shows what a 70s rock god he was. Other songs here are fine. For example, No More No More has that kind of Rolling Stones boogie sound that Aerosmith do very well. Round and Round is very heavy, and kind of anticipates ths early 90s grunge era (a link one can hear through later bands like Die Kreuzen, Mother Love Bone, Alice in Chains, Screaming Trees, etc). You See Me Crying is what a power ballad should be. And their delivery of the cover song here, Big Ten Inch Record, is still funny, albeit it an adolescent sort of way.Kudos also to the solid, non flashy rhythm section of Joey Kramer and Tom Hamilton for their playing throughout.<br /><br />It's no wonder that Aerosmith were so beloved, by Wayne and Garth, by the characters in the film Dazed and Confused, and by the kids in my high school and neigborhood, not to mention by me. Listening to this 70s hard rock classic brings out my inner 15 year old.o beloved, by Wayne and Garth, by the characters in the film Dazed and Confused, and by the kids in my high school and neigborhood, not to mention by me.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|So my roommate kept going on about some show called Firefly. To shut her up I said, \\"Uhuh, I'm sure it's great. Just don't forget to plug your headphones in while you watch it.\\" But somehow she roped me into a gathering of Firefly watchers. I saw the first three episodes, and was hooked. Last week she got half of the girls on my hall (I go to a women's college) obsessed with it. I don't think anyone has ever seen it and NOT had good things to say about the show.<br /><br />The script and the world it is set in are both amazing, thanks to Joss Whedon. Above all, however, the actors are the ones who really bring the show alive. I'd never heard of any of the actors before, but the characters are so believable. I love everything about this show.<br /><br />The only bad thing is that the show was canceled and there are so many unsolved things! However, Serenity the movie just came out, and hopefully two more movies will come  after that.<br /><br />I recommend Firefly to everyone! ....Although it probably is not a good idea to start watching around exam time..
0307276902|5.0|This book was spellbinding and impossible to put down. It is a remarkably frank and brutal book, too brutal, in my view for the middle schoolers that other reviewers have suggested be made to read it. Even among high schoolers, one ought to think a bit before handing it to them. On the other hand, if you would let your kid watch every scene in \\"Traffic\\" then you should hand them this book.  <br />This book is also, imo, essential to read before reading My Friend Leonard.  <br />I do have one reservation about this book.  It is written in a chronological fashion, pretty much day by day, and contains very detailed recollections of conversations, thoughts, etc. during those days.  As the book goes on, and after reading My Friend Leonard, you realize this book was written a few years after the events.  It made me question, not the essential or most shocking facts, but to what extent some of the details have been reimagined.  Of course, the author may have been able to reconstruct events with help from the institution where he rehabbed. Also, there are a couple of revelations, and so on, that occur, the timing of which also seemed very convenient for the narrative and I wonder to what extent the author/editor have managed the disclosure of them to enhance the narrative.
B000BW7QWW|1.0|I saw this movie in the theater with some friends of mine and while I was watching it I was so bored I thought I was going to fall asleep during the movie. I wasted nearly 2 hours and $6.50 that I can never get back! If I could I would give \\"Serenity\\" zero stars. My friends all liked this movie. I must have been the only one that didn't like it. Well that's all I'm going to say about this boring film. Gosh did this movie suck!!!
B000AP04FG|2.0|Actually, I like Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.  So much more my disappointment with this movie. The dialog tries to be snappy but came off to me as forced.  And the acting, well, both stars seemed to walk through their parts.  Jolie as Mrs. Smith just gives us her Laura Croft character and where, oh where, is that over the top acting the Brad Pitt does so well?  Both actors needed to crank it up a notch and give us some sizzle. <br /> <br />   The writer and director's gimmick of having the couple appear before a marriage counselor recaps the wonderful \\"When Harry Met Sally\\".  Yet it fails at humor.  Where there was chemistry between Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, there is ho-hum between Pitt and Jolie. <br /> <br /> Then there is the fight scene.   I don't think I'm giving much away because this part has been in the media.  I have rarely seen a more vicious and bad humored physical encounter between a man and a woman on screen; and this occurs in a movie which is trying to be tongue in cheek, if not actually humorous!  This would have been a great moment for a slapstick fight and some of those wonderful facial expressions that both Pitt and Jolie do really well.  This would have portrayed a couple who were angry but still in love.  <br /> <br /> I wish I could find something to complement about the film.  Alas, the picture of Pitt and Jolie on the DVD box is better than the movie itself. <br />
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This CD is a gem. John Mayer's considerable talent and maturity as a guitarist/songwriter is showcased beautifully and I'm thrilled he's taken this musical detour - whether temporary or permanent - into the blues/rock genre.  His voice is different to be sure, and it might be a little difficult for those who have a strong association of his voice with his pop hits to make the transition to a different style.  I think that's their loss.  If you like his voice and you like good blues, you'll probably like this CD.  Don't fear change.  :-)  I agree there are a couple of moments his voice doesn't gel perfectly with the style of music, but those are largely insignificant and forgivable in light of the overall excellence of the CD.  Comparing this blues/rock offering to \\"the greats\\" seems a little silly - He's not BB King, so he won't sound like him.  Step back and experience this CD for what it is: A great musical contribution from a very talented artist.

Now, having bought the album, and listened to it almost every day, I can say with assurance, this is the best band, and best album to come out in a long time. <br /> <br />Imaginative storytelling, mixed with Flowers' infectiously likable voice, a tinge of the 80's, synthasizer, gospel choir, and more, this is a band that cannot fail to delight. If you've heard just one of their songs and were impressed, buy the whole album, you won't be sorry. They have a fresh sound that has been badly needed; and I eagerly look forward to their next cd.

B0001LJCMK|1.0|Having bought this album on the basis of amazon.com reviews, I have to disagree with all the four-star givers out there. I'm a big fan of Rock, blues and country sounds among others inc. QOTSA but this album is POOR. For a start the songs are boring and uninspired. Jesse Hughes is no Josh Homme in the guitar, vocal or song writing stakes. The same effects are used on most of the tracks and the guitar sounds plastic and flakey. Also, Josh Homme is no Dave Grohl when it comes to hitting a drum kit, the beats are pretty lame. The recording is rushed and unlike certain great albums (like Beck's Mutations) which benefit from this approach, this album sounds like it came from somebody's parents garage. Apologies for being a hater but there are limits to my tolerance for lack-lustre, low-fi, low-effort, non-rock.

I don't understand how you could rate this anything below five stars. The whole point of this album was to group together his most commercially successful hits. That's exactly what he did. The only way anyone could rate this below five stars if Eminem messed up and replaced a single with a less POPular track. Eminem did a great job with this compilation of hit songs.

Thus, execution - the ability to get things done, particularly on a strategic level - has become the sine qua non of management science. Authors Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan observe that some people grow when promoted to executive leadership, while others merely swell. Those who lose touch with the operational realities of their businesses soon find themselves boldly leading a company going nowhere. The practical value of achieving objectives and getting things done must be instilled at every level of your company, and injected into the very DNA of your corporate culture. Anything less, and your company will under perform. Bossidy and Charan have sterling credentials when it comes to getting things done for America's leading corporations. They say execution is nothing more than faithfully practicing the right techniques with a disciplined approach.

B00005JNEI|4.0|I will never forget the first time I saw Michael Moore's anger-provoking film, Fahrenheit 9-11. It was June 2004, and I was sitting in a jam-packed theater in ultra-conservative Lancaster, PA. I went to see the movie with a buddy of mine, and the two of us were the only non-right wingers in the theater. We were also only two of a handful of people under the age of retirement in the theater as well. What my friend and I thought was well-placed sarcasm and humor, the right wing Republicans thought was anti-American, biased, Bush bashing. I remember laughing hysterically at certain points of the film...only to encounter the look of death from countless white, right-wing extremists who were dead-set on their blind patriotism. Upon leaving the theater, the real fun began as heated arguments escalated between spectators as they exited.    Regardless of your personal politics, or your thoughts on Iraq, or your thoughts on Michael Moore, the record needs to be set straight on a few things. Does Moore promote a particular agenda in this film? Yes, of course he does...as does Bush, Cheney, Rice, and Rumsfeld every single time they get in front of a TV camera for one of their photo-ops. Does Moore distort certain facts and stack the cards to favor his particular point of view? Yes, of course he does...as does Bush, Cheney, Rice, and Rumsfeld every single time they get in front of a TV camera for one of their photo-ops. Wouldn't it be nice if those mindless sheep (Republicans) who scream bloody murder over Moore's \\"factual inaccuracies\\" in F-911 would get equally heated and steamed everytime Bush or Cheney or Rumsfeld spout lies to the American people about war or weapons of mass destruction?    Those who oppose this movie have a particular agenda of their own...they want to stifle any and all opposition to the current militaristic, \\"my country right or wrong\\" philosophy that has an iron grip on this nation. To them, a free press and freedom of thought and speech is \\"dangerous\\"and \\"unpatriotic\\" and aids and abets \\"terrorists.\\"  What a joke!    Now...to the film itself. I have always liked the fact that Michael Moore dares to ask the tough questions to the people who most need to be asked them. However...Moore goes one step further and catches them on tape. Remember in Bowling for Columbine when Moore confronted Dick Clark and Charlton Heston over welfare-to-work policies and gun issues? Moore offers us another dose in F-911 when he camps out on the U.S. Capitol Building trying to encourage Congressmen to send their sons and daughters into the military to fight in Iraq. Their Congressmen's silence is deafening.    Moore employs plenty of his smart-alecky, sarcastic humor in Fahrenheit 9-11 to underscore several points: Bush's secret financial relationship with the Saudis, America's historic partnerships with Iraq and Bin Laden, the Bush Administration's botched response to the 9-11 Commission, the ridiculous \\"Coalition of the Willing\\" nonsense, the Patriot Act's true intentions, and the invasion of Iraq as a decoy and diversion.    As with all of Moore's films, Fahrenheit 9-11 mixes drama with satire, humor with gripping seriousness. The most poignant parts of the film deal with 9-11 survivors and their relatives and also the relatives of soldiers killed in Iraq. These scenes are almost too painful to watch.    F-911 has some fairly violent and distrubing images, however. One scene shows footage of a public decapitation in Saudi Arabia, and there are several other scenes that depict images of innocent civilians injured and maimed or even killed in the current Iraq war.     The only part of 9-11 that I thought should have been left out was the first 10 minutes of the film when Moore recounts the Bush presidency from Election Day 2000 up until September 10, 2001. It is clear that this was intended to smear and humiliate Bush, and served no overall meaningful purpose in critiquing Bush's policies post-911.    Overall, if you are open-mindedand want to explore the current situation in Iraq from a different angle than the everyday spin you get on Fox News, then this film is definitely worth checking out. The DVD is packed with plenty of nice extras, including footage on the release of F-911 and the notoriety it garnered. There is also a great extra on Arab American comedians and how they have incorporated the post-911 backlash against Arabs into their routines. Other extras include footage of Condoleeza Rice's cherade in front of the 9/11 Commission and Bush's press conference spin following his private meeting with the 9/11 Commission, along with a segment on Abu Ghraib and the handling of prisoners by Army personnel.     Freedom of speech is a wonderful thing, isn't it?

B0007ACVHI|5.0|In my VW Beetle CD changer, I stuffed the Ma, the Wispelwey and Kliegel  CD's of the Bach Suites and hit the road for a 5 hour commute (round-trip) to Atlanta.  I had just purchased the Kliegel because of price AND the way she plays the Chopin Sonata. <br /> <br />The Ma I have always liked a lot, while one of my cello teachers had introduced me to Wispelwey.  I have other recordings, some historically accurate, and some just hysterical.  Of all the Wispelwey seemed to me much more \\"Bachish\\", and I still enjoyed the Ma. <br /> <br />During the trip I found myself punching up one version and another over and over again.   <br /> <br />What really confused me is that I could always tell when it was Ma...beautiful tone...but the Kliegel and Wispelwey were sort of similar, without being alike. <br /> <br />Finally discovered that, to me, the Kliegel was more musical, without losing the baroque bowing traditions. Character.  Now I really want to hear her in person.
B0006L16N8|3.0|First off, I do agree that the lyrics in this album is somewhat lacking, but that doesn't mean that chris martin never wrote bad lyrics.  The title track of ROBTTH has one of my favorite lines in all of musicdom: \\"I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war.  If you can tell me something worth fighting for.\\"  Lyrics, in my opinion, doesn't get much better than that.<br /><br />But enough sidetracking, on to the review.<br /><br />This cd bores me.  I can fall asleep to it.  The first two albums somehow managed to convey a sense of urgency, like that I NEEDED to listen to this cd.  X&Y doesn't have it.  It is like Chris looked around, saw the huge stacks of money, the cars, and mansions, and stopped caring.  This happens a lot to artists who start out good, but popularity causes them to stop caring. There are a few good songs, though.  \\"Fix You\\", \\"Square One\\", and \\"Til Kingdom Come\\" are all very solid, but it justs put me to sleep.

0553801503|1.0|First let me say that I have been an enthralled reader of George R.R. Martin's \\"A Song Of Ice And Fire\\" series.  I think the first three novels are among the best in the fantasy category.  IMHO, they outrank almost everything except Tolkien and C.S. Lewis.  I have been eagerly awaiting the next volume in the series ever since I finished reading  \\"A Storm of Swords\\" just days after it was published. <br /> <br />I'm very sorry, therefore, to have to say that \\"A Feast For Crows\\" is a huge disappointment.  In a nutshell, George Martin has caught \\"Robert Jordan Disease.\\"  This book loses the reader in a boring, threadless maze of little vignettes mostly devoted to two-dimensional, minor characters.  Most of the major characters are missing----and Martin's explanation that this is because he \\"had\\" to break what he had written into two volumes due to length just doesn't hold water.  The plot is lost.  Character development is mostly absent.  The writing is perfunctory at best.  I didn't come even close to finding myself on the edge of my chair in the way I did with virtually every page of the previous volumes.  <br /> <br />Martin says he is finishing the story for some characters in this book, and will finish for the others in the next--a big error, IMHO.  Assuming two books were really necessary, far greater interest would have been generated by moving the entire story part way along in one volume and finishing it all in the next.  It's more likely, however, that what was really needed was much better editing, resulting in a single, large volume at the same level of quality on display in the earlier books. <br /> <br />At a minimum, I would recommend saving your money now, waiting to buy this book more cheaply in paperback, and reading it only when the promised additional volume comes out.  I fear, though, that unless the writing in the next book is dramatically improved, the promise of the first three volumes may remain unfulfilled.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I really do enjoy this cd. I had it playing in my car for a couple of days (and for me thats just strange) I like the intermission too. from start to finish, i like the overall composition song to song. the band and studio did a good job with this debut. good luck with the sophmore album!
0743265289|4.0|My disclaimer, and I think it's a useful one:  I used this book.  I took the test.  My (unofficial--haven't gotten the official report yet) score was 740, which was somewhere in the realm of 98th percentile, and about where I was wanting to end up.  I don't think that the book is responsible for all of this, but I'm definitely in the realm of test-takers it's targeting.  If you're *not* aiming for 700+, I'm pretty sure there are more useful books out there. <br /> <br />For my own purposes, however, I would say this book was good.  I would suggest getting it, a general book, and the PowerPrep software from the GMAT people and using all of them.  Do as many questions as you have time for.  The harder ones will help.  Do not, after that point, be surprised if the questions on the test don't seem nearly as hard as they ought to be--that almost sent me into a panic, when I neared the end of each section and things still seemed too easy to be doing well.  It's okay. <br /> <br />No matter what method you use, you're going to need solid math and English skills to begin with.  This can't give you those, but it's a good way to get used to the maddening sentence correction and data sufficiency questions that are like nothing you've ever had before.  Time and practice and the brain you were born with will get you the best possible score, so I'd skip the expensive prep courses.  You can find the easy-to-middling questions elsewhere, the hard ones here, and once you've finished this set, the test will be much less intimidating.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|\\"Gilmore Girls: Season 5\\" is the best season yet of this beloved show for one simple reason: Luke and Lorelai.  It finally happens, but not without struggle and heartbreak.  This season is also a little controversial because Rory begins her downward spiral which only ends(?) with her bottoming out in season 6.  My favorite episode is probably \\"Wrtten in the Stars\\", a lovely, deceptively sweet show when Luke ardently proclaims his love and Lorelai is subtly equivocal, thus setting up the smash-up in the middle of the season.  Other soon to be legendary episodes are \\"Wedding Bell Blues\\", the 100th episode, when Emily and Christopher nearly succeed in destroying Luke and Lorelai; \\"Pulp Friction\\", the real reconciliation episode; and of course the season finale \\"A House is Not a Home\\", where Rory finally loses it after a mind screw-over courtesy of the Huntzberger family. (I wonder; is that supposed to remind us of the Sulzbergers of the \\"New York Times\\"?  What did that newspaper ever do to Amy Sherman-Palladino, hmm?)  This is just a classic TV series, and I shouldn't have to remind men that it features two very hot actresses; winsome Alexis Bledel, and the staggeringly charismatic Lauren Graham.  If you are looking for a place to begin with the \\"Gilmore Girls world, season 5 is a choice place to start.

B000A59PMO|5.0|\\"Veronica Mars\\" is a remarkable melding of genres--it's noir disguised as teen soap opera--and its young star, Kristen Bell is a real find.  This show is genuinely dark, intricately plotted, and brilliantly written. (If it were on a larger network than UPN, no doubt these qualities would have gotten it cancelled long ago.)  And Bell appears to be able to do anything.  She's great at comedy, tears your heart out at the tragic moments, all while nicely underplaying in the best noir tradition.  She's even able to subtly suggest that Veronica is a flawed, even damaged character because of her ordeals, and is groping towards some normality and redemption.  If Sarah Michelle Gellar is really tired of playing Buffy, it looks like Joss Whedon has found his new star.  So, \\"Arrested Development\\" fans who are distraught over the axing of their favorite series; come on over to \\"Veronica Mars.\\"  It's so fine.
B00005JNZJ|4.0|Wow, we've got some people that are hard to please!  Haven't you been exposed to the ways of Hollywood enough yet?  When there is something you LOVE, and they are going to make a movie out of it, how often is it incredible?  The VAST majority of the time you have to lower your expectations because the movie version IS going to be worse than the book, comic, etc.  Aeon Flux does a decent job of showing the cartoon in live action picture.  Does it do it justice?  Well, probably not, but is it a good science fiction movie?  YES, it is.  The next question has to be what sacrifices were made to bring this to the big screen, and are they acceptable?  If you like science fiction movies that deal with post-apocolyptic Earth, then I truly believe you will enjoy this.  Films like Planet of the Apes (old, not new crap), Omega Man, Soylent Green, Mad Max/Road Warrior, Wizards and the Matrix, if you like these I think you will be entertained, and may even really enjoy Aeon Flux.  If you don't like stories like those  mentioned, then you will NOT like this, and if you think the cartoon was incredible, then you may be disappointed in this.  Hey, this is just because I care man.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|HAVEN'T THEY MADE ENOUGH MONEY!? korn obviously felt they needed to make drastic changes because their sales had dropped over their last couple albums. why does every metal band that starts to struggle (except sevendust. their last album was their heaviest.) turn to \\"SELLING OUT\\" (i.e. selling their soul.) it's an obvious ploy to sell more albums and tap into a new fan base. WHY THE HELL AREN'T YOUR DIE HARD FANS GOOD ENOUGH?  <br />KORN, you guys have made your money, let me give you some advice, every album you make from here on in, try to make it as good AND AS HEAVY as your first. stick with that and you will always have the die hards that were there from the beginning when you were playing at places like the AUD in Worcester MASS. then you could retire a proud band and say \\"with the exception of that one crap album the other side, we never sold our souls to the pathetic pop industry. these guys have been my favorite band since their debut album. every album since then i've loved or really liked, it's devestating when your favorite band COMPLETELY disappoints you!

0670033375|3.0|The book deals with some fundemental environmental problemms of past and present societies. The title however is misleading because most of the book is dealing simply with environmental problems of cultures that did not collapse, and it is not well connected to the first part, where collapsing societies are discussed. While the chapters on Easter island, the Anasazzi and Greenland are convincing and well researched and written, the others, especially the Maya, are surprisingly lacking in detail and rigour.  <br />The second part reads like a shopping list of environmental problems and as such, even though it is accurate and important, is boring and irrelevant to the questions of collapse. <br />All in all one of Diamond's weaker efforts

And indeed, the movie is everything I expected and more. If your main concern is the same as mine was before I saw it: \\"will the movie really be good?\\" then you can rest easy, because its awesome. You won't be dissappointed. Matrix my butt, this movie's fight scenes are much better. I only wish there were more of the movie to watch, but oh well, all good things come to an end. Thank you Square Enix for making this awesome movie.

B000BYRCH4|4.0|And of course, you get to see Jessica Alba in a bikini, and that's pretty much the only reason I saw this film! I went into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it. So I was very interested in the plot and what was going to happen. Because if you know the plot of this film then it spoils the movie for you. Because this movie is about finding the plot, and where they are going to go with the characters. <br /> <br />As far as acting goes, Paul Walker is just an ok actor judging by this performance. I wouldn't say he's awful but it's clearly his body that got him this role and not his charm or skill. Jessica Alba however, is one of the best actresses whose been handed roles lately that don't amount to her calibur. Did anyone here watch her on Dark Angel? To me, that was the only time where she was great. Since then, she's been handed roles like this, where she has very few moments where she can actually act. The rest is just mindless action and that's what made Fantastic Four a bad movie. This movie however, had a good plot to it and I don't want to go into it because like I said above, it'd spoil the movie and take the mystery out of Into the Blue. But every guy should watch this to see Jessica in a bikini and every girl should watch this for Paul Walker. Enough said.
B0000DKMK0|5.0|I purchased this Japanese DVD from XploitedCinema.com I went to VideoHelp.com and got directons on how to make my DVD player region free.

B00005CDNK|5.0|Abba was, from the very beginning, a great singles group.  They matured into great album makers, and their last three full-length studio recordings are all great from beginning to end.  This, their last, proved that they still had a lot to offer, and they went out on a high note.  Especially notable here is the inclusion of \\"The Day Before You Came\\" as a bonus track.  It showed that, had they wanted to, Abba could have become a major force in techno-pop, believe it or not.  It is a beautiful song based on a simple keyboard and drum-machine backing, with fantastic vocals by Agneta. <br /> <br />But the whole album is strong, The Visitors, When All Is Said and Done, Head Over Heels, One of Us--all worthy of inclusion among their greatest.  But also tender ballads, \\"I let the Music Speak,\\" \\"Like an Angel Passing Through My Room\\"--gorgeous.  This was the first Abba Remaster that I bought when it came out, and it would be worth it for double the price.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|Korn has proven that they have staying power and can outlast their imitators. Korn's many copycats once plagued the nu-metal scene but have now gone extinct, and Korn had a hand in inventing rap-metal but then left that genre behind like the dead dog it is.  They're still around because they continue to look forward and stretch the limits of their sound. After the loss of founding guitarist Head (I wonder if his \\"conversion\\" is going to stick), remaining guitarist Munky wisely decided not to cheat by doubling up multiple guitar parts in the studio. Munky's more sparse sound here is actually an interesting development for Korn, bringing stronger songwriting to the forefront.  Also, Fieldy now has room to get more subtle and nimble on bass, not relying so much on his traditional madcap slapping.<br /><br />The missing extra guitar has been effectively replaced by experiments in industrial and electronica, with general over-production from The Matrix. In some ways, these new sounds offer a strong new direction for Korn, but in other ways there are signs that they have turned down a dead-end road. The songs that most benefit from the new approach are the powerful \\"Hypocrites,\\" which is the album's strongest track, and the ambitious \\"Open Up,\\" which truly sounds like nothing else in Korn's history. But on the other hand, the electronics are a real problem for tracks like the awful \\"Throw Me Away\\" and the cluttered \\"Love Song,\\" which sound like the typical industrial deathmarches that were being churned out by Nine Inch Nails (or even worse, Filter) a decade ago. Not to mention, the synthesized beats detract attention from the always-improving David Silveria (one of the most criminally under-appreciated drummers in rock).<br /><br />Unfortunately, simply adding synth squiggles and noisy fake beats to the existing Korn sound is not really progress, but clutter, and I'd be surprised if they can do much more with this new direction on future albums. But in the end, there is an even more important improvement on this album, and that concerns Jonathan Davis. Like the band itself, Jonathan has buried the army of imitators who once tried to latch onto the manic-depressive goth-metal vocal style that he mostly created himself, and he continues to expand his emotional range (the best example here is the surprisingly effective power ballad \\"Tearjerker\\"). And Jonathan has finally &#8211; FINALLY &#8211; expanded his lyrics beyond his typical griping about his lousy childhood, tackling a great many personal and social issues on this album with real depth and exploration.

0451191153|4.0|Here's a helpful hint: When a person makes an argument as obviously flawed as the one I just made (see two reviews below), it's likely he/she is making fun of someone (in this case paranoid negative reviewers who don't know the definition of \\"fascism\\"). So, why don't you think about that, john smith, before you go patting yourself on the back for nothing.
B000BTJCRM|5.0|Listening to this album was like situating myself in the theatre of the Gods of rock. And then my brain exploded. <br /> <br />Can't say enough about these guys. If you love rock (and I mean serious, unabashed, good old honest 'lets put the c*ck in rock' ROCK), then get this album. It's not going to be for everyone (let's face it - if you think Norah Jones is the best thing since sliced bread, this might not be your cup of tea), however if you enjoy big hair, bigger riffs and gargantuan songs, give it a listen.
0393324818|5.0|Michael Lewis' interest covering outliers (trailblazers later) brings him to the land of baseball, where the old guard is well entrenched and the barriers to entry of new philosophies high.    In the middle of it all is the Oakland A's manager Billy Beane, the strongest proponent of statistics-based evaluation of players (a.k.a \\"Moneyball\\"). Ironically, Beane's baseball career is Exhibit A of the foibles of the \\"if it stands like a ball player, looks like a ball player then it is a baseball player\\" school of baseball thought.    The central theme of this book is not at all new as Bill James published his theories of sabermetrics way back in 1977. However, this has only been recently been put to practice not only by the A's but the Dodgers (ex-GM Paul de Podesta), Blue Jays (JP Ricciardi) - Beane disciplies all.    The theory is quite interesting as it attempts not to reverse but to extend current baseball thought. ERA for instance, long held as the metric for which pitchers are judged, is not that accurate as it may be padded by inherited runs. A more apt metric is the no. of home runs, strikeouts and walks (not hits) - stats that a pitcher has direct control over. The book provides quite a convincing argument as to why the no. of hits given up by the pitcher are not influenced by factors other than, get this - LUCK!    Batters on the other hand should be judged by one stat alone - On Base Percentage (OBP). The book provides a good argument as to why steals, sacrifice bunts and flies are anathema to winning baseball.    All in all, Billy Beane's practices do end up making winning teams out of a limited budget but up to a certain extent only as former diamonds in the rough tend to command large free agent contracts thereafter and the GM has to rebuild from scratch. I'd characterize it more as the art of treading water with a limited budget as it still needs a large financial commitment from the ownership to create dynasties.     It would be interesting to see the Yankees employ Moneyball for the moneyed. Still, if all of baseball would finally get it then we're back to square one - being that money-laden teams having the advantage.
B00005JOHI|5.0|After hearing sterling reviews, I decided to find out what all the fuss was about. I am SO glad I did. The music lets you know right from the beginning that this is a love story/epic, and uses period-style melodies that draw you into the narrative. The attention to period detail hasn't been so impressive since Polanski's \\"Tess\\". And the acting couldn't be more pitch-perfect. Indeed, Keira Knightly was the headstrong yet vulnerable Lizzie, and Matt MacFadyen managed to get better looking as the film went on, to the point that it was almost a distraction. We are seeing Darcy through Lizzie's eyes. Wonderful supporting performances from Brenda Blethyn, Donald Sutherland, and a particularly bitchy Dame Judi Dench, as well as everyone else, certainly add to this most pleasurable film experience. I'm hoping the Academy won't write this off as just another adaptation of a classic. This film can stand on its own as entertainment right alongside any of 'em. The DVD is terrific.
B000B7HZXM|1.0|Stewart's renditions of these timeless classics are simply wretched. I can't imagine what made him think he could compare to Louis Armstrong, Johnny Hartman, or any of the other musicians whose legacies he desecrates. Listening to Rod Stewart sing these songs is like setting fire to a Van Gogh. If you like this music, please seek out the originals on which these arrangements are based. If people keep buying this garbage, he's likely to create more of it, and who knows what classic tunes he'll destroy next.
078401213X|2.0|How this piece of art-house schlock ever came to be seriously respected is totally beyond me. Darren Aronofsky's big claim to fame (along with Requiem for a Dream), features Sean Gullette as an obsessed math genius determined to find a pattern in the inner-workings of the stock market, I guess so that he can get really rich. It's implausible that an individual as devoted to \\"ideas\\" as he claims to be would be so motivated to apply his talent to such a parasitic end, but hey, I guess audiences don't think brilliance is cool anymore unless you use it to hit the big time, which explains the obsession with the Las Vegas card counting geniuses from MIT. Aronofsky's style isn't quite as obnoxious as it would later be in Requiem for a Dream, but it's certainly obnoxious all the same, preferring to film his subject with grainy BW photography and lots of film-schoolish trick shots and fast cutting. Aronofsky ultimately fails to heighten the tension to the extent that he so clearly wishes, he strives for profundity, but Pi remains a simple (albeit moderately clever) thriller, nothing more. The scenes with Gullette and his mentor are well done and kept me interested despite the repetition.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|These ratings are for the MOVIES, not the DVD releases. I agree, the 30th anniversary edition is NO better than the 25th anniversary edition, but so what? If you don't own this movie yet, buy whichever version you want. Don't rate the movie one star because you don't like that the studios puts out multiple DVD's of it. <br />   How anyone could rate Jaws lower that 5 stars on Amazon is beyond me. If Jaws is not worthy of 5 stars, than NO movie is. Jaws is ABSOLUTELY one of the 5 best movies ever made, its just what position on your top five list it lands in thats variable. <br />   Jaws is not a movie for anyone younger than 12, it is just too darn scary. Your kids won't go swimming after seeing this, so wait until they hit the teen years. <br />   Its kind of strange calling this a horror movie, since there are no ghosts or supernatural occurences, but a horror movie it is. In fact, it is the BEST horror movie ever made (Exorcist comes in #2). For sheer scares and tension throughout the movie, Exorcist can't compete with Jaws. If you haven't seen this movie yet, be prepared to get the hell scared out of you. If you have already seen it, its a movie that holds up through countless viewings. Buy the DVD already!

B000002KIE|1.0|Put some make-up on, mess-up your hair, bite your lower lip, and play like crap...that's the formula used by the Sex Pistols on this, the most pathetic testament to noise pollution since \\"Dr. Zaius Sings The Monkees.\\"  The problem with punk rock in general is that it's soooo phony, and there's nothing denying that here.  The anger is forced, the music boring, and the message is a cliche wrapped in a Bazooka Joe comic.  If you're a mall chick who just got cut from the pom-pom team, this album might make you feel better.  But, if you appreciate true music from the heart, don't bother.
B00005JO04|3.0|Ambitious statement from writer-director Stephen Gaghan (Traffic) about the ongoing clash between America's oil companies and the Middle East. Gaghan's film incorporates multiple story lines which he is only barely able to hold together in his portrait of what is now called \\"The Clash of Civilizations,\\" but the film's incoherence may in fact be its strength, as Gaghan correctly refuses to provide simple answers about the oil companies, the US government, and Islamic fundamentalism. He forces the viewer to immerse himself in a chaotic realm, a realm of greed, betrayal, and conflicting values. George Clooney gives probably his most likeable performance to date as Bob Barnes, a CIA operative in Beirut who is captured and tortured, and then sold out by the government. Matt Damon is also good as a corporate analyst determined to make a splash off of a family tragedy with a Gulf prince, and Jeffrey Wright plays a corporate lawyer trying to aid the merger of two major oil companies. All of the acting is solid, and the footage of the Middle East is quite beautiful, yet it evokes the danger and uncertainty of the region. Syriana unfortunately suffers from largely poor and amateurish directing (Gaghan's first attempt at filming his script), employing I suppose a cinema verite mode of shaky cam, trying to recapture the feel of a documentary, but its only comes across as contrived and self-aggrandizing. Syriana is a triumph of content not form, and it is probably the most provocative and important Hollywood movie of the year.

It is also the last book I read to him every night before bed when he sleeps over at my house. He just loves the calming rythme and the soothing words. At 2-years-old, he is beginning to recite the words on his own. It is so wonderful to see him loving something that is not noisy and battery-charged! I know that he will love this for some time to come, and perhaps even pass it on someday. As for me, I love the classicly drawn illustrations (alternating black and white with color) and the coziness of it all.

B00005JO1J|1.0|This movie was nothing short of distastful and disgusting. There were children in the theatre for goodness sake! The amount of sexuality and drug use portrayed in this film should have warrented AT LEAST an \\"R\\" rating! If not \\"X\\".    We're talking EXPLICIT strip club scenes, syringes, transvestites, heavy GRAPHIC drug usage, sexual situations, death, and VERY foul language.    Adults can subject themselves at their own will, but children should NOT be allowed to see this in the theatres. I am sure many regretful parents have gotten out of their seats mid-film, to remove their now-scarred children from this hell-hole of a movie. They go in with the intention of educating their children both culturally and socially with a Broadway musical, and come away trying to explain how people can possibly justify such deranged behavior.    I understand the value it holds in terms of awareness for AIDS education. The manner in which the storyline was performed, however, was a bit much. People should be able to know what they are getting themselves into when they purchase a movie ticket. Several co-workers of mine feel the same way. They had no idea what they were going to see in this movie. The previews and trailers were VERY misleading!    This is Sodom and Gomorrah depicted on the big screen. Difficult topics are shoved in your face in a VERY disgusting manner.

B00006RINF|2.0|To the unitiated, Italian rock/metal outfit Lacuna Coil might sound like they're cashing in on the \\"dark rock\\" trend set by American whinge-rock pioneers Evanescence, even though Lacuna Coil have been doing their thing years before Amy Lee and Evanescence decide to start whining-, I mean singing. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Lacuna Coil suffer from the same flaw that Evanescence does: a talented singer stuck with a mediocre band. Musically, \\"Comalies\\" is mostly bereft of any creativity, and seems aimed directly into the midst of the mainstream. As a result, most tracks come of as being repetitive, unimaginative, and worst of all, just plain boring. <br /> <br />Whether or not this band can be considered \\"metal\\" is up for debate. There's nary a riff to be found, and the guitars lack any aggressiveness or bite; they're just there as if by force of habit. The drumming is incredibly simplistic; there are no fills or any creativity behind the kit at all. The bland noises generated by the guitars and drums would be befitting of some horrid nu-metal band, except that Lacuna Coil decided throw a healthy (and by healthy I mean WAY too much) dose of keyboard effects into the mix. This horrid batch of synthesized defecation absolutely ruins the experience; keyboards are best used in a subtle manner, yet Lacuna Coil throws them about over nearly every track. I don't know if this was to cover up their lack of musical talent, but their overuse drags down the album as a whole. <br /> <br />The track sequencing is suspect as well. The two best tracks, \\"Swamped\\" and \\"Heaven's a Lie\\" are placed right at the beginning. This promises the unsuspecting listener more of the same, but \\"Comalies\\" quickly descends into an empty spiral (ahahahaha) of mediocrity and boredom from which it never recovers. It displays the disturbing trend of mainstream albums to throw on one or two \\"singles\\" on the album and leave the rest as pure filler. <br /> <br />And while Cristina Scabbia might be a good vocalist, the band simply relegates her to mere eye candy and doesn't let her sing enough. But maybe I'm biased in this regard, because there's another singer, Andrea Ferro, who apparently took his inspiration from Chester Bennington. His loud wailings are indescribably horrible; if you thought Tuomas singing on Nightwish's debut \\"Angels Fall First\\" was bad and detracted from the music, wait until you hear this! The best parts of \\"Comalies\\" are where Ferro keeps his mouth shut. <br /> <br />I cannot honestly recommend this album, and any self-described metalhead would do best to stay away from it, as it is more Power Pop than metal. Lacuna Coil is just another band whose desire for mainstream success robbed them of their creativity. Pass on this one.
0156027321|5.0|This book absoultely blew me away. I was skeptical through the whole thing, but the story (and humor) kept me going and then--wow!--what an ending! I immediately started over again at page 1, and it was like reading a whole different book the second time My favorite passage is the comparison between owning a hotel and a zoo--at a zoo, the guests never leave, they never pay, they're super-picky about food, and they definitely don't get along and play well with others. Hilarious. This book will keep you thinking for a long timed afterward.
B00009ATKS|5.0|This isn't the best music to drive to, but when you want to just sit down and relax its the way to go.  The music grows and shifts finding beautiful chords come out of dissonance, which make them become even greater.  I don't belive in drugs but Mogwai is also great when you trip.
B000BJS4BM|5.0|Of course, like other Madonna devotees, I was out in force to pick up her newest studio outing \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\" last month.  The album surpassed any expectations I had, so imagine my glee when I realized there would a \\"expanded\\" version being released during the month of December.<br /><br />To be fair, I gave Mariah's \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" re-release only three stars.  This was due to how it was marketed as a partially \\"new record\\". But this expanded version of Madonna's new album is clearly aimed for the Madonna devotee, & succeeds on that merit alone.<br /><br />Housed in a sturdy, book-shaped black slipcase, you get the album, with one new track \\"Fighting Spirit\\".<br /><br />\\"Fighting Spirit\\" sounds like an \\"American Life\\" leftover, Mirwais of course helming the production.  But it seems that the track was given a re-newed spirit for the \\"Confessions\\" re-release.  Lyrically, in the vein of the material from \\"American Life\\" the acoustic elements abound, in a quiet sense, & a dance element is brought to the fore. The tolling bells give it a haunting feel.<br /><br />Now, that is great...but I personally wanted this due to the amazing 40-page booklet of Steven Klein's COMPLETE photography of the \\"Confessions\\" photoshoot, which is of course breathtaking.  Wish Madonna would've stayed with the red hair! You also get an empty journal with lyrics in the lower right hand corner from \\"Like It Or Not\\" (regular cut from \\"Confessions\\"). And a one month trial membership to Madonna's official fanclub, ICON.<br /><br />All in all, this is for the Madonna purist/hardcore person you love this holiday season! They may've bought the original album, but they will love the expanded version. Die-hards need only apply!
B000021Y7X|5.0|I LOVE this DVD. This is such a wonderful performance! I love how it begins, with just David Byrne and a ghetto blaster next to him playing a loop....Then Tina Weymouth for a bit of \\"Heaven\\" to a stage being set up for one of the best rock performances I have ever seen!! And I have not got tired of watching it either!! A usually pricey item (I think I paid nearly $30) it is worth every dollar!!!
B00092QSM8|4.0|This is my first Foo Fighters album. I like it, despite Best Of You being a little overplayed. The first CD is a set of solid rock songs with distorted guitar, the second CD features often spacious acoustic songs.  <br /> <br />Amazon does not provide much information as to WHICH import edition you are buying; it could be either the UK 2 CD edition or the Japanese 2 CD edition--other editions I don't know about. Both of these would include the bonus track The Sign, which is a heavy, driving, and melodic song, up to the standards of the rest of the album. <br /> <br />My Japanese version has standard Compact Discs, without the digital rights management (DRM) software found on the US edition. This is nice for anyone who doesn't want a headache putting the music on iPod and/or dislikes being forced to to allow cloaked rootkit software that secretly sends information about your computer and use of this music to Sony via the internet.  <br /> <br />It also has an extra booklet with the lyrics in English and translated into Japanese.
B000000OAH|4.0|This is a varied and interesting album.  I'm not sure there are many other bands that could mix up musical styles the way that Queen do here. <br /> <br />The album starts off with \\"Mustapha\\" with Freddie singing in some strange middle eastern spiritual kind of way, before Brian's guitar comes in about half way through to heavy it up.  A really distinct track. <br /> <br />Most people would have heard \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" so there's not much point going into detail here.  Great guitar and harmonies in the chorus.  Lot's of fun. <br /> <br />\\"Jealousy\\" is a Freddie piano ballad with some strange modal playing by Brian.  Haunting. <br /> <br />\\"Bicycle Race\\" - everybody knows this one.  Great use of ringing bells in the middle. <br /> <br />\\"Let Me Entertain You\\" - A good Queen rocker with fun lyrics..tongue in cheek. <br /> <br />\\"Dead on Time\\" - A really fast Brian May rocker..great guitar <br /> <br />The second half of the album slows down and we get a variety of ballads.. the Seventyish sounding 'Only Seven days\\"..the soulful and sad \\"Leaving home ain't Easy\\" and \\"Dreamer's Ball\\", a jazzy style ballad. <br /> <br />\\"Don't stop Me Now\\" is the only fast song on the second half and is a fantastic  piece with a sense of play in the lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"Fun It\\" is a Roger song and you can see from the disco type beat here that it was only a small step away from \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" <br /> <br />The final song \\"More of that Jazz\\" is an adventurous piece with splices of the \\"highlights\\" of the album thrown in for good measure. <br /> <br />Whilst this offering isn't as solid as \\"A Night at the Opera\\" it is certainly an entertaining and varied piece of work. <br /> <br />More than worthy of a listen. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AGTPUU|1.0|What could have been an exceptional move became mediocre! <br />The adult characters in the movie are either grotesque or loud & in the kids face or both. <br />Instead of being kindly of face the elfs are old & mean looking. <br />Several scenes appear to be there purely to induce an adrenaline flow. <br />aSoaringHawk
B00006LLJ4|5.0|'Minority Report' by Philip K. Dick is my all time favorite story. I love the story of how Anderton was framed or so he thinks. I also really enjoy this movie, although a lot was added and changed in this film. One of the main things that was changed is that the person Anderton is supposed to kill in this movie isn't who it says he is supposed to kill in the original short story/book by PKD. Anyone that has read the book before watching this movie will automatically know the differences between the book and film. But that is not at all saying that this movie was bad. In some ways, some of the changes and additions actually added to the story.<br /><br />Tom Cruise comes off as a really smooth John Anderton and Colin Farrel does a good Whitwer. These characters and their fates were changed for the movie, but I guess it's hard to make a 2 hour and 25 minute out of a story that is barely 100 pages long. lol. The movie doesn't drag at all and the pace of excitement is constant and good throughout the film. Although once again different from the book, I like the dark side that is shown in this film about John.<br /><br />The special effects of the film are incredible. From John jumping from car to car to just the visions of the Pre-Cogs, the film really does bring the story to life. And the music performed by John Williams only adds to the setting. This is some of the best music I have heard from Williams. Great stuff.<br /><br />Overall, a great movie that I think most fans of Dick's book/short story will enjoy. I did and I'm a huge fan of the real story by Philip.
B0000636UN|5.0|I listen to this one over and over, from start to finish.    It starts out with a couple of electric radio hits   (\\"Steve McQueen\\" and \\"Soak up the Sun\\").    These tunes are catchy, with nice vocal harmonies   and very good instrumentation.    However, what I like best about this CD is the deep tracks.  \\"Abilene\\", \\"It's Only Love\\", and \\"Weather Channel\\" have a   more acoustic instrumentation, and the lyrics and vocals   are touching and poetic.     \\"Weather Channel\\" is a very nice, mellow track.    Nice finger-picked acoustic guitar work here.
B0000U5RNU|4.0|You take a dark haired Rowan with a real british accent, put him in a suit and set him in a Bond like scenario and you got a great Bond spoof. Between the two recent spy comedies, Austin Powers and this, this feels more like a Bond film than Austin.<br /><br />The movie is funny at a lot of parts, but then it does have a few dull moments. Rowan does a fantastic job, as he usually does, as the lead Johnny English; the spy who was chosen for this specific mission because all of the other spies are dead. My personal favorite scene is when Johnny accidentally interrupts the wrong funeral.<br /><br />Overall a good film, but maybe not as good as the Austin Powers trilogy. But Atkinson fans will love this film.
B00005UW7V|1.0|This was a big yawner. The annoying child star who is in every movie requiring a child star shows up again here. The 'mother' doesn't like him or want him, yet suddenly she decides to permenantly program him to love her? There was no sign at all that she had taken to him. We are then subjected to an eternity of him chasing after The Blue Fairy who will make everything right. Interjected of course with Jude Law's appearance as a Sleaze robot. Yawn.<br /><br />Yawn.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This is an excellent collection of Pink Floyd's work, not only because it spans their entire career and features a heavy dose of pre-\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" recordings, but also because it provides a fresh perspective on the material. For those of us who have listened to these songs in their original formats a thousand times, it's refreshing to hear \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" now roll into \\"Time\\" instead of \\"Welcome to the Machine,\\" or hear \\"One of These Days\\" flow into \\"Us and Them.\\" It's like hearing it all brand new, and only a couple of the new mixes sound at all forced. I wouldn't give up the original albums for all the tea in China, but this collection gives me an alternative way of experiencing Floyd's uniquely homogeneous style. The highlight for me is the string of \\"Echoes,\\" \\"Hey You,\\" \\"Marooned,\\" \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" and \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" on disc 1. This would make half of a great concept album all by itself.    That having been said, this clearly sets the stage for another collection, because a number of essential Floyd tracks--including \\"Run Like Hell,\\" \\"Not Now John,\\" \\"Young Lust,\\" and \\"Have A Cigar\\"--are missing. Can you say Echoes II? Let's hope.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I have been a hardcore maggot for about six years now and I have to say this is one of the best albums ever made, to me, and I am sure others agree with me. I do not understand what the hell nu-metal is or what idiot even came up with it but SlipKnoT is NOT NU-METAL! I dont even consider that a genre...anyways I love the fact that this album happens to sound different almost through every song, you're not getting the same song over and over again. The aggression and brutality is still all there just in different form from the other albums. I for one am glad that they threw in a couple acoustic songs, that sets more of a mood to the album showing that besides complete raw emotion, there is also the real slower human side to the album, it shows, to me, the process of the realistic mind, and it's not all just a one-sided emotion during the whole album. The guitars are even heavier on this album than previous, and the kick-ass insane drumming from Joey is still there. The only thing about the drumming is you cannot really hear Joey's double-kick so well. But you can hear the percussion a lot better and a little more clearly this time around. I cannot stand how these people always say \\" oh this is Stone Sour now, this is nothing along the lines of SlipKnoT. \\" Well that is a load of crap. This is SLIPKOT, all who cannot evolve and open their minds to bands who wish change to keep them going, can all just close your ears and move out of the way and go back to listening to all your bands that make the same exact album everytime. Anyways, SlipKnoT is Sabbath to me, and they have changed and impacted metal forever. They keep doing every album and the next album will be even better. AND NO SLIPKNOT HAS NOT BROKEN UP, SO LETS NOT GET THIS CRAP GOING ABOUT THEM BREAKING UP!!!!!! THEY ARE JUST DOING OTHER THINGS FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS, I KNOW ALL THE REAL MAGGOTS THAT KEEP UP WITH THINGS ALREADY KNOW THAT, KEEP THE HORNS UP AND HEAD BANGING!!!!
0553801503|2.0|I will start this review by  stating that the previous three books by Martin are among the very best books I have ever read. That being said I believe that the love for the other books kept me reading on in this one. Whereas I could not put down the other three books, I had to force myself to read thorugh some of the chapters in this book. I was really disappointed in A Feast for Crows.  <br /> <br />First I was disappointed in the lack of content on the existing characters that we have grown to love. There is little development on the Stark daughters and no content on Dany or Tyrion (although we are promised that on book 5). Jon Snow and the Wall and left out of this book as well. The focus of the book is on Kings Landing, however Cersei and Jaime are really the only main characters to write about. The chapters on them are what continued to drive me to read. The chapters on Brienne the Boring were tedious at best. I do not why Martin decided to add Brienne's traveling to the main story line. Alot of time in this book was spent on detailing the travel of the characters over long distances with no real development. Some of these chapters could be cut out and the reader or the book would suffer none.  <br /> <br />Another problem I had with this book is its lack of real content. The book is almost 700 pages and has only one real plot twist at the end. One thing that I had come to love is the plot twists in all of Martin's preceding books. Martin's unpredictability ensured that you did not know what was going to happen next. This book was also missing that element.  This book seemed to only set up the future stroy lines. I can only hope that book 5 is not the same way for ther other characters. It also introduces too many Sers and lords that have no bearing on the story line but only make thebook thicker. Martin had much of the same in the other books but somehow it seemed so much more tedious in this book.   <br /> <br />I have been anticipating this book I soon as Iclosed A Storm of Swords. A Feast for Crows falls short of the standards Martin has set for this series. To be fair the book carried lofty expectations following the previous installments. After I finished this book it really left a bad taste in my mouth. My biggest fear is that Martin will become another one of those authors that begins a brilliant tale but is unable to finish (i.e. Robert Jordan). If so the next books could be much of the same. That would be a shame. I can only hope that the future books are able to recapture the same kind of magic the first three books possessed.

B00005ASHM|2.0|Any one who knows anything about real music knows that Mike Love; was, is, and always will be; the head, heart and soul of the Beach Boys. The essential element that made the 'Boys' great was always a little thing called \\"charisma,\\" and Love has it in spades. It's something your're either born with or your're not, and he is definitely a \\"with.\\" Brian Wilson is an adequate bass player and a 'decent' writer of experimental/novelty songs, but he is hardly the genuis he's made out to be.....He didn't write \\"Kokomo, he didn't arrange the Fat-Boys to collaborate on the hilarious 'crossover' hit \\"Wipeout,\\"... and he absolutely CAN NOT work an audience like Love They are MUCH better without him,(and frankly)all of the Wilsons.  Stamos is a much better drummer than Dennis, Bruce Johnson has that 'million dollar smile,' and stage presence galore, and Jardine always did all of the guitar 'heavy-lifting,' not Carl....I do not miss Brian, or his marginal talents, at all in concert(which is where the 'Boys always mattered most anyway.)
0552149519|5.0|Wanting to see what all the hubub was surrounding it, I decided to read Dan Brown's controversial \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" I had listened to those who were both for and against it, but wanted to read it before I came to my own conclusions about it.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I found it to be an exciting and emotionally-charged mystery thriller, well written and fast-paced. While I don't agree with the theories and beliefs presented, they do make a fascinating element for this type of mystery novel. The characters are well-rounded and full of life, and the excitement never lets go. You'll want to continue the adventure until it's dramatic conclusion. Fans of of the mystery thriller will not be disappointed in \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\"<br /><br />Grade: A-
B00006SFLV|5.0|\\"My so called life\\" is for everybody who has ever been 15 years old.  <br /> <br />...And if I wasn't currently finishing college and needing every cent I can get my hands on I'd by this DVD set without question.  <br /> <br />\\"My so called life\\" is the world we all live in, the fantasies we all share and the friends we love and hate at the same time. <br /> <br />This show may not be high concept or ground breaking but it treats the world of the characters with the utmost honesty and nostalgia as one who looks back on their own high school years. <br /> <br />Too bad it costs more than the whole \\"Roswell\\" collection (which of course, I own).
B000BJS4BM|5.0|Madonna hits another career high with her latest full-length album release.  The Special Edition release of \\"CONFESSIOND ON A DANCE FLOOR\\" is in no way disappointing and poignant.  The sturdy slip-cover packaging includes a beautiful 42-page picture album featuring a beautiful layout by distinguished photographer Steven Klein of Madonna under the disco-lights, the additional 80-page diary is just a lot of fun.  The Special Edition print of the CD features the bonus single \\"Fight Spirit\\".  This is a stunning addition to a true enthusiast collection -- and well worth it.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I first started listening to Depeche Mode after they released \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" which by the way is my favorite album. Songs \\"In your room\\" and \\"walking in my shoes\\" were the ones to grab my attention. I liked how they combined rock and electronics to create really unique sound with great melodies. <br />\\"Playing the Angel\\" for me is their best album since then, although I liked \\"Ultra\\" and \\"Exciter\\" as well.  <br />The song I like the most from this album, but it had to grow on me, is \\"Damaged people\\". I think it has really nice melody and great lyrics. \\"John the Revelator\\" is the song that stood out the most after I first listened to the album. My other favorites are \\"The Sinner In Me\\", Suffer Well\\", \\"Precious\\", \\"Nothing's Impossible\\" and \\"The Darkest Star\\". <br />I gave the album the rating of 4 since 5 for me would be the albums \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" and \\"Violator\\".
B00005JO04|5.0|Every now and again a movie comes along that illustrates a perspective that will embarass and annoy the establishment. This is such a movie.  <br /> <br />Clooney as always gives excellent value and its' great to see Matt Damon handle a more mature role so well. Even the cinematography shines. <br /> <br />All the performances knit together beautifully and this film will become a classic in time.  <br /> <br />If you don't like politics, don't like to think too deeply or are very much a supporter of the political right or oil companies, you may not like - but you might enjoy or even appreciate the perspective.
0671646788|2.0|I've read/listened to numerous similar books, but I only got a few pages into this book before i lost interest.  although there were a lot of examples(which can be good sometimes), the book was very repetitive and had too many examples. the book would have been better if the author had cut out a lot of the fluff and just given his tips for improvement.
0061015725|4.0|This book is certainly one of the best works Crichton has come out with. There are a number of things which make Prey an interesting read, by and large this book offers both the sci-fi enthusiast as well as the average suspense reader to partake in its excitement!<br /><br />The story follows the main character Jack around as he slowly but surely winds up in a life or death struggle with high technology. The beginning of this book is perhaps the most engaging aspect as we're introduced to a main character that is a stay at home dad as well as an all around nice guy. His wife, on the contrary, is a heavy weight corporate type that never spends anytime with the children and somehow manages to keep her relationship with her husband going throughout the years. This doesn't last... not exactly.<br /><br />From the very beginning of the book the two core characters - Jack and his wife - are pitted against one another as Jack begins to suspect his wife of having an affair. Little does he know that what is also going on is that the high tech company she works for (using a technology he created), is releasing a highly technological toxin into the atmosphere. Jack is mysteriously brought into the situation, unaware and completely unprepared for the events that transpire throughout the novel.<br /><br />Without going into too much detail it should be noted that this novel is more detailed than your average suspense/action book, and yet at times Crichton gets ahead of himself and manages for a few paragraphs to go on and on about either a technology he himself created for the book, or a technology with is merely theorized about in the real world (this can be slightly distracting for those that aren't used to Michael Crichton's works). It is true when many reviewers have said this book is a real page turner, you're bound to get so hooked that you'll spend an entire night just trying to finish it!<br /><br />Prey is not without flaws however, one annoying thing about the book is that the action sequences seemed a bit rushed. Not only that but the way in which the nanotechnology operates at times (and fights back) seems a bit, well, too human... more importantly, it seems a bit foolish. Crichton often mentions how these barbaric ways of fighting are \\"efficient\\" for killing purposes, and yet even by man's standards they simply are not (body slamming and choking comes to mind from the novel). It truly seems as though Crichton rushed to put all of his great ideas on paper without actually considering how interesting he made (or failed to make) them sound.<br /><br />Another fault with the book has also been mentioned in the past: with the exception of the main character most of the characters in the book seem rather flat. This is of course not without reason, as Crichton introduces a myriad of characters and it would have taken him far longer to go into detailed accounts as to each of their histories and personalities, yet I would have liked to have read that. Yet given the novel was a classic action/suspense read, this is easily forgivable.<br /><br />I'm giving this book a 4.5/5 for its great story, plot, and action scenes - a true page turner as I previously stated, and yet I felt there was something missing on the description end of it as far as the characters were concerned. I'm also inclined to feel as though the ending was a bit rushed. Regardless, a great read!book is that the action sequences seemed a bit rushed.

0880796863|5.0|The original R.W. pack is the perfect way to learn Tarot.  This pack matched with all my books, and made my journey into understanding these astonishing cards easier.  I am now considering other decks to expand my knowledge/horizons, but will always consider this my \\"main deck.\\"
B000AP04FG|1.0|Well I wasn't expecting too much when I went to go see Mr. & Mrs. Smith at a friend's house, after all it features two decent actors, one of which (Brad Pitt) who has been in really bad films as of late. To top it off, putting the words \\"spy\\" and \\"comedy\\" together, at the most I was hoping for was a laugh or two and a lot of action.<br /><br />Unfortunately this film doesn't even deliver the small amount of goods necessary to make it a decent action picture.<br /><br />As reviewers have mentioned before the sound on the DVD is atrocious, in fact it's so bad that I can understand if people got up and left in the middle of the theater. My friend has a decent sound system hooked up to his DVD player and television and still we were straining to hear it. The problem with the audio doesn't end there though; the dialogue itself is what you'd expect from a modern day spy comedy... just downright idiotic. Based on the dialogue alone the movie was obviously made simply to give nods to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.<br /><br />Well so the film is just one of those actor-fan-flock type movies, how about the actual story? It wasn't terrible it could have been presented much better though. You have two assassins that are married that are under the assumption that their spouse has a relatively normal job. The problem occurs when we're given silly scenarios such as Angelina Jolie coming home and changing from a dominatrix outfit beside Brad Pitt, and Brad Pitt seemingly not noticing simply because he's a few feet away. Doesn't he know she owns that kind of clothing? Are we to take it for granted that he questions her loyalty in the relationship merely because they are seeing a marriage councilor?<br /><br />I suppose if you like Mr. No Personality Brad Pitt then you won't mind his character, who like him has absolutely no personality (I don't mean to disrespect Brad Pitt entirely, he's been in some wonderful films but as of late he seems to be developing amnesia because he keeps forgetting that his characters should have /some/ personality). As for Angelina Jolie? Absolutely stunning as always, flashing smiles, big round lips... well, that's exactly what you got here, no other character personality traits can be described because there are none to mention!<br /><br />I suppose in the end what matters is whether or not this comedy delivers both from as a decent action film as well as a comedy. The cinematographers and artistic designers must have been hard at work, because admittedly the sets were very pretty (and that's all that could be said about them), but that alone doesn't carry a movie - the action sequences were absurd, too fast, without justification, and probably required no more than half a second worth of movement on the part of the actors.<br /><br />The comedy in the movie is what got me really upset though... what exactly was so enjoyable about anything the characters did or said? The fact that Angelina has her weapons inside the kitchen sink, is that supposed to be laugh-out-loud-funny? Is it funny that she is whipping a masochist, playing the S&M bit while trying to obtain information from him right before she assassinates him? That isn't the least bit humorous to me. The lines in this movie are not witty, cute, or funny... at the very least they are insulting to the average intelligent viewer. I read one reviewer describe how they feel that two assassins attending a marriage councilor was, in and of itself, a real \\"hoot,\\" no offense but that's the most absurd thing I've ever heard.<br /><br />Many more reviewers state that this movie at least had a lot of \\"sexual\\" undertones, and was a \\"sexy\\" movie in the way the characters acted and the way it was presented. If you find Angelina Jolie wearing sexy clothing to be sexy, as many people do, then you'll undoubtedly find this movie \\"sexy.\\" If like me you think \\"sexy\\" in a movie refers to an intellectual sort of lustily appeal, than you will no doubt find these comments to be ridiculous, maybe in the 70s and 60s they were stylish and sexy but in a movie like this they just come across as pathetic.<br /><br />Of course this review is going to generate a lot of \\"Not Helpful\\" remarks simply because people disagree with me, not because they actually find my opinion helpful or not (a common practice on Amazon when you disagree with someone, silence out the opposition). Oh well, too bad too... people should know what they're getting into before they see this movie. This movie features a lot of celebrity fluff and might only be enjoyable to those who enjoy watching \\"Access Hollywood\\" and like reading about celebrity life... after all, this movie is one big giant nod to the ultra famous celebrities acting in it. The movie itself is just horrible.d sexy but in a movie like this they just come across as pathetic.

038533348X|2.0|Cat's Cradle has little to offer but Kurt Vonnegut's very pessimistic assessment of religion, politics, and love.  The characters are just \\"types,\\" and so incompletely sketched that we can't care what happens to any of them.  The plot brings together an assortment of these characters - for no apparent reason at all - to an island for a doomsday scenario.  After the scenario plays out, we receive from Vonnegut the valuable intelligence that all of mankind's effort is meaningless and absurd, and that the best we can hope for is a good laugh at the joke that God has played on us.  Most readers will have no reason to trouble with this inconsequential work.
B00003CXCT|4.0|As many other people have already said in their reviews, this set will likely be hated by \\"original fans\\". As I wasn't born yet when the original movies were released, I've never seen the \\"real\\" ones. The only ones I've seen were this and the Special Edition. Simply put, if you saw the original movies in the theaters in 1977, you won't like this.    For everyone else, (like me) it's problably the best thing that's happend to Star Wars in a long time. The effects have never been better. Other things were fixed as well. My favorite change is Boba Fett's (now done by Temuera Morrison)voice. It's more realistic, him being a clone. It also sounds cool. Another change is Ian McDiarmid's face instead of Clive Revill's. This, in my opinion, was for the better.
0553801503|2.0|I am sorry to give this book a poor review.  I LOVED the previous three books, five stars each, but this book does not live up to expectation.<br /><br />The many criticisms you've heard about the book's disjointed nature are true.  I keenly felt the absence of prior characters.  In addition, the author's difficulty in writing the book comes through.<br /><br />It took Martin more than five years to write this book, and it's obvious to me.  He doesn't know where he wants to take us. I was often struck by how I had to press on - which was a sharp contrast with the prior volumes where sleep was a nuisance since it kept me from reading.<br /><br />The kindest thing that I can say about many of the chapters of this volume is that they may be necessary to get to where the author ultimately wants to take us, and though tedious, are a necessary evil.  The worst that I can say is that the author may be milking the story for money.<br /><br />By way of explanation for the redacted version of the story, Martin writes, \\"I felt that the readers would be better served by a book that told all the story for half the characters, rather than half the story for all the characters.\\"  He further consoles that \\"there's more to come. [We can expect a]nother book as big as this one.\\"  That's cold comfort to me since this was the shortest of the four books.  Furthermore, the idea that book HAD to be split is preposterous.  Lengthy books are published all of the time.  The idea that it is being done for our, the readers, benefit is insulting to our intellect. This book is a money grab.<br /><br />The author and publishers made the conscious decision to double their profits, by splitting the book in two.  I was prepared to give this a pass, but the story suffers for it and the difficulty Martin faces of where to take the story next is exasperated by it.<br /><br />Also, the only characters that appear from the previous history are Arya, Jamie, Sam and Sansa. The rest are new perspectives (though they may not be new characters, e.g., Cersei).  The new perspectives, in large part, are necessary to give the reader an understanding of what is happening in different parts of the realm, but it has the unfortunate effect of bloating a once-concise and riveting series into a meandering mess.  This is not to say that whole series is ruined by FEAST, but that with this addition the series has taken a noticeable departure from what preceded it.<br /><br />All told, this book falls far short of the greatness of the previous three.  I recommend - since you will certainly read it at this point - that you wait for paperback.<br /><br />P.S. - Please Mr. Martin, let's have no more comparisons between how long it took you and how long it took Tolkien to finish his work.  Tolkien's work at least delivered the goods after the wait.  You have compromised your \\"art\\" for money.  Classy.ough they may not be new characters, e.g., Cersei).

B000002IZ4|5.0|in my opinion the best album front to back of all time. How someone was able to compile this masterpiece is beyond me. Seriously, don't even hesitate for 2 seconds before buying this cd.
B000AADYUI|5.0|There was once a time when people felt the future was a wave waiting to come ashore. Brilliant musicianship, and euphoric interaction. Well worth the wait.
0679422714|4.0|\\"You can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs,\\" Stalin is said to have replied to a critic of his collectivization program that cost twenty-million Russians their lives.  Mao's policies got his total up to sixty-million, or more.  How high would his score have to had been for his present-day admirers to admit that he was no Gandhi?  And, by the way, people aren't eggs!     Apologists for Mao need to read this book for the other side of the story.
0385513755|5.0|First of all I would recommend to buy the Illustrated Edition. The illustrations inside give a new dimension to the book. Dan Brown's easy-going descriptive language and illustrations made me feel like I have visited and seen all the places with my own eyes. I am not a huge fan of thrillers, but this one is brilliant, although I enjoyed more a totally new point of view on Christianity and Jesus - the ultimate mystery, than the action of the thriller. I have also discovered many interesting facts about Da Vinci and other people and places that I was not aware of.<br />The book is a good treat for both, mystery addicts and thrillers lovers as well
B000B8QEYC|5.0|This new CD is a gem in the crown of this beautiful woman with a beautiful voice. I never tire of her CD's that I have had for years and this is a VERY welcome addition to that collection. This CD is wonderful from the first track to the last and my favorite on it is \\"If I could be where you are\\". But then, it is difficult to pick a favorite from this CD. They all shine. If you have ever liked any music that is Celtic or any music that Enya has done in the past, buy this CD!! Even for the average music lover this is one of the best, if not the best CD's just out on the market. I know this is a CD that I will be listening to again and again!
B00003CXCT|5.0|In 1977 I was 6 years old.  One of my earliest memories is waiting in line to see this movie just after my 6th birthday.  All summer vacation was spent playing with the action figures, flying my X-wing and having whiffle ball bat lightsaber duels with Mark down the street.  Does anyone remember nearly freezing his fingers off re-enacting the Battle of Hoth out in the snow? What about finding that long lost Snowtrooper figure after the first spring thaw?  Leia in the slave girl outfit?  C'mon guys, you know what I'm talking about.  Star Wars was life.<br /><br />The opening scene of the \\"first\\" movie, where you see Princess Leia's ship come into view, dazzles the eye.  You think to yourself, \\"look at the size of that thing.\\"  Then, seconds later, Vader's cruiser proceeds to swallow up your entire field of vision making the first ship look like a life boat trying to escape the Titanic's death throes.  You knew you were in for a wild ride.<br /><br />As for the re-makes, well done.  It gives the original fans a beautiful remake to watch and gives new fans a prettier film to see.  Younger viewers spoiled by today's technology won't be so quick to dismiss these films and cheesy and poorly made when comparing them to 'The Lord of the Rings' and God help me 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'.  I shudder to think of anyone comparing Harrison Ford's brash Han Solo to Depp's creepy Willy Wonka.<br /><br />To me, the original trilogy is just more fun to watch.  The acting is a little better.  The characters are more likable.  They get rid of the silly Ewok song at the end of 'Jedi'.  No Jake Lloyd.  All solid reasons to pick up this boxed set.  And on your way home, swing by the toy store and pick up a brand new whiffle ball bat.  You'll thank yourself later.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall has to be one of the best albums of all time. The concept is just completely genius and makes you think about what each song actually means. The music has a very sonic, spacey atmosphere and is a pleasure to listen to (especially David Gilmour's brilliant guitar work), and best of all it is filled with classic, timeless songs. Sure the introludes do get anoying, but because of the albums concept even they mean something in the story, best song is \\"Young Lust\\", great song for driving around in the city at night. I recommend this album to any rock fan.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|sadly, i was introduced to this movie by a chinese friend of mine and he was outrageous that i didnt watch it as a korean.. and he was right for a change..<br /><br />The main reason i loved this movie is because the style of the director (Chanook Park) encaptures the audience through well-disciplined camera work unlike any other korean directors were able to do.. The film seems to have a natural flow to the storyline aided by smooth transitions and fitting music.. The acting, headed by Minshik Choi as Oh Daesu, was terrific..<br /><br />I was surprised to hear that \\"Old Boy\\" did not get as much hype in korea even though i believe it's one of the finest korean films to date.. Hopefully the 3rd installment of the trilogy will follow in the steps of \\"old boy\\" and not \\"sympathy for mr. vengeance\\"..<br /><br />Oh yea, don't let children watch it because the movie will scar them for life.. just like watching the \\"Chucky\\" series did for me.. :]
B000002J0B|5.0|Houses of the Holy is a good album for any mood. A lot of the songs are fun, upbeat and catchy, some of the others are slower for mellower moods, and overall this is a great album. E Produced Zeppelin classics like \\"Over The Hills...\\", \\"Dancing Days\\", and my favorite LZ song \\"The Ocean\\".
0735619670|5.0|This is an excellent book. Software life cycle can be divided into multiple stages: requirements specification, architectural design, writing code, testing and deployment. This book is covering one stage of the software life cycle, which is software construction (writing code). <br />The book is great, giving a lot of real world's statistical data to support and explain each point. <br />The book covers software construction in a great detail, explaining and discussing every possible point related to writing code.  <br />The only criticism that was said about this book is that it didn't mention or discuss security related issues in code construction, but I think that this doesn't decrease the value of the book. <br />
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This album is a breath of fresh air in the metal scene today. It has everything you need, great lyrics, riffs, drums and a bonus...guitar solos!!! Yes, guitar solos. Growing up in the 70s and 80s, one could always expect great solos from most of the bands from that era. Some of todays newer bands are good and they can play the guitar, but can they really play the guitar?? Either they can't or they don't want to. Whatever the reason, they should sit back and listen to these guys and sit in awe! These guys deliver the goods, kick butt and take names. \\"Bat Country\\" is one of my favorites while \\"Trashed and Scattered\\" just rips up the alleys. \\"Sieze the Day\\" is a nice slower track before cranking into \\"Sidewinder\\". If you are looking for an exceptional album, look no further. Seriously, there is not a bad song on this disc. Enjoy!
0140277447|5.0|Very good and accurate protryal of the Japanese disgraceful conduct in Nanking. <br />Its a shame there are still Japanese cockroaches who deny what they had done in Nanking as well as atrocities commited on an immense proportion of the earth.....1931 in Manchuria - Unit 721 human experimtatations, to the Phillipines in 1942 -Bataan death march  To Burma - Burma railroad where 20,000 POWS perished, To India, To the outer borders of Australia, to New Guiene, To singapore, To Java, To Indochina....you name it. <br /> <br />1 in 3 Britsh died, 1 in 4 Australians died, 1 in 5 Americans died....for Asian POWS, OVER HALF of them perished. <br /> <br />3% of Britsh, American and French died in German POW camps. But prisoners of the Japanese, 33% of prisoners died. <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|There is not one single wasted word, image, or sound in this bracingly beautiful love story.  Like all of the best, it rips at your heart with a wrenching, soulful ache that will not end with the credits.  Heath Ledger is simply perfect, as are virtually all of the actors in this film; Ang Lee again nails a place and a time (Sense & Sensibility) with razor-sharp attention to the detail.  I so hope that people everywhere will see this movie - it is much bigger than a \\"gay romance\\" - it is about holding things in; about all of the things that keep us from what we want and who we love; it is about all of us.  And don't fight the choke in your throat, just cry.  It's one of those rare things in life that is truly - cathartic.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|What's all this I hear about people complaining about the so-called \\"revamped\\" Star Wars movies?  They're the same movies, just with subtle effects changes.  I can't believe so many people are moaning and groaning about an added laserbolt at the end of Greedo's blaster...you people are in serious need of finding jobs, all of you. <br /> <br />I've been a fan of the movies since the mid 90s (I was only 12 at the time), when the trilogy was re-released to VHS.  Seeing it on my TV was one thing...seeing it in theaters for the first time in 1997 was something entirely different. <br /> <br />Since that time, there have been several additions made to the trilogy, the latest being the ones made for this release.   I won't go into them at this time, but it's kind of lame how people act like Lucas ruined his franchise.  You people just have very high expectations.  Well, make your own movie and then you can criticize.
B00005JO1J|3.0|I loved the musical RENT - it caught you off-guard, and its characters inhabited their world with a gritty urban quality that is all but lost in the film version.  While the score is transferred nicely - the richest songs intact and sung expertly by the entire cast, including newcomer Rosario Dawson - the setting and staging of the story seems at times completely out of whack.  It all looks way too pretty for the lower East Side of the late '80s.  It is truly a \\"fantasy world\\", and once you decide to accept it on its own terms, you will have a good time.  But so much of the urgency in this story is now dated, and though the players give it their best, it seems an almost wildly overblown treatment of a rather simple musical.
B00006AG5N|4.0|My review is based on two different things. First is the music, this compilation is a good place for new Elvis fans to begin, not much here for older fans unless you want the remix of conversation. Second is this garbage saying that Elvis was a racist, just because you do not like Elvis or his music is an absolute pitiful excuse to accuse him of such crap. Elvis did good things for many, many people, and many people still adore his music and legend. So just because you do not like him or your ashamed to say you know people who do, does not mean you have to share your negative views with us.<br /><br />By the way, this album is awesome. Go buy it now!!
B000BZISPI|4.0|In some ways, I think I liked the old one better.  While the first version (with Gene Wilder as Wonka) altered and shortened the plot quite a bit, this version -- though it is, in most other respects, wonderfully consistent with the book -- altered Willy Wonka's character.  Roald Dahl depicts Wonka as a slightly eccentric fellow, unfazed by anything, delightfully delighted with his inventions.  The old movie shows Wonka excited about his inventions, though Gene Wilder was a little too old to dance around \\"like a kid at Christmas\\".  In this version, though Johnny Depp was certainly young and spry enough to play Dahl's character perfectly, his script has him mentally disturbed by memories of a terrible childhood at which Roald Dahl never hints.  And the writers, in an attempt to add some \\"family value\\" to a story that has stood quite well as pure fun alone, changed the ending in a way that degraded the quality of the plot.<br /><br />It was still a great movie, and I enjoyed it.  Standing apart from the book, it's fun.  Set alongside it, it's surpassingly admirable.  It is quite rare these days that we find a movie based on a book so incredibly similar in plot to the original work.  However, it's surprising how strong the contrast is between their rigid adherence to Dahl's plot and their extreme reconstruction of Wonka's character.
0393037010|5.0|A recent reviewer pans the Aubrey/Maturin books based on a disappointing and frustrating read of Master and Commander.  I would agree with the reviewer that the issue of nautical terminology is frustrating but that has been solved by several excellent reference works designed specifically to alleviate this issue.   <br /> <br />The reviewers more damning criticism is partially true but ultimately misleading as a criticism of the series.  Master and Commander, the first of the series, is more like a Horatio Hornblower story than a true Aubrey/Maturin novel. It is far more action packed than the remaining books and emphasises naval combat over character development, biological exploration and history. The \\"real\\" beginning of the 20 volume set is Post Captain, the second volume in the series and it is far more characteristic of the series.  O'Brian himself commented that he had not intended to write a series when he did Master and Commander.  His thinking obviously changed before Post Captain was written.  If you are turned off by Master and Commander but like historical novels with a hint of Jane Austin, stay the course and sail on to Post Captain. It is far more subtle and much better written. If you don't like that one then head for land but don't judge the series by the unique first volume.  It's too bad they named the movie after the first volume (even though the movie has nothing to do with the first story) as many folks will start with that atypical book.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Here is a review of the songs in Meteora <br /> <br />Foreward- you cant grade this because all it is is shattering glass and thunder. It is an opening to Dont Stay. <br /> <br />Dont Stay- 9/10. This song is a really loud song. From the Stay Away From Me! to the Without Apology. Overall it is a very good song. It could have had a better ending. <br /> <br />Somewhere I Belong- 8/10 This is a realy good song. It has been played on the radio a lot. Even though it is loud, it is one of LP's quiter songs. For one thing, there are no Extremely loud screams, like one step closer's Shut up when i'm talkin' to you! <br />I dont know why, but this song reminded me of In the End. The chorus is repatative. <br /> <br />Lying From You- 9.9/10 This is the second best song on this album, and the third best LP song. The opening violin samples are really something to listen to. The Buzzsaw Guitar explodes in the beging. This is probably the most original song LP Has done. The \\"Very worst part of you, the very worst part of you! IS ME!\\" Is incredible. Some say this song reminds them of Crawling from Hybrid Theory. I personally cant see that. A really good song. Perfect for parties. <br /> <br />Hit The Floor- 7/10 Definatly not the best song that has been done by LP. The opening guitar sequance is nothing new. It is a very anoying scratchy guitar. The Chorus is, however, not bad. It sounds good and the \\"One minute your on top!\\" Is really good. But the rest of the song is just okay. <br /> <br />Easier to Run- 6.5/10- I definatly am not crazy of this song. The chorus needs work to be done. The \\"If i could change i would, ect.\\" is very good though. This is LP's Secong softest song. <br /> <br />Faint- 9/10- Wow. The opening violin is Awsome! It is a very inspiring song. LP's Second loudest song. Perfect for Huge parties. If you have a good sound system, make sure you play this song at top volume. If you have something like home theater setup, and you turn it all the way up, your windows will fall off. This songs main line is, \\"I wont be ignored!\\" Hearing this line at top volume is something to cherish. And kiss your windows good bye. <br /> <br />Figure.09- 8/10 This is a really good song. It reminded me of One step Closer. The chorus's are really fast. The words leading up to the chorus are excellent as well. Like the \\"Just Like Before...\\" Of one step closer. The \\"Never goes away, AND NOW. Are all really good. This song probably wont become a hit at your party. <br /> <br />Breaking The Habit- 9.5/10 Probably the most famous and original LP Song, Breaking the Habit is a song about suicide. It is a very well written song. The chorus is not cheesy as many say. It has haunted lyrics that will make you want to play this song over and over again. <br /> <br />From the inside- 6/10 I dont know about this song, i have never been too fond of it. The chorus is cheesy, and the lyrics sung by chestor just dont seem to fit. But the instrumentals in this song are Excelent. <br /> <br />Nobody's Listening- 7/10 This is a rap song. The japanese flutes are a good insert to LP's variaty. Chestors screams are pretty good his lyrics are kinda cheesy. Mikes vocals are excelent though. <br /> <br />Session- 6/10 It is just a DJ's work. It was used in the matrix reloaded. This song cant be catagorized. If you have iTunes, make sure you change it to Unclassified. <br /> <br />Numb- 10/10 The crown of the album. This song is easilly the best song on this album. This is not The best LP Song. The opening DJ work is really good. It has never been done. This song is different from other LP Songs because, for one thing it has no raps. The second thing is that the song is about problems that children and parents have everyday. Parents sometimes expect to much out of their children. This song will be a party Hit! <br /> <br />So what can i say. This is a really good album and an even better band. I wont give it 5 stars because some of their songs could use some work. <br />Some people also seem angry at LP, they say, they have no originality and suck. \\"I cant beilieve Metallica actually toured with these people\\" says someone. I think people are angry at LP Because they get more publicity that lets say Lamb of God. Lamb of God is a good band, but they dont get nearly as much publicity as LP Does.  <br /> <br />Over all, this album is a really good one, definatly worth a purchase. If you liked this album, you would LOVE Hybrid Theory.

B000BP86OG|5.0|The more I listen to this new Darkness CD, well... the more I listen to this new Darkness CD.  The songs as a set are so much better than the first release.  Originally, I found myself skipping the 5th (Seemed Like a Good Idea) song (slowest one on the album) and now I am to the point where I listen either to the whole thing or I skip back to song 6 to hear 6 & 7, which, IMO are stellar songs.  I still LOVE the title track... and the more I listen, the more I hear little Queenisms all through the album, though still in general it's a more complete full album than most Queen albums were (as Queen did create ALOT of filler to go with their great songs).  The sound on this album is so classic, it makes you think late 70s and early 80s, but with the crisp clean modern day production.  The mixing is more old-school too... not just all downtuned and uber heavy and more bass filled... they let the guitars shine the most, and more modern mixers need lessons in doing that!  This is just darn catchy hard rock.  The second song, Knockers originally bugged me a bit with the over the top vocals, but I'd say that was only for the first two listens and then I was infected with it singing it around the house in my mind.  Not only do I get used to Justin's voice on repeat listens... it's to the point where I actually really LIKE IT ALOT... mainly because it is so different from anything else out there... it's a nice change of pace... and the production and songs on this album really make the best use of his high voice yet.  In fact, I think it is fair to say this album uses his higher registers much more appropriately within a song than the first one did.  One thing I wish they would improve is the lyrics/subject matter of the songs.  Not that they are bad, in fact they are quite clever... BUT... it sort of hurts a great song sonically to listen to it and then later read the lyrics to find out all it is about is \\"not going bald\\", \\"or the flabby arms of an older lady\\".  (OF course there are deeper meanings, they are not THAT simplistic... but still, what could be an absolute perfect song often has to lose a few points from the lyrics being so corny).  The good thing is the catchiness is so great you find yourself listening to the sound more than the actual words... in fact, here and there you just pick up things by hearing a word stand out here and there (like, did I just hear him sing about having the \\"runs\\" in one spot?)  I think \\"Bald\\" is the best song on the album... its so cool sounding... and without reading the lyrics, I had no freaking idea they were saying \\"BALD!\\" in the chorus.  Song 6, \\"Hazel Eyes\\" where the vocals are a bit over the top, has top notch music that is rather deep and layered, and I think is about the catchiest song on the album... I just love the sound of the guitars on it... and if you dont find yourself humming it later, you can bet it is because you are consciously trying not to.  It is sonic candy.  Unlike the first Darkness album which was two great songs, one very good song, and a bunch I found completely forgettable (though not necessarily bad), with this one, I think it's a great and instantly classic album start to finish...ere are deeper meanings, they are not THAT simplistic... but still, what could be an absolute perfect song often has to lose a few points from the lyrics being so corny).

B00005JNTX|3.0|Parts of this film were brilliant, other parts rancid. It's got one of the sharpest looks I've seen in a film in some time. Based on a comic novel, it keeps the depthless surface of its source and used the original material as a storyboard. Miller did the comic, and his codirection credit was a nod to his originality, because the credits say Rodriguez \\"shot and cut\\" the film (i.e., he directed it). The post-noir pornoviolent excess has been likened to \\"Pulp Fiction\\" by Quentin Tarantino, who \\"guest directed\\" one sequence (Rodriguez is his protege; parts of this could be called \\"Kill Bill Three\\"). Its source might be better dated back to Kubrick's \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" (1971), if that film had stayed with strictly storyboarded visuals, drained the Beethoven and color, and stayed with just the pornoviolence. A triptych of three episodes set in the same dystopian alternate world, the film follows the fatalistic misadventures of three antiheroes played by Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke (who got the best reviews), and Clive Owen. Of the three, I liked Owen the best: he had the spaced out look of a comic character, and registered not a single thought behind his eyes. As for whether it's worth seeing, you'll have to decide whether the film's vile, scummy view of humanity is a worthy tradeoff for the startling look at a bizarrely original world.
B0002OERI0|3.0|I'm not sure what to really make of this album. <br />Sure it's different from their older stuff but that's not always a bad thing... <br />so i'll rate the songs instead: <br /> <br />1.AMERICAN IDIOT: A lot of people think green day,think american idiot because its that repesents them at the moment. <br /> <br />2.JESUS OF SUBURBIA:Thought it was a bit long winded at first, but ive grown to like it. <br /> <br />3.HOLIDAY:Used to be my favourite but i overplayed it and now im fed up with it. <br /> <br />4:B.O.B.D:cool song, always has been. <br /> <br />5.ARE WE THE WAITING:Not my sort of thing,my least fav. <br /> <br />6.ST.JIMMY:this is a cool fast paced song, makes up for previous song <br /> <br />7.GIVE ME NOVACAINE:This is a good song. but to summarise, the next three are disapointing. <br /> <br />11.W.M.U.W.S.E:Ah good the album pulls back to full strength with this song <br /> <br />12.HOMECOMING:Similar to jesus of suburbia but this is still a very good song <br /> <br />13.WHATSERNAME:Ends the album the album well. <br /> <br />So this album has its good points and its bad points.But overall a satisfactory album. <br />I would recommend Dookie.
B00005JO04|5.0|I went to see Syriana yesterday and I have to say that it was a riveting experience. I don't think any modern film presents the diverse facets of US foreign policy in the Middle East, the global energy crisis, the power plays in policy making by the special interests in DC and the complex nature of the war on terror as well as this movie does.  <br /> <br />Although the film is fiction and not meant to be political commentary per se, it leaves the moral judgments up to the viewer and does an astounding job of presenting the various factions in the storyline. I recommend Syriana very highly to anyone with an interest in international relations regardless of political ideology. <br /> <br />While I'm no movie buff (this is my first trip to the movie theater this year), I can say that I was literally dumbfounded by how powerful the film is in presenting a very complex and intricate subject matter in a completely fictional plot and how accurately it depicts the cultural and political perspectives of all the power players involved.  <br /> <br />As a side note Arab, Pakistani and Persian actors were used in the film so native languages are spoken in a large chunk of the movie (with English sub-titles) which provided a very authentic feel. The performances by George Clooney, Matt Damon and the rest of the cast were also excellent. I was lucky enough also to to catch part of an interview with Stephen Gaghan on Charlie Rose before seeing the movie.  <br />
B000B2YQX4|4.0|There is hope. As many reviews suggest, Playing the Angel is a difinitive turn back to DM's old self and a welcomed musical relief.  Much better than Exciter, but I still like Ultra just a little more. PTA is dark, but not their darkest; not darker than Black Celebration. And as much as the improvement is loved, PTA is still only half as good as Violator, MFTM, or SGR.<br /><br />I nearly set myself up for disappointment when I first heard \\"Precious\\" on the radio.  I liked it, but thought to myself 'This better be an average song and not the best one.' It turned out to be possibly the best song, but that's not a bad thing because it grew on me a great deal. It also reminds me of the classic, \\"Enjoy the Silence.\\"<br /><br />I gave PTA 4 stars because it is not quite thorough like the old days when you could listen straight through - over and over.  It's still very good, but I absolutely refuse to hear \\"John the Revelator\\" or \\"Macro\\" anymore beyond the 3 or 4 times I've heard them so far. Maybe I'm biased toward JTR's lyrics, but it is just musically awful as well. They played it at the concert and I could not believe how many people sang along. Forget the lyrics and listen to the music; it belongs on Exciter. \\"Macro\\" is not as bad, but musically it is also very coarse and drones a bit too much. I usually go for Gore's singing, but not on this one - also belonged on Exciter. I felt Gore redeemed himself on \\"Damaged People,\\" which sounded more like older Gore successes.<br /><br />As I said, \\"Precious\\" has slowly become my favorite, but the most surprising and rewarding aspect of PTA is Gahan's three inputs. I did not like his solo work and never suspected he could write this well, especially as he fit with the DM standards. \\"Suffer Well\\" (my 2nd favorite song on the CD) recalls songs like \\"Behind the Wheel\\" and \\"Question of Time.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sinner in Me\\" started out as my favorite, but slipped to 3rd or 4th over time. I love the lyrics and that dark rhythm is killer.  But anyone who has ever heard \\"I Against I\\" from the Blade II soundtrack would know that there is a serious ripoff here.  It's still unique for DM and one of the few newer styles they've incorporated that doesn't hurt their old sound.<br /><br />I recommend the CD, especially to DM fans who may have been waning. However, unlike those who keep saying this may be the best or darkest, I have to be honest and say it's not.  Some reviews absolutely love it. My summation is that I do not absolutely love it, but I definitely like it.d \\"I Against I\\" from the Blade II soundtrack would know that there is a serious ripoff here.

B000BJS4OY|5.0|Growing up in the 80's, I would constantly hear about how fantastic the \\"Boss\\" was, especially live.  I simply didn't get it.  That guy belching out \\"Born in the USA\\" with a raised fist or flexing his muscles while doing a Belinda Carslile-esque dance with a planted model just didn't seem that cool.  Even when classic rock radio revitalized some of his better, older material, it always sounded simply \\"good\\" to me, but not amazing.<br /><br />The other day I happened to catch the PBS broadcast of the Hammerismith Odeon show from 75.  I was absolutely blown away.  This band was so raw, so tight, so passionate.  Here, Bruce is not the bloated weight-lifter guy I remembered, but this scruffy, funky, wiry dude with a knit stocking cap.  His band is similarly young and hungry.  Even Little Steven, who later morphed into a caricature of himself with all the gypsy trappings, is completely cool and understated.  Well, he's got a pink pimp suit on, so maybe that's not understated, but he looks hip.<br /><br />Now I know why Bruce made the cover of Time in 74 or 75, why people traded his tapes a la the Dead, and why he had such a rabid following.  Anyone who saw this band live would have been a life-long convert.  Man, I wish I had been born earlier!<br /><br />I immediately bought the new box set containing the full show, and was not disappointed.  If you're just a casual Bruce fan, but a fan of music, this is sure to amaze and delight you.<br /><br />Perhaps the neatest moment is when they break into a vamp from \\"Shaft,\\" (I'm pretty sure it's Shaft, anyway) in the middle of, I think, Rosalita.<br /><br />If there is any more footage of Bruce pre-1980, let's hope it gets released!
0743454537|2.0|The topic of this book IS intriguing. It brings up a lot of important, thought-provoking conversations about medical ethics, the role of parents, the value of the individual, etc. However, Picoult is a second-rate writer who seems more concerned with turning out quantities of novels, rather than focusing on writing books of real quality. The cheesiness that results is worthy of a Lifetime original movie-of-the-week, in my opinion. The characters were lame, the coincidences laughable. I felt like this book was written by a sappy teenage girl. I think I would have enjoyed this book more if it were written by someone else. If you are looking for a quick read, devoid of literary \\"art\\", then this might be a book for you. If you are looking for something to inspire good conversation with friends, this is your book. If you are looking for something that will win you over with its figurative language, memorable characters and beautiful imagery... keep looking. You won't find any of that here.
B000BEZQ18|4.0|I felt like I was watching the film all over again listening to these songs especially the instrumental pieces. I love that feeling. The feeling of enormous love still strong through heartbreak. Forever eternal.                                     The film is magnificent ( Bravo! Heath & Jake, and I bow to Ang Lee ). And I love the music.
B0000009SM|5.0|Frank Zappa was arguably the most original composer of the modern-age.  No musician has anything on him.  All virtuosos and composers today only wish they have one-tenth the creativity and talent Frank Zappa did.  What I respect the most about Frank Zappa was that he dared to investigate the limits and boundaries of music more than anyone before him or since.  However, I never really thought of him as an expert in writing lyrics.  I thought he was a much better musician and composer than he was a song writer.   <br /> <br />      That being said, One Size Fits All is one of the best lyric albums Frank made in my opinion.  The album is great from start to finish.  I highly recommend ANY Frank Zappa album over 99% of music released since 2000 and definitely more so than music you hear on MTV or Top 40.
B00004T9UF|5.0|DO NOT BUY THIS RAPCRAP!! eminem is whiny and talentless. He makes fun of homosexauls, when he is really gay. He thinks that he is not, but as much as he talks about it he most likely is. He is very whiny. He complains that his life is so hard, when actaully he has all the cash he could ever want(which he doesn't deserve.)He could pay to get out of his \\"hard life\\". He said he group up on the streets of detroit, but he really group up in Nebraska and didn't move to Detroit until he was 18. He does have a bit of talent, but he obviously doesn't use it right. The only reason I gave this work of crap 2 stars is because the beats were good and he has a good voice. Do not get this for kids. It is very innapropriate and without a doubt will be a horrible influence. If u want this crap then burn it instead.
0800141660|5.0|I can't believe I would ever say this but Hugh Grant is perfect for the role of Edward Ferrars. Kate Winslet is annoying as should be, since Marianne is also the same. I can't get over the fact that Emma Thompson is too old to play Eleanor but she does a superb job so all is forgotten. And of course, I have a weak spot for Alan Rickman who plays Colonel Brandon. All in all, I loved it and will continue to re-watch it when I want to see some old world romance.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I didn't watch this for a long time because the description on the back of the case made it sound like \\"Danielle Steele does Jane Austen\\".  When I finally DID watch it, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it conformed to my ideas from reading the book.  The ending is a little different from the end of the novel, but actually incorporates an ending that Austen originally had written to the novel.  Overall, an excellent movie.
B000AP04FG|4.0|An Assassins' Marriage <br /> I highly recommend watching the movie Mr. & Mrs. Smith because people from various age groups would enjoy different aspects of the film and because there are a lot of suspenseful parts that everyone would find entertaining.  Furthermore, the overall theme of the movie is one that many people would find interesting. <br /> My experience with this film has always been enjoyable.  I have seen this film on various occasions, my first being when it appeared at a local theatre in town.  I also bought the film later when it first came out onto DVD. <br /> Ages from teenagers to adults would enjoy this film.  Teenagers mainly because it is a suspenseful story mixed with drama and comedy.  It is well done for young adults also because the strong emotion shown in the scenes is appropriate for their age as it makes the mind think.  Lastly, for the adults, there are a lot of marriage concepts and difficulties that occur that all mature adults can relate with. <br /> Suspense is a necessary extreme for many movies.  It allows people to become involved in the film and it definitely makes those confusing moments seem okay for you not to have total understanding.  Many people aren't faced with suspenseful situations like this on a daily basis, so when they are faced with them in movies, they seem to be somewhat uncomfortable to the audience.  When they solve the moments in the film, people feel as if they have become \\"one\\" with the film.  People enjoy suspense; it makes them feel as if they can't turn off the film.  They get hooked and connected to it because they don't know what could happen next.  Suspense is a big aspect of film that should be included on all movies in my opinion because it attracts the viewer. <br /> A theme is a movie is also a requirement that draws the viewers.  You can't have a movie that doesn't have a theme; it defeats the point of a film.  There has to be some reason for the movie to have been made.  The theme in this moviewould be easy for people to relate to since many people have been in love or thought of it.  Love and relationship are a very common theme in many movies. <br /> The film is a high quality movie that everyone should try and watch if they are into a good theme, suspense, some thrills, classical cinema, and a great love story.  <br />  <br /> <br />
B00005JNQA|3.0|Nicole Kidman is very good in her portrayal of the title role of an African born U.N. Interpreter who overhears a sinister assassination plot. Sean Penn's role of the Secret Service detective is subdued but portrayed well and supporting actors were excellent. The story is believable, the characters well developed and there are enough twists, turns and sufficient action to keep ones interest. However, I wasn't at all pleased with the ending and therein lies the reason for a 3 star rating. I'd have preferred a more emotional alternative. However, the characters were burdened from the start and given insufficient time to resurrect.
0783231032|2.0|Others have written about how unintentionally unfunny this picture is.  And I agree.  Even with character actors like Joe Flaherty, John Candy, Slim Pickens, and Ned Beatty, everything falls flat. But what really depressed me about the Collectors Edition DVD was the poor quality of both video and audio.  The DVD is NON-anamorphic, which would have kept me from purchasing it had I known. On top of that, there's this fuzzy, vaseline-on-the-lens effect to much of it, which I assume was the intent of the filmmakers and not a flaw of the DVD. But it's really pretty distracting now. And even though the DVD has a 5.1 audio track, the audio is distorted and clipped. <br /> <br />If you really want to own this movie, wait for (or look for) an anamorphic transfer that has an improved soundtrack.
B00005JNZJ|3.0|Overall, the movie fell just a hair below mediocre for me. The artistic elements are good including the costumes, sets, a few visual effects etc. The dialogue is SO SO SO weak. Great actors don't get to shine. Besides that, I don't think we'll be speaking that way in the 25th century. I can't speak for adaptation of the original animated feature, but it's obvious that this is an adaptation and not an original screenplay. There are lots of gaps in it although there's enough info to piece things together somewhat. Great fight scenes, it seems, but the camera angle was never wide enough to show what was actually happening. Of course this did create an interesting cinematic/visual effect. The best thing was the set design, some of the costumes, a few decent visual effects, theron's legs. If you are not already a fan of Aeon flux, wait for this to hit dvd. And then don't buy or rent the dvd. wait for someone else to get it and borrow it.
630382336X|4.0|As you can see from the comments, the Miramax edition is a very different restoration from the original MPI restoration and has generated some controversy among purists. The MPI vhs edition had a special virtue that needs to be considered: the stereo music track is richer and more enjoyable than either the Miramax or MPI dvd editions.  Some of us old enough to remember the original vinyl versus cd controversy discovered along the way that music on tape tends to be warmer than either vinyl or digital, and that seems clearly true to me about the stereo music track for this film.  As for the Miramax/MPI controversy about restorations, I'll say that the Miramax sound track plays back the concert hall scenes as though they're being heard from the audience, which seems logical enough from the viewpoint of the film's story but disappoints the music lover.  The alternate versions of the songs used in the Miramax version may have disappointed some of the purists, but 2 of the songs on the MPI track were inferior versions (John's voice cracking) so take your pick.  The Miramax reconstruction is a not a terrible version, just another version.  It won't be seen as the definitive reconstruction, but it is easier to take than the MPI versions on account of the smoother dialogue track.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|One of the coolest sounds i have ever heard. This is a new sound and is really cool. I strongly suggest that you pick this album up. The lack of Head (the guitarist) does not hurt their sound at all. So if you are looking for the coolest sound get this or the New System of a Down CD Hypnotize.<br /><br />-Mike [The Korn Street Team]
B000B8QEZG|2.0|Great riff from ABBA. But Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! is much better than this fake. <br />I think this is only shadow of Madonna from 80's and 90's.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|koRn is back and better then ever. This is there 7th studio album and the first cd with out Head, I had faith that Munky would pull it off with out Head and he really did. He sounds aswome and my fav. songs are, man I can't pick I like the whole cd. The art work is out of this world.
B000001E7L|5.0|The Cranberries were surprise superstars when they released their debut and they cemented their success with their sophomore album No Need To Argue. This album is a mish-mash of emotions and styles, the whole album has Dolores O'Riordan's signature Irish vocals but the songs aren't folky and highland-ish. Rock is the main agenda. I was pretty surprised with the quality of this album, it is phenomenal. You could say at the moment I am expanding my tastes!! The Cranberries are truly original unlike U2 who sound so commercial and American it defies belief, The Cranberries are more true to their roots and incorporate their Irish flair within their songs.<br /><br />No Need To Argue flows well and isn't interuppted with any filler tracks or interludes. All the songs keep the album coheisive. The vocals of O'Riordan are really a feature of this album, they swoop and sway softly along with the music, her alto tone is special. Now, let's not forget the others, the rest of The Cranberries.<br /><br />Noel Hogan, Mike Hogan and Feargal Lawler are superb additions to this band, however like Evanescence the female lead singer is the most well known of the group. I can see why this music connects with such a wide audience. Their music is firstly original, never copying anyone else and secondly it's lyrics and subject matters are things people can relate with.<br /><br />The first track on this album is Ode To My Family, this track sounds really Irish with the phrasing and pronounciation. The 'do do do do's' are quite effective as well. The theme is about loving your family and memories of childhood. I Can't Be With You is a sophisticated rock track, no screaming and grungy guitars just upper-class rock. Twenty One is the first dark track on the album, very gloomy indeed. I like this track for two reasons. One, because 21 is my favourite number and secondly the stark honesty of the song is riveting.<br /><br />If I had to pick a favourite song from this album Zombie would be it. Zombie is a gorgeous track, even if it's mood is serious and angry. This song is one of their most successfull songs and has memorable themes, lyrics and a catchy guitar riff that is chilling to the bone. Empty is on the other hand the complete opposite to Zombie, it starts with a bright piano riff that almost sounds like a celesta. Very cunning. Everything I Said starts off in the same vein as The Cranberries' like to start in, haunting yet simplistic. This track is just that and O'Riordan's voice is ghostly.<br /><br />The Icicle Melts is an extremely up-beat and vibrant song. It's lyrics question alot, the chorus is great and overall the arrangement is super. Disappointment is again sombre yet classy, I wonder why Dolores' voice is so strong on every track? This is just as consistent as any other track on the album. Ridiculous Thoughts starts with an electric and acoustic guitar harmonising and a voice swimming between. This song sounds like the closest thing you'll ever get to Irish country-western music.<br /><br />Dreaming My Dreams is a nice ballad dedicated to Dolores' lover. Really sweet. Next, comes a short track by the name of Yeat's Grave. Yeat's Grave is experimental and has a good hook, this is the track where the band seems to gel the best. A definite favourite. Daffodil Lament is static like to start off with and is a really long track, it sounds like Disappointment. No Need To Argue is the last track, isn't it? No, there is a hidden track but we will get to that later. It is another ballad where Dolores features heavily. The hidden track comes up on i-tunes as being called \\"Data\\", I'm not sure what it is called but I like it.<br /><br />Overall, this album is classy and simply stunning. It is written I think for simple Irish people, which is what this band does well. Instead of trying to please the upper-class Americans like U2 do, The Cranberries are reaching out further and spreading their musical message to the common folk of Ireland. I really love this album and I think it deserves a place in any record collection.cord collection.
B0009WFFS6|2.0|It's really sad to see these guys just going through the motions. Nothing in this DVD set or the associated CD set even comes close to the old Cream recordings from the '60's. The most glaring and obvious example of this is \\"Crossroads\\". Compared to the classic \\"Wheels of Fire\\" version, this new recording is yawn inspiring. Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce seem to have a hard time getting interested. All of the intricate interplay between guitar and bass on the earlier recording are just a memory. I guess that either Jack Bruce or Ginger Baker or both of them were running short on cash. If you want the real thing, skip this depressing effort and find a copy of \\"Wheels of Fire\\".
B0002Z0EYA|3.0|I rented this movie on the advice of gay male friends, who highly recommended it.  Now I know why.  Don't rent this movie for the  acting, the plot, the story or really any other production value.  Rent it for Brad Pitt.  Even if you aren't a Brad Pitt fan - rent it.  You may convert. <br /> <br />A perfect destruction of the Iliad - almost glorious for that reason.  But otherwise a dud.  Turn the sound off and enjoy the eye candy in this one.
B000AYQLX6|4.0|Forget what you've heard -- from the opening bars of \\"Going Down on Love,\\" you can tell this is a new, and vastly improved listening experience.  Sure, Yoko's tinkering with the album cover and her creepy addition of her name whispered during John's fervent love song to May Pang is a bit much, but all is forgiven when you actually hear how great this re-release sounds.  When Walls and Bridges was originally released, most criticism focused on how impersonal and produced it sounds -- I must confess it's hard to see that now.  Each song strikes me as very personal, from \\"Scared\\" to \\"Number 9 Dream\\" to \\"Nobody Love You.\\"  John is clearly writing about his own experiences, from his sorrow to transitive sexual joy to his attempts to drown out both, to his still-strong bond with Yoko.<br /><br />The \\"impersonal\\" production knock is also overstated -- yes, the horns and strings are a bit busy at times, but they work.  Would you like a stripped-down \\"Number 9 Dream\\"?  In some ways the careful and lavish production reminds me at times of Gene Clark's No Other, which was similarly drenched with Thomas Jefferson Kaye's mystical and drug-induced production overload.  It's a different look at these artists, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  Kudos to Yoko and whoever re-engineered this remaster -- it's one of the finest remastering jobs I have heard, up there with Rhino's 1995 remastering of the Yes catalogue.  Thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish (and that includes Elton John's off-key harmonizing on the bonus tracks....).
0784011176|5.0|I have seen this film many times, and love it more with each viewing. I have a question, though, for those of you who have seen it on DVD: does the DVD include alternet endings? I am looking for the extended under-water scene at the end which seems to have been cut from the American VHS release.
B00079ZACM|5.0|Somew movies just have 'values' and the original The Four Feathers is one of them.<br /><br />FEATHERS is set in England and the Sudan about ten years after the Mahdi killed General Gordon.  In fact, seeing Charlton Heston in Khartoum would be a good lead-in to 4 FEATHERS.The plot revolves around four friends, all young officers in the same regiment and all heirs to an aristocratic military tradition heavy on the memory of the Crimean War (see the original \\"Charge of the Light Brigade\\" film).<br /><br />Three men boldly go to the Sudan with General Kitchener's expedition.  One chickens out and resigns his commission, losing the woman he loves in the process.  To redeem himself, he goes to the Sudan on his own and must help his former comrades.<br /><br />The story is well-explained, well-paced and has great values of timing, editing, and direction.  The technicolor and the score are both excellent.  4 FEATHERS is a cut above other British productions of the period in terms of technical quality!<br /><br />FEATHERS also exemplifies the best values of the Victorian UK upper class-- belief in country, honor, loyalty, heroism, and sacrifice.<br /><br />The remake is a pathetic immitation of this original, which did not need a remake, now or ever!  A must-see and a great addition to any DVD collection.
B0006FO9J2|5.0|Just to clear something up, people are saying you can get it cheaper... Sure but this is not the US version if you read the details close it says: <br /> <br /># Format: Import, Ntsc <br /># Studio: EMI Int'l <br /># DVD Release Date: December 28, 2004 <br /> <br />The format is NTSC which will work in the US but ut is an Import.

B000BYY0RY|5.0|To her Aussie fans, Kylie is an adored princess. From the soap opera \\"Neighbours\\", through the PWL and indie phases and on to global success she has quinteseesentially remained the Aussie girl next door. Part of the joy of this DVD is watching just how much Kylie gets off on her audience. It is one of the most recipricol relationships I have ever witnessed in popular music. This is the concert tour where she had to cancel the Aussie leg of the tour as she found out she had breast cancer whilst she was at home in Melbourne. The DVD will not spoil the shows when she finally makes it home to Oz to perform the Showgirl tour next year-it merely makes us salivate for the real thing. <br /> <br />From the opening number of her classic \\"Better the Devil You Know\\" through to the encores of \\"Especially For You\\" and \\"Love at First Sight\\" you get almost two hours of pure unadulterated pop perfection. Every song is celebrated with joy and every fan is catered for - whether you have adored her since \\"The Locomotion\\" or from her more recent \\"I Believe In You\\". Her singing is at its peak, the stage settings are superb and her band and dancers almost steal attention away from Ms Minogue. <br /> <br />From all of your Aussie fans Kylie, we wish you well and can reassure you that when you do make it back home late next year you will be feted as the Pop Queen you truly are. <br /> <br />
074322454X|5.0|For non-fiction, this was an amazing page turner.  I read this book before watching the movie/mini-series.  Great history about great heroes.  Ambrose does an excellent job as an historical storyteller.  I couldn't put it down.  This is a must read for anyone wanting to learn about the physical and mental struggles that these heroes went through.  I can't express in words the feelings I have about these ordinary people who sacrificed their lives and became heroes in my eyes.  I know that this is just a story of one company but I am sure that there were many ordinary heroes of WWII who have not received the recognition they deserved. <br /> <br />I can't compare the book to the movie series because they were both excellent beyond comprehension.  This book should be required reading for all Americans.
B000001GPX|5.0|Already there are 117 reviews of this release on amazon, and most of them give five stars, as does mine.  I think that I'm justified in writing though, because I feel that there hasn't been enough balance in the discussion here.  Unquestionably, this is a great recording.  The performance is on fire from the first notes, and is continualy alive until the very end.  The score is rendered very clearly and intelligently, thanks to Kleiber, the Wiener Philharmoniker, and DG's engineers, who gave the instruments a finely resolved, albeit unnatural, sound.  All of these qualities put these recordings head and shoulders above most of the competition, BUT they do not make a definitive recording as many have said here, since such a thing cannot exist.  If your standards are the qualities I've talked about, this is the recording for you, but for instance I have different priorities.  My aesthetics are based on the idea that art is an abstraction of nature, so what I prize above all is a completely natural, organic reading, that is, evolving inevitably from start to finish, where every moment is both determined by what has come before, and determines everything to follow.  I  feel that, especially in these works, Furtwangler is the highest exponent of this ideal, and indeed his performances of them are uniquely powerful spiritual experiences (for instance, the 1954 recording with the Berliners of the fifth, and the wartime recording of the seventh).  But this is only one perspective; there are many other ways of evaluating the quality of recordings, and all of them will come up with different performances that are \\"ideal\\".  So in short, I think a little objectivity is called for in reviewing these.  They certainly are powerful, intelligent, and sincere performances, but contrary to what Mr. Hurwitz says, they certainly aren't \\"quintessential\\".
B000BM6AVA|5.0|It took me a a few spins to grasp this album, but I'm completely hooked. It is my heroin for sure. Mesmerize grabbed me instantly, probably due to more \\"catchy hooks\\" throughout the recording. But, this one is a total showing of their musicianship and technical prowess.  <br />I've read many a review down playing Darron's ability to carry vocals. I believe these people don't like change to conformity. They want their usual radio friendly, run of the mill formula from any band. Darron's vocals add a tremendous change that was definitely needed in metal. No more one singer and that's it. No more one singer and only his/her interpretation of the songs. Darron adds an emotion that highlights the underlying insanity of the songsand their message.  I love SOAD's ability to be different. There are plenty of run of the mill bands out there to listen to. This is something you will definitely have to have an artist's ear to appreciate. It's DIFFERENT. Not RADIO BULLSH*T!  <br />If you are a fan of Green Day, Disturbed, Foo Fighters, etc. (aka, radio bullsh*t) please do all SOAD fans a favor and don't  buy this album just so you can  desecrate it with your lack of musical and artistic appreciation. What makes \\"true\\" art is individualism. Not \\"run of the mill\\" formulas. SOAD is there own thing. 'nuff said.
B000001EAQ|4.0|That's the declaration U2 made in this experimental studio album.  While many critics were disappointed by the results of U2's so-called \\"dance\\" album, I found it to be one of their best.  The techno and electronic beats serve to enhance many of the songs on this album and only take away from a few.  Many of the songs translated well when they were played live during the band's mega Popmart tour.  It continues U2's 90s trend of having more fun and stripping away the seriousness of the U2 of the 80s.  That's not to say that none of the songs have a serious tune.  Some of them are but for the most part, U2's Pop is just a fun album that shows another experimental side of U2. <br /> <br />Discotheque: This song serves as a good introduction to U2's new sound and image.  The song starts off with a nice buildup before kicking into a downright nasty guitar riff.  The lyrics make no sense (\\"You know you're chewing bubble gum.  You know what it is but you still want some.  You just can't get enough of that lovie dovie stuff.\\") But that's a part of the fun.  The rhythm section really holds the song together and the boom-chas at the end are hilarious.  They're a great way to end the song and a great way to start the album. 10/10 <br /> <br />Do You Feel Loved?: The most danceable track on the entire record.  Very seductive lyrics but it's a fairly average song that doesn't translate to the stage well.  Nothing sticks out when I hear this song.  7/10 <br /> <br />Mofo: THE BEST SONG ON THIS ALBUM!  A very fast-paced and energetic song that is mind-blowing when played live.  The song starts off with a rapid and funky bass when all of a sudden; Edge's guitar kicks in.  He makes it sound like an airplane turbine, something I've never heard come out of a guitar.  A must hear for any U2 fans.  12/10 <br /> <br />If God Will Send His Angels: This song is pretty good except for its poor placement right after Mofo.  Its very slow pace kills the momentum of the first three songs.  It also contains airplane sounds but they sound digitally added, not coming from an instrument.  The use of techno sound takes away from this track.  It would sound good done acoustically without the electronic noise.  Still, this track does contain pretty good lyrics.  7/10 <br /> <br />Staring at the Sun: Staring at the Sun is similar to God Will Send... but much better.  The guitar is much more noticeable and the song conveys a calmness that will relax the listener, not bore them.  It has much better lyrics than IGWSHA that show off Bono's talent as a songwriter.  All in all, I'd say this song is a good pop friendly ballad.  9/10 <br /> <br />Last Night on Earth: The most rock-sounding track on Pop.  I love the way Bono's and Edge's voices continually rise during the chorus.  There's very little techno in the song, which works for it.  Last Night is a good rock song but not extraordinary.  8/10 <br /> <br />Gone: Just an amazing rock track.  Edge's guitar is incredible.  The lyric are wonderful and Bono's voice sounds very good during this song.  It's a song that I can relate to and I think many others will relate to it too.  This is one of my favorite songs from this album.  10/10 <br /> <br />Miami: This is the first of three tracks that go downhill for me.  Miami is a song that you'll either love or hate.  I personally hate it because of the large amount of sound distortion.  The lyrics make absolutely no sense and Bono seems to talk his way through this song instead of singing.  Edge's \\"pa pa pa's\\" get annoying within two minutes.  This track could have been a lot better than it was.  6/10 <br /> <br />The Playboy Mansion: In my opinion, this is the worst song on the album.  It takes everything that was wrong with Miami and makes it worse.  The lyrics are awful.  So is Bono's singing.  I understand that they were trying to have fun but boring is not fun.  It's the only track from Pop that was never played live. Good.  5/10 <br /> <br />If You Wear That Velvet Dress: This tracks better than the last two but it still doesn't do anything for me.  It has less distortion and I can probably learn to like it but right now, I don't.  The lyrics are very seductive and Edge's guitar is pretty good but it's too long and dull for me.  6.5/10 <br /> <br />Please: Please is a very beautiful, political song asking for peace in Ireland.  I feel that it's an update of Sunday Bloody Sunday.  The lyrics are hauntingly beautiful and Bono's voice is extraordinary.  You can hear the passion he puts into this song.  It's definitely one of the best songs on the album.  10/10 <br /> <br />Wake Up, Dead Man: This closing track has very dark lyrics and has a nice build-up from just a guitar to the whole band.  Bono's voice sounds good but the sound distortion takes away from his performance.  But even with the distortion, it's still a very good way to close the album.  8/10 <br /> <br />While Pop may not be perfect, it's still a very good album and is one of my top five U2 albums.  I'm glad I bought this album and I think it deserves better than what the critics gave it.   <br />
B000AP04L0|5.0|I was excited when I heard about a new special edition of this movie, but disappointed recieved it. This movie is great, but why are they calling this a special edition? There's hardly anything special about it. The deleted scenes are great, but I want more! And let's see a documentary about Milton! And a commentary track! Finally why is this thing in 2.0 stereo? Couldn't they have given the sound a better transfer? The movie desearves better!
630542828X|5.0|One more film about lawyers but a useful one. One more film on pollution but a necessary one. Yes lawyers may believe in what they are doing : fighting for justice, even if justice does not exist really, just, at best, some damages for some damage, one tooth for one mouthful of teeth lost by the fault of someone else. No hope to recuperate your eyes, not even one, when you have been blinded by the corporate delinquent that lives on the other side of the road. No hope and yet some lawyer maybe might be on the track and might catch that delinguent corporate criminal and get some damages for the damage he caused. But there is such a narrow chance it may work, you may prefer to, you might have rather stop the whole machine and cry in your corner, try to forget the damage for which no damages will be enough. This film is so pessimistic that the last page of it does not erase the feeling that there is no hope on this planet, and that we can only hope to die fast and in not too much suffering.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne
0060934913|5.0|I couldn't believe how intrigued I was just by the first sentances. I haven't had a book capture my interest like this since Catcher in the Rye (and that was highschool). I am in the industry and it is really nice to hear somone telling it how it really is, and how it is not just a \\"Martha Stewart / Emeril\\" world of culinary people - we have to work hard for everything that we do. I truly applaud Chef Bourdain it would be an honor just to work by him. Thank you for writing this book for me and everyone out there wearing the checks.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Madonna is worthy to be placed in the pantheon of all time great artists of the 20th century.  Always shrouded in intrigue and controversy, Madonna was the material girl that many idolized and many others detested.  She has had the longevity of Prince and other musicians of her ilk and she has become a staple and immediately recognizable icon in pop music.  A worldly phenomenon in her own right, Madonna has tackled every area of entertainment from acting, dancing, authoring and yeees, singing.  I've always admired Madonna for her ability to sport a different look each time she comes out...she's gone from wearing camosols and lace to the Marilyn Monroe-starlet look to the dominatrix and everything else in between.  On \\"Confessions of a Dance Floor\\", Madonna gives you tons of high-energy electro-beats that get you ready for the dance clubs.  Gone away are her attempts at being a pop artist (there's really not a slow cut on Confessions...), but instead, Madonna becomes the electronica-diva she should have always been from the beginning of her career.  Her vocals are still a bit stoic and mechanical and she fails to show much range, but who really cares.  At this point in her career, Madonna doesn't have to give you stellar vocals--just good ole fashion music that will liberate you and make you feel good inside.  Of course, this is still familiar territory, and  sonically this isn't cutting edge material--probably because Madonna is pushing 50 and has become a mama and a Mrs.--but for all intents and purposes \\"Confessions of a Dance Floor\\" does an excellent job of getting the party started right! Madonna has indeed done it all and it's good to see that marriage and motherhood hasn't slowed her down a bit.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|the new korn- see you on the other side album in my humble oppinion is the best yet. the 14 track cd contains a strange but satisfying mix of disturbing lyrics, curse words, and heavy sound. The lead guitarist Brian \\"Head\\" Welch has left the band to pursue god, leaving James \\"Munky\\" Shafer to explore his musical limits. The new CD has the same old rock with a new spin. My personal favorite song on the album is the song \\"Throw Me Away\\" track 6 on the cd. The cd begins with the funky rock hit \\"Twisted Transistor\\" and ends with the emotional masterpeace \\"Tearjerker\\". I give this CD 5 Stars.
B000B8QF14|5.0|This CD/DVD is absolutely amazing.  I am a fan of Green Day's old stuff and its new stuff.  This CD/DVD ties it all together every performance on this album is great: <br />1. American Idiot 3.5/5 Great opener! <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia 5/5 Perfect rendition of the 9 minute song.  Each minute is better than the last. <br />3. Holiday 4/5 This is a song that is much better live than the slbum version <br />4. Are We The Waiting 4/5 Great American idiot Song <br />5. St. Jimmy 4/5 See Are We The Waiting <br />6. Longview 4.5/5 Awesome! <br />7. Hitchin' A Ride 4/5 Goes together with Brain Stew well. <br />8. Brain Stew 4/5 Goes together with Hitchin' A Ride well. <br />9. Basket Case 3/5 Not as good as rest of CD/DVD <br />10. King For A Day/Shout 5/5  Need to see the DVD for a great performance. <br />11. Wake Me Up When September Ends 5/5 Best performance on the CD/DVD.  I get choked up every time I listen to this song. <br />12. Minority 4.5/5 (5/5 on DVD) Performance is better on DVD.  The CD is missing the guitar and harmonica solos that the DVD has. <br />13. Boulevard of Broken Dreams 4/5 Great song. <br />14. Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life) 4.5/5 Great closer, but I wanted a better closer, something a bit heavier. <br /> <br />The DVD 5/5  Has parts of the concert the CD does not have.  It is also cool to see what goes into a Green Day Concert.  Great  sound and picture qualtiy. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a must own CD/DVD for any Green Day or punk rock fan.  Green Day continues to change punk history, and their first live CD/DVD truly shows this.  This is the only album I have  been listening to for the last couple of weeks.  When you listen to it, you will be hooked!
B000BMSTMS|1.0|I'm quite speechless actually...but I feel like I have to post this. This album is trash. It's very unfortunate that Korn had the balls to release an album of this caliber, but hey whatever pays the bills...right? I'm looking forward to the Avril Lavigne Hanson and Korn tour...such a sad day for music.
B00023BLXK|3.0|When \\"Dirty Dancing\\" became a huge sleeper smash in the summer of 1987 with the soundtrack still selling strong through the end of 1988, there was talk about a sequel and of course in addition to the \\"Dirty Dancing Live\\" tour and short-lived TV show, the phenomenon kind of died out. Thus, I was surprised to hear about \\"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\\" in 2004. Why did they wait so long? And is it a sequel, a prequel, a re-interpretation, or a whole movie on its own? Honestly, I think it did itself a disservice by having \\"Dirty Dancing\\" in the title. They were obviously trying to capitalize on the classic film, but the time to do that was closer to 1987, not 17 years later! <br /> <br />This movie takes place in 1958, on the eve of Cuba's revolution, and opens similarly to \\"Dirty Dancing\\". The protagonist is a girl on the cusp of adulthood, riding in the back of the car and musing on her interests in life. In the original, Baby was an idealistic daddy's girl who dreamed of joining the Peace Corps in Kennedy's optimistic age of 1963. The years are significant, because Patrick Swayze has an extended cameo sequence as a dance instructor. Is he Johnny or not from the original movie? Hard to say, as the credits at the end of the film don't name him as that character, and in this film he looks a lot older (obviously), yet he's supposed to be five years younger than when he was in the original. Confusing? <br /> <br />Well, taken as a completely separate film, it is entertaining with GREAT music. But purist for the Cuban music of the 1950s won't like it either, as it is definitely music blended from the traditions of Cuban style with the modern hip-hop rhythms that satisfy our feet. I love the music enough to buy the soundtrack, but as for watching the film over and over...I just didn't felt drawn in like the way \\"Dirty Dancing\\" did all those summers ago. That film had heart and was a surprise, under the radar discovery. This one, though based on the choreographer's life, seems to be attempting to cash in on the other's success, but it fails. Its proof that the magic some films have aren't easily transferrable to another. All the magical ingredients/elements have to be right, and this one simply fails to live up to the other. The smartest thing the producers could have done to promote the film was not use \\"Dirty Dancing\\" in the title. It might have done better in theaters. But then again, a film with a backdrop of the Cuban Revolution is a tough sell to American audiences anyway. <br /> <br />So, skip the film and buy the soundtrack. That's one thing you can play over and over without getting tired of.
0385513755|4.0|I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this novel. Reviews of it seem to range from \\"this is the finest novel ever written\\" to heated condemnation. In my opinion, this book deserves neither extreme. I've certainly read better novels, and there's nothing here worthy of the scorn heaped upon it either. It is, quite simply, a thriller with some art history and legend thrown into the mix. Taken as such, I found it an enjoyable read, though probably not a book I will give a second reading.<br /><br />I do find the controversy surrounding this book fascinating. This is the first novel, in my memory, to give rise to a virtual cottage industry for the purpose of 'debunking' it. Most \\"historical novels\\" have fairly dubious claims to historicity, yet few feel compelled to write and talk endlessly about how wrong they were, or conversely, to defend an alternative history. My hope is that this novel might spur people to read more history and to ask more questions, and to do so with the aid of something other than the shrill spinoffs from this novel. Irrespective of the conclusions drawn, such an exercise would be intellectually healthy. Unfortunately, most will consider themselves quite well read on the subject either by reading this book or some polemic spawned by it, a few might actually read both, and almost none will read anything actually scholarly. Then of course we have those who will wait for the movie version rather than read anything. Oh, this is getting depressing...<br /><br />OK. Summation: The DVC is fun as mind candy. Don't take it so damn seriously. If the topics interest you, go read something a historian has written about them.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It is well-made, engaging, humorous, smart, and it has a lot of heart.  Even though it is quite long, I always am just itching to put on the second disk at the end of the first, who cares how late it is!  As I understand it, this is one of the most popular movies ever released in DVD format - and it sure deserves to be! <br />
B000A5044C|4.0|I think I couldn't move for a while after finishing this film. It really hit me that hard. This movie is beautifully filmed. It starts out slow but somehow manages to hold your interest in a quiet way as it silently unloads its full emotion all the way to the heartstopping end. This is not the kind of movie that blows things up in your face and hands things to you straight off the platter. It's more the exact opposite of that. The plot is simple. The actors carry the film. And they carry it well. The shots are still, but moving in their own way. The soundtrack is spare. This movie is neither oversimplistic nor overly emotional as it deals with an immensely difficult topic. I watch a lot of films and it's been a long time since any film has had such an effect on me.  I give it four stars because it was absolutely worth watching once but not something I could handle watching again. Not for a while, anyway.
B00005JNJV|4.0|this movie  shows the untold story of what happened between bruce wayne being a small kid and when he was batman.the fighting was pretty good.well bruce is not some big time millionairre hes a prisoner like in tibet or somewhere.then he trains as a ninja.he learns from ra za ghul.raz is played by qui gon jinn.then he goes like crocodile dundee and goes to the concrete jungle like countless others to america to fight crime.                        in america he battles scarecrow..hes quite a bit more brutal than the tim burton batmen,which is really cool.morgan freeman plays this guy who makes batmans toys.commissioner gordan is still quite a bit younger than normal. .the best thing about it by far is the tank like batmobile!now that fn rocked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! he had an ol lady,but she was crabby the whole time so who cares?i have every batman movie made  and they ARE ALL  not as cool as this one[written before dark knight]......i say if you've watched the other 6 batman movies then watch this one too.
B000ASATYO|4.0|In 1995, Peter Jackson was a New Zealand-born filmmaker who was known only to cult movie fans for a series of low-budget gorefests which were so remarkable they established his standing as a very talented, if somewhat sick and twisted, director. With such films as Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles and the legendary Dead Alive (aka Braindead) to his credit, Jackson established himself as a macabre genius with a vivid imagination and a keen eye for visual details. With Heavenly Creatures in 1994, he showed that he was capable of much more than just blood, gore and sick humor. He could actually tell real stories of human drama in a powerful way. That wouldn't have been so surprising had his previous film not featured a man being killed by a walking pile of severed intestines. No one had any idea at this point that this guy from New Zealand would go on to make three of the greatest films of all time.  <br /> <br />In 1995, Peter Jackson made a return to comedy-horror with The Frighteners. While it's much less extreme than the likes of Dead Alive, The Frighteners is a wonderful mix of horror and humor and remains a very impressive directorial effort. Michael J. Fox stars as a psychic con man who gets his ghost pals to terrorize someone house so that he can offer his services to get rid of them. Also appearing are Trini Alvarado, Chi McBride, John Astin, Dee Wallace-Stone, Jake Busey, and R. Lee Ermey. One of the highlights of the movie is Re-Animator star Jeffrey Combs' hilarious performance as a weirdo FBI Agent.  <br /> <br />The Frighteners' plot, concocted by Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh,  is not exactly groundbreaking but it certainly does the job. This movie marked (I think) Peter Jackson's first use of digital special effects. The movie is filled with special effects from start to finish. His effects company, WETA, got their feet wet here experimenting with many techniques that would be put to use on Jackson's next project, The Lord of the Rings. Seeing The Frightenersafter the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you can plainly see Jackson's genius at work. Even though the material is certainly not of the same magnitude, Jackson's visual prowess and strong imagination are very visible. His camera movements are always interesting, such as his fondness for steadicam and handheld shots. His frequent use of wide-angle lenses helps to lend a kind of surreal, wacky feel to some scenes. And of course, there's plenty of goofy humor as you would expect. There's a pretty memorable scene involving Judge (John Astin) and a mummy in a museum. Any scene involving Jeffrey Combs is hysterical.  <br /> <br />The Frighteners is a highly-enjoyable movie that fans of Peter Jackson must see. The movie, not too surprisingly, did not find its audience in theaters, but developed a devout cult following on video. Cult fans are really the best audience for this movie. It's a bit too offbeat for mainstream audiences. You can see from this movie that there is a very talented and imaginative director at the helm, one who is capable of great things. Indeed Jackson went on to make The Lord of the Rings trilogy after this, so obviously he is capable of great things. The Frighteners is less concerned with characters and story, it's more about humor and special effects, so no one is likely to proclaim it a masterpiece. But it's certainly a great time, for those who enjoy this type of thing.  <br /> <br />This new DVD edition, Peter Jackson's Director's Cut, is basically the 1998 laserdisc on DVD. It features Jackson's first feature commentary track, plus the legendary 4-hour documentary The Making of The Frighteners, which was produced by PJ himself. The Director's Cut is a longer cut of the movie, extended by about 13 minutes. I can't say if its superior to the theatrical cut, but it just fleshes things out a bit more and adds a bit more characterization. The 16:9 widescreen transfer is very good.  It looks like new movie, not one that's ten years old. This is a great DVD edition of a very good movie, one that fans are sure to love. Highly recommended for cult fans or anyone interested in Peter Jackson's development as a filmmaker.
0553801503|5.0|I'm a huge fan of A Song of Ice and Fire and after I read A Feast For Crows for the first time I felt a little disappointed. The first three books of this series are nearly perfect; every chapter advances the plot and/or develops the characters. There are absolutely breathtaking and unforgettable scenes, such as the Ned's execution, the birth of the dragons, the Battle of the Blackwater Rush, the Red Wedding, the fight between Oberyn Martell and Gregor Clegane, Tywin Lannister's murder. <br /> <br />In a Feast for Crows, there are a few chapters of impact too (the kingsmoot, the conversation between Doran Martell and Arianne), but they involve secondary characters and plot lines. There are lots and lots of Brienne chapters that I still don't know what they are for, because nothing of importance happens. There are too many new POV characters and Jon, Dany, and Tyrion are left out. I highlighted all of these shortcomings in a previous review. <br /> <br />A few months later, I decided to read this book again and enjoyed it about a hundred times more. I already knew what to expect from Brienne's chapters and could enjoy the good bits, for instance, what a nice fellow Septon Meribald is. Jaime's chapters were so good at character development and I somehow failed to notice this on my first read. Qyburn is so creepy, what has he done to Gregor Clegane? How can Cersei be so stupid, paranoid, and cruel? A Feast For Crows shouldn't be compared to A Storm of Swords, because the latter closes a lot of plot lines, while the former is preparing for what is to come. There is an ominous atmosphere involving Dany's invasion; we know there is a threat at the other side of the ocean and something huge is about to happen but we don't know what it is, because we don't have Dany's POV. Instead we only get a few bits of information, which are scattered all over the place, and it's scary. Jaime observes as snow falls for the first time in years in the riverlands, but we don't hear anything about the Others. Feast is not a book like Storm of Swords, but it can be extremely enjoyable if the reader is able to change his or her expectations. Martin was going to skip five years, but later decided the gap wouldn't work. We don't know what his reasons are, and maybe this book could have been better. Reading action-packed Storm of Swords is more fun than reading slow Feast for Crows, but I know it deserves more than three stars.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I loved this movie. It is well worth buying and watching over and over again. The Polar Express you could watch 10 times<br /><br />and still love it. I think it was a very beautiful movie.<br /><br />I ordered this movie off of amazon as soon<br /><br />as I watched it. When I got this dvd in the mail I went over<br /><br />to my parent's house and dad watched it with me.<br /><br />Mom was working but I wish she could have watched it with us.<br /><br />Dad is the type of person once he sees a movie that is it<br /><br />but I enjoyed seeing dad's face when he watched this movie.<br /><br />I will never forget it.

It is the<br /><br />best movie around.<br /><br />Buy it!
B000002KKK|2.0|I am a huge ZZ Top fan and have nothing strongly against this album. It's just that there are too many okay-but-not-great songs on this album, and I just don't appreciate their blues as much as their rock.    I Thank You--I like the tune of this song, but it can get tiring after a couple listenings pretty easily. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons.    She Loves My Automobile--In this song, Dusty Hill really shows his vocal scales, from the very highest he can go to the absoloute lowest. This song features jazzy blues and is one of the previously described okay-but-not-great songs on the album. Featuring vocals by Dusty Hill.    I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide--This song is definately too long for its quality. I thought it was not a bad song at first, but I was wrong. The words, \\"I'm Baaaad, I'm Nationwiiiide,\\" stick in my head for quite a while and interrupt me whenever I'm thinking about a song of much better quality. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons.    A Fool For Your Stockings--Another song too long for its quality. This one doesn't have the same annoying tune, but it does have the same type of singing as the last one combined with blues, which don't make a good combination. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons.    Manic Mechanic--Songs sung by Frank Beard are always interesting, with his almost unnaturally deep voice. But this one beats them all because his voice is amplified to make it sound robotic. So when there's not blues, it's so loud that you can't hear the music over it. And when it is blues, you're left waiting for the next time he sings to come. So overall, it's an interesting song (even if they never do say the words \\"manic mechanic throughout the whole thing). Featuring vocals by Frank Beard.    Dust My Broom--I haven't listened to this song much, but last time I did, it didn't leave me a good enough impression of it to want to listen to it continuously. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons.    Lowdown In The Street--The best song on the album. This song gets closer to rock than any other song on the album. The tune is very good and the singing is too. It's always a good sign when you find songs sung by Dusty Hill on your ZZ Top albums. Featuring vocals by Dusty Hill and Billy Gibbons.    Hi Fi Mama--Another song featuring the highest of Dusty Hill's voice. Very similar to SHE LOVES MY AUTOMOBILE, this song also features jazzy blues including saxaphones and also proves to be okay but not great. Featuring vocals by Dusty Hill.    Cheap Sunglasses--This song is as long as I'M BAD, I'M NATIONWIDE, but at least it lives up to its length with its quality a bit more than that song. It's not great, but it still has some good qualities in it. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons.    Esther Be The One--The second-to-best song on the album. It's more slow rock than blues, and I'm quite fond of the tune and the singing, plus the guitar playing that is repeated after the chorus every time it's sung. Featuring vocals by Billy Gibbons and Dusty Hill.    So my final say is **1/2 out of *****. (I would put that at the top, but you can't do halfs in the actual starring.)
B00005JOFO|5.0|a simple story delivered with incredible emotion and conviction... stunning cinematography and remarkable performances...
B000003AEB|5.0|This album is one of the first rap CDs that I had ever heard. My brother bought it when it first came out, and boy am I glad he exposed me to it. Snoop pioneered the way for the G-Funk style of rap, and it produced such artists as Warren G and Kurupt. Classics like Gin and Juice, Who Am I, and Murder Was the Case give this album its popularity, while tracks like Gz and Hustlas, Aint No Fun, and Lodi Dodi keep the album give the album great beats. <br /> <br />I had to write this review because I read the review of this \\"Helen\\" character. Obviously, since she gave every song on the album a 1/5 or less, I had to check out her other reviews. I noticed that she said that Nelly, in his latest two albums (Sweat and Suit), was \\"The greatest hip-hop i've ever heard, i'm truthfully amazed. This is an extraordinary effort by the realest hip-hop artist yet. He has got the sweetest voice i've ever heard, snoopy dogg and the genius is nothing in comparision to this guy, this album shows what real hip-hop is all about, i guess.\\" <br /> <br />Hmm. I \\"guess\\" that you are a total moron. Don't post whether or not you think someone is a real hip-hop artist if you are a 12 year old girl with no brain.

0553801503|2.0|Sorry Mr. Martin, but I, as well as others, think this book had one main point - to net some coin (maybe the secondary reason was just wanting to get something to the clamouring readers).  I have been touting the series as the best since Tolkien...until this book.  <br /> <br />Most of this work could have been put into one chapter each of the main characters and this would likely have sustained the original story. A few chapters in I became bored with the book and the onslaught of character names. The editors should be red-faced over this book which is the downfall of an amazing series thusfar. Great reading is always a combination of great writing AND great editing and the latter was certainly missing.

B0000DIXDR|3.0|Movement and color aid in the identification of character's personalities because warm colors and motion represent Frances `Baby' Houseman's radiant energy and aspiration and because cool colors and stillness represent Lisa Houseman's insignificant, unsuccessful role. In addition, the physical appearance of each sister suits her character well.  <br />     Contrary to the norm, I viewed the sequel, Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, before I had ever seen the original film, Dirty Dancing. I am basing this information on two occasions that I watched Dirty Dancing. The first time was on November 15, and the second on November 17, 2005. Both viewings were during the evening, in my home. <br /> As Frances `Baby' Houseman learned various dancing techniques, the upward motion of her body seemed soaring and free because it followed the natural tendency to move upward over a composition. Her movement in this direction indicated a strong sense of aspiration and joy as well as a position of power. During various dance routines, Baby often moved assertively toward the camera, reinforcing her confidence. This closeness also forced the audience to follow Baby on a more personal level throughout the film. The red, orange, yellow, and pink colored dresses that Baby wore were stimulating, attractive, and clearly portrayed her radiant energy.    <br /> Cool colors, including blue, green, and gray, were worn predominantly by Lisa Houseman. Lisa played a much more subtle role than her sister, Baby. Her movements seemed to be choreographed with much less complexity that was hard to appreciate as opposed to the kinetic richness and beauty of Baby's dances. The relationship between the audience and Lisa was distant and rather impersonal because she often withdrew from the camera. Uncomfortable stillness upheld her role.  <br /> In addition, the sisters' physical appearances suited their character well. Baby was a blue-eyed-blonde of medium height and had a bubbly personality. Stereotypically, this stood behind her successes in the dancing world, and her flamboyant relationships with the opposite sex. Even though she was beautiful, Lisa's pale skin, brown hair, and brown eyes, made her role much less memorable. <br /> Symbolic expressions powerfully reinforce each actor's character in the film Dirty Dancing. <br />
B000007RYQ|5.0|it's not pure as in so many anally treated works of Mahler. admittedly i am not interested in listening to see if the sonority of the instruments is perfect to some pompous standard, and it's not but there is another dedication here and an unmeasurable energy. i love the youthfulness of this work.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Being a longtime Mode fan, I was excited to see another new album coming out.  In order to give a reference point, I'll say that DM's best releases in no particular order are Black Celebration, Violator, and Songs of Faith and Devotion.  Don't take that the wrong way.  I basically love everything they did up until SoFaD.  Ultra and Exciter were huge letdowns, though; droning, boring, unimaginative drivel from three of the best musicians of the electronic/pop era.  Perhaps their problem stemmed from the departure of Alan Wilder after SoFaD?  It seemed they had simply lost the spark, the emotion.  Where were the Halos?  The Question of Times?  The Condemnations? <br /> <br />One thing to keep in mind here as well is that I have not heard the CD.  I made the mistake of buying the album in advance off iTunes.  What a gigantic mistake.  It sounds horrible.  I sure hope the CD wasn't recorded like that.  I will definitely never buy another iTunes piece of garbage again. <br /> <br />Regardless, after numerous listens and seeing them live on the current tour, I will say that perhaps they are back.  Playing the Angel, while it still lacks the outright passion, angst, lust, and drive of their earlier work, it is abundantly clear that DM will not be written off as another has-been desparately clinging to their youth and stardom.  The tracks they've provided us prove they are still in the game. <br /> <br />If you gave up on Depeche Mode after Ultra and Exciter (both of which were neither Ultra-anything nor exciting), do yourself a favor and give them another chance.  You will not be disappointed.  You will want to give this album a few listens before you pass judgment, but isn't that always the case?  I am certainly glad they are back, and thankfully even Dave realizes he can't still pull off all those moves on the stage like he did 15 years ago.  There is no attempt at reliving glory days here, just more incredible music from the pipeline.
0316168815|4.0|This book written by Alice Sebold is one of the best i have ever read. It is about a girl named Susie Salmon who has been raped and murdered by a man in her neighborhood. Even though she is no-longer alive she continues to tell her story in heaven. She gets to see how her family changes, grows, and seperates with her lose. She watches as her close group of friends all grow up and how much they all change. Even though she misses how she can  never grow up like a normal teenager she loves to watch from above at all of her loved ones. She gets to connect with people in a different way that know one else will ever be able to. This book allows to go on the journey with her through the good, bad, sad and even the unknown. Its touching and very addicting. I gaurentte after the first page you wont be able to set it down.
0156027321|5.0|This is the kind of book that keeps you reading and reading because of the richness and curiosity of what is waiting at every turn of the story. No matter how you capture the message it is one of so much perseverance, hope and making life an adventure by seeing it with the eyes of the soul.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Okay, I'll start with the good news. This is definitely a good album, and by far Priest's best effort since 'Painkiller', after time of sadness with Ripper Owens, when they released 'Jugulator' (which was decent, in my humble opinion) and 'Demolition' (considered by many fans to be JP's worst, it was poor but I believe 'Rocka Rolla' is their worst). Musically this is one badass album, the solos are great, the drumming is great, there are no songs you'd wan't to skip.  I still give this album only 4 stars just because it is not very original. The highlights are the opening track 'Judas Rising', 'Deal With The Devil', which sounds like their biggest hits 'Another Thing Coming' and 'Breaking The Law', the ballad 'Angel' (an amazing one), the progressive 'Lochness', Priest's longest song to date, remminds 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner' by Iron Maiden, the poem is about seas as well. 'Hellrider' & 'Demonizer' are the heaviest songs on the album and two of the best on the album. All the other songs are pretty forgettable, by no mean bad songs, just nothing special. My other complaint is that the lyrics on the album don't really make sense. Much like what Metallica did on their newer stuff, Priest took older lyrics they wrote and mixed them, and sometimes it sounds just dumb. However, Rob Halford's voice sounds better than ever.  This is also very similar to Painkiller, it is heavy, not as cheesy but in some tracks there is chessiness (the cheesiness and goofiness in that album didn't stop it from being their best album). Some tracks are more similar to early Priest (pre-Turbo).  While this is a very solid comeback release, in my opinion, it isn't par with 'Brave New World' (Maiden) or 'The Gathering' (Testament), but when considering their age it's really good. You might check out also Halford solos 'Crucible' and 'Resurrection', which in my opinion are even better. However it is still way better than all the mainstream s**t is out today like Ashlee Simpson, Limp Bizkit and Coldplay. Still, a must have for any JP fan.

B0002CHIJW|1.0|I watched this movie sometime in the late 80's. It disturbed me <br />to the point that I've never forgotten it, and never will. <br />Take my advise and don't fill your mind with this trash. It will <br />stain your soul. If you like to see lots and lots of violent rape <br />then this movie is for you and you need help. I can't imagine <br />why anyone would make this movie.

B000021XS0|5.0|This is by, by far, Dream Theater's BEST album.  Images and Words and Awake are great, but I just don't see how they can compare to SFAM.  For their first stab at a concept album, they did a pretty damn good job-- better-- AMAZING job.  The storyline is great but the music is even better; it's engaging, captivating, and balanced, with a variety of styles and influences presented throughout the album.  And, of course, all of this is blended in with DT's masterfully crafted, damn near legendary musical technicalities.  I won't go into details about the storyline, but I'll do my best to offer my general thoughts on each track.   <br /> <br />1.  Regression: SFAM opens with the sound of a ticking clock and the soothing voice of the main character's shrink.  LaBrie comes in softly while Petrucci gently strums on his guitar, and it couldn't have been done better.  Smooth, perfect intro.   <br /> <br />2.  Overture 1928:  Wow.  Probably one of DT's best-- if not the best-- instrumental piece.  Great guitar work here, great keyboards, hell, great everything.  Strikingly engaging melodies-- you'll like it instantly.  Short for DT, but very, very sweet. <br /> <br />3.  Strange Deja Vu:  Here, the storyline begins to unfold.  EXCELLENT performance by LaBrie, and great performances from the rest of the band as well.  Again, captivating melodies.  This song flows perfectly, going from slower, haunting riffs and vocals and more patient drumming to a heavier upbeat, edge-of-your-seat style with slightly more aggressive vocals, and then back again.  Awesome ending. <br /> <br />4.  Through my words:  Beautiful, soothing transition.  Nice vocals.  James LaBrie owns you. <br /> <br />5.  Fatal Tragedy:  Storyline develops further.  Striking and haunting, especially on vocals.  James employs a slightly more cryptic tone when he comes in on \\"I shut the door and traveled to another home,\\" and it works perfectly.  AWESOME keyboards-- one of Rudess's finer performances.  Smooth drummingtransitions, smooth guitar backing, smooth everything; great synergy here.  Nice soloing towards the end of the song by both Petrucci and Rudess, and you gotta love Portnoy's syncopated drumming.  Awesome. <br /> <br />6.  Beyound this life:  The first \\"epic\\" on Scenes From A Memory.  Heavier than previous tracks.  Storyline turns violent.  This is where SFAM really starts to drag you in.  Petrucci really struts his stuff in this piece, but at no point does it take away from the overall experience.  Great melodies offered by LaBrie during the choruses, and great soloing offered by Rudess as well.  Very strong track.   <br /> <br />7.  Through her eyes:  Slooooow down.  Soft, slow, beautiful song.  Dreamy keyboard effects, gentle electric guitar, cooled-down drumming, and emotionally charged vocals.  Background piano really adds to the overall effect of the song.  Masterfully placed key change around the 3 minute mark.  And just when you thought Dream Theater had cooled down, we have... <br /> <br />8.  HOME:  Best song on the album, as other reviewers have taken the liberty of mentioning.  They aren't lying-- this is probably DT's strongest track not only in Scenes From A Memory, but in their entire eight-album catalog.  Starts off with a slow, ethnically influenced guitars and keyboards, with some nice chime-splashing effects added in by Portnoy.  After this, HEAVY, HEAVY, HEAVY.  And AWESOME.  LaBrie's vocals SOAR-- AMAZING chorus in this piece; I've listened to it literally thousands of times and I'm still not sick of it.  INCREDIBLE soloing by Rudess and Petrucci towards the middle of the song, guaranteed to leave you breathless.  After the soloing, it returns once again to the latter part of the main chorus of the song with \\"Her story/ It holds the key.\\"  Flawless transition.  Ends in a similar fashion as it starts, with Petrucci and Rudess jamming away with an ethnically influenced sound.  Final note from the guitar is soul-shattering.  Quite possibly the greatest hard rock song of all time.  Doesn't get much better than this.   <br /> <br />9.  Dance of Eternity:  A damn fine instrumental piece which sounds a lot like like \\"Metropolis pt. 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper\\" at many points-- not a coincidence.  I really love the ragtime piano effects offered by Rudess in this piece.  Although I don't like it as much as \\"Overture 1928,\\" \\"The Dance of Eternity,\\" is still an epic, damn near perfect instrumental offering.  Probably Myung's best bass work on the entire album.  Gotta love.   <br /> <br />10.  One last time:  Re-enter neo-prog type sound.  Awesome keyboards, and beautiful development throughout the song.  Gets really great towards the end with LaBrie's building vocals.  Gently leads into... <br /> <br />11.  The Spirit Carries On:  Beautiful, softly written song with a gospel-type sound.  Dream Theater really displays their ability to master different styles of music here, because this couldn't sound more different from something like \\"Home.\\"  LaBrie starts off gently down the octave, then goes up the octave, and enter John Petrucci with some awesome, emotionally charged shredding.  LaBrie re-enters with an entire gospel choir behind him, and the effect is amazing.  Awesome song. <br /> <br />12.  Finally Free:  Dramatic conclusion of SFAM, once again beginning with the voice of the main character's shrink.  DT revisits many of the styles from previous songs in this piece, conveying both hopefulness and uncertainty.  Dramatic shooting scene, and really dramatic vocals towards the end.  BEATIFUL acoustic break towards the end really puts a nail on the song.  Haunting guitars and aggressive drumming approach the end of the song, which contains a \\"scene\\" from the storyline and ends with a huge sense of uncertainty.  Incredible ending. <br /> <br />If you're new to DT, this wouldn't be a bad place to start, and if you already own and love one or more DT albums, you haven't lived until you pick this one up.  This is quite possibly one of the greatest albums of all time.  Add to cart.  Now.
6305499365|5.0|Office Space was a huge flop in theatres when released in 1999, but I went to see it the week it was released.  (I think it was gone from the theatres after one week!)<br /><br />Actually I called in sick to work to go see it, because I was a huge fan of Mike Judge's work-- and I loved idea of Office Space.<br /><br />After seeing the movie, I was hooked.  I told everyone at my then place of employment about it-- I didn't mention I was there during working hours.  Office Space was VERY descriptive of my then-current occupation.<br /><br />Regardless of your personal situtation, you will find a lot to like with this movie.  The laughs are non-stop, from the opening sequence of the commute to work on through.<br /><br />The bits with Milton, are a little disjointed from the main story-- but fans of Judge's Milton cartoon shorts will be pleased with their inclusion, and the expansion of Milton's boss into divisional VP Bill Lumburgh, the principal antagonist of Peter Gibbons and his friends.<br /><br />With numerous hilarious scenes, in which any white collar worker will see bit of their own job, Office Space is a great movie.<br /><br />After seeing Office Space just once in the theatre, I realized I had to get out of my dead-end job.  As I said, it changed my life-- even if it doesn't change yours, it's a great film to watch.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Upon its release, this movie was celebrated as a \\"mature\\" love story and isn't it great that Hollywood is finally reaching an older demographic?<br /><br />I'm somewhat insulted by that praise, only because I was 33 when I saw this film for the first time and immediately loved it.<br /><br />The chemistry between Nicholson and Keaton is solid and unnerving. When they're on screen together, the craft just drops away and we are voyuers to their every word and movement.<br /><br />The script is quick-witted and smart. I love the plot technique of the play-within-a-play written by Keaton's Erica Barry that exacts a dramatic and hysterical revenge on everything Nicholson's Harry has done. I think it's something that every woman who writes dreams of doing.<br /><br />The Keanu Reeves character (Julian the doctor) felt weird and oddly placed, although when DOESN'T a Keanu Reeves character feel weird and oddly placed?<br /><br />I would have liked to see more of Frances McDormand only because I find her acerbic delivery delicious.<br /><br />Is that an \\"I love you\\" or an \\"I love YA\\"?
B000BKVQTS|2.0|This is an okay film.  I'd have given it 3 stars, but it ended up boring me a little so I had to subract a little for that.    The idea of a \\"scary fairy tale\\" movie is great, but it takes more than a few scattered references to old stories to raise an otherwise predictable plot.  The characters were poorly defined, and the Wicked Queen was ultimately a disappointing baddie.  Not terrible, but too long and too complicated.    ALMOST SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH (YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED)  There's a few logic problems as well.  For instance, one of the brothers is stabbed twice in the heart.  But at the end of the movie, he's all right.  That's a cop out.  Also, the Queen's one weakness is her mirror, which she utterly fails to protect in any way.  Another weak aspect.  Finally, I kitten gets chopped up for humor in one scene.  I know it's just a film and no cats were hurt, but it didn't add anything to the movie for  me.  Worse, it wasn't even funny.    Eh, it was okay.  Could've been worse, but nothing worth watching twice.

B000BVEKO0|5.0|To fully understand my point of view on this album, you should probably know a little about my history with Korn. They were the band that introduced me to rock music. Period. My first love. The songs that introduced me to them were Freak on a Leash and Got the Life. What made the music so appealing to me was the fact that it was hard and relentless, yet it was (for lack of a better word) groovy. The songs had a definite beat to them, which made their hip hop influences obvious. The guitars were unlike anything I had ever heard before, which only made the songs more interesting and different. Of course, the biggest piece of the puzzle (and the best if I may say so) is Jon's voice. It is one of the most unusual, pleasing voices in hard rock. It can be easily immitated (poorly), but never replicated. <br /> <br />That having been said, now you know what side of Korn drew me to them in the first place. I was not familiar with the dryer, bluntly edged sound of their earlier works until later. Since that time, I have purchased every Korn album and loved them for what they were, as different as they may have been. The album that kind of turned me off was Take a Look in the Mirror. To me, it sounded like Korn was trying too hard to be \\"heavy\\" again. I never realized Korn stopped being heavy, but according to some fans, apparently they did. And so Korn tried to compensate with this (as one reviewer said) mediocre album. I didn't listen to Korn for over a year until I heard Word Up on the radio (During that time, my musical tastes expanded. I discovered the wonderful sounds of The Smashing Pumpkins, Bjork, and Radiohead to name a few. That tells you a little something about my musical tastes when picking up the new album). Word Up reminded me of Got the Life very much, and so I couldn't get enough. I finally felt that Korn was relaxing, being themselves again, not trying to force anything out. When news of this new album surfaced, I was hopeful that they would maintain this state of mind. And did they? Yes, they did. And then some. <br /> <br />This album is, in my opinion, the best thing the band has done since Issues. I liked Untouchables a lot, but it just didn't pack that punch I had hoped it would. Also, the songs weren't as memorable as they could have been, in my opinion. This album, however, floods your ears with Munky's familiar distorted effects, the return of Fieldy's funky bass (not just that scattered, unorganized slapping heard on the previous effort), David's catchiest drums ever (think Kick the P.A.), and Jon's voice at its very best, angst-ridden when it needs to be, soft when the emotion of sorrow is needed over that of anger (finally, more of that sound we got a taste of on Hollow Life and Dirty).  <br /> <br />My favorite tracks are Open Up, Coming Undone, Tearjerker, and (of course) Twisted Transistor, the best single Korn has put out in a long time (I was really unsatisfied with Ya'll Want a Single). Another note: This album features use of more electonica elements than ever before (something I am very happy about), the return of Jon's scat (made famous on songs like Freak on a Leash and Twist), as well as tons of bagpipes. My only complaint is that the interludes were going to be separate tracks originally, similar to how they were on Issues, but instead were just placed on the ends of songs. This is a picky problem if you plan on making a mix with just one of these songs on your playlist. Also, the artwork is particularly amazing, especially with the Deluxe version, seeing as how it actually has a \\"pop-up book\\" type of effect. <br /> <br />Also, the bonus disc is worth the money. The b-sides are just as good as the album tracks, believe it or not. The Last Legal Drug is one of the best songs from their new recording sessions, and I have no idea why it was left off of the album. Also, the remixes are actually very creative and special in their own way. You can actually remember them after listening to them, something most remixes don't accomplish. <br /> <br />Anyway, if you liked Take a Look in the Mirror or didn't think that that album was even heavy enough (My god, how heavy does a song have to be for you to call it heavy? This is Korn, not Slipknot. These guys have intellect and creativity when they're not afraid to show it because of you harsh \\"true fans\\"), then you might not like this album. If you loved Issues and Untouchables (and, less specifically, Follow the Leader), then you'll probably love this album to death. They're confident, not afraid to be themselves and demonstrate what they really are: Artists. This album was good enough to make me come out of a 6 month cease of reviewing. :) That should say something.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I've been listening to the album for the past few months and I'm discovering things about it every day. It's a little hard to get the full effect of an album the first time you hear it. I really think that you have to listen to it a few times before you get the whole effect of it. The album is their 8th studio release and this year also marks their 20th aniversary. Octavarium is 8 tracks in length and one great album, one of the best they have released. Its Hard to say which Album of Dream Theater's is the best but Octavarium is one of my favorites. Octavarium is the first studio album that Dream Theater has done in the past three years. The album is done extremely well Petrucci and Portnoy have produced another masterpiece. The cool thing with this album that they have done is made it playable from start to finish. Like a concept album but it's not a concept album. There are no breaks in the album once the music stops in between tracks. There are still small sounds and effects going on. And example of this is between \\"The Root of All Evil\\" and the \\"Answer Lies Within\\" you hear crickets and birds singing, and a church bell chiming. It's not a full concept album like Scenes from a memory. The post production of the album is done very well. I will go through the album's 8 tracks and give you a full report on what I think in this review.     Track 1: The Root of All Evil   The song starts with a Pink Floydish humming back and forth like machine. The intro to the song is really cool how it grows and then pops right into the main riff of the song. The main riff is really crunchy and heavy. The song has a good pace and grove to it and very aggressive and chunky. TROAE is by far one of the heaviest songs on the album. Labrie's vocals are really good on this first song. I think the recycled some of the lyrics from Train of Thought. \\" I can feel my body breaking, I can feel my body shaking.\\" It's the same lines from \\"Dying Soul\\" on \\"Train of Thought\\". I like them putting this in and it sounds really similar in the way Labrie sings it. I thick it's pretty cool. Just like in \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" when they played a little bit from \\"Metropolis 1\\". The \\"Root of All Evil\\" is a good song to start the album out with.     Track 2: The Answer Lies Within  \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" is an good ballad. I think this is the first time I've heard Dream Theater do anything with any other accompanying instruments since \\"Awake\\". But on this song they play with an orchestra. The lyrics are very moving and positive. \\"You've got the future on your side\\" \\"Gonna be fine now, I know whatever you decide your gonna shine\\". \\"Don't let the day go by, don't let it end\\".     Track 3: These Walls   The song starts out with Petrucci cranking on his guitar making it sound like a monster. It sounds really cool. Then it kicks into the main part of the song. Labrie's vocals on this song are again at their peak. Awesome vocals. Jordan Dudes does a killer job with keyboard on this as well. I love the keyboard in this song. IT accompanies the base and guitar well, very powerful.     Track 4: I Walk Beside You   The transition from \\"These Walls\\" to \\"I Walk Beside You\\" has that same clock ticking from \\"Scenes From a Memory\\". \\"I Walk Beside You\\" is a very religious song written by John Petrucci. A lot of his writing I feel is faith driven and there is no problem with that. The lyrics are like that old Footprints poem. God is always walking beside you. This could be a possible Single for the radio. It's short at only 4:29 minutes. I think probably the shortest Dream Theater song ever.     Track 5: Panic Attack   This is probably one of the heaviest Songs the Dream Theater has written. It is just a killer song. Comes straight out smacking you in the face with a really killer, crunchy riff. Portnoy on some part I have no clue how he keeps up on the ride cymbal, I think those are 64th notes that he is playing. The guitar solo is also impressive. There is one bit in the song at theend where Petrucci and Rudess's are harmonizing is really cool.     Track 6: Never Enough  Another heavy starter. But slows down a bit. The main riff in the song is really cool. I love how they are all playing together through this heavy riff. Another good song.    Tack 7: Sacrificed Sons   An excellent song both musically and lyrically. Petrucci wrote the lyrics and they are very deep. Going back to the 9/11 tragedy. What I get from this song is it is about the sons that died in the 9/11 tragedy; the sons of police and firefighters.     Track 8: Octavarium   23+ minutes of greatness. Listening to the song, I can tell a lot of the influences that Dream Theater has. Pink Floyd, Genesis and Yes. Around the 12th minute of the song, Jordan Rudes kicks into an awesome keyboard solo that is having the members of Yes bowing to him. And incredible piece of music. There are 4 parts to the song. It starts slowly and just progresses to a peak, where James Labrie is screaming at the top of his lungs. This is right up your alley if you are \\"A Change of Seasons\\" fan. I put it right up there with \\"A Change of Seasons\\". I'd love to see the guys do this song live as a replacement to \\"A Change of Seasons\\". I still love \\"A Change of Seasons\\" but \\"Octavarium\\" is a 23 minute masterpiece.     Final Thoughts  In all Octavarium is an excellent album to top as theri 20th annaversary album. There are a bunch of hidden things with then album on the outside cover as well as in the music. The way the group did this is puere genius. See how many things you can find that are 5 or eight? A couple hints. How Many DT members? How many have there been? How many notes in an Octive? Look at teh album cover adn see the piano keys? 5 black keys, 8 white keys? On the CD what do you see? An octagon with a Star in the middle? 8 adn 5 again. How many Albums does DT have? 8 studio, 5 live/eps. 5 and 8 again. It;s all over this  Dream Theater album. I give the album 5 out of 5. I also highly recommend James Labrie's solo album \\"Elements of Persuasion\\"     (...)
B000BMSTMS|5.0|To fully understand my point of view on this album, you should probably know a little about my history with Korn. They were the band that introduced me to rock music. Period. My first love. The songs that introduced me to them were Freak on a Leash and Got the Life. What made the music so appealing to me was the fact that it was hard and relentless, yet it was (for lack of a better word) groovy. The songs had a definite beat to them, which made their hip hop influences obvious. The guitars were unlike anything I had ever heard before, which only made the songs more interesting and different. Of course, the biggest piece of the puzzle (and the best if I may say so) is Jon's voice. It is one of the most unusual, pleasing voices in hard rock. It can be easily immitated (poorly), but never replicated. <br /> <br />That having been said, now you know what side of Korn drew me to them in the first place. I was not familiar with the dryer, bluntly edged sound of their earlier works until later. Since that time, I have purchased every Korn album and loved them for what they were, as different as they may have been. The album that kind of turned me off was Take a Look in the Mirror. To me, it sounded like Korn was trying too hard to be \\"heavy\\" again. I never realized Korn stopped being heavy, but according to some fans, apparently they did. And so Korn tried to compensate with this (as one reviewer said) mediocre album. I didn't listen to Korn for over a year until I heard Word Up on the radio (During that time, my musical tastes expanded. I discovered the wonderful sounds of The Smashing Pumpkins, Bjork, and Radiohead to name a few. That tells you a little something about my musical tastes when picking up the new album). Word Up reminded me of Got the Life very much, and so I couldn't get enough. I finally felt that Korn was relaxing, being themselves again, not trying to force anything out. When news of this new album surfaced, I was hopeful that they would maintain this state of mind. And did they? Yes, they did. And then some. <br /> <br />This album is, in my opinion, the best thing the band has done since Issues. I liked Untouchables a lot, but it just didn't pack that punch I had hoped it would. Also, the songs weren't as memorable as they could have been, in my opinion. This album, however, floods your ears with Munky's familiar distorted effects, the return of Fieldy's funky bass (not just that scattered, unorganized slapping heard on the previous effort), David's catchiest drums ever (think Kick the P.A.), and Jon's voice at its very best, angst-ridden when it needs to be, soft when the emotion of sorrow is needed over that of anger (finally, more of that sound we got a taste of on Hollow Life and Dirty).  <br /> <br />My favorite tracks are Open Up, Coming Undone, Tearjerker, and (of course) Twisted Transistor, the best single Korn has put out in a long time (I was really unsatisfied with Ya'll Want a Single). Another note: This album features use of more electonica elements than ever before (something I am very happy about), the return of Jon's scat (made famous on songs like Freak on a Leash and Twist), as well as tons of bagpipes. My only complaint is that the interludes were going to be separate tracks originally, similar to how they were on Issues, but instead were just placed on the ends of songs. This is a picky problem if you plan on making a mix with just one of these songs on your playlist. Also, the artwork is particularly amazing, especially with the Deluxe version, seeing as how it actually has a \\"pop-up book\\" type of effect. <br /> <br />Also, the bonus disc is worth the money. The b-sides are just as good as the album tracks, believe it or not. The Last Legal Drug is one of the best songs from their new recording sessions, and I have no idea why it was left off of the album. Also, the remixes are actually very creative and special in their own way. You can actually remember them after listening to them, something most remixes don't accomplish. <br /> <br />Anyway, if you liked Take a Look in the Mirror or didn't think that that album was even heavy enough (My god, how heavy does a song have to be for you to call it heavy? This is Korn, not Slipknot. These guys have intellect and creativity when they're not afraid to show it because of you harsh \\"true fans\\"), then you might not like this album. If you loved Issues and Untouchables (and, less specifically, Follow the Leader), then you'll probably love this album to death. They're confident, not afraid to be themselves and demonstrate what they really are: Artists. This album was good enough to make me come out of a 6 month cease of reviewing. :) That should say something.
B000AMWIVM|4.0|Saw is not the kind of movie which will make you wanna shut your eyes,grab the arm of the person sitting with you,make you jump from your couch and the other things one expects from a movie that is believed to be of much horror and brutality. I saw it last night and I think it is well almost worth the hype owing to the things that you have to explain to yourself rather than let the movie do it for you.<br /><br />The most possible reason for my curiousity for this movie is the amount of ridicule and disappointment people feel for Saw2. This movie was never released in my city but I had to wait and get a dvd from somewhere. It is a 100 minute film and just when your brain starts wondering what is going to happen next it hits with you two or three shocker moments. I must add that the music in the film adds to the tension and strange feeling of admirable awe it arose in me.<br /><br />WHO IS THIS MOVIE FOR?<br /><br />I wouldnt say this movie is for everyone because I am pretty sure a lot of people would find a few flaws and try to explain them to one another. Most people have a \\"we want to hate a movie\\" syndrome so it is defintiely not for those looking to ridicule. What really matters is the unique storyline and the sickness behind a brain that wants to teach you a lesson by playing with your life.<br /><br />WHAT WAS WEAK ABOUT THE FILM?<br /><br />The scenes involving the doctor cheating on his wife and the very poor enactment of a fight by the wife just before the doctor is leaving. Also the scene where he is on the laptop trying to look strangely passionate about his work. The detectives were silly too. However, that is about it cause there's a whole lot of WHOA inducing scenes in this suggestive epic of sorts.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|Self-acknowledged fan-boy.  Can't help it just like that Firefly series.  Never could figure out why it didn't make it - that is until I saw this film.  This movie reminded me of a medicore pilot, not the triumphal return of the series.  Was not too suprised that it did poorly at the box-office.  If this was the 1st thing, we wouldn't have had the Firefly series.  So all that being said, I liked it since it was a chance to see old friends (maybe one last time).  I did like the way it both left the future open and tied together a bunch of Firefly threads.  So my one question (aside from real-life aging) is why do the actors look so different when it is supposed to be just a few months later from the last Firefly episode?  If you like/love Firefly you will enjoy this film, otherwise it is just another soap opera sequel.
B000BVEKO0|5.0|I was worried about this new album after hearing Twisted Transistor. I thought it sounded a little to poppy for KoRn. The rest of the album is awesome. They have taken new steps, yet they have incorporated sounds from their previous albums. They kept their heavy edge with songs like Politics, Liar, Hypocrites, and Coming Undone. They have some slower paced, powerful songs like Throw Me Away, and Love Song. I have listened to this album mulitple time already, and I do not skip a song. <br /> <br />After Take a Look in the Mirror's not so good sales I thought KoRn was dying. Then I heard Head left the band. I was wrong. They have gotten better than ever. Buy this album! If you liked Follow the Leader or Issues, or any KoRn album for that matter, get this. KoRn rocks.
1401207138|5.0|I have read a lot of \\"literature\\" since I first read the Watchmen when I was twelve almost twenty years ago.  Anna Karenina, Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, and lots more.  The Watchmen, without question, smashes them all.  The Watchmen is mind-boggling.  The layers upon layers Moore and Gibbons interweave, all told in a twelve-issue series as neatly synchronized as one of Jon's watches, is a work of art that is hard to fathom.  How two human beings could create this series is a flattering testament to what human beings--albeit unusually gifted human beings--can do.  Beyond Moore's obvious genius, Gibbons' work should be especially noted.  David Gibbons can draw ANYTHING with a documentary-like reality, and that's exactly what he masterfully does in executing Moore's vision.  He is less an artist than a cinematogropher.<br /><br />I often wonder how Moore or Gibbons managed to ever produce anything again after they completed this series since it is obviously the pinnacle of their careers.  Why get out of bed in the morning after you've created THIS?
B000003TAB|3.0|Somewhat hastily thrown together following the mega-success of \\"Nevermind\\", \\"Incesticide\\" features a collection of off-beat Nirvana songs from their pre-fame era.  \\"Dive\\", \\"Sliver\\" and \\"Stain\\" are the highlights, and Nirvana's cover of \\"Molly's Lips\\" is worth a listen.  Not a particularly great album per se, but a must-own collection for the true Nirvana fan.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|Some people crack me up, they complain because some bands don't make albums like their first one. I'll bet these same people would complain if all of korn's album did sound like the first one, complaining that is just rehashing the same old songs over and over again. There are bands that do this however, Nickelback comes to mind..nuff said. <br /> <br />Is this their best album? No, but it's not their worst. I was suprised at how good this album actually turned out. To be together for as long as these guys have and make as many albums as they did and then lose a key member of the band, Korn's sound was almost totally based off of a 2 guitarist system if you think about it, most of their stuff just doesn't work without 2 guitarist. I've been playing the guitar for over 11 years (no I'm not in a band, it's just a hobby i really enjoy) so I realise what it takes to get that to work live. I wonder what they'll do for their live gigs? Anyway, They really came up with a good effort here by evolving their sound and still keeping much of the orginal Korn sound, more than I expected to be honest.  <br /> <br />Bottom line is give it a shot, it's a little different, but by no means bad. Good job guys.
0895260131|1.0|This book is just sad, as well as those who take it as gospel.  They need crap like this to bolster their racism and make them feel better about themselves.  You want to talk balanced, lets have a similar book about Christianity and all the ways in which its been used to murder, rape and torture innocent people.  That would be fair.  Stop hiding behind your cross and realize that Christianity is no better than Islam when it comes to racist principles and hate speech and that the Bible has just as much crap to quote in it as the Koran.  To judge the billion plus practitioners of a religion by extremism will only end badly for Christianity as well.  But it is just to point out that Islam is not a peacable religion.  Well wake up, neither is Christianity.  All religions are outdated and this sort of hatred is endemic to organized religion as a whole.  your ways are tired, your beliefs are outdated, its over.  If you're going to point your finger as a Christian (and the term Christian, as being someone who lives by Christ's teachings and love is used way to f'in loosely in this country) then prepared for the finger to be pointed rightfully back at you!!!  Lets drop this act.  There are plenty of moderate Muslims, Christians, Jews, etc. who want to live together in peace and with acceptance of those who are different.  Read the Gospel of Thomas.  Its time these ultra conservative Christian terrorists stop speaking for you!
B00005JNZJ|5.0|A lot of people are saying bad things about this movie. Some people don't understand it, some people say it betrays the origional series, some people say that the writing was terrible. In actuality, these are all false. This movie is fantastic. It's pacing is incredible, reveling very little story but hinting at what is to come. The writing is comendable, though some of the dialog is stiff. The cenematography is UNBELIEVEABLE, this movie just drips with a wonderful art direction, amazing sets, and a tastefull use of effects. It is VERY confusing at first, because you really have no idea what is going on, why people dissapear and what the hell the Goodchild's are talking about.  <br /> <br />My favorite part about the movie, aside from the amazing art direction and visuals, is the casting. Martin Csokas especially, as the role of Trevor Goodchild. He stands out above the rest of the cast, but the others continue to do a commendable job. Charlize Theron wonderfully depicts Aeon, and her acting is VERY reminiscant of Sarah Connor from Terminator 2. Definitely one of the best leading ladies in hollywood today. There were no real casting flaws at all. Not a single weak actor or weakly written part. <br /> <br />You really care about the characters. At least i did, i really didn't want Trevor to die, or Aeon (for thoes familar with the series, Aeon dies alot, so it was always a possibilty). There were some times i thought the plot would move one way, and it in fact moved a different. I think Riddick and Aeon would make a perfect couple (that'd be some rough sex).  <br /> <br />If you are a fan of science fiction, Equilibrium, 1984, The Andromeda Strain, The Matrix, THX-1138, or Pitch Black, or just a fan of the origional series (yet not a zelot), you will definitely enjoy this movie. <br /> <br />I found the message of rebirth and renewal and the optimistic ending very refreshing. I know some people will feel betrayed by not having a naturalistic ending, but sometimes youjust want to see some good things happen to people. You see this happen, and you leave the theater satisfied and in a positive mood.
B000093BDX|4.0|This is a good comp but not great,if you want great you need to buy 10 or 12 of their cd's as I have and make your own compilation.These guys helped me make it through a stressful 40 years. You can't help but feel happy after thinking about and listening to California Girls or The Warmth of the Sun or my favorite Good Vibrations.Or you would be happy, I'm sure, with their 5 disc box set THE BEACH BOYS Thirty years of the Beach Boys GOOD VIBRATIONS
B000002AQQ|5.0|It says on the album itself \\"32 American Classics\\" and they weren't kidding. A lot of these songs I knew before I started playing the CD (Break on Through, Blowin' in the Wind, etc.) but some of these songs I had forgotten about completely and I was pleased to find that almost every song on this soundtrack is spectacular and truly are classics. Every song fit the mood of the movie in some way and this CD reminds us what great music was once like. I preferred Disc 1 to Disc 2, but you still can't beat the songs on here. Here's the tracks: <br /> <br />Disc 1 <br />1. Elvis Presley \\"Hound Dog\\"-5/5-Timeless classic song.  <br />2. Duane Eddy \\"Rebel Rouser\\"-4/5-Pretty cool trumpet instrumental. <br />3. Clarence \\"Frogman\\" Henry \\"(I Don't Know Why) But I Do\\"-5/5-Really short, but I dig the lyrics to this song. <br />4. The Rooftop Singers \\"Walk Right In\\"-5/5-Very catchy. The simultaneous woman & man vocals work perfectly. <br />5. Wilson Pickett \\"Land of 1000 Dances\\"-5/5-I was amazed to find I've heard this song several times before. Really catchy. <br />6. Joan Baez \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\"-5/5-A cover of the Bob Dylan classic. The cover is actually not that bad. She's pretty good. <br />7. Creedance Clearwater Revival \\"Fortunate Son\\"-5/5-I've heard of CCR, but never heard one of their songs. Until this one. I've heard this song several times before and love it. This is an awesome song in ever aspect. Vocals especially. <br />8. The Four Tops \\"I Can't Help Myslef (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)-5/5-This song has been stuck in my head for a while. It's a great song. <br />9. Aretha Franklin \\"Respect\\"-5/5-Everyone has heard this song so I don't even need to comment on it. <br />10. Bob Dylan \\"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\\"-5/5-I had never actually heard this song, but I will agree with Dylan's quote \\"Everybody must get stoned.\\" <br />11. The Beach Boys \\"Sloop John B\\"-4/5-It's the Beach Boys...'Nuff said. <br />12. The Mamas & the Papas \\"California Dreamin'\\"-5/5-First song I've ever heardby M&TP and I like it. The guys voice is better than the girls though. <br />13. Buffalo Springfield \\"For What It's Worth\\"-5/5-Rush would later do a cover of this song. It's hard to decide which I like better but they both are excellent. <br />14. Jackie De Shannon \\"What the World Needs Now is Love\\"-5/5-Great lyrics. Shannon's got a beautiful voice to go along with the lyrics. <br />15. The Doors \\"Break on Through\\"-5/5-One of my favorite Doors songs and a wonderful addition to the soundtrack. <br />16. Simon & Garfunkel \\"Mrs. Robinson\\"-5/5-I'd never heard this song in it's entirety. Only in bits & pieces, I was surprised to find that this is an awesome song. <br /> <br />Disc 2 <br />1. Jefferson Airplane \\"Volunteers\\"-4/5-This song's OK. It sounds like a guy singing and I could have sworn (guess I'm wrong though) was that Grace Slick was the lead singer. <br />2. The Youngbloods \\"Let's Get Together\\"-4/5-Now I know what song Kurt Cobain was making fun of in the beginning of the Nirvana song \\"Territorial Pissings\\". I like this song, but it's not that great. <br />3. Scott McKenzie \\"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Some Flowers in Your Hair)-4/5-There's names for those \\"gentle people of San Francisco\\". This song is funny, but it's not that great of a song. <br />4. The Byrds \\"Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There is a Season)-5/5-This song is kinda catchy; Lyrics are...Strange. <br />5. The Fifth Demension \\"Medley: Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\\"-4/5-This songs a bit weird; but it's an OK song. Sounds like a black church choir singing about sunshine. <br />6. Harry Nilsson \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\"-5/5-Great song. Probably remembered most for being played a lot in the movie \\"Midnight Cowboy\\". <br />7. Three Dog Night \\"Joy to the World\\"-5/5-One of the best songs on the soundtrack and probably the best on this disc.  <br />8. The Supremes \\"Stoned Love\\"-4/5-What the hell is this song about? <br />9. BJ Thomas \\"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head\\"-5/5-A classic song. <br />10. Randy Newman \\"Mr. President (Have Pity on the Working Man)\\"-2/5- <br />I can not stand Newman's voice. This may be a great song, but I'll never know because I can't force myself to listen to the entire song. <br />11. Lynyrd Skynyrd \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\"-5/5-Who doesn't like this song. <br />It's overplayed by now, but I rarely hear it, so...Great song. <br />12. The Doobie Brothers \\"It Keeps You Runnin'\\"-3/5-It's got a trippy electronic beat to it, but vocally it's not that great. Don't get me wrong, I love his voice. But this song just isn't that great. <br />13. Gladys Knight & the Pips \\"I've Got to Use My Imagination\\"-4/5-The song is good, but it's not a song that stays with you. You'll forget it in a couple of hours. <br />14. Willie Nelson \\"On the Road Again\\"-5/5-Played in almost every movie where there is a shot of a long stretch of road. The song is timeless. <br />15. Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band \\"Against the Wind\\"-5/5-What a great song. Both lyrically and musically this song shines. <br />16. Alan Silvestri \\"Forrest Gump Suite\\"-5/5-An 8-minute score of music placed in \\"Forrest Gump\\" besides the rock. It's a great score, but a bit out of place. <br /> <br />A
B00008AWOG|5.0|This album is a perfect example of what Opeth is: two extremes.  The album has bone crushing metal, and some of the most beautiful classical inluenced passages you will here.  This masterpiece starts out with \\"The Moor\\".  This song is metal at it's best.  \\"The Godhead's Lament\\" has some awesome riffs and the clean singing is awesome.  \\"Benighted\\" is probably my favorite mellow Opeth tune.  Mikael's vocals just sooth the savage beast.  \\"Moonlapse Vertigo\\" is one of my top 5 favorite Opeth songs.  The interplay between metal and mellow is awesome.  I usually don't like the growls but they really fit in this song.  \\"Face of Melinda\\" has no growls, just great metal and beautiful singing.  The final two tracks are the typical Opeth metal tunes.  This is one hell of an album.  If you are looking for a good start for Opeth, Still Life is a good choice.
B000002J09|5.0|In truth, this is only the third Zeppelin album I've listened too(the others being \\"II\\" & \\"Houses of the Holy\\") and I used to think II was their best until listening to this fine album. This is called by many Zeppelin fans their best album, also because it includes Zeppelin's biggest (or at least most well known) song \\"Stairway to Heaven\\". Well, in my opinion that song isn't even the best on here. Every song is good (Zeppelin fans will hate me, but I wasn't a big fan of the slower more folkie songs) and I think \\"Black Dog\\" is one of the coolest, catchiest songs I've ever heard. Here's the tracks & my opinions: <br /> <br />1. Black Dog-5/5-\\"Hey hey mama, said the way you move. Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove.\\" This song is killer; one of their best. <br />2. Rock and Roll-5/5-Very cool.  <br />3. The Battle of Evermore-5/5-Very Tolkien-esque song. It's not catchy or anything, not the best song either; But it still is damn good. <br />4. Stairway to Heaven-5/5-Everyone knows this song. It's called Zeppelin's best song and I don't think it's their best, but it's an amazing song. Lyrically, it's probably their best. <br />5. Misty Mountain Hop-5/5-Really catchy song. Get's stuck in your head, simalar to \\"Ramble On\\" from Led Zeppelin II. <br />6. Four Sticks-4/5-I thought this song was a bit annoying, but the drumming is pretty cool. <br />7. Going to California-4/5-The slowest song on the album. I like the song though and ya know what? Who doesn't want to go to California. <br />8. When the Levee Breaks-5/5-I love this song. Some of Plant's best vocals; Bonham, Page, & Jones play well too. <br /> <br />A+
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Joss Whedon's \\"Serenity\\" is everything George Lucas got right in his original Star Wars trilogy, and everything that was missing from his latest three films. <br /> <br />Whedon's strengths are his ability to create great characters (and make you care about them almost instantly), his terrific way with dialogue, his wit, and a penchant for moments of angst that just make you wanna cry.  All these talents and more are shown off wonderfully in \\"Serenity.\\"  Other reviews here go into much greater detail, but simply put, this was not just the best sci-fi film of 2005 (miles better than \\"Revenge of the Sith\\"), but one of the best among any genre, period.
B000002VJH|4.0|I personally got ONE FROM THE VAULT first, which is a two disc live album that absolutely blows everything else out of the water. Thats what I think anyway, ONE FROM... opened me up to any other true DEAD experience I've ever had, its an absolute masterpiece.<br /><br />What does that have to do with this album? Well, a good portion of THE VAULT album is dedicated to this album. The show was performed in front of a specially selected audience in order to let them hear the \\"new\\" sound, that this album would hold. Mickey Hart was back on a drum kit, and I believe it was the first time he was in the line up with the Keith/Donna Jean fraction of the band. Well, the sound they showed off live, is way more solid than the album itself. They play every song from this album, with an absolute focus, tight. It is possibly the tightest you will ever hear The DEAD. Yet, the feeling is complete freedom.<br /><br />The studio album BLUES FOR ALLAH is good, but after you hear it performed in its entirety (with a heaping of other tunes tossed in for good measure) on ONE FROM THE VAULT, theres no going back. I'd save the trouble and just get ONE FROM THE VAULT.

Having said this, I can tell you in all confidence that Takk is absolutely the best album I have ever heard and is DEFINITELY worth the purchase. Listening to this album will literally change your life for the better. It is comprised of track after track of sheer bliss.
B00004Z400|4.0|First off there are way way to many nu metal references to the Deftones. The Deftones were around before that term was even said. ANYWAY, I really like White Pony. Even though not near as heavy as Adreline, this is a great leap that shows some great muscianship and there is some great song writing here. If you are looking for the rawness of The first two CD's, then you won't find it on White Pony (even though there are some pretty damn dark songs on here) but give it a chance as it should grow on you..AND PLEASE STOP CALLING IT NU METAL!!!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|It seems like everyone is either giving this film 5 stars (because they're fanboys) or 1 star (because they didn't particularly like it).  So this movie was either silver screen perfection or absolute garbage, huh?  That's not the point of reviewing.<br /><br />For fans of the show \\"Firefly\\" upon which \\"Serenity\\" is based, the movie will not be a disappointment.  All of the characters from the series return (though Shepherd Book and Inara get relatively little screen time), and the characteristic wit of the cowboy-inspired dialogue never fails to charm and amuse.  That doesn't make this a 5 star movie.<br /><br />While \\"Serenity\\" was entertaining, it was also very dark, especially compared to the series.  The 'Reavers' feature prominently in the plot, along with their rape-and-cannibalize-everything-that-moves M.O.  Fans of the show might be frustrated to note that the plot of the movie resolves the Simon-River subplot from the show, but does not deal with the pasts of Inara or Book--both of whom obviously had more coming.  (Besides that, the movie did a little rewriting of the backstory--compare the first episode of Firefly with the tale of River's rescue recounted in Serenity.)<br /><br />The main villain for the movie wasn't to my taste.  I'm sure some people thought he was the coolest thing since Star Wars...but the enlightened-monk-meets-fallen-angel is a little too comic book, and a little too overdone, for me.<br /><br />The special effects were nice, but the best thing about Whedon's effects from the show--recognition that space is silent--lost to some bizarre desire to include roaring engines just to prove that it can be done.  The music was nothing special, and the scenery and costumes are not noticeably different from the show.<br /><br />This movie gets 4 stars from me because it's a basically good, entertaining movie...but it isn't going to make it on any non-fanboy top ten lists.
B00005A46T|3.0|Slipknot is an interesting piece of work. I think that they are some very good musicians, and a metal band with so many members is a rariety. I purchased this CD when it first came out unfamiler with the band. I found it on sale, and heard about thier act and that they were pretty heavy, and through the first couple of listens, I thought they were a pretty good metal band. Even though they are sellouts (and my definition of sellout isn't because someone gets alot of MTV or radio play, but completely changes their style of music to sell more albums..When you do that, you can't say that the band is playing for what they truly love, but to make songs more FM radio friendly or to go with the flow, so to speak) ANYWAY, this is a pretty good metal album, no matter what their label. Even though I am dissapointed in the direction they took or the new album, this is a good listen for any fan of metal. ENJOY
B000BKJ78U|2.0|The best reason I heard to pick this set up is if you're a Grandparent who wants the set to keep on a shelf for when the kids come over.  For any fan of the series, although the cover art is nice, there's really no reason at all to spring for this.    I know this has been said ad naseum, but Lucas's greed is mind boggling.  To start double-dipping the box-set when it's less then a year-old is shameless at best.    For all their blind, rabid, loyalty over the years Star Wars fans deserve to be treated with more respect then a cash-cow.  I'll never understand Lucas's stubborn refusal to release double-editions of each movie.  It worked WONDERFULLY with the Alien box-set, this is a franchise that's ripe for the same treatment.  Hard-core fans will have their original editions and Lucas will get to keep his versions as the \\"definitive edition.\\"  Everyone wins.    I think at this point, the public has earned the right to choose.    It's a shame that it doesn't look like we'll ever have the opportunity.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|To this day (even though VH hasnt released a CD in years) this remains my favorite VH album and it seems to be a favorite of VH fans. This is a MASTERPIECE and and fan of rock or metal should have this in their collection. This isn't typical VH though, even though Unchained gets the most airplay from this album, the other songs extremly heavy. Just the opening riff in Mean Streets still makes me crank the volume all the way. A treat and its to bad they never matched this record. ENJOY
B000BOH8XW|3.0|...but I thought this album was boring.<br /><br />No seriously. I'm a huge Shakira fan. We're both from the same town in Colombia.<br />I've been trying to get American audiences to listen to her for years, and no one was happier than I when she finally hit.<br />I belong to the fan club.<br />She had me at \\"Hello.\\"<br /><br />I really enjoyed \\"Fijacion Oral, Vol.1\\", and I naturally assumed I was gonna love this too. I even said so in my Amazon review way back when. But I slipped this into my car CD player, and...<br /><br />...nothing.<br /><br />I mean sure, it's impeccably produced and played, and I love her voice with all its' quirks and swoops. She could sing my tax form and I'd love it.<br /><br />But nothing jumped out as being \\"awesome\\" or \\"amazing\\"...things I've come to expect with each of her releases. Beginning with \\"Pies Descalzos\\", she has compiled a staggering catalog of quality albums. Even her Unplugged disc is one of the best they've ever done.<br /><br />\\"Don't Bother\\" is a weak single. The first one off this record should have been \\"bigger\\", yet I don't know which other one to pick.<br />There are a couple of interesting things on the album...I mean, this isn't by any means a BAD record...it's just not nearly as good as anything else she's done in years.<br /><br />Carlos Santana's cameo in \\"Illegal\\" is typically nice. The two Spanish-to-English conversions work, for the most part...actually I think \\"Something\\" improves on its' predecessor.<br /><br />But the melodies aren't as catchy...overall, the songs themselves just aren't as good as on Volume 1.<br /><br />I waited so long for this record...it just bums me out that I'm going to have to wait that much longer for the next one...<br /><br />Shakira fans will have to have this...no question. I would have bought this record even if I read that this was the worst album since \\"Glitter\\". But this is not going to add any fans to her already immense following...
B000002MUQ|5.0|When Sammy first joined VH, let me tell you how Peaved I was. I never thought that he would be able to match the talent of David Lee Roth, and for years I was right. When 5150 first came out in the Spring of 1986, I thought it was a good album (but then I look at the time, and I was only 13) but as I got older, so did VH on my nerves and I refused to by 0U812. For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge did catch my interest as a thought Poundcake was kick ass, but still never matched any album that VH did with LEE ROTH (well except for DIver Down) When the Balance tour came around, a friend of mine got some tickets and since we were both VH fans since 1982, and never got a chance to see them live, I agreed to go see them. First off, we listned to Balance in the ride to the show, and I was very impressed by the CD. I thought it was the best effort that VH had make with Sammy, and after seeing the show (Sammy really kicked ass, and he brought an great energy over the Meadowlands) I started to apprciate him a bit more. This is the best CD with him, and its 2 bad that he would leave after this CD...ENJOY

B00005JNJV|4.0|An edition to this series which is long overdue, Batman Begins tells the story of Bruce Wayne's upbringing, how he came to become the hero behind the mask, and delves into the psychological aspect of not only good versus evil, but also self-examination of one's soul. For this reason, Batman Begins epitomizes more of a thinking man's Batman.  <br /> <br />Much of the first half of the film is used to set the background and roots of who Bruce Wayne is. <br />After witnessing the death of his parents, and feeling a sense of guilt over the tragedy, Bruce Wayne attempts to understand not only the criminal's mind, but the essence of justice as well. After spending time in prison, Wayne encounters Ducard (Liam Neeson), who in turn teaches Wayne how to defend himself and become an impressive fighter. Despite giving Wayne essential advice (\\"if they can't stop you, you can become something else entirely\\"), it is evident that Ducard's scheme of justice comes in the form of completely destroying Gotham. Sensing this, Wayne makes a desperate escape from the League of Shadows, returning to the city. From here we see Bruce Wayne's destiny to become Batman, as he battles the corruptions and injustices which are prevalent in Gotham, choosing to become the symbol of a bat (which perhaps symbolizes his need to overcome the childhood fear of bats).  <br /> <br />Becoming Batman, and returning to Gotham anew, there is not only a method to fight the various forms of evil-crooked police and officials, and the diabolical psychiatrist Dr. Crane..aka The Scarecrow-but an outlet for Bruce's anger at injustices within his own life. This motivation comes through so poignantly, which separates this film from previous others, such as Batman and Robin.  <br /> <br />The cast is also all-star and remarkable in its own right. Katie Holmes plays Rachael, childhood friend of Wayne, and the woman who he eventually falls for. Michael Caine is exquisitely cast as the butler, Alfred, and Morgan Freeman isgreat as man behind the technology who works for Wayne.  <br /> <br />Perhaps most refreshing is the vision and effort of the producers to take a comic-book hero and make him complex. Chris Nolan is able to take the theme of good versus evil and personify it within the characters. Yet, at the same time, the movie still has its action and chase scenes (albeit quite a lengthy one that is a little over the top).  <br /> <br />Batman Begins is the step in the right direction for this series, and this one is on the same playing field as the original Batman.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AP04OM|4.0|Most of you know what the movie is about, so we won't rehash that. While the movie sometimes gets a ribbing for it's too sweet of a story, things aren't always rosy as the family encounters the Nazis. Anyway, Twentieth Century Fox \\"climbed every mountain, followed every rainbow\\" and created the two-disc 40th Anniversary Edition DVD of the Oscar-winning film South of Music. The cast reunites for the first time in 20 years to celebrate and share memories, old and new.<br /><br />Julie Andrews hosts the DVD that contains new documentary material that includes a conversation with Andrews and Christopher Plummer. Andrews talks about the von Trapp family and how their story made it to Broadway and Hollywood. Johannes von Trapp, Plummer, Charmian Carr (Liesl), Wise and others join her. Travel to Salzburg with Carr to see the movie's locales.<br /><br />You can view the film in two ways - the fully-restored original theatrical feature and an interactive version with a sing-along feature so viewers can watch, listen, and sing-along. The sing-along has subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. The movie comes in widescreen format with surround sound capabilities.<br /><br />Also included on DVD is a storyboard gallery, a comparison of the restored film, stills from behind-the-scenes, and trailers. Can you imagine Mia Farrow in the role of Maria? Her screen test brings the imagining to life.<br /><br />The movie is loosely based on the von Trapp family - the documentaries talk about the real family and the differences from the movie. For one, Maria was the strict one, not the Captain. Those interested in such facts get the details.<br /><br />The movie opens with Andrews' introduction and you can watch it while listening to commentary from the original laserdisc by producer and directory Robert Wise. One caveat - and this is common with most DVDs - the extras are not captioned, only the movie and sing-along. Disc two with most of the extras runs for 203 minutes.<br /><br />Once having viewed the two discs, few walk away with unanswered questions as it's a thorough piece of work. For those who have an earlier version of the DVD, the extras come with plenty of material not found on the previous releases. However, if you're not into the facts, behind-the-scenes visits, and the people who made the movie; then you won't miss much. South of Music is superb example of what should come on DVD with extras.ce having viewed the two discs, few walk away with unanswered questions as it's a thorough piece of work.

B000301YY8|5.0|I've read some of the other reviews, about the fact that James Blunt's voice requires some time to get used to, or that his lyrics are corny. <br /> <br />Totally disagree. I heard the song \\"You're beautiful\\" on the radio once and that was enough to make me fall in love hard with this new artist (I mean his music).  He's the best new thing out there right now, because his music and his lyrics are simple and honest. They ring true.  And yes love or stories of break up, or even war for that matter, can be seen as corny, because it's so clich. But that's what life is about. Nobody is reinventing anything here, but the way he sings about them is just magical. <br /> <br />This is the kind of CD I had to, HAD TO, get right away, and I had to go to a few different stores to find it.  Listened to it right away, and liked all the tracks.  Wish there were more (only 10). <br /> <br />He has a certain something in his voice that is both fragile and strong and his songs are not overproduced with tons of arrangements that drown out their beauty.  Frankly, he could sing a capella on most of them and they would be just as beautiful.  Would love to see him perform live.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|Few pop CDs blow me away, pop really has become a bland genre that doesn't earn much credit. However, when you browse through the reviews you'll notice how highly rated Oral Fixation Vol. 2 is. Every good thing said about this CD is true, it's fantastic. I was a skeptic but was so struck by Don't Bother that I did decide to get it. A lot of CDs nowadays take a few listens to really start to appreciate what you're given, but with Oral Fixation Vol. 2 it only takes one listen and you know that you just listened to one of the finest pop albums of the year. Personally, I can't find a track I don't like, each one is exactly what it should be. This is the CD Laundry Service should've been. I know Shakira fans believe that CD was really good but I thought Shakira's voice was the only thing that really set it apart from the rest. But with Vol. 2, Shakira sets a new standard for this genre.<br /><br />How Do You Do is a nice introduction with a hip hop-esque beat in the verses yet changes to rock in the choruses. I haven't seen that done in a lot of music so I'm a fan of it and that scores points with me. It helps that it's an insanely catchy song though. Don't Bother earns it's spot as the lead single. I don't really know how to explain the feel of the song but the chorus is very catchy in the sense that you feel like you've heard it before. Illegal is a lot slower than I expected seeing as how Carlos Santana is featured on guitar. A lot of his songs are upbeat so, naturally, I figured Illegal would follow in the same vein but no, it's got almost a lounge feel to it. The Day And The Time is another slow song but in no way sounds like Illegal. It does have a catchy little 80s type hook to it so that's a nice touch. Animal City is destined to become one of the best songs featured. Animal City moves away from the slow ballad-like songs and is a real toe-tapper complete with Spanish horns. The chorus is very original and memorable and will no doubt get stuck in your head. If I were forced to pick a low point on this CD I'd pick Dreams For Plans, but that's only if I was forced. It's got all the ingredients for a wonderful song, but somehow falls short. Even when Shakira isn't at the top of her game she's still considerably better than any other pop singer though. Hey You is a nice happy go lucky track that deserves a listen. Your Embrace is a gorgeous ballad. It's basically just a song to a lover, as any ballad is. Costume Makes The Clown picks up the pace in a huge way with extremely spiteful lyrics and nice use of guitars. Costume.. is a personal favorite, though I'm sure there's a lot of people who are sure to disagree. Something is another slow song that features good lyrics and lush melodies, so no complaints there. I'm glad Shakira rounded out this CD with the upbeat Timor. It makes great use of sound effects, 80s-esque beats, and even a choir. There's no song I could think of that could close this CD better.<br /><br />My favorite songs Oral Fixation Vol. 2 have to offer are How Do You Do, Don't Bother, Illegal, Animal City, and Costume Makes The Clown. Whether you're lured in by the sexy cover shot or simply by Shakira's music, you're bound to find a few things you like about this CD. If you were let down by past releases of Shakira's yet saw potential, what you'll hear on this CD is Shakira grasping that potential and wringing out every possible drop of good music.I were forced to pick a low point on this CD I'd pick Dreams For Plans, but that's only if I was forced.

B000001OAA|5.0|If you're looking for room thumping, full frontal rock n' roll, listen up. This is a club band but also more. Beyond the pounding, full-bodied sound is the writing, and it is good, very good. Together, the music and the lyrics in GARBAGE \\"G\\" give a spectrum portrait of raw emotion.<br /><br />G begins with the dominatrix in SUPERVIXEN, \\"I will be your religion\\". We have her erotic promise, \\"I'll feed your obsessions\\". The audio dropouts are the tease and denial. If vocalist Shirley Manson doesn't own you on this first track then try to resist her in QUEER with its sensual invitation to \\"...take a look at me, let me dirty-up your mind\\". There are surprises throughout this CD. ONLY HAPPY WHEN IT RAINS is a signature song. It is ironically upbeat. Manson is \\"riding high upon a deep depression\\". And we love her enthusiasm!<br /><br />AS HEAVEN IS WIDE is an extended curse and very scary. The venom from betrayal is undiluted, \\"Choke on guilt that's far too good for you\\". In NOT MY IDEA her patience - \\"I bit my tongue and stood in line\\" - turns to bitterness. She is vengeful in VOW, \\"You burned me but I'm back at your door. Like Joan of Arc coming back for more\\". The anger may be self-directed in STUPID GIRL, \\"A million lies to sell yourself is all you ever had\\". It's another signature track. Regret surfaces in DOG NEW TRICKS, \\"Sometimes didn't say what I meant to say\\". And desperation in MY LOVER'S BOX, \\"Send me an angel to love...I'm afraid I'll never get to heaven\\". FIX ME NOW is an urgent plea. The tone has certainly changed from the early tracks. Again in A STROKE OF LUCK and the plaintive final track, MILK, we see her vulnerability and longing, \\"I am lost...but I'd be love and sweetness if I had you\\".<br /><br />The CD jacket has a sampling of the lyrics. I'd like to have seen them printed in their entirety. As it is now you will need to mine the gems with the replay button. On reflection...not a bad thing.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is what movie-making is supposed to be about.  Characters you love and can relate to, a deep, engaging story, plot twists, thrills and chills, humor at all the right places.  This is the best movie that's been made in the last 10 years.  Too bad most folk don't get sci-fi.

0446677450|1.0|i cant believe this is a best seller. what a bomb.  absolutley no substance on how to do anything just catch phrases. he advocates insider selling, desertion, and believes killing an unarmed boy in his helicopter is his sworn duty. im sickened that i bought this book. do your own research on this guy, need i say amway?  also trashes his own dad and makes up this \\"rich dad\\", is divorced, no kids, and brags about his porche, rolex, and $400 golf clubs.  its my guess that the source of his fortunes is from the sales of his books on how to get rich.  ridiculous? you bet but dont say i didnt warn you. utter garbage.  no substance.
B000062YAZ|5.0|What can I say? This is the most influencial thrash album ever. The possibly the best metal album as well. Heck, might as well be the best album ever made period. No ifs ands or buts, this is one good album.  <br />First off, we have \\"Angel of Death\\" this song is a personal favorite of mine. Pure musical and lyrical genius right here. 15/10 <br />Piece by Piece - Nice solo, a bit short though 9/10 <br />Necrophobic - Awesome lyrics and vulgar at that 9/10 <br />Altar of Sacrifice - These are the lyrics that Slayer is about! 10/10 <br />Jesus Saves - JESUS SAVES! 10/10 <br />Crimminally Insane - A bit slow for Slayer but some good lyrics 9/10 <br />Reborn - Starts out awesome but weekens 8/10  <br />Epidemic - AWESOME drum solo 8/10 <br />Postmortem - Pretty sweet song 9/10 <br />Raining Blood - Most people know this Slayer song and it still is awesome although it is a bit overrated 13/10 <br />Aggressive Perfector - Nice closer to a really good album 10/10 <br />110/110 A+ <br />This is THE defining moment in metal and thrash. If you do not have this CD, you need to get it ASAP and get enlightened!
B0000009S3|5.0|i started with the CD version from ryko. i liked it a lot. then, in a massive vinyl score, i discovered a first pressing of this vinyl, popped it on, and was blown away! the whole thing is different! i really like the vinyl version of \\"willie the pimp\\" even with frank's SG fading in and out while the captain is still \\"spinging\\" (that i think, is speaking and singing) <br /> <br />ok no more digression. peaches en regalia, as many have said, is quite catchy. i always imagined the sitcom based on my life would feature peaches as my opening tune. then again i was 10 when i made that decision, so what can i say? i saw a betamax copy of \\"peaches\\" as performed on SNL in '76 i think, and it was one of the songs that got me exploring zappa. again and again i try to whistle it complete, but fail. need to tone up those buccinators. <br /> <br />i love willie the pimp. captain beefheart is a madman with a four-and-a-half octave vocal range. what a blast listening to this song is, it has a gritty, dirty edge to it, punctuated by frank's screaming SG weaving in and out like a drunk through traffic. it seems that the audio mix featured every tweak available at the time, 16 tracks, flangers, phasers, the LP version runs the gamut as far as classic audio manipulation is concerned. frank was borderline obsessive in the studio, and it shows, even after 35 years, this vinyl sounds better than most DDA or DDD recordings made today.  <br />son of mr. green genes is somehow about lumpy branham, the guy who played mr. green jeans on \\"captain kangaroo\\". this track is a monstrous instrumental, and was a staple of the mother's performance before it was recorded. i heard frank describe it at a show in paris in 1968. he said some pretty awful things about mr. green jeans, and then relates it to american mothers and fathers' ineptitude in the job and home. awwww, frank! i think he knew full well what all this 60's counterculture was breeding. a bunch of baby boomin', reagan era, overpriveleged,flashback having ex hippies. ha!  <br /> <br />this whole album stands out as the rosetta stone of zappa recordings. minimal, yet full with sound, simple, yet replete with nuance. classic rock as a whole took some valuable cues from mr. zappa. i insist that those interested in straightforward rock music that will kick your arse and curl your toes and have you giddy, sitting in the sweet spot in front of the hifi watching a blessed piece of vinyl spin 'round, should check this out! give one to your child, your brother, your cousin, play it for gramma, rock it in the car, tell your friends. <br /> <br />viva la zappa!
B000BYA5GO|5.0|I can't wait to get this movie on DVD. It appealed to every emotion in me, great!!!
B0002OERI0|1.0|I honestly can't believe you people allow such garbage to be allowed. Overplayed, overrated, and overhyped, American Idiot is the kind of rock that killed the genre. Remember metal? Hard Rock? Psychadelic Rock? Grunge? or even Punk(which by the way i hate but it beats the hell outta this)? they're all gone. dead. never to return because of stupid trash like this. Every song on here is annoying. The singer sounds like he just swallowed ten bottles of liquid estrogen. and my grandma could play better guitar. a lot of people say that Green Day's older stuff was better well have i got some news for you. Green Day always sucked. Always have and after this, always will. What ever happened to guitar solos. as i recall they were an important factor in making a song meaningful. gone are those days. i just hope music starts to get better, cuz it's been spiraling downwards since '94. Go pick up a Led Zeppelin or AC/DC album. or get a Pearl Jam or Alice in Chains album if you don't care for classic rock as much. oh and one more thing. if Zeppelin and AC/DC are classic rock, then what're we gonna call Green Day and Fall Out Boy in 20 years. i know what i'm gonna call em. Garbage.
B0002858YS|2.0|\\"Smile Like You Mean It,\\" \\"Mr. Brightside,\\" and \\"Somebody Told Me\\" are the best songs - but you've probably already heard at least two of these on the radio lots of times.  \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\\" and \\"Andy You're a Star\\" are OK - they're listenable tracks.  Most of the rest is unlistenable filler - most of it after track 6 of the album.  Just because radio seized on the few best tracks on the album doesn't mean that the album is good as a whole, and all the songs generally sound the same.    Overall, as the reviewer whose headline reads \\"What's The Hot Fuss About?\\" said, as well as several others: as a whole this stuff is very average, mediocre even.  It certainly is not innovative; it's the opposite.  Not recommended.
B0001XAPZ6|1.0|OK, I know a lot of self loathing environmentalist love this film. Humans are evil, humans are bad and untrustworthy, animals are inherently good and superior to human beings and therefore animals should have dominion over our precious god, mother earth. That's the theme of this film. Watching this film makes you want to die, literally. After all, the earth would be so much better off if we humans weren't around mucking it up.<br /><br />I am quite sure that the self loathing creator and the self loathing lovers of this film had no issue with using the DVD player to view this film, which by the way is powered by electricity which was made possible by burning eeeeevil fossil fuels. I wonder if the creator ever rode in an earth polluting automobile or airplane and yet has no problem telling us how eeeeevil and stupid we human beings are?<br /><br />If I could give this film negative 100 stars, I would. The worst film I have ever seen in my life.
0553801503|1.0|This book goes nowhere slowly.  We know where the characters left off at the end of book 3 and by the end of this book it feels as if nothing happened.  There is the usual character death, political intrigue and general plot movement, but when the last page turns you have to ask 'How are things different now than when I started' and the answer is 'not very different'.
1582432678|5.0|This book has to be one of the most gripping and thought-provoking, uncomfortable novels I have read in a long time. It works on so many levels.  The characters are superbly drawn. Kevin himself is a monstrous, hideous, damaged creation. Eva at times irritating, cold, vain, self-obsessed, her ethnicity and sense of victimhood wonderfully countered by Franklin's no less annoying stolid, phelgmatic \\"all-American dad\\" personality. Much has been said about the book's approach to the shibboleths of loving your children, the glories of motherhood, teen violence etc. And the book is fantastic at exploring these issues. A deeper vein runs through this book though, the letters set against the end of the Clinton presidency and the Bush-Gore fiasco: that is what sort of society America is breeding in its affluence and homogenization. As one reviewer calls it \\"Desperate Housewives as written by Euripides\\".
B000069HKH|5.0|I wasn't aware that this CD had anything to do with 9/11 when I purchased it. My daughter brought it home from school and it just sounded great, so I bought my own copy.  Admittedly, I have never been a die-hard fan of Springsteen's music (sorry). But, I have changed my mind based on this musical masterpiece.  One cannot help being impressed with its depth of vitality and energy.    That being said - this is one of the most amazing and enjoyable CD's I own.  I love the variations in the tempos, the stories, the lyrics, and on and on. Great roadtrip music and several of the songs have been transferred to my walking tapes. This is one of those CD's that should be in everyone's collection.
B000BP86OG|5.0|I loved Permission to Land and was anticipating this release for a long time. This album did not dissapoint. It rocks!!

B00028HBKM|5.0|Mel Gibson's film is as beautiful and startling as a Caravagio painting... and mind you, it's hard to call a film full of grotesque violence as \\"beautiful.\\"<br /><br />It's Passion depiction is cruel and frightening... as it SHOULD be. No more comfortable crucifixion movie scenes... thank God.<br /><br />The flogging depicted was probably worse than what really happened. As a Shroud of Turin believer, I believe that Jesus was horribly flogged by a flagrum that featured dumb-bell shaped pellets of wood or bone... not a flagrum with sharp metal blades. Christ's entire body was blistered and bleeding, but probably not shredded as it was in this film. It would be hard to believe that anyone would be able to bear a cross... or even WALK... after what this film shows as the scourging.<br /><br />As an artistic depiction, however, the overdone scourging depicts how it must had felt for our savior... the agony.<br /><br />As for whether the film is anti-semitic or not, simply read the account written by the Roman- Jewish historian, Josephus. Josephus writes of a Jewish prophet that came after Christ, who preached the downfall of the Temple. The SANHEDRIN arrested him, and turned him over to the Roman Governor. He was scourged by the Roman Governor and set free... and the angry Sanhedrin wasn't very pleased. A stealth assassin ended up killing this prophet of doom with a stone.<br /><br />Thus, Josephus confirms that the Jewish government of that generation  would turn a fellow Jew over to the gentiles, if such a brethern dared to oppose them in any way.<br /><br />As the final closer to this controversy, Jesus said that \\"no man\\" could take his life... only he could lie it down for us. Thus, the \\"Jews\\" didn't kill Jesus... the \\"Romans\\" didn't kill Jesus... JESUS willingly died for our sake.<br /><br />Mel humanizes the Lord in a special way... and the scenes between Christ and his mother are especially stirring. Watch this movie!<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of \\"the Shroud of Torrington.\\"author of \\"the Shroud of Torrington.\\"
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I was driving down the highway when I first heard \\"Welcome to Jamrock\\". I stopped my car in mid-traffic and said to myself (who is that-d_m?)  The DJ from the radio station informed me that it was Damian Marley's new joint. Welcome to Jamrock left me spellbound. A must have if you enjoy reggae.
B0000B3B95|3.0|Ang Lee directed this film as if he was impressed with himself, impressed with his split screens and editing, impressed with his \\"artistry.\\" In this blender of pretention, the Hulk I grew up on manages to peak through.<br /><br />Okay, we do have to creep through scenes of heavy handed angst and repression.<br /><br />Still, once the Hulk breaks out of his clothes, the fun begins!<br /><br />The CGI Hulk is at times totally convincing, at other times plastic looking. Too bad the effects wizards weren't more consistent.<br /><br />There are still plenty of great effects, many \\"Hulk Smash\\" scenes, and the soundtrack is incredible!!<br /><br />The concluding battle is too brief,  but at least this movie has more \\"jaw dropping\\" moments than the average super-hero film.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, the author of \\"the Shroud of Torrington.\\"
B0006284JQ|5.0|This is the best album. Shes came along way from Baby One More Time. She deserves the title Queen Of Pop. Most you hear is \\"She sells sex\\"(most of which insecure kids writing)and \\"Not sutible for children\\" blah blah blah, everyone who sayed that has most likely never even lisen to a single song. If you dont want your kids to listen, dont let them. Dont come hear and complain. Her music is enjoyable. Its fun to listen to, She has a beautiful voice. I love her and her music.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I'll try not to repeat the obvious, the other reviewers have covered much of what makes this film an epic.<br /><br />Here are some observations that are often over-looked.<br /><br />The soundtrack is INCREDIBLE!! The sweeping, stirring soundtrack capture the mood of this story perfectly.<br /><br />A story with an INTELLECTUAL protagonist is soooo refreshing! A hero that THINKS his way through crisis and danger, rather than the typical kick butt in most movies.<br /><br />The way this movie misleads and surprises the viewer is tremendous. At the end, every single little detail and loose end is tied up... no inconsistencies can be found.<br /><br />A man experiences a private Hell, but his spirit remains strong. This movie is the \\"Rocky\\" of the 90s...  and it WILL inspire all viewers to lead a better life!!<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel \\"The Shroud of Torrington.\\"
1594200696|3.0|The illustrations are wonderful, as are the font and graphic design.  The paper on which the book is printed also seems to be fairly high quality, bright and heavy to the touch, and looks to be acid-free.  HOWEVER, the cloth binding is execrable.  My copy is brand new, yet the front and back covers are already warping, and the text block itself is noticeably curved and starting to warp.  The garish, cheap red cloth cover is poorly embossed;  the title and spine lettering looks painted on with white-out and a cardboard stencil.  I suspect that it will probably flake off in a matter of months.  It's bewildering to me that the Penguin Press would lavish so much attention on the text block, then skimp on the binding, for an edition whose principle allure is as an objet d'art.
B000AADYYO|5.0|With the release of Ghost Reveries, I'm ready to make it official: Opeth have sold their souls.  That is the only explanation I can come up with for how they so regularly churn out such astounding music.  It would take most bands an entire career to pull off an album half as bold, complex and ambitious as any of the 8 albums Opeth has given us in the last decade.  They have never failed to raise the bar for themselves and metal as a whole.  Now they give us Ghost Reveries, one of their most ambitious offerings yet.  Although, in this highly commercialized age, it is hard to see Opeth reaching the same sort of pantheon status, I would not hesitate to put them in the same room as Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath in terms of what they have done with music.  Here's the track by track:    Ghost of Perdition: Brace yourself, that's the best advice I can give for the first time you hear this song. Do not let those first 8 seconds fool you, because that is all the time they give you to say goodbye to your face before they rip it off.  The first minute of this song is downright brutal.  Another thing you should make note of in this song is Mikael's clean singing, which he uses in new, more interesting ways than he has previously.  It makes appearences in the heavier sections where, normally, he would be growling, and sounds more sinister than it ever has.  At once familiar and entirely new, this is one of the best opening tracks i've ever heard.    The Baying of the Hounds:  Some have compared moments on this song to Deep Purple, I don't know if I'd go that far, but it does have a bit of a swagger to it that I've never from Opeth heard before.  The opening riff is probably my favorite on this album, and the clean vocal part at around 2 minutes is very interesting.  It almost sounds....happy.  Like I said, Mikael's clean singing on this album is being taken in all sorts of new directions.  Watch out for the riff around 6:20 when the heaviness kicks back in, it may cause you to kill someone.    Beneath the Mire:  The intro is definately something new, key boardist Per Wiberg is most prominently on display here and took awhile to grow on me, now I love it.  It is very groove oriented and an interesting new direction for the band.  The solo around 3:30 is a classic.  Now, this may come off as a bold statement, but I think this song may be Mikael's best vocal performance ever.  His growls are horrifying and vicious on a level he's never quite reached before.  His clean vocals go through several different, amazing sections that all but carry the song.  A lot of people didn't like the way this song ended, but I thought it was really cool and yet another unexpected twist in this frequently surprising song.    Atonement:  The weakest track on the album, in my opinion.  It gets points for being a true original in the Opeth catalog.  It's very psychedelic and experimental, reminiscent of something The Beatles might've done.  That said, it never really goes anywhere and doesn't hold my interest.    Reverie/Harlequin Forest:  Whoa, this track is a f***ing monster.  The opening two verses mark the most pronounced change in the way Akerfeldt uses his clean singing.  The death metal vocals are used more or less as an interlude and for the finale.  Mikael and Lindgren's guitar work on this track is unforgettable.  The ending could have been a little better, it comes off as a more lumbering version of the ending of Deliverance, really a minor complaint when the rest of the song is so stellar.    Hours of Wealth: My favorite light track on this CD, I'm finding it's too often overlooked.  The intro is absolutely gorgeous, it's borderline hypnotic.  Once again, though, Akerfeldt's vocals steal the show.  Almost completely unaccompanied except for a few well-timed keyboard strokes from Wiberg, the emotion in this very stripped down performance is undeniable.  Of all the tracks, this is the one on the album the stuck in my mind immediately.    The Grand Conjuration: Ah, here we are, the contriversial single.  I will admit I was a bit concerned when I heard the cut down version of the song, however, it grew on me and the unedited version blew me away.  Probably the simplest of Opeth's trademark epic tracks, it sticks to the same basic structure and riff throughout.  Careful with this thing, it doesn't let up once in its entire 10 minutes.  Even the lighter sounding sections simmer with tension, making sure you know what's coming.  The solo following the second chorus is awesome.    Isolation Years: Very intersting, Opeth usually choose something a bit more climactic to finish off their albums.  That said, this is a nice little epilogue to all the chaos we've just been through.  It's a short, simple, soothing song that will not immediately grab your attention, but you should make sure not to ignore.    Bottom Line: Opeth should not be thanking Roadrunner for getting them decent distribution (FINALLY), Roadrunner should be thanking Opeth for adding such an amazing piece of work to their library.

B000BB1MHS|3.0|I've read the Roald Dahl classic book several times, and I've seen the original 1971 musical version Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (by director Mel Stuart and starring Gene Wilder) too many times to count.<br /><br />I enjoyed the 2005 \\"Charlie & The Chocolate Factory\\" (especially all the clever special effects) and am glad I rented it. I enjoy Johnny Depp in any role, and I think Freddie Highmore (Charlie) is a loveable and promising young actor. However, I must admit that overall, there were more things I preferred about the 1971 \\"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.\\" Here's the list:<br /><br />First -- where's the lickable wallpaper?! It's a minor detail, but I really missed it in the '05 version. During the factory tour in the 1971 version, one of the places Wonka takes the kids is to a wall covered in small, colorful pictures of fruit (and maybe other things). He invites them to lick the pictures and taste the different fruits. They do, and are amazed.So was I! In fact, I was so obsessed with lickable wallpaper I even daydreamed about it! (Of course, I didn't think of how unsanitary it would be!) I also remember wanting to take the scratch-and-sniff sticker concept and turn it into scratch-and-lick.<br /><br />In the '05 version, there were too many subtle similarities between Wonka and Michael Jackson for my liking, from the pasty face to the glove-wearing to the weird mannerisms. I also thought Wonka was too unfriendly/cold toward his visitors. I know he's an eccentric hermit who probably has little trust in people, but I think he should have more of the whimsical, free-spirited, almost silly quality Gene Wilder brought to the role. This is not a criticism of Depp; I think he was an excellent actor in this role. I just prefer Wilder's Wonka over Depp's.<br /><br />In '05, we only hear of Slugworth (Wonka's evil competitor) as someone who used a spy-stolen recipe to make a Wonka-esque candy for his own candy store. We don't really \\"meet\\" him or learn his personality. That's not true in '71, probably because in '71 there's an important scene toward the end that mentions Slugworth.<br /><br />In '05 version, Grandpa Joe's transformation from bed-ridden old man to Charlie's tour chaperone just doesn't have the emotional quality as it did in '71. In '05, he simply gets out of the bed and does a little victory jig. No one seems shocked that he's walking, so neither does the viewer. In '71, the entire family -- not to mention Grandpa Joe himself -- seem totally agog. And his victory jig is a lot more joyful and engaging.<br /><br />In '05, Veruca Salt was not nearly as petulant, nagging, loud and bratty as her '71 counterpart. Supposedly the epitome of the selfish, spoiled rich snot, her '05 personality is a bit too toned-down, sometimes even eclipsed by Violet Beauregarde. Additionally, in '05, Veruca's father seems resigned and exasperated with his daughter's behavior, not intimidated. This is a contrast to '71, where Veruca's father seemed almost like her slave, frantically kowtowing to her every whim and very intimidated by her.<br /><br />In '05, Violet Beauregarde is an ultra-competitive, conceited, self-centered brat who'd be just as hateful as Veruca except for the fact that Violet doesn't demand that she wants everything. I prefer the '71 Violet, who is an annoying, fast-talking, nose-picking know-it-all, but not anywhere NEAR as hateful as Veruca.<br /><br />Augustus Gloop hasn't changed much between the two movie versions, so I don't have much to say about him. Mike Teevee is portrayed as too violent in the '05 version (probably because we didn't have Nintendo and X-Box games in the '70s!), but aside from that, I don't have any strong feelings either way about the changes in his character.<br /><br />In '05, I thought it was rather silly that all the Oompa Loompas working in the factory are identical. It's like \\"Attack of the Clones\\"! (LOL) If indeed the Oompa Loompas were a pygmy-like tribe living in the jungle and worshipping the cocoa (cacao) bean, they should all look similar but not identical! I dunno. I just thought it was kind of disappointing.<br /><br />How come in '05 the children are SHOWN an everlasting gobstopper, but don't each receive one like they do in '71? Those fascinated me almost as much as the lickable wallpaper. And the gobstopper was also crucial to a later plot twist (see below).<br /><br />I really missed how in '05 the \\"Fizzy Lifting Drink\\" scene was left out. That's where Charlie and Grandpa Joe drink the bubbly stuff and end up in a glass tank (I forgot how) where they almost float up to the fan blades and get killed, and have to \\"burp\\" their way down to escape. I liked it because it showed that EVEN Charlie sometimes lets his curiosity get the better of him, and gets in trouble for it!<br /><br />Because of the Fizzy Lifting incident (in '71), Wonka yells at Charlie and Grandpa Joe about that incident and tells them that basically, it was all over and they'd get nothing. If you recall, after this argument, Grandpa Joe tells Wonka off and then tells Charlie \\"If Slugworth wants a gobstopper, he'll get one!!\\" This is in reference to Wonka's evil competitor, Slugworth, whom we already met early in the movie and who offered Charlie a bribe for the gobstopper recipe.<br /><br />Of course, Charlie remains noble and honest in the face of all his hurt and disappointment, and hands Wonka back the gobstopper after all. This, of course, is what Wonka had been hoping for, and says the moving but not well-remembered line: \\"And so shines a good deed in a weary world.\\" He soon bursts into gleeful hysterics and gives Charlie the good news that it was all a test of character and that Charlie is the new heir to the chocolate factory. I was disappointed none of this played out in '05.<br /><br />The one thing about the '05 version I definitely liked BETTER than '71 was that it was true to the Nut-Sorting Room mentioned in Roald Dahl's book. This is where Veruca Salt meets her end (well, not her death, but her end of the tour). In '71, it was not a room full of squirrels sorting nuts but instead something to do with chickens sitting on nests and laying eggs. (I admittedly can't recall the exact situation). In '05, it's back to nut-sorting and I almost flipped when I saw all those cute, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed squirrels sitting on little stools and grabbing, cracking and tossing nuts! (I love rodents.)<br /><br />Thanks for reading my rambling rant. *blush* This is a shorter version (SHORTER, can you believe that?) from the review I wrote in my blog.ribe living in the jungle and worshipping the cocoa (cacao) bean, they should all look similar but not identical!

B000006045|4.0|This album should be an instant classic.  This beautiful gem was crafted with one discerning eye scanning for even the most insignificant of flaws.  There are truly none to be found.  The reason this isn't one of my favorite albums of all time is explained in a story I probably should not tell.  I will tell it anyway.  When I purchased this in the spring of 2001, the Philadelphia 76ers were about to square off against the L.A. Lakers in the NBA Finals.  Now into more important affairs. The Israeli public was reluctantly dragged into a \\"new\\" intifada against Palestinian militant terrorists.  It seemed as though every other day a homicide bomber was executing a heinous plot to destroy some more innocent citizens of Israel. Another C-4 packing scumbag toting a bag of nuts and nails explodes in a school bus full of elementary school kids. Tis is jilted moral reasoning, even the most naive of Arafat's western fan club must understand this.  For whatever reason this CD reminds me of the countless, senseless casualties sustained on both sides engaged in that asinine capsule of human history.  I wish this great music didn't bring those feelings to the surface, but it does.  Like Pavlov's dogs, I have been classically conditioned to it.  Still, this is good music for the rest of you.  Fetch Ubu.
B0009K7RES|4.0|If you liked the Shangri-La album, this is a must buy.  I think a lot of other reviewers have expounded more than I'm going to, but the tracks are much more alive here.  My favorite tracks from here are Rudiger and Song for Sonny Liston.  Everybody Pays is great here as well.  Several songs here were not performed live on his last tour, so tis great to get to hear them in a live setting.  Back to Tupelo and Stand up guy were not played at my concert, and likely weren't played elsewhere.  Even if there is a live album, the quality of sound here should top it.  Only 8 songs...but each one is flawless, and provides many more details and subtleties than the original album recordings.
B0000DD7LC|3.0|Had Alicia released the Diary like this it would have been a classic: <br />Intro- great intro to the album <br />Karma- love the music and lyrics <br />Heartburn - reminds me of 70's funk <br />If I was your woman - excellent cover <br />You don't know my name - great mix of vocals, music, and samples <br />If I ain't got you - beautiful <br />Diary- great song <br />Nobody not really- excellent album closer <br /> The Diary shouldve been an 8 song EP and it wouldve been a classic soul album. Tracks 8-14 just cant sustain the album.
B000BGH22W|5.0|I initially bought this soundtrack album for a number of reasons: <br />1 - I own the first 3, so, for the sake of a complete collection, the 4th was a must. <br />2 - I enjoyed \\"the music during the arrival of the Durmstrang lot, and at the beginning of the 3rd task\\" (btw, being \\"The Quidditch World Cup\\" and \\"Hogwarts' March\\") <br />3 - I'm a Harry Potter obsessive, so I just had to get it. <br /> <br />Once I bought this album, I slapped it into my computer to give my verdict. <br /> <br />The official soundtrack items on the disk (the first 21 tracks) are very well conducted, suiting the mood of the movie.  However, despite the fact that I still love \\"The Quidditch World Cup\\" and \\"Hogwarts' March\\" with the addition of \\"Underwater Secrets\\", \\"Potter Waltz\\", \\"Rita Skeeter\\" and \\"The Story Continues\\", I do very much prefer John Williams' music on the whole; it being slightly more magical (which, of course, is a necessity when it comes to the soundtrack of a \\"Harry Potter\\" movie). <br />I would liken this part of the soundtrack to that of \\"The Mummy\\" and the ITV News.  --x-- I was over-the-moon to discover that \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" from the previous movies (yes, the official \\"Harry Potter Theme\\") appears in more than one track on \\"Goblet of Fire\\" (2, for those who didn't notice). <br /> <br />However, that being the case, I still very much enjoy the album and would recommend it to everyone. <br /> <br /> <br />I simply cannot review this soundtrack album without mentioning the final 3 tracks, by the Weird Sisters.  As this music is very much to my taste anyhow, I fell in love with it immediately.  \\"Do The Hippogriff\\" is a track to which one can go crazy to, turn up loud and act the Fool!  \\"This Is The Night\\" is just as good, though nowhere near as humourous.  And as for \\"Magic Works\\", I would certainly use this as the final track to any dance - it's perfect ... and I noticed that the lyrics interlink with the love/hate relationship between Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.<br /> <br /> <br />A cracking soundtrack, despite the obvious downsides.  Big up to Patrick Doyle! o_O

B000BW7QWW|5.0|You've heard all the rave reviews, and based on the box office returns you still ignored this brilliant film.  Shame on you.  Go watch another episode of \\"Beauty and the Geek\\".  Seriously,  if you haven't seen \\"Serenity\\" yet just skip the rental and buy the DVD, you will be watching it repeatedly wondering why you didn't check it out sooner.  It is enjoyable for anyone regardless of whether you have seen an episode of the tv series.  Now in regards to the title of this review, the cover art for the DVD stinks!!!  Who is that amazonian woman on the cover?!?  It is surely not River.  I assume Univeral is trying to draw more attention to the release with the flashy art, but the original movie poster art was far superior.  I have an official lobby poster from the movie hanging in my house...apartment...alright, in my room...in my parents' basement.  Oh, well I guess I'll scan that picture to place over the stupid one in the DVD case.  Great Sci-Fi movies, yeah, studio marketing, boo.  Now go buy the movie.
0140135154|2.0|This book is basically Marxist view of art, and what art is intended to accomplish.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing!  It does help you to examine your assumptions and beliefs a bit, and that's one of the things an education is supposed to do.<br /><br />The book repeatedly hammers the idea that art serves the purposes of the ruling class.  This is beat upon to the point of tediousness.  There is also a chapter that can be summarized as \\"art serves the purposes of powerful men by trivializing women and encouraging them to think of themselves as an object d'art for the viewing pleasure of others.  Oddly enough, the book didn't really return to this them in the final essay when it talked about the visual image in advertising.  That's an arena where visual imagery is used to play on the insecurities of everyone, but especially women, to convince them that they are flawed and need __(fill in the name of a product)____ to be happy and respected and glamorous. Speaking of which, one of the more interesting points in the book (even though I believe it is flat wrong) is the discussion of the rise of \\"glamor\\" as a desirable trait.<br /><br />I found the book interesting, and it irritated me, but only in a good way--By making me think about my views.  But it really is written from the perspectives of a trendy liberal from the early 1970s.  Instead of closing with a powerful message summarizing some important aspect of art that we have been taught, the authors even use the final paragraph of the last essay to point out that capitalism exploits the masses and coerces them to ignore their own best interest(that's literally what it says!).<br /><br />Probably worth reading, but not a high priority.  The Penguin edition is compact and affordable, but the B&W images are so small that much of the value of the work is lost--You can't see details of the art being reproduced.
630289915X|3.0|We see the life of George Bailey. Working as a young clerk in a pharmacy, he tried to correct a mistake by the pharmacist, and is slapped around for this. [Could this happen to the son of a banker?] The pharmacist's son had died in the war (influenza!) and this distracted the pharmacist (drank too much?). Later George enters a dance contest, and some of them take an unintended bath [symbolizing the Crash and Depression]. George's college plans are halted by his father's illness [a symbol for hard times]. Another crisis follows the attempt by Banker Potter to appropriate the Building & Loan Society [which provides loans to working people so they could move from the cold water tenements owned by Potter]. But the Board decides to continue with George Bailey as Executive Secretary. George's younger brother goes to college, marries an heiress, and moves away. There is one scene where Uncle Billy has overdone his celebrating [nepotism is always a problem]. <br /> <br />Mary gets a call from Sam while George is there. They learn of a stock offer in plastics - \\"the deal of a lifetime\\". People in Bedford Falls are out of work since the factory closed down. Later George and Mary are married on a rainy day, but are interrupted by a run on their bank [no FDIC in those days]. George takes charge and saves the business from the schemes of Potter. George's speech explains the economics of banking to the audience: they will be all right if they just stick together. One sunny day shows a family (with a goat!) moving to a new housing tract [as occurred in the 1920s]. This was possible after local farming closed down. This affects the rent profits of Banker Potter, whose tenements are losing renters. [They hadn't yet figured out to fill them up with Welfare clients.] <br /> <br />Potter makes a generous offer to buy George. He refuses, and shows he could learn some diplomacy and tact. Trouble occurs when Uncle Billy loses the cash he was supposed to deposit! [Pride goes before a fall.] Potter finds it and keeps it. [Did you expect him to be honest?] This was a management failure on George Bailey's part - sending out a boy on a man's job. George's request for help from Potter is soundly rejected. And so Angel Clarence intervenes. What would happen if George Bailey was never born? [This reminded me of \\"A Christmas Carol\\".] At the end the people come up with the cash to meet the bank's needs. And so the story has a happy ending. [Can you believe this?] Bedford Falls doesn't wind up as Pottersville. <br /> <br />In real life Banker Potter would have to turn any found money over to the police. Potter has also broken Banking Laws by taking depositor's money without any accounting or receipt. If his servant talked, Potter would spend the rest of his life in jail. Some have noticed the absence of religious persons in this film; what does that say? No mention of other members of the ruling families in this town. I always thought this film had a subtle anti-alcohol message. [The names and settings suggest upstate New York.] <br />
0553801503|3.0|I don't want to bash this book too badly, because it was very interesting. I really loved the first three books, and was one of the many who waited and waited. That said, I agree with those who say that it was too long for so little to happen. Sure, it's only half the story, blah blah, but it was still too much minutia. I loved the minutia in the earlier books, but this book needed more tweaking to take it from tedium to fascination.  <br />If a 1000-page book -- two years overdue -- is something that can be a rushed job, then this is it. That said, I'm still interested, and must follow this \\"trilogy\\" to its \\"conclusion\\". Just don't take my determination to read all the books as  an opportunity to rest on your laurels, Mr. Martin!
B000007XUQ|5.0|\\"Christmas music is timeless and universal - just as the Carpenters' music has proved to be. Both appeal, to borrow a line from one of the best Christmas songs ever written, \\"to kids from one to 92.\\"  ~ Paul Grein, Liner Notes, 1998 ~<br /><br />It's always been a delight listening to this double CD filled with all-time Christmas favorites as interpreted by the talented brother-sister-team of Richard and Karen Carpenter. Up until early this year, I came to a  notion that Christmas music is not at all seasonal and I could listen to it all-year-round if I feel like it and enjoy it as much as I listen during Christmas Season.<br /><br />This set consists of the Carpenters two Christmas albums \\"Christmas Portrait\\" (1978) and \\"An Old-Fashioned Christmas\\" (1984) and features a combination of sacred as well as secular Christmas carols that evoke joy, enthusiasm and varied emotions and sentiments to the listeners. The Carpenters along with Billy May, Peter Knight, the rest of the creative musicians and the Chorale groups did an excellent job in these recordings.<br /><br />It's hard to pick out favorites from these Christmas carols since all are so beautifully performed. I loved them all and they're my all-time favorites. But my very highlights include \\"O Holy Night\\" - a contemplative and heavenly instrumental version so magnificently performed by Richard Carpenter on piano with the Chorale group and arranged by Peter Knight. Mr. Carpenter is such a great pianist/arranger/singer all rolled into one. Listening to this piece brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />Ms. Carpenter's beautiful voice is showcased in an achingly poignant and wishful \\"Merry Christmas Darling.\\" You'll also love her gorgeous versions of \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,\\"  \\"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\\" and \\"What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?\\" - a very nice song composed by Frank Loesser with superb arrangements by Peter Knight. The Medleys and Overtures are fabulously rendered most notably \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,\\" \\"What Child Is This?\\" (Greensleeves), \\"O Come All Ye Faithful,\\" \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" and \\"Valse Des Fleurs.\\"<br /><br />I could go on and on but suffice it to say that this collection is the best-ever Christmas music of all-time. I merrily recommend it for your listening enjoyment all-year-round.<br /><br />May this Christmas Season bring more joy, peace, love and blessings to one and all!notably \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,\\" \\"What Child Is This?\\" (Greensleeves), \\"O Come All Ye Faithful,\\" \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" and \\"Valse Des Fleurs.\\"  <br /> <br />I could go on and on but suffice it to say that this collection is the best-ever Christmas music of all-time.

B00008L3U1|4.0|It's a cute family movie- Robin Williams is as good as you'd expect. His portrayal of a child is superb, and his parents, and friends are equally sincere and genuine. Bill Cosby is a nice addition to the story. One of Jennifer Lopez's first movies, and I thought she was good. OK, so it's based very loosely on the real disorder of kid's aging quickly, but it's a movie! It's still cute. I'd recommend it-
B000AMWIVM|1.0|(big time spoiler) This is one of those movies that you hear everybody calling it the best horror movie in the long time, but actually suck. This is one of those Blair Witch Project movies that you wait 1  or 2 hours for something to happen but at the end the whole movie goes down the drain. A guy cuts his arm off (and doesn't bleed to death). A very young girl is gagged and the camera insists on her cries and suffering (which is so wrong), and at the end the killer gets away (who by the way didn't have any reasons to do what he did). This movie is so DUMB I couldn't believe my eyes. If you are a horror fan like me, try: Hellraiser (all of them) the entire Nightmare on Elm Street collection, Jaws (1&2), the original Exorcist, the original The Fog, The Ring (1&2) and the Scream trilogy - stay away from SAW; or watch it to see how bad it sucks
B00004TJTS|5.0|This movie is so sweet! A genuine and heartfelt story about the bond between a boy and his dog. All the characters are sincere, and  real, and Skip, the dog, is just too cute for words! I could watch this movie over and over- it's just so good! (I love dogs!) <br />Too bad they don't make more movies like this.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|This is an amazing album, highly recommended. While listening to it you experience all kinds of emotions, and it doesn't hurt to understand the lyrics. I like Glosoli, Hoppi?polla and Heysatan the most at the moment, but the others are really good too. If you cant go to sleep or just want to relax, this is the music that soothes you in a heartbeat.
0739308742|2.0|After waiting impatiently for months, it has been disconcerting to discover this latest in what had been arguably the best read since Tolkien, did not even hold my attention.  I cannot work up much enthusiasm for any of the newly introduced characters, nor indeed, remember enough to distinguish them from anyone else.  Further, (for the audio book listener) the reader for this last book is certainly no match for the reader of the first three books.  Why can't the publishers have at least gotten the readers together so that the listener doesn't have to contend with a different pronounciation of almost every major character name?  It was too good to be true.  Did Mr. Martin have a junior author help out with this last, and least of a great series?  Please, take your vitamins, commune with the muse and do the magic once again.
B0000X2EOW|5.0|This movie was very beautifly done. The characters, the set,and the songs. I thought that it should have won an oscer, or emmy somthing like that because it was sooooo great. But the only thing is the gobblin king(david bowie) should have kissed the girl, oh crap what was her name, anyway because he sang two songs about how he loved her or about love,and he did't kiss her at the end!!! I'm soo mad at that, and even though he was evil he still should hhave KISSED HER.I mean you could clearly see that he loves her torwds the midddle of the end. Its so sad my brother doesn't agree with me. I mean a kiss at the end of a movie is what alwayys makes the movie good. The whole movie its self was amazing, but HE DIDN'T KISS HER. So if you dont mind no kiss or even if you do mind no kiss this is just a great movie to see. Its for parents and children.
0895260131|5.0|I'm not all the way through the book yet but what I have read so far fills in the blanks about \\"why\\" history has played out like it has.  More importantly, it provides the real answer of why we are in Iraq and Afganistan.  The culture and mind set of Islam described in this book is directly in line with the events that unfolded over the past 40 years or more and continue to happen. <br /> <br />I believe it when people tell me of their muslim friends or family who they say aren't \\"extreme\\" about their religion.  On the individual level muslims seem to be like everyone else in their respective cultures but when the religious mob mentality takes over, this is where the Islam we all know shows it's face.  The religion rules the individual when the religion exerts it's authority. <br /> <br />This book is a good tool, among many tools, to gain a clearer understanding of Islam, world events, cultural attitudes and why there is a group of people in a dire struggle to supress the truth about the danger in dealing with Islam.
B00005R24K|5.0|Horror movies today usually involve a big-breasted woman walking into the woods/a dark room/ another poorly-lit place and yelling \\"Hello?\\" and the name of the person they're looking for. The Evil Dead is no exception (well, Ellen Sandweiss isn't exactly big-breasted...), but the fact that walking into the woods and yelling loudly results in rape by tree is one of the many tricks up director Sam Raimi's sleeve.<br /><br />Most people say, \\"Oh, that movie with that guy with a chainsaw for a hand!\\" when Evil Dead is mentioned (real fans know Ash got the chainsaw hand in Evil Dead 2). Those people don't know what they're missing. The Evil Dead is a wild, insane goreride that launched Bruce Campbell to King of the B-Movies (and chins) and Sam Raimi to films like Spider-Man and its sequel (perhaps you've heard of them?). Not only is it scary, but it was made from a low budget, spawned one of the coolest franchises around, gave birth to the Coen brothers (well, they weren't actually born on set...) and their fame, and basically made the horror movie fresh again, even with well-known cliches.<br /><br />Lost? Fine, the basic plot: five college kids- Ash, his girlfriend Linda, sister Cheryl, best buddy Scott, and Scott's girlfriend Shelly head up to a remote mountain cabin in the woods and promptly find a strange book and tape recorder that has a professor named Knowby reciting passages from it. This raises evil spirits that possess them all until Ash is left to fend off the...wait for it...EVIL DEAD by himself. You getting chills yet? Well, then watch the damn movie!
B00005JOHI|4.0|I quote Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Last month my fiancee and I went to see the film, starring Keira Knightley and company.<br /><br />Any period piece film adaptation draws an inevitable comparison against its novel roots. I have to say that, for the most part, the film does well with its translation. I had been concerned with the casting of KK in the lead heroine role here, but she does a good job with the material, and the emotional range she conveys with her facial expressions rather caught my attention. The rest of the main cast are solid choices as well, and it is nice to see a fellow Canadian, Donald Sutherland, continuing to find work at his age! I was left wondering if Dame Judi's character was supposed to be so one-dimensional, as it has been a long time since I've read the book, but it's only a little nit, nothing more. Matthew MacFadyen, does an excellent job with Darcy, leading us to see a complex character from a distance, literally, as the characters' pride keeps the two main characters apart so often.<br /><br />My main complaint is with the ending. If the movie had ended with the novel's ending, it would have been perfect. The \\"Hollywood ending\\", with \\"the big kiss\\", sticks a dagger into the spirit of the times, and of the writing--romantic love was supposed to be implied, not shown. Not sure what the movie makers were thinking--did they think this would be a big box office draw? Ah well.<br /><br />I do recommend the movie though. It's well acted, and well produced, and shot in spectacular scenery. It's, uh, safe for kids, but they'd better be able to keep up with \\"fancy talking\\"!

B000A59PMO|5.0|Warning! Spoilers! <br /> <br />There was an adverteisment back in 2004 that talked about Veronica Mars it looked pretty interesting so when it first aired and i saw the pilot episode I was amazed. Every thought I had each Tuesday was how amazing will this episode be? The way each episode ended was so intriguing and it was so unforgettable. I enjoyed this show from the very begining. Part Dramatic, Thrilling, Mysterious, Scary, Violent, Disturbing, and at many times absolutely funny. I mean you can never stop watching this show once you watch any episode your hooked. There are guest appearences by Buffy The Vampire Slayers Alyson Hannigan which make this show funny and Angels Charisma Carpenter which makes the show very sexy. Season 1 ended with a shocker and it made you feel that Lilly Kanes soul may now rest in piece thanks to Veronica Mars. But the next season is a whole new mystery. I really really hope this show lasts for a long long time. There are so many possibilites with Veronica Mars and its amazing how a 25 year old can portray a young adventurous and average high school girl. There is some violence/disturbing images and some sexual dialouge but its still a great show. Teenagers will love it.
0333710924|5.0|It's surprising to me that this book is not better known here in the US; it's the quintessential picture book, and won several awards in Britain.  Compared to most of the insipid picture books out there today (i.e., the ones where you think to yourself, I COULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS), this book really sparkles.  It's fun to read aloud (i.e., it rhymes), has nice pictures (albeit not Caldecott material), an interesting and clever twist, and a moral: brains can beat brawn.  And unlike some of the fine picture books that appeal to me, as a parent, this one passes the most important test: it's beloved by my toddler too.  It's a constant choice for a bedtime story.  If there were a Caldecott for picture book text as well as illustrations (and there really ought to be!), this book would win hands down.  If you're looking for a great picture book (and one your child will remember into adulthood as a favorite), look no further.
0345451325|5.0|I already thought the Master Chief was the baddest ^&*%$ in the galaxy from the video game.  This book verified that not only is he, but he is also \\"human\\" and has a name. There are three things that I really, really, liked about this book. (1)I loved reading about the Spartans - who they are, how they were created, how their training went, and why they're so cool  (2)The fleet combat was some of the best that I ever read.  The game is first person shooter, but the book puts the game in perspective and lets us know \\"what the rest of the universe\\" is doing  (3)The book was fast-paced and kept my interest.  Once I picked it up, I spent the rest of the day reading until I finished it.    It is true that super-troopers with enhancements, advanced training, and cool gear are not an original concept (Starship Troopers, COBRA, Mike O'Neal and his \\"Suits\\" ,even Star Wars ARC troopers, and others), but this book put it together in a very nice fashion with a plot and characters that kept me glued to the book.
B000060K4O|5.0|The first time I saw Ghostbusters I was a little kid. I found it funny at the time, but I never really saw its genius until I got into SNL more, and I watched the likes of Animal House, Stripes, and so on, and I saw what a bunch of brilliant guys had been running around in the late 70s/ early 80s. Ghostbusters has to be my favorite, possibly my favorite comedy. It has great special effects, more quotable lines than Casablanca and Monty Python and the Holy Grail combined, fine casting, and is just plain fun to watch (and again quote).<br /><br />The story for you newbies: three scientists- sarcastic Peter Venkman (Bill Murray at his finest), paranormal expert Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd, who thought up the whole idea), and electronics nerd Egon Spengler (co-writer Harold Ramis, who also helped bring you the earlier listed films) are kicked out of their university, so they decide to form a business that specializes in getting rid of pesky poltergeists and sneaky spirits, aka ghostbusting. With a hearse as a team vehicle, matching suits, proton packs, and an exasperated secretary, the Ghostbusters face giant marshmallow men, the pesky green hotel ghost Slimer, and help beautiful Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) rid her apartment of evil spirits.<br /><br />Still not convinced, or did I have you at giant marshmallow man? Well, basically, if you like comedy, see Ghostbusters. If you like ghost movies, see Ghostbusters. If you like movies, see Ghostbusters. If you want to see me quote a movie almost line-for-line, then watch Ghostbusters with me. I got 'em both.
0553801503|5.0|For the first three novels in the Song of Ice and Fire series, George R.R. Martin did what any self-respecting lover of high fantasy would like to do: annihilate whole kingdoms in a fantastic, destructive orgy of violence.  The pace of the slaughter began in \\"A Game of Thrones\\" in King's Landing, building to a reckless crescendo two books later at the Battle of Blackwater.  A few final notes of violence - the thrum of a crossbow, a wordless scream from the Eyrie - and it was done.  Looking back through two thousand pages of broken bodies, smashed empires and dazed survivors, one must ask, \\"Where can we go from here?\\". <br /> <br />Well, what does one do after a war?  One rebuilds.  One schemes, recruits allies and kills off weakened foes.  One prepares for winter. <br /> <br />\\"A Feast for Crows\\" is the not the same sort of book as the first three, for the simple reason that it cannot be.  Martin cannot simply kill off major characters until we have a Tyrion dancing on their bodies, the victor.  The Seven Kingdoms cannot keep grinding bodies together, heedless of the destruction and coming winter.  This book is what its title promises... the quiet of a finished battle, the descending flock of crows and ravens, the survivors limping back to their homes. <br /> <br />In this book we see Cersei consolidating her power, Sansa learning from the master of political intrigue, Jaime trying so hard to be a better man, Arya training to be the vengeance she so badly wants, Brienne hoping to make good on her oaths and Sam finally being a man.  There are new points of view now too, such as the knight Arys and the Dorne princess Arianne.  Their perspectives help fill out what's happening in Westeros outside of the usual perspectives of the Starks and Lannisters.  The characters are growing, and in large part they are becoming more complex, more powerful and learned. <br /> <br />Books four and five promise to build up what's been broken, giving our heroes and villains something to fight for.  True, book four doesn't have the same level of action as previous novels, but Martin sets the stage with the same masterful sense of pacing and plot we've all come to love.  In books six and seven I expect that the carnage will resume as the true avatars of ice and fire come into conflict. <br /> <br />\\"A Feast for Crows\\" is a good book.  At times, it is a great book.  When it is paired with \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" and we're able to see the whole story I expect it to stand on the same ground with the first three books in the series. <br /> <br />If you love this series, get this book.  But if you do read it, do it with the understanding that Martin is telling a complete story.  A lull in action doesn't mean the man is going senile; the stage is being set for even more appalling violence and chaos.  And isn't that what we're all here for?
B0007GAERG|5.0|What can I say, one of the greatest voices of our generation is back and better than ever.  I guess she proved her critics wrong by showing them that with a powerful voice like hers, she will never be washed up.  This album is a classic must have.  Go get it!
B0002X314C|3.0|I tried to like John Legend's debut album, but when I first heard it, and most times after I first heard it, I couldn't help feeling as if John Legend is forcing emotions. His singing just doesn't feel real, a lot of the things he does with his voice musically doesnt make sense and seems like he's just doing it in an effort to seem soulful but is really not. Plain and simple, the singing or the lyrics dont feel like they are from the heart, but who am I to say whether they are or not, they might be, but I just wasn't feeling it. As far as the music goes, the best songs have a lovely arrangement with piano, guitars, strings, and unfortunatly electronic drum-programming. Another flaw with this album is it has a Kanye West feeling to it, it just feels like Kanye West did most of the musical work here. John Legend makes it seems like he does all the production by parking himself behind a piano in all of his videos but few of the songs here mainly feature the piano, actually none at all except the intro and ordinary people heavily feature the piano, everything else is mostly done by producers. If you want to some real soulful music, with lyrics and singing from the heart, along with excellent music with REAl instruments, not just publicity stunts, try Anthony Hamilton or Lyfe Jennings, they are excellent. I am in no way being a hater, I think John Legend has a lot of potential, I just wasn't feeling this album.
B0007DAZW8|2.0|Remember all those great songs on Discovery? One More Time?  Digital Love? Harder Better Faster Stronger? Something About Us? And remember all those boring, repetitive songs in between? (me neither). Daft Punk decided to do without good songs and focus on boring, repetive ones and we're left with a crap album!  Hurray!
0780626494|4.0|Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone head up a wonderful cast in this lighthearted romantic comedy about a man named Adam Weber's (Fraser) first steps into society after being in a fallout shelter for his entire life.  Fraser's parents are played by the flawless Christopher Walken and the wonderful Sissy Spacek.  Walken is a scientist who mistakes a plane crash in his backyard for a Cuban nuclear missile strike.  He takes his family into a fallout shelter and waits until the time is right to surface.  After thirty-five years, things have changed a tad and he arises to find Joey Slotnick managing a rundown bar/soda fountain.  Thinking that Walken is God, or something similar at least, Slotnick becomes Archbishop Melker in one of the funniest characters I've seen in awhile.  After suffering severe shock, it is decided that Adam should be the one to go to the surface in search of supplies.  He's told to avoid the adult magazine store (invisible, poisonous gas) and to bring back a suitable girlfriend for obvious reasons.<br /><br />Fraser surfaces and begins his quest for food and a woman.  Along the way, he experiences the wonders of color television and sees a black postal worker that illicits one of the funniest lines in the flick.  He runs into Alicia Silverstone, properly named Eve, and befriends her when he realizes he needs a co-pilot in this strange land.  He is then introduced to her friend, Dave Foley, who turns in another wonderful performance.  The story rolls along with Silverstone trying to determine whether or not Adam is off his rocker and falls in love with him along the way.  That's about all I can say without spoiling anything.<br /><br />The fish-out-of-water concept turns in quite a few hilarious scenarios in this film.  Fraser was perfectly cast due to the fact that he can become so innocent and gosh-darn nice that his character is very believable.<br /><br />Pick this one up for a great romantic comedy.  It's light, a little silly at times, but is well worth watching.<br /><br />Highly recommended.but is well worth watching. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|The new cd by Madonna is one that many older and younger fans can injoy and dance to.  Overall the cd was just another cd full of nice and catchy songs, but none more catchy than the enfectous dance hit Hung Up.  This song has gotten plenty of radio and video air time and has made a statement that Madonna is here to stay and will continue to make music for the generation she is living in.  That is the only song worth listning to on the radio and I feel the album will do well with the already good sucess from the song.  She may need to write more like it if she plans on selling more albums though.!
B000001DQI|5.0|1. Funeral For A Friend (Love Lies Bleeding)  - This song gets you set for Elton Johns most epic album with his most epic in your face song that is just full of heart and soul.<br /><br />2. Candle In The Wind  - The original, I really think he should have just made a new song for Diana, instead of just changing the lyrics for this one. The lyric change and rerelease sold impressively.<br /><br />3. Bennie And The Jets - Very classic and catchy. I get this song in my head more then any other elton song it seems. I grew up with this song.<br /><br />4. Goodbye Yellow Brick Road - If the title track of an album isn't good then why give it a chance, but this title track is very classic and great to sing along with.<br /><br />5. This Song Has No Title - Great upbeat fun, so far the songs are still great!!<br /><br />6. Grey Seal - Also nice and upbeat. Great Song!<br /><br />7. Jamaica Jerk-Off  -  Funny, but not my favorite song on here.<br /><br />8. I've Seen That Movie Too  - Quite nice and mellow.<br /><br />9. Sweet Painted Lady  - Just plane beautiful this one is.<br /><br />10. The Ballad Of Danny Bailey (1909-34)  -  Really cool song, this album hasn't got weak yet.<br /><br />11.

0385336810|5.0|I was expecting a fluffy light-hearted book, but one that resembled all the other chick lit books.... <br /> <br />Well, fluffy and light-hearted it was, but it was also unique, not the average book you pick up. A real page turner, I just couldn't put it down, stayed up all night reading it. The only other books that had me so hooked were the HP series, and Sheldon's Naked Face.  <br /> <br />I loved this book, the only flaw was the way the guy blurted certain secrets..his explanation wasnt satisfactory I find, I was expecting a bit more... <br /> <br />But still quite lovely, very funny, and original.
0060012234|5.0|<br />   <br /> \\" I was deep behind enemies lines in the very heart of the opposing camp.  My adversaries were all around me.  For the time being my disguise was hiding but I still felt exposed, naked, as if my secret was obvious to anyone who took time to look.\\" That' how Russle feels as he changes in the boys locker room in his high school. That's where this story mostly takes place. He has a secrete. He wont tell anyone because he`s scared that people and his friends wont except his secret. The secret is that he`s gay. The book is about him struggling to keep his secreted hidden from his two friends, Min and Gunner. They fight, make decisions and make up a lot in this book.  Russ falls for this guy, Kevin Land. He'll do anything to gets Kevin's attention. They end up going out but it doesn't work. Kevin 's Mr. Popular at the high school and Russ is just trying to  be himself.  This book is Young Author.  <br /> <br /> I think this book is the tops because it shows how people are afraid to tell a secret. The people they might tell could react in a different way. It challenges the readers to put themselves in the character's point of view. It's also just a good book to read when you're bored.  You need to know what is going to happen. It can teach the readers to just accept themselves. Well any type of people will like this book. Mostly people who like sad, quick, and happy moments in books. Any age will like this book I think.  It is totally a page turner. You need to know what is going to happen like a TV show.  It's very hard not to concentrate on this book, Geography Club. It's so hard to get distracted in this book.  I didn't connect with any of the characters but with some events. I've been to scared to tell my friends what is on my mind about them `cause I don't want them to get hurt by what I said or hate me for it. I liked the genre because other people can relate to it. <br /> <br /> I like the styling of reading. It's very teenage-ish. Like when the authors uses sokay for ok and stuff like that. I think the biggest surprise was when Kevin turned out to be the other gay kid in the high school.  The chapters don't leave with a cliff hanger. It always summed it up in the next chapter.  It isn't at all boring. My mind wondered a little. I kept on thinking about the events in the book or picturing them in my mind.  The plot wasn't unbelievable. This could happen to anyone everyday.  I think teens will mostly like this book because its written for teens and they will understand better. Read Geography Club. it's REALLY good!
0553801503|5.0|Normally I don't write online reviews, but after reading so many negative reviews about a feast for crows I just had to reasure the people who haven't read it yet, that there are not so few of us who thought the book was great. The quality of writing hasn't changed a bit. It's fantastic. There is a little less action and a slower pace but instead we get to know some characters more deeply, some to love and some to hate, the golden twins. Arya and Sansa are being placed so they can learn and influence things in a greater scale- they're growing up. Many thought Brienne chapters boring and I can't say if she will have an important role in the next books or the main goal of her chapters was achieved showing us the land trying to survive after the war and pulling together some loose ends. But her POV's are worth it just because of her character. Dorne and Iron Islands are the location of the minor POV's. They are less complex but we get to see an overall picture of politic situation in their lands and stop to underestimate their role in the fight that is about to come. A book that makes you want more.
0553801503|2.0|Martin uses this phrase aptly in Feast for Crows, and I can't claim to do it justice in the title of this review.  His writing is the same quality & fun it's always been, and [most of] the characters are still rich and believable.  Nevertheless, Feast is good writing, not a great novel.  It contains detail that is neither enjoyable to read nor relevant to the main line- except perhaps forcibly so.  Rather than tying things together, the story needlessly grows broader and more complex.  I repeat a sentiment echoed in other reviews that perhaps the \\"original\\" plan was better.  Editing 1500 pages- or 2500- into 800 pages of an exclamatory continuation of the first three volumes might have yielded a better read than two separately cluttered volumes.  I could ease up a little by looking at Feast as part 1 of volume 4, and part 2 is of course not out yet.  Perhaps A Dance With Dragons will help redeem Feast, but each of the first three stood on their own.  Unfortunately, number four does not.
B000002GK1|5.0|Let me just skip the critic mumbo jumbo and just tell you this. Soundgarden is a band that combines elements of classic rock, metal, punk, and psychadelia into a very unique style. It is sad that SG has become sort of pigeon-holed as being \\"Grunge\\" when they are actually very different than the other bands put into that genre.<br /><br />If you are a Soundgarden fan you probably already have this album. If not you should definitely buy it.<br /><br />If you have never listened to Soundgarden prior to this then I would recommend Superunknown. It is more accessible. However, if you enjoyed Superunknown, you should buy this album immediately. In my opinion, it is SG's best album.
1400032717|3.0|The author writes about how Christopher thinks, which interests the reader. He thinks like an adult at times, and in a split second he is thinking like a two-year-old. This character shows how everyday situations can be interpreted differently. Thoughts aren't always wrong, right, good or bad. Perceptions of events are important and always vary among individuals. I learned people have different perceptions of the same situations. I can't say I understand all behavior disorders but I can say the book made me more aware. I can at least show kindness and patience to all people. It's not everyday a book can be enjoyed for the story and appreciated as a learning experience. I'm able to appreciate the  <br />growth and change in my own life. I owe Christopher a big thank you.
B000C1YL1G|4.0|Like many Em fans wish he could of included classic unreleased joints like \\"911\\", \\"I Remember\\", \\"The Sauce\\" and deeper cuts like \\"Soldier\\" and \\"Drug Ballad\\" on the Mixtape. I am sure we all have our own greatest hits which is a 3 cd set in my case. As for the new cuts I like \\"when Im Gone\\"- A true Em classic. \\"Shake That\\" is a cool club banger that would of been great if he had recorded it for 'Encore'. I am not a fan of \\"FACK\\". It amazes me how brilliant Em can be at times and then all of a sudden churn out a dud like \\"FACK\\" or \\"Big Weenie\\". Its a shame this has to be the lead off track and perhaps some of his last material for sometime. Still its a well put together product and a great way to remember one of the greatest artists in the past 10 years and who is alive today.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I really love this CD.  Although the songs were written over 30 years ago, they are still relavent.  It takes some songwriters/performers a career to create as many quality songs as there are on this 1 CD of Carole King's.
B000AV2G3I|5.0|Great collection from the man who sported a tampon on his head...not perfect, by any means, but completely enjoyable from start to finish. Quite fitting that it's titled as such, that being the quintessential Lennon song.
B0000026KQ|5.0|A must have along with Blow By Blow and wired. <br />Worth it for Big block and Guitar Shop songs alone. <br />Jeff Beck, the man, the myth, the legend!
B000A2WNB2|5.0|Single I want to ask which has bought this DVD if in fact the format is NTSC, since a proovedor exists that notices that is this in format the PAL, and gives the impression me that all equal is it...  what if I am safe it is that it is an excellent DVD...  I wait for but information on formato(NTSC or the PAL) since if it is the PAL enough that does not buy thanks
B00005AQGH|5.0|REALLY PAC RETURN IN THIS ALBUM  <br />TO SING FROM HIS HART AND ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THAT HE AND THE BLACKS HAD <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> REALLY G.R.E.A.T
B000002KBU|5.0|Possibly Joni's finest. This was, I believe, the first instance of a songwriter exposing so much personal material in song, yet doing it so artfully...this contains many of Joni's finest moments, not least of which is \\"Case of You\\", one of the saddest and most moving love songs ever recorded, by anybody. Joni's crystalline, pure vocals are in top form here, too, though mention must also be made of her impeccable guitar work - her array of unique open tunings are on full display all across this magnificent set.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Finally one of the greatest movies of all time has arrived on DVD the way it should be. It has something for everyone - romance, drama, action, likable characters and very moving music. I loved this movie when it first came out to the theaters and I bought the first DVD release a few years back although it was highly disappointing because there was only the Theatrical trailer and NO other Special Features.  <br />But that one can go now!!! <br />Since I am from Germany I had the choice between the 2-discs Special Edition and a 4-disc Deluxe Edition, which I bought. And I was very pleased to say the least. The Movie itself was much clearer in picture and sound quality having been spread out on two discs. I don't mind changing discs in between, while it was shown in theater here there always was a 10-minute-break.As for the Extras, they are great and very informative for those interested in the history behind it and what went on Behind-the-scenes. The only disappointing element was that the 3-Hour Making Of got cancelled by James Cameron.  <br />After 8 years this movie has not lost anything, it is still compelling and moving me to tears. Not because Of Leonardo DiCaprio, I don't really care for him, but because of the sheer drama behind it. Still a Must-See for everyone.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|This is a wonderful Christmas cd.  I'm not a music expert so I can't point out all the \\"flaws\\".  I can only enjoy it for what it is.....a great cd. If you want something to listen to in the car or nice background music, this is it. A couple of my favorites are One Wish and O come O come Emanuel. How people can say Mariah Careys' cd is better I don't know.  Even when Whitney is not at her full capacity, she is still a far better singer then most of the people out here today. Let's not judge anyone by their personal struggles but by their talent and abilities.  Listen to it...and I think you will enjoy.
B00008AWOG|5.0|Highly addictive....Opeth was recommended to me after I got hooked by Orphaned Land, both being epic and highly crafted metal. Opeth however, is one of the best bands I have ever came across. The lyrics and execution are just top notch...but beyond that, tHE art, the ability of the artist to drow you into the story, through the media of music...wow...music is so powerfull, it stay engraved in your mind long after you heard it, and you keep coming back for more. This is my favorite album among Opeth's discographie, but they are all absolutly amazing, i think even people who are not tuned into metal, would not overlook this masterpiece...life is so short, I'm gratefull for being able to listen to this music in this troubled world, to bad when I'll die I wouldn't be able too listen to this album again....
B000301YY8|2.0|I dunno, man... I was open to this, I really was, but I just can't quite \\"go there\\"...A little too corny (the reviewer below is right), a little too heart-on-sleeve sincere. Something, too, about the timbre of his voice - it's just not pleasing. Pts. for trying.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|My favorite tracks on this album are M.I.A., Betrayed, Burn it Down, and Trashed and Scattered. I would put Bat Country up as a favorite but if it wasn't for my 13 year old cousin listening to this song 50 times a day on a mixed CD with 50 Cent, Fall Out Boy, The Click Five, and Green Day (American Idiot, not the old Green Day), this song might be a favorite of mine. But maybe I'm just being hard headed about not mixing genres. Whatever works for people and brings them joy and all that other good stuff.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I saw Serenity without ever having seen an episode of Firefly. So I think its fair to say that my opinion is not biased by already being a fangirl. I found the movie incredible! I had no idea what to expect, but immediately fell in love with the world Joss created.  <br /> <br />The characters have substance, which is something seriously lacking in a lot of films today. I cared about them immediately, I felt their pain and rejoiced in their triumphs. My love of this movie then sparked my interest in Firefly. So I watched the series and of course loved it.  <br /> <br />I then rewatched Serenity and found it to be even better now that I knew more about the characters.  <br /> <br />So I'm hear to say that you dont already have to be a fan of Firefly to enjoy this movie. Although personally, I think you just might want to check it out after you have seen it. This is definitely a movie that deserved more attention than it got.
B000BDJ1BU|5.0|AMARANTINE     A style that is redolent of `Only Time', it is Enya , working on a hooky pop song with universal lyrics. The melody may draw many at first listen like myself, and for others it may take a little longer. Al though it reminds me of `Only Time' the high chorus owes more to a church choral hymn than a pop song. As a song, I like it much more than `Only Time' which took me awhile to really like.    THE COMB OF THE WINDS    An Enya instrumental with voices. A gentle melody that  is a crisper version of `Midnight Blue' , with the sensibility of `A Day Without Rain' infused with `Drifting'. The mid section features vocalised harmonies that drive it along without overpowering the instrumental section. Then back again to the main melody. As a B side, it most likely had to make way for `Drifting' in the `Amarantine' album.       THE SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME FROM THE CELTS    The first time I hear an Enya composition, really adhering to a style of an existing genre of musical style, that conforms to the style from themes of action Western film. It opens with castanets and dramatic guitar chords, then whistling, percussion as the main melody plays. Enya's most obvious contribution is in the vocalisations, backed by Ryan and Bridgeman. The percussion by Bridgeman gives it dynamics, power and a sense of urgency. The dramatic guitar opener and timely chords within the song, give it the necessary twang. The vocals propel that sense of urgency and motion further. The sound of pealing bells should be familiar to fans who have Enya's `The Celts' recording.   It lends a strong image. The start is like the hero checking the barrels of his revolver, he takes his shotgun and then unties his mount. He puts on his coat and off he goes, galloping away. The mid section where the mission bell tolls tell us of the villain and his henchmen waiting. The track tells us of the hero's swift gallop to the place of showdown. The track ends with the sound of distant pealing bells, of the town square, where the final climactic scene of shoot-outs will be played. Can Enya do a Spaghetti Western? Definitely and convincingly.
B000003BDJ|5.0|This greatest hits package got me very interested in the Stones in the mid 70s and marked a major transition in my musical tastes from pop to rock, back when I was about 13 and just starting high school. While I was long tacitly aware of them, when I was younger, I simply didn't get them. Once I became a teen, I did.<br /><br />Covering on the first disk the Stones major hits, we see their transition from an r&b influenced band to a pop hit maker in the midst of swinging London, to a kind of dark, rebellious force in music (or so the press would have the world believe), exploring some rather dark, adult oriented, and/or political themes which had not apparently been explored in combination to quite that extent. Let's Spend the Night Together is the perfect track to end disk one, as it nicely segues into the classic Stones sound of disk two. It is here in which their sound becomes much looser and much more sensuous and primal. Rarely has a band written as many classic rock and roll songs as Street Fighting Man, Jumpin Jack Flash, Sympathy For The Devil, Honky Tonk Women, Brown Sugar, and Midnight Rambler. There would be more to come, but these songs, along with all the rest of disk two, are where the Rolling Stones secured their legend and their reputation as \\"the world's greatest rock and roll band.\\" Who am I to argue with that assessment?
B000067CPX|4.0|By the Way marked the continuation of RHCP in their alternative Californication style. Gone is the crazed white-boy funk of earlier records. We get more of the moody and haunting melodies. Both styles are fine with me, but as I grow older and the Peppers' grow older, I kind of prefer this new direction. There is a maturity in the music and the lyrics that was not there in the beginning, the boys are growing up and their music is better off for it. Certainly the title track is a strong cut, one of many. However, I think the most unique and refreshing track has to be \\"Warm Tape,\\" a Joy Division-like melody that sounds straight from the new wave '80s. By the way, this is another great album from one of America's greatest treasures.
B000AQBA1W|5.0|Excellent album, beautiful melody & lyrics. The best part of the album was Sharon's solo vocals on Dimming of the Day. Definitely much much better than all of the country/folk songs we have down here. Spancill Hill, Heart like a Wheel & Moorlough Shore also deserve praises. I just hope they would release the album here in U. S. and would get plenty of air time on radio.
B000000OAN|4.0|Queen for me is a band that hasn't really aged all that well. They also stuck around way too late for my liking, with me losing interest in them by around 1977, the year of punk, but also the year that they released Jazz (which of course had nothing to do with jazz.) It seems to me that by then, they had become Freddy Mercury's band, rather than four equal parts. And in becoming Freddy's band, they became more operatic and less rocking.<br /><br />However, as far as A Night At The Opera is concerned, initially I was captivated, like nearly all rock fans back then, by the phenomenal hit single \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" I had never heard anything quite like it at that point. I then picked up the LP, and in the process, discovered something that I really liked.  Queen sort of introduced me to a uniquely British, campy, ironic sensibility and led me on the way to check out other perhaps campier and more ironic British acts as Roxy Music, Mott the Hoople, Brian Eno, Sparks, T Rex and David Bowie (all of which paved the way for the later 70s new wave moment, which was something I jumped upon while losing interest in bands like Queen, I must confess).<br /><br />Listening to the record now, I am struck by how it demonstrates the span of what was possible in rock in the mid 70s. I am also struck by the Beatles (particularly McCartney) influence on the fine song 39, the Led Zep influences on the Prophet's Song, and by how classic sounding and well preserved such songs as I'm In Love With My Car and You're My Best Friend are. In spite of some grandiose arrangements and production values, A Night At The Opera still packs a punch and shows a multi talented and unique band at the height of their creative powers.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|cream is one of the greatest rock bands of all-time.eric clapton,jack bruce,and ginger roger are greats in each of their respected categories. after all these years they're back and as good as ever.they're a bit more bluesy but that is what is expected of 3 guys in their 60's. and for these guys they can still shred,especially clapton.while watching this i could actually feel for their fingers,picturing them bleed at the intensity of their music,fond memories of the past.the best song in the set is probably \\"rollin' and tumblin', but \\"sunshine of your love\\", the closer has to be a close second as they jam away on it.if you're a fan of cream and eric clapton this shouldn't disappoint.only those who don't know what real rock is would disapprove.
B000060MWU|4.0|\\"Lost Highway\\" is undoubtedly one of David Lynch's masterpieces, but the current versions offered for sale are completely sub-par.  Pan & scan, muddy picture, 2-channel sound and no extras--this is shabby treatment for a film with so much to offer!  If you're a Lynch completist, a huge fan of the film, or just plain cheap (the prices offered for \\"new & used\\" are so low they're almost as insane as Lynch's imagination) then I suppose there's no stopping you from adding this to your cart, but please use discretion.  When this is finally released in a form that's better suited to discriminating film fans, then \\"Lost Highway\\" is a must-buy.  Until that day, however, hold your horses, cowpokes.<br /><br />The film itself is a surreal mind-blower with a moebius-strip narrative.  A jazz musician (Bill Pullman) and his wife (Patricia Arquette) recieve a series of videocassettes on their doorstep which show a cameraman invading their home and going right into their bedroom.  The police can't do anything until Arquette is murdered, and the most obvious culprit is Pullman.  He goes to jail (watch for a cameo by punk rock muscleman Henry Rollins) but one night something, uh, \\"strange\\" happens and in the morning the cell is occupied by a young man (Balthazar Getty) with no apparent connection to Pullman, so he's released.  His character is a grease monkey in an auto shop run by the late Richard Pryor (in what is probably his final film role, and displaying symptoms of his MS--to disquieting effect).  Getty gets involved with a psychotic gangster (a very twisted Robert Loggia) and his moll (Arquette again...hmm...).  Meanwhile, there's a mysterious, maybe supernatural character played by Robert Blake(!) who's just plain creepy, and a subplot involving a porn film which gives Lynch fan Marilyn Manson (!!!) a very brief cameo.  The last half hour or so of the film defy explanation, and maybe even interpretation, but the theme of identity, as in state of being, seems to be in question.  The \\"self\\" is ultimately unknowable, and given to shifting at a moment's notice.  The ending leaves us off where we began, leading to the sort of head scratching that even a full bottle of Head & Shoulders won't help.<br /><br />It certainly helps if you're familiar with the films of Bunel and surrealism in general.  Lynch seems to be drawing from a part of the unconscious that even Freud couldn't have guessed at, though.  The fact that he's an avid practitioner of transcendental meditation might give some insight, but not much.  Nevertheless, themes of power and cruelty that Lynch explored in \\"Blue Velvet\\" and \\"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me\\" are continued here, and the new themes of identity are continued in \\"Mulholland Drive,\\" though each stands just fine on their own terms.  Lynch likes the idea of a mystery with no solution (this frustrated both network execs and viewers with \\"Twin Peaks\\") so in the journey of \\"Lost Highway,\\" getting lost is half the fun.<br /><br />Still, if you just can't wait until a superior edition comes around, you're better off renting instead of buying.  When a better edition comes along, you can also knock up rating to five stars.  That even a lousy packaging such as this can get four stars is testament to how highly I hold this film.ion.

B0009K8L5W|5.0|This is one of my fave records of all time...and I'm not even a Shakira fan! I came of age when Pies Descalzos exploded and it was like Shakira had taken my diary and poured all my thoughts and feelings into these songs. Shakira and I are about the same age,so she was around 16-17 when this record came out... I had my first love and my first heartbreak set to \\"Antologia\\", danced to \\"Estoy aqui\\" the first time I sneaked into a club, sang \\"Donde Estas corazon\\" at the top of my lungs with my gf's as we cruised the town when I \\"borrowed\\" my parents car(we thought we were sooo cool), and felt giddy with \\"Te espero sentada\\". One big chunk of the soundtrack of my life went with this record. I wish Shakira would make as heartfelt music as she did in Pies Descalzos...even with all the smoke and mirrors of her latter material, she still hasn't been able to duplicate the simple sincerity of this record.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|How many times are they going to keep delaying the release of this DVD. Whatever excuses they have this time, they are not acceptable. This concert was 12 years ago !!!!! I ordered 2 copies because I wanted to give one as a Christmas gift, but now I find out it won't be available in December as promised (or last year as promised, or whatever.) I would obviously give this a 5 star rating because it is the greatest concert ever filmed, but I am deducting a star for the incredibly inept marketing and distibution of this DVD. Not what one would expect from Pink Floyd.   ****UPDATE DEC 31st 2005 ****  Just visited the EMI website and they show a release date of Jan. 16th 2006... like they say....when pigs fly....
B000002ULO|5.0|McCartney's solo career is a mixed bag; some good stuff, some great stuff, and a lot of stuff that's just plain embarrassing. <br /> <br />Where does this album fit in? It's a classic. Paul hadn't put out such good stuff in years. It's got much better arrangements than Paul's 80's albums like Tug of War (which sounds quite dated), and the songs themselves are just terrific. It's a great mix of rockers and some mellow stuff. <br /> <br />Almost all of the songs on here are very good -- there's very little filler. Somedays, Calico Skies, and Flaming Pie are borderline classics. Ditto to \\"Heaven on a Sunday.\\" The songs seems like pretty simple compositions at first, but that's the beauty of it. McCartney's at his best when he's not trying to do too much. <br /> <br />The only songs that seem forced are \\"Used to Be bad\\" and \\"Really Love You.\\" UTTB is catchy, but just never goes anywhere. And \\"Really Love You\\" can be filed as one of those embarrassing Paul songs. But hey, what's a McCartney album without filler? <br /> <br />If you like Paul's stuff; heck, if you like the Beatles, get this album. A lot of Paul's other solo stuff doesn't do much for me, but this album is excellent.
0385484518|5.0|It is a great story about life.  It encompasses life, love, embarassment, and death.  Anyone can relate to it.  It makes you think about your own life and if you are living it the way you should, or if you are even grateful that you have a life because a lot of people take life forgranted, when you should really live everyday like it is your last.  This book has many different life lessons. I reccommend it to EVERYONE!
B00005NNMJ|5.0|This band was so good it's criminal they weren't bigger. I got to see them twice during their heyday and they were absolute killer! If you are going to play heavy metal, THIS is how it should be played. This band remains grossly underrated as is guitarist Wolf Hoffmann. They blow many of today's bands out of the water. A band like Motley Crue may have sold more records and had more popularity but musically they aren't in Accept's league. for me anyway. And I saw Motley Crue in their heyday.<br /><br />This CD burns. Udo Dirkschneider's vocals may not be to everyone's liking but he's right for this band. When these guys played you knew they meant business, no half-stepping here! The guitar work is absolute killer. Accept's music should be required listening for all aspiring metalheads because this is how it should be done. BALLS TO THE WALL indeed!!<br />[...]

B0007GAERG|3.0|I bought this cd when it first came out and I find it totally messed up that she came out w/ the Ultra whatever it is.  I only like the first 3 songs on this cd.  Which sucks the new Ultra whatever has the better newer songs.  I was already disappointed when I bought this cd.  Can I trade someone this one for the Ultra cd?  I grew up loving her so she gets a higher rating.
B00004W3L3|5.0|First of all, I must admit that I am a fairly new fan of this incredible band. I have to thank Dream Theater for that since I have on multiple occasions heard their name dropped by Petrucci and Portnoy. Oddly enough, I have vague memories of seeing the video for \\"Kayleigh\\" on MTV in the mid 80's (strangely on Headbangers Ball). My first purchase was Seasons End based on the performance of \\"Easter\\" on the Dream Theater DVD \\"5 Years In A Livetime\\". It was then that I remembered the song Kayleigh, a song I'd only heard once as a teen some 20 years ago. How's that for the power of a melody? <br />I was delighted to discover, upon buying Misplaced Childhood, that Kayleigh is merely a taste of the grander scale of this release. Fish, while very Peter Gabriel-ish in terms of range, is a very subtle yet compelling vocalist. With every breath, you can feel the emotions in each syllable, note, and phrase. I can't simply pick out favorites on this because it flows so well as a whole work of art. From the opening notes of \\"Pseudo Silk Kimono\\" to the angst of \\"White Feather\\", each track gels into place. Having listened to this album, I am convinced that they are worth every single bit of praise issued by their peers and the multitudes who site them as an influence. If you have heard of Marillion, yet have not had the pleasure of giving them a listen, I would highly recommend Misplaced Childhood as a starting point. I am looking forward to purchasing more releases from their catalog. I hear great things about \\"Clutching At Straws\\" and \\"Script For A Jester's Tear\\"
B00008973Q|5.0|Dear reader. This is for anyone who has the misfortune of reading Sean Dragon Ninja's vomit-inducing review of this classic.  <br /> <br />Sean, my man, first of all, you know nothing about films, least of all good ones. Secondly, you know nothing about samurai. You think you do, but trust me, you don't. Samurai did regularly use muskets, even if some thought it beneath them. Your whole 'knowledge' of Japan seems to come from the Last Samurai's Hollywoodised version of bushido. You clearly have no understanding of Japanese character or of life in Feudal Japan. This explains your ignorant claims, when reviewing Seven Samurai, another of Kurosawa's classics, that the acting is bad, and that the samurai are savages. Also, why oh why can your tiny mind not realize that not all films have to contain Matrix-style over-the-top action. You say how in Seven Samurai, the action sequences are short and dull, and how in Ran, there are no proper battles, just massacres, and not enough of them. This is because both these films are supposed to be REALISTIC. Why did you expect an action epic, when Ran is based on a Shakespearean tragedy?  <br /> <br />Seriously, one of these days, either I, or another irate, but intelligent (and strangely attractive) reader, is going to come round to your house and poke you remorselessly with a gigantic spear. You can run, Sean Dragon Ninja, but you can't hide. <br /> <br />PS And even if you do hide, I'll find you. <br />PPS Why is your spelling SO bad? <br />
B00005JOHI|4.0|Pride and Prejudice has a fantastically<br /><br />fast-moving opening at an Upper Middle<br /><br />Class social gathering and dance.

The<br /><br />spirited dancing seems to ape the<br /><br />emotions of the Bennet girls as<br /><br />they wander about.<br /><br />The dance features not the usual<br /><br />snobbish Brits but rather a free-<br /><br />wheeling group of normal socialites reflecting<br /><br />the carefree, not posh and not snobbish<br /><br />Bennets, their five daughters<br /><br />and assorted friends.<br /><br />Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth Bennet,<br /><br />Donald Sutherland her besieged, droll<br /><br />rather appalled father.  Mr. Bennet,<br /><br />as in the book, is called Mister even<br /><br />by his daughters.  Every man is Mister.<br /><br />It makes the movie funnier  contrasting<br /><br />the formality of  the Misters with the<br /><br />convivial and fun-loving play of the<br /><br />Bennet girls.<br /><br />Mrs. Bennet is a  shimmering pile of<br /><br />unspent emotional fiery. The girls at any<br /><br />moment, mother included, are likely to<br /><br />lose their heads at the sight of<br /><br />a man with 5,000 a year.  That is<br /><br />if they're not having a joke at his<br /><br />expense at the time.<br /><br />At those moments, Mr. Bennent retreats<br /><br />to his study, where he has a new plant<br /><br />to look at.<br /><br />Only Mrs. Bennet is a straight fortune-<br /><br />hunter.  The Bennet girls somehow have found<br /><br />time to understand genuine love, though<br /><br />Mr. Bennet seems as unaware of this as<br /><br />Mrs. Bennet.  Mr. Bennet seems to have<br /><br />sense you see.  How the girls learned<br /><br />of true love is a mystery.<br /><br />Jane Austen's novel is set in a<br /><br />predatory England.  A man with 1,000<br /><br />pounds will stir interest.  A man<br /><br />with 5,000 creates sheer excitement.<br /><br />Austen predates Dickens and the Bronte<br /><br />Sisters, but the Director has managed<br /><br />to include visuals lifted right from<br /><br />the heather of Wuthering Heights and<br /><br />has placed Elizabeth in settings that just<br /><br />do not exist in the somewhat hardscrabble<br /><br />back yard of the lower middle class Bennets.<br /><br />There is an instance or two of an enormous<br /><br />boar in the house for instance.<br /><br />Elizabeth escapes home with a flock of<br /><br />ducks fluttering about, seeming to<br /><br />imitate her. The image is stolen<br /><br />from the thirties David Copperfield and<br /><br />copied again with great effect in<br /><br />Tom Jones.<br /><br />The only true snob in the film is Mister<br /><br />Darcy.  Poor Mister Darcy,<br /><br />he cannot bring himself to speak to most<br /><br />women, considering them trivial.  He<br /><br />boorishly connives to torpedo Elizabeth's<br /><br />sister Mary's budding romance with the<br /><br />handsome though high-haired Mr. Bingley.<br /><br />At the dance opening of the film, Elizabeth<br /><br />finds Darcy odd at first, then turns squarely<br /><br />against him after encountering  his<br /><br />more offensive traits. The audience knows<br /><br />that both are intrigued and Darcy may even<br /><br />be smitten.<br /><br />There is Mr. Collins, who, spotting Elizabeth<br /><br />at the dance, immediately cocks his hat for<br /><br />her.  Only Lizzy is taller than he, his designs<br /><br />on her seem more about money than love, and<br /><br />besides, he and the film are moving too fast.<br /><br />There's room for one bounder in the shape of<br /><br />Mr. Wickham, who, it develops, knows and dislikes<br /><br />Mr. Darcy as much as Elizabeth and tells her<br /><br />so.  A frame or two later he has run off with<br /><br />one of Elizabeth's sisters.  Mr. Collins too<br /><br />has found matrimonial bliss in Elizabeth's friend<br /><br />who confides to Elizabeth that she hasn't<br /><br />attributes enough to wait for love to arrive<br /><br />at her door as Elizabeth has.<br /><br />The new Pride and Prejudice is certain to be<br /><br />compared with the 1995 BBC miniseries starring Colin<br /><br />Firth as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth.<br /><br />Keira Knightley, who ran away with the movie<br /><br />King Arthur two years ago, owns this film too.

0345440900|5.0|I agree with some of the reviews I have read. But as a mother of 2 totally different 'typed children' you need to have more than just one 'specialist' up your sleeve. You can't possibly agree with every author or specialist out there! I found with my first son that the Babywhisperer was a wonderful book to reference. He was however, a very easy baby, and went along with what ever we did. My second son however, I thank God I had Tracy's books. He is a touchy baby by nature and was very hard to read and understand. Everyone told me he had colic. I am not one for labeling a problem just so I can ignore it. I re-read this book searching for answers, and there it was 'touchy'. He just needed to have less stimulation than other babies. He needed me to pay more attention to his sleep signals. I am very attatched to both of my boys and feel that as a parent you cannot label your parenting style. Read lots of books and tailor yours and your childs needs individually. This book is one I highly recomend having handy for every parent. And in Tracy's memory I give these books out to expecting moms I know.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|The fact that Matthew Bellamy of Muse sounds a lot like Thom York from Radiohead is not a bad thing by any means. It's not very often that a singer sings with his heart on his sleeve anymore. Sure, a lot singers scream their lyrics but what Bellamy is he uses his amazing vocal range and transforms each song into an experience. Not since Eddie Vedder, Kurt Cobain, Roger Daltrey, or Robert Plant has a singer been so into the music. Let any singer out there try and sing the songs on this album and see if the songs have half the heart as they do when Bellamy sings them. You will find that they will not come close. I agree that there are a few vocalists out there who could sing these songs and do a great job (Scott Weiland, Eddie Vedder, etc) but the point I'm making is that Bellamy has a unique and mesmerizing voice that hits you like a sledgehammer one minute and calms you the next. The best song on this album (in my humble opinion) is \\"Bliss\\". The song \\"New Born\\" is featured in the movie \\"High Tension\\" just as a little foot note for those of you who didn't know that.  <br />I must say when comparing the two Muse albums I own (Absolution and Origin of Symmetry) this is the better of the two. This album seems more complete and is full of more quality songs. Bellamy's vocal skills shine in this album as well and I don't feel he shows his true potential in the new Absolution. Bottom line: I love this album and you should too. Buy it, NOW!
B000BVEKO0|5.0|Okay I've been listening to korn since I was in the second grade and im fifteen now and they have still have not disapointed me!! Korn is the greatest band ever. This album is a lot different from the last ones but still kicks a**!! Its got all the signature korn sounds from munkys heavy melodic guitar riffs, Davids pulse pounding drums (now with some double bass real cool), Fieldys funky groovin bass lines and last but certainly not least Jons growls and emotional yells and now with creepy industrial sounds. This album is an absolute masterpiece koRns done it again. Pick up a copy trust me.
0064430227|5.0|Not only is this a favorite bedtime read for both my 2-year-old and my 5-year-old, but it was also one of my favorite books when I was a child.  The way in which the little boy draws up his own world is so compelling that you long to jump in and explore right beside him.  Harold's world of vivid purple lines is fantastic, mysterious, and even haunting.  When I read the book, it is clear that Harold only reveals to us a brief but tantalizing glimpse into this vast realm of his.  As we close the book each night, we continue to wonder: Where does that road eventually lead?  Who lives in the city?  What lies under the waters of the ocean?  And, most importantly: Are the apples still safe?
B000AMWIVM|5.0|Okay, this was a flat out creepy movie. But, very brilliant!!!! The story is very simple and gets straight to the point. A killer named Jigsaw is bent on teaching his victims to appreciate what they have in life, the hard way!!!  Especially, two victims that are chained together in a rundown warehouse. Now, the two victims have to figure out their connection together or else. One of the victims can kiss their loved ones goodbye. Like I said, very creepy. But, good!!!!
B000301YY8|5.0|I have been a huge fan of this guy for several months now, and I'm so glad that he's finally getting props for being so awesome!  I just hope that all this hype doesn't ruin his music or style...sometimes going mainstream can be more detrimental than helpful to artists.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've never written a review on Amazon before, but I had to write one about this series.  Firefly was just incredible.  What a find!  I'm a cynical 40 year old lawyer who basically derives very little pleasure out of life, so it was truly a treat to find this box set and escape into the Firefly 'verse for a while
B00005JO1P|5.0|Wow, I didn't expect this kind of autobiographical story to be such a hit on the big screen, I had heard it was good, so when my brother invited me to the movies I went and was not disappointed.  I'm not a big country fan, and to be honest, I'd never even heard of June Carter, so I don't think it's the music link that necessarily makes this movie work so well.<br /><br />That isn't to say the music wasn't first rate and really made the movie flow and there were also some great scenes showing a young Elvis and other stars that toured with Cash when he was first starting out and met Carter (played wonderfully by Reese Witherspoon).  All the acting and singing was great.<br /><br />The real story here is a love story, and unfortunately it also includes lies, adultery, drug use and horrible neglect of ones children.  Life is pain, I believe Scott Peck said that, or something similar, and this movie really shows life as pain.  Never the less, there is redemption too for without it no story would be worth much.<br /><br />There is no reason to get into all the arguments one can make as to why Cash's relationship with Carter was wrong when it started out, he was married and had children, however, before a judgment can be made all the facts need to be known, and here at least, in this film, we are only given a glimpse.  What we do see, however, and perhaps that's the story Cash really wanted us to see when he wrote his story (which was used to write the screen play) is that June Carter loved Cash and her love rescued him from a life of self imposed hell inflicted in many ways but most prominently through the abuse of pills.<br /><br />This next couple of sentences contain a couple of scenes from the movie, minor but perhaps spoilers, so skip if you'd like, anyway, I really thought the scene in which June takes John back to church was moving and it spoke volumes, it was very brief, however, in some way, it made the movie all tie together.  The other short but important telling scene, I only wish I could believe it really happened (perhaps I need to read the book and see) is when Cash is recovering and the Carter family confronts the drug dealer with shot guns.  I'd like to think that scene was real and I'd wish we'd see more of that today.  In any case, that kind of loving friendship was what June offered Johnny and that's why this movie is really a great love story (in spite of the horrible back story and what is I'm sure still lingering pain in the children he had with his first wife).<br /><br />All that said, I highly recommend this movie, go see it on the big screen.ortant telling scene, I only wish I could believe it really happened (perhaps I need to read the book and see) is when Cash is recovering and the Carter family confronts the drug dealer with shot guns.

B000ATQYT2|3.0|I'm sorry to say that the bizarre antics of the Disney production staff have continued. You have two ways of watching this new 2005 version. 1.) You may watch it with the sides chopped off ( Formatted for your screen. Who's screen? Not mine, I own an HD widescreen monitor.) but the movie is unedited, (although it's a grainy, jittery copy); or 2.) You may watch it in a beautiful new anamorphic widescreen print with the very meaningful song, \\"The Love Is Gone\\", ripped completely out of the film. Needless to say, I'm a little upset. This is one of my favorite movies. I watch it EVERY year at Christmas. Now it appears I'll have to watch chapters 1-4 in widescreen, switch over to fullscreen for chapter 5, then finish the film by going back to the widescreen version for chapters 6-End. Disney, if you're listening, WHEN WILL IT END? I can put up with the hands and feet being chopped off of people in Pollyanna and Old Yeller, but this release of The Muppet Christmas Carol earns you a new  low. I am utterly disgusted.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|Personally I prefer the driving scenes from MANOS THE HANDS OF FATE...
B00005R24G|5.0|<br />Well, wouldn't you know it? I finally get around to changing over to DVD from my VHS library, and sure enough I find one classic film after another short-shrifted in one way or another by the suits. <br /> <br />Where to begin. <br /> <br />This film is so good in all possible ways it hardly admits expression. Michael Caine, who does have a modicum of talent, but nothing more, actually doesn't come off too bad alongside the master, none other than Laurence Olivier himself, and pretty much at his best at that given the screenplay par excellence by Anthony Shaffer wedded to the inspired direction of Joseph Manckiewicz, working on what turned out to be his last film. I wouldn't know how to fault this collective effort. Even the musical score by John Addison is topnotch. All in all, the film never misses a beat--not one single beat. <br /> <br />Of course, it won't be for everyone. For instance, the viewer is expected to pay close attention throughout. This is not a film for potty breaks and popcorn runs. Also, there are no car crashes with accompanying LFE and all that, or new-age music to hum along to. And the more educated the viewer then the more the movie's riveting humor and dialog must tellingly strike home. <br /> <br />I don't know what else to say. Without a doubt it's Caine's best performance (in my judgment his next best would be his screen debut in Zulu), and for my money Olivier, who had more talent in his little finger than most so-called movie stars even dream of, never seemed more at ease with a role. <br /> <br />As for the plot: this movie is all about its plot, which is so tightly and expertly interwoven that to mention much at all would be to give something important away, and what would be the fun in that? So I think it's best for anyone who has not yet seen this picture to snare a copy somehow (it appears to be long out of print--maybe one day someone in corporate will throw us a bone and restore and present this film properly--yeah, I know, I'm dreaming), take the phone off the hook, and sit down for a scintillating session of rare and accomplished entertainment. <br />
B000AADYYO|5.0|Wow...  I've read a lot of people raving about Opeth, and never really understood why.  I mean, sure, they sounded pretty decent judging by the sound samples, but I don't listen to a lot of metal like this so I couldn't understand so many Tool fans being obsessed with Opeth.  It seemed to me (once again, judging by the 30 second samples) that Opeth had no such similarity to Tool at all. <br /> <br />Then one day, out of frustration with the modern music scene, I decided to say \\"F**k it\\" and purchase an Opeth CD.  The first one I bought was \\"Damnation,\\" and whereas I extremely enjoyed the album as a \\"mellow mood\\" thing, I wasn't yet convinced Opeth is everything their fans say about them. <br /> <br />However, I did indeed like it enough to give their heavier albums a chance too, so I went and purchased Ghost Reveries... <br /> <br />NEEDLESS TO SAY, I HAD MY ASS KICKED, KICKED AROUND SOME MORE, HANDED TO ME, AND KICKED ONCE MORE FOR GOOD MEASURE! <br /> <br />I got smacked in the face by a hot glazed Opeth pie.  I understand my fellow hardcore Tool fans being in love with Opeth now.  It's the fact that their music has somewhat of an original sound to it in the way they put their songs together (similar to that of Tool).  It's like an orchestration of metal, with changes of pace here and there, soft moments followed by heavy moments followed by softer moments etc...  I feel like I'm watching some grand theater presentation when I'm listening to this album. <br /> <br />I plan on purchasing more Opeth whenever the Christmas season is over and I have more spare money again. <br /> <br />I think Ghost Reveries would be an excellent starting point for people to be introduced to Opeth, because it was the one that hooked me!  It has it all! <br /> <br />Peace, <br />-=][V][=-
B0009HLDFU|3.0|I would call this FF's best album since \\"The Colour and the Shape,\\" but there's a problem: What I loved about \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" was the inter-mingling of the calm and quiet with the big and explosive.  Grohl even masterfully blended all of these in single tracks.  \\"In Your Honor\\" also shows both sides, but only one side at a time.    Disk 1 contains all the hard-hitting, screaming rock you'd expect from Grohl.  Disk 2 is all acoustic, all mellow.  Both disks do pretty well within their assigned purposes, but I think it was a mistake to keep the two separate.  I find it pretty monotonous to have only one type of song playing for over 40 minutes at a time.  A great album is greater than the sum of its individual tracks; but this album has two types songs, neatly categorized, which get tired too quickly.  I keep hoping that Grohl and the rest get back to synthesizing their broader than average range into one great album, but I'll have to wait for the next one.  I think the Foo Fighters are missing what could make them truly legendary rather than just another rock band.

B00005JNEW|5.0|I don't like football, im just the girlfriend of someone who does and despite this I loved this movie. It doesnt depict the typical \\"go for the championship\\" kind of sports plot. The movie is about the social realites of a small town's only release from the mundane through football and how this dependance can affect individuals. If you are looking for a movie that will put you on an emotional rollercoaster, doesnt insult your intelligence and still has all the great action shots of the game then this is the movie. It's real, in your face and deeper than than the typical sports movie (and trust me ive seen a lot).
0062502182|1.0|I read this book primarily on the reccomendation of a few rich and aimless friends. Most of whom have never read neither literature or philosophy, as I assume this passes for both if you've never cracked a book. Here's the spoiler: CARPE DIEM. Seize the day. I guess this watered-down new age bunk flies with the trustafarian crowd, but it strikes me as juvenile. It takes this guy over one hundred pages to say that, and who knows how much money he's made off of this well-dressed self-help book. CARPE DIEM. There. Hopefully I've saved you a couple of hours.
055380457X|3.0|In recent times Google has become an all pervading phenomenon. As the modern net savvy generation comes to grip with Google beyond the Search Engine, this book traces the rise and occasional bumpy road to hacker fame for the Google founders and the company. <br /> <br />In a very easy to read fashion, David runs you through the basic idea of Google, the intent of the company and of course the leitmotiff of Do No Evil. However, all said and done the book is light on insights. There are really no inputs in the book on the Google Architecture, the process of Data Mining or even why indexing the world wide web is such a big task (although there are plenty of references to it). What it does bring out is the sheer focus of the Google team towards ensuring repetitive business through increasing the customer touch points. In a way this could be a good primer for aspiring businesses.  <br /> <br />Don't read too much into it and if you have a long flight I would recommend that you get this instead of some fancy fiction.
0201633612|5.0|If you know object oriented programming, this book will show you how to design better programs. I like it  because it has real life examples. It also has the source codes illustrating how to implement each design patterns. The book is well organized and clearly written. The best book I have right now on design pattern. Now I remember back in the school day; it's quite sad that some professors cannot even teach this topic right. They define and show you design patterns, but they fail miserably to show you the how and the why. How to implement each pattern and why use it and in what situation would each pattern be used. That's what school is all about! You paid to learn which will save you time learning it yourself.All they have to do is teach something that someone has already figured out or done all the work for them, and they cannot even do it right. Quite sad for the students!
B000BVD460|4.0|Everyone seems to be bagging on Eminem lately.  people say that slim shady lp and the marshall mathers lp were classics.  They were classics, but he cannot stay on that immature level forever.  His music is growing along with himself.  If he was still rapping like he was on the slim shady lp, people would be tired of it and would be complaining once again.  i think people under estimate Encore.  Listen to the rap on the radio, ENcore is easily 8 years ahead of all that garbage.  This cd was a nice collection of his commerical hits.  He was quoted as saying there were songs that he liked and songs that the masses enjoyed.  He said this cd was for the masses.  Everyone has their favorite eminem songs, but this was a good mix of all his commercial success through his career.  He is a talented rapper and is better than 90 percent of them out there.

KORN FANS NEED TO ADD THIS ONE TO THEIR COLLECTION!!!
1591396190|5.0|It is not the ideas that makes this book great. The idea of 'untapped markets' and 'making competition redundant' are as old as oceans of all hues.<br /><br />The real strength of this book is its compilation of cases. Taking examples from several industries - circus, transportation, wine, and many more, the authors create a compelling list of 'tried and tested' ideas to pursue. While some of the cases are well known and documented, there are several others that are extremely stimulating.<br /><br />This book did not really help me resolve the Red-Blue dilemma, but it did provide a lot of food for thought in searching for new opportunities.

B00005JMYI|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I liked Anchorman.  But not as much as wanted to.  The problem is, in a comedy your lead actor has to be the funniest person in it.  Farrell was a distant 5th, and that's only because I can't remember the bartender's name.<br /><br />Steve Carell and Paul Rudd stole this movie handily.  Then Fred Willard, who has a knack for fantastic cameo roles, takes third.  Remember him in 'Best in Show', good stuff.  Then Christina Applegate out performs the lead.  Not the sign of a good comedy.<br /><br />By the way, aren't we getting a little tired of Will Farrell yet?  And this may be a spoiler, but enough with Jack Black and Ben Stiller.  I think we have all seen enough of Black's lame karate poses on the red carpet at premiere night.<br /><br />The DVD has some nice extras.  The music video is okay, but the deleted scenes and blooper reel are the best extras.  Unfortunately, they may be the best things on the disc, including the movie.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|Monica Bellucci is the main villain in this movie, and she is thwarted before she even comes to power, and so the protagonists of the movie don't acheive a decent ending since they are not fighting a decent villain. They would have been in no real danger from her unless she was fully capable. This story could have taken lessons from the more successful villans of Disney, or perhaps Jean Marsh in Willow as well as Return to Oz. A hero and story seem only as good as the opposing force. This movie has none, with the exception of the French against the village. This movie isn't about the French it is about fairy tales come to life. There is not much of a tale here without a villan.
0786915749|4.0|I first read this trilogy when I was in high-school so many years ago (when TSR still ruled the gaming world) and recently picked up the series again just for the heck of it. Upon cracking open the cover, I was immediately transported back to the world, the characters, and the stories that I loved so much back in the day. <br />Perhaps the writing is sophomoric at times, perhaps the plot is a bit clichd and the characters can be a tad 2 dement ional-but who cares? It is an enjoyable, easy read that takes you away to a world  you wish you could live in.  <br />As for comparisons to the Lord of the Rings, I find Tolkien to be too heavy a read at times when I just want to have a light-hearted adventure. If you want hard-core, go read the Rings Trilogy. If you want fun and action, read the \\"Dragons of...\\" Trilogy.
B00005UW9T|5.0|You would never know that after watching this movie there would be such a sad tale behind it. When I was younger I was facinated by it and sought to learn more about it. The family, the history, the unhappily ever after that still consumes Russia even to this day and how it cries out for the Royal family to take it's rightful place. Anastasia however is the real mystery. Whatever happend to the young girl everyone wants to know. Did she die? Perhaps. Did she live on? We hope. Did she find peace? We dream. However as we all know life is not like that. So for the hopeful romantics, and dreamers the disney version Anastasia is the movie for you.  <br /> <br />It holds everything that we wish was real. That the young girl survived, lived, had adventure and found her way back to her grandmama as well as defeating the evil Rasputin! Meg Ryan portrays her beautifuly by giving Anastasia spirit, independence, and that thirst for life that we can all relate too. Even now as I watch mesmerized by the characters, the dialog and the over all picture its self I can only imagen what happend, what should of been and the little princess that never got her happy ending.  <br /> <br />This movie even though changed by adults to fit in the world of the childs mind. Is in my opinion the happy ending to the lost princess Anastasia should should have had. Not only that but it  makes children and adults a like, believe even just for one moment... that she could still be out there....just waiting to be  found.
B000AYEIZY|2.0|Granted, these guys haven't played together for nearly 40 years.  Granted, they've moved in very different directions since their breakup. Granted, my standards are probably a bit too high.  But.  This is a Cream reunion, and so standards should naturally be higher than usual.  These shows lack the fire and the passion characteristic of one of the original supergroup - the kind of bold, loud rock that just blows you away.  The kind of incredible three-way talent and jamming that made for a timeless band whose reputation was made on live shows.  I, like everybody else, was absolutely elated when I heard The Cream were reuniting in concert.  I couldn't believe the CDs weren't out on May the 6th.  It eventually came out, and I grabbed it the day it hit the shelves.  I was disappointed.  Much to my displeasure, I found these performances lacking the heart and soul of a Cream concert from days gone by.  Look no further than \\"Crossroads\\" and \\"Deserted Cities of the Heart,\\" absolute classics in their original form, but mere shadows of their original selves here.  To say \\"lifeless\\" would be uncalled for (and an overstatement), but they are definitely lacking that characteristic Creamesque brillance.  I truly don't understand what the rave reviews are all about (I assume everybody is reviewing the same concert here).  I tend to doubt that these two got together solely for the sake of money (a larger tour would make more sense if the intent was to make a profit).  However, I do feel that it is quite evident here that time has taken its toll.  Check out Wheels of Fire, Live Cream, and Live Cream Vol. 2 (if only for \\"Deserted Cities of the Heart\\" and \\"Steppin' Out\\") for the real deal.  To all the people who disagree: go ahead and click the \\"No\\" button below - I gave a fair review and I'm sticking to it.
B0007XT87G|5.0|There is NO disc protection on this CD!!!  There must be something wrong with his disc or something.  I had no problem ripping the CD on my computer.  Besides that the CD is brillant!!!
B000BVEKO0|4.0|I've become pretty pessimistic musically this year.  After being really disappointed with Mudvayne's new disk as well as Fear Factory's new one I was fairly disjointed with my mainstream metal favorites (however my less mainstream Isis, Neurosis, Opeth, and Tool collections kept me happy).  After Korn's last album, Take a Look in the Mirror, as well as the obvious loss of Head, coupled with my rising fear that Korn had indeed finally hit the downhill slide.  Then I heard Twisted Transistor and read about the subsequent making of the video featuring four rappers, er, not rappers, posers rapping shi#&y lyrics over recycled beats and annoying samples.  This did it for me, \\"See You on the Other Side is going to suck\\" I said to myself.  Even so, in the week leading up to the release I brushed over my collection, focusing on my two favorites, Issues and Untouchables.  IF liking those two albums the best means I'm not a \\"hardcore\\" Korn fan then so be it, but to me those records were just superior to all the rest in style, emotion, and lyrically as well.  I started to remember why I used to love these guys so I broke down and bought the new one, and I must say I was proven wrong.  This is how I'm rationalizing Korn's supposed revitalization.  After Untouchables I read many reviews, and the general consensus was that it and Issues were regarded by \\"hardcore\\" Korn fans as crap basically.  Yea a lot thought they were good or great like me, but still, to say they weren't close to the self titled or LIP doesn't sound right to me.  At the height of Korn's pompacity (money, greed, etc.) they stopped the direction they were headed stylistically.  They stopped evolving, or, stopped making the music they wanted to make.  Thus TALITM came.  So many times it seems as though the lyrics and vocals from John are forced and just don't have that pure emotion behind it, though there was one really decent song on it (When Will This End?).  After that record didn't launch them back into fan'sgood graces, and the loss of Head, it seems like Korn just decided to do away with worrying about everyone else and made the record they wanted.  What came out really a lot of the time doesn;t even sound like Korn, some songs sound very NIN'ish, which is a good thing.  John's lyrics focused on some worldly issues like politics and religion, as well as the usual internal struggles he is known for displaying so well.  The Korn'ish songs are 100% Korn, the new style songs are good, and the song that for me stands out all on it's own, Tearjerker is amazing.  Being a progressive metal freak, loving the melodic slower tempo emotional songs Tearjerker just slays any song on this disk to me.  They tapped a resource that made Untouchables so great in my mind, which was that John can actually sing in his own nasaly way, and produce heartfelt yet still dark or angry songs.  Other standouts are Love Song, Seen It All, and Souvenir, but they are all good for the most part (still haven't warmed up to Twisted).  In all, download if you're \\"hardcore\\" and want the collection to be complete, but if you're aware and embracing of the evolution of a band through time, then buy this record.  Along with the music the packaging is pretty sweet too.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I'm a fan of Greek Mythology and 'Troy' gives 100% and comes out gold. From the actors to the beautiful scenery, \\"Troy\\" is a film of brilliance.<br /><br />Brad Pitt fits the role of Achilles perfectly. Everyone does a great job in their characters. The story is really one of tragedy and misunderstandings. You notice in this film that a lot of the destruction and death was caused by wrong decisions. I really do love this movie, and if you love the story of the Trojan War and you love Greek Mythology. This is for you!
B00000J2SO|5.0|*Down To Earth* is probably the most underrated and overlooked of the Rainbow albums, it's stuck right between the infamous Dio albums and the radio-freindly Turner years. <br /> <br />Graham Bonnett is one of the greatest voices in rock period. I don't know why he isn't more well-known in the realm of rock, as after Rainbow he went on to work with other famous guitarists (i.e. Schenker, Malmsteen). This austrilian ex-pop singer does himself proud on tracks like \\"All Night Long\\", \\"Makin Love\\" and \\"Lost in Hollywood\\". I hope one day they release a \\"Best Of\\" CD with all of bands Graham has worked with, that would be ridculous. Unfortunatly, Blackmore only kept him for one album, and this is what we have, *Down To Earth*. The album has Ritchie playing at a much more controlled and refined direction, much more feeling and emotion in the solos and riffs. I know it marks the end with the \\"Medival\\" theme the band had earlier, but this is non the less a perfect rock album; lots of memorable riffs, cool vocals, pounding drums and 70's sounding keyboards. You really can't go wrong if you are looking for hard driving blues rock. It certainly beats the junk thats paraded as \\"rock\\" these days, polluting radio airwaves. <br /> <br />Also, keep in mind that this came out in 79, the dawn of the 1980s was right around the corner, so this was the last hurrah of qaulity 70s hard-rock before the gendre became artifical, sanitized commercial shlock on MTV. Even Rainbow themselves would get a little too much sugary for my taste after this. Rainbow's last really spectacular album IMHO.
B00004RF83|4.0|\\"The Manchurian Candidate,\\" another John Frankenheimer film which preceded \\"Seven Days In May\\" by two years, has drawn more critical praise, and perhaps deservedly so; its insane assassination plot against a Presidential hopeful is carried off brilliantly. Nonetheless, for my money, this film actually works a bit better, partly because of the fascinating behind-the-scenes look it provides at the workings of the Joint Chiefs and the Oval Office, partly because of a superior cast, and partly because the plot here (to overthrow a sitting President) is more plausible and thus more alarming. The love interest involving Ava Gardner is a bit of a throwaway, which is a shame because it wastes a charismatic actress. The rest of the film, however, is gripping and tightly told, and works in much the same suspense mold as \\"Candidate.\\" Perhaps the best solution is just to buy them both and treat yourself to a double-feature. You'll never trust your government again (not that many of us do now).
B00003CXI1|4.0|I purchased this DVD quite some time ago....and quite frankly, I should bequeath upon it FIVE stars instead of four...and would have EXCEPT for something that happened this last weekend.<br /><br />I was visiting friends for the weekend and on Saturday (I think), ABC Family Channel was showing Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone. It was a dreary afternoon so my friends and I settled down to a couple of hours of watching young Harry in his first year at Hogwarts. Suddenly, while watching the movie, I sat up and exclaimed out loud. \\"Hey, that wasn't in the movie!\\" Indeed, my friends and I agreed that we had just witnessed a scene that was not in the DVD version we all had (and therefore assumed not in the theatrical version either). After that first surprise, we watched with rapt attention and extra scene after extra scene passed before us to the place where we were kinda making it into a game as to who would discover something new first.<br /><br />Well I was excited at the notion that maybe the makers of the Potter movies were doing what Peter Jackson did with LOTR: namely, bring out extended versions of the original movies, a year or two after the first DVD release,<br /><br />When I got back home, I knew I had to find out if extended versions were indeed coming out. Of course I went to Amazon. com. ...only to read MenollyK's review which stated that the original DVDs were actually trimmed down versions of the movies that were seen in the theatres. I hadn't seen the first two Potter movies in the theatres so I wouldn't have known this. I remembered how George Lucas had trimmed down the very first VCR versions of Star Wars, episode IV back in the early 80's, And just like Lucas I supposed the powers-that-be behind the Potter films didn't think the viewers would notice (let alone mind) if they also cut a few things out. Of course, someone could buy the special edition DVD and I guess these scenes can be seen separately from the rest of the movie ...BUT really, what my friends and I saw on Saturday was extraordinary; the extra snippets here and there only added to the magic of the story! Who could possibly be upset at their addition to a film a whole lot of us have loved from the get-go.<br /><br />SO, I give the DVD version of The Sorceror's Stone FIVE stars because the movie is still wonderful; minus ONE star because someone decided that those extra scenes weren't necessary for those of us who paid good money for the DVD (even tho ABC Family Channel apparentally thought otherwise).<br /><br />Who knows, maybe there is a charm (or a curse) that will compell the powers-that-be to release the movies in their entirety some day. Until then, take care!, what my friends and I saw on Saturday was extraordinary; the extra snippets here and there only added to the magic of the story! Who could possibly be upset at their addition to a film a whole lot of us have loved from the get-go. <br /> <br />SO, I give the DVD version of The Sorceror's Stone FIVE stars because the movie is still wonderful; minus ONE star because someone decided that those extra scenes weren't necessary for those of us who paid good money for the DVD (even tho ABC Family Channel apparentally thought otherwise). <br /> <br />Who knows, maybe there is a charm (or a curse) that will compell the powers-that-be to release the movies in their entirety some day.

B0002XNSY0|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's work has been so over-analyzed that it's difficult to step back and just appreciate his films as simple entertainment anymore. But even without all the film-school jargon, \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" is a heck of a lot of fun, and this edition packs on a lot of great extras. Come see Peter Sellers' three hilarious portrayals in one film; see Slim Pickens ride the bomb; see George C. Scott give the over-the-top performance that he thought Kubrick was going to leave on the cutting room floor in favor of other takes; see Sterling Hayden's finest (and most surreal) turn, as Col. Jack Ripper. Laugh the entire way, and leave the dissection of the minutae to the would-be auteurs.    Better yet, treat yourself to a double-feature: \\"Fail Safe\\" first and then \\"Dr. Strangelove.\\" Two classic perspectives on a Cold War apocalypse. Take it seriously and then laugh at it (cuz it rarely works to do it the other way around). And remember: There's no fighting in here; this is the War Room!
0385486804|1.0|I am giving this book only 1 star not because of Krakauer's writing--the story is very readable, its a page turner for sure.  But the tale he tells--grating and galling to say the least.    The author desparately tries to make the demise of Chris McCandless into some tragic siren tale.  Although he protested otherwise, it seemed Krakauer truly perceived on some level that McCandless is some patron saint of independence and  environmental idealism.      McCandless decisions and actions were not only misguided but it struck me again and again as utterly disrespectful to the wilderness he proported to revere.    Marching off into the wilds of Alaska without any kind of idea about the land, its plant and wild life or its topography may seem to some people the ultimate fantasy of \\"getting in touch with nature\\".  To me, it strikes me as yet another example exemplifying western culture's utter distain and disrespect for nature.      As an Athabascan (alaskan native), our culture is frought with stories about the fickleness of nature over trivial matters such as man's survival.  Again and again our stories illustrate the due respect deserved to our elders for their knowledge about surviving off the land.    Chris McCandless was an arrogant, foolish boy-man.  I truly regret the pain his pointless death caused his family.
B000056JYC|4.0|There's nothing new to say about an album this familiar, popular, and previously-analyzed. This was a landmark release of the 70's; its hits remain staples of the classic rock format, and probably always will. So let's skip right to what makes the Deluxe Edition worth buying.    First, the sound: These recordings have been nicely remastered. There is detail audible now that you would never have caught on the original release or on any of the various Greatest Hits collections. The new, expanded packaging also adds to the value. It includes the original liner notes by Cameron Crowe, along with a new booklet with a reflective essay, full lyrics, and archival photos. The four previously unreleased tracks are \\"Just the Time of Year,\\" \\"Nowhere's Too Far For My Baby,\\" \\"White Sugar,\\" and \\"Day's Dawning.\\" The first three are excellent live recordings from the same tour and flow smoothly into the existing mix, though I would've put \\"Nowhere's Too Far\\" after \\"(I'll Give You) Money,\\" since the latter makes such a great kick-off for the second disc. \\"Day's Dawning\\" is an alternate studio version of a track that originally led off 1975's \\"Frampton.\\" It's pleasant enough, but is a somewhat incongruous and unexciting non-live track to cap off a legendary live album.    All in all, an iconic record of the `70's has been handsomely updated. Not cheap, but worth it.
B000286S8S|5.0|C'mon, everyone knows that Van Halen is one of the best rock bands ever, and they have so many hits. It's impossible for them to put everyone of their hits onto a CD, because it would take a 5 disc set with a $100 price tag. They did a good job of putting popular hits on the CD and hits that only Van Halen fans know. Metallica is my favorite band (followed by Van Halen) and Metallica has the same problem, to put all of their hits into a greatest hits collection is impossible, because Metallica has so many great songs. You can argue what songs should've been on their, but realistically it is what is, and I think they did a good job. <br /> <br />In regards to they whole Hagar/Roth issue, I'm glad they used Hagar for live Roth songs, because it shows that Van Halen can move on after Roth screwed them over. Sammy Hagar has one of the best voices in rock, and he performed those Roth songs great. Maybe they were rubbing it in Roth's face, but who cares, he won't come back to the band anyways, and Sammy Hagar is much better anyways. I just hope I can see Van Halen live with Hagar before they call it quits.
6305744793|3.0|I am a pretty big ''Addams family'' fan..the tv show is always good to watch if yer bored and I want to bang Morticia more than I have ever wanted to bang a woman in my life(The one from the tv show much more than the one in this movie!!)..inside a MORTUARY would be the best! I CAN DREAM!    Now the FIRST movie here is not that bad..Mortica look's hot, and all the charachter's are well represented. I just think they left out a lot of stuff that could have made it better!    If you just wanna be entertained but still get a sense of something REAL this is yer ticket..gotta love all the talking of past family member's being ''burned at the stake'' plus it rule's when they show how the other childern picked politician's as their hero's for a school project and Mortica goes ''Did you tell her parent's''LOL..good stuff, she then proceed's to talk of a past relative(Wensdays project) who ''danced naked in the village square and enslaved a priest''    The ''Addams family'' was not this dramatic..not meant to be, but this is still a fun movie!!

B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Troy is a great fun date film filled with exterior panorama shots that harken to the old David Lean Lawrence of Arabia views, and of course, Brad Pitt, who is buff enough to give a girl the vapors. Lordy! <br /> <br />However, for anyone who has ever read Homer, and has an iota of recognition of the Oddessey, the absence of the Greek gods is a major disappointment. Hollywood of course went for the love story between lesser characters to play up the roles of Orlando Bloom and Brad Pitt, and this was more an annoyance when actors with chops including Peter O'Toole were on screen. The Hollywood pretty boys looked decidedly underfed compared to the beefy Greek brothers of Sparta like Brian Cox, and at times this was an unexpected comical relief in fight scenes between the lithe Orlando Bloom as Paris and Agamemnon's kin.  It was not only laughable but cartoonish.  <br /> <br />The tender scenes between Hector and his wife and infant son were all but thrown out with the baby's bath water in this production as was the friendship between Achillies and Petrocles. Can't Hollywood just leave Homer alone if it wants to make a movie where a boy loves girl, girl runs away with the boy, and Greece goes after her with 50,000 extras. I enjoyed the spectacle, but missed the substance, however, Brad Pitt's pecs were a mighty rush of lust for the wide screen. Once Brad dropped his leather skirt, who cared!
B000B8QEYC|4.0|I am a huge Enya fan and have purchased everything she has ever released. Her soft vocal tone is as comfortable on the ears as anything can get. She has a superb sense of melody and Nicky Ryan is a wonderful producer. I have noticed on this album, though, as well as on its predecessor, a tendency for the arrangements to be less adventurous and not as diverse, intricate or complex than on, say, the Watermark or Shepherd Moons albums. It leaves me wanting and makes this album, by comparison, seem almost tired in spots. Please, Enya, rev up the spirit and give us another \\"Storms In Africa\\", \\"Orinoco Flow\\" or \\"Only If...\\" For this reason, I say this disc is almost, but not quite, there, and I give it 4 rather than 5 stars.
B00005JOFO|4.0|1963. Two loner cowboys show up at a small office in rural Montana looking for work. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) has worked for Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) before, and knows the routine. Take the flock of sheep up to Brokeback Mountain for the summer, watch over them, keep them safe, and return them at the end of the season. But Jack can't do the job alone and Joe hires Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger), a quiet, brooding fellow to run the base camp. Soon, the two men begin a relationship, finding companionship in each other's arms. At the end of the season, Jack thinks that maybe next year, or the year after, they can get a ranch together, and work it, making a nice life for themselves. Ennis is more concerned about public perception and reaction and can't make the jump into a relationship with Jack. Each gets married, Ennis to Alma (Michelle Williams) and Jack to Lureen (Anne Hathaway), and starts a family. One day, Jack rolls into town and the two lovers share a romantic weekend. Jack still wants them to run off together and start a ranch, but Ennis seems content to have these occasional weekends as he battles with his feelings about his true love.<br /><br />\\"Brokeback Mountain\\", directed by Ang Lee (\\"Sense and Sensibility\\", \\"The Ice Storm\\", \\"Hulk\\") and written by Larry McMurtry (\\"Lonesome Doves\\") and Diana Ossana, based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx, is a very good film, with a lot of great things going for it.<br /><br />Perhaps the best things about the film are the performances by the two leads, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. If you have read any of my reviews of previous Heath Ledger films (\\"The Brothers Grimm\\", \\"Lords of Dogtown\\", \\"A Knight's Tale\\"), you know I am not a huge fan. But in \\"Brokeback\\", he is able to create a fully realized character, a character we can believe in and identify with; from the first moments, when he can barely look anyone in the eye, to his gradual acceptance of his partner, to actually talking to Jack we see Ennis develop and grow before our eyes. As the relationship and their lives become more complicated, Ledger helps us understand why Ennis believes the way he does. The relationship he builds with Jack starts as a confused coupling due to need and grows into something more profound and deep, at least through Ennis' eyes. The character is very complicated, and interesting to watch, and a lot of this is due to Ledger's performance. Based on his previous work, I would never have believed he was capable of such a performance. It is intense, interesting and riveting.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is also very good. Jack seems to be the more accepting member of the couple; he seems to have an inkling of who he is and what he needs, before the night they share in the tent. When that happens, Jack is also concerned and confused, but his love for Ennis allows him to have fantasies of them starting a ranch together. He is clearly disappointed when this doesn't happen, but moves on, getting married to Lureen in the process. Quickly, we see Jack has married Lureen primarily for the lifestyle she affords; her dad owns a large farm equipment dealership. After this point, whenever Jack and Ennis get together for a \\"fishing weekend\\", it is clear Jack is the better off financially, but his heart is also breaking away because he can't be in a relationship with the man he truly loves. Gyllenhaal's performance is so good because it hints at things we never learn for sure. Has Jack had male partners before? Is Ennis his first love?<br /><br />Director Ang Lee has an impressive resume of films. Each film is very different, yet explores the common theme of a relationship between two people. If you look at his diverse group of films, you realize that he is willing to try to new things and (usually) does them very well. From Jane Austen's England, to New England in the 80s, from modern day San Francisco to modern day New York, he seems to have a real sense for the time and place in each film's narrative. Yes,he did make \\"Hulk\\", a misguided effort, to say the least, but his other films have been exemplary in every regard. He uses great actors, great writing and great cinematography to fully realize each film. \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is no exception. Equally stunning, equally challenging, and very different from his other films.<br /><br />The screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, based on a story by E. Annie Proulx, captures the dialogue of the time and place brilliantly. As mentioned, Ennis doesn't talk a lot and much of his dialogue is grunted, but when he does speak, it is easy to see his speech is subdued by confusion, upbringing and the morals of the day. Jack is more vocal, but also confused. His dreams of living a happy life with Ennis are all the more heartbreaking, because we realize they will never happen. In an interview on NPR, McMurtry and Ossana discussed adapting Proulx's story to the big screen, leaving much of her dialogue and description intact. What they added was an elaboration on the domestic life of Ennis and Jack, detailing what life is like for each when they aren't together. Ennis' life is the more captivating of the two because we recognize how troubled and horrible his life with Alma is. Alma isn't a bad person, but the life they build together is hard to watch. Perhaps the best moment in the film happens when Alma realizes what Jack and Ennis do on those \\"fishing trips\\".<br /><br />I think the one thing missing for me is any scene depicting the intimacy they share for one another. Their first coupling is more of a `wham, bam, thank you, man' type of encounter, in their tent during a cold night. Later, after they reunite, they kiss forcefully, due to hunger, yearning. Throughout the course of their relationship, which runs twenty years, we see them together a few times, but few of these portray the intimacy they must have shared. Yes, they hug; one scene even shows them in bed together, talking, yet, there seems to be a lack of intimacy. Even in the time and place, despite their confusion, they still manage moments alone, yet we don't really get a sense of the physical side of their love.<br /><br />\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a film filled with great performances, outstanding dialogue and beautiful cinematography.

0765340798|3.0|I find it interesting that many reviewers gave this book low rating because its a lightweight material. I see no reason to debate that since this book is relatively lightweight. But its also unfair to compared it to the complexity of Frank Herbert's works since I don't believed that was the authors' intent.<br /><br />This book is neither good as or bad as the first two books. All three books were basically lightweight materials. But I thought they were all pretty entertaining stuff that you can read for pure relaxation. Many people couldn't get into Frank Herbert's works because it was complex, deep and thought provoking. But these two authors who wrote the Legend of Dune series wrote for almost anyone who can read the English language. I think there is merit on that score.<br /><br />If you read the first two books in this series, then you know what to expect and I would strongly recommend that you will finish up the series. Battle of Corrin is a light reading material despite of its thickness in pages and it does tildy up the series. Beside, if you really didn't like these books, you would never read pass the first book anyway. I am sure that all these reviewers who gave this book one and two stars found themselves reading on because there is a quality within these pages. After all, after the first two books, how can you be surprised???
B000BMSTMS|5.0|How would one expect korn's sound to remain after the departure of Brian \\"Head\\" Welch (who i still respect greatly, even though he peaced). Korn was Jon Davis's weird vocal noises and voice, Munky and Heads interesting duo, Fieldy's clicky bass, and Dave busting out on the drums. Korn's sound was not centered on just the guitar duo. The band had a lot more depth than that. Of course with Head leaving they would have to change their sound. But i knew they would pull off a good album because they all have a unique contribution to the band. They are more industrial now. The duo consists of Munky and Fieldy now. They tear it up on the tracks Twisted Transistor, Politics, Coming Undone, Liar, and It's Me Again. Dave's drums have a more industrial rock sound to it. Jon's voice is even weirder which definitely works with this industrial rock feel. They have changed, and it is amazing that they have pulled it off so well. Congrats Korn. As for Head, I wish only the best for him. Korn would not have been able to make this transition so smoothly without his previous influence. Peace.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|OK, so if price is an object perhaps you should buy episode by episode but, I must say that this boxset is a must for fans of the show. Nice job! Although I can see where some of the reviewers are put off by certain aspects of the show, for instance the fact that the woman portrayed here are strong minded, sexy in their own ways without always being 'made up'  and speaking frankly as most do in an open minded world amongst friends when men aren't around...especially if you are from some po-dunk, bible thumping backwater town where they teach intelligent design as part of the science class in school..( gotta love non working PTA moms with time on their hands and a head full of Jesus!) That said, and you know who you are and why you shouldn't be allowed to view this show. I usually buy most items off Amazon and find that they have the best price but, in this instance, I found a better price at Costco. $170.00!!! Next best is Amazon though. Long story short and my mindless blog out of the way, buy this collection. Nice packaging, quality box set, and alas a must have for fans and even partial fans who enjoyed the show before but were not loyal weekly watchers. Watching episode by episode on your own timetable rather than HBO's ( for workin' folk like myself who were not available every week) will get you re-hooked right back in. My girlfriend loved it for a present and I suspect most will, exception being if you are friends with the bitter female reviewer below but, her boyfriend is most likely her brother and she is still mad that he took her to the prom! Enjoy your boxset kids, the extra's alone are really worth it and that is half the reason we buy DVD's anyway right?.
0307263118|5.0|I loved this book for its lyricism, and the courage of its literariness\\". Banville is an important writer, one well-desrving the Booker Prize. He is not afraid to plunge into still, quiet moments of human consciousness.  A truly powerful work.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Take two parts Nancy Drew, a dash of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", throw in a cup of \\"Rockford Files\\"...ah, forget the lame metaphor and watch \\"Veronica Mars\\" the freshest  TV drama in the past two years.    In the first episode Veronica's world has been turned upside down by the death of her best friend Lilly Kane, daughter to multi millionaire Jake Kane. It is Jake who Veronica's dad pursues as the killer of Lilly. He's the local sheriff, but it's a position he doesn't hold much longer when the Kane's fortune and influence force him from his job. The ensuing scandal  breaks up the Mars family. Ultimately Veronica and her dad are forced to go it alone. They stay afloat by manning a small detective agency in town. Veronica goes from popular to outcast as her life and status falls apart. A late night party seals her reputation as the high school tramp, a party that Veronica has very little memory of.    Through out the season Veronica redefines herself as she moves from case to case, often working for the very students who shun her. Her office is the high school girls bathroom and her best friend is her smarts, an ability that keeps her one step ahead of  her rivals.    Who killed Lilly Kane? Where's Veronica's mom? What really happened at that party? These are just a few of the mysteries Veronica confronts through the first season of this wonderfully crafted show.    The acting is far above average from what one might expect in a weekly TV show. Enrico Colantoni , Veronica's dad, is barely recognizable from his days on \\"Just Shoot Me\\". Kristen Bell, Jason Dohring, and Harry Hamlin also shine in their well defined roles. The writing too is more than we deserve. It is clever and full of wit.  Only twice was I able to solve the mysteries presented by the show before Veronica, and then only by a few seconds. The themes that the show explores, class structure and teen angst being the most predominate, are familiar but fresh. This is more that just \\"90210\\" meets \\"Columbo\\".It is not a hybrid show, though it's easy to describe it as one. No, \\"Veronica Mars\\" is completely original.
B000002N9L|4.0|Prince's 1996 kiss-off to Warner Brothers holds up rather well compared to the more hyped recordings of his career. \\"Chaos and Disorder\\" has relatively few misfires and some truly memorable tracks: \\"I Like It There,\\" \\"Dinner With Delores,\\" \\"Right the Wrong,\\" \\"Into the Light\\" and the appropriately melancholy \\"Had U.\\" The overall album rocks harder than Prince's recent work.
B000062Y44|5.0|This is the fourth BDB album I've bought and it's simply an amazingly brillant piece of musicianship. I've listened to this album a ridiculous amount of times and I never cease to enjoy every song on here. BDB finds a perfect balance mixing quirky  instrumental tracks with an equal number of wonderful vocal pieces, creating an album rarely surpassed by musicians today. With enticing lyrics and catchy tunes, the soundtrack to \\"About a Boy\\" will please its buyers and delight any who take a moment to listen to BDB work his magic.

B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead veered off the paved road of the music world's expectations (and maybe some fans), but in doing so, they concocted a blend of tracks that are simply beautiful.  The melodies are orchestral, almost like a Motion Picture Soundtrack (he he).   <br /> <br />My favorite tracks off this album are: \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\", \\"How To Disappear Completely\\", \\"Optimistic\\", \\"Morning Bell\\", and \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\".  The bass riff on \\"National Anthem\\" is so incredible - it deserves a Grammy just for the riff.   <br /> <br />Some fans were disappointed in not having OK Computer Part II, but I love the new direction.  Original, variety, etc.  Bravo!
B000001EKX|5.0|This album is one of Kiss' best. The songs are well written (for the most part - barring the usual KISS cheese factor) Ace's solos are some of his best, the emotive quality of Gene's backing vocals (check out \\"got to choose\\") will bring you to your knees. There seems to be a general consensus about the production and that it is somehow of inferior quality. I can't help but wonder with what template these people are measuring? I can, to some degree, understand why people might say this but ultimately this viewpoint is the sentiment of the amateur audiophile.<br />There is a lot of production gold to be extracted if you know how to listen. The quality is very unique (vs. poor). It was probably done on the cheap, sure BUT if that is the case, what was created - by most probably overlapping demo tracks with \\"cleaner\\" tracks - manifested one of the MOST unique sounding rock albums in existence... nothing I have ever heard sounds anything like it. And whatever \\"it\\" is, I want more!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I'm in a pickle, as with any movie biography. If I say I enjoyed the film and learned something, then there will always be the \\"experts\\" who will say how much the movie got wrong or how some things were emphasized at the expense of other, perhaps more important, things. So all I'm going to say is that I enjoyed watching this film, and I think Joaquin and Reese did a great job \\"impersonating\\" Johnny and June. I've never been a fan of Cash, but I liked listening to the songs here, and I wanted more singing. The romance between Johnny and June, with all its warts and faults, was touching as well. Even \\"bad, messed up\\" people (i.e. people who make lots of stupid mistakes) can work things out, it seems.
B00005JNX0|5.0|I got this movie for my 2 and a half year old daughter. She absolutly loves it!!  It's one of her favorite movies and mine as well.  It has jokes for kids and adults.  We watch it all the time and we still seem to see something new, a joke, a character doing something funny or even just the beautiful things in the scenes.  If you'reon the fence about buying this dvd, hop over to the owners side.
B000002AVF|5.0|Quite simply the best Mariah album EVER... Daydream was where we saw the real, raw Mariah as her cross from pop sensation to RnB diva was complete. There really is somethign 4 everyone on here! <br />The amazing Fantasy opens up the album with its amazing bass line and incredible lyrics (10/10).  Underneath the stars, similar to 1997's Butterfly, is also an amazing track with an oldy feel.  One Sweet Day, a collabaration with boyz II Men is powerful as is Open Arms where Mariah's powerful vocals will invade your eardrums.  All of these songs desrve nothing but a 10/10. <br />Always be my baby (10/10) is one of her most popular tracks and is true RnB.  I am Free is one of the most emotional songs on the record with the haunting piano and vocals sending a ashover down your spine. <br />When I Saw You is an epic ballad and really deifnes the tone of the album, again 10/10.  Forever is quite simply Mariah's best song on this album. Her vocals are amazing and the 1950's style music adds to the romance of the song. <br />Melt Away and Long Ago are also well worthy of a 10/10 although they weren't singles as is Looking In which is quite simply a mellow ballad - Mariah Style. <br />The Daydream Interlude would be the only downer on the album - it is good, but doesnt fit in with the atmospheres created by the other ballads and RnB hits with its dancey feel. <br />Overall, quite simply the best Mariah album ever- go get it!
B000002OK3|4.0|If there's one thing I must give Quentin Tarantino high marks for is putting together some amazing soundtracks that both make for great listening and complement the film. After I'd first seen \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" (far later than every other decent movie-loving person on the planet), it struck me as being a good film with the potential to be truly great after several more viewings. I already knew it was going to become one of my top favorite movies of all time. But what gave it that special kick -- besides the simple but tight plot, the incredible actors, and the love of my life Steve Buscemi (did I just type that out loud...?) -- was the music. And even before I learned to fully appreciate the movie, I wanted -- no, *needed* -- the soundtrack. The songs weren't extraneous or inappropriate, but they effectively punctuated, underlined, and italicized certain scenes and made them even more memorable and meaningful than they would've been without the aural enhancements. As opposed to just random musical sounds laid over a scene, they actually fit in and occasionally lent some commentary if you think about it.     I can listen to this soundtrack over and over (much like the \\"Pulp Fiction\\" soundtrack) and it's almost like reliving another layer of the movie. It also has the eclecticism of a free-form radio show, thanks to Steven Wright's \\"DJ\\"-ing. Okay, so this CD short. Okay, so some of the songs have been played to death already (did anybody catch the stupid Coke commercials that totally ruined the \\"Coconut\\" song? Feh...). It still works as a whole, film dialogue and DJ bits included.
076790592X|5.0|Once in a while we come across a teacher who unexpectedly changes our life. Based on a true-life non-fiction story, Tuesday with Morrie, written by Mitch Albom, a former college student of Morrie Schwartz deserves a five star rating. It is a beautiful story about love and veneration to the teacher with a lot of sincerity which influence on one's life. The book is  extraordinary because the fact that it records the last lectures about the main issues in life such as love, culture, family, forgiveness, marriage and death. There lectures were given by professor Morrie, who was dying because of disease called Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, for his formerly favorite student who recorded the sessions on every Tuesday. While this book has some good themes, which are based on wisdom and true life, some things were not revealed, like the relationship between his wife and sons and how close his comradeship was with his student Mitch Albom; nevertheless, readers of all ages are able to become vicarious witness to lessons regarding the meaning of life.  Through an educational speech in the book and Morrie, the main character I have learned how to live a full life and how to avoid fearing it. Morrie is very loving, open with his emotion and not afraid to show his sensitive side. Even though his condition gradually gets worse and worse, he is not afraid of death and is active to the end of his life as a great teacher, friend and coach. He never feels sorry for himself but is grateful to be surrounded by friends and loving people. He is utterly dependent on them because they feed him, clothe him, and wash him, but he is not ashamed of it. Throughout the book, Morrie gives generously of his time, explaining the meaning of life. His friends and family are very important because to live life fully he needs their support, love, care and security. He is reminded about some truths, which are getting away from him in daily rush of living. He is concerned about an extremely important thing: the truth about how important forgiveness is, and our culture and where it is necessary to find guideposts to happiness.  Because the book focuses only on conversations, which provide significant wisdom and insight about life and death between teacher and student, the author separates us from the group of relatives which faces the agonizing and fatal disease of a member of their family. Although Morrie talks a lot about the importance of family, showing his values to the new generations, he scarcely introduces us to his children. He does not tell if they are married or have children of their own. Also, his affections and attachment to his wife, her view on his illness, and her pain are not shared with the reader. One more aspect which demands urgent explanation is that Mitch Album had only fourteen Tuesday meetings with Morrie, many of which were recorded. I believe that Mitch had bigger heartwarming experiences in his past, but he does not interpret them through this book to give us more pages and more sentiments about the closer relationship with his teacher.  Indeed, Tuesdays with Morrie is a thoughtful and sensitively written book, and every reader can find value in it. The book is read in one breath, with emotion and impatience; we are eagerly waiting for the following page and every word, which reaches the innermost nooks of the soul. It causes people to reflect on themselves and their lives, allowing them to cure a lot of doubts and sadness and remind them of what is the most important for them. The power comes from the fact that not only a Morrie a dying professor, but also a wise man who is able to value his life to the end of his time.  This book gives a whole new viewpoint on our life about what makes us happy, strong, sensitive, brave and independent. Throughout Morrie's lessons, Mitch changes his life rapidly, finding the meaning of his life, starting to love again, sacrificing himself to others and giving himself goals for his existence. I would recommend reading this book for everyone who is looking for a prescription for its life or who would like to compare his experience with a great teacher in the world. I am thankful to Morrie for lessons about a life, happiness and wisdom. I hope that some values which I got from him will become my goal and I will follow them through my whole life.
B0007CNXUU|5.0|I LOVED this movie. I have seen it several times and my friends and family also agree that it is a beautiful love story about fantasy and friendship. It is close to impossible to not cry through this amazing movie. It's perfect for people who are still children at heart.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I see myself as one of those Clapton \\"purists\\" who thought 1)his move to Fender Stratocasters and 2)his solo material after Derek and the Dominoes, did not compare to Cream, and his brief stint in John Mayall's band.  I felt cheated buying his pop albums of the mid to late 80's (remember \\"Forever Man\\"?), as well as his synthetic/plastic blues albums of the early to mid 90's. From this period, I thought \\"Unplugged\\" was the exception. Aside from the death of his son, with the song that he wrote in tribute, Clapton was to me a souless, clinical guitar player.   <br /> <br />Then I received the \\"Concert for George\\" DVD for X-mas two years ago.  When I saw Clapton pour his heart into that tribute concert for his friend (George Harrison), I knew there was still some life left in him.  Especially the solo for \\"My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", which brings back the old Clapton solo phrasing, something I had not heard in years.   <br /> <br />Because of that concert/DVD, I was optimistic about how Clapton would play for a Cream reunion that came to reality 5/05. I must say I'm not in the least disappointed with this performance.  While many think a 60 year old Clapton, a 66 year old Baker, and a 62 year old Bruce are going to play with the same energy 36 years later is dreaming.  Clapton's Leslie/Fender tube amp setup with his custom Strat is a beefy combination that fits well with Bruce's new Hartke bass amps.  <br /> <br /> <br />When I watch this DVD I realize Bruce needed Clapton, and vice versa.  They feed off each other and compete to improve through every jam/solo. Clapton plays with an inspiration I haven't heard in years (if not ever), while Bruce is always trying to edge ahead of Eric on the shorter but not weaker jams of the 2005 edition. \\"Sweet Wine\\" is the one song/jam that reminds me of Cream of the past.  That song is worth the price of this DVD alone.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BM6AVA|5.0|This is a must have. However you need to purchase this with Mezmerize, if you don't already have it, to get the complete experience.

B00001OH7T|3.0|One of my least-favorite Bowie albums.  Young Americans starts off okay with the title track and then heads into strange waters from there.  His version of Across The Universe (with John Lennon) and Fame are okay.  Spectacular?  F*ck no!  For those who think this is prime Bowie, they're either lightly into Bowie or have no idea how Bowie should be.  For those who need a refresher course, The Man Who Sold The World, Ziggy Stardust & Hunky Dory ought to bring you around to realizing what tripe Young Americans is.  Bummer.<br /><br />Dig it!
B00082ZS5W|5.0|I had heard DIDO on the radio, but never could get her name. I read somebody else's review here in Amazon, and I'm glad that I got this DVD, which to my surprise, included also a CD.<br /><br />Dido Armstrong can not only sing and write her songs, but she can really perform on stage. She is just simply beautiful and her looks, talent writing and singing reminded me of a young Christie McVie, when the later performed as a founding member of Fleetood Mac in the 1970's.<br /><br />This live DVD performance is sensual, well recorded with excellent camera works, and does the work to capture Dido performing in a very natural and lose setting. Quite frankly, I didn't know what to expect when I initially bought this DVD, other than being an Amazon review referral, but am I ever glad I bought it. It's in top of my extensive collection of live concert performances which captures the very best of what a live concert should be all about. Play it out in Dolby 5.1 surround. Enjoy!
B00000FCBC|5.0|After 1984's Garage Days Revisited on the Creeping Death 12\\" single & 1987's Garage Days Re-Revisited, Metallica has done a bunch of covers here and there that were never really collected, and unless you wanted to fork out the coin for the imports and the EPs and all that (...) you were basically assed out.  Well, along comes Garage Inc.<br /><br />The 2-dics compilation of old and new covertunes.  All the old (...) is here from Blitzkrieg and Am I Evil? to Last Caress/Green Hell & Crash Course In Brain Surgery.  All here.  Along the way of planning this effort that I'm sure diehard fans had been clammoring for for years, Jaymz and the Metallifux decided to record some new stuff for the effort as well.<br /><br />Standouts include Sabbath's \\"Sabra Cadabra\\" with a slice of \\"A National Acrobat\\" thrown in.  Bob Seger's \\"Turn The Page\\".  The Mercyful Fate Medley which is just so (...)funny in all it's satanic, witchcraft, sell-your-soul metal goodness.  Thin Lizzy's \\"Whiskey In The Jar\\" became a smash hit.  And Blue Oyster Cult's \\"Astronomy\\" was pretty cool.  I can't figure out why they put live all-star bash version of \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" cause it hella-sux.  Otherwise, this is quite a bit of Metallica and a lot of hella-cool tunes for the price.<br /><br />Dig it!
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Every Depeche Mode fan will argue their favorite phase in the career of DM.  For me it is the early to mid 90's.  Violator, (my all time fave), and Songs of Faith & Devotion are stellar!  Playing the Angel reminds me of those albums and therefore, I love it.  This album is dark and moody, danceable at times, a little electronic and a little orchestral.  It is everything I love about Depeche Mode. <br /> <br />      Typically I am least impressed by the singles from an album.  \\"Precious\\" is the exception.  This is an excellent track.  It is Depeche Mode right from the start and Dave Gahan's ethereal voice has never sounded better.  The lyrics are beautiful.  It is a well produced track. <br /> <br />      Popular opinion is that \\"Damaged People\\" is the worst track on this album.  I disagree.  I am intrigued by this song.  The song starts with a sort of broken caliope playing a fractured melody and it continues throughout the track.  Some are disturbed by this but I find it inventive and unexpected.  The first time I listened to this song I found it familiar and thought that DM might be covering a song.  I read the album sleeve to learn it was a DM original though.  Upon another listen I realized the the melody on the chorus is the same as \\"I Don't Know How to Love Him\\" from Jesus Christ Superstar.  Has anyone else noticed this or is everyone just too ashamed to admit that they listen to show tunes! <br /> <br />     Depeche Mode fans will love this album and even non fans will apreciate it as well.
B000002H2H|5.0|The division between Kill 'Em All and Ride The Lightning is huge.  The albums sound like two different bands.  Amazing.  Where KEA was juvenile and garage-bandish, Ride The Lightning was the polished effort.  Don't get me wrong, a lot of great songs came from KEA, but Ride The Lightning is better.  Fight Fire With Fire opens up the album (back when it was an actual album) and never looks back!  Absolute pure shred!  Ride The Lightning, Creeping Death, Fade To Black, & For Whom The Bell Tolls!  All Classics!  Their first really professional effort for Electra, with the final batch of Dave Mustaine co-written tunes. Clearly one of the greatest metal albums of all time.<br /><br />Dig it!
0307276902|3.0|I picked up this book in the airport in Atlanta during a layover.  I was interested in it because I too am in recovery, and I was desperate for something to read. Once I got started, I couldn't put the book down, but I think the author might have hyped stuff up to keep the reader's attention. Everyone's story of recovery is different, but not everyone writes a book and gets picked for the Oprah book club. <br /> <br />The real testament is to see if James Frey can stay sober through all the hype and money made from this book.
B000063COX|4.0|In the early 80s heavy metal was something that was still being defined.  Coming off the hard rock acts of the 70s (Zeppeling, The Who, Sabbath), the 80s was a period of experimentation, aggression, and extremes.  While new bands were sprouting up everywhere, and the talented were pulling apart from the rest of the pack.  Young upstarts like Britain's fiery Iron Maiden were laying down the groundwork for the invasion of British Metal.  With Bassist Steve Harris in charge of most of the writing, Iron Maiden knew how to rock and rock hard, yet they still managed to pull off the slower tunes.  Singer Paul DiAnno could wail in a strange way, though he was a boozer and a layabout and would soon be expunged from the band.  Original guitarist Dave Murray and soon to be ousted Dennis Statton lay down the licks.  Clive Burr pounds the skins.  The refreshing thing about Iron Maiden, aside from the over-the-top covers done by Derek Riggs and their immortal mascot Eddie, was their raw power and sheer energy.  Dark themes abound. Their debut is filled with explosive solos, edgy riffs, and pounding, pumbing bass lines. The talent leaks through from the depths of their horror movie genius.  From the first listen way back when, you could tell right away that Iron maiden was going to be around for a long time to come.  Let's check out the songs!<br /><br />Prowler - The opening riff is killer.  This is a great song filled with excitement.  You can already tell from the opening song that they are a tight band and that they have practicing quite a bit.  The electricity is apparent.  Walking through the city, looking oh so pretty,  I've just got to find my way....<br /><br />Sanctuary - Another early Maiden gem that rocks incredibly hard.  Great, infectious lyrics.  DiAnno wails here.  This is pure metal mayhem.  Now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law!  Excellent!<br /><br />Remember Tomorrow - The cool thing about early Maiden was that they could take a step or two back and come out with a slower tune that still rocked out loud.  Remember Tomorrow is one of those songs that you will never forget.  Great in composition.  DiAnno's vocals shine.  Complex and mystical.  Perfect.<br /><br />Running Free - The pumping drums along with Steve Harris' bass line make this an instant classic and one of my personal all-time Maiden favorites.  I love this song.  The lyrics are kinda cheesy, but it is so filled with hooks that you can help but sing along.  Killer!<br /><br />Phantom Of The Opera - This is where the boys in the band show off how well they can each play their instruments.  Steve Harris was like the bass player from Hell when this came out because he was so f*cking good it was scary.  The twin guitar attack of Murray and Stratton (though not for long) works better than Schenker & Jabs or Tipton & Downing. This is a longer, more multi-layered song that the rest of the album and it shows the musicianship that went into recording this album.  Superior.<br /><br />Transylvania - Great instrumental track that just absolutely wails.  Kick out the jams, this is Maiden unleashed!<br /><br />Strange World - I've been listening to this album for so long that it's hard for me to find fault in any of its songs.  Strange World is another of the slower tunes from the early Maiden repitoire, and I think it's great.  DiAnno sounds kinda strange (no pun intended) here, but it still rocks.<br /><br />Charlotte The Harlot - Years later they would continue the story of Charlotte on 22 Acacia Avenue, but for now this is the original.  Charlotte The Harlot show me your legs, Charlotte The Harlot take me to bed.  The lyrics are kinda corny, but the song is grooving.  Goes through some weird key changes, and the middle is soft.  Might be the weakest spot on the album...then again, there might not be a weak spot here.<br /><br />Iron Maiden - The riff is ingrained in my soul.  Straight-ahead metal.  The world, wherever, wherever you are  Iron Maiden's gonna getyou, no matter how far...  Perfect ending to a nearly perfect debut album.<br /><br />Overall, this was what Heavy Metal was back in the very early 80s.  Aggressive, pushy, exciting!  Iron Maiden came out with an absolutely awe-inspiring debut album from the depths of obscurity.  The definition of metal, Maiden be thy name.<br /><br />Dig it!lbum.

B0007TB38C|4.0|I've never quite understood why this mid-1990s album (sorry, CD...I'm dating myself there)has wound up all but vanishing from the Tull canon.  I bought it when it came out and saw Ian & Co. on the supporting tour--in Pensacola, FL--and thought the music was expert and interesting--clearly a move by Tull into the world-music arena.  Standout cuts: \\"Rare and Precious Chain\\", which is a Morrocan-feeling \\"Kashmir\\"-style composition; the title cut \\"Roots To Branches\\", which is also heavy-riff stuff in the minor key, and the funky, muscular \\"Out Of The Noise\\", which features some superb Martin Barre distorted angular guitar.  I dock the album one star, in retrospect, for being a little unfocused, particularly some of the slower songs, which tend to ramble--although Anderson/Tull rambling a bit is a hundred times more interesting than Green Day sawing away on three unmusical chords while shrieking incoherently.  Guess I'm showing my age, because I really don't get it.  Give me the chops, musical intelligence, clarity, and creativity of Tull any time--of which \\"Roots To Branches\\" is a fine example.  Oh, yeah...It also rocks out.  Excellent album, firmly recommended.
B00001OH7U|3.0|Reading reviews that rave about Station To Station as Bowies most brilliant effort?  Are you people f*cking mad?  Station To Station is so far from Bowie's best that it's inconceivable that people would cater to its scatter-shot elements.  The title track is cool and Golden Years is a Bowie staple, but that is where the brilliance ends and we're only two songs into the an album that only boasts six tracks (two bonus on the Ryko version still don't add much).  This is the coked-out maniac Bowie trying to reinvent himself.  This is megalomaniac Bowie in a mental institutuion, smearing himself with excrement and giggling like The Joker in Arkham Asylum.  This is sorcerer-paranoid Bowie masturbating and people applauding his maudlin efforts.  Bowie is spiritually crushed here with all the terrible & derranged things going on in his life and and you can hear it in his voice.  He is laughing at the fact that he has run out of really cool material and this tripe he has come up with being accepted as legit.  Unreal.  Well...for those of you who think that Station To Station is Bowie at his finest, most thought-provoking brilliance....wow.  Surrounded by f*cking idiots!  At this point in time, Bowie is in his disintegrating marriage, freaked out on cocaine, and worrying about dark sorcerers puting the jinx on him.  He is fighting the homosexual personna he created.  He is dealing with the life of a burned-out rock legend.  On tour, he makes his band play behind a curtain so that he is the only one visible on stage.  He is whacked out and hellaciously unhappy and it shows on Station To Station.  This is constipated Bowie and we should rebuke it for being a holdover album until Low comes at us.  Enough said.<br /><br />Deal with it!
0307276902|2.0|Does anyone else think it's wrong that James Frey didn't serve time for the crimes he committed before he went into rehab? His mob and judge friends got him off the hook--enabling him to serve 6 months in jail instead of several years in prison. While this book was a page turner, I find it disturbing that we're glorifying (and making rich) a guy who jumped the system. He may even have been a murderer--something he never clarifies. I would respect James had he served the consequences for what he did, and actually shown some remorse for his disgusting behavior. To me, that's as much a part of rehab as getting off the substances. Instead, he wrote 22 pages of his \\"sins\\" and then burned them--I guess that was his payment? But this is a guy who thinks he's above everything, including the rehab program he was in. He really is his own God. People like that scare me, and it scares me that our culture is so oblivious.
0743424425|5.0|You wanna know what scary is? Well..I could think of a few dozen books that'll scare the crap out of most people.  Clive Barker's Books Of Blood,  The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty is pretty cool, and The Summer Of Night by Dan Simmons can raise a goosebump or fifty at times.  But one of the all-time chillers had got to be The Shining.  It's creepy on so many levels that most people couldn't read it at night without feeling some kind of superstitious voodoo working on their nerves.  Written all the way back in 1977, The Shining by Stephen King and the movie by Stanley Kubrick starring Jack Nicholson often get intermixed.  Well, Kubrick based the movie loosley on King's novel (King redid The Shining some years back as a TV miniseries the right way) but the classic chiller remains in our mind.  Hard to shake Jack Nicholson's visage from our mind's eye as we read of the reformed alcoholic father Jack Torrence trying to keep his family together and make everything good again.  Hard to put out the visions of axe-wielding maniacs and rivers of blood.  In its essential form, King's The Shining is more ghost story and psychological thriller than Kubrick's blood-drenched outing. The Overlook Hotel, where the Torrence's intend to spend the winter as caretakers has a sinister life of its own, and it wants Danny Torrence, who has The Shine, a great little gift of clairvoyance, and it will do anything it can to get him, including driving his father insane.  Full of twists and turns and great gulps of heebie-jeebie.  The Shining is one of the better examples of King's work and the horror novel in general.  Enjoy it, but you might want to keep an extra light on.<br /><br />Dig it!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I bought American Idiot in September 2004 when it first came out, then again in October 2004, and once again in Novemeber 2004. Why did I buy this album three times? Because after the album \\"Shenanigans\\" was released I (A loyal Green Day fan since I was about 7) thought it was all over, punk rock was dead and was not expecting such an amazing album, that I needed to make sure I had the correct CD.  <br /> <br />The album not only has fantastic music and lyrics but has a phenomenal rock opera story line underneath it all. Only two tracks in my personal opinion are not amazing (Whatsername and Give Me Novacaine) everything else screams \\"BEST GREEN DAY ALBUM EVER\\"  <br /> <br />I'm not one to say DONT LET YOUR KIDS LISTEN TO THIS trust me cause I myself am young but some materials can be found objectionable by parents so check this out before you let your kids listen to this.  <br /> <br />American Idiot is the greatest Green Day album ever and finally they will not be known as the band that made \\"Dookie\\" and instead the band that revolutionized punk rock with punk rocks first opera and also as the leading punk rock band of all time, American Idiot makes it official.
B00001OH7V|4.0|Here we have more experimental David Bowie and Brian Eno and it seemes to be getting better and stranger.  Beauty And The Beast opens the album with a hook, moving into Joe The Lion & finally into \\"Heroes\\".  Sons of the Silent Age is a cool tune before the second-half experimentation gets all instrumental.  A little better than Low, Bowie is going out on a limb here with weirdness, but it seems to work.  Just not forever.  Worth the listen.<br /><br />Dig it!
B00005JO04|5.0|Everything is about oil, one way or another in this movie and this movie packs a wallop. George Clooney (From Dusk Till Dawn, Solaris), brilliant as ever here, plays Bob Barnes, a CIA Agent who is used by the CIA for the war on Middle East terrorism. The very start of this movie sucks you in and when that bomb goes off, it gets better and better as it goes along.. Clooney even gets kidnapped in one scene, gagged, rolled into a bag and the he is tortured by getting his fingernails pulled out..wow. Matt Damon (The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy), in another great performance and makes up for his damn horrid role in Brothers Grimm, plays Bryan Underwood, an Energy Analyst who has two sons and a wife Julie, played by Amanda Peet (Something's Gotta Give, Saving Silverman). Damon gets invited to the house of two princes and their father, one Prince being Nasir, played by Alexander Siddig (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Reign Of Fire) in a superb performance, and at this party Damon loses one of his sons....so Damon uses this to get into business with Prince Nasir. There's a intense scene where Clooney flags dog Prince Nasir on a highway...it'll blow you away. Meanwhile, Bennett Holiday, played by a knockout Jeffrey Wright (Shaft, Ride With the Devil), is a lawyer who is trying to merge to Texas Oil Companies, the big one Connex and the Small one Killen, which is run by Chris Cooper (Jarhead, Adaptation). The cinematography and landscapes are fantastic and they look beautiful on film and Gaghan gives another great masterpiece. One of the best movies of the year. Syriana blazes. Also starring Christopher Plummer (The New World, National Treasure), William Hurt (A History Of Violence, Changing Lanes) and Tim Blake Nelson (Minority Report, O Brother Where Art Thou?)
B00001OH7P|5.0|Hands down one of the greatest rock albums of all time!  Earlier efforts from Bowie always left something unsaid...but not here.  The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust is perfect.  Having discovered Bowie late in life...I was like two years old when Ziggy was released, I was turned on to him by a friend some ten or fifteen years ago.  Once I had purchased a few albums like The Man Who Sold The World and Hunky Dory I was hooked on Bowie and eventually ended up buying everything he ever released.  But Ziggy is the standout.  Diamond Dogs comes close and The Man Who Sold The World is great but Ziggy has it all.  Standouts include Five Years, Moonage Daydream, Starman, Soul Love, Ziggy Stardust & Suffragette City.  Listen to this first and you wind up becoming a Bowie junkie.  You won't be able to help it.  Bowie is an addiction.<br /><br />Dig it!
0307263118|5.0|It is no easy thing to pinpoint the precise moment when a life changes, when the different things a man might do are rendered impossible.    In THE SEA, winner of the 2005 Man Booker Prize for Fiction, narrator Max Morden returns to the seaside spot where he spent his holidays as a boy. He comes back to mourn his wife, dead of cancer, contemplate his own death, and remember the incidents of a certain summer. Impressively, the novel tacks in two directions at once, capturing the beginning of Max's life and the near end with equal poignancy.    In the beginning, Max was an unhappy, lonely boy, embarrassed by his poverty and the unending squabbles of his mother and soon-to-depart father. He attaches himself to the Grace family, glamoured by the differences between their family and his own, and smitten with the women: Connie Grace, the seductive mother; Rose, the black-haired governess; and Chloe, fearless twin to the creepily silent Myles. They are fascinating, not for anything they do but simply for who they are, and John Banville has such a way with telling details that Max's recollections of a family on the brink of tragedy are almost painfully vivid.    In the end, Max is an art critic, immersed in mourning and self-loathing. His pain does not soften him at all toward his own daughter, whom he dismisses with condescension and unwitting cruelty. Nor does it dim his descriptive powers. The empty seaside town, his rundown hotel, even his fellow guests, do not escape his notice. Max is fascinated by one of his fellow guests, a retired military man; he details his schedule, clothes, and eating habits as if he sees him as a stand-in for himself so he does not have to face his own frailty.    It's hard to find a review of any of John Banville's works that fails to mention the beauty of his writing. He's certainly in top form here, relating Max's experiences with the Grace family in a way that captures his innocence and his misunderstanding and shocks the reader with the immediacy of the tragedy. The effects of Max's early summer never stop resonating, and he never really grows up. His stunted adolescence hardly could be plainer than when he realizes that he is not the only one whose life was altered forever.         --- Reviewed by Colleen Quinn ([...])
B00001OH7O|4.0|Overall and inspired effort by Bowie.  Hunky Dory is one of his pre-Ziggy albums that contained a slew of great songs and showed us that, yes, Mr. Bowie had some great ideas.  Standouts include Oh! You Pretty Things, the ever classic Changes, Life On Mars? & one of my personal favorites Andy Warhol.  Solid effort.  Nearly perfect, but not quite. Bowie still had a ways to go.
1400031087|1.0|I think this book was total bogus. maybe parts was true but this doesn't happen in the real world.  <br />It was interesting fiction.
0451169514|5.0|This is, hands down, my favorite Stephen king novel of all time.  I re-read it at least once a year because it is that good.  There are many who would probably disagree that this is King's finest hour, but I gotta tell, having read it all, they're wrong.  Sure The Stand is great, and 'Salem's Lot, The Shining, and The Dead Zone are up there with his best.  But...IT.  Is there anything but perfection in this huge, lumbering beast of a novel.  I think not.  Kink kicks out all the stops on this one and lets loose with a history lesson in evil.  Stretching between 1958 and 1985, and beyond in both directions, IT crafts the story of a group of misfits pitted against the ultimate evil in the ever-changing shape of Pennywise the clown.  It soars in broad directions, taking us where we don't want to go to see things we don't want to see.  Steve-O really outdoes himself here.  I remember toting the hardboack around High School when it first came out back in '86.  I was hooked then at 16 and I'm still hooked now.  Timeless and enchanting. The story is so interwoven that you feel you're going to get lost, and yet you keep right on going.  Filled with bullies and werewolves and child-killers and terrible dreams, IT takes the reader on the wildest ride of their life. This is The Lord Of The Rings of horror.  Without a doubt IT will remain my personal favorite and one of King's very best works!  Read IT and be afraid...very afraid.
B000BVEKO0|1.0|Ok, have been a fan of Korn since Follow the leader. <br />After hearing this album trough many times, i cant get why the sudden change. They are some mean riffs to head bang to, buy why Jonathan begins to sing these pop pitch i dont know. Korn used to be mean, aggresive. Where you could put some anger in. Now you can dance to it on the dance floor. Everytime Korn puts out an album.. its supposed to be \\"heaviest to date\\" after Issues it has become the opposite. As they put it in the Twisted Transitor : Rock is dead ? Well, if you make music like this, it is.
B000063DFQ|5.0|As Bruce Dickinson and the Maiden boys got acquainted after The Number Of The Beast, things began to change a little at a time.  First off, Clive Burr exits the band and Nicko McBrain takes over on drums.  Then they head to the studio for the follow up to the great album that had transpired before.  Now, Bruce Dickinson starts to get into the business of writing the material.  Where it was mostly Steve Harris penning the tunes before, now there is outside help from their frontman.  Does Piece Of Mind suffer because of this?  Perhaps it does, but we don't notice that much because it's filled with Maiden classics.  After Killers and Number Of The Beast, the Maiden sound was cemented, and after a while it's gonna start to wear us down, but not quite yet.  Let's look at the songs:<br /><br />Where Eagles Dare -  Good opener along the lines of Invaders or Aces High.  This is a rocking tune, just not one of their absolute best efforts.  Bruce's voice is a little whiny here.  Still, better than filler.  Solid, just not exceptional.<br /><br />Revelations -  This song is excellent.  The lyrics are tight and literate and Dickinson proves that he's no slouch when it comes to writing.  Sounds very reminiscent of Children Of The Damned.  A true rocker.<br /><br />Flight Of Icarus - Greek mythology, Maiden, metal!  This is definitely a Maiden classic.  One of those songs that you can't help but singing along with.  Perfect.<br /><br />Die With Your Boots On - Anthem.  Got a little nod to Nostradamus in the lyrics.  Very cool. Churning, powerful metal filled with energy. One of my favorites.<br /><br />The Trooper - One of Maiden's best songs hands down.  The opening riff is killer and the lyrics are awesome.  Dickinson absolutely f*cking wails here!  This is a personal favorite from way back when me and my friends used to perform this live at band practice on Friday nights with me singing it.  Tight!<br /><br />Still Life - Weird little tune with backward burps and backward German in the intro.  An often overlooked gem, this is another favorite of mine.  When Maiden take it down a notch and give us a slower tune, it works.  Kinda eerie, very cool.  Great song.<br /><br />Quest For Fire -  Towards the end of Piece Of Mind we start to run into the lesser tunes.  Quest For Fire is a good song, but it's Maiden's version of filler.  Nothing awful, but have you ever ran into an Iron Maiden fan who said \\"Quest For Fire is my absolute favorite Maiden tune ever!\\"  Have you?  Didn't think so.  Musically it works, the lyric are ok.  Just doesn't grab me like most of the first five or six songs.<br /><br />Sun And Steel -  This is a good song.  Probably better than the previous, it rocks out loud.  Again, though, not gonna be your favorite Maiden song of all time.  Middle of the road Maiden.<br /><br />To Tame A Land - Maiden (probably mostly Steve Harris) was a big fan of sci-fi legend Frank Herbert's book Dune.  They wnated to write a song about it and contacted Herbert for permission to use the title Dune.  Apparently Herbert was not a big fan of heavy metal, or of Iron Maiden, for that matter, and absolutely refused to give them the go ahead to use the title.  To Tame A Land is a song written about Dune, for better or worse.  I loved the book Dune, it's a classic, but boo on Herbert for being such a prick.  Many a metalhead probably had no idea what To Tame A Land was about, but if you have read the book it makes perfect sense.  Still, not going to be your favorite Maiden song.  It's a cool tune, but it's very fast and the lyrics are very quick, that it mostly passes you by before you've had a chance to digest it.<br /><br />Overall, Iron Maiden followed up their phenomenal Number Of The Beast album with another classic.  After this Maiden would start to slip.  Still there will be flashes of excellence in the following albums, but nothing on the level of this.  This album fits together very well.  Soon filler will start to infiltrate the upcomingefforts more and more.  Sad but true.  Enjoy this one, it's one of Iron Maiden's best efforts.  Sheer metal.<br /><br />Dig it!Maiden's best efforts.  Sheer metal.    Dig it!
0380002930|1.0|I thought that this book was one of the worst I have read. I had to read it for school and i could barely get through the first chapter let alone the whole book. Anyway, the only reason<br /><br />I didn't fail the chapter quizzes was because of Cliff Notes and all the help from other friends. My advice to you, it is an evil book and don't buy, or ever read it. It isn't interesting or captivating, it was just plain stupid. I recomend, stick to the Cliff Notes and make your life easier. I'm just trying to spare you the pain that I went through for about 2 months. Everybody has different opinions, I just felt the need to share mine. Thank you for reading if you read this far and didn't believe I was a liar or something and think,\\"This is just one bad review out of about 800 good ones.\\" Anyway, here I am ranting, but please, do heed my advice.
B00001OH7M|3.0|Space Oddity is mostly a reissue of Bowie's debut album and the standout here is the song Space Oddity.  Now and then we get the glimpses of Bowie's future brilliance, but not much.  Most of the songs here are easily forgotten and better left for dead.  Move ahead to The Man Who Sold The World for redemption.  Still one of my favorite songs of all time, Space Oddity is a gem in an otherwise sea of semi-retarded sci-fi mumbo jumbo bullsh*t.<br /><br />Deal with it!
B000BVD460|3.0|i would much rather own one his other albums than this one.  there are so many good songs he missed. <br /> <br />Eminem lp-  <br />Rock Bottom <br /> <br />Slim Shady lp <br />Kill You <br />kim <br /> <br />Eminem Show <br />White america <br />Soldier <br />Say Goodbye HollyWood <br />Halies Song <br />Til i Collapse <br /> <br />all the songs that were decent off of his newest album were on this album so i didnt list it.  all these songs i listed should of been on that greatest hits album.  why choose mocking bird over hailies song?  another thing that bothers me is that eminem would put out a greatest hits album anyway.  i just don't know what to think <br /> <br />
B000002H97|5.0|The huge, monstrous success of \\"The Black Album\\" led most hardcore Metallica fans to the conclusion that the Metallifux had sold out and become a bunch of posers.  The fact that they came out with the video for 'One' on MTV when they swore that they would never do that started to make long-time diehard fans wonder just where Metallica was heading.  Mainstream popularity is seldom a pretty thing.  The band became superstars very nearly overnight after the album hit the stores at #1 on the charts.  All of the sudden everyone wanted a piece of Metallica and now they weren't the cool little metalhead garage band from SF with the killer tunes and the killer attitude.  Now, they belonged to the masses.  Well...<br /><br />Such is the way of the world.  Get over it!  Metallica went into the studio with guru Bon Jovi-Motley Crue Producer Bob Rock and came out with one of the biggest selling albums of all time.<br /><br />That, my friends, is the whole point of being in the record industry.  Duh!<br /><br />The overall effort here is very determined and charismatic and if this was going to be the album to break Metallica into the mainstream, at least it is a good f*cking album.  Enter Sandman was played into the ground by MTV, but it will always be a Metallica staple, up there with Bellz and Master.  Sad But True, Wherever I May Roam, Holier Thant Thou, Trough The Never, Of Wolf And Man....jeez, they outdid themselves.  The only track here that really gets under my skin is Nothing Else Matters, the love song that should not be.  Heinous.  Otherwise a stellar effort.  Solid.  Classic.  And even though Metallica no longer belonged to a smaller, select group of headbangers after this, they still knew how to rock, and that'z what counted.<br /><br />Dig it!
B000005EJL|5.0|In my opinion, \\"Some Things Never Change\\" is a sophisticated yet touching album that fits well with the recent Supertramp work. I enjoyed every single song in the album, especially \\"Sooner or Later\\" and \\"It's a Hard World\\". Highly recommended to anyone who appreciates Supertramp music style.
B000002HRE|5.0|After the shock of 1996's Load wore off, Metallica came back with 1997's Reload, which appeared to be the B-list of Load's orginal recording sessions.  Well...pretty good B-list.  Since being acclimated to Metallica's new looks and their new non-thrash-metal sound, we find Reload a bit of a refreshment.  Waiting the five years between efforts would have made this a different outing, but since it came out so quickly following Load, the music seemed perfect for the time.<br /><br />\\"Fuel\\" opens the disc and Metallica never looks back.  Not a really bad song on this album, some filler, like \\"Better Than You\\" & \\"Bad Seed\\" & \\"Slither\\" which are typical of Metallica and some standouts.  \\"The Memory Remains\\" was hard to comprehend @ first listen with Marriane Faithful's banshee impression.  \\"Unforgiven II\\" seemed a stretch.  Prince Charming, Attitude & Fixxer are all certified rockers.  Low Man's Lyric is strangely haunting as is Where The Wild Things Are.  All in all a good, straight-forward effort.  Nothing fancy, nothing mind-boggling.<br /><br />Dig it!
B0009I7NNA|4.0|This album and the band are killer! The band definitely has there own sound, which is a must for me. They sort of combine the thrash of Pantera and Machine Head, with the AFI and the singing part of Killswitch Engage., but it is truly a heavy metal album. And these guys have talent too! It's not just that they're loud and fast but they come up with killer riffs and they solo! This is the begining of the next generation of Thrash metal; DO NOT MISS IT!!!
B00001OH7Y|3.0|Scary Monsters had the full intentions of returning Bowie to his former brilliance, but it falls short.  There are too many inconsistencies in between the flashes of greatness.  The title track rox as does the nod to Space Oddity Ashes To Ashes, but that's about as far as Bowie goes to make the full comeback from the brink effort.  Thoroughly dissapointing but still listenable.  Bowie could do a lot worse and so could you.  Not the first Bowie album I would buy, but certainly above Young Americans and Station To Station.<br /><br />Dig it!
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band took me a while to understand. My first listening produced befuddlement in my mind. The songs made no sense and didn't seem all that great. I let time pass and went back to give the album another spin. When listening to the WHOLE album, I realized that this was absolutely, without any sort of doubt in my mind, their magnus opus. No other album will do. Buy all there albums, but get this one first. Or else...
B00001OH7N|5.0|When I first heard The Man Who Sold The World I was struck by the fact that such a great album had been unknown to me for so long.  Having become a Bowie freak later in life, I am still in awe of 1970's The Man Who Sold The World.  Where Space Oddity was just that, odd in most places, TMWSTW is so much more focused and mature.<br /><br />The Width of a Circle, All The Madmen, Running Gun Blues & The Man Who Sold The World are the standouts!  Black Country Rock is raw, but hella-cool.<br /><br />Great album!  Definitely a vision of Bowie to come.<br /><br />Dig it!
0307276902|5.0|My sister is an addiction recovery counselor and her clients convinced her to read this book because they said a lot of what James Frey wrote was how they felt going through recovery. I read it on her recommendation and was floored. This book is amazing. I feel it gives readers a lot of insight to an addict's thought process. I also like that it shows the 12 step program is not the only way but it tends to be the program that is forced on addicts.
B00001OH7X|5.0|This is the final album in which David Bowie and Brain Eno collaborated and it is by far the more accessible of the three.  No lingering after-effects of the instrumental heavy Low and \\"Heroes,\\" Lodger is more pop-oriented and straight-forward.  You can hear the experimental overtures throughout, but they work well here.  Standouts include Fantastic Voyage, D.J., Look Back In Anger, and my personal favorite Red Sails.  Great effort.  Refreshing to hear Bowie making strides back to perfection.<br /><br />Dig it!
B00062J00S|5.0|this movie is a classic because christmas has become a time to help others and look inside ourselves. <br />every year this movie has new meaning. <br />how many of us have \\"stayed\\" out of a sense of duty because of family or friends  -  doing something we hate?? <br />sometimes we must fulfill our duty before we move on to something we want or is more suited to us... <br />i mean how many little towns in america would be a \\"POTTERSVILLE\\" if it weren't for the george's in the world?? <br />tell me there is NOBODY who has ever felt overwhelming grief and despair and be human...  this movie is about selflessness and we need more of it !!!!
B00062ZE3U|2.0|I agree with \\"Hiei\\" Nov.13th when reviewing Mother Earth: Sharon Den Adel can't sing!O.K. for a school concert but too weak to my ear,but judge for yourself.You pays yer money and you takes yer choice as the saying goes.It doesn't seem that the other reviewers have listened to Tarja Turunen of Nightwish or those of Sirenia, \\"old\\" Tristania or even Liv Kristine of Leaves Eyes.I bought this C.D. solely on the strength of the customer reviews which in the past have been highly reliable.Beware the C.D. without music samples I suggest.The recording didn't seem that good either.In fact I was waiting for the thing to end:not a good sign.The tracks all sound more or less the same to my ear.And what is so Gothic about this group anyway?It's too mainstream pop for me.Too much like Evanescence: ok if that's what you like.I suggest Epica is far superior;and Nightwish and Sirenia tower above all else I've heard so far in originality,melody,and individuality of each track.By the way,if you're into heavy metal with a war theme give SABATON of Sweden a try[it's here on Amazon].MIND BLOWING.You won't regret it,believe me!
B00005JO1Y|3.0|Another solidly packed midnight preview screening and the film clocks in at over 3 hours!   <br /> <br />Well, where to start, eh? <br /> <br />I've avoided the trailers, reviews, posters, etc, so that my experience would not be tainted by advance publicity. Thus, I sat in the theatre like a newborn virgin expecting the first tinges of excitement. <br /> <br />The script, although containing several new plot threads, follows the classic formula set down by the original film. The first hour is spent building up the characters, setting up the mystery and allowing some comedy elements to seep in. <br /> <br />Jack Black, who I normally abhor, is acceptable in his role as the megalomaniac director pursuing a doomed project, Adrien Brody has enough charm in his eyes to carry off his role as secondary hero, Andy Serkis as the ship's cook and Kong is simply awesome, Noami Watts lacks the raw eroticism of Jessica Lange and the primordial energy of Fay Wray but she bestows her role with acres of bubbly charisma. The chemistry between her and Kong is palpable and time is given to showcase their tragic romance. <br /> <br />The film has been lovingly created by Peter Jackson and his team of film magicians but there are several moments where the CGI effects look flakey and unvarnished. However, the pacing never wavers and any technical deficiency is easily overlooked by the sheer scale of the adventure which rampages across the screen. The artistic design of the film is beautifully realized and no expense has been spared in creating a mammoth world of danger and suspense. The natives of Skull Island are terrifying in a hallucinatory manner (someone should immediately give Jackson a CANNIBAL / ZOMBIE project next).  <br /> <br />Those amongst us who may deride the film for lacking any intelligent muscle, I simply say just take a moment and ponder upon the sly political subtext that Jackson has weaved into his film. The allusion to recent world events and the ensuing bloodshed islaid bare in the poignant climax. There is also much made of Joseph Conrad's THE HEART OF DARKNESS in the banter between the cabin boy, Jamie Bell, and the ship's Second Mate.  <br /> <br />The soundtrack, as with the recent NARNIA, never really soars and the main love theme lacks the melodic emotional resonance that should impale the hardest of hearts when Kong and his love spend a few tender moments as the sun sets on their world. <br /> <br />Okay, the film may not be as groundbreaking in the way the original one was, but it still has tons of innovation and high octane adventure to capture the minds of most people. <br /> <br />Recommended. <br />
0140011749|5.0|Having NEVER read a P.G. Wodehouse novel I decided that I would pick up a Jeeves book and read that.  And I was totally happy with what I got. 10 short stories, mostly from the first-person view of Bertie Wooster, with one story from the view point of Jeeves himself.  Each story is full of simple, if silly, plots, weird, twisted turns and events, perfect wordcraft and very English characters.  Maybe too English.  The end result is a good book to sit down on a rainy day, to enjoy with tea and a comfortable chair.  Light reading for any place or time.  If you enjoy English humor or are a Rex Stout fan, being people who enjoy the proper use of the language, I would suggest this book

B000063DHL|4.0|Iron Maiden had just come off one of the most successful tours in Metal history with Powerslave.  The live album Live After Death is one of the greatest efforts ever recorded.  And then comes Somewhere In Time...  Here we have a band that is starting to feel comfortable with each other.  A band that has become successful and famous, a band that is going to start to play with their musical formula to make sure that they don't stagnate.  In come the guitar synths.  In come the larger-than-life tunes with grandiose production values.  In comes the hit single that is \\"Wasted Years\\" and Iron Maiden continue to grow in popularity, but at what cost?  If there is a line of demarcation where Iron Maiden begin to slip in the eyes of the true metal fans, it would be right after Piece Of Mind.  Powerslave was cool, but there were a few less than awesome tunes buried in the album's midsection.  Now we have Somewhere In Time, and the need to get a little more mainstream has become too great for the Maiden bunch to deny.  Is Somehwere a bad album?  Is it horrible?  Obviously not.  What it isn't is The Number Of The Beast.  It rocks, but on a lesser level.  There is definitely effort and cohesion on this Maiden outing, it's just that the signature sound is starting to wear a little thin in places.  Let's look at the track listing:<br /><br />Caught Somewhere In Time -  A rocking opener.  Filled with power and pulsing metal goodness.  There is energy here in this song that gives us hope for the following tracks.<br /><br />Wasted Years - Great song.  Probably one of Maiden's more commercially successful tunes.  A personal favorite.  Reflective lyrics.  Great vibe.<br /><br />Sea Of Madness - This song opens with a great barrage of slamming drums and wailing riffs.  Steve Harris is speaking with his bass and we hear it loud and clear.  Good tune.  Reminds me a bit of Flight Of Icarus.  Solid.<br /><br />Heaven Can Wait - Guitar synths are there but done tastefully.  This has an eerie intro that moves straight into the siganture Maiden sound and that detracts because the songs are starting to meld together.  Not as memorable as it should be.  Bruce can still wail, however, and that is great!<br /><br />The Lonliness Of The Long Distance Runner - Uh...  Okay...  The title itself is comepletely un-metal and that made us as teenage headbangers flinch just a little bit.  Solid tune.  Bruce belts it out.  But, alas, sounds like regurgitated Maiden.  The riffs are so close to other songs that it doesn't make me like it a whole hell of a lot.  Solid, but far from great.<br /><br />Stranger In A Strange Land - Ambitious.  Hear that heavy, larger-than-life sound.  Great bass riffs.  Elegant.  One of the better songs on the album.  Taking it down a bit, moody and cool.  I like it.<br /><br />Deja Vu - If you sat down and listened to all of the Iron Maiden albums up to this poit, one right after another, you would know that this has been done before on several levels.  Is Maiden repeating themselves?  Maybe.  It's just that they're good at playing a certain way and it's starting to become tedious.  This is a good song.  The lyrics are cool and Bruce delivers them with passion and precision, but it's not going to be your favorite Maiden tune of all time.  It's not!<br /><br />Alexander The Great - As with Rime Of The Ancient Mariner and To Tame A Land, Maiden saves the ponderous song for last.  It's a good song, not their best, but I happen to have a soft spot for it.  This let's us know that Maiden are historically correct and that they are still thinking man's metal.  It just drags slightly.  That's all.<br /><br />Overall, Somewhere In Time has a large sound filled with driving riffs and slamming drums and wailing Dickinson lyrics.  It means well.  It sounds pretty good.  It just sounds a little reheated after Piece Of Mind and Powerslave.  Could that Maiden signature sound be wearing out? Not necessarily, but some of the songs lack that crucial hook that makes any song great and memorable.  From this point forward, the Maiden boys would start their eventual decline.<br /><br />Dig it!iden boys would start their eventual decline.    Dig it!
006092988X|5.0|I read this book for the first time when I was 13.  I read it again recently, over 10 years later and I think I love it more then I did then.  I truly believe this is one of the most beautiful books ever written.  Smith is so observant of life.  Although Francie is the main character, I love how she gets into the minds of some of the other characters.  For example, the scene where she retells how Johnny and Katie met, and how Katie was willing to give up everything to look at him and love him for the rest of her life.  Aunt Sissy is one of my all time favorite characters.  I love how multi-faceted she is.  How she is so good and \\"bad\\" at the same time.  However, of course, I love Francie, and her amazing observations of life: how she loves how Jewish women are proud when they are pregnant, how she wants to read every book in the library, and how excited she is to go to school.  Another reader mentioned how this book is like an old friend, and I can't agree more.  I open it and reread passages in dark times.  I haven't written many reviews, but this book compels me to recommend it to as many people as possible.
B000063DHK|5.0|One of the best live albums of all time.  Not just metal live albums, live albums period.  Iron Maiden on the World Slavery Tour of '84-85 took over the Long Beach Arena for four straight days and four great shows.  Here is the best of those shows mixed into one great double live Iron Maiden songfest.  Extra tracks include material from London's Hammersmith Odeon show.  Maiden standards abound.  Bruce Dickinson is charming and funny and he wails.  The band is tight.  The album rocks on every level.  Eddie is on the cover after his Powerslave entombment and Derek Riggs' cover is brilliantly done.  Overal there is not a bad spot on this double disc set.  Even the fifteen-minute-plus Rime Of The Ancient Mariner is cool as hell.  Get it, got it, love it.  Up The Irons!<br /><br />Dig it!
0778321606|4.0|My mother-in-law read this in her book club and was immediately thinking of me in connection to the character that suffers with fertility.  She and her book club spent months learning to knit the baby blanket described in the book and then sent it to me as a gift along with a copy of the book.  I was astounded that this group of women (most of whom I have never met)were so inspired by a book that they learned to knit me a baby blanket.  I read it in one sitting.  It's a very light, pleasant read.  While not intellectually stimulating, I still enjoyed the characters and their developing relationships.
B000063DI8|2.0|There comes a time in any great bands existence when someone from the outside, be it a manager or a producer or just a family friend should step in and suggest that they just plain quit.  Well....obviously Iron Maiden didn;t have anyone there to let them know that they had just reached the level of ridiculous.  No Prayer For The Wicked is just plain crap.  There is nothing here woth salvaging.  Even Adrian Smith knew it was time, so he bailed out of the band, leaving the second guitar slot to Janneck Gers.  Public Enema Number One?  Precisely!  Get a clue.<br /><br />Deal with it!
B00005221M|5.0|The cinematography was excellent because the action scenes were not \\"super human\\" they were \\"real\\" and the camera angles complemented the emotions of the actors and the surrounding situations. When the Indian warriors were engaged in hand to hand combat there was no drawn out flashy choreography, it realistic and brutal. To show the emotion of the actors at moments of intense drama the camera was very close in to establish personal feeling for the actors. Most action scene were mid-shots to extreme close even in a scene were you may want to see the action the camera was close to the faces.  <br /> I was on the edge of my seat during every action scene and I enjoyed in drama  <br />I felt a degree of ambivalence when certain characters were killed because if felt like I knew them on a personal level or I may feel like I was them. The director, I think did a good job of building relation ships with the audience and the actors in a short period of time. He was able to reveal that history of the individuals in a way that was personal. <br /> After observing this film several times I couldn't help but notice the way each scene was approached in a way that enabled a smooth transaction from the relatively lengthy dolly shoots into the intense action scenes. This also made a devastating impact on how the characters interacted with each other and how they viewed each other; for instance when the British officer was talking to the Indian scout. The officer was on a horse and on the right side making him appear dominant to the Indian; not only that but yet another example, when the officer was being led by Hawkeye to the fort. They were walking from the left while in the background a raging river flowed against the way the characters were walking, symbolizing the struggles they would encounter and the flood of events that lay on the horizon.  <br /> The action in the movie was not superficial in the way that some action adventure films are made. Even in the movie\\"The Patriot\\" the fight scenes tended to have a scene of mysticism that the brutal fighting and rigid choreography of \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" did not have. the extreme solidity of the motions pertained to real life combat. The choreography and the special effects department must have work tirelessly to show the rawness of the French and Indian war. Nobody was flying through the air and punching each others heads off. It was grounded hand to hand fighting.  In the battle field scene they used real people and not digital effects most of the extras were professional re-enactors. <br /> In the action scenes despite choreography the camera was kept close to the actor's face, now and then it will go to a mid shot or a full shot. This technique allows the actors to show the emotion with their faces, as in the silent film era, forcing the audience to feel the same feelings or contrary ones.  <br /> Talking all this into account we see a very expressive style of filming but it still contains equal contrast with wide shots and tight shots, so the viewer doesn't feel like the actors are in his or her face the whole time. Still the viewer makes a connection with the characters. The audience can live the adventure with the characters. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000063DI9|2.0|The funny thing about Iron Maiden is that even after the sucess of Powerslave and Live After Death, even when their music had taken a dive into mediocrity, they were still selling albums by the ton.  Sure, I remember buying Somewhere In Time and trying to like it and then I remember buying Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son and listening to it once before selling it to a used record shop.  It was crap and I didn't even try to lie to myself about learning to like it.  Iron Maiden had made a concept album and I was devastated.  To me, even back then when I was 16 or 17, the show was over.  It's hard to see your heroes expire and run out of plausable ideas.  A few years ago I ended up buying Seventh Son on enhanced CD to complete my Maiden collection and I like it a little more than I did back in the day.  It's still horrible, but not unlistenable.  Moonchild is decent.  Can I Play With Madness is slightly charming.  The Evil That Men Do is bland.  Other than that, I really don't care too much for Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son.  Formulaic Iron Maiden.  They're not on auto-pilot here, they've flatlined.  Utter destruction.<br /><br />Deal with it!
B000B5H7QO|5.0|Mighty Rearranger is far and away the best CD Robert Plant has made.  It's probably the CD I've enjoyed the most of any I bought this year.  While the live disk is probably only of interest to Plant fans, it is excellent, and does his excellent 2005 live dates justice. <br /> <br />Spring for this one if you're a fan, but go for the standard release if you're jusst looking for a great listen.
B000063DFN|5.0|It's very hard to keep my head straight when it comes to 1984's Powerslave.  My first instinct is to say that it's another metal classic from Iron Maiden and then I digress....  Was Powerslave truly an awesome Iron Maiden album?  Of course many the Maiden fan is gonna say HELL YESSSSS!! but when breaking it down song by song as I will do, Powerslave comes up lacking.  Now, this is probably the very last Iron Maiden album that kept the cohession of a really good album alive as far as it went, but there is filler here and it's pretty obvious.  Where Piece Of Mind had six pretty killer tunes in a row, Powerslave is choppy.  There is killer and not-so-killer intermixed.  So, when you, the absolute die-hard Iron Maiden fan think back to Powerslave, instinct says to call it awesome, but further review says something else.  Let's look at the album song by song, for that is the only way an album should be judged, for it is ALL the pieces of the puzzle that make the picture complete, right?<br /><br />Aces High -  Maiden always has pretty good opening songs and Aces High is no exception, but they tend to keep the better songs for second or third or later.  Aces High is a solid tune with the signature Maiden riffs and driving Harris bass line.  Not their best, but very far from their worst.  Average Maiden we'll call it.  Cool.<br /><br />2 Minutes To Midnight - AWESOME SONG!!!!  One of my all-time top-ten favorite Maiden tunes, along with Running Free, Killers, Beast, Run To The Hills, The Trooper, etc....  The lyrics are brutal and I dig that.  Great, all-out effort.  Perfectly Maiden and perfectly metal!  We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.....<br /><br />Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) - Uh... hmmmm.  A churning, pounding instrumental.  Is this Genghis Kahn?  Is this Transylvania?  Maiden hasn't done an instrumental since Killers and this isn't up to par with their earlier efforts.  Almost sounds like a Maiden tune that someone forgot to put lyrics to.  Middle of the road.  Have you ever heard anyone say that Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) was their favorite song? I sincerely hope not!  It's decent, that's all.<br /><br />Flash Of The Blade - This song is an underrated rocker that gets overlooked mostly because the lyrics are a bit choppy.  The chorus is straight Maiden, but it lacks the necessary hooks that make a Maiden song great.<br /><br />Duellists - Apparently the whole fencing thing that Maiden was into at the time was starting to appear in their songs.  This songs sounds very, very, very reminiscent of Where Eagles Dare.  Doesn't it?  Yeah.  Maiden is already starting to repeat themselves and that detracts from this song.  Also, the lyrics are garbled just a tad and Bruce is whiny.  Not a good combo.  Okay.  Not great.  Musically, it rocks fairly well, but it sounds like Maiden on cruise control.<br /><br />Back In The Village - This song is very cool.  The opening riff is energetic and catchy.  The lyrics are good.  The biggest problem is that it's buried behind three filler tunes in a row and that makes it tarnished.  Once you lose the cohession of a good flowing album, the songs start to run together like melting wax and renders them unmemorable.  Back In The Village should have been closer to the front of the album to remain effective.<br /><br />Powerslave - Egyptian themed title track buried in obscurity.  The album cover is very Egyptian in nature and Derek Riggs outdid himself in his detail.  Awesome.  But with the cover depicting the Egyptian Valley Of The Kings ala Eddie, where are the rest of the songs that keep that theme going?  There aren't any.  What Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)? Didn't think so.  It was expected when you bought the album that there would be a little bit more Egypt in its content.  Oops!  This song is pretty good, however, just should have been second or third or fourth, not second to last.  When it was on vinyl, it probably got overlooked quite a bit.<br /><br />The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner - Sammuel Taylor Collerige's epic poem turned into and Iron Maiden song that clocks a litte over 13 1/2 minutes.  It took me more than a decade to like this song and now it's one of my favorites.  Shows us once again that although Maiden are metalheads, they're literate metalheads, and that is a good thing.  Awesome tune. Some fans will disagree, saying that it's too long, but f*ck 'em, it rips.<br /><br />Overall, as you look back at Powerslave as I have just done, you can pick out the flaws quite easily.  There is filler here and there that brings it down to a great album instead of an AWESOME album.  Number Of The Beast and Killers were awesome!  Piece of Mind and Powerslave are great.  The cohession is there most of the way, but the filler shows and Maiden feels like they're going through the motions without much emotion on some of the middle songs.  I still rated Powerslave with five stars because it is probably the very last great Iron Maiden album (though many will disagree, thinking that Maiden continued to get better instead of worse) but that's a fight of opinions and I'm not here for that.  If I were trying Maiden for the first time I would pick The Number Of The Beast.  Simply because it's a much better, more honest effort.<br /><br />Dig it!d into and Iron Maiden song that clocks a litte over 13 1/2 minutes.

B00005AFVR|5.0|This album is just truly fantastic!!! Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band create great music especially when they do it \\"live\\".  Especially with the hard rock songs like \\"Born to Run\\", \\"Badlands\\", \\"My Love Will Not Let You Down\\" and others.  I feel that Springsteen's folk rock songs sound better on the studio cuts, but I feel that his hard rock songs sound so much better LIVE.  From my experience with going to their live concerts and listening to this album, I find that Bruce and the E-Street Band put so much more energy into those hard rock tunes when their live than when they were first released in previous studio albums.   <br /> <br />Especially since this album was created in 2001 (quite recently), Bruce and the band have those songs down in their memories and are so used to playing them that they come out smother and produce so much more raw energy that this live album from them sounds better than any earlier live albums that they've done. In general I just love to here Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band perform live especially for those hard rock songs.  They are so well known for their live performances it's not even funny!  I should know, I've been to quite a few already.  They perform between 3 to 4 hours and there is never any opening band, it's just them playing - WOW!  <br /> <br />I've been to many concerts from many different groups and I find that many of them sound exactly the same live than they do in their studio albums.  Though, Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band sound so much better, more INTENSE, and rock so much harder when they perform LIVE!!!!!!! Take my advice, if you can't see one of their concerts, at least pick up this live album!!!   <br />
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I'll make this review quick, because this epic masterpiece is just...well, an epic masterpiece. <br /> <br />When Merian C. Cooper first made _King Kong_ in 1933 (1933!!), it was something truly one-of-a-kind that had come out of nowhere.  To this day it is considered a masterpiece of filmmaking, largely (of course) due to the mighty title character and the incredible animation which really made the picture so convincingly powerful.  There have been countless imitations (namely the entire Godzilla franchise), as well as several remakes (the forgettable Jeff Bridges flick of the `70's) and rehashes (_Mighty Joe Young_, both version of which are actually decent and original).  However, why would Peter Jackson, with all the money in the world still flooding in to him on the tails of the _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy, want to re-make this film?  Because, quite simply, he loved the original, and felt that it deserved to be everything that it was and more, for audiences young and old, then and forever. <br /> <br />I spent at least a third of the movie crying (yes, I'm serious), another third (almost) screaming and/or laughing in fairly even doses, and the other third just sitting there, absolutely amazed. <br /> <br />First off, Kong is truly the main star, of course.  So much is told from him and his...well, his acting really, he truly is the best silent actor in decades. <br /> <br />I've been a Naomi Watts fan for a rather brief time now, but after seeing her here, I hold her in high regards as one of my new favorite actresses.  As talented as she is downright gorgeous, she really packs a wallop, and her chemistry with Kong is heartwarming and tragic. <br /> <br />Jack Black.  Oh my god.  I've always found him to be hilarious - the only image really associated with him until now - and so when I found out that he was going to be playing Carl Denham, I didn't know quite what to think.  Was he going to be serious?  Was he going to be funny?  Well, he was both - and now I can tell that this rendition of the character wasn't based on the actor; no, Peter Jackson chose Jack Black to be Carl Denham because *this* Carl Denham needed someone like Jack Black.  Funny, obsessive, eccentric...this was a perfect casting. <br /> <br />Adrian Brody.  I'd only previously seen him act in _The Village_, which is not to say he left much of an impression on me (aside from loads of mentally handicapped laughter).  However, I've had respect for this young actor ever since seeing his reaction to his winning the Academy Award for Best Actor (in _The Pianist_).  And now, seeing him play as the screenwriter-turned-hero in _King Kong_, I must say I hold him in high regards as a very talented actor, and I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing him in more roles. <br /> <br />The scenery (especially the incredible recreation of 1930's New York) was gorgeous, thick on atmosphere as well as culturally precise. <br /> <br />The special effects were downright spectacular; I have an all-too-unfortunate ability to tell what's a special effect and what's not, and while I could easily have picked out what was real and wasn't in this movie, so convincing was the directing and editing that I simply was awed and wowed by the motions, the sounds, the monsters and backgrounds (and the actors' places therein). <br /> <br />The score and soundtrack were excellent...from '30's songs that had both lyrical and cultural significance to the film and the setting, respectively, to James Newton Howard's effective compositions, the music was excellently involved.  Not to mention it was simply a brilliant moment when the very, very subtle score slithers into your ears during the Spider Pit sequence...and speaking of which... <br /> <br />My father owns a book about early Hollywood films and filmmaking, and there are several great sections (including a whole chapter) dedicated to the original _King Kong_.  On one page, there is a conceptual art sketch and a film still of \\"the famed SpiderPit sequence,\\" which Cooper deleted from the film due to pacing constraints.  In this scene, various members of the U.S.S. Venture who fell into the ravine (after Kong shakes them off the giant fallen tree) are picked off by various slimy creatures...and judging from the sketch and the still, this would have been a rather gruesome moment in the film had it been left in.  Well, Peter Jackson included this whole scene in his movie, and it could not have been creepier and more disgusting (but effectively showing just how strange Skull Island really is). <br /> <br />This movie is the result of a fan's dedication to a favored piece of art.  Mr. Jackson knew just how to re-create this movie without making it just another remake.  He took something already great and made it even better.  _King Kong_ is definitely the best movie I've seen all year...and may it be the same for you too.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Over the top?  A bit.  Politicaly incorrect?  You bet!  Funny?  YES!!<br /><br />This movies is really a funny, funny film.  The social commentary is fantastic, the political humor slaps some activists around, the sex scene is a bit over the top, but it is funny unless you are pretentious, in fact if you are at all pretentious dont bother with this. film because it is for people with a sense of humor, not for those with a misled state of political correctness.
B000BJS4BM|5.0|This is an amazing special edition of Madonna's worldwide successful album \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\".  The packaging is exquisite, probably the best so far for a special edition of a Madonna CD.  The photo booklet has many rare and unseen versions from the photo shoot for the album and is printed on heavy stock, glossy photo paper.  What an amzing CD and special edition package.  There is also a blank journal where you can keep your \\"Confessions\\" and some of the pages have hand written lyrics by Madonna from the song \\"Like it or Not\\" (also a few cute drawings).  Be sure and get this on your Xmas list as it will surely be a collector's item.
B000002J03|5.0|Anyone who didn't give this album  5 stars should be hunted down and killed painfully. For God's sake it's a Zeppelin album! The very presence of the sacred name of Zeppelin means that you HAVE to give it 5 stars.''Nuff said.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Before 1989's 'Like a Prayer', many felt that Madonna would dissapear like the other flash-in the pan pop tarts of the flourishing MTV age. Sure she was a trendsetter and she had some hits (okay, a lot of hits), but did she have anything to say? Up until this album she had been dubbed a singles artist. While 1986's 'True Blue' took a mature step in social commentary, primarily in \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", the album didn't stray too far from her earlier, effortless \\"let's just party\\" agenda. 'Like a Prayer' parties with the best of them, but it also was Madonna's breakthrough as far as serious artistic acheivement was concerned. She has tried to duplicate it's religious/sexual charm and introspective themes on recent albums, but they fail to measure up to the spiritual ephiphany she finds on 'Like a Prayer'. With pretty much every Madonna album, controversy is included. The stellar first single and title track infuriated the world with it's video, which showed Madonna dancing in her underwear in church and in front of burning crosses, depicting stigmata in her hands, and kissing a statue of a black saint that comes to life. Setting off a tradition that will stretch right on up to 2003's \\"American Life\\" video, it is her clips that often get the attention. In the case of \\"Like a Prayer\\", however, the song with it's confessions of lust and faith and orgasmic, soaring choir, holds it's own and forced everyone back then to ignore any mixed messages the video may have given. It's become (and should remain) the blueprint for many Madonna songs to come. The album is the same way. It twists in both consistency and surprise, first offering a female empowerment anthem, \\"Express Yourself\\" and a song about a turbulent, violent relationship, \\"Til Death Do Us Part\\", to a giddy valentine packed with pop rocks and sweet tarts, \\"Cherish\\", and reflections on the death of her mother, \\"Promise to Try\\". What makes the album so amazing may be it's humanization of Madonna, who has been seen by most as an untouchable diva. Here, she seems warm, inviting, and ready to talk to God. God is undoubtedly one of the men she confronts on \\"Oh Father\\". On an album built around faith and strength, her relationship with a higher power feels strained. She is hurt by male influences on \\"Oh Father\\", contemplates if there is a God on \\"Spanish Eyes\\", and gets in a tizzy on judgement day in the welcomed quirkiness of  \\"Act of Contrition\\" (for more quirkiness look to \\"Dear Jesse\\", an acid trip lullabye), when her name is nowhere to be found on the list. While 'Like a Prayer' is built around her feelings about religion, it also hits home. Where she tackles domestic violence, death, and the uncertainty of love on the beginning of the record, she struggles to find her place in the family order on the funky \\"Keep it Together\\". It's a song that speaks volumes about not only Madonna's family frustration, but her place in the world. It's a fitting position for a star whose career has mostly centered around fashion statements, shock, and carefully coreographed videos. It's a bold step in a career meant to take risks, experiment, and celebrate self expression. 'Like a Prayer' is a tour de force and ended the 1980s on a very high note.
B00005JO1Y|1.0|In 1993 Steven Spielberg blessed us with Jurassic Park, the movie was a sight to behold the special effects of the dinosaurs were spectacular.  Nearly thirteen years later Peter Jackson attempts to awe his audiences in the same matter.  King Kong tried to hard to replicate Spielberg's success.  The movies special effects were worse than we witnessed twelve years ago.  Where have movies gone sense 1993?  Backwards.  The CG in this movie was anything but spectacular.  I found myself laughing at how horrible the graphics look for a movie of this size.   <br /> <br />The horrible graphics aside there were two other contributing factors to this movies downfall.  First, the movie was far to long.  At three hours and seven minutes long I found myself tired and disinterested.  The movie seemed to have the same long drawn out scenes which although were interesting at first became old and repetitive.  The same movie with the same story could have been made in a simple two hours.  Jackson tried to hard to replicate the success he had with the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I'm not sure why Hollywood feels they need to bore audiences with long meaningless scenes that fail to contribute to the story.  I feel that Hollywood has failed to produce a well-written movie sense Lord of the Rings.  The one and only exception being Walk The Line, which still managed to have some long boring scenes.  The second factor that I felt made this movie as bad as it was, quite simply the horrible acting, throughout the movie I found myself laughing at how bad Jack Black was portraying his character.  Face it Jack you're a comedian stick to that.   <br /> <br />One last thing about this movie I found was the fight sequences.  I don't know what it is with film makers these days but ever sense the Borne Identity was released every director thinks they need that choppy in your face fight scenes where nobody can tell what is going on.  Frankly it was good in those movies and that is all.  I personally think Jackson isn't as great as a director as everybody makes him out to be.  He is repetitive bleak and unexciting. <br /> <br />Thank You <br />
B0006GAOBI|1.0|I know, I know. It's hard to believe, but it's true. The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko is TERRIBLE compared to the studio release. The way the film is pieced together is not nearly as effective as the original, nor were the director's choices in terms of soundtrack. Please, if you are going to buy this film for a Donnie Darko fanatic, buy them the studio release instead. <br /> <br />By the way, before you slam my review, please know that I am a devotee of Donnie Darko. I've seen it several times at midnight screenings at Two Boots Theater in Alphabet City (in NYC, baby!).
B000000YIQ|5.0|Sonny Rollins appears to be at the top of his game on this album,he recorded in '57,with Shelley Manne on drums and Ray Brown on bass.I just don't understand why he felt he needed to take off '59 to '61 from public performing to practice on The Williamsburg Bridge before coming back with 'The Bridge';maybe seeing him on the bridge could beat 'Way Out West' and 'The Bridge',but nothing else could. I also can't understand why 'Way Out West' includes two takes of some of the tunes,beginning with <br />'I'm An Old Cowhand';it was brilliant on the first take...and the second..
B0007O38F8|2.0|I will admit, I did like 50 Cent when he first came upon the scene. I mean, the people got to admit, when we heard \\"Wanksta\\" the first time, or even \\"In Da Club\\", we were all smittened by him. Once \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" came out, it did sell great amount of units and put 50 on the map. However, he still shadows his producestors (Dr. Dre & Eminem). His beef with Ja Rule became so ridiculous that everyone agreed with him on the fact that Ja was a fake. However, as time passed, 50 became more annoying than anything, jumping on other projects and starting other avenues, such as clothing, sneakers, and the G-Unit Record label. However, he claims that he is not like Ja Rule at all, in any way. But, once I heard \\"The Massacre\\", that is exactly what the title stated, a massacre. The album showed no growth in his lyrical ability or his depth. More of the songs were about just partying or shaking @#$!$, and even throwing up the same stuff that made him famous (the whole 9 shots to the body, need I say more). Not to mention that 50 actually \\"harmonizes\\" on the records, from \\"Disco Inferno\\", to \\"Just a Lil' Bit\\" and even the track with Olivia, whick reminded me of Ja Rule and Ashanti. The only plus to the album was the fact that, before the rerelease of the album, that The Game blasted 50 on his own track on \\"Hate It or Love It (Remix)\\". Not to mention the production from Dr. Dre, Eminem, Scott Sorch, and others were superb, but couldn't save this album. Overall, The Massacre is not worth buying, or not even downloading. This doesn't even measure up to what \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" sold, or even The Game's \\"The Documentary\\" sold. If I were you guys, I would not spend my 15 dollars on this album, unless if you like \\"Pop-hip-hop\\", then it is all yours. Damn, it is even bad that I even gave hime two stars for this album, it is not worthy to even get two stars. OOOOOO! Don't get me started on G-Unit! No more comments!

B000BVD460|4.0|When I heard about Eminem releasing a greatest hits album, I was kinds skeptical about that. I mean, Eminem and a greatest hits album? It just doesn't sound right, since he is still making great music. But, due to the periods of exhaustion and rehab, it was time for him to actually take a break from the industry. What better way to start his break, but by releasing a greatest hits cd. When I bought it, I was pretty impressed by what was on the album. All of his songs that grace radio airwaves and music television are on the album. But, the most impressive songs that appeared on the album, were the three brand new songs. \\"Fack\\" is a tongue & cheek, slim-shady style of song, that may make you blush in either disgust or in embarrassment. \\"Shake That\\", which features Nate Dogg, or was it the other way around? Whatever the case, its a more of a party joint, something that is quite different from Eminem, but his production has grown and is becoming more respected. And finally, my favorite song, \\"When I'm Gone\\" is a somber song, probably discussing why he is probably taking a break from being a solo artist. These songs are what makes up \\"Curtain Call\\".  <br />     In addition, if you buy the limited edition album, it includes a \\"Stan's Mixtape\\". What is that you ask? It is an additional cd that includes 7 songs that are hardcore. Three songs are from the \\"Slim Shady LP\\", one from the \\"Marshall Mathers LP\\", and three songs from others albums that he was featured on, such as Notorious B.I.G.'s album \\"Born Again\\" and Jay-Z \\"The Blueprint\\". Overall, this greatest hits album is even better if you get the limited edition album. This is worth buying, if you are the die-hard Eminem fan or for those that just like the songs that have grace the airwaves.
B00000DGUG|4.0|I haven't been the biggest Alanis Morissette fan over the years, not of the dully calculated slower portions of Jagged Little Pill, or of the bland, Yoda-speak therapy sessions of her later albums like So-Called Chaos.  Something about Supposes Former Infatuation Junkie strikes me as much different, however.  It's her longest record, and in many ways, her most ambitious, and in its desultory, any-topic-will-do breadth, it gets closest and most interestingly into Morissette's unique and specific mindset.  It may be the Glen Ballard production, at his pop best here, but songs like \\"Thank U\\" are heartfelt and genuine, \\"Unsent\\" and \\"That I Would Be Good\\" take the now-kinda-silly Alanis enlightenment and makes it appealing, fresh, and wholly unshakeable.  It has its lagging moments - too many of those dragging psychobabble numbers like \\"Can't Not\\" and \\"The Couch\\" - but even with those, there's a fuller picture of a crusty, specific consciousness at play, one that really does prove Morissette's vitality in music.  The album's last song, \\"Your Congratulations,\\" could be a stripped-down mess as Morissette does, well, interesting things with notes clearly out of her range, but there's no doubt by that point she's earned it - a wise and moving declaration of who she is, definitively, without any of those congratulations.
B000002L9J|5.0|They don't come much better than this. Although all four core members of The Smiths assert that \\"Strangeways, Here we Come\\" is the band's masterpiece, it's hard to see were they are coming from when you put this in your stereo. Everything that typifies the songwriting partnership of Johnny Marr and Morrissey is here:-  <br />In \\"Frankly, Mr. Shankley\\" We have Morrissey's dry wit coming to the forefront in this loosely disguised tirade at Geoff Travis of Rough Trade records. Then we have the absolute melancholy presented by \\"There is a light that never goes out\\", a song that talks of joint suicide in a way that is bizarrely and poetically beautiful. However, it is not just Morrissey's lyrics that display genius but every song is musically perfect with Marr's guitar pieces fitting perfectly with Morrissey's words. Indeed, the album's title track is the best song on the album and it is made so not by Morrissey's words but by Marr's musical genius.  <br />All in all this is one of the finest albums of the twentieth century.
0064407667|5.0|Please do not read this, as it is unpleasent. I have had the misfortune of reading and rereading all of the books Mr. Snicket put onto the market. I am so sad that he did. I am an aspiring author, and his works aspire me, but they also make me cry. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK, FOR IF YOU DO, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RUN AWAY. YOU WILL BE IN COUNT OLAF'S CLUTCHES.
1573223085|3.0|John Hwung's review is spot-on, to my thinking.  To sell books one has to frame movements as radical shifts where the old is out and the new is in.  (Pink did, thankfully, avoid the phrase \\"paradigm shift.\\")  Now someone needs to write about \\"The Amalgamated Economy,\\" wherein the essential elements of the Agricultural, Industrial, Information and Conceptual Ages blend to make for a healthy global economy.  No nation will long survive if significant numbers of people try to make a living designing toilet bowl brushes.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|Movies usually either meet, go below, or totally exceed your expectations. &lt;em>Batman Begins&lt;/em> was more masterful than I could've hoped and as far as comic book movies go it blows &lt;em>X2&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Spider-man 2&lt;/em> totally out of the water. Not only that, but it's a great movie even without being in the comic book genre. This movie has nothing to do whatsoever with the first four Batman incarnations and is not really a prequel. It's a starting Batman movie the way it was meant to be done. The acting was completely and utterly spot-on. I can't imagine if Bruce Wayne would've been so perfect without Christian Bale and Michael Caine really puts Michael Gough to shame as Alfred. Hopefully, more people will show love for Gary Oldman after him aptly portraying a pre-Comissioner Gordon. Cillian Murphy is finally showing the mainstream public, who likely hadn't heard of him, how good he really is in his role as Scarecrow and it just felt right. Katie Holmes and Morgan Freeman did very well reinventing their characters and I just love how they both interacted with Bruce Wayne. I'm not going to talk about Liam Neeson and Ken Wantanabe to avoid spoilers, but just know that they were no different from the rest.<br /><br />I still have more to say though so indulge me for another paragraph. Acting is all well and good, but what is it that makes this movie so special? The careful attention poured onto every shot. When you can't tell what's cg and what's real, you know you have a winner. You may think that the bats aren't real, but you'd be surprised which scenes actually had live bats. Part of this grueling attention comes from the dialogue though, which I just fell in love with. Not a single line was actually corny or out of place, but rather it got to its point without having to dumb things down at all. It all seemed pretty intricate, and I liked how key lines (especially those relating to big themes) came back. &lt;em>Batman Returns&lt;/em> came on last night and comparing this script to that one is like comparing night to day. David Goyer really outdid himself and so did Christopher Nolan. For the latter to top &lt;em>Memento&lt;/em> is no small feat, and yet he managed to do it right here. Not only was his hand in the script good but also his sense of art direction and grabbing the essence of Batman. The whole movie seems designed for people my age and older because of how dark it is. Batman isn't scary when he goes around in a batsuit like in those old four movies, but he may strike fear in you a couple of times when he does what he does this time around! It's hard for me to scrape up anything I didn't like besides one thing I don't really want to spoil (very minor anyway) and how fast the hand-to-hand combat was. I think the latter was on purpose, but I just would've preferred to see them go a little slower. Of course, it makes sense that in real life the people fighting wouldn't slow down and what this movie did best was putting you in a world where everything happening seemed possible, not gimmicky. I loved the subtle explanations of things and the batmobile may not look as sleek as before but it's definitely more useful.<br /><br />The video and sound quality are pretty good, though I feel that the transfer could've been a little brighter though I was watching the movie on an older television model. The special features are accessed via a comic book, which is kind of neat, but I'd rather just have it all straightforward rather than hunt for them (though if you navigate to the last page of it you can do this also). The features I've watched so far are really good and none are too long so you can easily watch them all in short bursts. They range from his training to the history of the movie's development to the costume design and down to the creation of Gotham City. Plus, you learn a lot of nifty things like how much fighting Christian Bale actually had to learn and that the scenes in the mountains were filmed on location. If you enjoyed the movie I feel that this set is pretty worthwhile. Even if they were to release a super duper edition, this is really all you need to thoroughly enjoy the film. The only thing that's missing is a commentary track, but I've heard that Nolan's commentary on &lt;em>Memento&lt;/em> sucks anyway so it's no big deal.ilmed on location.

B000AGTPUU|4.0|I enjoyed this movie for the sake of what they were trying to do with technology.  However I can't help but think that I would have like this as live-action, not the way is was done, but I suppose cost was the driving factor.<br /><br />Be warned, I tried playing this movie on a JVC and a Norcent player, and it could not be read.  This happened with two versions of the disc.  So maybe some players can't read it.
B000BP86OG|4.0|I didn't think it was possible for the Darkness to actually top Permission to Land but with \\"One Way Ticket to Hell...\\" they may have actually done it.  The music is a bit more layered and produced and that's fine by me.  The important thing is that it rocks, it's catchy, and it's hilarious.  The song \\"One Way Ticket\\" is the best song about cocaine ever written and a possible successor for \\"I Believe in a Thing Called Love.  You won't be able to get the chorus from \\"Knockers\\" out of your head and songs 3 and 4 are awesome.  Hazel Eyes is proably my favorite song on the album.  My wife swears they played that song at the concert in West Palm Beach but it seems like I would have remembered a song this great.  Bald is another standout track and one that I can certainly relate to. The rest of the songs on the record are solidly good songs. I hope this record finally brings The Darkness the attention in the U.S. that they deserve.
B00005KKAQ|2.0|Its too bad because there are great live recordings out there (HELLO, will someone officially release the 1967 Matrix Club appearences) but this ain't it.  The reason is not the sound quality (which is excellent) or the song choices (wisely focusing on earlier more solid albums) but the performances. By this time Jim Morrison had turned into a bloated, Charles Bukowski-ish parody of his former self. The songs meander and jam unwisely and Morrison mutters some lyrics here and there. This is not to say that the Doors were not good live (consider the official 1968 Roundhouse performance dvd- a solid concert right there) but that due to personal reasons as well as the band kind of running out of steam the live shows had declined into an impromptu poetry recital with musical back up. There is quality material out there. Wait until they release it.
B00005JO1Y|2.0|I went into this movie expecting to love it.  I had never seen a movie get such high praise and great reviews.  I had such high anticipation.  I even tried to MAKE myself like it as I sat there for three interminable hours, remembering how much I loved all 21 hours I spent watching every edition of Lord of the Rings, and how back then I was ready to dub Peter Jackson the new Lord, or King, or whatever title he wanted, of cinema.<br /><br />But it wasn't happening.  Aside from the ape, who is personified beautifully, and Adrien Brody (who is fantastic in everything), there isn't anything really to like about this movie.  It takes over an hour to get to Skull Island and along the way we are introduced to a lot of people we didn't need to meet.  These include \\"Jimmy,\\" whose name is called in a plaintive way over and over again, the token black character (guess what happens to him?) and a passel of nobodies who have no effect on the outcome of the story.  The digital effects look like a video game at the best of times and like a cartoon at the worst.  Even if the unnecessary 95 minutes were chopped out, this movie would still be spectacularly mediocre.  Assisting it to that end are the dozen or so COMPLETELY ridiculous slow-motion moments that Peter Jackson threw in.  They happen at the worst of times and they look TOTALLY amateurish, as if Peter Jackson let his kids use the video camera and film those segments.  Every single time another one of those moments -- and then ANOTHER ONE!! -- came on-screen, I found myself remembering that Peter Jackson really hasn't directed that many movies.<br /><br />I don't understand what went wrong here.  I am completely baffled as to WHY this movie is so bad.  I'm sure a lot of people will like it, but I have never fled a theater so fast in my life.  The only thing that saved the movie for me was the love story at its core, between Anne Darrow and King Kong.  We're not told anything about her character that makes her worth caring about, but somehow her big melty baby blues connected with Andy Serkis + CGI in a way that sold me, and I actually found myself rooting for the two of them.<br /><br />Or maybe I just needed something to root for to justify my continued presence in the theater.  Either way, I simply cannot bring myself to commend this failed effort.  Kong may be King, but Peter Jackson, in my book, has officially been dethroned.her big melty baby blues connected with Andy Serkis + CGI in a way that sold me, and I actually found myself rooting for the two of them.

B000BMSTMS|4.0|Finding themselves one member short, Korn's new sound does not reflect any kind of loss.  This album is dubbed \\"experimental\\" by several sources, but the sound is more evolutionary than experimental.  The first single \\"Twisted Transistor\\" has been on rock radio top ten lists since it debuted.  The straight blistering rock that Korn's fans have been eating up is evident (in full force) on tracks like \\"Hypocrites\\", \\"Liar\\", and \\"For No One\\".  Midway through, we find \\"Open Up\\" which was described by bassist Fieldy as a strip club track.  Funky, chunky bass lines and swervy lyrics make this a tasty departure from the norm.  Many would expect a gap in the signature buzzing and grinding guitars due to former axeman Head's exit.  There is no void left behind as Munky pours more into his playing and Fieldy cranks up the bass.  \\"Coming Undone\\" has been selected as the 2nd single off the album due to its anthemic nature, with the pounding pulse throughout the song reminiscent of Queen's \\"We Will Rock You\\".  Allowing a break for your eardrums are the tracks \\"Throw Me Away\\" and \\"Love Song\\" near the middle of the album.  \\"Love Song\\" has Davis' vocal style lending tribute to David Bowie for a very enjoyable experience.<br /><br />All in all, core fans will appreciate the new direction while haters will just do what they do best.  Korn is refined, renewed, and ready to take their new sound to the people for a long time to come.  My advice to those who purchase this album: TURN IT UP LOUD!
B000BJS4BM|5.0|1. Hung Up - My favorite track on the album. Super catchy. Has a fabulous ABBA sample of Gimme, Gimme, Gimme (A Man After Midnight). <br /> <br />Rating: 10/10 <br /> <br />2. Get Together - A nice, slighty boring track. One part of the <br />song kind of remindeds me of her previous hit \\"Holiday.\\" <br />Rating: 6/10 <br /> <br /> <br />3.Sorry - Another breakup song. The track begins with Madonna saying the word \\"Sorry\\" in many different laguages. It's the next single. \\"Sorry\\" chorus samples the bass line from The Jacksons' song \\"Can You Feel\\". <br /> <br />Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br />4. Future Lovers - Starts with Madonna once again speaking. Contains which seems to becoming a popular lyrics from the album, \\"In the evidence of it's brilliance.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Rating: 6/10 <br /> <br />5. I Love New York - This song has an awesome beat. Lyrics kind of suck though. But I think she kind of wanted it to sound stupid. Like the rap part in American Life. <br /> <br /> <br />Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br />6. Let It Will Be - This song also features an awesome beat. The lyrics are about her fame as a internation superstar. <br /> <br />Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br />7. Forbidden Love - This song doesn't really fit on this album but one of my favorites nevertheless. Features a nice blend of vocoder and untainted vocals. <br /> <br />Rating: 9/10 <br /> <br />8. Jump - a nice track and keeps the pace of the album slighty slower. <br /> <br />Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br />9. How High - Another one of the favoites. My favorite lyric in is in this song, \\"It's funny how everybody mentions my name, they're never very nice.\\" <br /> <br />Rating: 9/10 <br /> <br />10. Isaac - I think this is a pretty good track. The humming in it reminds me of \\"Frozen\\" of her album, Ray of Light. The chant isn't too bad <br /> <br />Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> <br />11. Push - A very motovational song Madonna wrote about her husband. It has a great beat. <br /> <br />Rating: 9/10 <br /> <br />12. Like It Or Not - This song doesn't really fit on this album. A textbook close to the album. <br /> <br />Rating: 6/10 <br /> <br />Fighting Spirit - a nice slower song. Kind of repetitive.  <br />Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br />Overall Rating: 9/10
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna Ciccone, born in 1958 to a large, Catholic family and working her way into the entertainment industry in the early 80's, has become the most prolific and productive pop artist in human history.   <br /> <br />While scanning through all of Madonna's work up to this point, one can say, although she's had her ups and downs, she has never disappeared from the American mind.  Her music and presentation knows no limits or deceleration, and it would appear as though she has, with the newly released Confessions on a Dance Floor, topped herself once again. <br /> <br />Through the entire masterpiece of luxurious, hedonistic dance beats and quirky lyrics, one can gain a greater sense of Madonna's journey toward self-discovery, perfection, and her undying drive to become the most cherished, creative, colorful, and godly woman alive.   <br /> <br />Amidst all the controversy surrounding her at all times, it seems she has found a way to retain all that energy and pour it into her recent work, which, by the way, is the most anticipated album of 2005.  And, boy did that anticipation pay off.   <br /> <br />Confessions, beaten only by 1998's grammy-winning Ray of Light, is a cosmic force to be reckoned with.  Broadcasting messages of hope, fun, purity, and yes, even spirituality all on a dance album, this could very well be entered into the Top 100 albums of all time, top 10 on my list personally.    <br /> <br />\\"Hung Up\\" is, simply stated, SONIC PERFECTION.  Every fade in/out, beat, transition, pace, verse, and everything else is CELESTIAL.  It is what pop music is truly meant to be: catchy, fun, slightly inquisitive, and damn awesome sounding.  Her vocals are dead-on precise and beautiful.   <br /> <br />That being said, the entire rest of the album is almost as good!  It's things like this that remind you of why creativity is so close to godliness.   <br /> <br />Other ESSENTIALS include Sorry, Future Lovers, How High, Isaac, and Push.  The rest are not to be forgotteneither. <br /> <br />Two tracks who didn't make the cut are Super Pop (available as a download for Icon Fanclub members only) and Fighting Spirit (to be released on the Special Edition in December).  I haven't heard either so I can't comment, although it's fair to say they'll be spectacular. <br /> <br />The best dance album ever made?  Perhaps.  In its full glory, Confessions shines outward to become something more than \\"just a dance record\\" -- the odd thing is, it has substance, variety, and replay value.  The album is oozing with self-discipline in audio form.  Its editing and production values are off the charts with producer/dj Stuart Price and Ciccone at the helm.  <br /> <br />The woman could single-handedly pick up all \\"modern\\" teeny-bopper \\"pop stars\\", bunch them together in a ball with her bare hands, and kick them down the stairs.  Everyone needs to realize the reason WHY modern pop as a genre exists, and why women in general, as entertainers, have had sexuality opened up to them.  Even after she's gone, Madonna will reign the charts and make the masses groove.    <br /> <br />The day Madonna dies will be a dark, dark day. <br /> <br />5 Stars and Absolutely No Regrets. <br /> <br />All hail the Queen of Pop. Amen.   <br />   <br /> <br />
0679731369|4.0|...but not all that affective. Which is not a bad thing at all. Unless there are noble attempts at such a thing, which, I suppose, is really up to debate with this work. But what expectations can one have with a work like this? What the reader has here is not really a \\"novel\\" but something greater, something post-, something meta- (although in a bearable way, at least Barnes has taste). It is, however, quite educational, very witty, very stylish (in a good way, see \\"Barnes has taste\\" in the previous sentence for more on this) but also often quite maladroit, even if in a skillfull way. Sometimes, especially in the times when the focus is shifted to the narrator, it feels like the story is being poked into an uncomfortable position, before it returns to its natural form in the next chapter (like the metal in braces!). But, it is, at the very least, a rewarding book and at the best quite brilliant. Very muchso indeed.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|There is not a single song that can be described as bad on this album. Sure, the background singing in TELL HER TONIGHT is terrible, but besides that, what is there to complain about?    Jaqueline--This song starts out slow and soft and you're not sure if you care to listen to the rest of the song. But 40 seconds into the song, it picks up and turns itself into an awesome rock song with some serious guitar playing and drumming. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.    Tell Her Tonight--While this song is the worst song on the album, it still maintains not being bad nevertheless. The \\"home demo\\" on the album DARTS OF PLEASURE, however, is so bad that it's hilarious. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.    Take Me Out--This was the song that Franz Ferdinand performed on one of the worst episodes of Saturday Night Live that I've ever seen that got me into the band's music. The awesome lead guitar and great tune are perfection. A must to hear. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.    The Dark Of The Matinee--The best song on the album. It even outdoes TAKE ME OUT. The lyrics are a bit soft, but the chorus is awesome and so is the music. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.    Auf Achse--This is the softest song on the album, and it still is good nevertheless. The singing, piano, and bass all add up to make a good song. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.    Cheating On You--This fast paced song is probably better than TELL HER TONIGHT, but nothing else on the album. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.    This Fire--A very good song. Very fast paced, though not nearly as much as CHEATING ON YOU. The drums go very good with the guitar rythem. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos, Nick McCarthy, and Paul Thompson.    Darts Of Pleasure--This song is also very good, but not quite as much as THIS FIRE. It transits well between the soft rock and the hard rock. Featuring vocals by AlexKapranos and Paul Thomson.    Michael--This song was based on an experience of a friend of the band's. It has good rock, especially the lead guitar playing. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.    Come On Home--A relatively good song, though the chorus isn't that great. It's no match for TAKE ME OUT or THE DARK OF THE MATINEE, but it's still a good song. Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy    40'--I was first introduced to this song from the trailer of IN GOOD COMPANY, and recognized it immediately when I heard it. It's a pretty good song, featuring the soon-to-become- frequent la-la-la-la-la-las. (They are featured frequently in the next Franz Ferdinand album, YOU COULD HAVE IT SO MUCH BETTER). Featuring vocals by Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy.
0060764899|3.0|As far as I can tell, this edition has NO illustrations, is in chronological order, and appears to have over-commercialized \\"extras\\".
0679746048|5.0|This book is composed of individual chapters touching on specific residents or incidents during Kaysen's tenure in a 1960's mental hospital.  Each can stand on its own, and the order isn't of any particular significance, but combined into a whole, this is a remarkably touching memoir.  Kaysen was extremely perceptive and able to share so much about life inside a mental hospital.<br /><br />At the same time that Kaysen was offering her perceptions on the inner workings of a mental hospital and its patients, she seemed remarkably confused about her own condition.  She presents evidence to let the reader ponder the question for most of the book.  We know the doctor who committed her only saw her briefly, and for another condition, but did he need to see her longer?  When Kaysen got out and read the DSM of Mental Disorders, she decided she fit borderline personality perfectly.  But was it the diagnosis du jour in the 1960's?  Kaysen presents evidence on both sides, but ultimately leaves it up to the reader to decide.  For most of the book, though, the reader observes her world inside McLean; she saves the critical analysis of herself for one of the final chapters.<br /><br />Kaysen's writing is absolutely beautiful.  A typical chapter would tell a story for a few pages and then end with a zinger of an observation.  This is a book to read in one setting, and treasure again and again.
0064409422|5.0|Because of the way Amazon links various editions, this review is different depending on what page you are looking at.<br /><br />Paperback \\"Full-Color Collector's\\" -<br />Quoting from the copyright page: For the first time this book is available with full-color complete interior illustrations by Pauline Baynes. Wow, all I was looking for was the Puffin B&W complete illustrations! Peeking into the book I see blank spaces where illustrations ought to be, but it says *some* illustrations are not shown, so I feel sure they are there & complete.  The publisher implies the numbering is chronological, but I can't see an actual number on the book in the picture.<br /><br />Hardcover - Obviously not illustrated by Pauline Barnes, I have not looked inside.<br /><br />Any Other - I have not looked individually, yet, sorry.
0743454529|2.0|This book has gotten a lot of buzz in bookstores, and the subject matter is a heck of a draw-a baby is genetically engineered to be a donor for her cancer-stricken sister, and as a teenager, that baby rebels and sues her parents.  Great premise!<br /><br />The book falls short in everything else but the premise.  The characters are surprisingly one-dimensional.  Anna, our main character, has no sense of purpose, no direction, no consistency.  Perhaps we can't expect all that much from a 13-year old.  But it certainly isn't realistic for an attorney to put up with the fact that she radically changes her mind every other day.  Nor would an attorney have gone to court on her behalf without consulting her extensively about her side of the story.  No \\"surprises\\" should arise in the courtroom if her attorney has done his job.<br /><br />Ahh, the implausibility.  Anna's mom is a lawyer who hasn't practiced for 15 year but goes into trial on her own behalf?  No judge would allow that.  As a lawyer, this woman would examine her husband on the stand for the first time, instead of conversing with him beforehand?  The book was dreamy, sensationalist, and unrealistic in many of the courtroom aspects.<br /><br />The drama in this book was dragged on far too long.  Lawyer Campbell's \\"secret\\" was ridiculous and should never have lasted 15 years with the love of his life.  The twist between the sisters was a nice way to wrap up the story, and it explained why everything didn't make sense earlier, but it shouldn't have taken 370 pages and an extensive court trial to arrive there.
B000BVD460|1.0|Like my title says, it is obvious that there was absolutely no effort put into this release. The tracks were ripped directly from his previous releases. For example, at the beginning of \\"The Way I Am\\" you hear part of the Steve Berman clip from when this song was released on the Marshall Mathers LP. I think they threw some guy in a room with the CDs and a computer and told him to pick random songs for this release. The \\"unreleased\\" tracks are of questionable caliber and add nothing to the Shady library. From one hardcore Eminem fan to another: Don't waste your money on this.
B00005JLR8|5.0|Film-making at its finest is a simple and beautiful story, told in images and carefully placed words spoken by believable, thoughtful actors.<br /><br />This was film-making at its finest.<br /><br />It's the story of a family of four (parents and two bright, beautiful daughters) from Ireland who illegally emigrate to New York City after losing a son.<br /><br />I like it even more knowing that the screenplay was written by the director (Jim Sheridan) with his two daughters.<br /><br />If the scene near the end with the father on the fire escape with his girls looking at the moon doesn't make you cry, then you'd better ask the Wizard for a heart!
B00005JKZV|1.0|It may not repeatedly put me to sleep like other movies have, but this film definitely is the most slow-paced, boring film in existence.  Remember all the thrilling scenes where Frodo and the gang narrowly escaped death, or the excellent battle scenes from the first movie?  There is nothing, repeat, nothing at all like that in this one.  Pretty much 96% of the film is talking.  That's it.  Aragorn and the others are talking with some ruler about Christopher Lee's character(whose name I forget) invading, Frodo and Sam are just talking over and over to Gollum that he should be on their side, and Merry and Pip are talking with some giant trees to help them fight Christopher Lee's character.  Well, I just described the entire movie in one sentence!  Talking, talking, talking.  Would it kill somebody to do something in this film!?  Literally, nothing important ever happens in this movie.  Aside from all the boring talking going on, here's a 20-minute battle at the end, but it doesn't really accomplish all that much.  Peter Jackson should head back to film school, or if he's never been there, enroll in it.
B0000797IO|4.0|I'm not going to talk about whether or not this was a vehicle for Jennifer Aniston or even the microcosm that was Retail Rodeo.<br /><br />The appeal of this film is its ability to capture desperation. We've all felt stuck in a rut. We've all regretted decisions. And we've all, at one point or another, been a Holden Caulfield. Maybe not to the extent that Jake Gyllenhal's character brought him to, but we've felt disenfranchised, misunderstood, pledged our love, written letters, and pretended to be someone we weren't.<br /><br />The story of marriage, and who captures your mind and your heart, and keeps your attention, is told well, too. How can there still be romance and mystery if you're talking about house paint and trying to get pregnant?<br /><br />There's always something that seems better, just beyond the walls of your everyday life. It rarely is. It's just different.<br /><br />Some people might find this too depressing (or maybe too real) to have in their collection, but I think it's worth the investment. I've watched mine more than a couple of times.
B00005U8EM|5.0|Of the thousands of movies I've seen in my life, this is my favorite.  It works on the level of fanatasy, humor, and most importantly, spirituality.  The cleverness of the plot and Bill Murray's comic acting hold your interest throughout, and it isn't until the very end that the profound spiritual message of the movie becomes apparent:  true happiness comes from selflessness, not selfishness.<br /><br />Of course, the nearest religious analogy of living the same day over and over and over until you get it right, is to Buddhism and other eastern religions that believe in reincarnation.  We Christians believe that we have only this one life to get it right, and then face the judgment.  But the message that selflessness and service to others provides true fulfillment and happiness is equally applicable to Christianity.  In fact, service to others is the very heart of the redeemed Christian life, the Christian's response to salvation in Christ.
B00005JNZJ|5.0|This is X-Men meets Matrix. Or... this is what the Next Generation movies could have been.<br /><br />And my interpretation of the bad reviews: that stuffy old white men who write the reviews (Ebert, etc) don't understand edgy movies. They didn't understand Matrix at first, either.<br /><br />I didn't know there was a series before I saw the movie. People who say it didn't make sense at first are too used to brainless Hollywood flicks, serving you a formulaic plot on a platter.<br /><br />This plot was not difficult to understand - the movie asks for your patience the first 30 minutes, as the story unfolds. It's a futuristic mystery, people! Get real - how lazy must you be if you lose interest because everything isn't explained immediately. It's a mildly (and pleasantly) complex story. If you want a Steven Siegal or Schwarzenegger action flick, look elsewhere.<br /><br />And only the first half of the movie is the \\"mystery\\". It takes about an hour for the plot, the characters, and the futuristic setting to unfold. Then the movie evolves into a stunning action flick.<br /><br />Thing I loved about this movie:<br /><br />-Srong female characters<br /><br />-Excellent soundtrack<br /><br />-Extremely interesting visually<br /><br />-Extremely creative sci-fi contributions (like the arm-to-leg transplants)<br /><br />-Thoughtful cinematography<br /><br />-A very strong cast<br /><br />-Artistic sets & effects<br /><br />-Creative weapons & futuristic props<br /><br />-A truly unique story - it didn't try to copy anything (which probably confused the Hollywood lemmings out there)<br /><br />My only complaint - it needed more in spots. Particularly, more character development for other members of the resistance. If you've seen it...I believe they jumped the gun getting to the last \\"sniper\\" scene. I wanted them to invest more time developing the animosity between Aeon Flux & the resistance movement.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I'm hoping for a sequel. And I hope Ms Theron doesn't get depressed about some of the bad reviews. This is *nothing* like Catwoman (as Ebert said). My humble prediction: it will turn into a cult classic.t some of the bad reviews. This is *nothing* like Catwoman (as Ebert said). My humble prediction: it will turn into a cult classic.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|And get some sleep, dude.  Nothing like going sleepless for an entire year while operating heavy, slicing-and-dicing equipment.  Yet zombie-like Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) does just that as he stumbles through a hazy, macabre existence in the skin-crawling film THE MACHINIST.<br /><br />It doesn't take long for the viewer to figure out Trevor has got some skeletons in his closet (not to mention a skeletal appearance).  Is there something from his past trying to clamor (or even squirt) to the mercurial forefront, or is Trevor merely seeing things as he collects a one-way ticket to Looney Land?  The story is bizarre, creepy, and a tad uneven, yet director Brad Anderson (interviewed extensively in the DVD special features) delivers an eery, tacky tale.<br /><br />For his role as a stressed out insomniac, Christian Bale shriveled to corpse-like dimensions; heck, my left leg (make that my left thigh) weighed more than this guy.  Watching him is uncomfortable to say the least, but his gaunt appearance is effective.  Equally good is Jennifer Jason Leigh as Stevie, a compassionate lady of the evening who befriends Trevor; John Sharian, a Marlon Brando look-a-like, grins and giggles wickedly as Ivan, a surreal coworker and tormentor of Trevor's.  Augmented by a spooky woodwind soundtrack as restless as a spider on a hot stove, THE MACHINIST excels in giving out a plethora of the weebie-geebies. But you might want to cut back on the caffeine--at least enough to get two hours of sleep a week.<br /><br />--D. Mikels
0743487583|5.0|I was required to read this book in college for my information technology & society course. At first I was hesitant, for I was not generally a fan of books that I was required to read in class, with the exception of \\"The Importance of Being Earnest.\\" However, I found that, as with \\"Earnest\\", I was pleasantly surprised. I became so absorbed in the book that it only took me two days to read it. \\"Frankenstein\\" is a story that questions ethics, society and relationships. It is dark in the same way as \\"Dracula,\\" but unlike \\"Dracula\\", which is also a fine book, there is an undertone of tenderness and sadness. The monster and Dr. Frankenstein both become neither hero nor villain, and the reader finds themself wondering whose side to choose.
0670033375|4.0|Not nearly as good a read as \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" but still an interesting and higly relevant book.   <br /> <br />The book suffers from poor organization. In particular, points and facts are restated again and again.  According to Diamond the book derived from his lecture notes for a college course he instructed. In my option the editing job of converting the notes to a book is incomplete.
B000BJS4BM|2.0|As soon as I saw the video for \\"Hung Up\\", my first thoughts were that Madonna was copying Kylie Minogue!  When I heard she was into Kylie, I knew for sure this was a rip-off.  Kylie Minogue is the  best at club music........Madonna used to have club music and then strayed.  Kylie has a fantastic body and is beautiful, and I personally think Madonna is trying to replicate that look....especially now that Kylie is ill.  Madonna is no Kylie in my opinion.  It is not that both stars produce high-quality music, but the tunes can be catchy for some.  Past Hung Up, I think the songs just don't cut it. What is interesting to me is that Madonna does not allow her kids to watch tv and I wonder if they can listen to her music or any music?  Her son and daughter will be in for the shock of their lives when they watch her videos or read her SEX book......funny, people shield their kids from her and now she is shielding her own children from the rest of the world......those are the ones who turn out the w ildest!  I wouldn't waste my money on this CD...and I can't believe Madonna has now joined everyone else marketing herself with a 44 page book and journal!
B0000025FG|4.0|It`s probably hard to put this CD in to a certain category, but i would like to called it \\"symphodisco\\" . First of all this one has one of the greatest covers i know, which shows something of an arabian fantasy. Jeff Lynne is a great songwriter, that gives you something of  an \\"out of space experience\\" when you listen to track after track.  Track 5 Last Train to London, is my all time ELO hit``and shows you how a hit song should sound like. Track 6 the beautiful and sentimental MIdnight Blue is also included too. There are some tracks here that doesn`t make it to the top, but anyway the real Lynne rock and roller is included here Track 9 Don`t Bring me Down.  A very good CD this one, but not ELO`s greatest.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Of the two major SOAD releases this year, I personally like this one a lot more. For me, what pushes Hypontize from 4 to 5 is the more consistent tone. It rocks from end to end, whereas Mesmerize has quieter moments. SOAD is great in those moments, but I think the momentum on Hyp is a lot better modulated.<br /><br />I almost didn't give this 5 stars because the guitarist, God love him, should stick up to backup vocals. His voice isn't bad at all -- it just doesn't mesh like Tankian's masculine spasticness does. It works well on the title track, in my opinion, but he simply sounds too juvenile compared to the rest of the sound, which is decidedly muscular and punchy.<br /><br />I have to say though, that terra cotta pie is damnable thing to get drilled into your brain right after diving into the fantastic and chilling \\"Holy Mountains,\\" probably the most epic song SOAD has crafted. Terra cotta terra cotta... ack!! \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" might have been better off as the last track. Or a hidden track. Or not on the album :p<br /><br />While \\"Stealing Society\\" felt a little unimaginative, and \\"Lonely Day\\" was pretty emo for my tastes, I find something to enjoy out of every other track on the album. On \\"Tenative,\\" it's the gorgeous harmonizing on the chorus and refrain, and the haunting lyrics -- listen close for a pronoun change when they talk about falling bombs. On \\"U-Fig,\\" it's the hilarious dynamic changes, which I picture jarring the squares out of their seats. \\"Soldier Side,\\" the most approachable track on the album in my opinion, is once again edgy with the lyrics, gorgeous on the harmoning, and haunting with those minor chords.<br /><br />Oh, and these guys will metal your socks off, too.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I now have a tattoo of 1Cor13 on my back right shoulder...it is the most beautiful writing i've ever heard...\\"if i have the faith to move mountains, but have not love, i am nothing...love is not arrogant, does not take account of wrongs, love does not rejoice in revenge...when i was a child, i thought as a child, i spoke as a child, now, that i am a man, i have put my childish ways behind me...now, I see a distorted image in the mirror, but when I know love, know the perfect, I will see clearly again...faith, hope, and love remain, of these, love is the greatest...\\"  this is paraphrased for easier understanding, but Paul wrote this to the Corinthians, and it says all anyone needs to know; along with the gospel of James (be a doer, not a sayer of the faith)...anyhow, the movie is very realistic with beautiful filming and passionate acting...the scene with DeNiro's redemption is cheap to put into words...
B000003TAW|4.0|I'm not sure that this album's impact was entirely realized when it came out back in 1994.  While grunge bands were in full swing testing the limits of \\"music\\" with heavy reverb and little substance, Weezer showed up with something completely new.  They showed that it was in fact possible to write good songs with catchy melodies while still keeping your amp's cranked up to eleven.<br /><br />The opening track \\"My Name Is Jonas\\" starts off with a pretty acoustic riff before hitting you in the face with a jackhammer of electric guitar.  The two sounds compete throughout the remainder of the song.  \\"No One Else\\" is an uptempo rocker with a catchy chorus, and \\"The World Has Turned And Left Me Here\\" follows in Jonas' footsteps but has a better melody.  \\"The Sweater Song\\" and \\"Buddy Holly\\" were the radio hits.  \\"Surfwax America\\" is another pounding rock nugget, and \\"Say It Ain't So\\" is a sad yet beautiful song that still finds room for a fantastic, loud riff in the chorus.  \\"In The Garage\\" is another song with an easy, catchy melody, and \\"Holiday\\" might be the highlight of the album, where Weezer flexes every rock and harmonic muscle.  \\"Only In Dreams\\" is a slow-tempo closer featuring heavy guitars struggling to stay under wraps.<br /><br />\\"Weezer\\" is a fantastic album that sounds as fresh today as it did during its heyday.  Looking back, the album signalled that something new was brewing in rock 'n roll that eventually put grunge out to pasture.  Give the album a listen and then write down how many other bands have copied this formula...the list is staggering.
B0006IJ5PM|5.0|I played lacrosse in a state-ranked town, where the kids all grew up walking around with sticks, dreaming of a state championship and trying to get a lax scholarship.  the high school coach would call us at home when we were in elementary school if we didn't show up to box lacrosse on sunday. you had to hang out with the players on the team, you had a curfew on game night, and everyone associated you as \\"a lacrosse player\\"...it was the worst, no fun at all, it was a business, no place for kids...i quit my senior year, giving up a sure scholarship and scoring prestige...but i left with my sanity and lived my life the way i wanted...needless to say, this movie is what happens...the pressure is unreal for the kids, they just wanna be kids...i understand why the coaches do this, cause' it works, conform or get lost...that is, unless, you are a star player, and you get special treatment...i know more than half of us got arrested in the 95-96 year...they had to change the sports handbook to adjust for athletes getting arrested 3 months before the season starts...hahahaha...insanity...
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Every generation or two, there appears a wunderkind director who changes all the rules. There was Orson Wells, Steven Spielberg, and now there's Peter Jackson.    When I first heard that Jackson would follow up the Lord of the Rings trilogy with a remake of King Kong, I was really curious and interested to see what it would be like, but also wondered what he could bring new to the project. As time went by and things leaked out, I rode a roller coaster of anticipation and trepidation. Some of the story changes and casting concerned me.    Well, now it's out and I have to say Jackson nailed it! This is a big, long movie with as much heart as special effects. Note that this review ontains  some minor spoilers. Still, there's really very little in this that you might not already know by watching the original and reading some of the press releases put out while this KK was in production.    Roger Ebert said that Naomi Watts deserves an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Ann Darrow and I must concur. Just as impressive is Andy Serkis, this time doing Kong instead of Gollum. The movie changes the nature and relationship of the other major characters from both the original and the disappointing 1976 remake. All of the changes make the movie more coherent and better explain why the characters act as they do. What wasn't changed was the time period. This Kong, like the original, takes place in 1933 - a wise decision based on 20/20 hindsight and the 1976 remake. There are even a couple of cute lines and scenes which reference the original movie.    The Carl Denham character is probably the most poorly cast, but it still works well. In both of the previous versions, Carl Denham is simply a two dimensional character - a promoter in the original and a corporate villain of the 1976 version. In Jackson's vision, Denham is a promoter, alright, but Jackson doesn't shy away from showing how callous, manipulative, exploitative, and self-serving he is. He is truly the most evil character in the show. In the end, you know it really wasn't beauty that killed the beast, it was Carl Denham. Of course, this was true in the previous versions, but it was never as obvious as it is here. Even his \\"It was beauty killed the beast\\" line merely highlights the fact that he's so self serving that he really doesn't get it and never will.    Ann Darrow isn't an improbably hired off-the-street girl Denham picks to star in his movie, as in the original. Neither is she the bubble-headed actress of the 1976 remake. She's a vaudeville performer who's just lost her job (it does take place in the Great Depression, after all). She aspires to be an actress, but as we first see her has almost sunk to the level of considering a burlesque job. She has feelings and depth. As events play out on Skull Island, she uses her vaudeville skills to divert Kong. After Kong saves her life multiple times, she forms a complex bond with him. She shows him kindness and understanding, and he becomes her protector. As the relationship develops, you see it as typical of the bond that people have with their pets. Only in this case, they're both pets of one another.    Jack Driscoll in Jackson's movie is a writer rather than a ship's mate, which makes the developing romance between him and the showgirl Ann Darrow more believable. He's also deliberately not physically the hero type, which makes his heroism all the more impressive.    By the time, Denham returns with Kong to NYC, both Ann and Jack have washed their hands of the whole deal. Denham, true to his sleazy personality, reenacts events on the island with some generic blonde he could pay scale to stand in for Ann Darrow. That it's not really Ann doesn't stop Denham from introducing her as Ann, \\"the bravest girl I've ever known.\\" One added character is Bruce Baxter, a matinée idol actor and Ann's costar in Denham's film. A hero on screen, he's basically a coward who discovers just enough of a real hero inside him to save the day at a critical moment on the island. Unfortunately, he reverts to his vain, preening self once they return to civilization, taking his place alongside the bogus Ann Darrow as one of the \\"heroes\\" of the expedition.    The rest of the details are vintage Kong, but on steroids. The famous spider pit scene cut from the original is put back in. Instead of a single T.Rex to fight, Kong has three to fight simultaneously with only one hand since the other one holds Ann Darrow. Instead of a few dinosaurs, we get herds of Jurassic Park quality beasts. One delightful scene has Kong playing on the Central Park ice rink with Ann Darrow - one brief playful moment whose spell is broken by artillery fire.    This film succeeds on every level it attempts. It's a great action movie, but also a great love story with real heart and a message to convey about the nature of love and loyalty.
0553801503|1.0|I loved the first three books in this series, couldn't put them down. I waited on pins and needles for months, following the official website, dreaming of what this book might contain. I'm so dissappointed, I could cry. It's slow, boring, and did I say slow? I can appreciate detail, but when the detail has no purpose, and goes on and on for pages,then it's easy to put the book down (not a good characteristic for a novel). If I hadn't spilled taco sauce all over it, I would return it.
B00004TRD8|5.0|Well I am not going to review the movie because you probably already know how great it is. Instead I will just speak for this edition of the movie- The Ultimate Edition DVD. Whether you get the dual disc set or the dual sided single disc set makes no difference since the same content is on each pressing.  <br /> <br />Ok now for the technical stuff. This is the best edition of the movie to own for several reasons:  <br /> <br />1.) DTS! Forget Dolby Digital, there is a night and day difference when you watch a movie in DTS and this is a fine example of what a film should sound like. DTS makes much better use of the center and surround speakers. The Dolby version just drowns them all together. Also the Extreme edition does not have the DTS track, only the Ultimate.  <br />2.) You get all three versions of the film on one disc! Theatrical, Special and the Extended Special version. The third version was cut from the Extreme edition (probably due to inconsistency with T3 being released that same summer) and the Theatrical can only be seen in HDTV via a super fast computer on the Extreme edition. With the Ultimate edition you get it all without the need of fancy super expensive computers and a small screen.  <br />3.) Extras! There are so many extras on the second disc I can almost promise that if you were sick, you could sit in front of your TV and by the time you finish watching all the bonus material that you will be over your cold/flu/fever lol. Those of you with \\"The Abyss\\" (white box) know what I'm talking about.  <br />4.) Last but not least is the neat metal case cover this Ultimate ed comes in. It is aluminum; I repeat aluminum not tin like the Extreme edition's (which had a tendency to rip the case's spine and artwork). Aluminum is more expensive than paper so granted they only made the first production with the aluminum, but they can still be found. I would be perfectly happy with the paper case cover, after all you are mainly concerned about the movie right-not the case cover lol.  <br /> <br />So there you have it, several reasons why the Ultimate edition is the best version of the movie to have on DVD. To play the Extended Special version, you will need to enter a code for the Easter egg to work. This is very easy, with the timeline menu up and running, click on the special edition choice. Then with \\"play special edition\\" highlighted, enter 82997 (August 29, 1997 for J-Day) somewhat quickly and you will hear a sound effect while the other eye of the Terminator T800 lights up and now you will see a third menu at the top saying \\"play extended special edition\\". Now both eyes of the T800 are light up and at the right in yellow you will see \\"THE FUTURE IS NOT SET\\" and that's it. There are a few Easter eggs on the bonus disc as well. You can search Yahoo or Google to find those. Enjoy. <br /> <br />Since Amazon sometimes mixes up the different editions of the same movie, I will mention a little about the Extreme version. It says is is from a brand new film transfer, but comparing my girlfriend's Extreme ed. to my Ultimate ed. I could tell no difference. Also the Extreme is very lacking in the extras department. However the HighDefinition (disc 2) is really neat and a big difference in quality over the normal 480i version. But it just takes a fast computer and a good display to reap the benefit Artisan and Van Ling wanted to provide you.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I constantly needed ZEP fuel at that age, and to think that these recordings were just floating around somewhere, unavailable to me! DAMN! Meanwhile I was wasting my time with WALKING INTO CLARKSDALE (remember that heef?) trying to satisfy the ZEPPELIN addiction. Ok, CLARKSDALE wasn't terrible, I got to see PAGE AND PLANT perform live for that album, and it of course was incredible! But I had already spun all the ZEPPELIN I could find. CHRIST, they hadn't even released BBC SESSIONS yet. How was I supposed to talk to hot chicks without some ZEP pounding into  my headphones and possessing me with those insane hormones unknown to me ever since? SONG REMAINS THE SAME? Forget it. That stuff was weak, well at least not what I needed.<br /><br />Now, seven years later they've  delivered HOW THE WEST WAS WON. My cousin Joe took some time to come around to ZEPPELIN. He's still rather new, and this is one of the first albums he purchased. I was listening to it in his car and was ROCKING! \\"We gotta go find some HOT chicks!\\" I screamed over the heavy volume half of disc one.<br /><br />If you are familiar with SONG REMAINS.. you can expect to find almost the same formula on the second two discs... A lengthy DAZED, a medly of blues WHOLE LOTTA LOVE. But the stuff does have its own identity here, which it certainly didn't have on SONG REMAINS. The former was released in the seventies and was for the teens of the day to put on while remeniscing about the killer ZEPPELIN shows they may have seen. Nowadays teens have to use their imaginations a bit, and well, this set will send them soaring! Very colorful, and much recommended for anyone whos between the ages of 14-18. (Also recommended for ANYONE else who wants to ROCK!)
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|okay, this CD is pretty rad, Darron sings alot in it and its pretty awesome, \\"BYOB\\" got really popular, and that song gets in my nerves alittle now....but they have other songs on this album that kickass...like \\"Violent Pornography\\" \\"Question!\\" and \\"Cigaro\\"...Cigaro has funny lyrics....and Darron sings in it....get it if you like System of a D-izz-own...
B0000640SA|4.0|\\"Regression\\"<br /><br />I picked this topic to speak on when I remembered laughing at myself the night my film class and I watched Memento, a movie based on Memento Mori, the name of the short story.  I turned up my car music, left the place, and headed the wrong direction on the highway, \\"idiot!\\"  I was so used to going to my friend's house; my car just automatically steered me into going the opposite direction of my home.  He wouldn't be available that week, and I knew this because I had just spoken with him by cell phone before getting into my car.  Yet, I'm not so sure I have no explanation.  After watching Memento, I realized the satire of going through motions that have no memory.  I laughed out loud, alone, and in my car when I realized the occasion.<br /><br />I remember Leonard Shelby.  He is the main character of Memento.  Leonard Shelby had a memory dysfunction.  I don't suppose I acted much differently than Leonard Shelby.  Leonard Shelby escaped an asylum!  Memento is the story of a guy that can have a conversation with someone and, by the end of it, did not know what was said at the beginning of it.  By the time he got done with the movie, he was quite a unique individual.  His actions were attributable to a memory dysfunction.<br /><br />Movie critics are important to movies.  They make important decisions in front of viewers or readers everywhere.  They affect a film's interpretation.  They are so engaging, they occasionally get to be Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin.<br /><br />Some people prefer to remember the instances they choose, like when a wife receives insulin.  She must be diabetic.

B0002S94OS|4.0|This CD is alright, i listened to it alot, and still love it....Randy is a great screamer, he vocals are just in your face, non-stop screaming, its just brutal....hes lyrics are awesome too \\"Now You've Got Something To Die For\\" is a good song, and other songs are good (too lazy to type them out)  <br />it was a pretty good buy, so get it, and you might be disappointed, and you might not, depends how you like your metal
0553582445|4.0|Yes, Hobb is one of the best fantasy writers and yes this book sheds some light on the other trilogies, and you get to know what happened after that, BUT I'm slightly disappointed in the end. Perhaps three books are a little bit much for the amount of story available, the pace is not what I've come to expect. However, if you've read the other books, this is a must have anyway. If you haven't read the other trilogies, do that first. They are both great and lives more on their own merit in contrast to this trilogy that relies heavily on the fact that we know the history of the characters. In summary, a good trilogy even if it is not her best.
B0002OERI0|3.0|alright, i got this the first day it came out thinking it was gonna be completely kickass, well, i thought it was for a long time, my favorite song was \\"Blvd. of Broken Dreams\\", that is before it got a video and was played on MTV, MTV2, VH1, and Fuse 24/7, along with \\"Holiday\\", \\"American Idiot\\", and \\"Wake Me Up When Sept. Ends\\" (which sucked from the begining), there are some pretty badass songs on here like \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\", \\"Homecoming\\" and \\"Give Me Novacaine\\"...\\"St. Jimmy\\" is an alright song, but it gets annoying...everyone is ranting and raving about this album, even old Green Day fans are, well i am an old Green Day fan and i was, but not anymore....\\"Bullet In A Bible\\" made me kinda loose all respect for them...plus you see people wear there shirts left and right, ....everyone LOOOOVES this CD....well if you want a f*ckin badass CD then go listen to Dookie or International Superhits, or Nimrod, all great classic Green Day albums....they were kinda in an out of the shadows with every album, Dookie was out, and they were pretty popular, Insominac came out and not soo popular, Nimrod came out and was pretty popular, and then Warning..then Shnagains (however you spell it) wasnt even really meantioned, but it was an alright CD \\"Haha, You're Dead\\" was on it, and thats a good song overall, if you dont have it, you are probably the only on in the world that doesnt, and dont get it....its waaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy over-rated
B00005R2M3|5.0|I'm a big Shakira fan as you probably don't know. I would totally rat a tat tat it, and that is what I'm talking about. I'm biligual and smoother than a fresh stretch of assfault. Shaq's voice is really good and did I mention she is a tasy morsel. Give to me some Shakira and coke.  <br /> <br />Speaking of laundry, I've got to break things down on the laundromat tip for my peeps. I was in Murfreesboro over the weekend headlining a show with my faster pussycat cover band, rapido kitty. You should see the crowd when I belt out \\"house of pain\\" with Kroll shredding guitar, Burns playing keyboard like he's playing it to stop a natural disaster and Jabs putting on a drum display so good they should just freeze him, ship him to Cleveland and make him an exhibit on how to play the drums at the Rock n' roll hall of fame. We have a tour bus with some bad ass cat paintings on it. Anyway, we partied with a bunch of cover model type women until the wee hours of the morning and my clothes smelled like a combo of bourbon, chicken wings and women.  <br /> <br />So we head to Duds and Suds to do some laundry. Women were lined up at the door because they heard we'd be doing some laundry there. Well, the kid running the place, Ted, opened up and got the machines ready. At that point, Ted snapped into form. He started playing his purple gameboy behind the counter while eating some Mickey Ds. He evidentally thought some of our groupies were hot and felt the need to go to uber dork mode to hit on one of them. He actually started off by saying, \\"Have you played the Xbox 360? Madden is awesome, you can give your players IQ tests and everything.\\" It was time for us to step in. Jabs just walked over and called the kid the largest tool he had ever seen in his life and told him that if he didn't quit bothering Sarah, he would throw the kid in a washing machine and start. Ted apologized and said he would leave us alone. I personally didn't like the face he made when he said it, so I crane kicked him into the counter. Sarah and I then handled business on the counter while Ted was bawling because he stepped on his gameboy and broke it. People like Ted deserve that kind of treatment. We are the Heisman and Ted is the towel boy for Kst.
B00005MP58|1.0|I must agree with the other reviewer who complained of the picture quality.The packaging claims this version has been digitally remastered -- I can only conclude it has been remastered to make it look cr*p. <br /> <br />The picture is very washed out indeed -- it seems to improve slightly on the second disc (or maybe my brain was adjusting.) To add insult to injury -- \\"the special\\" featurette contains footage from the unremastered version and you realize how lush the colors should be. <br /> <br />Even jiggling with the color/contrast/brightness does not restore the detail you know should be in the picture.The picture quality is so disappointing that I even wondered if I had purchased a bootleg copy by mistake. I urge A&E to recall the discs and do the job properly -- the only reason I give this product any stars at all is because you can still hear the excellent script!
0930289455|5.0|I bought this as a present for a friend and myself back in 1988 and while the story is no doubt one of the best ever written GNs to expound upon the Joker, it doesn't warrant these price tags.  This graphic novel has been REPRINTED 6 TIMES!!!! I'm just shaking my head looking at what these vendors are asking. \\"Price-gouging\\" is the word that comes to mind. I'm into collecting comics as much as the next guy, but this is classic artificial demand placed on this comic due to the success of the Hollywood film Batman Begins.  A CGC graded Killing Joke may be worth the $35.00 you'd pay for it, but these aren't even graded.   <br />In the end, I concur with every review written, this graphic novel is one to add to your collection if you can find it at a reasonable price.  <br /> <br />I would, however, strongly suggest to anyone considering purchasing this graphic novel to consider the upcoming \\"DC UNIVERSE: THE STORIES OF ALAN MOORE\\" being released Jan. 11, 2006 which will include for the first time ever in trade paperback, The Killing Joke along with many other fantastic Alan Moore stories.
B00025ETIW|1.0|I hate to give this album one star, because that implies that there is something of value on this catastrophe of an album. I'm so very, very thankful that I din't buy this album, but instead, aquired the music through means that would anger Lars Ulrich (although I'm sure none of the people giving this album 5 stars even know who Lars Ulrich is, but I'll get to that later.) After hearing this band for the first time, I sat down, dazed and confused, and wondered \\"Why?\\"  <br /> <br />I remember a time when musicians were considered great because they were, well, great. Bands such as Nirvana, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, and the list goes on. These groups had talent; they could not only write good lyrics, but they actually knew how to play their instruments, unlike these MCR clowns. The guitarist just strums the same power chords over and over. Halfway through the album, you'll be wishing you had an ice pick in your hand, so that you can jam it in your ear, thus freeing you from the torturous grip of this...you know what? I was about to finish that sentence with the word \\"music,\\" but decided against it. <br /> <br />Because, you see, when these guys play, they do not make music, but rather, they create a raging cacophany which slowly (but surely) drives you insane. But wait! I haven't even talked about the singer yet. <br /> <br />I can't describe how horrible this guy's singing is, simply because the reviewers before me put it best when they said he sounded like he was a baby squirrel (I won't quote his full statment because it might be considered obscene by the site.)  <br /> <br />I could go on to expose the faults (and there are many) that this band (although they are more of a travesty than a band) has. However, there's nothing I could say that hasn't been said by countless intelligent reviewers before me (who also gave this album one star) so I'll leave it to them. <br /> <br />Now comes the portion of the review where I recommend to yousome albums that you should get instead of this, and a brief description of the album, as well as the best(IMO)songs on the album. Of course, you should only buy these album if you don't like listening to a bunch of prepubescent corporate sell-outs whining about how their girlfriends of one (or maybe even two, if they're lucky) weeks broke up with them. <br /> <br />1. Tool~Aenima: One of the greatest albums ever made, this is truly Tool's masterpiece. With fairly lengthy songs displaying depth and talent that have become so rare in music these days, Aenima will not dissapoint. Plus, Danny Carey is a much better drummer than the guy in MCR. <br />Best songs on album: Eulogy, Aenema, H. <br /> <br />2. Nirvana~Nevermind: For all of you who love MCR because you're an angsty teenager, this (or Nine Inch Nails'\\"The Downward Spiral\\") is the album for you. Really, the difference between Nirvana and MCR is that Nirvana's bandleader (the late great Kurt Cobain) could write both good lyrics and music, not to mention all of the musicians in this band could play amazingly well, and Kurt had a great voice. <br />Best songs on album: Smells Like Teen Spirit, Come as You Are, Lithium <br /> <br />3. Pink Floyd~Dark Side of the Moon: I can't begin to describe this album other than by saying that it's not one of the biggest selling albums of all time for no reason. Of course, you could substitute  one of Pink Floyd's other masterpieces (they had many) such as Animals or Wish You Were Here. <br />Best songs on album: Time, Money, Brain Damage <br /> <br />4. Nine Inch Nails~Downward Spiral: Sure to appeal to you if you like MCR because you think that they're angsty.  <br />Best songs on album: Closer, Piggy, Mr. Self Destruct <br /> <br />5. Black Sabbath~Paranoid: Far darker than MCR could ever hope to be, the boys of Black Sabbath created heavy metal, forever making the world a better place.  <br />Best songs on album: War Pigs, Paranoid, Iron Man <br /> <br />6. Metallica~Masterof Puppets: Remember that Lars Ulrich guy I mentioned earlier? He's the drummer in this band, and you should get either this album from them or ...And Justice for All.  <br />Best songs on album: Master of Puppets, Disposable Heroes, Welcome Home (Sanitarium) <br /> <br />In order to save space, I'm going to stop giving descriptions for the albums and just list them.  <br />6. Tool~Lateralus <br />7. Led Zeppelin~IV <br />8. Rage Against the Machine~The Battle of Los Angeles <br />9. Tool~Undertow <br />10. Metallica~...And Justice for All <br />11. Metallica~Ride the Lightning <br />12. Nirvana~In Utero <br />13. A Perfect Circle~Thirteenth Step <br />14. A Perfect Circle~Mer de Noms <br />15. Rage Against the Machine~ Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium <br />16. Pink Floyd~Animals <br />17. Pink Floyd~Wish You Were Here <br />18. Pink Floyd~The Wall <br />19. Nine Inch Nails~And All That Could Have Been <br />20. Nine Inch Nails~Pretty Hate Machine <br />21. Led Zeppelin~Houses of the Holy <br />22. Alice in Chains~Dirt <br />23. Soungarden~Superunknown <br />24. King Crimson~In the Court of the Crimson King <br />25. Jimi Hendrix~Are You Experienced? <br /> <br />There are many more albums that deserve to be mentioned, but these should be enough for now. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AL730O|5.0|Its a little different from a lot of the other stuff he's done, a little more low key and mellow, but at the same time still has his McCartney charm that is evident in every one of the tracks. Most certaintly recomended for fans.
B00005JMXX|1.0|I will give you that the special effects in the first half of the film are decent.  But the huge plot holes and stupefying dialogue just ruin any positive value in this film.  Examples:<br /><br />1.  Why is it that only the Northern Hemisphere is effected?  I would thnk that southern South America and Australia may not be happy with a new Ice Age either.  And if the climate change is caused by a shift in the North Atlantic current, why did Tokyo get pounded?<br /><br />2.  And for that matter, what a coincidence that there are three or four tornadoes on the west coast of the U.S., and they all are in downtown L.A.?<br /><br />2a.  Considering the above L.A. tornadoes, would traffic helicopters really fly around in the storms hoping to get a good shot of them?<br /><br />3.  A wall of water inundates New York City, close to 150 feet high, enough to almost cover the Statue of Liberty.  Yet interestingly this unprecedented tidal wave has no effect on Washington D.C., which sits about 10 feet above sea level.<br /><br />4.  Even though all of Manhattan is under said 150 feet of water, the pay phones still work!  And Boy Hero is able to easily get through to his parents in D.C.

Also, I never did figure if the Boy Hero pluncked in a bunch of quarters to make his call or called collect.<br /><br />4a.  During the phone call, why doesn't Boy Hero tell his parents \\"hey, the water here is up to my neck, I gotta go now?\\"<br /><br />5.

Second, why didn't the above mentioned -150 degree air, which we were told over and over would kill anything in its path, enter the library through the open fireplace flue and kill them all?<br /><br />6a.

I guess the rest of the crew didn't give a damn about their families.<br /><br />7.  At the end of the film, while leaving NYC where at least 6 million people have died, Boy Hero and Dad Hero smile because, hey, at least Boy Hero got his girl.<br /><br />I won't even get into all the bull**** science dumped on us during the film.<br /><br />8.

B00004Y6Q5|4.0|First let me say I have not listened to a ton of original movie scores. So...I'm not sure if every score is as fragmented, short, and abundant in tracks as this one. The pieces of music on this disc, though extremely short, work to PERFECTION on the screen. However, put together in a compilation like this are not as enjoyable for me. The main reason for this is the fragmented nature of the compliation I described earlier. There is no real transition or continuation between most of the tracks on this disc. But do not misunderstand, the music on this soundtrack is phenomenal. (Signature and best track is definitely 'Lux Aeterna.') <br /> <br />I say I am reviewing this album from a slightly different prespective because I listened to 'Requiem for a Dream: Remixed' before this soundtrack. In comparison to the remixed soundtrack, this soundtrack seems extremely sparse and leaves you wanting a little more in the way of longer tracks, more layering, and an overall cohesiveness to the soundtrack. <br /> <br />Conclusion: If you listen to this soundtrack and think how great all these potential samples could be used to create something more, I would suggest picking up Requiem for a Dream: Remixed. However, if your really not into 'remixes' then THIS album should definately suffice and be worth the purchase price. <br />
B000B8QEYC|5.0|The \\"Amarantine\\" flower is a good metaphor for Enya's music, which seems to blossom eternally, and especially now. This new album brings the best from Enya: it is melodical, moving and touching, more than ever. The title song is truly addicting, and my other favorites are the emotional \\"If I Could Be Where You Are\\" and \\"Sumiregusa\\", the upbeat \\"Somebody Said Goodbye\\" and the instrumental \\"Drifting\\", to name a few.  <br />And one final favorite of mine: if you like Enya's music, you will love Arye Geiman, a very romantic composer, whose music really awakens your imagination. You can listen to it at the \\"CDbaby com\\" website.
B000002GJH|5.0|How should I start? it's a great thing to realise that whether these fellas where with their original bands or in a \\"side-project\\" it was guaranteed to be great! just like Mad Season, Temple of The Dog is a get-together of some of Seattle's at the time - rising stars, Chris Cornell (vocals, Soundgarden) and Mother Love Bone's surviving members (later Pearl Jam) and Eddie Vedder as a guest (who, obviously started singing in Pearl Jam after this...). The point of this collaboration was to honour the late and great Andrew Wood (singer of Mother Love Bone..) and most of the songs are about him, if not directly about his death, then just about him, some songs fortunately have other themes, and Cornell get more \\"Soundgarden\\" on atleast such tracks as 'Your Savior'. The main weight is however on the softer, saddish and very powerful ones 'Say Hello To Heaven' which is so hopeful, that it simply wishes the best for Andy Wood up there in heaven. 'Hunger Strike' was a minimal hit, and is one of the highlights here, again a very Cornell-highlighted song, he's just awesome on this song, everybody should hear this song, is more than brilliant! 'Times of Trouble' is poppy, but so different in a way from a \\"typical\\" Cornell song, the chorus is just so dyin' magnificent, much thanks to the sensitive piano riff. The rest is grand too, but these songs are the most notable. One thing is a slightly different with TOTD compared to any other grunge line-up, these songs really sound 1991, today I really feel 1991 when I listen to these tracks, they're not as timeless in the same sense as Soundgarden's or PJ's songs, but they still sound great...a must-have for alternative fans!!
B000B8QF14|4.0|i love this CD and DVD. all the songs are great, and the director of the DVD is very talented. not only does it have the concert, but it also has interviews with people in the concert. because of this, it felt like i was actually at the concert! on the dvd, it even has a button to see a photo gallery! in all, green day is a great band and after watching this DVD/CD, it has increased my respect for them. the only thing i could say is that i wish they had more songs from their \\"american idiot\\" album, like give me novocaine, etc. Another one, from the International superhits CD that i wish they had was \\"Good Riddance(Time of your Life\\". if it had those songs, then it would be a perfect 5.
B00005JO1Y|4.0|Poor Peter Jackson, unfortunately he is sufferring an all to common fate - an overly critical audiance.  STOP comparing this film to Lord of The Rings!!!  I think fans of the LOR series have come to theatres with expectations so high that they are ultimately disapointed.  Look this is a great film, it's everything a movie going experience should be.  You are transported to a different world full of majic and mystery.  It's action, suspence, drama, humor, sci-fi, and a love story all in one.  There are Jaw dropping special effects and beautifull photography.  Some people have complained that some things look fake or there is too much CGI- Um hello it's a movie about a 25 foot gorrilla of course it's fake.  It's like those people who always critisize wrestling saying thats fake, you people just don't get it.  If you just forget about all that and go with it you will have a much better time.  It's about entertainment not realism.  Go to the theatres without any expectations but just with the hope of being entertained for a while and perhaps to escape the reality of your life for a few hours and you will have a good time.   <br /> <br />Yes I can recognize all the imperfections in the film too but I don't expect it to be perfect in the first place.  We are human, imperfect beings by nature, therefore we can never create something perfect because we have no real concept of perfection, it is something only God can know and Peter Jackson is not God but he has done a pretty good job as a director so stop critisizing sit back and enjoy, if you don't like it go to film school and try your hand at it. <br /> <br />My only real critisism is the same one I had for LOR, it's a bit too long.  Can I get an intermission to use the bathroom?
B000929AJQ|2.0|I was a pretty big Nine Inch Nails fan in high school, but in recent years my interest has faded.  Still, when Trent Reznor & co. released \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" as the first single from With Teeth, I was intrigued for two reasons: First, NIN was gunning for the watered-down modern rock crowd; second, it was still a great song despite that.<br /><br />With Teeth, however, is not that intriguing, and in fact is quite disappointing.  There are flashes of greatness, but ultimately things don't come together in the end.  You might get a couple of the songs stuck in your head, but none of them can haunt you the way songs like \\"The Becoming\\" or \\"Ruiner\\" could.<br /><br />The opener \\"All the Love in the World\\" is a nice and rather mellow track, but overstays it's welcome at more than five minutes.  \\"You Know What You Are?\\" seems to want to replicate the \\"angry\\" NIN (it reminded me in particular of \\"Big Man With a Gun\\"), with little success.  Other songs, like \\"Love is Not Enough\\" and \\"The Line Begins to Blur,\\" are purely unremarkable.<br /><br />Probably the biggest problem with this album as a whole is with vocals and lyrics- they sound like early rough cuts, not finished products.  \\"The Collector-\\" musically exhilarating thanks in part to drummer Dave Grohl- has some pretty awkward lyrics (\\"I pick things up / I am a collector / and things, well things, they tend to accumulate,\\" etc.).  And don't even get me started on the chorus on the title track- talk about awkward.  \\"Beside You In Time\\" has some *great* music, but the vocals sound too hushed and hurried, as if Reznor intended to record the proper vocals later.<br /><br />On the plus side, \\"Only-\\" as I write this the current single- is quite amazing.  It has a great beat and bassline, and angsty yet clever lyrics.  It's probably one of the most mainstream tracks from NIN, but it's still the best song on the album.  Elsewhere, \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\" has an anthemic feel and \\"Sunspots\\" and the aforementioned \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" rock hard.<br /><br />I hope we don't' have to wait another six years to hear some new NIN material, but then again, I hope Trent Reznor takes his time to write and record some songs that can stand up to his earlier triumphs.ioned \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" rock hard. <br /> <br />I hope we don't' have to wait another six years to hear some new NIN material, but then again, I hope Trent Reznor takes his time to write and record some songs that can stand up to his earlier triumphs.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|First of all....sorry 4 my english! I'm italian and this is my first review. This wants to be an answer to 2 particular reviews, one titled \\"garbage\\" and the other \\"this should've been called confessions of a no talent middle aged idoit (idiot)\\". Well, what can I say? I think this album is fantastic, not just because it's Madonna, but because it's funny, in this moment there's nothing like this. One thing has to be clear, Madonna never has pretended to be Bob Dylan, but she has always had something to say. People who bash her didn't actually listen her songs, it's just pre-concept. It makes me laugh the comparison with Mariah Carey(I have also all of her cds, including Emancipation). Madonna never self-proclaimed herself Queen of Pop. History did it, and not only because of the selling. Yes, Madonna is the biggest selling female artist of all time, but she also opened doors 4 those who followed. The first female artist with complete control of her image and products. She wasn't afraid to take risks, even if those risks could damage her career. Always opinionated. There will never be another Madonna. Want to talk about european taste regarding music? Ok! look at billboard hot 100 chart and look at UK chart....Europe=music, USA=hip/hop-rnb....America is ruled by radio....Oh my God! If radio decides that a particular artist is out, then is out....people can't choose, it's orrible. Don't tell me that Mariah carey had 4 top ten from emancipation....Ok, yes, she had them, but how much did they sell? zero. Radio decided it. You can't compare the chart achievements on billboard with no other chart, because european (and world) charts are selling charts, billboard is an airplay charts....question closed. US people is not free to buy a single, they're out of the picture. We Belong Together, 12 weeks on top. How much did it sell? zero. \\"Hung up\\" by Madonna sold tons of download, people paid for that, but it peaked at n. 7 (36th top ten hit for madonna...). Radio counts more that buying people....what are we talkin about? eheh! YOU ARE RIDICOLOUS. Mariah sold 4 million copies of emancipation....Madonna sold 4 million copies IN A WEEK! eheh! N.1 in 32 countries. After more than 20 years in the business.. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN! It looks like if an artist sells big in the us is a big artist, but (eheh) us is not the whole world guys. Take out us (if u can!) for a second....Mariah carey is nowhere near Madonna. I'm sorry 4 you, and it makes me laugh, because it seems no one has said that to you before. You can't change history. Madonna sold 350000 copies and went to number one in US with a dance album....did you realize that? You close people? before iraq war you were bashing the beautiful american life album and now, 3 years later (after seeing tha bush is an idiot) you are listening american idiot by green day? eheheheh! The whole us went against DIXIE CHICKS because of their opinion of bush....RADIO BANNED THEM. Chart achievements in American are all about radio. they went down the charts and declared a flop....you ruin people because of their opinion, land of freedom! You tried to ruin madonna's image, just because she thinks that Bush is a murderer...America life would sell 5 times more now.  <br />So it's better for you to not judge european point of view about music....what do u think? And then, mariah....yes, big big voice. The lyrics? ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah! I agree that madonna is not Bob Dylan, but telling that Mariah has better lyrics.....it's like saying that US is an open minded country! Anyway, I'm talking to people who never read a song by Madonna, so, I know that I'm wasting my time, but I'm actually having fun! eheh! the more people bash Madonna the more I have fun!! Because if she doesn't care, why should I? <br />It's fun to see people so unsicure about themselves, trying to pur down the stars of the rating of a madonna's album. That's the mission of their lives (lives?). Stop now, I have to work. I hopethis people will get a life (like me!), and I wish them the best. have fun people!! dance on Confessions! It's great! <br />It's my first review, and I had fun, I hope you forgive my mistakes with the language and my not being american (of course, because US is not a racist country, right?). I repeat it again: GOD SAVE THE QUEEN OF POP, THEN ONE (AND ONLY)....MADONNA! <br /> <br />Cheers, Ale
B000001EAQ|5.0|Well it seems that this album was misunderstood as it did not sell as much as the more recent ones, but I have to admit that I think that it is much better than what U2 did in the 2000's. <br />Actually POP is FUN, enjoyable, full of inventions (MOFO, DISCOTHEQUE), full of emotion (WAKE UP DEAD MAN)... Sure there are a few songs that are not that great, but overall this is a really good U2 album.
B00006JJ51|5.0|WTF this kid in the review below me talking about? G U-not are some gay ass wannabe gangsta clique, N.W.A. are from the 1980's so tell me this, how can they be G-unit wannabes if N.W.A came first? <br /> <br />Anyhow, this album is a great addition to any fan of gangsta rap's collection. Its the kind of album yo ucan listen to every track all the way through.
B00005JGAB|5.0|The original and the best of the Ramones recordings, and the one to start with for a new fan.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I didn't listen much to this album, although I've owned it for a long time, until only recently after seeing Depeche Mode live in a concert (Playing The Angel) where they played quite a few songs from this album. <br /> <br />This album has a more mature tone. There are more references to love.  In my younger days, I was the drifter type, depressed teen that loved grunge and a little bit of Snoop. But I've grown up, found love and become what many other Gen-Xers have become eventually. <br /> <br />The best songs for me are Goodnight Lovers, Free Love and Dream on.  It's a refreshing album, a nice break from all the other ones, although I love all the other albums too.
B000002UAU|5.0|I refuse to overstate the obvious, or for that matter, go over ground so many others have in reviewing this album. That said, I reserve the right to contradict myself or, at least, think twice about things.  Or maybe, come to no conclusion at all. \\"That is you can't, you know, tune in but it's alright; that is, I think it's not too bad.\\" And to think they didn't include that one?  What makes this whole thing work is John Lennon.  Sure, I know, McCartney thought of the concept and that's all well and good.  But it all works because of Lennon. He has snippets of lyrics that balance out the whole thing. For example he inserts \\"it can't get no worse\\" into the uplifting \\"Getting Better.\\" What he is really doing in the song \\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\" is \\"mourning\\". Struggling to be cool while finding nothing has changed.  When Lennon said \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" was not about drugs he was having fun at your expense.  Now get over it.  He also used genius irony in the song \\"She's Leaving Home.\\" The parents proclaimed \\"Never a thought for ourselves,\\" and with this Lennon conveyed the shallowness and communication gap so prevailent in every generation.  He finally caps it off with the genius \\"A Day in the Life.\\" Death as a comedy. Death as just another absurdity of life.<br /><br />  I remember when I first heard this album.  Very alien to the ear since this production was entirely new at the time.  But it turned out to be a classic and justafiably so.  In fact, it was probably a classic within 24 hours after release - but that is another debate for another time.  There are some dark themes here but, thankfully, they knew how much sugar-coating to include.<br /><br />  Is it the best Beatle album ever made? Hard to say.  Definitely the most technical.  But, I would say that Revolver, Rubber Soul and the White Album are just as excellent - with very different personalities.  O.K. \\"I'm leaving.\\" Now go out and find your own gems of meaning. I can only tell you so much. By the way- look for me- I am on the cover! Then again - was it the butcher picture? Now what would I be doing in a lonely hearts club? Alright - you all know the history! Good-bye.By the way- look for me- I am on the cover! Then again - was it the butcher picture? Now what would I be doing in a lonely hearts club?

0553801503|3.0|I still firmly believe that GRRM is top notch in the fantasy/scifi genre.  In fact, while waiting for Feast to arrive (yawn) I went back and explored his past works (most of which were quite good and showed his talents in other non-fantasy areas of writing, i.e. Fevre and Tuf). <br /> <br />The first three books of this series were tremendous as we all know, and true fans will continue to read them as the years tick by.  But, darn it, this book was not nearly his best and falls into the latter Jordan category of \\"forgettable\\".  I hope GRRM stops resting on his laurels, stops spending too much time between books, stops overthinking the epic he is creating and gets back to doing what he does best.  It will take a massive effort to undo the malaise created in book 4, but I know that HE can pull it off.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|yup another great soundtrack, yeah its a bit repetitive, yeah it sounds a bit like gladiator, but its still a spiffing sound track that is just sooo good when your blasting down the high way with it on full blast! And there's so many soundtracks and films out at the moment, how can there not be bits that sound similar? and I still stand by my point that these so called repetitive bits add a kind of unity to the whole soundtrack rather than being all over the place and disjoint. The only problem with this soundtrack is that the tracks arent really in order which is a bit confusing but its still good ...honest!
B000C1YL1G|4.0|\\"Purple Hills\\"/The radio version of \\"Guilty Conscience\\"/\\"My Band\\"/\\"Forgot About Dre\\"/ and the Ja Rule diss song would've made this a 5 out of 5.
B00005QZWI|5.0|so some people say this soundtrack is too repetitive, but I think that is what ties the whole thing together and makes it so good. There is a theme that runs through the whole film and that gives it a sense of unity, whilst there are other smaller themes such as the music used for the elves and stuff like that gives it a bit more variety, it also means that you can follow the film through in your minds eye, you know which bit has a black rider in it, you know which bit illustrates mordor etc. I think what made me appreciate this soundtrack even more was I was very fortunate to see it performed live in the Royal Albert hall in London, and wow - once you get to hear a full orchestra and choir blast it out, it really makes you realize what an intricate score this is.

B00006V9A0|4.0|this album would be good for say a fan that isnt hardcore about nirvana, but does like the big hits. it would also be good for the die hard fan seeing how the opening trak is unreleased. i'd also like to say Nirvana isnt a punk band they're grunge. if you're a punk you'll still like 'em but whoever said they were punks was wrong. they play grunge  <br /> <br />you know you're right: 7/10 opens the album with a promise but cobains bleak screechy crying vocals take away some of its promise <br /> <br />about a girl: 9/10 great song, a rock song thats not quite as hardcore as some of the other stuff <br /> <br />been a son: 6/10 great intro riff, not exactly my cup of tea though. <br /> <br />sliver: 9/10: about Cobain being left at his grandparents <br /> <br />Smells like teen spirit: 10/10 their big commercial hit, lyric's a bit hard to understand, but it's still great. <br /> <br />come as you are: 10/10 interesting bass line, perfect lyric's <br /> <br />Lithium: 10/10 Nirvana at their best, the chorus line rocks <br /> <br />in bloom: 10/10 another grungy song with a great chorus and solo <br /> <br />heart shaped box: 7/10 not as good as most people make it seem, its still way good.  <br /> <br />penny royal tea: 8/10 another good in utero song, not the best recording of it though. <br /> <br />rape me: 8/10 great way to piss mtv off <br /> <br />dumb: 10/10 softer, but still fabulous the cello really adds something <br /> <br />all apologies: 9/10 another softer one, very good i personally think dumb is better though <br /> <br />man who sold the world: 7/10 cover of david bowie  <br />
044022165X|4.0|Grisham did a wonderful job after he wrote this one. Rainmaker however, is a rare classic case when a young graduate is thrown into the gunlate of law. When young Rudy's first cases is to help a couple sue an insurance corporation for denying claims to help their son whose is suffering from leukemia, he was bearly able to keep up with the top lawyers representing the corporation. He was literly holding the book of all of the medical insurance statutes and laws in hand during a court room session. Rudy then finds a good friend, Deck Shifflet, who quickly becomes Rudy's \\"partner in crime\\". The catch is that Deck hasn't even passed the bar exam. The duo decide that they should at least open a small office to give them selves a working space since they are only freash into the world of lawyers. As the team searches high and low for loop holes in the cororation, time is running out for the young man with leukemia. He dies and then the family is devistated and answers are wanted. In the end, the case is won fair and square by the \\"tag team\\" and the coporation has been agreed by the court to pay a sum of 60 million dollars. But before the corporation could even write that check, they had one last trick up their sleeves and thqt was to declare bankruptcy and close down the corporation before anymore lawsuits were to come knocking at their front door. Rudy and Deck were not to happy but the case recived world reconition for two new lawyers who had taken on a large and strong insurance corporation. Highly reconmend it for those who like drama.
B000BNI90O|5.0|I just picked this up yesterday on the day of its release and after listening to it, I am thoroughly impressed.  I'm glad to see the Lord of the Rings Trilogy receive the same treatment as Star Wars did in the mid-late '90's when they released the complete scores for the original movies. (I just wish they would release Episode II and III) This release really completes the story/movie.  The quality and quantity is amazing, over 3 hours worth of music from start to finish, Howard Shore definetly poured his years of composing experience into this story and it shows.  It's unbelieveable how much great music was left out from the earlier release. <br />Hopefully there isn't such a long wait between releases for The Two Towers and Return of the King. <br /> <br />This is welcome addition to anyones library of film scores. <br />
B000002U9L|4.0|I am a Huge fan of the movie and the soundtrack lacks only a little bit. The songs are great but the goblin voices are different in the soundtrack.

0385507755|1.0|This is an add-on to my original review 14th December. I watched Larry King and read the stuff on the naked gun. It's amazing how inept Larry King and Oprah Winfry were in not asking some of the wonderful questions pozed on Amazon.<br /><br />Please tell me what constructive, usuable piece of information could someone in addiction or in recovery possibly glean from this mass hoax? The overiding issue is - If there are so many untruths then NOTHING is true. I agree with the naysayers and I'm also a recovering addict in a 12 step program. I agree also with the review that depicted Freys work as dangerous.<br /><br />The addiction is always a symptom of underlying issues that is the real problem. While Frey did a step 4 and 5 in the presence of a priest, he's learned nothing from it. Like Frey I've recovered from the insanity but unlike Frey I've worked the remaining steps to treat my character faults.<br /><br />This guy is heavilly into himself, is egocentric and entirely self centered. I believe his work is an opportunist hoax that is larger than life.<br /><br />The real tragedy is that people will avoid 12 step groups thinking that they too can simply tough it out.
B00005NWM3|5.0|From Canada comes the rock sensations Nickelback and their Jesus-lookalike lead vocalist, Chad Kroeger.  Interestingly enough, they got the name for their band from a seemingly useless piece of information: back when Chad was a kid, he would go to the corner store and get a coffee costing $1.45.  He would always pay $1.50 and get a \\"nickel back\\".  When Chad decided to form a band, he decided to name it after a coin, and Nickelback was born.<br /><br />But now for the actual CD.  Nickelback seems to vent about everything that's wrong with the world today, from spouse abuse (\\"Never Again\\") to broken relationships (\\"How You Remind Me\\",among others).  The cool part is, they do it great.  Despite the seemingy prejudiced view against him, Chad has a great voice, and he shows it.<br /><br />Overall, any fan of rock should get this CD.  It really doesn't show you the \\"silver side\\" of life, but what does nowadays?  A great job that I hope will continue in their later CDs.

B000BCKFWK|5.0|It's always a thrill to see a movie get the DVD treatment it deserves, and Frank Miller's Sin City: Recut - Extended - Unrated is a really fantastic package loaded to the gills with all kinds of good stuff.  If you're a Sin City fan, you'll want to just take a day off and indulge yourself in this ultimate Sin City experience - and it will take you the better part of a day to watch and go through everything this little box holds.  Even if you bought the regular DVD when it came out, I really think you'll want to upgrade to this special edition.<br /><br />I was unfamiliar with Frank Miller and his series of Sin City graphic novels.  When I first saw trailers for the film, all I knew was that Jessica Alba was in it, and that was reason enough for me to want to see it.  When you don't know Miller's work, the trailers for the film are hard to get your head around.  You're intrigued by the unique look of the film, with all the dark, gritty backgrounds and the selective use of color in certain scenes, but it isn't easy to figure out what the film is about, exactly.  When you do sit down and watch the film, you're just blown away: the whole look of the film is absolutely mesmerizing, unlike anything you've seen before; the cast is just full of one huge star after another turning in dazzling performances; the stories are dark and haunted and just draw you right in; but it's the characters most of all that captivate you.<br /><br />The film is really four stories assembled into one finished product.  The Customer is Always Right is a short introduction for what is to come - and then Marv takes over.  Marv is one of the most fascinating characters to come along in years.  He's a huge, ugly guy, a thug and killer you can't help but like and respect - and Mickey Rourke is simply amazing in the role.  Marv has the night of his life with a gorgeous woman named Goldie (Jaime King), then wakes up to find her dead.  Framed for the crime, Marv swears to find Goldie's killer, and he lets nothing stand in his way.  Even if it means dying, he's not going to back out - just because Goldie was nice to him.  There's plenty of violent action in this story, and Elijah Wood is surprisingly good as Kevin, an almost superhuman killer who eats his victims.  Then we're off to The Big Fat Kill, where Clive Owen and Benecio Del Toro steal the show, along with Devon Aoki as the beautifully lethal Miho.  She dishes out a lot of graphic violence, including a most excellent beheading.  Alexis Bledel lights up the screen with eyes you could dive right in to.  There's a fair bit of dark comedy in this one, including one incredibly funny bit you won't want to miss.  Finally, there's the story of Hardigan and little Nancy Callahan, a girl that good cop Hardigan saved from a brutal rapist/murderer before having the tables turned completely over on him.  Skinny little Nancy grew up strong and drop-dead gorgeous (like I said, I would buy the movie just for Jessica Alba), but she's still in danger - and only Hardigan can save her from That Yellow Bastard (basically a yellow Ferengi thanks to the damage Hardigan did to him eight years earlier -it's not easy regrowing a set of family jewels, you know - those side effects are brutal).  Bruce Willis is masterful as the tough and gritty yet sensitive Hardigan.<br /><br />It's impossible to truly describe these stories - you just have to see them for yourself.  The performances are so darn good that this movie actually gets better every time you watch it - and this special edition DVD gives you plenty of chances to do just that.  Along with the original theatrical release, you get the uncut version of the movie, split up into four separate, independent chapters; there's some 23 minutes of extra footage - including a couple of scenes that really help embellish the storylines.  You get two commentaries (one with co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, the other with Rodriguez, Quentin Tarentino, and Bruce Willis).  My favorite version features a recording of the Austin premier audience reaction; the depth of the dark comedy in these stories didn't really hit me full force until I was able to join in with that live audience atmosphere.  As if all that isn't enough, though, you also get a series of great featurettes.  Herein is where you truly learn to appreciate the film.  The vast majority of the actual filming was done in front of a green screen, and many of the actors who performed in the same scenes never even met.  And it was all filmed very quickly - all those great backdrops and that unique atmosphere made with CGI.  It's incredible to see just how this movie was shot and put together.<br /><br />There's nothing else out there remotely like Sin City.  It truly makes Frank Miller's comic come to life - for the most part, the movie mirrors the graphic novels themselves almost frame by frame.  Director Robert Rodriguez calls this an anti-movie; in a sense, Miller actually drew his comics in such a way that they could never be filmed.  Rather than adapt the graphic novels to film, Rodriguez went the other way - he adapted the film format to the graphic novels.  When you look at the movie in comparison to the books (and you get a copy of The Hard Goodbye with this DVD package), you'll see exactly what he means.  Sin City is truly an unparalleled, 100% complete success.  I just can't get enough of it..

B0009R1T7M|5.0|I remember when I first heard (of) Sufjan Stevens. Though my first encounter with his music challenged some of my conventions at that point, I was marked and could not let go after I ran into \\"Illinois\\". This, his following installment in his monumental 50 State Project, was even better than its predecessor (\\"Michigan\\") and most of the music released in 2005 you may run into. Hovering around a beautifully poetic musical and lyrical theme, Stevens captures your imagination and takes you on a virtual musical trip through The Prairie State, leaving you wondering whether you were actually there, or it was a trick that he brilliantly played on you without you noticing it.<br /><br />After many, many, many listens, I keep discovering more in this album, and still can't get enough of it. I am in for the long run, until he runs out of states to write albums about.
B00080Z53O|5.0|I was going to skip this movie because of the subject matter, figured it would be too depressing.  Not so!  This movie handled the subject in a much more honest way than the Hollywood blockbuster Million Dollar Baby, which I did not like at all.  (thought it was a cliche-ridden mess.)  Javier Bardem should have received an Oscar, not that Oscars mean that much, but still...he was great.  This is a movie I would watch many times.  I find it honest and emotionally satisfying.  Highly recommended.

0684824906|5.0|This book offers the student of Civil War something much more profound and lasting than the typical history book.  The purpose of reading history is not to merely digest factoids and regurgitate them.  It is to learn the lessons that historical information imparts, to develop an understanding of its significance and impact on society, and to facilitate in identifying with historical figures.  Goodwin is the master of writing historical books that reach these criteria and with extreme readability, without lacking substance.  She did this so well with her Pulitzer Prize winner No Ordinary Time, but, I believe she does it even better with Team of Rivals. I felt like I really got to know Abraham Lincoln.  My respect and love for him grew immensely. The ending, which most of us know, became truly heartbreaking. Of all the books out there on the Civil War, Goodwin brilliantly makes this one unique by focusing primarily on the political genius of Lincoln.  She doesn't portend it to be any more than what it is. But please don't let the term \\"Political\\" scare you away, the more correct term should be \\"Leadership\\". In today's world where true leadership is so desperately needed in all levels of society, this book was a refreshing lesson and reminder of what a great American leader is all about.

0689865384|4.0|I have not read other novels by the author, but I will be after reading this one.  This was an incredibly well written book.  The setting was well created and the characters were believable and well developed.  There are no great leaps of faith that one has to make with some science fiction attempts.  The story line makes sense.  You're wondering how could this all work, and just about when you get to the point were you have to have some type of explanation or you're going to get frustrated, the author gives it to you.  And I liked the explanations and the logic behind how the world got to this point. <br /> <br />Uglies reminds of The Giver, in that the people feel as though they are in a utopia, and the reader thinks this is great to start out with, and then it all starts falling a part at the seams once you begin really thinking about the plot.  I like this book because it raises some of the same questions; how much control should we give the people in power, should you question the world around you, what's with all the rules, conformity, but it does it with the whole idea of receiving cosmetic surgery and hoverboards.  The science and technology added to this story make it easier to swallow then The Giver.
B003MXB4FC|4.0|Have you seen shirts that read, &#34;Vote Pedro&#34; and wondered what they meant? Have you ever walked by a Hot Topic in the last year and seen displays that show a weird looking man with frizzy hair and glasses, and walked away in puzzlement? Then you are in the club of Napoleon uninitiated those whom have not bothered to look into this odd phenomenon known as &#34;Napoleon Dynamite.&#34; Well now is your chance to see what all the hoopla is about!<br /><br />I myself have a sister who works in a Hot Topic, so every time I went in there, I became bombarded by the mass of Napoleon merchandise. Despite this, it never drove me to enough curiosity to rent it and watch it. It looked stupid, it looked pointless, and way over publicized, indeed, it was all these things and much more!<br /><br />Napoleon Dynamite is one of those movies that are so dumb and stupid, yet so good-natured and light-hearted, it is hard to deny it is at least mildly entertaining. I am betting that the personal entertainment value in this movie depends mostly on if you can enjoy &#34;nothing&#34; movies. As this very well may be one of the biggest nothing movies made. That is what makes it so entertaining, because it makes light of High School films in general and family life. It makes all of us, in comparison, look like celebrities in our &#34;normality&#34;.<br /><br />The character Napoleon Dynamite himself is such an oddball, so geeky, so weird, and gawky that anyone else around him looks cool. The great thing about him is that he is so sure that he is cool and so sure that people must like him, just because of who he is. Honestly I do, its hard not to like someone who is so silly, so positive that he is hot, and so totally clueless, he comes across as very sweet and annoying, but endearing.<br /><br />There is not a whole lot of plot going on here, but it works, the whole flow of the movie is relaxed, but it works. The characters just sort of float in and out, they just sort of eek by an existence. At the same time though, these characters are so absurd that you cannot help but wait until they come back on the screen. Characters like Uncle Rico and Kip are absurd, but at the same time, not very far-fetched. Pedro is no doubt one of the favorites, as the clueless and geeky Mexican newcomer who runs for class president, and is Napoleon's only friend.<br /><br />The characters are delightfully nutty, and they make the meet of this film. Napoleon being the crux, with his sleepy-eyed expressions, open-mouth breathing, random saying such as: &#34;Fricking Idiots!&#34;, &#34;Sweet&#34;, and &#34;Get your own Tots.&#34;. If a smirk does not at least form on your lips, there may just be something wrong with you, like maybe you are dead?<br /><br />Hopefully, you're full alive, and you fully enjoy Napoleon Dynamite, or at least enjoy it just a little bit. If not, that's okay, maybe its just not your style, or maybe you need to lighten up.<br /><br />God Bless ~Amystence.

B000B8QEYC|5.0|The Celts was the first Enya song I listened to. I listened to it in a video from my sister's fifteen year old birthday.<br /><br />I got amazed, but I thought there were many people singing together, so it took some time to discover it was this magic person I'm totally and utterly in love with nowadays - ENYA.<br /><br />Orinoco Flow, Storms in Africa, Only Time are some of my favourite songs, from previous albums, but to be honest I love each single song.<br /><br />Amarantine is brilliant! It is introduced with a song in Loxian. This language was taken from the book \\"Water shows the hidden heart\\", by Roma Ryan. The title of this book is also the title of Amarantine's last track. I wonder if the language was created by Roma based in Tolkien books.<br /><br />There is no song in Gaelic, different from the most part of the albums. On the other hand, there is a piece in Japanese.<br /><br />My favourite tracks are Amarantine, It's in the rain, The River Sings, Amid from the falling snow and Water shows the hidden heart.<br /><br />Waiting for Enya's new albums leads to anxiety, but the result is worthwhile. This precious CD is the result of dedication and enchantment, resulting in a perfect melody.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to buying the video. Unfortunatelly Enya DVD was not sold in Brasil.<br /><br />If you want to know more about Enya join ENYA, THE IRISH GODDESS, an Enya community in Orkut.
0671449028|5.0|We borrowed this book from the library, as we do with many books before we buy them.  And this one is probably going to be in our permanent book collection soon.  It is a great bedtime book.  My 14 month old just LOVES it.   <br /> <br />We love all of the Boynton books, and this is no exception.  You can't go wrong with this bedtime story.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Many people consider Shakira a poet. If you are one of those people, I have to say I agree with you. I was never a fan of Shakira. However, my friend asked me to listen to \\"Fijacion Oral vol. 1\\" and I did. I had no clue that this album would become an addiction. And here's why; To begin with, Shakira's music & lyrics on this album indicated two important things to me. One, Shakira is in love and two, maturity. The writing, production and musical arrangements are great. I am a \\"sucker\\" for songs that I can personally get emotionally attached to and this album delivered. If I could choose one song to sum my life at this moment the song would be \\"NO\\".
B000001FOL|5.0|Nico would have to be one of the more underrated punk rocker's of the 70's. Chelsea Girls was Nico's debut album. A lot of people diregard this album because she doesn't write her own songs but it showcases her singing talent beautifully nonetheless. Also the people writing the songs for her were some of the people who knew her best... which is saying something considering the fact that Nico didn't like to open up to anyone.  <br /> <br />In this album you get a taste for her unique, seductive voice. I'd recommend this cd to anyone who's tired of hearing songs that all sound alike because Nico truly is one-of-a-kind.
B000065V1V|5.0|If I would have rated Heathen after the second or third time I listened to it, I probably would have given it between a 3 1/2 and a 4 star rating. But it really grew on me after a while, and now I think it is one of his best. Still don't care too much for the first track, but the rest of the songs more than make up for it! Here's my rating for each one. <br /> <br />1. \\"Sunday\\" ***1/2 out of *****  It's kind of slow and doesn't really go anywhere, but doesen't sound too bad. I like slow songs, but this just isn't one of my favorites. A lot of people would disagree with me though. <br /> <br />2. \\"Cactus\\" ***** out of *****  This is a really good cover song!! <br /> <br />3. \\"Slip Away\\" ****1/2  The lyrics are very cheesy. \\"Twinkle, Twinkle, Uncle Floyd?!\\" I think Bowie wrote this song about a guy who did a tv talk show for kids, that passed away, but I'm not sure. The music is excellent and makes up for the cheesy lyrics. <br /> <br />4. \\"Slow Burn\\" *****  This seems to be a lot of fans' favorite. I can see why! <br /> <br />5. \\"Afraid\\" *****  This seems to be a lot of fans' least favorite. WTF?! I love this one. It's just an up beat fun song! <br /> <br />6. \\"I've Been Waiting For You\\" ****1/2  Didn't use to care too much for this one, but it really grew on me. This is a Neil Young cover. <br /> <br />7. \\"I Would Be Your Slave\\" *****  May be my second favorite off the CD.  Great music and lyrics. <br /> <br />8. \\"I Took A Trip On A Gemini Spaceship\\" *****  A fast and fun song. <br /> <br />9. \\"5:15 The Angels Have Gone\\"  *****  Another one that really grew on me. It's slow, but a lot better than \\"Sunday.\\" An excellent track! <br /> <br />10. \\"Everyone Says 'Hi'\\" ******  My personal favorite. This one can almost bring tears to your eyes, it's that good! <br /> <br />11. \\"A Better Future\\" ****1/2  Lyrics are a little cheesy, but sincere. Another one that grew on me. <br /> <br />12. \\"Heathen (The Rays) *****  This one reeaaallllyy grew on me!! Tied with \\"I Would Be Your Slave,\\" for second favorite. A great way to end the CD. <br /> <br />Anyway, that's just my opinion. Some people don't like it as well a Bowie's others, but they probably didn't listen to it enough times. If you let it grow on you, it can become a favorite and extremely addicting. Definitely recommended!!!!
0930289234|5.0|There are only a few comic books that I re-read on a regular basis; Yummy Fur, The Dark Knight Returns, Cerebus and this one, Watchman.<br /><br />It isn't just the richly drawn characters, a whirligig of a plot or the amazing attention to detail that went into the creation of this graphic novel; it's the fact that I find my loyalties shifting from character to character depending on my mood that keeps me coming back.<br /><br />Every single major character in this book has a reason for being, a motivation beyond fulfilling their role in a plot. It is very easy to imagine their lives before, and for those who survive, after the book. Even secondary characters, like Hollis, the original Owl, have a wholly realized back-story that makes you realize his loss all the more.<br /><br />There are few comic books that deserve to be called \\"literature\\". Watchman is one of them.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I am now at an age where being a fan is rather frowned upon I think but, I realize that I have 5 Madonna CDs that I listen to over and over and now, after listening to Confessions, I genuinely can't wait to see what she does next. She is a true icon and a wonderful role model for us women in our 40s. She's vibrant, beautiful, and I admit with some chagrin, perhaps the most intelligent and talented woman of my generation. I remember seeing her on \\"American Bandstand\\" saying she wanted to rule the world. I believe she may have accomplished this. Anyway, her latest CD is wonderful. Every song is great and all the generations of my family enjoy it and we all listen to it together and dance to it together. YOU GO GIRL! Love it.
B000BMSTMS|1.0|Here's a quick run down for you <br /> <br />1) Many people, including ex-korn member Head - Aswell as people who work for the record label, have said that on this album - Korn ran out of ideas & had to resort to asking the label for PROFESSIONAL PAID SONG WRITERS... basically the same people hired to write songs for avril lavigne, nsync, etc...same people <br /> <br />2) So what you are hearing is *not* a Korn album - You're hearing a band thats lost all creativity who is playing songs written by other people - That's it. It's not Korn, its professional song writers trying to write Korn songs. <br /> <br />3) Its pathetic & sad & this band has absolutely no credibility. <br /> <br />Disagreeing with this review doesn't matter to me & won't change the fact that Korn are using the Matrix songwriting team, the exact same team Avril Lavigne uses.. Don't believe me? look it up <br /> <br />losers.

B0000A02TZ|5.0|All college movies begin and end with a little film called National Lampoon's Animal House. A foray into movies for the first time for National Lampoon, having succeeded on radio and as a magazine, this raucous classic has everything you'd want in a comedy: memorable characters & quotes, partying, a great soundtrack, and a group of unknowns that became stars overnight.<br /><br /> The basic plot: freshmen Kent Dorfman (Stephen Furst) and Larry Kroger (Tom Hulce) are rejected from the preppy Omega fraternity and head to the Delta house, where Kent's older brother Fred went. Delta turns out to be the party frat, aka 'animal house,' at Faber College, and Dean Wormer (John Vernon) wants them shut down and puts them on double secret probation. But Delta won't die, so one toga party, road trip, horse killing, food fight, and parade destruction later, the Deltas beat the rules.<br /><br /> Saying Animal House always brings to mind John Belushi as Bluto Blutarsky, the 7-year Delta member whose grade point average is 0.0 and who gives fine advice like, \\"Start drinking heavily.\\" Bluto is the best character hands down, and his speech to get the Deltas back up when they're down is classic, yelling, \\"Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!\\"<br /><br /> So if you haven't see Animal House, you basically haven't lived. See it now, then watch it again. GATOR!

0876855575|2.0|Charles Bukowski is a writer.  He's not the type to go to writers clubs, instead he drank, as most good writers do - and a lot of bad ones I suppose.  He's dead now, so it's ok to like him.<br /><br />I was making my way through the lot of his novels - his Novels because I hate poetry -  `Postal Service' is his best so far.<br /><br />What negated `Ham on Rye' in my opinion was his EMPHASIS on just how hard his life was as a child growing up in a loveless household.<br /><br />Bukowski is a person who values the idea of individualism.  It is hard for me to fully respect a man who calls himself an individual and a `tough guy,' who so obviously blames his parents for his attitude towards the world.<br /><br />Directly after this book I read Celine's `Death on the Installment Plan,' an author recommended by Bukowski as being one of his consistent favorites.  I can understand that, because Celine's childhood was much the same; poor, loveless, solitary - in short a joy to read.<br /><br />Of course `Ham on Rye' is well written, you get a very strong sense of voice and tone from all of his books.  He's one of the few authors that are fun to read aloud to yourself because there's a definite beat and rhythm to his narrative process.<br /><br />Not a bad book, on the grand scheme, but it showed me a side of this man who lived a `hard' life, who takes the easy way out and blames his childhood for being the character that he is.
B0000028M7|5.0|Alice in Chains achieved immortality with this timeless rocker.  Guitarist Jerry Cantrell tuned-down as a homage to such metal stalwarts as Black Sabbath and his harmonies with vocalist Layne Staley make this album highly-listenable.  Whether taking self-loathing and stark nihilism to new heights, or depths, as it were, with such classics as the title track, and \\"Down in a Hole,\\" or the iconoclastic \\"Them Bones,\\" or issuing cautionary tales about heroin with \\"Junkhead\\" and \\"Godsmack,\\" this CD is worth the cash.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|I liked the movie--not sure why.  I thought Drew Barrymore once again proved herself third-rate as an actress.  But she is nothing to the movie, so I'll forgive it.  If you want to see a movie that excels at psychological obscurity/clarity, rent or buy Jacob's ladder--and PAY ATTENTION!  That movie  will blow you away if you give it a chance.   Obviously, I know there are huge differences between the two films, but they're not apples and oranges.  Jacob's Ladder has affected many directors and writers, and you will see what I mean once you watch it--it is as underrated as Donnie is overrated.  You'll thank me--promise!

B000002BBY|2.0|It's funny. The British have invented tons of rock subgenres, and spawned some of the best bands ever, but they've also produced some of the most derivative and pointless ones.<br /><br />Oasis falls into the second category. They're the epitome of everything bad about British music and the British music press. Mid 90's Britpop will never be known for it's originality, but Oasis takes the cake. Most of the music on here is basically carbon copy British Invasion rock with T-Rex and Pixies-style distortion added, so that they can pass it off as alternative rock. Gallagher's voice sounds a little too Beatles-esque for it's own good. Even professionals such as the All Music Guide will profess that many of Oasis' melodies and lyrics are directly ripped off of bands that have done them far better.<br /><br />And let's not forget the hype. Dear God. Has there ever been a more overhyped band in history? 10 years ago, \\"What's The Story, Morning Glory?\\", along with Oasis' previous album \\"Definitely Maybe\\" were treated like like Godsends by our good friends at NME, which will give a glowing review to any band, given they are part of whatever genre is being pushed at the moment. Seems the success went to their already over-inflated heads, and they started proclaiming themselves the biggest band in the world (which they still do). They even went as far as to attack the late, great George Harrison.<br /><br />2 stars for \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\" and \\"Wonderwall\\", which are both guilty pleasures. Other than that, get some British rock that doesn't have a massive debt towards a dozen other bands before it.
B000AP04EW|1.0|This is a horrible movie. Don't waste your money to even rent it. I watched until within about 10-15 minutes of the end, when I finally just couldn't take it anymore and had to turn it off. It is pretty darn bad when I of all people turn a movie off, especially one I was looking forward to seeing. I am puzzled as to why an actor and actress of Angelina & Brad's status and talent would even take on such a stupid, predictable and unrealistic flick.  <br /> <br />Angelina Jolie portrays a sickeningly perfect working wife who juggles her high profile job as a vixen mercernary (which she lies to her husband about, as he does her) and keeps a sickeningly perfect house and puts stiff, formal 5-star resturaunt meals on the table for her husband every night, complete with the mundane, meaningless conversation of two sexpot acquaintances with their oh-so-perfect life gone wrong. Think \\"American Beauty\\" marriage with passion and sex and lies about things as important as what the couple does for a living.  <br /> <br />Then there is the supposedly hot \\"make up sex\\" scene between Pitt and Jolie at the end where their whole multi-million dollar mansion along with the very expensive furnishings and pricey green drapes is blown up to smithereens, and all they can think of is getting it on, tacky pick up lines and all. All as a result of their stupid coincidental misunderstanding and mistrust of one another. When they are tearing each other's clothes off after days of trying to kill each other and destroying their magnificent home as a result is just too much for me. This is the point where the television gets switched to \\"off\\". <br /> <br />I am not a picky movie person, but this was a waste of the $5 I spent on the movie rental for it. <br /> <br />The bottom line? This is a stupid, predictable, unrealistic movie in extremely bad taste with a mediocre script and famous actors. Extremely overrated, with lesser known actors and without Brangelina's whirlwind romance as a publicity boost, it would never even have made it into the theatres, or if it had it would have, shall we say, bombed?
B0000CDLA7|5.0|the review down was really helpful.,though i don't agree with some of the reviews...the latest was accurate,though i really thought petrucci would add a little bit of old school dreamtheater.His riffs seem robotic and without life.I liked myung,how his bass starts in \\"as i am\\" with the harmonics.It tells people how bass can be versatile.Rudess gave a little bit of flavor in TOT especially in \\"in the name of god\\". Overall, i liked the content of TOT. A classic album which i'll listen to while headbanging.keep it up DT!

B00004VVNB|5.0|When this movie first opened years ago, I was so blown away that I went to see it again the following night. Although it is somewhat dated, LOGAN'S RUN still has that impressive quality for today's audience. (Add another point if you think Michael York is hot!) Most definitely worth purchasing.
B00008YJH5|5.0|Listening to the album you can definitely hear how influential it was to soo many albums.  but, people. come on , their name is Pixies, no The.  I feel like going crazy every time I read/hear people refer to them as The Pixies.  come on.

B000ASDFJU|1.0|well i bought the bookset.. <br />AND to my surprise the slots they made to insert the DVDS in <br />some of them are too tight for the DVDS to the extent that some of the DVDs were kind of marked & slightly scratched out of the tight DVD insert space in the booklet.. <br /> <br />such a dissappointment for such a beautiful package.. <br /> <br />it would have been better if the DVDS could have been kept in a better way.
B000002UAX|4.0|In 1968 The Beatles released what is concidered by many to be their, as well as the greatest album of all time. Well is this true, well not exactly. See while its a fine album its clearly not their best. Most of all the songs are good with an exception of a slight few. The songwriting is good on the serious songs, and the musicianship is good as well. Unlike other Beatles albums where every single became a hit none of the songs on this album became really big hits actually. The songs that were released did become minor hits, and did become classics and radio staples but they didnt hit the charts as hard. Though some of the songs are some of the bands all time best, some of them are just, well... not so memorable.<br /><br />While I can kind of see where some people would concider this the bands best because of songs like 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' and 'Blackbird' and 'Glass Onion' other songs are just incredably out of place. 'Bungalow Bill' 'Revolution 9' have absolutly no place on this or any other album. They are not hidden art or anything just contrived noise.<br /><br />The band is sepperated, John wrote all his songs alone, as did George, Paul, and Ringo. You can here the poppy side in Paul's songs. The real lyracism in John's music. The real musical prowes in George's music, and what ever it is you would call Ringo's stuff. Their was very little if any teamwork on this album and it shows. John and George's music is clearly better and stronger, while Pauls was more accesable and radio friendly.<br /><br />Songs like 'Helter Skelter' 'While My Guitar' 'U.S.S.R.' 'Birthday' all became classics like I said. Other songs like 'Blackbird' 'Yur Blues' and 'Heppnies Is A Warm Gun' are all very good songs and are the main reason why this album is a classic. Its not the songs everyone knows that make this a classic its the hidden gems in the fabric of the album by John Lennon. And I know it sounds like Im praising him a lot but its for a good reason the man was a genius and I truly feel that he was the strength of the band and this album really shows it.<br /><br />So to wrap things up this is a good album, a little uneven in places but what album isnt. The good outweighs the bad by a ton and for any music fan not to own this album is absolutly crazy to me.s a genius and I truly feel that he was the strength of the band and this album really shows it. <br /> <br />So to wrap things up this is a good album, a little uneven in places but what album isnt.

B000ASATWQ|4.0|I'm a Jamaican mother of 3 children in her thirties who went to college during hip hop's 'Tribe Called Quest' days.  I finally found an album that mixes my love and respect for reggae and 'positive' hip-hop.  And I can enjoy it around my kids since there's no cussing.   <br /> <br />I listen to the CD 4-5/week.  Title track, For The Babies, Road to Zion and Khaki Suit are my favorites.  Enjoy!
0553573403|5.0|I began reading A Game of Thrones as part of a slew of book-reading to be done during Cross-Country indoor training due to an injury.  I am most glad that I took the time to pick this book up off my shelf (where it had been sitting, unread for a while).  I found myself partaking in an engrossing story which enticed me to read each day when I went to the gym.<br /><br />Primarily, the story is driven by intrigue and the sensation of never knowing what is truly going on in the story.  This gives the novel a feeling of ominous dread throughout with high points of personal victory.  The intrigue is generated primarily through the author's truly crafted characters.  As another reviewer mentions, there are no archetypes in this book.  I think that is a credit to the work of George R.R. Martin.  The world is not made of archetypes.  At most, people strive to become archetypal.  However, each day is a story of the slips and falls from that striving and how each person recovers in his/her quest to reach that desired archetype of self.  It is exciting to see characters who struggle as all of us do but in a different setting.  It is enlightening to the reader, offering reflection on the situations, instead of just presenting a story-book facade of medieval-fantasy intrigue. His characters drive the story through their interactions.  There is always an element of suspense involved as events unfold, for each character is real, corruptible when good and redeemable when seemingly evil.<br /><br />The only overall weakness in the story is the fact that the religion is presented as some-what important but thoroughly underdeveloped.  However, since this is not of prime importance to the narrative, I find it impossible to justify slighting Martin for this.<br /><br />Therefore, I suggest this novel to the following categories of readers:<br /><br />1) Fantasy / Science Fiction Readers<br /><br />2) Readers of Drama<br /><br />3) Readers of Political Drama<br /><br />4) Readers with any interest in a novel filled with intrigue.a novel filled with intrigue.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Well, I saw 'King Kong' tonight and it was brilliant.  From the start the audience is kind of rushed into the roaring twenties with depictions of every stereotype one can imagine from that fascinating and influential era.  Everything from the tolerance movement smashing booze bottles in the street, construction workers walking steel beams high atop sky scrapers to poor immigrants in New York City living in shanty towns scrounging for any morsel of food, no stone was left unturned in this aspect.<br /><br />These are desperate times indeed and Peter Jackson the director makes sure that the viewers are fully conscious of this, which helps set up future plot elements of the film.  Shortly after this, the audience is introduced to Ann Darrow, brought to life by in an extraordinary yet subtle performance by the enchanting actress Naomi Watts.  Ann Darrow is throwing a Vaudevillesque show on Broadway in New York, stunning the patrons with fantastic feats of showmanship such as juggling, dancing, singing and most importantly a passion for her work.  As most of her peers and fellow New Yorkers, despite her talent and love of the show, she's not getting paid and it's not easy to perform on an empty stomach.  She receives some comfort from a fellow thespian, an older gentleman, who appears as somewhat of a mentor and provider of moral support.  Merrily they go off to dinner, but their happiness is short lived.  The very next day they are informed that they've been laid off, and their paychecks are as empty as their pockets.  Grumbling and dissatisfaction aside, they quickly accept their downtrodden status and go about their lives, except for Ann who refuses to entirely give up her dreams.  She pursues a few dead end roads, but it won't be long before she gets more than she bargained for.<br /><br />In the mean time the film introduces Jack Black's excellent portrayal of Carl Denham, moving pictures director-extraordinaire, who is struggling with convincing Hollywood big shots of the merit of his animal footage depicting monkeys picking lice off each other.  Perhaps needless to say, the producers are less than impressed with Denham's presentation and so a defensive backlash ensues against the funders of his endeavors.  It doesn't go all too well, and so Carl and his assistant Preston, effectively portrayed by his former 'Orange County' co-star Colin Hanks, aka Tom Hanks' son, rush out of the building with all their movie reels and hastily plan what sounds like a ludicrous scheme to save whatever remains of their seemingly ill-fated movie dream.<br /><br />Things are not as bad as they might seem, however, as Carl goes on his search for a fair maiden to portray the damsel in distress that he has in mind for his fantastical film which at this point is not much more than a twinkle in his crazy eyes.  At first his search is fruitless, but before his feeling of futility sets in, he lays his wild-eyed gaze upon an angel of no lesser description, a beauty that illuminates her surroundings.  His eyes are fixed and her aura captures his imagination, and he knows he has found the perfect woman for the part he has in mind for the biggest project of his life.  He introduces himself in a charming way that only Jack Black can pull off, and invites her to a dinner, something which she would like to but simply cannot refuse.  Luckily for Carl Denham she's starving, and so he convinces her, reluctantly, to join his voyage of uncertainty that's full of promise.  The clincher for Ann is to work with a screen writer by the name of Jack Driscoll, who she happens to be a big admirer of.<br /><br />What follows is a maddening journey that is foreshadowed by Ann's light step onto the boarding plank and her gentle touch of the bannister of the ship by the name of 'Venturer'.  There are a couple of other foreshadowing elements as well that hint of impending doom, such as one of the shipmates reading the classic novel entitled 'Heart of Darkness'.  Aboard the shipwhich Carl had essentially conned its captain into lending for his services, we meet another unfortunate soul who was fooled by the conniving Carl, and he is none other than the famous playwright Jack Driscoll.  Without giving too much away, there's a romance that develops which continues throughout the film, along with some minor character development until they reach the island which Carl believes has all the answers to his woes.  Carl basically shanghaied this ship so he could take his film crew and cast to an infamous, uncharted destination by the ominous name of 'Skull Island', which is another foreboding element of disasters to come.<br /><br />Upon the arrival on the island after narrowly escaping a harrowing battle against the islands cliffs and the ocean's surf, the crew of the 'Venturer' quickly learn that there is nothing ordinary about this island, something most of them already suspected throughout their journey across the sea.  The trials suffered by all on this remote and most hopeless of places are exhausting, not only by them but by the film's audience.  Event after event, the pace is unrelenting, adreline rush inducing, only slowing down long enough to give the audience pause to catch their breath.<br /><br />It's safe to assume at this point that everyone knows by the trailers that the special effects are truly stunning, well after watching the 3 hour movie it's even more amazing than most are led to believe by the short clips provided by the teasers.  King Kong himself is as believable as any of the real life cast members.  While the cast is magnificent, like Adrien Brody who does a convincing job as a geeky yet brave playwright/screenwriter, King Kong elicits a great deal of emotion but at the same time he commands respect with an awe-inspiring presence.  The interaction between him and Ann Darrow have moments of magic and brilliance, such tenderness to melt even the most hardened of hearts, not to mention enough action and fighting to excite the most jaded of movie goers.<br /><br />If there is one word that can sum up this film it would be passion.  There's passion abound in this film, off and on screen.  Peter Jackson clearly delivered a labor of love with 'King Kong', pouring his heart and soul into it.  Jack Black portrayed Carl Denham with a zealousness that made a believer out of me.  Carl became a real, greedy, seedy, yet in an ironic way a likeable film maker whose lofty goal of making the greatest film ever eventually led to his obsession that would manifest itself in success at no matter what cost to human life or other sacrifice.  Naomi Watts, where to begin.  She gave a very understated yet poignant performance as Ann Darrow, the demure, unassuming, starry-eyed beauty that captivated the heart of a beast.  Her performance was very giving, and really helped to bring to life King Kong.  King Kong himself is an artistic achievement the likes which have never been seen before.  He moves, breathes, feels, falls, bleeds and suffers just as much as the rest of us, yet he's just made of digital bits of 0's and 1's.  If the special effects team doesn't win an Oscar for this film, I will be shocked.  Much like Jackson's LOTR trilogy, there was an obvious passion on the part of the entire film crew, everything from the massive, elaborate sets, a living, breathing environment from the roaring twenties to an island of doom to the blitz of New York City's broadway.  I can't forget the score which richly complimented the moving movements of compassion, sorrow, heroism and comradery.  All around and in between there was deep felt passion in this film.<br /><br />If it hasn't been covered enough, the character development is well conceived, and I'm glad that Jackson took the time to flesh out the characters, not to mention build up the story to the climax that makes the film oh so satisfying.  This movie has it all.  This IS why I go to the movies, period.  It has literally something for everyone, and for those with patience this movie has plenty to offer, because at 3 hours it might be a little too long for some, but it is well worth the down time.<br /><br />One last thing to add about the film, the irony behind the story of King Kong and humanity is worthy for food for thought.  King Kong is a beast, but his humanity far surpasses that of most of the people depicted in the film.  Ann's outer beauty is matched by her inner beauty, and that is something which resonates within Kong's gargantuan heart.  Hopefully it will make people think about that for a moment, how such a living paradox in the form of a giant gorilla can have so much meaning that goes beyond the silver screen.<br /><br />I was genuinely moved several times during this film, and I don't say that about very many films, not at all.  Without a doubt this is the best movie that I've seen this year.  You owe it to yourself to see this film if you're just a fan of movies in general, I can almost guarantee you will not be disappointed.  I'm sure I missed something in my review, but I don't want to spoil too much of it, although hopefully I provided enough info for people to judge whether they want to see it or not.word that can sum up this film it would be passion.

6305537321|5.0|Where Roman Holiday was Audrey Hepburn as a girl on the verge womanhood, in Breakfast at Tiffany's Audrey is full grown. <br /> <br />Breakfast at Tiffany's has become what Truman Capote is most synonymous for.  The centers around Holly Golightly.  Holly lives off the goodness of older men.  Or as she puts it, off the money they give her for tips.  (I am sure in the book she did more than that but in the movie, she never sleeps with the men.) <br /> <br />Into her life comes Paul (George Peppard), a would be writer.  He has his first book published but not it was not a great success.  He is writing his follow-up with the support of his female benefactor (Patricia Neal) (who he does sleep with). <br /> <br />Paul becomes entranced with Holly and the become fast friends.  Holly's life becomes complicated, first by the arrival of her first husband (Buddy Ebsen) and then a scandal involving a prisoner she visits and brings back \\"weather reports\\" from, Sally Tomato.  Paul discovers that his feelings for her are more than friends. <br /> <br />The other two principal featured characters are her harried upstairs Japanese neighbor (Mickey Rooney - yes that's right) and Cat, a stray cat she takes care of. <br /> <br />The other star of the film is \\"Moon River\\" the Oscar winning song by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer. <br /> <br />This film was the first breakaway hit for Blake Edwards and became his signature film. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: None <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I love Madonna.  And she outdid herself once again.  Each album she makes has a sense all its own, and this one goes along with that.  It is definitely fun, and the fact that you can dance to it all the way through makes it even better. <br /> <br />To all you Madonna haters, you are the ones with no taste in music.  I enjoy all types of music, alternative, pop, rock, hard rock, reggae, ska, classical, jazz, blues, r&b, hip hop, world, latin, showtunes, and this includes Madonna.  Although her lyrics may not be the most sophisticated when it comes to pop (that description would go to the likes of Tori, Fiona, and Nelly Furtado, among many others), they are fun, and there is nothing wrong with that.  Similarly, Madonna's voice may not be the best in the business, but she can still carry a tune and sing on key.  People who enjoy her music aren't looking for powerhouse vocals, they are looking for something that is fun.   <br /> <br />What truly makes Madonna an artist is her ability to reinvent herself, to come up with hits for over twenty years, to have fun with music and her image, to make incredible videos, to put together amazing tours and performances (to which I certainly hope I can finally go to next year), and to be true to herself.  She does not take crap from anyone.  She is not phased by bad reviews and she does what makes her happy and fulfilled, be it acting, writing childrens books, and so forth. <br /> <br />And although she is 47, she looks AMAZING.  So, if you are the ones criticizing her looks and her age, you probably wouldn't know the difference between a downward dog and a golden retriever.  She is extremely fit and very beautiful.  <br /> <br />You probably haven't heard the rest of this album beyond \\"Hung Up\\" (one of the most fun songs on the album, although my favorite is \\"Isaac\\").  And yes, she does sample songs from the past, but she is definitely not the first person to do this.  Ditty, Eminem, Janet Jackson, and may others have done this too, some legally, others no so legally.  And that doesn't even begin to cover the number of people who have done decent cover versions of songs (let alone terrible versions). <br /> <br />So, if you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything.  If you are a fan of great Pop and Dance music, definitely buy this album.  If you want to dance, even when listening to this album in your car, buy this album.  If you want to have fun, buy this album.  It won't disappoint. <br /> <br />MADONNA, KEEP THE GREAT MUSIC COMING!!! WE LOVE YOU!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|Okay, to straighten things out, I am not a Tool Fanboy. This is the only tool album I own as of yet, and when I say that this goes in my top ten, it is coming from an ameteur musician with wide ranging music tastes. To put it bluntly, this is probably the best music purchase that many of you will ever find. No matter what level of musical appreciation you have, you will love this album. This album might take a few listens for anyone to begin to assimilate. What is it with this album? It is like Dark Side of the Moon, it is utterably accessible and convincing at the surface, yet eternally deep. I am not saying that if you like The Dark Side of the Moon you will like this, I am saying that they are loved and revered for the same reason.    Before I go on, I want to address some criticisms. College music major has some valid points. This album is repetitive as hell, especially with the riffage. This is called drone rock, or drone metal, and serves a purpose. Through repetition of a motif, the song aquires an identity. Other related riffs permeate the songs, as well as subtle changes. The song builds up on the premise of the motif until it reaches a spectacular climax that would be impossible with tons of riffs and such. As for calling it nu-metal riffage, that is bull. I will admit that many nu-metal bands imitate the style, but that doesn't make it nu-metal. That would be like calling metallica death metal. As for maynard, who cares what chord you sing under? A note is a note, it is just as hard to sing in any chord/key. Maynard is an amazing singer, he has a ton of control and a great tone. He is also varied, going from yells and such grudge and ticks and leechesish stuff to songs like parabol or reflection. Now, for king crimson and dream theatre, one of them is the all time greatest progressive band of all time and the most innovative rock group I've ever heard, and one of them is a poser band that gets by by pretending to be uber technical. One of them is worthy of comparison.     Back to the pros (there are no cons) of this album. First off, it is utterly seamless, there isn't a note that doesn't belong. The drummer, danny carry, is absolutly amazing. This album is widely reagarded as one of the greatest rock drum performances ever. That's reason enough to buy this album. Another reason is that this will make you realize just how unoriginal all of this nu-metal crud on the radio is.     For this last paragraph, I want to delve into some of the things that will keep you hooked for months on this album. As some reviewer mentioned, on the title track, Maynard sings in fibonacci sequence, and the drummer drums in fibbonacci sequence, which fits the theme of the song. The lyrics \\"spiral out\\" are backed by a fibbonacci spiral in the rythem section. Also, this is a hint for a concept called \\"the holy gift\\". Basically, the tracks can be rearranged to fit a new pattern, where all of the songs transist into one another in creative ways (they already transist a lot in the regular way, so to pull this off, it either has to have an ambiguous ending or a subtle sub-transition. For example, ticks and leeches goes into mantra, and mantra sounds like dry heaves, it is actually a slowed down siamese cat being squeezed sound, which fits \\"I hope you choke\\"). The order is 6,7,5,8,4,9,13,1,12,2,11,3,10. Try it when you are ready to understand it, after you know the album well. It will breathe new life into it.
0780628551|4.0|Why everyone say that's a bad movie? Because it is?... One movie, in this case, a Sci Fi movie, must'nt have a lot of special effect's to be good. I think the story, and the way she's told, are very good on this The Astronaut's Wife. The idea of an extraterrestrial inteligence moving across the space, trying to find a body to survive it's very original, on my opinion. The story it's not obvious, and perhaps that's because the most part of the people dont like that. <br /> <br />Not interesting? Because it's not like de Star Wars?... Baaaaaa
B00005BKZJ|5.0|Marianne Sagebrecht made a brilliant movie debut in the German film \\"Zuckerbaby (Sugarbaby)\\" (please release this soon on DVD).  Bagdad Caf is her American film debut.  The creative team is also from \\"Sugarbaby\\", Percy and Eleonore Adlon). <br /> <br />Jasmine (Sagebrecht) and her husband are on a cross country trip.  They are at a rest stop in the Mohave desert when they have a fight.  Jasmine takes the suitcase from the trunk and walks off.  Jasmine hitches a ride and which stops at the Bagdad Caf and Motel. <br /> <br />Brenda (CCH Pounder), the hotel owner/manager, doesn't know what to make out of Jasmine. But Jasmine has the money, so Brenda rents her one of the rooms.  Everyone gets along with Jamine's easy going nature, except Brenda.  Eventually, even Brenda succumbs to Jasmine's charm. <br /> <br />This is a film about tolerance.  Everyone in this film has intolerance and finds that the person beneath is more important. <br /> <br />Sagebrecht gives another brilliant performance.  Her character grows during the course of the film. <br /> <br />CCH Pounder is the one of those great actresses that never gets the attention that she deserves.  She gives Brenda many layers.  Brenda's life has been far from easy and therefore, she is suspicious of everyone.  Therefore, it takes a great actress to convincingly change from suspicious to accepting of Jasmine. <br /> <br />This is the best of independent film making.   <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: None <br />
B000005RQT|5.0|I would consider this the best Deep Purple album to date.  Machine Head is somewhat overrated (yeah highway star, Smoke, lazy, Space truckin).  This album is very underrated.  The remixed tracks are very good.

B00004Z400|5.0|The first Deftones song I ever heard was Hexagram of the self title. I remember when I first heard those melodic, brutal notes I knew I was going to fall in love with this band. I loved 2003's \\"Deftones\\", but I knew all the rage for Deftones was \\"White Pony\\". I had to get it. I finally bought it almost 5 years late, but never too late right? Anyway, I gave it a spin, I almost cried. The second \\"Fieticaria\\" broke in, I loved it, and the rest as they came. \\"Digital Bath\\", I almost died. \\"Elite\\", heviest Deftones song EVER! \\"RX Queen\\", dark, amazing. \\"Street Carp\\", riffy, heavy and catchy. \\"Teenager\\", calm, beautiful. \\"Knife Prty\\", no other song can touch it. \\"Korea\\", brutal, catchy. \\"Passenger, incerdible, Now way! Keenan comes in on this one!! \\"Change(In the house of flies), the single, and a great one at that! \\"Pink Maggit\\", dark, creepy. Perfect way to close this amazing album. This was the first time that every song on the album had no complaints. I love this CD. I listen to it all the time. I cant stop listening to it! And to that kid who wrote, \\"Its the singer\\", I think you need to shut up! The singers name is Chino, aka, the best there is. Oh, cant take a little creativity with a guys voice? And cant take it when a guy doesnt sing about breaking up with his girlfriend and starts singing poetry? Sorry dude but never diss Chino. Or Deftones. Its not Nu-Metal!! And its not Korn!! Everyone- stop comparing them to Korn. Everyone of there albums is awesome, even Adrenaline, but White Pony is untouchable. Do yourself a favor and buy this album!!! Im also upset about how everyone is hatin on the self title. What the heck? Of course its not White Pony! Nothing is. \\"Deftones\\" is a fine album. But again, White Pony is the \\"god\\" of metal albums. I'd say Deftones are the best metal act to walk the planet. Ugh,I keep calling them Metal. There not! They're nothing anyone has ever heard!! Oh man, JUST BUY THIS ALBUM!!! And prepare to be amazed.
B0007TKNKG|5.0|This movie is definently \\"Over the Top\\"! I know it isn't meant to be a comedy but come on!! If you take this movie seriously I promise you will be dissapointed. Add it to your collection now for years and years of nonstop drunken laughter.
B0006L16N8|1.0|As you probably guessed from the review title, i'm not eaxctly Coldplay's biggest fan, in fact I find them mind numbingly boring.  Coldplay have a lot to answer for, not only do they clog the airwaves in England, but they also appear to have spawned numerous similar dull English bands (Keane, Athlete etc..).  All their songs are pretty much the same, I mean if you had the album on repeat, you'd barely know when one track ends and the next starts.<br /><br />Along with the likes of Keane they somehow manage to shift multi platinum albums of boring rubbish.  In England it's like everyone who is just your average music fan, likes them and buys their mediocre albums.  That is all Coldplay are, an average, uninspiring band for average normal people, who happily pass away their time listening to this dross.  As I mentioned earlier though, I blame them most for seemingly being the first in a long string of awful dull bands that followed.<br /><br />Mediocre in every way.
0440418569|5.0|This review is focused soley on the religious aspects of the book.  Many people who have written reviews are very dissapointed in Pullman's portrayal of the church and also, his lack of the mention of Christ in any way shape or form.  One such review stated that the mention of Christ would negate his views completely, which i find false.  Pullman is not taking a stab at christianity, in fact, Pullman does not actually reveal his bias towards the christian religion at any point.  what he is attempting to do is make a stabbing critizicm of organized religion.  the powers of the church attempting to kill lyra and the actions of the regent and the authority are based on political motives, not the motivations of benevolent intentions or acts of good faith.  pullman is thus criticizing the way in which the upper echelons of the catholic church operate primarily on politics.  pullman has no qualms with the average priest in your friendly neighborhood catholic church, or if he does, he doesnt show it, doing so would wreck his argument against organized religion.  also, he does not bring christ in because he most likely does not have objection to the goodness of christ.the combination of all these factors makes this book, while also incredibly gripping and heart-wrenching (one of only 2 books that have ever made me cry) primarily an excellent criticism of organized religion and the politics of the catholic church
1591840562|5.0|Somewhere in the beginning of the book, Guy suggests ... this book is meant for people who \\"want to change the world\\". This mantra is repeated indirectly throughout the book. Being an Apple fellow and on the early Mac team, Guy has seen how some junkie looking teenagers transformed the world of computing. His experience and vision is reflected in every chapter of this book.  The book has a wonderful easy to read format. From the first chapter, Guy starts talking about simple practical things. I often use it as a reality check on my business plans and thoughts. It was a great relief when Guy talks about the importance of \\"execution\\" rather than \\"planning and forecast\\" for startups.   The book has no parallel in the market for a new entrepreneur - who has an idea, knows that \\"it makes sense for the end user\\", doesn't have an MBA, feels daunted when asked about \\"five yearly financial forecasts, strategic brand building, exit strategy\\" and other funky business terms. Guy's sense of humour and his ability to explain complex business terms in a plain English makes this book a must read for young entrepreneurs.
0553801503|5.0|First off, I must mention that 'A Feast For Crows' is the fourth book in the 'Song Of Ice And Fire' series, and this series is not one you can read out of order.  If you haven't read the first three, you will not have a clue as to what is going on.  In order, read 'A Game Of Thrones', 'A Clash Of Kings', and 'A Storm Of Swords' first.  Then you will be ready for 'A Feast For Crows'.<br /><br />Also, of the four books out in the 'Song Of Ice And Fire' series, 'A Feast For Crows' is by far the slowest moving.  Whereas the previous three books could not be put down, I was able to walk away from 'Feast' several times.<br /><br />Briefly, for those curious fans of Martin's writing and those anxiously awaiting this book, I will try to summarize a bit without giving too much away.<br /><br />The old and accustomed POV character chapters you will find inside 'A Feast For Crows' are Jaime, Samwell, Sansa (now called Alayne as she poses as Littlefinger's [...] daughter), and Arya (also calling herself Cat Of The Canals).<br />The new POV chapters are Queen Cercei, Brienne, Arys Oakheart (chapter: The Soiled Knight), Aeron Greyjoy (known as The Damphair, chapters: The Prophet, The Drowned Man), crippled Prince Doran Martell (chapter: The Captain Of Guards), Asha Greyjoy (chapter: The Kraken's Daughter) Victarian Greyjoy (chapters: The Iron Captain, The Reaver), and Arianne Martell (chapters: The Queenmaker, The Princess In The Tower).<br />Missing, of course, as most reviewers are noting, are Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister (the Imp), Stannis Baratheon, Davos, and Bran and Rickon Stark.<br /><br />In 'A Feast For Crows', some characters change and grow, some deteriorate, and some stay the same.  Really, not a lot happens as far as big events or timeline passing until the very end (sorry, I'm not saying what it is!).  It just seems that 684 pages, no matter how much I enjoy Martin's writing, is a bit of a long spell for such little development in the bigger story.  It felt a bit like an intermission between books 3 and 5.<br /><br />The additional information on the Greyjoy family was great, along with the addition of Cercei as a POV, but many of the others, including Brienne who is in the book a lot, were uninteresting at best.<br /><br />So why five stars?  Because Martin's prose is in top form.  He can still, simply with words, suck my into a magical time and place where I can breathe the air and smell the corpses hanging from the trees.  Although it is so very well written, making it worthy of five stars, it did fail to leave that burning sensation deep in my belly that makes me scream in frustration for the next book to come out.<br /><br />This time, the wait for the next in the series will be much easier, because I am not left with that fiery urge to know more.  It seems that publisher and author should have sought for that type of urgency in this book, trimming down the story to a tighter line, and leaving out Brienne, instead of splitting apart the \\"Whole Story\\".  In my humble opinion, that would have been a wiser and more monetarily intelligent decision.<br /><br />If you are a diehard fan, yes, it's worth the money.  If you are a lukewarm fan, wait for the paperback.  If you are not very excited about the series, then wait for a used paperback.  Enjoy!tween books 3 and 5.

B000B2YQX4|5.0|It's been FOUR lonnnnnnggggggg years, and they're finally BACK!  First off, let me just say that Exciter was an EXCELLENT album.  Yes, Depeche Mode did some experimenting and produced an overall mellow sound, but the finished product was nothing short of excellence.  Mellow Mode is just as good, and I think they should put out another \\"Exciter\\"-esque album. <br /> <br />But their latest, \\"Playing The Angel,\\" is such a great follow-up to \\"Exciter,\\" as it hearkens back to their early 90's era.  \\"A Pain That I'm Used To,\\" \\"John The Revelator,\\" \\"The Sinner In Me,\\" and \\"Precious\\" clearly have SINGLES status written all over them.  The rocking industrial sounds coupled with harmonious electronica and sonorous melodies IS WHAT MAKES DEPECHE MODE DEPECHE MODE (bottom line....couldn't have said it better myself, and I did), and it's all found right here in their latest album.  <br /> <br />The only gripe I have is the production.....they could've switched the songs up a bit.  The first half of the album is where all the great singles are, while the last half contains their dark, predominantly slow material (which is GREAT, mind you).  They just should've spaced them out differently.   <br /> <br />Although that's the only minor problem with the album, that's just what it is....MINOR.  After seeing them twice already, I have gained an even greater appreciation of this album and the band themselves.  They're on a solid road, and it can only get better if the trend continues!
0385507755|1.0|Three things amaze me about this book: <br /> <br />1. That Frey thought anyone would believe this embarrasingly awful macho fantasy story.  <br /> <br />2. That the publisher it was submitted to didn't spray coffee over every page as he/she burst into mocking contemptuous laughter when Frey describes facing down various Mafia Dons, storming crack-houses to rescue distressed damsels and beating a man to death for touching his thigh.  <br /> <br />3. That there are, apparently, millions of witless chumps out there who find Freys memoir remotely plausible, and even inspiring.  <br /> <br />This isn't quite the worst book I've ever read - its certainly in the bottom five - but nothing has filled me with despair at the poor taste and gullibilty of the general public quite like the success of this extremely silly and mediocre book.
B000BDJ61U|4.0|This is an expensive version of Kate Bush's best album which is simply a work of art. Beautiful in many ways where every single track is a masterpiece of composition.  Now this album mini-lp sleeve packaging is a work of art in itself and like most art, costs a bundle. The sound quality is patchy and the volume levels are higher for some tracks than they are for others. As this version of the disc is not remastered either, you'll have to decide whether or not to pay the much higher price for this disc if you either already have the remastered version of this or even any other version if the packaging is not important to you. If you are new to Kate's work and don't yet have this, you may have to decide if sound quality is important to you as well. Otherwise, although the tracks are good and the album itself is worth getting, I'm not sure if it makes economic sense to pay so much just for the mlps. Just my 2cts worth.
B000AARKOO|3.0|KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, which takes place at the time of the Crusades in Jerusalem, is a strangely low-key film considering the dramatic conflict of cultures going on during the time of the story. But somehow (and refreshingly) that seems to make it more realistic to me because dramatic and intense scenes are often more to advance the plot and are thus more artificial than representative of how people behave in real life. The movie's greatest strength is perhaps Ridley Scott's direction. The battle scenes are excellent, from the forest fight in the beginning, that reminds this viewer of the opening battle in GLADIATOR, to the siege of Jerusalem with siege towers and catapults and casts of thousands. The costumes and the sets are very realistic. For a history buff like me, it is a joy to have such versimiltude. In one scene I recall seeing a beat-up looking shield with several dents in it. That is great attention to detail. It was a nice touch in this subdued movie to have our near-mute hero Balian of Ibelin's lady love interest come riding wildly into a scene in bright clothes and then lower her veil to expose a exotically beautiful and intellgent face. Too bad the writers didn't put more of her sassiness and exotic color into KINGDOM OF HEAVEN; it could use a little perking-up. Another interesting device was the use of The Leper King of Jerusalem wearing a gold mask and being wrapped up in bandages to hide his disease. As for conflict, the Christian order of Templars, with large red crosses on their white tunics, are made the villians of the piece for wanting to fight muslims. There is a debate scene among the Christian lords where the Templars argue for war and the feeling is the Templars are blood-thirsty, evil thugs trying to stir up trouble. A few of them are even hanged for attacking muslims. On the other side, there is only a brief scene where a character approaches Saladin, the great muslim general, and reminds him of his promise to take Jerusalem. So, by weight of material, we have the muslims as basically nice fellows and some Christians as the bad guys, the implication seemingly being that they could all get along if it wasn't for warlike elements from the West. Imagine that! Well, this is Hollywood. Of course, the film doesn't tell you that the muslims had conquered Spain and had driven into France, threatening Europe with slaughter and slavery before they were stopped. But that is just a minor detail to be ignored by leftist film writers trying to get out their message and brainwash the movie-going public. The worst kind of historical fiction, whether book or film, is to wash a story about the past in the dirty water of today's politics. It is the writer's real task to tell it like it was in the past and, my friends, there are two sides to this story. Maybe, after seeing KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, which by the way I do recommend as an entertaining film and award three and a half swords out of five, you will go to the library or a bookstore and research the real story of the Templars and the struggle between Christian and muslim cultures, going on now since 700 AD.of material, we have the muslims as basically nice fellows and some Christians as the bad guys, the implication seemingly being that they could all get along if it wasn't for warlike elements from the West.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|At 3.5 hours this fascinating documentary can cover a lot of territory, and it does. Most interesting for many viewers who know Dylan only as a folk-rock star is the film's portrayal of his emergence from utter obscurity into national prominence by the age of twenty. Looking at old photographs and early footage, we see the first of his many self-inventions, based in large part on the songs of Woody Guthrie and nourished in the creative epicenter of Greenwich Village in 1960.<br /><br />For anyone who lived through the 1960s, the film also vividly recalls the political and social turmoil of that time, which did much to create the public figure of Bob Dylan the singer of \\"protest\\" songs. We see him thrust by others into the role of spokesman for a \\"new generation\\" clamoring for social justice. And it charts the evolution of Dylan into his incarnation as folk rocker, experienced by many loyal fans and other performers as a bitter betrayal, which is where the film leaves us, in the knowledge that he had outgrown one persona to embrace one that would command an even larger fan base.<br /><br />The film's length also permits reference to a large swath of mid-century musical history, ranging from Johnny Cash to Johnny Mathis. There are also telling glimpses into the recording industry as it both shaped and attempted to anticipate the evolution of popular taste during this time. And there is much more.<br /><br />What the film doesn't do, even in its interviews with Dylan years later, is reveal him as more than a gifted opportunist who somehow tapped into the collective unconscious of his time (or so his early career is remembered by others in the music business who are interviewed in the film). Even in the rare glimpses into his private life he is, as close friend Joan Baez remembers him, self-absorbed and unpredictable, finally enigmatic.<br /><br />Special features include performances of Dylan songs by Mavis Staples, Maria Maldauer and others. My favorite is Joan Baez's \\"Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word,\\" which mimicks Dylan's phrasing at points. For Dylan fans and anyone interested in the history of popular music in America, this DVD set is a total immersion in ten of its most amazing years.an Baez's \\"Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word,\\" which mimicks Dylan's phrasing at points.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I too have seen the play twice in both Toronto and Detroit.  The play is wonderful, why else would people see it twice?  Now, like anything else, the book is ALWAYS the best version of the story.  However, this is a great movie, I love it.  If you haven't seen the play, you'll LOVE the movie...and if you have seen the play, you will still love the movie.  It is a beautiful story, with beautiful music and beautiful actors who capture compassion, tragedy, romance and desperation all in one film.  I also think it is noteworthy that there are parts from the book in the movie that were not in the play.  This shows that the writers took consideration in making this film, which is rare, and a welcome addition.  Oh, and as for the few poor reviews of this film, someone who truly appreciates this story would never refer to this film as \\"PofO.\\"  Everyone can have an opinion, but this is a film that has earned its high rating.

B00008DDXC|5.0|This is the second Harry Potter movie and another winner! These movies just keep getting better. I'm glad that they are so close to the book, I'd be disappointed if they were off. With each passing year Harry and his friends get into more trouble and have to figure out a way to defeat Voldemort. This movie is suspenseful, a comedy, and full of drama. I absolutely loved it!
B000A1ENCU|5.0|Just a quick note to the people that are still doubting whether or not they should purchase the Taiwanese DVD: I can assure you all it is of excellent quality. The image quality is great and every bit as good as any of the (remastered) classics released in the US and Europe (like Spartacus, for example). The image is full-screen, but like many said before, this movie is from before the Rotoscope era. The box mentions the movie is B&W as well, but this is not the case. The DVD is in full glorious color. <br /> <br />The (Chinese) subtitles will only pop in when you select them in the menu, otherwise the image is subtitle-free. The sound is good as well, albeit 2.0 stereo only. <br /> <br />One catch though: apparently there are multiple versions of this DVD. The DVD I received looks nothing like the one pictured by Amazon; it has a MUCH more beautiful cover with Taylor and Kerr in a romantic pose... as a matter of fact, it's one of the prettiest DVD covers I've ever seen. Thus, I can only tell you that this version (purchased from a Taiwanese seller through Amazon) is the top quality version I received, I don't know about the version pictured on this site. <br /> <br />The text on the box is in English as well: there are no Korean characters on it whatsoever. The only thing that gives away it's Asian origins is the fact that the DVD packaging is slightly larger (I have more Chinese and Korean DVD's that have the same format). But that is no biggie: it only gives the gorgeous cover more chance to shine.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I love this CD.  Damian Marley seem to put out all the stops on this one.  It has good beats, cool lyrics, and still talks about current issues.  I've bought this cd around sept. and I still listen to it almost every day.  My favorite songs are: Road to Zion, There for you, Welcome to Jamrock, We're gonna Make it, and more.  There's actually not a song on this cd that I don't like.  If you love reggae, and even if you don't, go out and buy this cd... You won't regret it!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney's second album, and a sequel to the fantastic \\"...Baby One More Time\\".  <br />#1. Oops! ...I Did it Again  <br />This song is very \\"Britney\\", like Crazy and Hit Me Baby One More Time from her first album. 10/10  <br /> <br />#2. Stronger  <br />This one is also very \\"Britney\\". 10/10  <br /> <br />#3. Don't Go Knockin' At My Door  <br />This song is kind of club, kind of hip hop. Really cool, this shows that Britney's second album will be a lot different than her debut. Pretty good song. 7/10  <br /> <br />#4. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction  <br />Britney follows her tradition of remaking an old song. Before it was Cher's \\"The Beat Goes On\\", this time it's \\"Satisfaction\\" by the Rolling Stones. The lyrics are awesome, so is the beat and the music. The chorus is the best part. I think this song works even better as a Britney Spears song. The only part I don't like is the \\"I can't get no, uh, satisfaction\\" part. It sounds really corny. 7/10  <br /> <br />#5. Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know  <br />The first ballad on this album, I really like this. It's better than most of the ballads from her debut. Her voice really shines on this track. Parts of the music sounds very ethnic. The beat on the chorus is reminiscent of Pat Benatar's \\"We Belong\\". 8/10  <br /> <br />#6. What You See (Is What You Get)  <br />This is my favorite track on this album. Like the first two songs, this is very \\"Britney\\". She comments on how everybody complains about her image, basically saying she can look how she wants, and if you don't like it, too bad. :) You know I love those staccato notes. Really a great song. We should all be proud of who we are. 10/10  <br /> <br />#7. Lucky  <br />Almost tied for my favorite song. It's about a girl with fame and fortune who still isn't happy. Maybe she's trying to tell us how she feels. More of my lovely staccato notes, and really pretty music. I like the beat a lot. 10/10  <br /> <br />#8. One Kiss From You  <br />This is also a great song. Great melody and beat. This is a good dance song. KIND OF hip hop. This reminds me of Soda Pop from her debut, only this makes sense, is more developed, and is a much better song. 8/10  <br /> <br />#9. Where Are You Now  <br />This song is a bit \\"blah\\" and forgettable. I like the guitar. The song is just too boring. Ballads can be interesting. This would work good on a movie soundtrack, but I really don't see how it fits with the rest of this album. Not a bad song. 6/10  <br /> <br />#10. Can't Make You Love Me  <br />Another very \\"Britney\\" song, this isn't quite as good as all the others, but is still a pretty great dance song. Like a lot of Britney's songs, the chorus is the best part by far. 7/10  <br /> <br />#11. When Your Eyes Say It  <br />This song is much better suited for Mandy Moore's voice. I like some of the sound effects, but the music could be a bit more exciting. Not the weakest song on the album, but nowhere near the best. 6/10  <br /> <br />#12. Dear Diary  <br />The lyrics are really dorky and the song itself is pretty boring. 5/10  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a good album.
B000BP86OG|2.0|Both of The Darkness' albums have been quite a dissapointment. Don't get me wrong, the singles they release are brilliant, as the lead-off single proves itself that way on here. The album tracks are quite dissapointing, however. The first three tracks - one being a single - One Way Ticket, Knockers and Is It Just Me? are brilliant, and Bald is a fair effort, though the other six tracks are throw-away. Hazel Eyes is by far the worst of the bunch, it is really an affence to Kelly Clarkson (you might think that's stupid, but seriously, it is). Blind Man is an annoying song because of the extremely high-pitched voices. It just goes to show, once you've got one album of The Darkness', you have them all: the singles are great, atleast one album track is good, and the rest are rubbish. Still, it beats the tripe Franz Ferdinand created with their second album. Oh, and while I was on the subject of Kelly Clarkson, buy her Breakaway album - it's brilliant. So yeah, this is your second of the two mediocre Darkness albums.
B000099T2L|5.0|Well as we all know this was Beyonce's first solo album and, man, was it great! Her first hit from the CD (Crazy in Love) was an infectious, awesome song that made you want to get up and dance every time you heard it! After that her next smash was Baby Boy, a sexy, urban, dance song that was a pleasure to hear. Then the slow, but sexy, Me, Myself, and I was out and made every person who heard it feel like singing. Then, she got her sexy, sensual, TRL retired hit, Naughty Girl, which in my opinion is the best song on the C.D.! With this CD, Beyonce proves that she truly is amazing!  <br />1-Crazy In Love (9/10): awesome song but the rap brings it down a point  <br />2-Naughty Girl (10/10): Insane! How can anyone have so much talent and use all of it in one song! THIS SONG IS AWESOME! You can't listen to this song without turning the stereo on full blast.  <br />3-Baby Boy (10/10): Dance song that has an urban feel and a regae (spelling?) touch  <br />4-Hip Hop Star (9/10): A little too much rap but certainly a great song. Every word from her mouth is amazing!  <br />5-Be With You (10/10): Best ballad of all time! If you are a sucker for a killer slow song that you can have in your head all day...this is it! Man, this girl can sing!  <br />6-Me, Myself, and I (10/10): A feel-good-about-yourself song for all the ladies going through a break up. Awesome song.  <br />7-Yes (10/10): A great song! Addictive and singable.  <br />8-Signs (5/10): The song has a great beat but is inturupted by the totally random, totally annoying yelling of \\"REWIND!\\" by Missy Elliot...maybe she should stay in her own songs and leave the singing to the pros.  <br />9-Speechless (10/10): At first it seems like it drags on forever...but then after a few times listening to it you will love it! Great song.  <br />10-Thats How You Like It (10/10): Suprisingly the rap in this song doesn't sound bad and makes the song sound very nice! One of the few songs that can pull off a rap/pop duet.  <br />11-The Closer I Get To You (9/10): A little slow but definitly a great song. Great to sing along to.  <br />12-Dangerously In Love 2 (10/10): Great song, sounds like the Destiny's Child version of this song but is done with a differnt tune! What a voice she has!  <br />13-Beyonce Interlude (0/10): Boring and pointless. <br />14-Gift From Virgo (10/10): Great Song....no more to say...just great.  <br />15-Daddy (10/10):Great Song about her father's dedication and love. What a great kid...  <br />So in the end the CD is...well, great. Don't beleive me? Buy it! I promise you will not regret it! ENJOY THIS CD!!
B000BJS4BM|5.0|This is soooo much better than all three special editions of The Emancipation Of Mimi by Mariah Carey put together. Packaged in a wonderful long box, with a booklet full of wonderful pictures (44 pages), a journal which is great to read and look at (especially the diary entries by Madonna) (80 pages), 1-month free membership trial to the official Madonna fan club, and a bonus track Fighting Spirit, which is just as good as anything else on the original CD album. Expectations met. Exceeded, even. Total must-have.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I have ever listened to. It could almost be used as a compilation of 27 (yep, 27 on one CD, wow!) of the most musically perfect and appealing songs ever written. <br />From the early, care-free days of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\", and \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\", through to the more deep and insightful songs such as \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", as well as the undeniable classics like \\"Yesterday\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\", this CD has it all. <br />Possibly the only downside of this CD is that some of the Beatles greatest songs never actually made it to number one, such as \\"In My Life\\", \\"Back in the USSR\\", \\"Twist and Shout\\", \\"Ob-la-di ob-la-da\\", and of course the eternal \\"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\" Their exclusion from the CD will be disappointing for big Beatles fans like myself. <br />However, this does not detract from what is truly an amazing CD. It is one of the highest selling compact discs of all time, so it must be doing something right.
0553801503|4.0|Let me say that I did not follow the progress of this book on the website- I knew it was coming out, preordered it and proceeded to wait very patiently for its arrival. As a result, when I received the book and finished re-reading the preceding installment I picked it up with great anticipation, read through the oddly unfamiliar prologue and turned to the first chapter 'The Prophet'. Who? Huh? Quickly flipping through, looking at chapter titles I found myself wondering what the heck was going on- where were the Stark's? Tyrion? Wait a minute- Cersei gets her own chapters?<br /><br />Wading in anyway, on the basis of my enjoyment of the earlier books, I quickly found myself drawn in to a parallel story- no, this one doesn't follow the Stark's and the unexpected twists and turns of their lives as closely but yes, it was, in my opinion, a worthy read exploring far more deeply those story lines and characters that had been secondary before while expanding on Sansa and Arya's as well.<br /><br />The Maester's are brought front and center, and we'll apparently be seeing more of them, when old Maester Aemon is sent home to them (and through a single act viewed through Sam's eyes we see that Jon has truly become Lord Snow), Cersei's personality is more fully explored (shallow as it is to start with this is no mean feat) and watch as her distorted reasonings in the wake of her father's murder create a situation far beyond her abilities to control- and we see how very much she likes to be in control.<br /><br />Brienne of Tarth continues her quest to find the Stark daughters, as she has sworn to do, putting her in position for a startling (and macabre) discovery. The Stark's, while not as well represented as in earlier books are here again as well: Sansa has become Alayne to all appearances and, while we might see Littlefinger's intentions more clearly than she does, we see here that her naivete is slowly falling away. Arya, believing herself to be alone in the world now, has made a dramatic choice for herself and we watch her determination to become no-one and wonder if the wolf within her will allow it.<br /><br />So, to summarize- the book, even with the author's note at the end explaining it as one half of the whole which I really wish had been placed at the beginning of the book (and this is the entire reason for the 4 rating- had the explanation been at the beginning I would have given it a 5 but it is startling, to say the least, to walk into this book without having been prepared), is unexpected. You can not pick it up and immediately be immersed into the world you expected but if you stick with it, you will find that eventually you are brought back there with your perceptions expanded a bit and then, like me, you will be right back here looking to see when the next book will be available for pre-order. Soon, I hope.now, has made a dramatic choice for herself and we watch her determination to become no-one and wonder if the wolf within her will allow it.  <br /> <br />So, to summarize- the book, even with the author's note at the end explaining it as one half of the whole which I really wish had been placed at the beginning of the book (and this is the entire reason for the 4 rating- had the explanation been at the beginning I would have given it a 5 but it is startling, to say the least, to walk into this book without having been prepared), is unexpected.

B0002Z1EG2|5.0|19 out of the 21 songs on this C.D. are pure gold, and they are so varied in style that there is a song for every country music fan. One of the biggest plus-es of the album is that the songs are spread around. For instance, the album starts out with a tender ballad, then goes on to a dance-able anthem. On one of Ms. Twain's last albums, \\"Up!\\", she put all of the upbeat songs on one CD, and the slower songs on the second. The community of fans was split in half; some were pleased with the upbeat/downbeat division, and other fans wished that they had been mixed up amongst each other. I was more of the latter, so this CD was a great step up for Shania. Now, I'll give my reviews of each song:  <br /> <br />1. Forever and For Always 8.5/10---This song has a beautiful melody, vocals, and message, but the lyrics get a bit recycled.  <br /> <br />2. I'm Gonna Getcha Good! 15/10---One of my favorite Shania songs. It's upbeat, dance-able, and very fun to listen to and sing along with. The lyrics are simple, and yet very powerful. <br /> <br />3. Up! 7/10---The melody and vocals are good, but the lyrics are less than impressive. <br /> <br />4. Come on Over 9/10---Fun, carefree, and lighthearted, Shania is obviously having a good time as she sings this.  <br /> <br />5. Man! I Feel Like A Woman! 15/10---Need I say more? This excellent song has proven to be an anthem for women everywhere and a great karaoke number. Just TRY to listen this all the way through through without singing, or even humming, along.  <br /> <br />6. That Don't Impress Me Much 10/10---This is the dance version. This beat is great and the lyrics are well-written, and Shania has fun with it.  <br /> <br />7. From This Moment 10/10---This song, which is super-popular for weddings, is beautiful, sweet, and very touching. The instrumentals are stirring, and Shania's voice soars.  <br /> <br />8. Honey, I'm Home 5/10---This is definately not one of Ms. Twain's better songs. The lyrics are downright awful, and the beat is not very fitting. For instance, it goes from the foot-stomping aura of Queen's \\"We Will Rock You,\\" then the chorus has a honkey-tonk vibe.  <br /> <br />9. You're Still the One 10/10---A very beautiful and haunting ballad about eternal love (awww).  <br /> <br />10. Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You) 6/10---The melody is very catchy, but the lyrics are kind of repetative. Also, the one verse \\"Don't freak out until you know the facts/ Relax...Max!\\" throws me off every time I hear it.  <br /> <br />11. Love Gets Me Every Time 8/10---Catchy, carefree, and fun.   <br /> <br />12. No One Needs To Know 10/10---I really like this song about a secret crush. Very country-ish, it is well-written and catchy.  <br /> <br />13. You Win My Love 9/10---This song has a great tune. I can't find much wrong with it.  <br /> <br />14. (If You're Not In It For Love) I'm Outta Here! 8/10---This sultry song about men who carelessly pick up women has a great beat and lyrics, but it sounds like Shania's trying to make her voice sexy, and it doesn't really give the sound she was obviously going for (it sounds like she's drunk, actually).  <br /> <br />15. The Woman In Me (Needs The Man In You) 9/10---Slow and beautiful, but again, Shania is trying to make her voice sound sexy...*YOU SOUND FINE NATURALLY, SHANIA!* However, the song is one of my favorites.  <br /> <br />16. Any Man of Mine 15/10---The song that jump-started Ms. Twain's career. She shines, and was apparently having fun when she recorded this. It'll have you singing along in no time.  <br /> <br />17. Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under? 10/10---Catchy song about an adulterous lover. Shania's showing her country roots here, and she sounds great.  <br /> <br />18. Party For Two 10/10---This version with Mark McGrath is super dance-able, and the music and the two singers are great, but I like the one with Billy Currington better.  <br /> <br />19. Don't! 8/10---This slow ballad is very sweet and moving. The chorus is very haunting, and the backup singers do their job nicely.  <br /> <br />20. Party For Two 15/10---Who cares if Billy Currington sounds a little flat on his first few notes? He and Shania are exploding with chemistry, and that makes the song great. You'll want to jump up and dance with this song.  <br /> <br />21. I Ain't No Quitter 0/10---Oh my God. Shania, what were you thinking when you recorded this?

B00005OM4N|5.0|(1) I'M A SLAVE 4 U - No doubt we've heard this sexy and breathy slice of pop that certainly changed Spears's style, and whilst one of the standout tunes on the album, this type of sound isn't the basis of the album.  <br /> <br />(2) OVERPROTECTED - This is a more familiar Britney sound and she funks things up a little in this pop classic. Has a little *Nsync feel to it.  <br /> <br />(3) LONELY - One of the tracks Spears co-wrote, this is a sexy, aggressive R&B based pop tune that has one hell of a catchy chorus and proves how much of a credible writer she is. Definitely a must listen to song.  <br /> <br />(4) NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN - The album's signature ballad, and theme song to her film \\"Crossroads\\", is this goregeous number co-written by Max Martin and UK singer Dido. Spears' voice sounds incredible.  <br /> <br />(5) BOYS - Said to be one of Britney's personal faves, this takes a few listens to get used to. Produced by The Neptunes, who also did \\"Slave 4 U\\", it features more of Britney's breathy vocals. Defintitely a different kind of song.  <br /> <br />(6) ANTICIPATING - Another one of Britney's writing efforts is this cute Janet Jackson style, early Kylie sounding, pop tune that is pure fun to listen to. Shows she hasn't lost her pop roots completely.  <br /> <br />(7) I LOVE ROCK \\"N\\" ROLL - Hit R&B writer/producer Rodney Jerkins (Jennifer Lopez, Destiny's Child, Brandy) teams up once again with Spears for the cover of this classic rock track. Whilst their last collaboration funked up the Stones' \\"I Cant Get No Satisfaction\\", this time around they are staying very much close to the original content and Spears' voice suits it perfectly.  <br /> <br />(8) CINDERELLA - Another Britney writing effort is this fast paced pop tune, that keeps the pride of \\"Oops\\" alive. Funky track.  <br /> <br />(9) LET ME BE - Urban style pop tune is a standout. Spears co-wrote this funky, and short, pop track that highlights the change of direction to a more R&B setting.Is also featured on the soundtrack to \\"On The Line\\".  <br /> <br />(10) BOMBASTIC LOVE - Not a duet with Shaggy and not a hint of reggae pop anyway. This is another urban style pop tune that is instantly likeable, has a catchy chorus and a bit of a Pink feel to it.  <br /> <br />(11) THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE ME - Cute, catchy pop track mixes balladry and dance. Her voice is so cute and this is another instantly likeable tune that should appeal to her younger audiences.  <br /> <br />(12) WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME - Co-written by Britney's choreographer Wade Robson and Justin Timberlake, this was a highly anticipated track that lives up to it's expectations. Agressive vocals over a funky backbeat, and Timberlake's beatbox, make this an album standout. Timberlake also provides backing vocals.

B00006CXXU|5.0|This is Christina Aguilera's best work so far! I mean, it's notable that she put a lot of dedication, hard work, and persistence on it. Obviously, she's one the most talented female vocalists out there right now, with Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, and Whitney Houston running up for the same privileged title too. Something great is that Christina is also a lyricist, composer, producer, and executive producer on STRIPPED, which makes it an even more personal work. With this, she's proving that her voice and styles are very versatile. She goes from soulful ballads (Walk Away, Impossible, Beautiful, The Voice Within, I'm OK) to hard-core rock/alternative tracks (Fighter, Make Over); from encouraging mid-tempo tunes (Cruz, Soar, Keep On Singin' My Song) to dancy Hip Hop songs (Can't Hold Us Down, Dirrty); and, from funky beats (Underappreciated, Get Mine, Get Yours) to mellow R&B and \\"flamenco\\" styles (Loving Me 4 Me, Infatuation); all that spiced up with some revealing, sexy, and peaceful interludes. Some standups in STRIPPED are obviously Beautiful (a self-esteem giver gorgeous ballad), Can't Hold Us Down (a feminist anthem featuring Lil' Kim, based on how some men, including Eminem and Fred Durst, had tried to trash her), Fighter (a rockish and hot song, maybe about how her former manager betrayed her, but how it made her stronger), Infatuation (the story of her first love, her Puerto Rican ex-boyfriend), Impossible (a remarkable ballad written, composed, arranged, and produced by Alicia Keys), Make Over (a Courtney-Love-type song where she states that she doesn't need anybody to make her over), and I'm OK (a sad story about her abusive father, produced by 4 Non Blondes' lead singer, Linda Perry). The other songs are amazing too, just that I only listed the ones with the most personal meaning for her. STRIPPED has collaborations (production, lyrics, music, vocals, etc.) of Scott Storch, Linda Perry, Matt Morris, Glen Ballard, Rob Hoffman, Heather Holley, Steve Morales, Redman, Alicia Keys, Lil' Kim, Rockwilder, Dave Navarro, Ron Fair, etc.. I highly recommend this item because I consider it as a masterpiece. Please don't doubt on buying it.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Is An Excellent Drama, it has a very good story to it and it is a very realistic film about the cevil war & two people who are in love. it's also a movie about survival, vilonce and how man was so curupted back then. This movie has a lot of violent scenes and one big sex scene with jude law & nichole kidman. I don't recomend kids Under the age of 14 to see this movie. This movie has great effects and great actors. Jude Law does an excellent job and so does Nichole Kidman & Renee Zellweger does deserve the supporting Actress Award. This movie made 164 Million Dollars and got alot of awards and i think it deserved it. The special features in this movie were pretty good. I didn't know that Sacred harp was real music. This movie is also from a best selling Book.<br /><br />Plot: Inman(Jude Law) is a peaceful southern man, when Ada(Nichole Kidman) and her father comes to live in Cold Mountain Inman finds Ada very atractive and they both clic right away.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|With her fourth album, Britney Spears shows signs of musical growth and maturity - from the ambitious and mind-blowing \\"Toxic\\" to the sweet ballad \\"Everytime.\\"  <br /> <br />1. \\"ME AGAINST THE MUSIC\\" - The first single, featuring Britney's mentor and idol, Madonna. It's a good song with a nice beat, but Madonna's vocals ruin it.  <br /> <br />2. \\"(I GOT THAT) BOOM BOOM\\" - Great song...Britney attempts a move into urban territory and succeeds with flying colors. Should've been a single.  <br /> <br />3. \\"SHOWDOWN\\" - Another winner...Britney sounds incredibly sexy here, and the guitar riffs add a nice touch.  <br /> <br />4. \\"BREATHE ON ME\\" - Britney's voice blends perfectly into the music, and she sounds sultry and exotic. An outstanding dance track.  <br /> <br />5. \\"EARLY MORNIN'\\" - I wasn't sure what to make of this song the first time I heard it. It's a LOT different from Brit's usual music, but that's what this record is all about: experimentation. Moby did a fine job producing it.  <br /> <br />6. \\"TOXIC\\" - Quite possibly one of Britney's best songs EVER. It's flawless: Britney's vocals, the production, everything. Buy the album for this song alone, if nothing else.  <br /> <br />7. \\"OUTRAGEOUS\\" - I like this song, but it sounds like a reject from a Janet Jackson or J.Lo album. It should not have been a single, but it is a decent song nonetheless.  <br /> <br />8. \\"TOUCH OF MY HAND\\" - Britney's received a lot of flack and critcism for this song, but I love it. The lyrics are sexy (without going over-the-top) and Brit's vocals are amazing.  <br /> <br />9. \\"THE HOOK UP\\" - Fun, happy song with a reggae feel to it. I can't think of anything else to say about it.  <br /> <br />10. \\"SHADOW\\" - Everything a ballad should be...near the end, Britney shows that she does possess true musical talent.  <br /> <br />11. \\"BRAVE NEW GIRL\\" - An uplifting, inspirational song that feels like it should be in a \\"Legally Blonde\\" movie.  <br /> <br />12. \\"EVERYTIME\\" - A stark, heart-tugging ballad. Britney went the wise route and kept the song low-key, moving the song along with only her vocals.  <br /> <br />All in all, \\"In The Zone\\" is a true step forward for Britney...her voice is stronger than ever, her music is progressing in terms of maturity, and she proves that she is a force to be reckoned with.
0553801503|3.0|At the end of the last book I found it hard to keep up with all the different people and storylines, I'm not getting through this one. Even if there is an end somewhere 5-10 years from now, the books are becoming insurmountable obstacles. Other authors also suffer from the \\"neverending\\" syndrome, notably Jordan and Goodkind. For some reason, they find it difficult to end a series and start up a new one, perhaps because they want to keep their readers, perhaps because they are so involved in their work they can't see the whole picture - or maybe they can and that's the problem. You can't have every single person in a book, that's why you have main characters! I'm sorry if I'm being unfair, but I'm a little upset that a series I really liked has gone so completely out of control. You need to be a hardcore fan to buy this one. <br /> <br />
B0006284JQ|5.0|I know that a lot of people are posting reviews because they don't like Britney and her actions. Actions aside, she makes some of the catchiest pop music for pop music fans like myself. If you aren't a pop fan, I wouldn't suggest buying this, plain and simple. If you are a fan of pop music, then you should own this since Britney has practically defined our new era of pop music.  <br /> <br />That being said, Britney has always been one of my favorite artists, and although I have a bias towards her, I think that this cd is great. The only issue I have with it is its lack of chronology, which would have made the listen a bit easier and more enjoyable, listening to Britney evolve as an artist. Since I am a fan, however, and own all of her cds, this isn't a tremendous issue, for I still love all of her songs and think that regardless of order they can still be enjoyed. Although I'm not sure if they randomly selected the song order or not. So here's my track by track review:  <br /> <br />1. My Prerogative (7/10) - By far not my favorite Britney song. It's one of those songs that's great when I'm in the mood for it, but other than that I usually will pass on it.  <br /> <br />2. Toxic (9/10) - At first I liked this song, but never thought anything amazing about it. But then it was played everywhere and it really grew on me. Also one of her best videos.  <br /> <br />3. I'm A Slave 4 U (10/10) - I loved this song the second I heard it. Stylistically it was a dramatic change for Britney, as she really created one of the most sexually entrancing songs ever. The irresistibly belly-dancing beat and the panting of her voice makes this song impossible to dislike. Absolutely love it.  <br /> <br />4. Oops! I Did It Again (10/10) - Another song I yearned to hear when it first came out. I would sit in school singing the tune in my head, waiting to go home so I could listen to it; it's just so damn catchy! Really where Britney began her sexier era, yet in her still innocent way (nopun intended). One of the best pop songs ever written.  <br /> <br />5. Me Against The Music (8/10) - One of the things I don't get about the In The Zone album is this song. The album is terrific, but this song never really seemed on par with the others from that album. I think the only reason it was released as the first single was because Madonna was on it. When you're in the mood to dance, it's a great song, yet I feel it almost takes too long to pick up and to get into it. The song never really hooks you in and traps you there like many other of Britney's songs.  <br /> <br />6. Stronger (10/10) - A great song from a great album. So catchy and poppy; uplifting. A great song to listen to when you're down, and also a great song to dance to.  <br /> <br />7. Everytime (10/10) - This song took a little while to grow on me, but it really has now. I find myself singing it for no reason in random places. The soft, playful background music really compliments Britney's high singing and gives the song a childish feel that we haven't really ever heard from Britney before. Sad song, but good nonetheless.  <br /> <br />8. ...Baby One More Time (10/10) - This kinda ticked me off that they didn't put this song first; they could have really started the album out with a bang. Either way, this song is still amazing; one that I'm sure everyone knows. Has the catchiest chorus of any song I've ever heard. Honestly, it's no wonder America fell in love with this song from the start. This really is the perfect song for Britney and years later it's still just as fun and just as catchy.  <br /> <br />9. (You Drive Me) Crazy (The Stop Remix!) (10/10) - My favorite Britney song and video ever! I can't even tell you how stupendous this song is! She sounds so edgy in the beginning and the song just takes off from there; creating one of the best songs. Buy the greatest hits for this! (Among others)  <br /> <br />10. Boys (Co-ed Remix) (9/10) - I don't know why but Boys really is a great song. Yet there's nothing that should be great about it. The original had a dark vibe to it, which carries through a little bit on the remix. Overall it has a great club feel and it's a great dance song.  <br /> <br />11. Sometimes (10/10) - Another one of my favorite Britney songs. It has such a summer vibe and you can really hear Britney's singing prominently over the backup singers. A really cool, laid back, ride-along-to-in-your-car song.  <br /> <br />12. Overprotected (Darkchild Remix) (8.5/10) - I couldn't decide between an 8 or a 9 so I gave it an 8.5. The original was a flawless pop song, but this remix is kind of boring. The beat repeats a lot and it doesn't really go with the vocals that well. They really should have gone with the original. If you can look past that, however, the song is still pretty good to dance to.  <br /> <br />13. Lucky (9/10) - Really catchy and really good. Sounds similar to Oops and Stronger, but still a great pop song.  <br /> <br />14. Outrageous (10/10) - This is where chronology is an issue. It sounds so weird to have Outrageous after Lucky, but once you get into the next song you get over it. The Arabian beat and sexy undertone give this song an interesting vibe, with some pretty bizarre lyrics that make the song really fun in a weird way. Playful and sexy.  <br /> <br />15. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman (10/10) - Probably my favorite Britney ballad. I wish she sang more songs like this because it really showcases some of her vocals and part of her range never really exposed in other songs. A really pretty sounding ballad also with a really pretty video, although I never would have went up on those cliffs like she did!  <br /> <br />16. I've Just Begun (Having My Fun) (8/10) - The only reason it got an 8 was because I think the verses are kind of boring, but the chorus is great and extremely catchy. Not one of Britney's best, but still a welcome addition to this collection.  <br /> <br />17. Do Somethin (10/10) - Wow. Just wow.This song is something else. Stylistically so different, yet it works so well for Britney. The beat drives and the lyrics just make you wanna get up and dance. Kinda techo-poppy. If you're a Britney fan then you're gonna like this song. Such a great song!  <br /> <br />So overall there are a few missteps, but with every collection you will get songs that are and aren't your favorites. Unlike some greates hits, this collection has a greater number of songs that I can listen to over and over again. It's too bad that they left off Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know and From the Bottom of My Broken Heart, but perhaps they would have slowed down the collection, since Britney isn't really known for her ballads compared to her throbbing up-tempos.  <br /> <br />So, if you like pop music , get this cd. Otherwise don't.
0385512058|5.0|Never Eat Alone is a rare, detailed glimpse into how those with no special access can connect to those they want to meet.  For many people who are good at connecting, this activity becomes a way of life.  It's a profession and a hobby.  As such, connecting can become all consuming.  Many will find that aspect of Mr. Ferrazzi's story to be unattractive.  But I found his candor in this regard to be refreshing.<br /><br />If you step back from his enthusiasm for connecting, the mental attitudes and processes he describes are just what everyone needs to use who wants to be better connected and accomplish more.<br /><br />All of us know more than any one of us.  If you take two equally talented young people in any field, the one who is better at connecting will live a more successful life than one who tries to go at everything as a lone ranger.<br /><br />I have known dozens of master connectors.  They all do some variation of what Mr. Ferrazzi describes in this book.  Here is how I would distill those lessons:<br /><br />1.  Decide who you want to meet to further your objective of accomplishing more.<br /><br />2.  Learn more about the person.<br /><br />3.  Find what you can do to help that person in an area where they care.<br /><br />4.  Develop a strategy to meet briefly face to face.<br /><br />5.  Share what you want to do to help when you meet.<br /><br />6.  Stay in touch with more ways to help.<br /><br />7.  Attend events where other master connectors attend and link into fields which are not naturally yours by becoming acquainted with these master connectors.<br /><br />8.  Study those who are very good at this.<br /><br />If you keep in mind the sheer pleasure of making a difference as you do this, you'll soon be a superb connector.  I recommend undertaking this task on behalf of something you are passionate about such as a charity you support.<br /><br />One of the best parts of this book is that Mr. Ferrazzi is generous in sharing his mistakes.  The world doesn't end for you as a connecting queen or king if you offend a poo-bah.  You just pick yourself up and do better next time.<br /><br />I liked his humility about his limitations in other fields.  Peter Drucker would have approved of Mr. Ferrazzi's decision to work on what he has a talent and love for, connecting, rather than try to become more competent at things that are difficult and unpleasant for him . . . like quantitative analysis.  The story about how he got his start at Deloitte is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />Another strength of the book can be found in the excellent description of why people find President Clinton to be so compelling in person.<br /><br />Skip books about networking and relationship building.  Read Never Eat Alone instead!as a connecting queen or king if you offend a poo-bah.

B000BEZPQE|5.0|When I first popped this cd in the player, I thought \\"boy this sounds crappy\\".  The sound wasn't as refined as studio album and Corey's voice sounded a little road worn.   <br /> <br />What this live album gives you might not be the refined perfected sound you get from a studio album but it makes up for it with loads of energy.  This album gives you a different slipknot experience.  <br /> <br />Also, it get's even better if you can see that energy.  I recommend watching Disasterpieces to get the whole package.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I think the person who wrote the Amazon.com \\"editor's review\\" should be writing about stuff he or she understands. That review is way off-mark.
B00007BHOE|5.0|This DVD gives you a taste of what truly makes Slipknot an amazing band.  Their wild onstage antics are filled with energy.  If you have ever wondered \\"why the heck do they need 9 members?\\", this will answer your question.  This DVD shows how all 9 members add little pieces to the experience that is Slipknot.    The backstage stuff is great.  Getting to watch what they do to get ready for a performance is interesting.  I especially liked having all their videos, that had been released at that point, to watch.  I hope they release a new DVD that's this good and has the Vermillion and Before I forget videos on it.  I'll certainly purchase it when/if it comes out.    Also, this DVD gave me a new understanding of their recent 9.0 live album.  I didn't exactly like 9.0 when I first listened.  It sounded a bit unrefined and Corey sounded road weary. Getting to see exactly why their live album sounded so different probably added 2 stars to my rating of 9.0.
B000BNI99K|3.0|Rod, assaying these superb examples of American songcraft, reminds me of the Thing, in the Fantastic Four movie, trying to pick up a dime...his big, clunky hands of stone just don't have the touch, the sensitivity to do it. Rod, tackling these classics, is in exactly the same boat: he doesn't have the finesse, sensitivity or sophistication to bring it off... <br /> <br />And, just for the record, I do like his voice, find it very pleasant, and am in fact, a big fan of his early era recordings, particularly those he made with the Faces.
B000BPCCZA|5.0|What a great $%#$@! band! I can't say enough about them.  The biggest difference in Mezmerize/Hypnotize compared to their previous CDs is that Daron Malakian is singing more, which is extremely cool because you have two singers going back and forth on a lot of the songs.  The lyrics on both CDs don't make much sense, which anyone who has heard the CDs, would know..! lol.  Some songs have goofy lyrics with maybe a line or two that grab you like 'where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?' on \\"Tentative\\"... other songs that make no sense is \\"Radio/Video\\" but just listening to the melody in the song you forget that and just really take notice of how unusual the music and singing are, I often play certain songs over and over because of that just like I did with 'Toxicity'.  And who would've thought a song about celebrity softball would be so catchy, singing 'Tony Danza cuts in line' on \\"Old School Hollywood.\\"  \\"Lonely Day\\" is perhaps one of the standouts on the CD because of the raw lyrics and sad melody - it could easily be played at a funeral of a person that you will be missing after they are put to rest with lyrics like 'and when you die/I want to die with you/such a lonely day/the most lonliest day of my life'.  HEAVY.  The DualDISC was a letdown because the documentary, to me, was too 'Arty F@rty' and it reminded me of a lame student film by a college student and showed nothing normal or comprehendable for almost the entire running time.  I watched it once and will never play it again.  Mezmerize/Hypnotize are 2 of the best CDs to come out of 2005.  Great band, I hope they are around for a long time.  A very unique band.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I liked Star Trek.  But Star Trek was a sterile proto-socialist fantasy, without a comprehensible culture beyond starfleet itself. <br /> <br />I like Star Wars better, but despite the detailed world building it remained a fairly predictable space opera. <br /> <br />Firefly (and the Serenity movie) are the best damn science fiction I have ever watched on a screen.  I can't believe that there is no more of this to watch.  I will not believe it.  I am going to think really, really desperate and evil thoughts until someone gives me another fix. <br /> <br />OK, so I hate reviews that just say something was good and the network is evil for having cancelled it, no matter how true that is.  A person reads a review not to determine whether someone they have never heard of likes something, but, hopefully, whether they might like it.  So here is my pathetic attempt to describe greatness.  Why I loved Firefly <br /> <br />1. Detailed world building.  I can easily see how the worlds of humankind shown in this series evolved from the world of today.  Any projection into the future is hazardous, but at least this series makes a reasoned attempt at such a projection.  I see bits and pieces of the world we know, taken apart and reassembled on another stage, as, indeed, they will have been after the passage of 500 years.  Whether it is the Chinese characters in the shop windows, the opulent, almost Raj-like feel of the Tam estate and the clothes worn there, the eclectic, practical, almost wild west garb of the outer worlds, or the oriental but not quite specific derivation of Inara's quarters, I can tell that someone spent a lot of time and energy trying to trace out the lines of this future society.  Which leads me to <br /> <br />2. The emphasis on the everyday and practical.  There aren't any aliens cluttering up the landscape.  What's more, industrial zones look like there is active industry, rural areas have real farmers and miners.  Laser weapons exist, but there is a realization that putting a high speed piece of lead through a person is likely to be just as fatal (if not more so) than burning them with a laser.  (And I loved the \\"check battery\\" indicator on the laser pistol, too.)  We also get to see what sort of goods a future smuggler smuggles, and its not always \\"spice\\" or precious metals.  Firefly deals with medical supplies, concentrated food bars, engine parts, ceramics, seed, even a herd of cows for goodness' sakes.  Anything real people might want to get that they may not have.  They even talk about buying clay of high quality (though this is a cover) Which leads me to <br /> <br />3. A view of the future from street level.  There are few worldshaking events in Firefly, and what there are are seen from the viewpoint of ordinary people, hustlers, dirt farmers, \\"mudders\\", mechanics (and, yes, prostitutes, but preachers, too).  This show is not about ambassadors, jedi knights, queens, admirals or generals.  I think it's significant that Mal was a sergeant in the Independent army, not even an officer much less a field commander.  Which leads me to <br /> <br />4. Nine very unforgettable and well formed characters.  None of them are particularly extraordinary people (ok, River is, but that's the exception that proves the rule.  The series ended when we were just getting a glimpse of how extraordinary she is.  The movie tells us a lot more.  She is, however, still a \\"little person\\")  All of them are complicated, all of them are compelling, and all of them could make a suitable paper about character development in a college English class.  Sometimes I might think I like Kaylee best; her wide-eyed upbeat attitude, her poor white trash background (being as how that's what I am), her crush on Simon, or the bigger crush she has on engines.  I think of her lying wounded crooning \\"there's my good girl\\" to the ship.  Other times I can't help but like not-quite dumb as a post tough-guy Jayne, who always seems to want to kill somebody (and tries selling out fellow crew members once) but who wears the stupid hat his mother made him and agonizes over the young man who dies for him in \\"Jaynestown.\\"  Actually, I love them all, but I don't have room for more examples.  (My daughter, the English major, doesn't care for Inara and Simon.  I think she's wrong.  The show would be different without them.)  All of which leads me to <br /> <br />5. Real people dealing with real moral dilemmas.  Mal likes to think of himself as a hardbitten criminal.  Problem is, that in the course of the show he is constantly turning down jobs, backing out of them, protecting people with no hope of return, and doing other insipidly noble things.  He drives Jayne to distraction, but Jayne is not immune to this malady either.  None of them are.  Shepherd Book may comment that he seems to have gotten on the wrong ship, and Kaylee may lightly reply to Simon's question about what they are doing with \\"Crime.\\" but these are basically good people.  The epitome of this, of course, is the fact that Serenity takes in Simon and River, despite the trouble this is bound to cause them.  On the other hand, evil in the world of Firefly is both less obvious and more real.  (Clue: The Alliance is evil).  However, there is no leader in black robes with a maniacal laugh shouting out that here lies evil.  In point of fact, perfectly good people might and do honestly see the Alliance as a force for good, as exemplified by Inara's statement that she supported unification.  No, rather than being told that evil is here, we are shown it.  The epitome of this is what was being done to River, but there is much more.  \\"We meddle,\\" says River in the movie.  Darn right they do. <br /> <br />6. Contravention of stereotypes.  I always thought that if a villain told me he was going to hunt me down and kill me, that, rather than walk nobly away, I would shoot him in the head.  Mal does me one better.  He kicks the guy into a spinning turbine.  Another example: when Mal demands of a recalcitrant crew \\"Do you want to run this ship?\\", Jayne replies \\"Yes!\\", and all the flustered hero can think of to say is \\"Well, you can't.\\"  Not to mention other cool and different things enumerated above incidently, like the continued use of slug-throwing weaponry (and even non-laser swords and knives). <br /> <br />7. I can't enumerate all the really funny parts.  Just one example is when Jayne wants to trade Mal his favorite gun for the woman Mal supposedly married while drunk.  \\"She has a name,\\" says Mal, and Jayne replies, \\"So does this!  Vera . . .\\"  (Vera sees action in at least two episodes.  She is indeed a fine gun.) <br /> <br />The one thing I can't get my mind around is that this series is Joss Whedon's work.  I am something less than a fan of his other work.  I can't imagine in what corner of his brain he was hiding it; I just want to thank him for it.  I can't believe I missed the series when it was on tv.  I can't wait for another movie.  Can somebody take the hint out there?  I'm a bit desperate.
0525948023|5.0|I have been on a spiritual quest for 40 years always searching for enlightenment. Mr. Tolle's approach has been my focus for the last few years and I find it to be an excellent path. He has managed to translate all the truth into a clear message supported by the words of wisdom of many great spiritual teachers. It's a simple message. No need to seek enlightenment, we are already there. Always have been...always will be. The challenge is finding awareness of the actions of the ego...sometimes uncontrollable...and separating those actions from our true self which is part of the unmanifested. It's like we're Dr. Jykell (the unmanifested) and Mr. Hyde (the ego). <br /> <br />The concept of the New Earth is something that I have felt for a long time. We humans as a species are evolving to the next level of being where awareness of unmanifested and the ego will be more balanced as a result the insanity we see all over the planet will start to dissipate revealing The New Earth which is already there.

B00000JCOV|5.0|As is a sad fact with most decent bands their first cd is the best one and the same is true for Slipknot. This is a great cd with nearly no bad songs. Whatever kind of music you would say slipknot is rapcore, metal and such this cd is the best example of it. A must own if you consider yourself a slipknot fan.
0060872675|5.0|After reading \\"Thud\\" I came across \\"Where's my cow\\" in a local book store. I was looking for classic storybooks for our baby due in June. Excitedly I sat and read the book right there in the store with the other \\"classic\\" books lovingly placed on the floor.  Being near Christmas the shop was rather full and it wasn't long before I had more than a few people giving me odd looks.  This is because I couldn't stop laughing, and being pregnant and somewhat emotionally unstable I was also almost in tears when reading the last line \\"That's my daddy\\"     My husband and I LOVE Terry's books and treasure our copy of Where's my cow!  AND the choice to make Sam Vimes look like Pete Postlethwaite is not a coincidence, it is how Terry describes how he thinks Sam looks.
B000003S0B|3.0|...this album wouldn't really be a cutout today. It would be part of a sixty-something-minute \\"In the Court Of the Crimson King\\", consistent with the length of present-day Crim albums. The resulting expanded \\"Court\\" would contain the good stuff like \\"Pictures Of A City\\" (a hard-hitting piece that would make it so \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" wasn't the only hard-rocker), \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" (a good ballad in the style of \\"I Talk To the Wind\\"), \\"In the Wake Of Poseidon\\" (a decent emotive number that's not as much of an apocalyptic downer as \\"Epitaph\\") and \\"Cat Food\\" (a whimsical number whose like doesn't appear on \\"Court\\"). They could have left out the divided trilogy \\"Peace\\" because these interludes exist only to support \\"The Devil's Triangle\\", a takeoff on Holst's \\"Mars: Bringer Of War\\" that Tomita did a better job on with his Moogs, and Keith Emerson did about as well with years later with his mega-Yamaha. Really, the thing should have remained a live show excercise that never should have seen the studio. Fripp proves here that, not only is he not that good a keyboardist, but the Mellotron can be a horrible lead instrument. Fripp exposes about every flaw the instrument has here. The thing works well in songs like \\"Poseidon\\" and the earlier \\"Epitaph\\", where it isn't overexposed and can enrich the arrangement. But if you use it as a main instrument, you got your timbre problems caused by undersampling in the tape drum. You got your tracking lags because the thing is mechanical, not electronic. It is a mid-20th century instrument after all. And you got over 11 minutes of what sounds more like a broad parody of \\"Mars\\" than anything else. So here's a suggestion. If you buy it, treat it like the second disc of \\"Court\\" and program your player past this mishmosh of noise and its companion pieces. As other reviewers said, this is more a companion disc than an album in its own right. As far as where to get it besides the sellers here, maybe they offer it on Crim's own site Discipline Global Mobile.Discipline Global Mobile.
B00005U8EM|5.0|My appreciation for this movie has only grown over time, heightened by my epiphany today that I am currenly stuck in Groundhog Day.  I think we all have been at one point or another.  Two key lines from the movie:  \\"What would you do if you were stuck in the same place, and every day was the same, and nothing that you did mattered?\\"  Phil speaks this line to two drunks in a bowling alley, and the response he gets is, \\"That about sums it up for me.\\"  Haven't we all been there?  Near the end of the movie, as Phil has finally completed the day done right, he says, \\"No matter what happens tomorrow, I'm happy now.\\"  That line breaks the spell, and Phil is free to move on to February 3rd and beyond.  In between he struggles with every possible way to try to find happiness, and the despair of not being able to find it.  In the end, it is the realization that happiness does not depend on our circumstances, it depends on our attitude, and the choices we make.

B000BP86OG|5.0|I love the first album of The darkness ... but this second album are more personal, varied & complex. <br />It's a tribute of love to the best rock bands of the history (Led Zeppelin, Def Leppard, the Who and of course Queen). <br />The singers of these band are impresive and excelent. The guitars sound very good & the batery are extraordinary. <br />These are sound forceful & beautyfull in the same time. These are a very great band and it waits for a great future to them. ;)
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Ok well first off the very first time i heard this band i automatically thought Fall out boy and turned it off. Im not the biggest fan of FOB. I decided to give it a second chance and to my suprise the lyrics are catchier the guitar better written and the vocals more interesting. The lyrics dont even compare to FOB and should never be. I am in love with this band. Every track especially number 7 & 10 are amazing. i suggest everyone who doesnt like death metal to pick it up.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I buy this album and I espect more than the last depeche mode album named Exciter. My expectations are accomplish. It's very dark album ... these lyrics are very depeche mode filosophy. This album groups the best thing of this new age band. <br />The dark side of Black celebration, the intensity of Ultra, the     danceable tunes of music for the masses and Violator and the baroque thing of the sounds faith and devotion. <br />It's a complete album ... the singers (Graham & Gore) still greats, the keywoards sounds very modern & complex, and the minimal texture of Gore guitar are excelent. <br /> <br />**** 1/2
B000BB1MIC|5.0|You know, I'm a little late in reviewing this season of Gilmore Girls, and all of the previous reviewers are right on the money, but I thought I share in the Gilmore love fest here.  <br /> <br />There are so many monumental scenes and occasions in this season that make it such a must-see and in my case a must re-watch over and over! The season builds-up momentum and really hit's stride when marking it's 100th episode anniversary, (that was a great episode) and I have to agree with many, Lauren Graham deserves Emmy consideration! Nonetheless, many Luke and Lorelai fans will adore this season because the best stuff really comes from them.  Emily is meaner then ever, Paris is just as nuts as she always is and yes, Rory has a new love interest, there's just one problem he doesn't commit well.   <br /> <br />Honestly the last episode of this season is the best of the series so far.  I can't wait to watch them all over again, because I know there will be something I'll notice that I didn't catch before.   <br /> <br />If your unsure of investing in the Gilmore Girl sets then watch an episode of season 6 airing now, which is turning out to be, believe it or not, even better then season 5! It's already a shoe in for a 7th season and deserves all the praise it's getting, and all the praise the writers are getting for making us the fans fall in love with these characters all over again. There is no doubt in my mind that this series will eventually end with just as much whit, spunk, charm, warmth, and popularity as it did when it began and when that sad day comes I will have a complete set of one of the most fabulously crafted shows to ever grace our TV sets.  Again, I am amazed at how these actors and writers make us feel so much in such a short amount of time. Time now, we can relive again and again whenever we please.   <br />
0452282152|2.0|This is a very crass book. If you're looking for a clean, inspirational book, this is NOT it. I only have this book because it was a reading assignment for college. Not a favorite on my list.
1573225517|5.0|This is clearly my favourite book by Nick Hornby. In this book, Hornby mainly explores the male psyche (and is frighteningly accurate in its portrayal), human relationships (as seen from a typical guy's point-of-view) and music. The only other major Hornby obsession missing from this book is sports or football, to be specific (go find and read Fever Pitch). <br /> <br />Rob is the owner of a music store, Championship Vinyl and a loser who knows a thing or two about music and girls. He re-evaluates his life by making a top 5 list of break-ups when his live-in girlfriend Laura leaves him. In the process, he meets his ex-flames on the list and the teenager-living-in-a-30-odd-year-old-body of Rob comes of age. Finally, he reunites with Laura and as they say all's well that ends well. <br /> <br />A must read for grownup men and all women (and girls). Specifically, for grownup men who refuse to let go of their adolescence and for women who want to get a peek into the male psyche and understand why men will always be boys at heart.        <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I have to admit I was a fan of the series from day one.  I loved the world Joss created, I was invested in the characters and I was very sad when the show was canceled.  So, when \\"Serenity\\" was announced I was thrilled but nervous as well.  After all, not many TV shows can successfully make the transition to the big screen.  But my fears were all for naught as I sat in a darkened theatre and watched this group of unlikely heroes fulfill my highest hopes and expectations.  The story line is smart, sharp and doesn't pull any punches.  There were moments when I had to actually remind myself to sit back in my seat, so intense was the action.  There were moments I found tears running down my cheeks, followed immediately by laughter.  If you are not a fan of Firefly the series, you can still fully appreciate \\"Serenity\\". It has something for everyone, action, adventure, romance, light comedy, and most of all, it has a story line that makes sense and doesn't cheat the audience.  I highly recommend this movie and once you've seen it you too will become a fan!
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I was one of the lucky winners of the Kong is King.net World Premiere Ticket contest, so my husband and I had the pleasure of seeing KING KONG in Times Square's Loews E-Walk Theatre. I knew I'd like it the minute I saw the Art Deco opening credits, very reminiscent of RKO's style. The movie only got better from there, carrying us moviegoers on a roller-coaster ride of adventure, romance, and eye-popping special effects. What raises Jackson's take on KING KONG above other rock'em-sock'em action blockbusters is that it's so clearly a labor of love in every sense of the term, a spectacle with soul and spunk. It's not every rollicking adventure film that begins with scenes of life in 1933 New York City, when the Great Depression was at its worst. No wonder plucky but vulnerable actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts is at her most beautiful and winsome as a more proactive version of Fay Wray's star-making role) is willing to take a chance with fast-talking movie producer/director Carl Denham (Jack Black, a rascally delight) on his latest project, involving leaving for the South Seas that very night.<br /><br />The characters are no mere genre archetypes; before their adventure begins, Jackson and his talented cast let us get to know and care about every one of them. When crewmen from the S.S. Venture get injured or killed by Skull Island's various fearsome natives and beasts, we mourn them. When Ann and playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody combines strength and sensitivity wonderfully as this unlikely hero. He gets my vote for Movie Mensch of the Year!) connect on screen, we're moved and rooting for them to get together, especially after they share one of this year's best screen kisses. Even the calculating Denham wins us over with his sheer force of will. A real Orson Welles type, the guy just loves making movies -- and money -- so much he'll go to insane lengths to make his project a reality, whether it involves outrunning his creditors, shanghaiing Driscoll on the Venture, tricking his cast and crew onto uncharted Skull Island, or dragging poor Kong across the sea from his island home to New York City.<br /><br />Most importantly, King Kong himself captivates us, thanks to a combination of WETA's amazing special effects and the range of emotion provided by a motion-captured Andy Serkis.  If only one cast member gets an Oscar nomination, I say give it to Serkis for his wonderful performances as both Kong and Lumpy the cook! :-) Kong has never been just another scary big ape in any of the previous film versions of his story, but Jackson and Serkis make him particularly engaging, not just because he looks so convincingly weatherbeaten, but he moves like an ape (on all fours, thank you) and has the facial expressions of a human. As a result, we can see how Kong's terrifying side is influenced by his tender side. Yes, I said \\"tender.\\" How else can you describe his protectiveness towards Ann on Skull Island after she wins him over by performing her lively vaudeville act? When Kong does go nutzoid, it's because either he or Ann are being threatened, whether by people, planes, or Skull Island's jaw-dropping, scream-inducing array of monsters and aborigine tribespeople. Jackson & Company give the big guy plenty of dizzying set pieces to show his stuff, involving everything from dinosaurs, toothy insects as long as your arm, and speeding taxicabs in New York City traffic (the scene where Brody did his own stunt driving; all those years of drag-racing on the streets of Woodhaven, Queens really paid off! :-), to say nothing of the dazzling Empire State Building climax. Moreover, Andrew Lesnie's cinematography is as gorgeous as it is kinetic; Adrien Brody should make sure Lesnie photographs every film he's in from now on, because he's never looked so handsome as he does here! :-) KING KONG is over 3 hours long, yet I never once thought to look at my watch.

B0007DPME4|5.0|_I reread this little book before attempting to review it. I remembered that it was a mad mantra of transcendent power from the heart of hell, but I didn't remember how nondated it was. This work is fresher and more relevant than 99% of what passes for poetry today. How can something last nearly 50 years without going stale or becoming trite? How can it be even more real now? Maybe it is because Ginsberg ripped it live, screaming, and bleeding from a place beyond time and beyond space. He tore it from the living bowels of MOLOCH itself and showed it to HIM. After all, what does divine madness know of time?<br /><br />This poem is transcendence itself. It demonstrates that when you plunge into the deepest pit of hell it either kills you, or perhaps it burns out your insides so that you become a soulless zombie, OR you transcend it and rise howling to become a Mad Poet Saint who can truely encompass the Sacred in the Profane.<br /><br />_Read this poem, and the others like America, A Supermarket in California, Sunflower Sutra, Wild Orphan, and In Back of the Real. It's almost frightening how relevant to daily life it is. If you didn't know it, you would never guess that it was written in the 50's. Of course Ginsberg does invoke, holy eternity in time holy the clocks in space the fourth dimension, in the Footnote. Maybe that's why it's timeless. As Cassady used to say, we know time, yes, we know time....<br /><br />_I wish I would have been there for that first public reading in San Fran with Kerouac running around the audience passing the wine jug. On all the planes, the Gods themselves must have jumped back in shock as a flaming monkeywrench of living poetry was jammed through the spokes of the great quivering meat wheel of conception....
0743277708|5.0|When I went off for my first semester of college my father gave me $100 with which to buy textbooks, which certainly dates me and will once again astound my own college aged children as to what life was like in the last century. After buying everything for my classes I had enough money left over to buy a hard cover copy of \\"Watership Down\\" by Richard Adams for $6.95, which for people who love books is certainly a great way of representing the ravages of inflation over the years. I decided to read a chapter of \\"Watership Down\\" each night before going to bed, thereby marking the beginning of my obsession with reading a chapter of something each day that has nothing to do with school. When my dorm roommate became as hooked on the story as much as I was he and I would read chapters aloud. Fifty days I got to the book's epilogue with the same sort of sadness that it was all over that I experienced getting to the end of the \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy.<br /><br />Living in the Sandleford Warren with its Chief Rabbit and Owsla maintaining a comfortable social order, Hazel and his little brother Fiver are content enough. But Fiver has the gift of prophecy, and when he warns that the warren has to be abandoned right away or they are all going to die, Hazel and a small circle of friends believe him and leave despite the fact that have no idea where they are going. Fiver envisions a great high place where they can be happy and safe, but there are a series of imposing obstacles to overcome, from not only humans and predators, but other wild rabbits as well. Consequently the basic story of \\"Watership Down\\" is the ancient quest for home, although in this case it is a new home that represents a wild rabbit's idea of utopia.<br /><br />The greatness of \\"Watership Down\\" rests on the sense of realism that Adams brings to his story wild rabbits. Adams studied Lapine life in R. M. Lockley's \\"The Private Life of the Rabbit\\" in order to keep his rabbits real. But beyond the way rabbits live in nature Adams provides them with a history and a culture, represented not only in the stories they tell of El-ahrairah (the Prince with a Thousand Enemies), but their beliefs in Frith the lord sun, and their simple games such as bob-stones. When confronted with sticky situations they are able to use their ingenuity to come up with surprising solutions that are still within the realm of possibility for real rabbits. I always liked the way Hazel, Blackberry and the others have to work out these puzzles, straining for a leap of intuition and cognitive insight that seems just beyond the reach of their relatively simple minds. So while these rabbits are capable of doing more than others of their kind, Adams keeps their efforts remarkable rather than magical.<br /><br />We also pick up a few choice words from the language of the rabbits (e.g., \\"silflay\\" is to go above ground to feed, \\"homba is a fox), which ends up paying off with one of my favorite moments in the book when Bigway utters a simple but effective curse. The lesson of the story is clearly that bigger does not mean better, for Hazel is neither the strongest nor the smartest of the rabbits that he leads, but he had the best qualities of leadership. Each of the rabbits that join Hazel on the quest to find Watership Down and build a new life there offers something to the ground, and the distinctive personalities that Adams creates for each of them adds to the novel as well.<br /><br />Of all the books that I have that I like to pick up from time to time and read again my favorite parts, \\"Watership Down\\" is the oldest. As a children's story is it simply one that is too good for most children, but without the deep allegorical elements that afflict so many other great children's stories. Perhaps that is why this novel has become so beloved, because it speaks to the child in all of us and the simple virtues that we all want the world to embody. Having read the book again from start to finish, I was not surprised to find that it is still as good as I thought it was when I first read it many years ago.was not surprised to find that it is still as good as I thought it was when I first read it many years ago.
0451123131|5.0|_When I reread this book after so many years I found myself wondering if we were ever really like this. The innocence, the lack of pretention, the sincerity - it is so totally alien from what this society has become. Sure Jack Kerouac had his problems with booze and relationships, but at his core there was somehow this absolutely blinding glare of innocent purity. Here was a man whose primary concerns were always the meaning of life, the nature of god, the suffering of innocents, whether he was boozing it up in a bar, hopping a freight, or hold up in a look-out cabin on top of a mountain. Jack Kerouac was a true poet in a world were poetry was in abysmal decline both before and after. Jack Kerouac's life was a spontaneous living poem- the dionysian poem of the living holy fool.<br /><br />_This is my favorite of all Kerouac's novels. I've had people comment about how I must have patterned a huge part of my early life on this book. I remember thinking so too, except all my wandering and wondering took place before I even heard of Jack or his books....

Furthermore, all three of them will risk going to jail to sabotage the company with a computer virus.  <br /> I remember watching this movie when it first came out. That was 6 years ago and I didn't understand a lot of the crude and inappropriate jokes. It was a lot more funny watching it the second time and there was parts of the movie that I didn't remember. <br /> Everybody hates their jobs in the movie Office Space and they aren't even worried about getting fired. They take their anger out on printers and copy machines. When Peter sleeps at night all he thinks about is how much his life sucks and that he wishes he could lay around and do nothing all day. Some employees even day dream of burning down the building. Working at Inotech, Makes the lives of the employees a living hell. Anybody who works there would rather get laid off then to stand another day working for Mr. Lumberg. <br /> For Peter, Michael and Samir everyday is the worst day of their lives. Peter even goes to a psychologist to discuss his life and how much he hates it. The psychologist helps him, however, with hypnosis. He isn't the only one that thinks his life sucks. His girlfriend Joanna works at a local diner and hates her job so she freaks out and quits. They need to find a way to get even. <br /> Furthermore, all three of them will risk going to jail to sabotage the company with a computer virus. The virus rounds off small amounts of money and transacts money from the company into a neutral bank account. They figured little by little money would be transferred so no one would notice the small amounts missing. The three believed that even if they got caught they would not even have to serve time, however, when $305,000 was transferred to their account they thought different. <br /> This movie was greatand it had a good plot. When I saw the cover at Blockbuster I figured the movie would be funny but with no real story, I was wrong. A good story with good characters made it enjoyable to watch this movie. <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|Rarely have I bought an entire album worth of music that I can play all the way through without skipping a song!  But that's exactly what I've been doing since I got \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" the other day! <br /> <br />I really don't need to talk about which song is my favorite; they're all hits to me.  Virtually every song on here is worthy of being a single!  The weakest song on this set is \\"Say Somethin'\\" with Snoop, and I'm ONLY saying that because the song doesn't highlight her soaring voice to the fullest.  That said, I'm even in love with THAT song! <br /> <br />Even though she employs a variety of producers, the music maintains consistency of style.  And her voice is sparkly; she doesn't let the music overwhelm her.  It ain't even possible! <br /> <br />She closes with the powerful and inspirational \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" and then I just wanna' start all over again.  I think I'll listen to it again!  And then buy the Ultra Platinum Edition with the extra songs and DVD. <br /> <br />I've never been a Mariah fan per se (she's had songs that I like), but NOW she's got me wrapped around her pinky finger!

B0000X2EOW|3.0|This is my all-time favorite movie (it's up there with \\"The Princess Bride\\" and \\"Willow\\"), and when I heard that this Collector's Edition was coming out, I had to buy it.  However, I was very dismayed to find that this Edition has hardly any decent Special Features, apart from the 'behind the scenes' documentary that was not remastered and has muffled/distorted sound.  I was looking for audio commentary (maybe by David Bowie and/or Jennifer Connelly, or possibly a Henson family member) or some better behind-the-scenes docs (maybe click on a button while the movie is playing and you get a behind-the-scenes look of that particular scene).  I was also hoping of some more conceptual artwork (or even a commentary) by the great Brian Froud.  (I have always been looking for an \\"art of\\" book for this movie, but all I have found is Froud's 'Goblin Companion'--which is great, but there has to be more conceptual artwork for this movie than that). <br />Anyway....I love this movie, but the Collector's Edition could have been more significant.

Pynchon's style is dense and you'll find yourself reading sentences two or three times before you can make out the grammar.   <br /> <br />The story reads like a mystery, but this plot is only a cover for the philosophy Pynchon is proposing. Once you find the philosophy, though, a second and third read will reveal that the story of Oedipa and even the structure of the book are examples of that philosophy. Oh yeah, and its funny as hell too. <br /> <br />If you can deal with Pynchon's style and stave off the idea that he is simply toying with his readers, then The Crying of Lot 49 is one of the most rewarding little books you'll find.
B000BNI90O|5.0|WOW, this set just arrived and I'm going through it now, and cannot believe how complete this is !!  <br /> <br />This isn't a set that should be rushed through, but rather enjoyed as it contains music, a DVD with all the tracks and a book that goes through the soundtrack and the different themes... <br /> <br />My only gripe is that I'll have to wait for the other two complete film scores !!!!!!!!  <br /> <br />If you enjoy LOTR, Howard Shore, or movie soundtracks this is a MUST HAVE in your collection !!
0553801503|4.0|Yes, it took forever for this book to come out, and yes, GRRM decided to split the story in half, making us wait until next year for more Tyrion, Jon, Bran and Dany. But even though it's missing some of the best characters, AFFC is an important addition to the series. For one thing, it's the best written book of the series so far. It's also got the most thematic depth (for instance, the imagery of the titular carrion crow that keeps popping up). This volume takes a step back from the action, focusing on the development of several characters, and showing us the toll the war's taken on Westeros. GRRM gives us some very juicy revelations about both the backstory and the future of the series. As long ASOIAF fans don't go into it expecting another Storm of Swords, there is a lot for them to love and ponder in this book. Let's just hope GRRM makes good on his promise to deliver book 5 within a year - I want to know who or what Coldhands is!
0385513755|5.0|When museum curator Jacques Sauniere is murdered, he leaves a cryptic message to his granddaughter, with whom he had been at odds with for roughly a decade, Sophie, to find Robert Langdon, and mentions the Mona Lisa. This is the stage set in the novel The DaVinci Code, by Dan Brown. In  the first few hours of the night, Sophie and Langdon race through the Louvre museum, discover what they will soon know is a Swiss deposit box key, and become fugitives on the run from the French Judicial Police. After opening the deposit box, the code involving the infamous Fibonacci sequence, they become in possession of the Piory of Sion's keystone - supposedly the map to finding the Sangreal documents and the Holy Grail. Over the course of merely twenty-four hours, Langdon learns of evidence leading to the belief that the Holy Grail may actually be Mary Magdalene, who possibly gave birth the Jesus Christ's child. Sophie finally learns the eerie truth about her family, particularly her grandmother and brother. Both accomplices learn about the Priory of Sion, a secret society founded in 1099, whose purpose is to protect the Grail, and Opus Dei, a highly devout Catholic branch that participates in corporal mortification. Basically, they are the opposite of the Priory. Langdon and Sophie, with their combined knowledge of DaVinci's works, uncover bone-chilling clues to the answer to Sophie's grandfather's murder, and what really happened to her family that night.<br /><br />You have to get the illustrated edition, otherwie you will be totally lost and have to get on the internet to look up everything. That disembodied had in \\"The Last Supper\\" was just...freaky.
B000000WFF|5.0|With no doubt, their first album \\"Spice\\" will be seen as one of the essentials of pop music for the 1990's. Yet, \\"Spiceworld\\" the Spice Girls second album clearly outshines their debut on every level.<br /><br />Since \\"Spice\\" had originally been released in 1996 to the world (barring America who would see it in 1997) when 1997 rolled around, it was time for a new record.  The Spice Girls knew what was in order, no longer content to be just the wacky British wannabe's next door on the previous album. Their look went on to the slicker, yet still poppy, iconic vigor. They took what pop idols such as Boy George, Kylie Minogue, Madonna had given them as teens & applied it here.<br /><br /> \\"Spiceworld\\" is exactly what the title states, the Spice Girls going global, embracing a multitude of pop sounds from all over & with ease. The first single & cut \\"Spice Up Your Life\\" opens up like a mad carnival. While most pop groups do the \\"latin sound\\", \\"Spice Up Your Life\\" remains fresh to this day due to it's sheer sponaeity.  The hook, the verses, the music all blend into a seamless whole, a perfect pop concoction. This was also the cut that made me the fan I am today.<br /><br />Further singles illustrated this such as the Motown sass of \\"Stop\\", & soul pop ballad confection (possibly their finest moment?) of \\"Too Much\\".  The latter proving that the Spice Girls had a strong knack for ballads. Another notable ballad is that of \\"Viva Forever\\" which deals with a love that has long passed. Vocally, the Girls would only outdo themselves on the followup to this record, the strings, spanish guitar all meld beautifully.<br /><br />Other highlights include the pseudo-R&B number \\"Saturday Night Divas\\" which is a midtempo jam, it takes it's time & is better for it.  The bass is funky & the synth work is funkier. This sits alongside the disco-fied \\"Never Give Up On the Good Times\\" quite well. The closing number \\"The Lady Is A Vamp\\" ranks as one of the finest Spice album cuts.  A \\"big band\\" number finds the Girls giving homage to Diana Ross, the Grease films, Marilyn Monroe, & Twiggy amongst others.<br /><br />Vocally, you see the Girls continuing to improve, some being excellent stylists (Victoria, Geri, Melanie B), while others are clearly talented vocalists (Melanie C, Emma).  The harmonies, which this group never gets credit for, are always memorable, never predictable & blend so beautifully.<br /><br />Lyrically, the material is still about love & having that love on your terms.  Those ideas as well as the \\"positive vibes\\" are very inspiring. For me, it was hard to review this album without bias because the Spice Girls were the first group I ever got into without my parents musical influence.  This was the first album I ever purchased & it set the musical bar for what I expected in pop albums.  Also, there is the fact that this album has soundtracked my life since I was thirteen.<br /><br />All those variables aside, \\"Spiceworld\\" is a record that pop lovers should enjoy & need to hear. It's cool, fun, sassy, & what we are sorely lacking today in pop music. Even though Geri would leave after this record & the excellent album \\"Forever\\" followed in 2000, this ranks as the best albums of the three they released.<br /><br />Amazon should also move the film reviews of \\"Spice World\\" to the movie review sections for that film.homage to Diana Ross, the Grease films, Marilyn Monroe, & Twiggy amongst others.

B000A7Q2DM|1.0|Their debut was spectacular.  Why did they have to do this?  I don't write reviews, ever, but I loved the spacey alt rock feel of the debut, and this is my chemical romance at its finest.  Why? Jared!  You have enough money, don't sell out on your music too.
B00014TJ7K|4.0|This is a great CD, but the reissue sucks. Where is \\"Lay His Head,\\" an excellent Harrison song? Record executives must either be stupid or lazy. My recommendation is to download the CD for free from a file-sharing service and get all the right songs.
B0007P3582|1.0|This album in my opinion is garbage lyrically, however if you are the person that is more for the commercial beats then this will seem a fairly decent album, not a suprise as 50 cent works with some of the best producers out there. 50 cent has in the past had some good material. get rich or die Trying still not the best lyrical content but was quite a good album with some great tracks. And the power of the dollar, prolly his best album which is actually slept on alot.  <br /> <br />So basically if u hav heard and liked anysong on this album u will probablly enjoy the whole album cz its relatively the same.  If you didnt enjoy a song u heard of this album or if u hope to hear sum gd lyrics on it think again. dont waste ur money on it.
0062502182|4.0|I read The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho for a ninth grade reading project. It was recommended to me by my English teacher. I started to read this book and was not really liking it. After about the first fifty pages I started to like it. It really made me think about my life dream and it makes me want it to come true.This really makes you think about what you want to do with your life. I do not know if everyone would like it but I sure did. I enjoy reading books about adventure and this was about the adventure of a boy trying to make his life dream come true. The adventures that he went on were a little surprising.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Like many of you, I felt indifference on first listen to this new CD by one of my favorite artists.  But I know well enough now, after feeling the same about the last three releases, to just sit back and wait... and, sure enough, I have found myself turning this on every day, more than once a day, and loving it after all.  I think, in a world of downloads and one hit wonders, Enya is the last of the \\"album artists\\" and knows it.  Her CDs feel almost like symphonies where it's not advisable to skip around tracks; it's like one long movement and you should just hit \\"Play\\" and let the journey begin.  What first felt like droning now fits right into the whole piece like a nice dream.  Maybe nothing new but still beautiful -- and, let's face it, what do we want, \\"The Enya Disco Album?\\"  We all know we will get MUCH more mileage from this beautiful music than virtually any other CD we will buy this year.  A true artist.
B00005JO1P|4.0|I grew up listening to Johnny Cash - not because I was a fan, but because my Dad listened to it all the time, so it was always playing in the house.  Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did a wonderful job portraying Johnny Cash and June Carter.  I think Joaquin Phoenix is just a terrific actor, and Reese Witherspoon really impressed me with this role (I never liked any of her other movie performances).  This movie was enjoyable and I'm really glad I went to see it.  Having said that, I didn't walk away feeling like it was this AWESOME movie.  It sort of had a \\"formula\\" feel to it, I guess.  I did enjoy this more than Ray, but I suspect it's because I'm more familiar with Johnny Cash than I am with Ray Charles, and I'm a bigger fan of Phoenix than I am of Jamie Foxx.  All in all, this was a good movie.  I wish there was a little more singing, but I still enjoyed it.
B0000028VT|5.0|Music Box was Mariah's third studio album after her eponymous debut and her sophomore Emotions. Music Box opened Mariah up to the worldwide market and made her even of a bigger star in the US. This album contains two of her biggest songs, Dreamlover and Hero. Music Box sold approximately 25 million copies worldwide. This album is thought to be ballad infested but it has some groovy numbers to add that extra kick to it. I think Mariah Carey is a genius, her voice is amazing, a five octave range but when she isn't singing high she lulls beautifully in her lower register. Music Box immediately connected with me, the up-lifting and powerful messages and superb production were the main factors of my affection.<br /><br />This is a classy RnB album, really well polished production. I feel like Mariah Carey's music is so much different from any other RnB artist. I don't know really what it is but there is something that pulls you in. She is magical and mysterious.<br />I also really love the positive messages and how on this album (unlike later albums) she is mature and not overtly sexual in any way, there is no sex kitten like noises and breathy vocals just straight up sophistication. Sophistication is I guess what I look for in albums now but I also look for magic, genius and downright beauty. This album recognises and utilises these factors incredibly well.<br /><br />The No.1 hit Dreamlover is such a gorgeous track that features Carey's signature squealing over the top, I love this track. It shows off her talents and is very soulful. Hero is the reason I bought this album in the first place, I saw the video on TV recently and was immediately hooked, this is the perfect ballad. The piano is sultry and her voice is great. This song soundslike it comes off a Disney movie soundtrack.<br /><br />Anytime You Need A Friend has Mariah singing along with a phenomenal Gospel choir, this is my favourite track off the album. The chorus is UNFORGETTABLE. The title track, Music Box is a nice track with a music box! How ironic??!! Great song though. Now That I Know is just like the third song, Anytime You Need A Friend. This is a really groovy and soulful track.<br />The chorus is great, again.<br /><br />Never Forget You is a slow and gentle ballad and Mariah scores instantly with it, stunning vocals. Without You starts off nearly like Hero but it is completely different, it was a big hit in the UK. Slow and melodic. Just To Hold You Once Again does everything right. It sounds like a song from heaven and features another Gospel choir.<br /><br />I've Been Thinking About You is the albums biggest dig at hip-hop. It is another of my favourites off this album. It reminds us of what Mariah became, a sexy RnB/hip-hop queen. Track 10 is called All I've Ever Wanted. Another ballad, you may think that this is bad but Mariah never makes anything boring. Included is a bonus track, Everything Fades Away. It starts off with some superb instrumentation. Siganture Mariah, I can't get enough of her.<br /><br />Music Box may not be the world's longest CD, at just 47:28 it's enough for you to realise the true genius of Mariah. This is another of my favourite CD's. It's just so real and honest, up-front. The clarity in everything is just great as well. The songs are perfect and her voice is even better.<br /><br />Overall, Music Box has pointed Mariah in the right career path. So if you ignore her slump which every artist has, other than Bjork, you will notice her talent and flair for what she does.<br />Music Box may be the only Mariah album I own but I will now after listening to this album ditch my inhibitions and buy more of her albums.box!

B00005JO1Y|5.0|I think Peter Jackson is making Spielberg's career almost irrelevant. All Spielberg has left now are his aliens and his war survivors.
B00097DXZS|1.0|You cannot transfer music from this CD to iPod if you are using a PC. <br /> <br />That alone is enough to turn me off, since that is the only way I listen to music these days.  Sorry Santana, I'm not interested enough to even bother although I've been a fan for MANY years.  And Sony, well, you confirmed that for this consumer, you just ceased to exist.  You installed software on my PC without telling me what it would do, and without informed consent.  Your rootkit technology has proven to be very dangerous for consumers, seriously compromising PC security.  I currently don't own anything made by Sony, and that is the way it will stay.
B000021XS0|5.0|Dream Theater's 5th album, Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From a Memory, is a masterpiece. Telling the story of love and heartbreak, life and death through the lyrics, and the script-style booklet, this quintet have pulled off something most bands dream about. The music is fast and driving, even at it's slowest moments, drawing vivid pictures of the action time and time again. This is the pinicle of a well-developed concept album, playing with the listeners emotions, and their yearn to know the truth. And to this day, I still have yet to find music that has made me jump out of my chair at the climax of the story, yelling \\"Whaaaat!\\" in disbelief. I give it 10/10.
B000021YQV|5.0|A week before 9/11, System of a Down released probably the best metal album of the decade, and for sure the best nu-metal CD ever. This was their sophomore effort \\"Toxicity\\". It contained 14 songs in total (and a mysterious 15th hidden track), which were all instant classics. Some radio hits included \\"Chop Suey!\\", \\"Toxicity\\", \\"Deer Dance\\" and \\"Aerials\\". But besides these classics (these four were actually the best) were the best compilation of songs ever slapped together. <br /> <br />System of a Down's sound has always been loud, in your face screaming. But this is not Slipknot screaming. This is more like melodic screaming, and when lead singer Serj Tankian is not screaming, like in \\"Aerials\\", it sounds great. Guitarist, backup singer and song writer Daron Malakian is one of the best guitarists today. His riffs are amazing. Simply put. Bass player Shavo is also superb, and even though you don't hear it that much, it is still a bonus when you do. <br /> <br />And the drummer, John Dolmayan. In my opinion, he is the best drummer in modern rock. Ask any drummer who their idol is, and they will say his name. Listen to \\"Toxicity\\" to see what I mean. Put these four guys together along with their strong political views of religion, war, bombs and anything else wrong with America and you got four Armenian artists called System of a Down. <br /> <br />As for the album, everything that has to be said has been said. \\"Prison Song\\", \\"Needles\\", \\"Deer Dance\\", \\"Toxicity\\", \\"Chop Suey!\\" and \\"Aerials\\" are the best songs there. \\"Chop Suey! may be the best song ever made. The light beginning turning into the head banging makes it extremely fun to go crazy with. \\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Deer Dance\\" are superb. \\"Prison Song\\", \\"Aerials\\" and \\"Needles\\" are also the biggest highlights of the albums. Obviously the strong political views are seen in this album <br /> <br />The other songs are not as great, but they still kick ass. Songs like \\"Physco\\", \\"Forest\\", \\"Science\\", \\"X\\" and \\"Atwa\\" makes the album what it is. Put this together and you got the best modern rock album of the decade. If you haven't picked this up, you can get it cheap and it is worth every single penny. You will be hooked for the rest of your life because it is that good. If you are in the music store, pick up all of System of a Down's albums, because they are just as good. Forget the bad reviews, there is no way you can give this CD below 5 stars. <br />
B000777J2S|1.0|I literally spent half of the time it took listening to this album, working out whether or not it was a practical joke or not. <br /> <br />After deeming my conundrum to the trash can, I listened a little longer. <br /> <br />Still no luck. <br /> <br />Although, it did give me flashbacks to the RSA where my Auntie Joan sang karaoke after smoking three packs and downing the biggest bottle of sherry they could give her. <br /> <br />So, I think I'll take a simple approach to properly reviewing this album. <br /> <br />This album - hurts, and not in a good way.  Bad noise.  BAD.
B000001F7R|5.0|Yes, I admit it - I love Pyromania and High n' dry. In fact I totally wore out my vinyl copy of Pyromania and was glad when CD's finally came out. But, On through the night is the best - I never get tired of it. It's such an under rated album, even the band don't like talking about it - especially the video's. That's ok, because I don't listen to music based on the video's. If I did that, I would have never purchased and listened to \\"Until it sleeps\\" by Metallica. Yuck! On through the night is a head banging, butt-kicking, non-stop rock music experience that few can match.
B00005JNZJ|5.0|This movie is only for people who (a) like thoughtful Sci-Fi, (b) enjoy new & creative theatrical styles, and (c) prefer edgy flicks to more traditional formulaic movies. <br /> <br />To compare it to X-men is to compare John Grisham to Umberto Eco. A different ballgame completely. <br /> <br />Two recent favorites in the Sci-Fi genre include I-Robot & Minority Report, but Aeon Flux is definately a step up. Those movies are visually interesting with good plots, but they still follow a fairly bland formula: the good (male) cop falls from grace, lots of action, then it's all resolved nicely in 90 minutes. <br /> <br />Aeon Flux starts out as a \\"bad girl\\", part of a resistance movement. She then betrays her friends, as a complex mystery slowly unravels. <br /> <br />It doesn't follow a formula, it makes some bold decisions, and I applaud everything about this film. But it's not for everybody. When I was in the theater, I saw all the 50-something white men whispering to their wives, \\"What's going on???\\". And I saw all the 18-35 year-olds (MTV generation) completely engrossed. <br /> <br />After 15 minutes of this movie, I was wondering to myself how such a movie could have been made in today's conservative culture. It was so fresh & exciting, with new ideas around every corner. Science Fiction is extremely difficult to bring to the big screne: in addition to building characters and a story, you have to build the entire world & new rules of reality. And you have a limited amount of time to do it. <br /> <br />This film succeeded. It provides a counter-example to the unimaginative, uncreative films of today's Hollywood. Whether you enjoyed it or not, you have to agree that it was an extremely unique and creative theatrical experience. It's something Stanley Kubrick & Isaac Asimov would probably enjoy. I, for one, want to see more movies like this one!
0380789035|5.0|I've plowed through this book once already and am now nearly through my second reading.  This book, in my opinion, is one of the best pieces of fiction written in the last ten years, fantasy or otherwise.  While respecting the opinions of other reviewers, I want to address some of the criticisms levelled at the work in hopes of tipping the balance in the minds of perspective readers.<br /><br />First, many reviewers have cited the lack of structure and cohesiveness in the book.  Other reviewers find problems with pacing.  I think these critical impulses arise because we've all been weened on traditional classical formulae and forms of literature which adhere to the rules of conflict and resolution, rising action, climax and denouement.  While in broad outlines American Gods does follow this course, he novel, like life, takes a leisurely, meandering path.  Though my reading of the reviews hasn't been exhaustive, I'm assuming that a lot of people take exception to the bathos of the Wisconsin sequences.  I think these scenes, however, play a very necessary role in highlighting the divine, supernatural elements in the story.  In other passages, too, the seemingly superluous exposition contributes to the distinctly American ambiance of the novel.  Readers are well-rewarded for pressing on through the few bare patches (which in my view consist mostly of the unrelated, though interesting, \\"Coming to America\\" bits).<br /><br />Gaiman has been classified as a postmodern author.  As such, we must expect his work to fly in the face of established tradition.  The protagonist Shadow is a perfect example.  As his name suggests, this character begins as a sort of tabula rasa, who, like the reader, experiences the wonders along his journey in a fairly passive way.  As the novel progresses, however, this Brechtian figure gives way to a very human Shadow, a true hero in many, but not all, senses of the world.  Shadow finds his path in this labyrinthine postmodern world, just as each reader draws his or her own conclusions from the work.<br /><br />The book asks questions of belief and practice, of joy and pain, of life and death.  It provides few answers.  While a casual reader will find lots to like about American Gods, one can read this effort at deeper levels of interpretation, a task facilitated in part by the multifaceted nature of the gods who take center stage.  For instance, it is tempting to come away from American Gods with a cynical view of faith and deity, but the complexity of this book's tapestry prevents such black-and-white conclusions.  Anyone who takes an interest in these questions--that is, all but the most superficial reader--will find many gems in Gaiman's magnum opus.ach reader draws his or her own conclusions from the work. <br /> <br />The book asks questions of belief and practice, of joy and pain, of life and death.

B000BJS4SU|5.0|John Mayer had become famous for sweet little ballads -- no doubt a product of corporate record executives.  It is nice to see a telented young musician use his new found fame o break away from mind numbing junk and explore ond fashioned rock & roll.  There's nowhere to hide when all you have is a guitar, bass and drum kit -- LIVE.  Try! is reminiscent of Hendrix, old Clapton and Stevie Ray.  It is the best album I've bought in a very long time.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|All I can say to those who are considering buying this movie, give it a chance. It will defintely surprise you. I have always been a fan of Joss Whedon, since the beginning of the Buffy Verse. When I heard about Firefly the Series, I was curious for several reasions. I knew it was going to be different from Whedon's huge successes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. I knew that it was by Joss Whedon, who is a genius in his own right. I knew I could expect witty, outrageous humor, I knew I could expect depth in the characters and story lines. <br /> <br />I got everything I expected but what I did not expect was how deeply I would fall in love with the short lived series. It was nothing like Buffy or Angel, it was more. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge, dead hard fan of Buffy and Angel but Firefly is in a realm all its own.  <br /> <br />The characters are amazing, the stories... even more so. <br /> <br />I was BEYOND excited for the release of the movie, FINALLY after the show was cancelled so hastily, was it coming back to the screen and the BIG screen no less.  <br /> <br />I went the day after opening day, I sat through the movie, smiling as wide as any other Browncoat out there. This movie was awesome.It is by far one of my favorite movies of the year. It had action, that witty humor we all love and depth in the story and with the characters. I laughed, I cried, I yelled (look behind you! type stuff), I was TOTALLY into this movie. I was beyond happy. <br /> <br />I found my serenity in Serenity.... :)
B000A6T1KE|2.0|Disappointing doesn't even begin to describe how upset this movie made me feel.  I have watched every Star Trek movie and think this one is the second-to-worst one ever (the worst being Insurrection).  I was anxiously awaiting it's release.  However, upon seeing it, I wished I could erase it from memory.  Although it started off with more of a plot than some of the past films in the series, it quickly unravels into a sci-fi mess.  I kept thinking there were so many ways they could have enhanced the plot or even given the movie goers a surprise twist of an ending (especially with Picard's clone!) but it was boringly predictable.  I was also upset that a regular character was going to be killed off.  Riker gets married at the beginning of the film and then finds himself in dangerous situations throughout much of the rest of the story so you are start to believe that he will be the one to bite the dust.  He's not. That is the only \\"twist\\" in the entire film.  Add to that the fact that this film is very dark - literally.  Lots of shots in dark rooms, underground spaces, dimly lit space craft, etc. and it feels gloomy.  At least with most of the other Trek films there was always a sense of hope at the end of the movies.  Not so with this one.
B000AADYYO|5.0|I read the most honest,lowest rated reviews to check if my perspective was mistaken. They did not change my mind. <br /> <br />Never the less, I am sure that the death metal vocals would concern some people like myself who were wary when hearing they brought the death metal vocals back. <br /> <br />Unlike death metal, or growling vocals in other bands, or their other works, these vocals add to the dimension of this CD when they combined with the normal singing vocals in the symphonic music.  <br /> <br />This combined with the great compositions and great production makes this an influencial recording. <br /> <br />By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves, With those who are not the most mature, the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.  <br /> <br />Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews
0792163710|5.0|Once in a while, a genuis film director, more particularly Mr. George Stevens of James Dean/Jett Rink \\"Giant\\" fame, comes along to edify a proverbial problem!..What to do about the resident bully, who believes might makes right?..Bullies and their buddies, often change the rules to suit themselves, and in a perverse way, impede the progression of culture and evolution!..In this epic, manifest destiny required the West be tamed and settled, meaning open range-land become permanently fenced in, modifying the existing socio-economic structure..Whereas before, the free-rangers were the undisputed ruling class, the immigrant settlers become an unwelcomed addition, like ticks on a dog, to a rapidly changing landscape..Cattle and sheep, like ranchers and \\"sod-busters\\", were deemed hopelessly incompatible!..Shane, portrayed so eloquently and understated by the real-life alcoholic, and diminuitive 5 foot five inch Alan Ladd, as the buck-skinned, nomadic, white knight, rides into the Valley at the propitious moment of truth, though he was presumably, a permanently dry-docked gunslinger..Circumstances dictated otherwise, and Shane becomes the heir protector of the plain folks, that believe their destiny is to scratch out a living farming, a concept anathemic and unmanly to the rogue cowboys!..The Range Gang pull out all the usual dirty tricks and tactics, to ethnically cleanse the Valley from the fey, agrarian interlopers..The straw boss of the cattlemen, Ryker, imports Jack Palance, \\"Wilson\\", the mercenary gunfighter out of Cheyenne to clean house, meaning Shane must then step-up by default, as a matter of principle, to protect the lambs from the wolves!..Shane is motivated in large part by his feelings for the wife of the pioneer family that took him in..But, like the noble knight that he is, would never cross that unholy river, but instead do the more chivalrous calling of the Knight order, and sacrifice his personal feelings for the greater good of the village!..Shane rides into town alone to square-off with Wilson in an apocalyptic showdown, and ominously acknowledges to Ryker, \\"your kind of days are over\\"..He kills Ryker and Wilson reluctantly, in a fast draw, and realizes he's gotta mount up, telling Joey, the adolescent protagonist in the story, \\"In the end Joey, you must be what you are!\\"..And Shane rides out, as mysteriously as he rode in!..And Joey is left to plead, \\"Shane, Shane, come back, we love you, Mother loves you\\"!..And natural order is heroically restored to the Valley, by a man who really had no dog in that fight to start with?..Ironic?..See \\"Shane\\" immediately!..The cinematography, and backdrop of The Grand Tetons are breathtaking, and this Western \\"Greek Fable\\" by Mr. George Stevens, is on par with any and all of the more reknowned John Ford masterpieces!
B00005V1B1|5.0|Normally when you think of Progressive Rock, you think of three bands. Yes, Genesis, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer.  <br />I, for one, have never liked any of these three, so where am I to turn to satisfy my Prog tooth? The answer is Camel.  <br />Every track on here is great. The music is complex, incorporating many changes in meter aand tempo, not overlwhelmingly so. I think far to many prog bands put too much focus on complexity and not enough on writing good songs. That's not a problem here. Camel is great at coming up with catchy little hooks to keep the listener interested. You know they're doing something right when you find yourself humming along to a riff in 7/4 time.  <br />The instrumentation is also perfect. They balance guitars, synths and flute without any of them being overdone. I should add that the flute playing rivals that of Ian Anderson on King Crimson's debut.  <br />Finally, on the remaster you get a full half hour of bonus material, all of which is great. Ok, so the extra version of Lady Fantasy is almost the same as on the album, but it's a good enough song that I don't care.
B000005AYM|5.0|I bought this cd when it first came out, fell in love with the soulful beats and amazing vocals of Ms. Badu instantly. <br />Still to this day, I am pullin this cd out, lighting candles and incense and singin along anyday of the week. She is a great artist.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avrils the best! And i hope one day all the haters out there will realise that no one that likes Avril gives a damn what they think, their just so pathetic and have nothing better to do then try take down someone whose living their dream just because they dont like their music...get a life. <br /> <br /> <br />I first got into Avril when i won some merch off the radio and have been obbsessed ever since. this was all the way back in 2002 and im still as big of a fan as ever which just shows that avril is here for good! ^^
B00082IJ08|4.0|I had no expectations when I bought this cd. Afterall, every album they put out is different. They are all brilliant musicians. I like three or four of the songs on the whole cd. Don't be fooled by the two hits on the radio now. If you are expecting an album full of music like that, you will be disappointed. <br />But if you approach this cd with an open mind and a taste of a wide variety of music, you will appreciate it. <br />For me, honestly, it won't come out of my music collection often. Not as often as their previous albums.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Like most of the people who reviwed this album, I too am the biggest Avril fan! This album is the highlight of my life. Avrils vocals are the best, their clear, beautiful and unique. Plus shes hot! I think her songwriting will only get better and better and I cant wait to hear new stuff from her.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This movie will easily become one the greatest if not the greatest movie ever made.Natalie Portman's and Jean Reno's acting in Leon are beyond superlatives. Acting at this level really blurs fiction with reality; Mathilda and Leon in this film where no longer acting but really living it.    Rating this masterpiece using other great movies as a yardstick is like trying to compare Einstein's equations on General Relativity to an accountant's meaningless columns of numbers. They are simply not in the same universe.
0812548094|3.0|For an author that claims he doesn't write fantasy, this is a true fantasy series. Sadly it has a recurring plot and a fairly stagnate cast of characters. The series is a decent read, just don't expect something like a Martin or Erikson level of writing.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|This album grows on you. After hundreds of times listening to the album, it is still growing to amaze me... This is no doubt one of their greatest... A classic... Perfection... (Forget about the lyrics, the music is so great) Who can write such diverse atmosphere as Judas Rising, Revolution, Hellrider and Lochness... This album is symphonic...
0380788624|2.0|Stephenson has some really good works out there, this isn't one of them. He could have made this book one of his best ever but he went into much to much detail on mathematics/etc to the detriment of the story. For a better Stephenson novel try Snow Crash.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I loved the series, I love the movie. Joss knows exactly how to draw you in, make you love his \\"family\\" and want more of them. Fox was stupid to let the series go and I hope another network picks it up because I would love to see more of the \\"family\\" on board Serenity. This movie has everything you go to the movies for.
B000001FRY|4.0|This record kills U2's last two Atomic Bomb & All That You Can't.  There's some really good stuff on this and I dig Edge's guitar playing on this.  It's just way more interesting than the current stuff they're putting out.  Gotta love I Will Follow, Stories for Boys, The Ocean, An Cat Dubh, Another Time Another Place.  You could actually classify U2 as a post-punkesque band after hearing this record.
6301174240|5.0|Michael Jackson should of focused on alot more movies, after he was crowned king of all music. There wasn't anything else to accomplish, when you're beyond the top of music. I think he should still record and make music of course, but just focus more on something new, which he wants to now, but should of started a little earlier.<br /><br />When you watch this movie, (and you're not a true mj fan) don't get distracted by the start of the show, the real movie starts a little later on,... but the best is always left for last!<br /><br />If you want to see how well Michael can really act, watch his short film Ghosts, and you'll flip out. (clue: he plays many parts in this film)<br /><br />Go MJ! ..and get back to the USA soon!
B0002OERI0|4.0|I'm a Green Day fan unlike most posers who suddenly like Green Day on the basis of this one album.  I still dig American Idiot, Jesus of Surburbia, & Holiday, but absolutely cannot stand Boulevard of Broken Dreams anymore.  Ahhhh, corporate music television excels at playing out stuff.. Overall I really do think this a good record, my fav song being Whatsername.  But I am totally disgusted w/ Green Day's new poser fanbase..I saw Green Day live in SF in 2001 and thought it was the best show I had ever seen and the crowd was punk rock, plus they played w/ a kool band (the living end).  Then again I saw them in 2004 in SF after American Idiot was released and was totally shocked at the wussy crowd in attendance, along w/ the gay bands they played w/ (new found glory, sugarcult). I'd like to see if all these new bandwagon folk can name anything off of 1,039 smooth...
B000BP86OG|3.0|a pretty good album from the darkness but ignorant people like poster \\"jeffery\\" makes darkness fans sound stupid. Jeffery, are you seriously comparing a darkness album with the legendary queen! are you serious?...wake up my man, any queen album blows this out of the water, even the weaker albums are light years better than this.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|Without doubt, the worst film I have seen in several years. <br /> <br />This film is built around approximately 9 subplots, each of which is loosely related to the theme that love takes many forms and can turn up in the most unexpected places. <br /> <br />Several of these plots are shallow, one-joke sketches excruciatingly protracted over the course of over two hours.   <br /> <br />The more involved ones are even more insulting and formulaic. It would be difficult to decide which of them was the worst, but my candidate would be the plot involving Colin Firth.  It is entirely contrived to concoct a \\"romantic\\" final scene, the details of which I will not disclose here so as not to \\"spoil\\" (if such a thing could be done for this horrendous film) the plot. But suffice it to say that the film hurls every lame cliche at the screen at the same time -- syrupy music, a contrived final scene, ethnic stereotyping, all to celebrate a \\"love\\" that, as far as the filmgoer can tell, doesn't really exist.  The film doesn't seem to care about the essence of any particular love story, as much as it does the sorts of manipulative payoff scenes that can get audiences to tear up.   <br /> <br />If one is going to feel warm and fuzzy, one needs something to feel warm and fuzzy about.  You can't just skip to the climax and expect the viewer to believe in a love that is never really shown developing in any way. <br /> <br />The subplot with Hugh Grant may be equally deplorable.  He plays the British PM, but doesn't bother to act, it's rather as though Hugh Grant himself has been installed at 10 Downing Street.  This subplot is insulting on several levels, but perhaps most because of its imbecilic take on international diplomacy.  The Americans are played as sinister rubes, on up to their lascivious President played by Billy Bob Thornton.   <br /> <br />The subplot with Keira Knightley is supposed to be moving but is instead creepy.  If you think stalking is romantic, you might like thatone. <br /> <br />The film reaches for the lowest common denominator at every turn, for a length of over two hours.  Awful stuff.  I'm a lover of good romantic comedies, but trust me, this is definitely not one of them.  It's a cliche factory, from start to finish; by the middle, I felt insulted.  By the end, I was incensed. <br /> <br />Stay away!
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I echo so many of the thoughts expressed by others who've opined.  However, I think it's the Rufus Wainwright song \\"The Maker Makes\\" that is the highlight of the album.  As much as I love Emmylou Harris's art, her song doesn't capture the heartache that ultimately colors the film.  Wainwright's mournful dirge is perfect for this story of unrequited love. <br /> <br />I'd love it if \\"The Maker Makes\\" is the song nominated from this movie -- and better yet, Wainwright's performance could possibly be one of the highlights of an Oscar telecast. <br /> <br />Simply put, I can't get the song out of my mind.
B000002KOO|5.0|This is one of the great classics of the late 60's era.  It's a very unusual blend of blues and other musical genres.  The coda to \\"Oh Well\\" reminds one very much of the Ennio Morricone score for \\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\\" in places.  \\"Searching For Madge\\" is the greatest one chord boogie vamp I think I've ever heard, Kirwan and Green play furiously while Fleetwood and McVie keep hammering away back there.  I'm not sure why they put the bizarre breaks in the middle of this jam but it works I guess.  I'm sure I heard Miles Davis borrow this jam structure on one of his live Lps back in the day, maybe Live at the Fillmore?<br /><br />There is only one track that I really don't care for... Actually, I hate it.  Danny Kirwan's \\"When You Say\\" and its highly imaginative \\"la la la la la la la la la la la la\\" (and so on, complete with counter-point harmony voice) lyric is probably being used in those secret CIA detention centers in Europe where the \\"terrorists\\" are interrogated.  Listening to the entire tune is torture enough to make anyone start talking.  The melody is actually quite sophisticated but the track is actually very annoying because of those stupid lyrics (or lack thereof).  What was this guy thinking?<br /><br />\\"Then Play On\\" is just so great (musically) that I have to pick up the trio of \\"Live at the Boston Tea Party\\" CDs.<br /><br />This AAD remaster is 20 years old. Can you say Hisssssssssss. 1/2 star only for this remaster.  No, wait... Five turkeys for this remaster. It is God awful by today's standards.<br /><br />It is absolutely criminal that the folks at Warner Bros/Reprise have not remastered this session, added outtakes for bonus tracks, and re-released it with a booklet of notes and photos.  I'm sure they could get away with a $24.95 price tag if they would get off the dime.<br /><br />Laa-laaa-laaaaaaaaaa-la-la-laaa-la-la-laaaa
B000BNI90O|5.0|This is a LOTR fan's dream come true! Without the \\"distraction\\" of the stunning visuals and terrific acting of the films, you can now focus on the depth and complexity of every note of Howard Shore's glorious music for the first film. The reviewer at soundtracks.com says it all and more when he raves at length about the quality of this set of CDs and DVD. The audio DVD is a huge plus, and the entire set is well worth the asking price. Let's just hope we don't have to wait a year for the Two Towers complete music--this is just too good to wait for. It's the perfect Yule gift for any Rings fan--too bad it's so difficult to find in retail outlets. Order it now!!! <br />
B00005JMXX|4.0|You should go see \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" because it is full of intensity and because of its realistic scenes.  However if you were someone who doesn't believe in the world ending I wouldn't go so this. <br />I watched this movie on November 22 of 2005 at home by myself.  It was 2 hrs. and 4 minutes with a PG-13 rating and was directed by Roland Emmerich.  I have also watched this in previous times with my family.  It was definitely different watching it the second time because you already know the whole story but since it is such a wonderful movie with breathe taking visual effects you still focus in on it.  My family also thought it was a great movie.   <br />This movie received great reviews.  Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-times thought that the movie was silly but at the same time was very intrigued with the special effects.  That is one of the strengths that I also found fascinating in the movie and how real they made each scene seem.  They also had great actors and actresses that made the movie full of feelings.  You can really tell that the actors were feeling the scenes.  They all gave a wonderful performance and they all came together for a marvelous performance. <br />It's full of excitement and keeps you wanting more at the end.  They had it made so realistic that it makes you think what if it happened on this time frame that you are living in now.  The story is developed from researchers in the middle of a huge glacier trying to gather information and with the start of the tragedies.  The catastrophes happen right after the other but you never know what it's going to be next; whether it'll be a huge earth wake or just everyone dying and the world ending.  This movie was very scary in its own way because it showed what would happen in the feature and how anything can happen in an instant.  If you were someone who was even afraid of dying would probably pee your pants if you watched this movie.  I think people with phobias of that sort would not sleep for days having nightmares of the situations in the movie. <br /> They had great special affects using CGI.  Their scenes looked so real you wouldn't think it was done on a computer.  All the weather conditions looked like it took time and was developed greatly.  I thought that the scenes of Los Angeles and New York were the best.  This movie was filled with great images which made it look so realistic. <br />I didn't know that so much was involved in our world.  How we actually have real researchers out there trying to keep up with matter like this that would affect our world.  This movie showed that once there is a problem then it must be announced to leaders around the world.  This movie makes you think what if this happened tomorrow. <br /> Never take your life for granted because anything can happen tomorrow.  Always be prepared and be smart about situations.  Watch this movie because it sure will make you think about what revolves around you.  I recommend this movie to be watched it is worth your money.
B00004W3L3|5.0|I still listen to the cassette of this album (one of maybe 4-5 cassettes I still listen to) and it is a flawless, powerful and emotional album from start to finish.  I vividly remember seeing Marillion open for Rush when this album came out. Kayleigh was a single on the radio but I knew nothing else about them. They played the songs from Misplaced Childhood in order without a pause and when it was over the audience couldn't believe it.  No one wanted them to stop.  Rush paled by comparison (and I'm a Rush fan...).  Get this one (I'm finally replacing my cassette with this CD.  I just hope they remastered it well.)
B000BOH8XW|2.0|Aside from those horrid Nike commercials that made me laugh and want to kill her at the same time, ive been hoping to like her follow up to Laundry Service. this One had such promise. Rick Ruben producing, a rock approach..  but it just comes off a bit forced. And listening to her theological critiques is like Taking Ricky Martin seriously as an artist... c'mon. Pink Floyd, you're not. The songs just aren't that good. I got bored first listen and was really disappointed. I like Laundry Service a lot and her first two in spanish are pretty damn good too. But maybe she's trying to hard to appeal as a rock act, i dunno. Or just needs to write better songs. I guess i should have guessed from these really cheesy record covers on the \\"Oral\\" series.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|many people have complained that this movie is too dark and doesn't have anything positive to offer. but that's the hard truth of life. so many people who've been emotionally and psychologically ravaged in life by unforunate incidents find it very difficult to get over the trauma of such experience(s). the lesson in the movie is not for people like them, but for others to understand their difficulties and treat/help them with compassion.    it is all very well to point to the hope and promise of shawshank redemption. but such happens in very rare circumstances to very rare people - often only in movies. the hard truth is most normal people wilt under such traumatic experiences. the makers of the movie are to be complimented for bravely tackling such issues especially in this age of industrial \\"feel good\\" propoganda.    the movie does not try to explain away jimmy's murder of dave. rather such is the view of the wife who has to justify to herself of her husband's non-guilt and reconcile her life with the murder. jimmy accepts his guilt and in the final scene shrugs his helplessness against the situation. but he has to go on because there are so many who are dependent on him, including the families of his victims.    though sean penn is fantastic in his role as the grieving father who seeks the truth of his daughter's death and revenge, it is tim robbins and the woman who acts as his wife who have done their highly complex roles to perfection.    great movie this - marks the entry of clint eastwood as a director capable of handling such serious subjects with depth and subtlety.
0345457684|5.0|What a relief. Instead of yet another SF story unnecessarily bloated to a three-volume sinecure, Richard Morgan winds his story tightly and engagingly. And in doing so, he slips in some interesting hard SF notions to ponder without laying it on thickly. For this, I and thousands of others will eagerly await his next story.
0553801503|5.0|I don't understand why so many readers are so criticists with this book. Yes, there is no climax at the end of the story, but this is due at the actual situation in Westeros: the war is over and the crows (schemers, polititians) are feasting. This book is setting the plot for the next three books so you have to wait for the end of the saga to judge this one correctly. I don't think Martin is trying to milk his fans, because he waited 5 years before realising \\"Feast\\" he found hard to write this one. In any case, the book is really well written and the story is still interesting as the characters. Martin is still the best fantasy writer of the last two decades!
B00005JO1Y|4.0|Peter Jackson seems to have a habit of keeping me up late, as this is the second time I have gone to see a premiere at Midnight. Now whereas I was not quite as enthralled as I was with ROTK, this is still a stunning spectacle, even if 3hours is bit of a marathon.<br /><br />The set design, and base for the story are that of the 1933 original flick, set in depression hit New York, and starring Jack Black as a zealous (to say the least) film producer. We find him running from his financial backers after they decide to pull the plug, and charming and bribing his way onto a ship bound for \\"Skull Island\\" to make his masterpiece. Along the way he picks up struggling stage artist Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow, and manages to delay Adrian Brody (as screen writer Jack Driscoll) on board long enough to not only avoid paying him, but getting him to finish the movie script he intends to shoot. I'm going to end the synopsis here, as too many reviews have gone into way too much detail (spoilers included) already, and most people know the original anyway (this one albeit mirroring that only loosely).<br /><br />Once on the island we meet Kong, and as well as a whole host of Weta SfX departments creations in some great scenes, although some are rather silly it seems.<br /><br />The picture is not exceptional, but from the point of view of enterntainment it's great. Visually stunning, and very fast paced after thirty minutes or so, you will laugh, jump, and even squirm at many of the scenes. The acting is top notch as well, and Jackson still it seems has a knack in the Editors chair as well. It was nice to see Andy Sirkis in a support role, as well as many other recognisable faces. A lot of people have bemoaned the overloaded CGI, but this IS entertainment folks - if they had had that kind of technology in 1933, they would have used it, trust me. My only real complaint is the running time, this is NOT LOTR, and didn't need to be 3 hours long,(even the restored original is only 104 mins) and sometimes too much padding gets in the way - case in point is the ending, which is especially drawn out. All that said, go see it for yourself - it WILL be one of the most talked about films of the holidays, and sure to rake it in big at the box office, so treat yourself and see what we're all talking about. Great fun, a bit too scary for younger viewers, but overall a Very Good (if not quite Great) remake brought up to date.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|Not sure what most of these people have been smoking including Jedd Beaudoin, but this album is great from the first song to the 15th.  Yes, they have a different sound and have added some synth to their songs, but this is called progression. <br /> <br />This albums offers a lot of variety and is worth listening to over and over again.  As for whether this will be a commercial hit or not doesn't mean anything anymore.  In a day were Jessica and Ashlee Simpson, boy band crap and wannabe rappers top the chats, I would hope that KoRn would never appeal to this audience!!! <br /> <br />If you like any of the previous KoRn albums, this is a must to add to your collection.  Make sure you pick up the dual disk release to get: <br /> <br />The Deluxe Edition includes a bonus disc featuring: <br />- Three unreleased studio bonus tracks,  <br />- Two remixes of Twisted Transistor,  <br />- Videos of \\"Twisted Transistor\\" and \\"Hypocrites\\" shot live in Moscow, 2005. <br /> <br />Free one-year membership to the KoRn BSC Online Fan Club featuring:  <br />- Access to exclusive behind-the-scenes media content  <br />- KoRn community membership with personal home page and blog  <br />- Pre-sale ticket access for upcoming KoRn concerts.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|There isn't much left to be said about how good this album is.  Its position in the rock pantheon is well confirmed and the other reviewers have summed it up well.<br /><br />This set would be worth the cash if the Hammersmith Odeon 1975 DVD were the only thing in it.  Its an absolutely incredible performance.  And the audio quality is fantastic.  I wish rock and roll were this fun and emotional today.  Buy it if you are a fan of Bruce or a fan of kick back stripped down rock and roll classics.....
B000005JKH|4.0|This era of Tangerine Dream (TD) was just great. The Virgin Years were truly a great period for TD. For me it deals with space and landscape. It's so close to repetitive music that would come much later. It's also the one group that used rythm to structure these flying melodies. You could fly with them and end up with more in the end. You can't say that for too many of these Electronic groups. After that period they would go on with this ambient music that wasn't up to the same standards. It seems they are back (with other musicians of course) with the same kind of concept. Great! They were an important link on the electronic scene. A great album! A great period!
B0009R1T7M|2.0|you must be american to like this stuff. probably, obviously. there is too lot of everything inside, this is too big, too full. if you like things like sigur ros, keep aside.
B000BGH22W|4.0|With the \\"change\\" in Book IV, the movie soundtrack has changed its definition as well.  <br /> <br />The story plot in Book IV contains both darker and lighter material, thus further defines the characters with depth and maturity. The music does the same. Unlike the underscore from \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" -- which often recycled the same motive on many occasions -- the beginning theme for \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" has become darker, and rest of the underscoring music contains differentiated characters to accommodate the \\"change\\" and further-definition of the story plot. With the maturity of Harry, you will also hear the maturity of the music -- cute crush, passion, fear, uncertainty, and anticipation of what's to come. If you are a fan of the Harry Potter movies, this soundtrack will be great to have. <br /> <br />Two other comments: <br />1) The last three tracks are from the rock singer singing in ball scene. It has a taste of teenager/high school memories. <br />2) The beginning of the theme may sound a bit like the theme for other grand hero movies like \\"Batman\\" or \\"The Matrix.\\" Nevertheless, it sounds quite good.
B0006L16N8|5.0|With X&Y, Coldplay have replicated the feat they accomplished on A Rush of Blood to the Head--a brilliant (and distinct) opening tracklist. \\"Speed of Sound\\" and \\"Low\\" carry us through the middle, while the album ends on two high notes: \\"Twisted Logic\\" is a pounding number with some real attitude, while the reflective, Cash-esque \\"Til Kingdom Come\\" rings true in every way.
B000000HU1|1.0|The music is fine. <br /> <br />The problem is that it does not play in my car stereo or my computer.  It is not even strictly speaking a \\"compact disc\\", which is a trademark that this product is not eligible to use.  It bears EMI's \\"Copy Controlled\\" logo instead. <br /> <br />Due to the fact this product may not play in many players, I would not under any circumstances recommend it to anybody.
B00006CJOY|5.0|The songs are not carbon copies of thier vinyl originals but many of them are better and the instrumentation is amazing on this disc.  <br /> <br />Yes, it's mostly at one tempo but that one is fast. Very addictive if you are ready to hear something that you don't necessarily recognize. The best live album I have ever heard. Try not to listen in a car as this album causes repetitive swerves and generally too happy behavior for driving.
B000002UDB|5.0|As much as I love Sgt Pepper, the White Album and Abbey Road, I must say this is my favourite Beatles Album. This is the album at the height of the Beatles pyschedelic period. It contains 10, in my opinion, 10 \\"5 Star\\" tracks with Paul's \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" lacking behind. <br /> <br />Magical Mystery Tour - Great Title track gives a great feeling of what is to come. I rank it higher than Sgt Peppers title track. Great Groove. 9/10 <br /> <br />The Fool on the Hill - Paul's best song on this album. Superb experimentation with unusual instruments. I'm not fantastic when it comes to determining instruments but I'm pretty sure it's a flute! (correct me if I'm wrong) Great vocals. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Flying - Pyschedelic instrumental. Experimentation is lovely here and great to \\"chillax\\" to. 9/10 <br /> <br />Blue Jay Way - Not the greatest but again great pyschedelic feel and cool drumming from Ringo here. Freaky Vocals. 8/10 <br /> <br />Your Mother Should Know - Worst track on the album. Indeed one of \\"Paul's Granny Songs\\". Doesn't really fit on the album. I'm thinking perhaps \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" should have been included in this album instead of this track. 7.5/10 (hey it's still a great song) <br /> <br />I am the Walrus - This is where the album goes from great to LEGENDARY! One of the best Beatles songs and one of the best songs ever, the peak of pyschedelia. Think of the lyrical genius John Lennon when you hear this song, this is his peak. easily 10/10 <br /> <br />Hello Goodbye - Catchy Lyrics, great groove, I love the guitar riff and the lyrics after the second verse. FARRRRRBULOUS. 9/10 (bit stale after a while) <br /> <br />Strawberry Fields - My second favourite track here. This is immoratal John Lennon. Lovely Vocals. This is about an orphanage where Lennon grew up, his Aunt Mimi didn't approve of him hanging around the children there (listen to the lyrics carefully and you will develop an understanding of the track. 10/10 <br /> <br />Penny Lane - All you have to do is listen to this and if you enjoy good music you will lave it. 10/10 <br /> <br />Baby Your A Rich Man - Pyschedelia starts to come back here. This isn't a classic but still a great groove. 9/10 <br /> <br />All You Need Is Love - Classic. What else can you say? 9.9/10 (just can't give it a 10 compared to xome others on this album) <br /> <br />If you buy a Beatles Album this Christmas, buy this one. Truly, fantastic and if you wana trip out to something try this. I feel priveliged to be alive to hear this album. YOU SHOULD BE TOO <br /> <br />Sam, 14 <br />Wellington, NZ
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I am fairly new getting started in period movies and I am having a ball with such wonderful movies out there..I have not seen them all & I thought that Wifes & Daughter's was so good (and still is) but last night I finished North & South and I will not ever forget it and I will cherish it as I own this wonderful movie..This movie is more dark than Wifes & Daughters but the passion & feelings that were in me while watching it and especially at the end and the train scene & through the movie can not be matched by any other fim I have ever seen.I just can not say enough for this film & hope anybody that loves excellent period films see this one as you will not be disappointed.

B000001BZT|5.0|COPPERHEAD ROAD is the best album ever by Steve Earle, blending influences from such artists as Johnny Cash, the Charlie Daniels Band, Waylon Jennings, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Willie Nelson, the Marshall Tucker Band, Tompall Glaser, the Outlaws, Billy Joe Shaver, Creedence Clearwater Revival, the Band, and the Allman  Brothers Band circa BROTHERS AND SISTERS with a touch of alternative attitude, creating the best country-rock sound this side of the 70s Southern Rock boom. The songs on side one are a loose suite based on the experiences of Vietnam veterans during and after the war, with several lines in the title track being so cautionary about the dangers of going where you shouldn't be that they inspire me to look at pictures of pretty actresses as a deterrent against hanging out on the wrong side of the city where I currently live (Kingston, NY). Earle's belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia on drug-smuggling charges was unjustly convicted makes this an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
068987474X|2.0|This is sort of like \\"The Rules\\" with a new faux-hip outfit.    In spite of the \\"Sex + the City\\" tie-in it seemed geared to women much younger than the Fab Four, say upper teens and low twenties.  Much of the material was so elementary that it would be hard to believe most women much past 25 weren't already savvy to it.    It's a difficult book to critique because it's ostensible purpose -- helping women deal with Bad Men -- is so very noble; being critical of it makes it sound like you're on the side of the Bad Guys.  Such is not the case.  Good Guys marvel at the idiocy of women seeming to spend all their time with Bad Guys.  But except for that which is self-evident (like dumping a guy who's abusive) I thought the usual mix of comfortable and familiar half-truths, shallow analysis, and outright howlers would just make things worse.    The book will appeal to female chauvinists who haven't outgrown their Cinderella Complexes.  It presents an unrealistic and warped universe where every women is a TEN (hottie, fox, etc.), while every man is a big zero.  Yes, it's very flattering to the target female reader, telling her just what she wants to hear.  I'm surprised at the extent to which women are easily seduced by such nonsense.  The anti-male bias is so pervasive it makes you wonder why a) any woman would want to have anything to do with any man; b) why the author hasn't had a sex-change operation; or c) why the author hasn't simply committed suicide.  But there are no answers to such questions.    Let's just take Rule #1 as an example.  This is the Passivity Rule: don't call a guy you're interested in, don't ask him out.  You're worth it, babe, and he should be grateful for being allowed in your presence.  There's hardly any possibility of this rule being broken since women are naturally passive and have made it clear for years, in spite of claims to wanting equality, that they don't want to initiate or pursue.  That's the man's *job*, sort of like how it used to bethe woman's job to have dinner on the table every night at 6PM.  But if you want a quart of milk do you wait for it to show up on your door step, or do you go out to the store and get what you want?    Behrendt is especially lax when it comes to detailing the downsides of the passive strategy, which he doesn't really consider.  First, it's designed perfectly to select for operators, seducers, \\"players\\", casanovas, the most sexually aggressive, pushy extroverts, etc.  So women shouldn't be surprised or complain when that's what they get.  After years of behavior training to hit on women, possibly dozens or hundreds of 'em, a man is not likely to change just because one finally says \\"yes\\".  That would be sort of like expecting a woman to stop shopping after she's bought that dress or pair of shoes she wanted.  Not gonna happen.  So be passive if you want a man who'll cheat on you.    Second, the way things work is that the men with high \\"mate value\\" (good catches), those who are 8's, 9's and 10's aren't hitting on the women who are 5's and 6's -- but the men who are 2's, 3's, and 4's are.  So women who think they're meeting a random representative sampling of men and don't recognize that their strategy is producing what are called by scientists \\"selection effects\\" think all men are unworthy of them, that there are \\"no good men\\".  (It helps even less if the woman who's a 6 thinks she's a 10...)  In other words, the passive strategy guarantees a woman always meeting men *she* won't be that into.    Third, the strategy seriously disadvantages women who aren't approximately good-looking -- i.e., the vast majority of women.  This is because it's reliance on \\"attractiveness\\", which is to say \\"physical attractiveness\\", which is to say \\"sexual attractiveness\\" puts average looking woman with many other good qualities out of the competition and never allows them to show what they've got.  Or you try and compete by being shallow and buying a lot of beauty products when you're time would be better spent reading a book or something (just not this book).    Ok, the other chapter worth a mention was the one on marriage.  As you can surmise, the way it goes is that he's just not that into you if he won't marry you.  Unless of course you're a woman who's leery of marriage; then he's the one wanting to marry and you're the one resisting.  The whole tortuous chapter ends up with Behrendt coming down firmly on the fence after doing a long tap dance trying to reconcile these opposite ways of looking at things.  He should have just said the rule is that the woman always gets her way, whatever it is, and left it at that.    This pretty well sums up the book, and one would have to be truly dense to not understand how this creates a world where no man with any self-esteem would have any interest in being into any woman at all, ever.    So the book actually adds to the problems it purports to be the solution to.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|The other day I was minding my own buisness, when some idiot came up to me singing \\"Bat Country\\". 1. Don't come up to me singing 2. Don't sing songs that suck 3. Don't think that you are cool or metal just because you listen to a sucky band that credits metal as a influence. You know what Avenged Sevenfold means? It is long for EMO. Avenged Sevenfold has some ok old stuff, but not the new stuff. The only good thing about AX7 is that the lead whiner suppports Bush. That's cool. I hope that keeps alot of you idiots that are anti-war from listening to them.  <br />Anyways, you can buy this album if you want, just keep it to yourself. So that the only mind it corrodes is your's. If you don't want to buy this album now, buy \\"...And Justice For All\\"-Metallica, \\"Reign In Blood\\"-Slayer, and \\"Shovel Headed Kill Machine\\"-Exodus. Cuz these bands (and albums) kick ass.
B0009F9O6W|5.0|Not since the King Crimson remasters by Caroline has there been this great of a re-master; not one thing is wrong with it. Liner notes now are hugely plentiful, even the packaging just makes you proud to own it again. The re-master of course sounds great, but when I say that, I mean it really sounds perfect. Perfect as in La Boheme perfect. This is one re-master that even gives the orginal LP a run for it's money.<br /><br />Best re-master of '05 by a long, long shot.
B000BMSTMS|2.0|Okay, so I've just listened to the album and I have to admit, this is pretty weak material coming from a band who garnered their fame from breaking out of mainstream rock. This album just did not seem to have the same feeling of creativity or individuality that I've come to expect from KoRn. A few tracks were decent, but most seemed very clouded and over produced. A valiant effort by a band in turmoil, but a dissapointment none the less. <br />     As for our friend Pisser. For someone who hates this band you seem to devote an unusually large amount of time reviewing their work. I find it amusing that you belittle others for being immature and naive, when your choice of vocabulary is reminicent of a pre-pubecent teen with major insecurity and detatchment issues. Excessive cursing and slander do not help to convey your opinion in an intelligent manner, and further more only serve to make you look ignorant and immature yourself. Perhaps if you learned to speak to others like an adult, you would not garner so much criticism. As for hiding behind a name, mine is Alex, I was unaware that parents named their children after bathroom fixtures these days. Truth is Pisser, no body cares whether you like the band or not. These reviews are meant to serve fans and listners who enjoy the bands music and wish to discuss it's evolution or dissolution. Unfortunately there are too many home bodied loners, like your self, with no friends or hobbies that clog these sites with your idiotic banter so that you can feel big for a moment. Rather sad in my opinion. Perhaps it would serve you better to change your name from Pisser, as it seems to me that everything out of your mouth smells like BullSh*#! -  <br />
B000A88F22|5.0|This DVD was the reason i signed up with AMAZON, i'm a huge BRITNEY fan and of course when the america release date was announced and there no australian release date scheduled, i signed up and this was the first product i purchased. I wasn't dissappointed. How underrated!!! It's such a good show, the reason there is so many negative reviews on it, is because it wasn't filmed for TV. <br /> <br />The footage is from Britney and Kevin's camcorder, they filmed it themselves, for themselves. When television networks offered them a reality show, they said no, most likely thinking they didn't need even more cameras following their every move so instead, they sold the rights to UPN to screen footage they had filmed themselves months before of the pair getting together, falling in love, getting engaged and finally, getting married. <br /> <br />So perhaps you should know, the footage is raw, unrehearsed and at times jaw dropping. You won't find \\"virgin, catholic Britney\\" here. She's growing up. I have to ask, what's the big deal that she lost her virginity before marriage? Realistically, when you think about it, Britney was a 16 girl sitting in a press interview expecting to answer questions about her debut album, and the interviewers ask her \\"Have you had sex?\\", \\"Are you a virgin?\\". Of course she said \\"No, i'm still a virgin\\". How uncomfortable and intimidated would she have felt? And of course she continued to to say that, if she admitted that she lost her virginity, she would have lost her good girl image and (back then) a lot of young female fans finding inspiration in her. She's not a bad person. Most people who thinks she is a bad person for that, are hypocrites. <br /> <br />It's a good show, you get a look inside her personal life (and no, not all the lies in the media) and if you really watch it, you can see what Britney is really like; open, caring, scared and protective. <br /> <br />Overall, yes, BRITNEY AND KEVIN: CHAOTIC is a funny, refreshing, realistic reality show. But if you're looking for a replacement for NEWLYWEDS: NICK & JESSICA, then you've come to the wrong place.
0553801503|1.0|Martin seems intent on dragging this series out as long as possible, which promises to result in it whithering on the vine.  It could be a GREAT 5 or even 6 book series, but Martin seems to be going the way of Terry Goodkind. <br /> <br />This book was full of way too much lead-up, and it ended just a half-step down the road from where it began.  It also made it clear that any conclusion to the series is miles away.  Honestly, I was disappointed that I purchased the hardcover, because this book, in hte end, just didn't go anywhere.
B000002OZY|5.0|Just a couple of corrections, really:  <br /> <br />\\"Tommy\\" was NOT the first rock opera put to record. That distinction belongs to the Pretty Things and their album \\"PF Sorrow.\\" It's certainly a less well known work, but they still beat The Who to vinyl. <br /> <br />And in the original concept album, it's Captain Walker who kills the boyfriend upon his return (he was MIA following World War I), not the other way around as in the film version. Ken Russell insisted upon changing this for his film because his pal Oliver Reed was playing the boyfriend (Frank Hobbs) and had to have a big part. Pete Townshend has said that \\"it doesn't matter\\" which character dies; however, I strongly disagree, as I'm sure most psychologists would as well. (A child is bound to be more profoundly affected by the murder of a father he's longed to know for his entire life than the death of some friend of his mum's whom he bearly knows). But for the sake of getting it right, it's the boyfriend who buys the farm in the album version and it's his parents' screaming at Tommy to deny his senses after witnessing the murder which sends him into his catatonic state.
B000001EC1|3.0|BON JOVI-CROSS ROADS: BON JOVI always amounted to the poor man's SPRINGSTEEN and as far as New Jersey rock acts go, SOUTHSIDE JOHNNY & THE ASBURY JUKES also possessed more chops and blue eyed soul power, even if they lacked BJ's movie star good looks and mass recognition. The guilty pleasure hat trick of YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME, LIVIN' ON A PRAYER, (both co-written with song doctor to the stars DESMOND CHILD) and WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE from their big-hair breakthrough album SLIPPERY WHEN WET cemented the band's crafty, radio-ready brand of \\"bubble-metal\\", goosed by JON BON JOVI's non-threatening yelp, RICHIE SAMBORA's slick six string licks, and hooks big enough to hang sombreros on. Subsequent singles BAD MEDICINE, LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME and KEEP THE FAITH milked the arena rock formula a little too thoroughly, even as the band climbed into the upper echelon of pin-up pop stars. Sure, you can hum this stuff all night long, but will you be able to respect yourself in the morning when it's still clingin' to your tongue like dry-mouth?<br /><br />RATING: THREE CANS OF MOUSSE
B00005JO1Y|3.0|Since the movie was built around the ape it's a good thing he came through for us in the end. This is truly visual film in every sense of the word.<br /><br />The actors did the best they could with the few lines they had. Casting was OK, but could have been much better, period clothes and sets looked real.<br /><br />The only reason to see this film is for the great Kong himself. When he's holding his lovely it looks pretty cheesey but when he's ripping the city apart and haulin ass around town it's worth the early movie ticket price.<br /><br />When leaving the theater I didn't hear ANYONE talking about the film, that's a bad sign. I can see why, I must admit I fell asleep several times during the movie. But why should this one be any different than most of this year's offerings?

0316096199|5.0|Alice Seebold went through a incredibly awful, traumatic experience.  She starts off the book with a brutal and painfully raw description of her attack.  I literally could only read one or two paragraphs at a time as it is very difficult to read.  That being said, I could barely read about the experience....Alice Seebold had to live through it.  But live through it she did.  An experience like that would emotionally traumatize anyone.  But the personal decisions the author makes emotionally after this experience and they way she chooses to respond to it are truly inspirational.  She is obviously an incredibly brave and courageous person.  Truly a great read.

B00005JO1Y|5.0|From the opening shots - the misery of 1930's New York City set to happy music - to the choked words \\"'Twas Beauty killed the Beast\\" uttered by Carl Denham, this is what -King Kong- was always meant to be.<br /><br />Although long at 2 hours 58 minutes, the time is needed to create the characters - even the doomed ones - and set the scene.  I refuse to reveal much more: suffice it to say that Anne Darrow [the character created by Fay Wray] is more talented when created by Naomi Watts, Jack Driscoll [Adrian Brody] more believable than \\"the 1st Mate\\" in the original, & Jack Black more maniacal as the director who*willl not* be stopped no matter ... what?!!<br /><br />& Andy Serkus is awesome ... more than believable, he's heart-wrenching as the final survivor of a doomed race of magna-gorillas, w/soul-searing eyes & body language that makes mere vocalizations seem unnecessary.  His is the gargantuan soul of this larger-than-life tale...
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Idina Menzel (playing Elphaba, the green witch) is a powerful, emotional and excellent singer. My daughter who is 12 and I found this CD to be addictive. We saw the musical and we love this CD. There are several fantastic tracks, our favorites:  Defying Gravity  As Long as you're mine  No good deed goes unpunished  Popular    You may not enjoy it as much until you have seen the musical. Once you see it, if you love the musical, you'll want the CD. Without seeing the musical, the tracks don't really seem tied together and aren't as captivating, at least on first listen.  I can't say enough about Idina Menzel's voice. Kristin Chenoweth also has a beautiful sound on this CD and compliments Idina well.   See for yourself.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|There's a part of me that feels a bit guilty proclaiming King Kong my favorite movie of 2005. After all, as a movie buff I'm supposed to favor serious dramatic pictures with important social and human messages or little independent art house movies shot on a minuscule budget. Certainly not a $200 million behemoth about a giant ape crammed with nonstop action sequences and special effects. However, the fact remains: King Kong is my favorite movie of 2005. I can be biased against big-budget movies as I'm sure a lot of movie buffs are, however what ultimately matters is not the size of the budget or number of special effects shots. Small-budget indie movies can be very bad, and big-budget Hollywood movies can be very good. What makes the difference is the passion and craftsmanship on display. The interest and love that the filmmakers have for the material and the ability to pull it off. With Peter Jackson's King Kong there is not a single frame on the screen in its 187-minute duration that lacks passion or craftsmanship. This is a very personal movie for Peter Jackson, perhaps even more personal than The Lord of the Rings. While watching the movie you can almost see nine-year-old Peter pretending to film Kong climbing the Empire State Building in his backyard. In reality, Jackson is 44 and the backyard is now a huge New Zealand movie set, however the passion is still there. King Kong is not your typical action/special effects movie. If it were, it would not even make my favorite movies list, much less top it. This is an action/special effects movie helmed by Peter Jackson. The man who made it possible for a special effects/fantasy film to sweep the Academy Awards. It should be no surprise that his latest is more than just flashy brain candy.    King Kong is a success both as epic spectacle and dramatic storytelling. Essentially it's a love story between a woman and a 25-foot ape. The fact that the woman actually has chemistry with the ape is only one of this movie's wonders. The film contains some of the most amazing sights you're likely to see on the motion picture screen, but never at the expense of drama and characterization. It has moments that are genuinely moving, for example one scene towards the end involving Ann Darrow and Kong on a frozen pond. It has moments that are frightening, such as the second act on Skull Island where Carl Denham and crew encounter any type of slimy oversized beast you could imagine. It has thrills and lots of them. The Skull Island scenes have some of the most astonishing action sequences anyone has seen. Even when the movie seems to be turning into Jurassic Park 4, Peter Jackson always manages to put something new and refreshing on the screen. He consciously avoids showing the dinosaurs in a familiar way. Each time a new dino appears on the screen, Jackson utilizes  it in a way that we've never seen before. Kong's fight with multiple T-Rexes is sure to go down in cinematic history along with the epic battle from Jackson's Return of the King. The final act of the film, in which Kong is brought captive to New York City, is as spectacular as anything on Skull Island. If you've seen the 1933 film, or even if you haven't, you know what happens but it is still an incredible, very moving finale. The whole Empire State Building sequence is just amazing.    Much will be said about the actors in King Kong. I think most everyone will agree that Naomi Watts is superb as Ann Darrow, doing justice to Fay Wray in the original. There will be some dispute over whether or not Jack Black was right for the role of Carl Denham and I will say that I don't think he was the best choice. However, Jack truly does his best and I think he gives an admirable performance even if he does seem to be a little bit out of his league. I was pretty pleased with Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll as well. No complaints. The real star of the movie, however is Kong. Given life by Andy Serkis (Gollum in Lord of the Rings), Kong is a true marvel. Here is a giant 25-foot computer-generated ape that actually gives a believable and quite moving performance. It really must be seen to be believed. In any of the closeups of Kong's face, you will in no way be aware that you are looking at a special effect. Quite a tremendous accomplishment by Andy Serkis and the effects team at WETA.     With all of my praise, I do not think King Kong is a perfect movie. It has a few little problems here and there, but for me at least, they did not detract from the movie going experience at all. A lot of people will say that the movie is too long, running a meaty three hours. I think the lengthy running time suits it just fine. This is an epic story and the extra hour allows Jackson time to flesh out his world with details and extra character development that make all the difference in creating a real film instead of just a special effects picture. Also, although I think second act of the film is utterly amazing, it does go a little bit overboard with the creepy crawly creatures. We expect lots of dangerous animal life, but in addition to the dinosaurs we have a giant carnivorous snail-type creature, killer bats, giant spiders and all sorts of huge man-eating insects. After a while it becomes creature overkill which is cool, but slightly redundant. A few less monsters would have been fine. This portion of the movie also does strain credibility at times. I really don't think that you could shoot giant insects off another guy's back with a machine gun without shooting him. Act two does require some suspension of disbelief.     Even with those quibbles, King Kong is a spectacular movie. I would highly recommend it to everyone except perhaps small children. The Skull Island scenes will be very frightening to kids. Movie lovers of all ages will find much to love in this beautiful, touching and exciting update of Merian C. Cooper's classic story of beauty and the beast. It is another triumph for director Peter Jackson and one of the best movies of 2005.      As for the Extended Edition, well this is King Kong, not Lord of the Rings. The movie is not improved by the extra scenes. I would recommend sticking with the theatrical version, although there are some very worthwhile extras on that DVD set if you're willing to shell out the cash.
B00000IQBM|4.0|Jack Nicholson turned in yet another convincing performance as Jack Torrance, who is hired to be the caretaker of The Overlook Hotel for the off-season.  He relishes the opportunity to get his marriage back on track and to jumpstart his writing career.  Instead, the isolation causes Jack to lose his mind, see flashbacks of the previous caretaker's family murdered, and to set out for a repeat.  His family suffers from the isolation just as much and that causes further strain in Jack's marriage.<br /><br />I haven't read Stephen King's novel so I can't make a fair comparison but the movie was done quite well and Nicholson, as always, played his part so well that you feel as though you're losing it along with Torrance.<br /><br />The late Stanley Kubrick may not have faithfully translated King's tale to the big screen but it's pretty good, nonetheless.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I have loved A Muppet Christmas Carol for years now, and have never understood why it was not a box office hit nor understood why it was always so difficult to find on video.  That is, until now.  While the fullscreen extended version is a masterpiece of the muppeteers art, the widescreen theatrical release version is notably lacking in many respects.  Perhaps it is the many years and hundreds of episodes of television production that make the fullscreen version so consummate.  The muppets come across in a more lifelike scale and the atmosphere is darker, more befitting the subject matter.  And most notably, the inclusion of the extended scenes begs the question of why they were ever deleted in the first place.  This film is my lone exception to a preference for widescreen format.  Buy the 50th Anniversary Edition and enjoy it, but you must watch the fullscreen version to fully appreciate the genius of the Henson artists and this production.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is tied with The Bends as my favorite Radiohead album; both are absolutely astonishing.  \\"Airbag\\" sent chills down my spine while I was left floating in my happy place with \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien.\\"

The movie stays with you long after you leave the theater.  I did have to close my eyes at the torture scene.

0312323859|5.0|When I first saw \\"Something Borrowed\\" pop up in my Amazon recommendations and saw the cover with the engagement ring, I scowled.  Oh god, another story about someone engaged and something getting messed up with the wedding... it seemed like the story had been told a million times and a million different ways.  But I clicked on it anyway, and after reading the description and a few reviews, I thought it sounded more interesting than what I previously thought would be a somewhat typical chick-lit-guy-meets-girl book.  I was right.   <br /> <br />I was very intrigued to see that the author, Emily Giffin, is a graduate of both Wake Forest University (a school I greatly admire and applied to as an undergrad) and UVA Law, where I was an undergrad and now a staff member.  These are two exceptional schools and proved to me that this author was extremely intelligent, so it came as no surprise to find that both Something Borrowed and Something Blue were very well-written, above average chick-lit.   <br /> <br />Beyond the great writing, however, it is a very talented author who can make you root for someone who is behaving in awful ways towards someone he/she cares about (i.e. Rachel in Something Borrowed).  I happen to be quite a stickler for morality and, naturally, the concept of someone carousing with her best friend's fiancee does not please me.  I was shocked to see how much I identified and sympathized with Rachel during the entire ordeal in Something Borrowed, and was so desperate to read the sequel that I bought Something Blue in hardcover, which I NEVER do.   <br /> <br />I will say that I found the ending of Something Borrowed a tad too convenient, but Something Blue was such a fantastic sequel that it doesn't even matter.  In fact, I think it had to be set up in this way to really get Something Blue to mean as much as it did.  Like everyone else, I found Darcy to be a fascinatingly annoying character in Something Borrowed, and the journey from selfish, appearance-minded spoiled brat to normal human being with feelings for others besides herself is one that I always find touching.   <br /> <br />The best thing about Something Blue is that this transition does not in any way dilute Darcy's colorfulness and character, the very things that made her so interesting in the beginning.  She doesn't morph from devil woman to the Virgin Mary and drip sap for the rest of the book; she's still the same person, just a little improved and with a hell of a lot more perspective on life.  The latter half of the book could have and would have been sappy and over-sweet were it not for the wonderful characters and excellent writing.   <br /> <br />I'm realizing that most of this review is geared towards people who have read Something Borrowed or at least know a little about the story, but I will say that you absolutely need to read Something Borrowed before Something Blue.  Without that order, you can't get the unsettling sensation of rooting for someone you previously disliked.  Although the beginning of Something Blue does show Darcy off as a grating, unlikeable character, you just don't get all the backstory about the events leading up to her situation without Something Borrowed.   <br /> <br />At any rate, I thought both books were absolutely fantastic.  Giffin does a great job of taking very uncomfortable, borderline bizarre situations and making them and the people involved seem very down-to-earth.  The books are well-written and quick, easy reads, and they honestly stuck with me (and still do) long after reading them.  I can't wait for her next book to come out.

B0000C9JFO|5.0|What a polyglot of fun!  This is an intelligent \\"feel-good\\" movie, and a rarity in my opinion.<br /><br />\\"The Spanish Apartment\\" (L'Auberge Espagnole) is a location, but more than that, it becomes a world apart, that can transform Xavier (Romain Duris) beyond his original goals.  The story is peopled with a smorgasbord of young international talent (English, German, Italian, Danish, Belgium, and of course Spanish) that quickly bond into that one-in-a-million group of friends that everyone longs to be part of.  The movie is touted as an Audrey Tautou vehicle, but her part, while interesting and well acted, is minor to the larger story.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of spoken English and sub-titles will get American viewers through the rest.  The mix of languages and the instantaneous switching between them buttresses one of the pertinent themes: stereotyping is not cool.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone yearning to reminisce about the carefree days of youthful adventure; or at least how it should have been.<br /><br />FIVE STARS only because there is no higher rating...

0316921173|1.0|The problem with everything David Foster Wallace has written, is that nothing in the work compels one to care.  If you read Infinite Jest and enjoy it, clearly the driving force is your own, not the book's.  It is unfortunate that most of the postive reviews of this book center largely on the reviewer's views of why others didn't like it.  It is also unfortunate that those speculations are limited mostly to length and the difficult vocabulary.  I have read books of equal length (Black Lamb & Grey Falcon, anyone?) and enjoyed them.  I employ a dictionary with nearly everything I read.  Surely no one accuses others of disliking The Great Gatsby simply because it contains difficult language.  Condescending are those who believe that someone who dislikes a work is simply intimidated or bested by it. <br /> <br />I'm a lover of literature.  I've read books over my head and am willing to admit it.  At best, David Foster Wallace is dazzled by his own cleverness.  At worst, he is a literary bully.

B00003CXAW|5.0|No matter how much the special effects may have dated by now, there's no question they get you to believe in the story. When watching the MAKING OF documentary and realizing each minute of Kong represented some 1,200 micro movements, you can't but feel thankful.  There are, however, a handful of things that left me wondering after watching this DVD:  1) Denham refering to Ann Darrow as the \\"bravest girl you'll ever meet\\" when she spends the whole film screaming and passing out.  2) When one of the sailors climbs into a three with just the right height for him to become the easiest of lunches for a dinosaur.  3) When you notice Kong changes size all througout the film.  4) When you notice Kong miniature and real-size don't look alike at all.  5) When you notice the human characters, usually in a \\"small window\\" of the frame staring at Kong, are constantly looking up or down too much as the actors didn't know with precision where he'd be standing.  6) When you wonder why in heck the natives build a convenient large door in the wall for Kong to punch through.  Small quibbles all but still interesting to find.
068987474X|2.0|Disclaimer - I've only looked at the first third of this book.  What I did look at was ALL WRONG.    The author breezily explains to women that if a guy was interested in you, he would make a move.  That's it.  Every single time.    I'll let you in on a secret.  Most guys are actually terrified of women... or more specifically, terrified of rejection.  This is especially true if you have an ongoing relationship (whether a business relationship, same circle of friends, etc.) where he will have to \\"revisit\\" his rejection repeatedly.    For some men, asking a woman out is tantamount to a MARRIAGE PROPOSAL.  It makes them THAT nervous, or even MORE nervous.  At least with a proposal, the guy has some idea of what answer to expect.    I used to be like this.  Women would literally pull me aside and tell me what a great guy I am.  I didn't have confidence in my attractiveness, so I didn't realize they were actually telling me they LIKED me.  A LOT. I really did think they were telling me they really dig me as a friend.    As a result -- I never did anything.    (AAAAAAUGGGGHHHHH!!!!)    I don't have this problem anymore.  But... I definitely do see this in a lot of guys.  Perhaps the world the author lives in is full of confident guys.  That's why I give this 2 stars instead of 1... I'm giving him a slight benefit of the doubt.    I'm not done yet though ... here's an added twist...    The more a guy likes you (I'm talking to the women reading this), in some cases he may actually be less likely to ask you out.  He values you too much to risk messing things up.    So... this book is WRONG in the majority of cases, in my experience.  Buy a flirting book instead, to give him signals so he'll have some degree of confidence he won't be rejected.  That's what flirting is for.    My advice -- find out a little bit about his dating experience.  If he hasn't had many girlfriends, he's shy.  If he HAS had many girlfriends, then MAYBE this book will apply.    ---  Followup:  To allthose people who disagree with me, I have two things to say. First. I agree with you. Being shy is worthless. I'm very forthright now if I'm into a woman, and it works well for me. If not, moving on.    Second, seems like most people who disagree in comments (and are probably clicking \\"No\\" to if this review is helpful) don't like that some guys are shy. Well, no s***, Sherlock. Really, did you read the review? I'm not endorsing being shy or taking a woman too seriously. I'm saying it happens. Big difference, but apparently it's lost on quite a few people.
B000BKVQTS|5.0|As a student of german fairy tales this is the best moive i have seen. If you are familiar with the german fairy tales this is not the movie for children. The german verisions of these familiar fairy tales are alot darker than the Americanized verisons. I think that the director did a great job capturing the vision of the true german stories. <br />I think that the acting was great and Heath Ledger and Matt Danmon were perfectly cast as the Brothers Grimm and the story is very well written. I recommend this movie for anyone looking for a moive with great acting and a good story.
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|Wonderful film on its own, as a remake it is a total winner.  Actually it is better than the original, you get a real and valid reason as to why Crewe ends up in prison, where in the original the reason was pretty vague.  Well written, well acted, Adam Sandler and Chris Rock shine in stellar performances.  Very impressive work.  Everyone involved in this project can walk away proud of this one.  Totally happy with the effort and recommend not just watching but owning a copy.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|The music is great!  Now that we got that out of the way let me explain why it didn't get 4 or 5 stars.  The protection on the CD. <br /> <br />The program locks on the CD make it difficult to do what most of us typically do with CDs today, which is make copies and put it on our mp3 player.  It does this several ways.  The first is the program itself which places a program (without your approval) onto your computer in such a fashion that it is difficult to remove (due to the fact that if you try to remove it you could damage your computer).  The only way to remove according to the company is to format your hard drive.  If you somehow get around this first tier of protection there is a second tier which is a shadow set of music that is all garbled.  This is the one visible to musicmatch and iTunes.  Basically the add-on program tells the computer how to look for this second tier set of music (the non garbled version).  Now if you use a Mac or a Linux you will be okay because Sony didn't bother with protection locks for those OS, but I use a PC so that isn't an option. <br /> <br />Ultimately I would prefer if you didn't buy this album (show Sony that if they don't want people pirating music then don't go after those who actually buy it legitimately).  I have heard the same type of protection is on the Dave Matthews Band CD and Coldplay CD so be wary.  Look for that same label  <br /> <br />[Content/Copy Protected CD]! <br />
B0007P3582|1.0|The worst put together album of all time. I like real music. This really is absolute crap. If you like this you are obviously a white kid from the burbs.
B000003TA4|5.0|Yes i know, you think Nirvana is dumb and they ruined music and th ehair band thing but you a re wrong... let me give you some facts... 1. 80's metal died in 1989 anyway, many of the group members in the bands everyone liked turned out being very addicted on drugs, depressed, and pretty much didnt give a damn anymore. 2. 80's rock to me sounds ALL the same, the singers, drummers, all the same GD thing! 3. It was time to start a new music rev. anyway, who the hell wants to listen to hair bands until they are fifty years old??<br /><br />Yes i know kurt was depressed and everything but you have to remember, he is way better than the crap emo, punk, and otehr junk we have today, you can at least give him credit for that... and NO he did not start this stuff... the teenage fags started this type of music... dont get me wrong now, i LUV metal and 80s as well. METALLICa all the way!!! But, this cd is a classic period... and yes they are my number ONE fav. band (nirvana is, not metallica lol)<br /><br />Anyway, the cd full of good guitar thrashing and great tunes for any young person to start listening to. The lyrics are great, sound is perfect, and the ways the songs run are great!! My favorite song by Nirvana would be \\"Come As You Are\\" and there is a hidden song on this CD. If you have the first released copies of Nevermind that came out in 1990-1991, you have it. Play the song \\"Soemthing In The Way\\" and let it play even after it goes off. skip forward until it gets to about the 19-20 minute mark. then a special song called \\"Endless, Nameless\\" will play. This song is very cool and is full of guitar smashing. I personally do not know how the hell kurt plays this song but it sounds \\"Fanique.\\" They say it was a outtake or demo of the song \\"Lithium\\" that they messed up on in the studio but im not sure... The song talks about his parents, yet he is screaming it the whole time, you cant really understand it much... Besides these two, the CD has very good songs and stuff on it. Overall the Cd is very good and every rock fan or whatever should get a copy... i HIGHLY recommend it...<br /><br />By the wat my fav. Nirvana songs off of here are: Smells Like Teen spirit, In Bloom, COME AS YOU ARE (#1), Breed, Lithium, Terr. Pissings, Drain You, Lounde Act, Stay Away, and ENDLESS, NAMELESS (hidden song after \\"something in the way.\\")n it.

0446577383|1.0|I have been a devoted fan of David Baldacci and have enjoyed all of his books.  He has had me caring for his characters and eagerly anticipating each time I pick up the book to continue reading it. <br /> <br />That was, until I read The Camel Club.  I found it so out of keeping with Baldacci's style and talent, that it was almost as if someone else wrote the book and put his name on it. <br /> <br />I didn't care about one character of the myriad of players in the book; and there were a myriad of them.  You needed to keep a cast of characters list at hand to constantly check who you were reading about at any point in the book. <br /> <br />The plot had so many twists that it seemed to have been planned by a MapQuest representative on coke. <br /> <br />The plot was unbelievable and \\"unfollowable\\".   <br /> <br />I have never written anything like this before, but when I finished the book this morning I felt a need to share my thoughts with other devoted Baldacci fans. <br /> <br />
B00005AXEL|4.0|Songstress and Fleetwood Mac enchantress Stevie Nicks kicks off this 2001 solo outing with the title track, a propulsive mid-tempo rocker with great multi-tracked vocals and esoteric lyrics, and things remain fairly strong from there: \\"Candlebright\\" and \\"Sorcerer\\" (the latter written by--but not sung by--Nicks for the 1984 movie-soundtrack \\"Streets of Fire\\") are terrific slower numbers and \\"Planets of the Universe\\" is a fine, rocking love song that parallels emotions with the solar system. Nicks is quite the old-fashioned romantic on this album (as evidenced by some of the songs titles, \\"Love Is\\", \\"Love Changes\\", \\"It's Only Love\\"), but her lyrics are always interesting and the melodies she wrote or worked with are catchy and bright. \\"I Miss You\\" takes an old stand-by theme (love vs. fame) and actually transcibes it, making it mean something; \\"That Made Me Stronger\\"--about an inspirational talk Nicks had with Tom Petty--is even better (however, this song about taking control of your life and being an independent writer curiously took two men to write the music, hmmmm); the duet with Natalie Maines (a clever choice) on \\"Too Far From Texas\\" is fair if a bit generic. The album is filled with joyous musical friends like Sarah McLachlan, Macy Gray, Lindsey Buckingham, and \\"little sister\\" Sheryl Crow helping out--but this, of course, is Nicks's showpiece, and she sweeps through like the moon and stars, leaving behind some lovely melodies and a faint trace of moondust.
0930289234|4.0|I got into comic books late into the game, and Watchmen was always the Holy Grail that my friends talked about. \\"Have you read it yet? How about now? Yet? HURRY UP AND READ IT!\\"<br /><br />So I finally read it expecting to be absolutely blown away. I wasn't.<br /><br />The characterization was excellent where it mattered. The chapters on Rorschach's and Dr Manhattan's histories especially stick out as some of my favorite in the book. Every character had realistic motivations for donning the mask. At least, more realistic than normal. But their actions once they were in the mask were occasionally questionable. Outside of two or three of the half-dozen primary characters and two of the supporting characters, everyone seemed to have a static archetype meant to further the story.<br /><br />The symbols and motifs utilized, for the most part, were very effective. The painted silhouettes, I thought, were flat-out beautiful. However, the comic-within-a-comic allegory utilized throughout lost its initial charm very quickly. After the first few dozen panels of it, I'd gotten the point and figured out exactly where that subplot would end. The only excitement was seeing how it related to the actual story.<br /><br />I've heard people gripe about the artwork, but I'm personally a fan. To me, it has Dark Knight Returns' gritiness while maintaining a more traditional comic-book realism. Well, relative realism. And the use of perspective was effective throughout.<br /><br />My biggest gripe, however, was the supplementary text provided inbetween each chapter. Sometimes it was an article about a hero. Sometimes an excerpt from an autobiography. It was typically just various things to further the characterization. It was absolutely fascinating after three or four of the chapters, but for most of them it was dry and added little to the story. I was particularly annoyed by a review of the comic-within-a-comic. The review talked about flawless writing and beautifully appropriate art, and all I could think about what the fact that Alan Moore had written all those words himself. It seemed narcissistic and added almost nothing except a final paragraph that set up a minor detail in a minor sub-plot.<br /><br />For all my gripes, it was still a great book. I'd still give it a 4 and a strong recommendation. I just grew weary of the endless praise for a book that does have its faults.nd all I could think about what the fact that Alan Moore had written all those words himself.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|In \\"No Direction Home\\", Martin Scorsese gives us a rare look at Bob Dylan's pivotal and volatile evolution from a Woody Guthrie copycat to arguably the single most important solo artist in rock history. And he does so with enigmatic clips of the man himself, old and withered, looking back on a time when everything changed not only for himself but for the world of pop music at large.<br /><br />The film, which uses Dylan's 1966 British tour as a frame of reference, looks at Dylan's beginnings in the cold wilds of Minnesota, his move to New York and rise to fame in the folk circles, and the moment that he \\"plugged in\\" and revolutionized music forever. Through it all, there is the music, which really gets a better treatment than in most \\"musician bios\\". After all, it's the music that made Dylan a landmark cultural icon, and coupled with the various images he adopted over the course of the years (here seen first as a Guthrie acolyte, then a roving folkie, and finally a stoned-out rock god), it is a fitting testament to his aura and appeal.<br /><br />Much like \\"The Beatles Anthology\\" some ten years ago, \\"No Direction Home\\" uses archival footage and modern interviews blended together to present a seamless look at what was, and what is. Scorsese narrows his focus to the years of 1958 to 1966, during Dylan's groundbreaking debut and transformation from the darling of the folk scene to something much more. He intersperses accounts from contemporaries like Dave Van Ronk, Joan Baez, and Allen Ginsburg with footage of Dylan's performances to make a compelling portrait of an American enigma.<br /><br />That being said, you won't come away from the movie feeling as if you \\"know\\" Bob Dylan. Such would be impossible, because in some ways it is his mysterious aura that keeps him in the public eye. But whatever you may feel is lacking in your knowledge of the man, you will come to understand the drive behind his music all that much more.<br /><br />When Dylan first appeared, of course, he was taken up as the second coming of his idol, Woody Guthrie. As he relates in the film, Dylan became disenchanted with the movement and soon began looking for ways out of what he considered a barrier on his artistic growth. What you come away with is the sense not only of how he felt about his transformation to a rock sound, but also how his peers in the folk scene (many of whom praised his early work) felt and why both sides had a right to do so.<br /><br />Bob Dylan's life and work will always be a source of endless fascination for those continuing generations that discover him. In \\"No Direction Home\\", Martin Scorsese has given the world a fine look into his most revolutionary period, a time that saw him rise from the Boy-King of the New York folk scene to a pop icon with a poetic license unlike the groups that came before him. And in the middle of the film, Dylan shares the great secret of what fueled all these changes: \\"A real artist is never satisfied with what he's doing. Once you get comfortable, that's when you die artistically\\" (or words to that effect).<br /><br />And that, in the end, is the message to take away from \\"No Direction Home\\", quite possibly the finest musical biography committed to celuloid. It's a must not just for Dylan fans, but for anyone seeking to make a living as an artist.

B000669GAI|3.0|Looking in the mirror to the past, with Pearl Jam \\"Rearview Mirror,\\" a two disk CD, of Pearl Jam's great's hits.  Pearl Jam is alternative rock band like Nirvana, Sound Garden and Alison in Chains.  Pearl Jam has been around since the early 90's. Made a real name for them selves with their debut CD: \\"Ten\\".  Ten had plenty of hits like \\"Jeremy\\" and \\"Even Flow\\".  Their next album \\"VS.\\" Was o.k? , It had couple good songs on it. My favorite CD from Pearl Jam by far would be \\"Vitalogy.\\" Witch is a great CD.  <br />The first time I heard \\"Vitalogy\\" I was 17.  In 1993 they sold first copies on vinyl record my friend Tom bought it for me.  What'd in line the first morning it was being sold?  He brought it to school that day for me.  When I first touched I could not what to here it. We all decided we had to cut school and go listen to it as soon as possible.  The problems were to go and who had a record player that worked.  Doug's house was the closed to school, he also knew where we could get a record player.  So we were on the way. Then all ten of as crammed in to a ford escort.  Those how don't know that car is small hard to fit four of us in it yet ten.  We all toke the rest of the day and to the record.  I now it is not the best album ever written but it am my favorite because of this memory.  The best part I never got in trouble for it I am not quiet sheer how that happened.  With song on this CD like \\"Spin the Black Circle\\"  <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />
B00005JLEX|4.0|I was one of those naysayers who never \\"got\\" Seinfeld's popularity.  I'd seen bits and pieces of a few episodes here and there, and what I saw always left me marveling that so many people thought it was the be-all and end-all of television sitcoms.  (But I had learned to keep this opinion to myself when outside the bosom of family.  I nearly got mobbed in a cafeteria once by a bunch of ravenous Seinfeld fans for saying this out loud, so I keep mum for the most part.)<br /><br />Finally, I borrowed the first three season DVDs from a friend to give the show one last shot at showing me what it was all about.  I figured the least I could do was watch an episode or two in full before writing it off COMPLETELY.  But lo and behold . . . I  actually *enjoyed* the show.  It's HILARIOUS.  And futhermore, I finally understand why watching it in bits is useless if you've never seen the episode you're watching.  The key to Seinfeld's humor is that the jokes BUILD throughout each episode.  Something will be idly mentioned early on, such as the proper way to respond if someone sneezes, and it'll be \\"hee hee\\" funny . . . then it'll come up again two acts later, at precisely the perfect time, and be *absolutely hilarious*.  If you miss the beginning set-up, then you'll have no idea why everyone else is laughing.  Its humor also depends so heavily on character that watching it in bits will never convey to you how funny George is when he's forced to pay for something unless you know how cheap he is, or how funny seeing Kramer find yet another new way to enter the room is, unless you've seen a bunch of others before.  The writing is what keeps the show funny, but the characters and the acting performances are what make it truly shine.<br /><br />I never realized how different from other sitcoms Seinfeld was until I watched the extras.  There are tons of them here, and the \\"Inside Look\\"s are the best.  Ranging from two to five minutes in length, these segments discuss the episode in question and offer tidbits on them.  An episode like \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\" seems ordinary by today's standards, but Seinfeld SET those standards -- and back then having an episode take place in real time on one set was so revolutionary that the network didn't want them to do it!<br /><br />My one complaint is a biggie, and it's the main reason I'm taking off a star.  The extras, myriad though they may be, are VERY repetitive and often pointless.  If you use the \\"Notes about Nothing\\" feature, you're treated to everything from behind-the-scenes info to the \\"Kramer Entrance Counter\\" (Which is cool -- there's also a counter for sightings of Kramer's stand-in.) to historical factoids about random things mentioned on the show.  Some of the notes are interesting, while others seem to have been written for the mentally challenged.  And if you use the notes AND listen to the commentary (try it simultaneously for a clearer example) you find that they sometimes give the same information at the same time.  The \\"How It Began\\" featurette is even more repetitive and actually uses a lot of the same footage they used in the individual Inside Looks, so I recommend watching that first in order to avoid boredom.<br /><br />Another reason I took a star off is because the show had yet to truly hit its stride.  Season 3 was a lot funnier and I'm sure that once I get around to watching seasons 4-9, it will only get better.  I'm looking forward to it!  This is a great show, and I can't believe I'm even saying that after so many years of turning my nose up.  Well my nose is down now, and I'm finally saying what everyone else has known for years -- this is one of the funniest shows that was ever on television.<br /><br />PS: Another great benefit of seeing this is that now I am deadly determined to get \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" on DVD.  Seeing Larry David on this show, hearing about him losing his temper and watching the episodes he wrote -- hell, just listening to him TALK -- have convinced methat \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" must be like Seinfeld on steroids, with no crazy network censorship and no filtering of David's words through someone else's mouth.  I don't expect to be disappointed by that one either, and I look forward to logging many hours of couch time enjoying both it and Seinfeld.<br /><br />It's a pleasure to be recruited, even this late in the game.vinced me that \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" must be like Seinfeld on steroids, with no crazy network censorship and no filtering of David's words through someone else's mouth.

076790592X|4.0|\\"A professor's final course his own death.\\" (Albom 19). The book Tuesday with Morrie written by Mitch Albom, deserves a rating of four stars, and will appeal best to an audience of thirty to hundred year age groups.  Mitch the student and Morrie the professor have many Tuesday to talk about life, love and death. Mitch is there during Morries last days to lend an open ear and caring heart for his professor. Albom is a fantastic and is shows in this story. Weakness it doses start a little slow the younger reader might find it slow and a little depressing. This book is an intriguing read, and a great story to learn to love life.   <br />Morrie body is dying from ALS, but his mind his open and alive. He shares the values, of life with Mitch, his former student, who has turned into a compulsive worker and, Mitch believes his job and money are the only important thing in life. Morrie has one obstacle left in life to teach his student about love, and what is really Important in life. <br />There is not much wrong with this book. As instated before it starts out a little slow. it does pick up speed and turns out to be one of the best books I have ever read. I could find this depressing. You really take a liking to Morrie and begin to feel his presence as if he were sitting next to you. <br />Overall this book reaches down deep and opens your eyes to the simple yet important things in all of our lives. That is most of the time, overlooked. <br /> <br />When I picked up this book. I wasn't sure I would enjoy this, it looked a little boring and not particularly something I would be interested in reading. I read the first fifteen pages I was proved wrong. Instant love for Morrie and Morrie passion for teaching makes this easily one of the best books I have ever read. <br />
B000003TA4|1.0|At the time this album came out I was graduating high school, going into the college. My favorite music was and still is hard rock and metal. As a guitarist I was influenced by REAL PLAYERS like Eddie Van Halen, George Lynch, etc. I never liked this album. When Rolling Stone Magazine did a 100 greatest guitar player list they ahad the nerve to put Cobain higher on the list than Eddie Van Halen. His guitar playing sucks and so does his singing. These whiny songs brought about the crappy grunge movement with other crappy bands like Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. Cobain has been compared to the likes of John Lennon, how can that be? He wasn't around long enough and he was just a druggie who got lucky. Being married to Courtney Love doesn't say much for him either, no wonder he killed himself. The 90's became a bleaker place because of this band. To this day I still don't understand why MTV and the record industries kissed their ass and tossed aside real talented bands. I don't know what they were smoking in Seattle but at least they produced some good bands like Queensryche and Heart.

I'm actually a country kid, but i did enjoy some of this cd. <br /> <br />There were songs that i love of his on here (The Way I am, Mockinbird, Lose Yourself.)

B000BJS4TO|5.0|Bow deeply to this score - John Williams has written another masterpiece; an heir to the magnificent music of Schindler's List.    The landscape for Memoirs of a Geisha is the perfect vehicle for John Williams to express his melancholy side. After having scored, in 2005, War Of The Worlds, Star Wars Episode III and Munich, this composition rests as the best piece of work.     Memoirs of a Geisha is beautiful, beautiful music. Expect masterful AND tasteful use of Japanese instrumentation. John Williams truly did study the Japanese music and culture well in order to produce such an authentic score. Needless to say, it accentuates the movie and amplifies the emotional impact of sight and sound.    You will be pleased with Itzhak Perlman's violin - the same person on Schindler's List. For the fans of the score to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Yo-Yo Ma plays cello here. Come to think of it, this is the \\"best of THREE worlds\\" and the teaming up of Williams, Perlman and Ma deal a knock-out blow. There are layers of music on each track. On some occasions the music is subdued, understated but haunting. On other occasions, John Williams gets to infuse the music with his trademark \\"booms\\", but never overdoes it - this is especially a treat because Williams crafts his music so that there is only a little extravagance with the brass and drums - but when Williams does present you with that, it is sheer marvel and awe. You will be astounded, dumbfounded and simply washed over by the grandeur of it all. Not to be ignored is also the fascinating and flawless execution of traditional Japanese instruments - the Koto and Shakuhachi, which somehow exude a zen-like tranquility.    \\"Going To School\\" is reminscent of the Main Theme to \\"THE LAST EMPEROR\\". It's no rip-off, but surely sounds similar. It's good to see Williams finding inspiration from one of the greatest scores ever written, and not being afraid to use it. \\"Brush On Silk\\" is brilliant Japanese music (I don't know what the instrument is, but it sure is good). My favourite track, \\"Becoming A Geisha\\" is dramatic, hypnotic and an instant classic. \\"Sayuri's Theme\\" is not immediately memorable, but when you listen to the whole score, it sticks in your head.    Expect nominations for Best Original Score during the Academy Awards. Should even be front-runner to win.    If you only buy one soundtrack this year, you have to get the score to Memoirs Of A Geisha. You will not regret it.    Liam Foo.  15 December 2005
0385486804|2.0|MY English teacher loved this book... but i do not see why.  <br /> <br />I believed that the story line was good, interesting enough to follow (and it helped it was real.)  <br />I thought Kraukauer did not do a good job writing it. He did do a good job with McCandless's story, but he veered off him in EVERY single way he possibly could. I can see why he related all the other stories to McCandless's, but i thought there was just too many other stories. He even found a way to put HIMSELF into the book (what a biography. half biography and half auto.) <br /> <br />I thought it was ok, but not great.
B000AL730O|5.0|From its sonic opulance to its confessional intimacy, there are shades of both Brian Wilson's PET SOUNDS and Beck's SEA CHANGE all over this album.  I see this as a more contemplative companion to DRIVING RAIN, an album which (while it could have been trimmed by a couple of songs) stands as the rock n roll counterpart to CHAOS.  A good deal of commentary has been wasted on the \\"simplistic\\" lyrics, yet it is this very simplicity which provides the album with directness; the fact that Godrich places McCartney's voice at the very center of every song shows the degree to which he understood this.  It works quite nicely as a whole, although \\"Riding to Vanity Fair,\\" as a far more jaundiced, cynical and long-overdue change of tone not heard since RAM does stand out, and is by far one of his greatest solo songs.  As usual, McCartney saved some of the best tunes as b-sides (\\"I Want You to Fly\\" and \\"Growing Up Falling Down\\" are amazing), so be sure to track down the singles for \\"Fine Line\\" and \\"Jenny Wren\\" to complete the set.

0375507256|5.0|Its a mighty Frankenstein's monster of a novel. Or, more accurately, six novellas: each one sliced in half and sewed back into place back to back, as if they were a set of moebius stepladders, and in climbing them you end up back where you started. The scope of the novel is truly amazing: from a tepid 1700s seafarer to a nightmarish future dystopia of the 'genetic engineering/capitalism-gone-mad' variety. And beyond. It is a generous, engrossing, earnest novel which burrowed beneath my many layers of cynicism and deeply affected me. A 6-for-the-price-of-1 bargain!
0385507755|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book; and was surprised Oprah selected it for her book club. In the first place, I could hardly stand the profanity. It is pretty sad when an author has no better vocabulary and must use the \\"F\\" word on nearly every page of the book. Also, Mr. Frey has the most vivid imagination. Instead of calling it his memoirs, he should have listed it \\"fiction\\". I am the mother of an addict; and I realize one actually believes these far-fetched tales during, and soon after,  detox. However, with counseling, they soon learn what really happened and how to differentiate between reality and fiction. Either James never got that far or his brain is totally \\"fried\\". The way James repeated sentences two and three times made it seem like the latter. He did NOT experience all he said he did; that is for certain! This was absolutely the worst book I have waded through in a long time. It could have been more informative to people on the facts of addiction instead of a \\"soap opera\\" with great James at the helm. This was the first of Oprah's recommended books I have disliked. Don't waste your money.
078681859X|5.0|What is it with kid's writers and trilogies these days, anyway? Its as if they've each signed some kind of three-book contract, or something. Anyway, this set of books have something that, for all their greatness, the trilogies of Philip Pullman and Garth Nix do not: a sharp, witty, sarcastic sense of humour: all pouring forth from a demon by the name of Bartimaeus. He's the single best character (with possibly the exception of Pullman's Lyra) ever to appear in children's fiction. He's sly, deceitful and as sharp as a box full of pins, needles, knives and assorted razorblades. And the world Stroud creates, well, its superb. If JK Rowling has you picturing a world populated by wizards with a dewy-eyed sentimentality (ahh, newspapers with pictures that move. Oh, travelling by fire!!! How lovely...etc) then Stroud will dissolve all this with just one comment from Bartimaeus: the long time slave of wizards, who rule Stroud's alternative version of London with a haughty dictatorship (Not unlike the current UK government, really!)
B000BOH8XW|5.0|Shakira is a skank. \\"Oral Fixation\\" she so cleverly calls her most recent output of overtly sexual bile. And the cover to match. Clearly she has to flaunt herself to the world this way since she clearly doesn't have enough time to give everyone in the world a lapdance in person. Oh, she's just trying to be sexy, you say. No, she passed sexy years ago and took a left turn towards media prostitution. I don't care if she has an ounce of singing ability (and I'm sure you know about the technology in the recording studio these days), that's clearly not what she's selling. <br /> <br />So why the five stars? I simply think it's hilarious she's duped you all, and that deserves something doesn't it?

B00005JO04|4.0|I was mesmerized watching this movie.  I've never seen a film which assumed such a high level of comprehension by its audience - so high in fact that some parts were barely understandable for long periods.  The four multi-layered intertwined plots did eventually come together in a moving crescendo and in the last moment the film felt very solid and barren and hot and dry, with its unbearable truth revealed which made the world a much uglier and less hopeful place.      But there were flaws in the details which I thought made this - supposedly a realistic story - impossible.  This work has great breadth and value, but I felt I was being given a worldview which doesn't quite jibe.    -Spoiler Alert-    Bob is a CIA handler.  He's a trusted man with a lifetime career on the inside. I don't believe that his superiors would circle the wagons against him to shield themselves the way it's described in the movie, and if they did do so, it would be 'for show', and he'd be given a new identity with a hefty golden parachute.  Anything less would cripple the morale of the agency, as other agents would assume that they'd also be easily cut loose and destroyed.     Bob would also would NEVER threaten to kill the family of his superiors. That's treason in itself.  And even if he did so he'd still have no solid reason to fly back to the Kingdom and warn the Prince of the CIA plan.  He would never know exactly where the caravan of vehicles was located as he'd be cut out of the top-secret information loop, and furthemore, preventing a missile-asassination attack would be almost impossible.  To put himself back in the game at that point was to go against the entire American establishment - it was a virtual suicide on his part.  I don't see anything to motivate this.      Worse, I feel like.. If the film is about international international bribery competition by nations for strategic oil reserves, I didn't want the oil to go the the Chinese.  I got their point. Fine.  Are the filmakers so concerned with showing their ugly truth that one cannot even advocate for America's success?  Or do they have an assumption here that the Chinese would act fairly, like angels, and only the Americans are corrupting?  Actually everyone is corrupt, all the time - which leads to an even playing field.  It was the Arab leader's responsibility to choose the right son and be ethical and serve their subjects' interests, not America's.    So the story describes a dark game, but a necessary one, and from that corruption there is unavoidable evil and exploitation (the Pakistanis) which we can never cure - it's beyond the scope or abilities of the US to do so.  I felt entertained and drawn in to this film, but with these and a couple similar problems, and this lack of a clearer moral framework - I'll deduct one star.  4/5.  [...]
B000C4SHRW|5.0|Although less powerfully compelling than Phillip Pullman's work, the Abhorsen books are immensely enjoyable and very engrossing. The world that (Australian) Nix creates is, I believe, original to an unparalleled degree in that it has an ancient, magical land akin to Lewis's Narnia called `The Old Kingdom' co-existing (albeit uneasily) with a 1940s British/Australian style country called Ancelstierre, with its tanks, guns, cars and boarding schools. The two are separated from each other only by a wall, but the determined unbelief of the Ancelstierrians in all things magical is stoic and unmoving. However, underneath the fast paced, well written plot runs an excellent sub-story detailing the suffering of refugees and their treatment by the harsh, unyielding Ancelstierran government, treatment that in many ways mirrors the shocking treatment meted out to refugees who arrive in current-day Australia: where men, women and also children are locked up in offshore detention camps for the crime of trying to seek asylum from war and torture in one of the EMPTIEST countries on Earth. You couldn't make this stuff up, honestly. Anyway, read Garth Nix, and enjoy your journey through the Old Kingdom. Make sure you have an Abhorsen with you though, or you may have your face ripped off by one of the undead.

B000002KHH|5.0|Most reviewers miss the historical significance of Paranoid and Black Sabbath. They either weren't alive at the time or have forgotten how lame Sugar, Sugar by the Archie's truly was. This was the time of the Beach Boys and early Beatles (true, they were great, but tiresomely happy) and Black Sabbath changed all of that.  <br /> <br />During Vietnam many of us had quickly figured out how stupid this war was but not until \\"War Pigs\\" did these feeling get so brilliantly articulated. Space travel was all good until Ozzie explained how it had all gone so very wrong with \\"Iron Man\\".  <br /> <br />One of the most important albums of the rock era. A historic achievement. <br />
B00005JO1Y|4.0|I must admit that I thought another Kong remake wasn't needed. Peter Jackson proved me wrong though because he created one stunning and exciting piece of work.  The first hour can drag on too long. But I guess that first hour is for the actress Anne (Naomi Watts) and Jack the screenwriter (Adrian Brody) to get to know each other and fall in love. They're on a ship headed to skull island  where the movie director played by Jack Black wants to film his movie.<br /><br />  When they get to skull island they meet some crazy natives that are very creepy looking. The narrowly esacpe the natives but the natives already decided they want to use Anne as a sacrifice for the giant Ape Kong. They steal her from the ship. Kong of course takes Anne from the natives willingly. Anne is scared to death but soon realizes he isn't that bad. Jackson handles their realationship with great warmth. They have touching and sweet scenes together. Like when they stare at a sunset together on skull island or slide on an icey lake together laughing in NY.<br /><br />  Jackson really makes us like this Kong and care about him. Naomi Watts is great as well. She's sweet and loveable and you really believe that she cares for Kong. She possibly gives the best performance in any of the versions of Kong. I love the scene where  a T-Rex is after Anne and she stands in front of Kong with a  \\"go ahead and try it\\" attitude. The length is to develop her relationships with Kong and Jack. Which makes this the fully developed version of King Kong. Watching it, you realize that even the classic 1933 film wasn't fully developed. Anne certainly doesn't  feel as comfortable around Kong in the original as she does here. Kong is just a lonely giant ape who wants a friend and Anne is just as lonely and searching for something as well. This version gets to you and even gets a tear or two out of you. By the end your just about as attached to Kong as Anne is. On top of being touching, Jackson's Kong is also one of the best adventure films ever made.best adventure films ever made.
076790592X|2.0|\\"Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\\" Matthew 7:34 <br />Tuesdays with Morrie receives a solid two-star rating, because this book is just another example of the influence of mass media and how it makes sensations from thin air. A very syrupy story about the meeting of a dying professor, Morrie Schwartz, and his student Mitch Albom pretends to be a fundamental philosophical research about life and death, kindness and egoism, love and hate. Written in a way that even people for whom English is a second language can understand, Tuesdays with Morrie is a good book for a sentimental housewife; however, it can also be helpful as an educational tool--to show students a different approach to the achievement of the American Dream. However, the banal aphorisms such as \\"When you're in bed, you're dead\\"; \\"Love each other or perish,\\" etc. are good for a cheap TV screenplay, but not for a novel study in English. <br />To illustrate, Morrie Schwartz, a good man as well as a good professor, met his disease as a brave soldier meets his enemy on the battlefield. He never gave up, in spite of a hopeless illness; instead, he chose his way to die. His last days were spent surrounded by his family and friends; each and every one of them wanted to do something for him, to leave for themselves a memory of this wonderful man.  However, the images of a dying man overshadow those of a teacher's life. <br />Another main character, Mitch Albom, was the best student in Morrie's classes; but as good a student as he was, he did not follow Morrie's ideals. \\"No man can serve two masters,\\" and that was just what Mitch tried to do-to serve both love and money. His brother seems like a stronger and more interesting man; I would rather read about his brother than about Mitch. <br />In the fourth and the sixth Tuesday that Mitch and Morrie spent together, Morrie said, \\"When you learn how to die,you learn how to live.\\" But on the other hand, \\"Take... no thought for the morrow...\\"  It does not make any difference when you are going die-tomorrow, or in a month, or in 50 years. One can not be happy thinking about death all the time. The most important things are the ones one is doing today. One needs to enjoy ones life right now; nobody should poison their existence by thinking about death....  <br />On the eighth Tuesday, Morrie and Mitch talked about money. Morrie told Mitch that \\"material things hold little or no significance.\\" \\"Necessity is the mother of inventions\\"; doesn't that mean that if you need more-for example, more material things- you will discover a new way to reach your goal? Necessity is the moving force of progress; if you have nothing, you have nothing to lose, and you're not worth anything. Morrie and his ideals are socialistic, and it has been proven by history time and time again that such ideals never work.   <br />While reading Tuesdays with Morrie, I went through several stages. At first, I thought it extremely interesting; but the more I read it, and the more we talked about it in college, and the more I thought about it, the more annoying the aphorisms got, and the more I began to dislike this book. Of course, this book will have a large number of fans who will benefit from reading it; it will give people a chance to think about their lives; however, those in the more cynical crowd will surely despise this piece of literature.
B000002KIE|1.0|The Sex Pistols are a horrible excuse for a British 1st wave punk band.

B00005JLD4|5.0|If you can only see one movie about traditional peoples, this is the one you should see.  From my own experience of two years living with Aboriginal peoples, I can vouch that it is remarkably authentic.  This is how Aboriginal people really look, act, and think.  Compare it to the rubbish that is \\"Mutant Message Down Under\\" and you see the point.  The filmmaker was not trying to start a cult movement like the Mutant lady.  He was trying to tell a story--a true story, an amazing story, a tragic story. <br />Other traditionalist movies, like \\"Whale Rider,\\" also do a good job of conveying the lives and thoughts of native peoples, but this one is uniquely realistic.  If you watch the extras about the making of the film, you will be even more astounded, since the director used real-life Aboriginal people who had never acted before.  It is a truly awesome accomplishment and adds depth to the realism. <br />Now that you have watched the movie, go to your local library or bookstore and learn more about the fate of the Aboriginals, as well as that of the Native Americans and every other traditional society that came under the heavy hand of colonialismm and Western paternalism.  And then be glad that it was not some other society that came and separated YOU from your family, your land, and your traditions.

B000BMSTMS|3.0|There are going to be alot of old-school Korn fans that WILL hate this album. Each album past \\"Life Is Peachy\\" has featured a different type of Korn, usually one that suffices in some way to the old Korn mob. This cd comes dangerously close to being classified in a different category of music completely. The absence of Head is most definitely recognizable right away. Industrial seems to be the main theme. There is quite a bit of repitition in the music. Most of the songs are bland without much raw emotion. Some songs are just flat dreary. The added songs on disc 2 are better than most of the music on the main disc. This album isn't the worst music I have ever heard, but it definitely left me desiring more. The sound seems too electronic and simple. Another turn off is the last song on disc one: \\"Tear Jerker.\\" This song has to be THE most depressing and morbid songs ever written. It literally makes me want to go out and kill myself. Reading this you might think the song might be catchy like \\"No One's There\\" from \\"Untouchables, but the song is bland, sick, and lyrically the most miserable and disheartening tune ever. I have listened to this album 4 times over now, and while some tunes grow on you many don't. I honestly don't know what more to say. This and \\"Issues\\" are probably their worst efforts to date.
B0002858YS|2.0|Yuck. Well maybe that's too strong a reaction. Rather more like: ........ zzzz. Heard it all before, nothing even remotely original or interesting about this band. I don't necessarily turn it off when I hear it on the radio, but for the most part it's just more top 40 overhyped mush, i.e. it's derivitive and dull. I kept hearing how these guys are the next big thing. If that's true then rock is surely dead. There are better bands out there folks, trust me.<br />Oh yeah, the '80s were TWENTY f-ing years ago, get a clue. What will people say about the 2000s? What characterises this decade? I'll tell you what: it's the decade where bands imitated music of the past except without the wit or imagination that made the music interesting in the first place. Mindcandy for TV people. Go back to sleep junior, music is just entertainment: I keep forgetting that it shouldn't be something more. Trendy, trendy.
B00005JO04|4.0|MOVIE: Syriana is another entry in the political thriller, or maybe more like a political drama. It sits in the similar style of The Constant Gardener, which was released earlier this year. The film is filled to the brim with detail and every line of dialogue is meaningful to the plot in some way. Unfortunetly there can be times where so much is going on that it can be hard to follow. The film demands the attention of the audience, but if you have ADD that can be hard in this movie. This movie boasts an ensamble cast, which means that no one actor really stands out at the main character. You can argue that George Clooney is the main character, but then again Alexander Siddig gives a scene stealing performance as the Prince Nasir Al-Subaai. Each character has their own story in this intertwining plot of corruption, blackmail, and back stabbing. The plot centers around two major oil companies forming a merger, what it takes to make a profit and how power is abused to get it. The film has two very thrilling scenes. One is a torture scene that will actually make you cringe, and the beauty of it is that it makes you cringe through the magic of editing. You never actually see anything graphic, but it will make you cringe nontheless due to the fantastic acting. The next scene is actually the climax of the film, and it has a great build up, if you're watching intently it should make you jump out of your seat. Now for the political side. The film is from the new production company, Participant Productions. The company has a goal of producing films that are important reflections of world events, while still making an entertaining film. North Country and Good Night & Good Luck were both released this year under participant. This film tackles the current oil crisis that is going on the in middle east. The film throws around lots of point of views. We see the situation from the government's side, the Arabian's side, and the major oil company's side. Unfortunetly, the film leaves too much for the audience to follow, it ends up being a chore to watch. A good film, not a masterpiece, but a decent sophmore directorial attempt for Stephen Gaghan.<br /><br />ACTING: The film relies on acting and dialogue, and this film boasts an amazing ensamble cast. George Clooney gained 35 pounds in a month to quickly jump in for the role, and he does a fantastic job. Matt Damon does a great job too. Alexander Siddig gives a great performance too. I also find it strange that his character's name is Nasir in the film, and his character's name in Kingdom Of Heaven earlier this year was also Nasir. Other actors highlighting the amazing cast include Jeffery Wright, Christopher Plummer, Chris Cooper, and Tim Blake Nelson. The acting wasn't great enough to boast acting nods, but it was good enough to carry this complicated plot.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The title Syriana comes from the latin phrase \\"Pax Syriana\\", which is modeled after Pax Romana, and the literal translation is Syrian peace. The film is an insightful, if not overly detailed, look into the world of corruption all for the sake of oil. The film will seem slow and boring for those who decide not to give the film their full attention. This is not a movie where you sit back and let the music and special effects do the work for you. A good film that is able to rebound with a somewhat flawed first 2 acts, is able to provide an interesting resolution.too much for the audience to follow, it ends up being a chore to watch.

B00064WSN2|4.0|I am so freaking tired of people slagging this album because it follows the same compositional format as the first album In The Court Of The Crimson King: metal song, ballad, mellotron dramatic song. Yes this album's first side (Peace-A Beginning, Pictures of a City, Cadence and Cascade, In the Wake of Poseidon) is in terms of song type essentially an imitation of In The Court Of The Crimson King's first side. But I'm going to break with conventional wisdom here:  with the exception of Pictures of a City, I think the songs on Poseidon are just as good, and in some cases better than their counterparts on ITCOTCK. The album opens with an acappella vocal by Greg Lake entitled Peace - a Beginning that is striking in its simplicity and beauty. Following is Pictures of a City which is VERY much like 21st Century S-Man. Both are metallic hard driving songs featuring Robert Fripp's searing guitar. Both have similar (if not identical) instrumental breakdowns, and both are excellent, but 21st Century is in my opinion the more manic and exciting of the two. The next song Cadence and Cascade is a top notch ballad sung by newly hired vocalist/bassist Gordon Haskell who would be more prominantly featured on the following album Lizard. This is his only vocal on the album, the rest are sung by Greg Lake. Cadence and Cascade is simply beautiful with excellent acoustic playing by Fripp, wonderful piano playing courtesy of Keith Tippett and a jazzy flute solo by Ian MacDonald. The mellotron driven In The Wake Of Poseidon is next. It's a suprisingly rocking and dramatic piece reminscent of Epitaph meets In The Court Of The Crimson King from the debut album. But it has a more engaging melody than either of those two songs, and has more lively instrumentation/playing. Fripp's acoustic guitar and Greg Lake's vocals are wonderful as are Mike Giles aggressive drums. The rest of In The Wake Of Poseidon is unique unto itself. Peace - A Theme is a beautiful and short acoustic guitar interlude. Next up is Keith Tippett's manic Cecil Taylor piano workout of Catfood. A song that really seems out of place on this album in it's conflation of free jazz and pop but enjoyable none the less. The long, dark and rambling Mars follows, called The Devil's Triangle on the album perhaps due to copyright issues. Gustav Holtz's composition about Mars the god of war is given a sonically dense and appropriately spooky interpretation by Crimso. The quiet ballad Peace - An End beautifully sung by Greg Lake, closed out the original album. It's a fitting end after the chaos of Mars. The two bonus tracks the Cat Food single and it's B-side Groon are a welcome addition. Groon is an especially interesting jazz/rock? instrumental workout by the Giles brothers on bass and drums and Robert Fripp on electric guitar. Very wierd, very cool.<br /><br />Yes the comparisons to the first album have some validity, the first three songs (not counting the very short vocal of Peace a Beginning) have the same formula: metal scorcher, ballad, dramatic melotron piece. But I happen to think Poseidon is an excellent album in its own right. It might not be as ambitious but it doesn't have the over-earnest sense of buzzkill that permeates the first record. Both Catfood and to a lesser extent Groon act as a welcome and humorous foil to the other oftimes portentious or heavy tunes. The Peace songs are emotionally moving in their humanity and simple dignity. On Poseidon Fripp seems to relax a bit and plays some smoking electric and beautiful acoustic guitar. The music seems just as confident as on the debut album but in general it has loosened up, allowing for some breathing space and release of tension, not to mention humor. In the Wake of Poseidon is an excellent album that has been overshadowed by it's predecessor. Considering the circumstances surrounding this album, it's amazing that it was recorded at all. Essentially everybody in Crimson but Fripp quit the band either prior to, or during the recording sessions. Fripp managed to hold Crimson together long enough to finish this album knowing that the original band was dead. Yet despite the odds he managed to make a very good if not great album. If you are a fan of the original Crimso or the nuttiness that followed on Lizard, there's a very good probability you will like if not love this album.ssions.

B0006399FS|5.0|Hey,whoever wrote that one review bad mouthing U2, try writing a review about the album instead of bitching about Bono's beliefs. And I wonder why U2's concert's sell out in mostly 10 minutes or less. Who the hell do you think you are making fun of people who like U2. For everyone reading this just ignore that review by whoever this person is, because he has no clue what he is talking about. U2 has been around since 1979 and are at their prime right now, and this album is another great example on how great they are.So who ever you are just go back listening to whatever you listen to and let ooo....about 3/4 of the world enjoy the greatest band in the world. Continue to kick some ass U2!!!
0156027321|1.0|I'm mystified by the popularity of this book.  I bought it in an airport before a long flight, having heard nothing but positive hype.  It was such hard work to engage, I had to keep putting it down to do the crossword or watch the in-flight movie instead.  I didn't finish it on that trip, and \\"forgot\\" to pick it up again for a good year or so.  Finally someone told me it had a good payoff at the end so I stuck it out for the remainder.  Conclusion: myeh.  I loaned it to two friends who'd also heard it was good and their evaluation was the same.  Yeah, I got the 'message,' but it wasn't really worth the time it took to get there.  (This is the first negative book review I've written, and I'm sure it's just a response to the enthusiastic hype.  Maybe I'd have been more patient with it if my expectations had been lower.)
B000002KIE|5.0|The album was originally released October 28 1977, I was barely a year old and would not discover it for a decade.  But this album impacted my preteenage years profoundly.  Just like Jeffrey Kelson wrote below, being a punk in 1989 was nothing like it is now.  To be honest, PUNK is almost extinct. To be a punk then you were looked upon by anyone as a derelict, and that was great.  Punk now makes up a large portion of mainstream music radio, television, and even fashion!  The SEX PISTOLS' audience was made up of youth who completely dissociated themsleves from mainstream society.  There was not enough people buying their album for them to survive as the moneymaking machine that the so-called \\"punk\\" music industry of today has become.  To all you Green Day, Blink 182, Sum 41, MTV fans, remember, that's all you are - FANS.  For the SEX PISTOLS and the rest of the PUNKS, it was rebellion.  Make no mistake, preppie in 1989 was more PUNK than punk is in 2005.
B000BMSTMS|3.0|I have never heard a KoRn album that was any less than five stars until now. It pains me more than you know to give this band three stars, but I just have to. Ok, I like maybe half of this record, the first few songs and the last few songs. The middle is just a travesty. It sounds like NIN or Rob Zombie wannabes making crappy songs. By the way, I despise Nine Inch Nails and think they should be banned from making music. Anyways, this is not a total loss, there are some good songs on here. If you were looking for anything like Take A Look In The Mirror or any of their other stuff for that matter you won't find too much of it here. I just hope this will get the experimenting out of their systems. KoRn will rise and rule again, MAYBE?
B000BVD460|5.0|I know that everyone rags on Eminem's musical skills, but remember that Rap is a type of poetry.  Its a music form that has healed many in the industry, so this will tell you about my opinion.  This greatest hits album is a great way for people to get on the Eminem train (who isn't?).  My favorites: 1) Stan - a great song with a unique choice for Dido.  The message and the lyrics are a great story, which shows how some people really are with their idols; 2) When I'm Gone - a very powerful song which carries on his maturity, which has been heard since The Eminem Show.  Is he retiring...who knows?  Hope not.  3)  Lose Yourself - a really good song, which I know people don't like it (too overhyped? - BS)  This was a different Eminem, which is all good.  Great stuff; What's missing: 1) Mosh - I think that is one of his best political songs ever, and its missing?  #$#% Bush! 2) Evil Deeds - this song need play, I'm telling ya.  3)  Encore - A 50-Doc-Em production, where is it?  4)  Say Goodbye Hollywood - Similar to When I'm Gone, but about his own exit from the publicity, nothing about his girl here.  Thats its...I say buy it.  Its worth it, even if you have all his albums...the three songs alone make it worth it.
B00000JRTX|4.0|This film thrives on characters played perfectly by the foppish, bumbling Hugh Grant, the regal (and sardonic) Kristin Scott Thomas, and the very American and open Andie Macdowell. Everyone shines, but not any brighter than the scene in which they are written.<br /><br />The singletons are all secretly on the lookout for the person with whom to finally share their own vows. Fiona (Kristin Scott Thomas) is stoically in love with Charlie (Hugh Grant) throughout the film, although it is clear from the start he is meant to be with Carrie (Andie Macdowell) even if he doesn't follow-up with her after their one-night stand and even if their chemistry seems a bit questionable. I find Macdowell cute and pretty and sometimes witty, but rarely sexy.<br /><br />The wedding bits are usually hysterically funny especially with Rowan Atkinson as the priest, but it's the funeral scene that always compels me to watch this again.<br /><br />The recitation of W.H. Auden's Funeral Blues, complete and quietly, except for a few sniffles, is perhaps one of my top ten favorite poignant scenes in any movie.
0440236738|5.0|This is my first Harlan Coben book ~~ and I wasn't sure what to expect from him but he definitely surpasses all of my expectations! The twists and turns in this book definitely kept me on the edge of my seat! The writing is really good too ~~ which I really enjoy. The suspense was there ~~ I kept predicting some things to happen and it didn't ~~ and once that happened, I was kept intrigued and the pages couldn't get turned fast enough! So I can honestly say this is one of the best thrillers I have read in some time. <br /> <br />This one is about Will Klein, a man who had a hero worship of his older brother, Ken, who has been missing for over 10 years. Will firmly believed his brother was innocent of the killing of their next-door neighbor. He also believed that Ken was dead. However, just three days before their mother died, Will found out that Ken was alive after all. And that is just the beginning of a few bizarre days as Will tried to reconfigure what had happened all those years ago. As he digged deeper into the hunt for the truth, things started happening to him and soon, his whole world, everything he believed in was at stake. <br /> <br />Since this is my introduction to Harlan's writing, I will definitely be on the lookout for his other books. This one is just too gripping to put down ~~ so be sure to leave out a chunk of time just to read this book!  <br /> <br />12-14-05
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This television series called Firefly is simply outstanding! And I was so sad when I heard of it's cancellation. Firefly is a science fiction show about a group of rogues that travel aboard a Firefly-class spaceship named Serenity. The universe in Firefly combines past, present and future technologies. There are small towns that looked like they belonged in the western frontier, you'll even see old-fashioned revolver pistols and rifles being used for combat. Then there are the many colonized planets and spaceships and laser weapons used by the elite. The crew of the Serenity ship consists of several strange characters; two war veterens, a pastor, doctor, mercenary, prostitute, ship pilot, mechanic and a young girl with mental problems. They all are unique in their own way, but they become like a family and watch-out for each other's back. The crew runs into; theives, assassins, government agents, gangsters, police, renegades, military soldiers and more. The characters face lots of dangers but they stick together and have a hell of an adventure. I loved every single character in the Serenity crew, and it made me fantasize that I could join them; the characters and dialog in the stories are so intelligent and witty. There were so many times the show just had me laughing out loud and feeling sad during tragic events and just enthralled by the excellent stories from each episode. The television industry and the general public will realize one day that, it's greatest loss in entertainment history is a show called Firefly. The Fox network executives ought to be kicking themselves for cancelling this FANTASTIC show! The extras in the DVD are excellent as well containing optional spanish dub and subtitles, cast and crew commentaries, the making of firefly, tour of set, walkthrough with series creator Joss Whedon (the master), gag reel and deleted scenes! If you enjoy science-fiction, the movie Serenity, intelligent shows, Cowboy Bebop or just excellent stories in general doyourself a favor and watch this series!    <br />
B000BNI90O|5.0|This score will naturally appeal to fans of J.R.R. Tolkien, Peter Jackson, and Howard Shore, but it is also a real gem for anyone interested in the way music is composed and recorded and in the way themes are developed. <br /> <br />This set includes not only the music that was included in the theatrical and extended cuts of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, but also additional music that was not included in either version of the film.  Highlights from Disc 1 include Gandalf (Ian McKellan) singing a portion of a poem written by Tolkien at the beginning of \\"Bag End.\\"  Bilbo (Ian Holm) can be heard singing the same verse during \\"Keep It Secret, Keep It Safe.\\"  And at the end of \\"The Nazgul,\\" Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) sings a passage from Tolkien's poem \\"The Lay of Luthien,\\" as heard in the extended cut of the film.  Disc 2's biggest highlight, for me, is the track \\"The Great Eye,\\" which was heard briefly in the extended cut of the movie but is greatly expanded here.  This song incorporates the theme for Gondor, which makes a more prominent appearance during RETURN OF THE KING.  The Gondor theme can also be heard during Disc 3's \\"The Mirror of Galadriel.\\"  Although there are only nine tracks on the third CD, it is actually the longest disc in the set due to several extended pieces of music that were written to accompany the battle scenes at the end of the film. <br /> <br />Another major plus for this set is the interesting and informative booklet that accompanies it.  Rather than taking the easy and obvious route of writing a track-by-track synopsis of the score, writer Douglas Anderson instead identifies instruments, themes and motifs within the music that correspond to specific characters, races and environments in the film.  Some of the material may be a bit difficult to grasp for those who are not familiar with the finer points of orchestral composition, but overall, the booklet goes the extra mile and becomes an essential part of the listening experience. <br /> <br />Is there a downside to this set?  Yes.  Quite frankly, the price is too high (although, thankfully, amazon offers a healthy discount).  Don't get me wrong - it's a top-quality collection in every respect.  However, in light of the fact that you can get the actual extended cut of the movie, which includes not only the film but more than 6 hours of bonus content spread across 4 DVDs, for about half the price of this collection, something seems amiss.  (Also, while the booklet is perfect, it is a few pages shy of the \\"48\\" promised on the packaging... why can't the record company just be honest?)  It is common knowledge that the score for FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is actually the shortest of the soundtracks for Peter Jackson's trilogy.  I can't imagine the scores for THE TWO TOWERS and RETURN OF THE KING fitting on only three CDs.  If the forthcoming \\"complete recordings\\" for those movies include not three, but FOUR CDs plus a DVD for each set, can we expect the price to go up even higher than $60?  Probably, but I hope not. <br /> <br />Price concerns aside, this soundtrack comes highly recommended.  It is a perfect gift for fans of Tolkien's books, Peter Jackson's movies, and audiophiles in general.
0156027321|5.0|I'm going to skip the plot details, as you can see them below, and just note that this is one of the best books I've read this year--and when I'm not in the middle of all my classes, I can get through three or four novels on an average day, so I read a LOT.  Alternately funny and tragic, with just enough fantasy to keep things exciting without being too unbelievable.  It kept me awake all afternoon, after three consecutive all-nighters.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I'm sorry; I just don't see a connection between Coldplay and Radiohead. Both bands are good in their own right. I'm also not exactly sure what the symbol on the front of Coldplay's latest album X&Y is supposed to be, although it kind of reminds me of the cover to the Police's Ghost In the Machine. At any rate, this is another album that is getting Grammy recognition, and for good reason.<br /><br />I noticed that the liner notes don't say who's in the band or what respective instruments the members play; maybe it's because they figure we should know who they are by now (although let's face it; aside from devoted fans, most people would probably name them as Chris Martin, that guy, that guy and that guy). All jokes aside, all the songs on here are great, but it's still good that the label released the best songs: \\"Speed of Sound\\", \\"Fix You\\" and \\"Talk\\".<br /><br />Speaking of \\"Fix You\\", as much as I like the song, it's also the reason why I knocked half a star off my rating. Because it's like this: we all know Chris is known for doing falsetto, but he goes off-key sometimes, and it really shows at the beginning of that song. But it's still an interesting song in that it's a rare occasion where the rest of the band sings backup.<br /><br />Listeners will also be delighted by selections like \\"What If\\" and the haunting \\"White Shadows\\". And the hidden track, the acoustic \\"Til Kingdom Come\\", is borderline country, but it still works. In fact, this whole album works. It's not too late to pick it up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert<br /><br />P.S. In response to another reviewer, it's not fair to call this album garbage because it's mainstream and then suggest listening to Franz Ferdinand, because THEY'RE played on the radio too (and yes, I do like Franz Ferdinand).
B000C1YL1G|5.0|Even though you can't really say there's \\"The Best\\" mc, lyricist, rapper, whatever and however you want to call it, out there, Eminem is by far ONE of the Best music artist's ever!  His story telling and comedy and seriousness is what really show's in this cd.  It is basically his number 1 songs on the charts.<br /><br />You need to buy the DELUXE version I believe to fully get \\"The Best Hits\\" in curtain call.  \\"Dead Wrong\\" and \\"Renegade\\" were top notch collaberations.  You can always say he's missing this song on the album or he should've taken this song off the album but in all this is pretty much the sum of his greatest hits ever!  Show some love and buy the cd!<br /><br />Songs he should've had on the cd:<br /><br />Forgot About Dre<br /><br />Encore<br /><br />Till I Collapse<br /><br />Bitch Please II<br /><br />Words Are Weapons<br /><br />Purple Hills
B00005JO1J|5.0|Rent is one of my favorite movies. It is not a good \\"family\\" movie. It has things like durgs, dikes, a drag queen, and some dirty dancing. I just got so involed in the plot, I just loved Joanne and Roger. Their songs were amazing! A must see. (Make sure to grab a sound track!)
B000BP86OG|5.0|When The Darkness first came out in '03/'04 I have to say I was not a huge fan.  I thought Justin Hawkins voice was very bad.  but the tv's in my college lunchroom played the video for I believe in a thing called love, and eventhough I tried to hate them, the song was so darn catchy.  So i recently picked up \\"One Way Ticket To Hell... And Back.\\"  I have to say this album really rocks.  From the faint cow bell and pan flute in \\"One Way Ticket\\" to the bagpipes in \\"Hazel Eyes\\" and beyond this album is purely Flawless.  I would recomend it for all The Darkness fans you have on your Christmas List in your family.
0553573403|5.0|Simply... amazing.  To let you know where I'm coming from, I read the Chronicles of Narnia at the age of ten and picked up the Dragonlance series beginning at twelve; I've been a fan of fantasy ever since.  But, after high school I stopped for awhile to get into more of the classics, you know, the kinds of books people would never read unless school made them (I thought were great).  Then in the past couple years I began again, starting with Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind.<br /><br />Jordan was pretty good with his first few books, but after the fifth I gave up.  Simply put: it got boring as hell.  The same cookie-cut characters acting out the same behaviour over and over again.  The only flavorful character was Mat.  And of course you knew what was going to happen eventually since fate was what was pushing everything forward, so Jordan's glacial plot was made even worse.<br /><br />Same for Goodkind, except only the first book was fairly good.  Even that reminded me altogether too much of Jordan's series, though it diverged quite a bit in the following, more insipid novels.  After the first couple Goodkind books he began reiterating every theme in the most boring manner: talking, nonstop in horribly long and overdrawn dialogues that might have been only slightly interesting if he put it all into a single paragraph.  But no.  He keeps going on and on for pages about something that has already been beat to death a few chapters before!...<br /><br />I apologize for the background, but I thought I had to include short review of the other predominant fantasy titles currently available, to validate my claim that I'll be damned if this isn't the greatest fantasy series out there.  Lord of the Rings was an amazing epic, yet the depth of character, intrigue, and realism here is astounding for a fantasy novel.  In this novel, there isn't so clear a line as good and evil.  Sure, characters have ideals, most being ones that a typical person brought would not think to be \\"good\\" ones.  Yet nobody in this novel judges them in such a simplistic way.<br /><br />In this book, all men are equal fodder.  They live and die at the combined whim of their ability, circumstances, and occasional sheer luck.  Just like real life.<br /><br />Each chapter explores a single character, in depth, all of them interesting.  At the same time it moves the plot forward, often by jumps, the undeniably complex system of events weaved together not by force of fate or nature, but by the actions of characters.<br /><br />Combine all this with imagery and wording fit for a poet, and this is an amazing start to a magnificent series.in this novel judges them in such a simplistic way.

0743454537|5.0|This book starts off fast, immediately meeting the conflict of the story.  Emotions are very well expressed in this book, along with the questions going on in everyone's minds.  A definite page-turner, I finished the book quick.  The more I read, the more feelings I grew for the characters, especially Anna.  There is a twist in the story too.    In My Sister's Keeper, Anna's parents decided to conceive her because they needed a donor who was genetically compatible to Kate, who has leukemia.  Basically, Anna was born to keep Kate alive.    When Kate, 16, is in need for a kidney transplant, Anna refuses.  Anna, at age 13, hires a lawyer to fight for medical emancipation from her parents so her parents can't make medical decisions for her anymore.    This lawsuit breaks the family's heart: her mother (who is a former lawyer and now a fulltime mom), her father (who is a firefighter), and her brother (who feels like an outcast).    This novel is filled with emotion, and the readers see the emotions of each member of the family.  This allows us to go through the family's struggle to find love, as this strong medical question is discussed.  A wonderful read, and I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
B00005JO1P|4.0|It seems biographies of well known figures of the twentieth century have become an ever increasing source material for high drama (Ray, Beyond the Sea).  Singer and songwriter Johnny Cash and his true love June Carter are realized by some honest, heartfelt performances and vivid period settings in Walk the Line.  Directed by James Mangold (Girl Interrupted) from a screenplay by himself and Gill Dennis, the film draws material from autobiographies The Man in Black and Cash: An Autobiography.   <br /> <br />An impending concert by Johnny Cash at Folsom State Prison is the point the story begins as it flashes back to 1944 in the South where the struggling Cash family works on a plantation.  As a young boy, Johnny idolizes his older brother Jack and wishes for something special in life.  Their mother gives Johnny the love for singing hymns while their father (Robert Patrick) is an alcoholic, stern figure.  When tragedy strikes the family, an emotional, dark cloud hangs over Johnny (Joaquin Phoenix) through the years even as he serves military duty in Germany and begins to find solace in writing music.  He marries his sweetheart, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), and the two have a family and struggle to stay afloat financially while Johnny tinkers with gospel music and forms a trio.  When a fateful audition starts badly, he reverts to his more personal, angry music, and the rest is history.  Johnny begins cutting records, dressing in his fabled black outfits, and touring with the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon).  Cash begins an infatuation and life long obsession for June who is also married at the time.  Before long, Cash develops a dependency on drugs with unfortunate results.  His career at a crossroads and his home life a shambles, he descends into a self-destructive path with only June Carter as his true love and salvation.   <br /> <br />Let's face it, the reason for seeing this film is to see how good the performances are byJoaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and they deliver the goods. There is definitely chemistry between the two especially in their duets as both of them show vocal abilities by singing their own songs (as in films like Coal Miner's Daughter and The Buddy Holly Story).  It would require a strong actor to play a legend, and Phoenix proves to be adept.  He gets his vocals in a deep, low range to the point you are convinced that he is young Johnny Cash!  Kudos should also go to Witherspoon who also shows a gift for warbling with a country twang and acting all at once, not a feat to be taken lightly.  Goodwin shines in her moments as the first Mrs. Cash, and it's a shame we don't see more of her in the film.   <br /> <br />The concert scenes are restaged with authenticity while simultaneously involving us with fluid close-ups and sharp cutting.  It's nice to hear some famous songs recreated for today's audience.  Even if you weren't a fan, the songs strike a memory chord regardless.  Like Ray, Walk the Line shows how familial loss can have a lasting impact creatively and emotionally.  The story manages to move ahead a few years at a time and important moments are rendered realistically.  It is amusing in these pop music biographies to see a Who's Who of Rock n' Roll greats in their career infancies.  Just seeing Cash pal around with the likes of Lewis, Presley, and others is fascinating.  A lot of ground is covered in a little over two hours, but it doesn't feel too episodic.  <br /> <br />What the film captures successfully is the affect that his music had on prison inmates and how an overwhelming amount of his fan mail was attributed to prisoners who felt that he spoke to them.  (Watch for a cameo by co-producer James Keach as the prison warden.)  Cash was a man of the people, and the film takes great pains to show that Cash was not perfect and in fact very human.  He succumbs to the temptations of female groupies, gets addicted to drugs, goes to prison, and shows peculiar behavior as he obsesses with June.  Although he was smitten with her, Cash was instrumental in getting June into the spotlight to do solos and to stand equal with him.  <br /> <br />The film's momentum bogs down during Cash's downfall but redeems itself with scenes such as the Thanksgiving dinner in which Johnny confronts his father.  Among the movie's few flaws is the failure to develop the strained relationship between Cash and his intimidating father (well played by Patrick), and the resolution of the film with its family reunion doesn't ring true as one would have liked.  There is an amusing scene with June and her family scaring off a drug dealer who is trying to see Johnny.  More scenes like that would have been welcome.   <br /> <br />There will naturally be constant comparisons with Ray, but that shortchanges a film that would shine in any year.  OK, Ray might be a tad better and Coal Miner's Daughter is the gold standard, but Walk the Line does just fine and Phoenix is terrific.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />  <br />
B00003CXBK|5.0|It's a Miyazaki film, what else can be said.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Let's be clear about this epic retelling of 'beauty and the beast'.  If you didn't care for the original 1933 horror classic, King Kong, it is doubtful you will warm to this mega version.  That being said, this update is a marvelous, big production that entertains and excites without sacrificing any of its emotional substance.  As escapist fare with heart, the new King Kong has blockbuster written all over it, and in this case that's a good thing, a very good thing indeed.  <br /> <br />It is Depression era in New York City where Carl Denham (Jack Black), a frustrated movie director, gambles that he can make a hit film on a remote island.  Denham happens upon Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), an unemployed actress/comedienne, and casts her as his star.  With some deception, he embarks on his filmic voyage with reluctant screenwriter, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody).  Arriving at uncharted Skull Island, the film crew ventures inland and is confronted by unfriendly natives who later kidnap Darrow as a human sacrifice.  As Driscoll leads the ship's crew to rescue Ann, a gigantic, fierce gorilla called Kong approaches and seizes her.  Driscoll and the others are in hot pursuit through a prehistoric land where they are attacked by gigantic creatures.  Kong fights his way through carnivorous dinosaurs with his female captive in hand until they reach his mountain top lair.  Kong is a vicious animal, but he also reveals a gentler side when tantalized by Ann's comedic and athletic talents.  The two begin to form an unlikely bond.  When Driscoll manages to rescue Ann, an enraged Kong chases them until Denham tranquilizes the beast.  Now a major attraction on Broadway, Kong is a prisoner until he breaks free to wreak havoc while searching for Ann.  When the two are reunited, it culminates atop the Empire State Building as Kong is attacked by warplanes in a heartrending finale. <br /> <br />Does the new Kong justify the hype and expectations?  Yes, it is the complete moviegoing experience.  There are thrills, spectacle, humor, and a sense of heroic adventure, which are rare even in the post-Indiana Jones era.  It would take the superhuman effort of a director like Peter Jackson (and writers Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh), who had just completed the legendary Lord of the Rings trilogy, to tackle this project.  This is an old fashioned film that stays closely to the original script.  That Jackson takes his time in quieter moments to develop his characters and never stumbles when the action starts is truly amazing.  Just when you think our heroes are safe, a new danger pops up to keep you at the edge of your seat. He is a master showman of creative, funhouse perils, and when he does things, bigger is better.  He re-imagines legendary sequences from the original and takes them to new heights.  When Kong fights a dinosaur, he battles not two but three dinosaurs in a clash of the titans!  Kong's rampage on Broadway reminds you of the Piccadilly Circus sequence in An American Werewolf in London.  When he is reunited with Ann, the two communicate through unspoken language.  It is a moment of truth that Jackson films with an eerie beauty.  You just know Jackson is a romantic as he sets up his dawn raid at the Empire State Building and gives his biggest star a great sendoff that compares favorably to the original.    <br /> <br />As for Kong himself, the (CG) computer-generated effects are phenomenal as the broadest of emotions and the tiniest of mannerisms and facial nuances (like blinking his eyes) are eloquently captured.  Imagine that, pathos from a CG creation!   <br /> <br />Literally a far cry from original star Fay Wray, Naomi Watts gives the best performance in emoting true feelings and playing off her giant ape convincingly.  Adrien Brody displays the necessary heroics in a role that doesn't demand much more.  Jack Black was bold casting, but his character doesn't always work.  Although entertaining, his Denham is more calculating and morally ambiguous than actor Robert Armstrong's 1933 depiction.    <br /> <br />Technically the film is a marvel, and the art direction and special effects meld seamlessly together so that it is impossible to tell one from the other.  Rarely do the effects look artificial except in the dinosaur stampede.  The stunning visuals and fluid camera work are like eye candy, and many scenes are shot with a fresh perspective or point of view.  Some of the action scenes are almost too much overkill, but Jackson gets away with it because his other scenes are so impressive.   <br /> <br />At three hours running time, it moves fairly well.  It takes an hour to get to Kong, but when he does appear, the film becomes one big, nonstop chase.  There are brief lulls, but credit Jackson with not rushing to an action scene and instead savoring the quiet moments that establish the most important relationship in the story.  What's satisfying in the relationship between Kong and Ann is that it is one of companionship and love without the overt sexuality of the original.   <br />  <br />There are a couple of unsettling moments when Denham confronts the natives and a spider pit sequence that could be nightmarish for children.  This pit sequence pays homage to a scene that was cut from the original and expands on the possibilities in nasty ways.  If you thought Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom's insects were creepy, watch out! <br /> <br />Jackson wows his audiences with his talent for managing enormous spectacles and imbuing them with humanity.  This film verifies his prowess as one of the most gifted directors of his generation.  Audiences looking for adventure of the highest order will find a lot to enjoy here.  It's been three-quarters of a century since the original Kong wowed `em, and it's a safe bet that no one will wow `em  like Peter Jackson for another 75 years!   <br /> <br />
B00006RCPM|4.0|It's a very interesting movie, deal with a lot of high new technology...i think that deal all more with imagination!...It's very amazing to see how far our mid can go! Pre-crime it's just a very crative thing, its an unsual ideia. <br />Of course that i loved filme also due to Tom Cruise performance, i like him so much. But adding the fact of the ideia the film is just amazing. I loved it so much. Kisses
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I liked the other king kong movies but this one is on a level all its own. At no point in the movie did I ever believe the 25 foot kong wasn't as real as any of the other actors that were on the screen. The story the look the feel of this movie were all beyond all my expectations. This is by far one of the greatest movies ever made, and this time the story and kong himself were caught on film in a way that I can only sit and marvel at. If anyone is considering going to see this I recommed that you quit considering and go it will be well worth it.
B000002JSN|5.0|I fell in love with this album about 18 years ago driving in a mates car on a weekend away to a beach hut. I listened to it all weekend. From reasons I can't quite work out I never brought this album until today. I have probably only heard the album a few times since all those years ago, although some of the individual songs pop up on the radio etc. I feel a real sense of satisfaction and awe listening to album right now. Definitely a fantastic album.
B000C1YL1G|3.0|So what's up with those iPod commercials?!? We need an Eminem like he was when \\"***in' Crazy\\" came out, now that was decent. Methinks that the label wanted him to release an album as per his contract stated and since Marshall didn't have any new material he thought he would do the usual, release a greatest hits package. It's sad, such a talent!!!
B00004Z459|5.0|The Freshman Album by Rock/ semi rap band Linkin Park. The song By Myself was the first linkin park song i heard and it immediatly caugth my ear. The whole album just really has catchy hooks like on paper cut and one step closer. And ah yes and then there was in the end. By far the most popular Linkin park single yet. Awesome instrumentals and awsome chorus by chester. This album is a classic and i recomend it if u like rock or rap. They are one of my favorite bands of all time and if u like them then i highly recomend CDs Meteor ( the next lp cd) Fort minor(the new cd by the rapper from lp) POD any of their cds and yeah thats just about it...........................
0385510454|2.0|I have read all of Grisham's books, with the exception of  Skipping Christmas.  Obviously, I consider him an exceptional writer.  Unfortunately, he has written a few substandard novels, including The Broker.  The problem in each of these cases is that he lets the reader down with a ho hum ending.  I felt this novel had a pretty good pace, but the ending was terrible...a real let down!  It left me with the impression that he had written the required number of pages, so it was time to end the story.  And he did.  Come on, John.  You can do much better.

B0007OCG4W|4.0|Wow! I finally got around to seeing this movie, and it was not at all what I expected. I can't believe how raw and gritty this film is...it's not the kind of movie you expect to see Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman in (or Natalie Portman's naked ass, for that matter). \\"Closer\\" is the story of four desperate and selfish people who commit various acts of adultery and betrayal. Dan, an obituary writer and struggling novelist (Jude Law) meets and falls in love with photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) while he is involved in a relationship with the free-spirited Alice (Natalie Portman). Dan inadvertently introduces Anna to Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist she ends up marrying even though she is carrying on an affair with Dan on the side.<br /><br />\\"Closer\\" is a very dark and depressing movie that basically takes every nightmarish relationship story you've ever heard and combines it into one tragic tale. It's a very intense movie that puts sex right at the forefront of conversation, sparing no details. (If you're the kind of person who is unfamiliar with graphic talk about sex, DO NOT see this movie!) Despite its brutal subject matter, this film is exceptionally well done. The four principle actors deliver spectacular performances. (The scene where Anna reveals her secret to Larry is unbelievable...Roberts and Owen are spectacular. Owen and Law also have a great scene set in Larry's office that is heartbreaking and yet almost comical at times. And every scene with Portman is amazing...this is definitely her best role to date.)<br /><br />This is a very emotional, tragic, beautiful film. It's not the kind of movie you'll want to watch again and again because it's so incredibly depressing, but it's a very unique and brilliant film...definitely worth seeing.
B00004T9UH|5.0|This cd in my opinion is his 2nd best cd compared 2 the eminem show. One thing that fasinates me about Em is his sick sense of humor. He jokes around with songs like real slim shady and makes them hits. One track that i luved was drug ballad which speaks of his struggle he was having with pills at the time. It shows how he was trying 2 stop yet he simpply couldnt. He also has really angry songs like Amytiville and the way i am. Both are awesome and it shows how much he was really frustrated and angry and just had 2 vent and let it all out. One thing this cd had that Slim Shady LP didnt have was all the featured guests. I luved the super Collabo B***h Please 2. Snoop and Dre were awsome as well as Nate Dogg. I really liked Kim which is not on the version i got but i heard a bootleg and that song really showed how much he really loves his wife yet is venting his frustrations after all she did 2 him. I luved the production on the cd with the instrumentals 2 songs like stan, real slim shady and Amytville. This CD is a must buy for any Dre, Eminem or just rap lovers who wanna hear one of the greatest of all time rappers greatest cds. He is in my opinion the 3rd best under pac and Big.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|King Kong as delivered by Peter Jackson is a period film, a character piece, and a monster mash, with a smattering of operatic tragedy.  Based on Merian Cooper's original 1933 film, Jackson's Kong is fun entertainment that doesn't feel like its three-hour length.  Jack Black gives a surprisingly reigned in but very goood performance as desperate would-be filmmaker Carl Denham, who has come into possession of a map, supposedly leading to a mysterious island.  This is where Denham thinks he will shoot his masterpiece.  After rounding up a crew (including Colin Hanks, with a nice turn in a small role as Denham's assistant Preston), a cast (including Naomi Watts' unemployed Vaudeville actress Ann Darrow), and a screen writer (Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll), Denham sets out in a ratty looking boat to find his \\"Skull Island.\\"    The key to making this film work is fleshing out the characters enoiugh that we care about them, which director Jackson and his screenwriting partners Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh seem to specialize in.  We don't see a monster for the first 70 minutes of the film, and that's ok, if you take the time to enjoy the human characters.  Black's Denham is an obsessed, unsinkable alcoholic; Watts'Ann has never found stability in her life, but she thinks she may see it in two places within this film; and Brody's take on Jack is honest - he's the true bohemian, living for his cherished art of theater.  He's a little ashamed of the fact that he has to lower himself to screenplays to make ends meet.    THEN the monsters arrive.  The effects are astounding, although they are not always seemless.  Kong himself is beautifully realized; the range of emotion he conveys is broad but believable.  In fact, the key to this movie is whether this synthetic creature wins you over.  In my case, he did, and then some.  The other creatures on the island are a treat as well; grand and eye-popping,  even if some are on the disgusting side.  The monster battles themselves are mindblowing.    In the end, Kong has a lot to offer.  Aside from the action, there is some real heart in this picture.  The plot is a little thin at times, but this is, after all, a remake of one of the most beloved B-movies of all time.  Peter Jackson has developed a style of visualizing and telling a story that is his own, and for this reviewer, it's hard to beat.  The bond between Kong and Ann is deeply touching, though most unusual. Action, drama, and even soem humorous touches make this a nice, broad piece of film entertainment.  (James Newton Howard, replacing Howard Shore late in the process, delivers a nice score as well.)  May not be suitable for some children due to scary creatures and violence.  Final grade: A
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|this album is incredible. As a musician, i truly respect this album on every level. As a listener, this album kicks a mountain of ass. BUT BE WARNED! if you enjoy the sound of their new album, just buy this one and throw the new one away. It blows in comparison. Their new album is far more \\"poppy\\" than this one. Waking the Fallen is probably the best metal album since Metallica's \\"..and justice for all\\" album from 1988! do yourself a favor and buy it.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I happened to catch this miniseries on BBC while channel surfing one day.  I didn't even catch it from the beginning and I was still hooked.  It has a way of sucking you in and you just don't want it to end.  The acting, script, and cinematography are superb.  Each character is engaging and you can't help but be swept away in their lives.  I especially liked the romantic conflict between Margaret Hale and John Thornton.  A bad first impression and subsequent misunderstandings keep these two main characters apart for most of the movie, but secretly longing for one another.  It just pulls at your heart and you can't wait for them to get together at the end.  And the ending is so sweet and perfectly fitting to close out a fantastic miniseries.  A great movie that I would highly recommend!
B000BB1MI2|2.0|I only give this 2 stars because of the special effects and I am a easy going guy.  But this movie sucked.  Depp is portrayed as an idiot, and the overall acting in this one is a joke.  Charlie's acting is at best 3 stars and the music sucked.  Very bad film and a huge insult to Gene Wilder!
B0002OERI0|2.0|Hello,  I just turned 16, so growning up I listened to greenday and blink 182 and the like.  My taste is music has changed greatly since then.  And well im not sure whats goin on with greenday, this album is not very good, pure bubble gum pop punk.  Greendays deffinetly changed.  And am I mistaken or did they add a whole new member to the band?  I was watching a video and I could have sword they had 4 members,  correct me if im wrong.  I dont see many old fans liking this stuff,  They were punkish before, with 2 - 4 minute songs and such, but this cd has 9 minute ballads.  Go pick up London Calling by the clash if you want to hear this style of music done right, dont even bother with this garbage.  And come on,  they've gotta be like 35 or 40 now,  and they're wearing all black with makeup and a tie, erm, whats up?

B00005JO1Y|5.0|When I heard that triple Oscar winner Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson was choosing to remake KING KONG as he next endeavor, I cringed. I wondered what another remake could offer the story or theater audiences. Although, on a selfish note, I just want him to get cracking on \\"The Hobbit.\\" But, I wondered, why make a remake when remakes almost always disappoint, look at Mighty Joe Young's remake.  For these reasons, I decided, that I was not interested in seeing a new King Kong movie. But, upon seeing the trailer, then the film, I reevaluated my position....... I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ART, BUT I LIKE IT...scratch that...IT  IS  ART!<br /><br />Setting the movie in the 1930's, like Merian C. Cooper's original, was the right choice, it allows for an instant homage, it creates amazing costuming opportunities (like any period piece) and hedges bets on the story.  The screenwriters can use genre archetypes to their heart's content and it will not be dubbed as clich&eacute;.  But, the plain fact of the matter is that no amount of CGI gloss could have gotten me or mainstream audiences to see a King Kong remake in a modern setting. This movie like it predecessor, is clearly a milestone in greatfilm-making, generating the awe in film audiences I imagine they experience upon seeing Kong in 1933....Good job Mr. Jackson.<br /><br />Jackson re-teams here with his Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, co-writing the screenplay with three-time Oscar winning partner Walsh and their LOTR co-writer, Academy Award winner Boyens. Jackson all reunites with Andy Serkis (who performed the role of the CGI character Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy) provided both on-set performance reference and motion capture performance for the title character of King Kong. Serkis also appears onscreen playing Lumpy the cook, in service aboard the steamer Venture, bound for Skull Island. Serkis' very \\"HUMAN\\" range of facial expressions are brilliantly matched by the digital talents of the CGI team (I hope they both get Oscars).  Leading lady Naomi Watts, plays leading lady Ann Darrow, to Jack Black's documentary-maker Carl Denham, along with Adrien Brody as the heroic Jack Driscoll.  James Newton Howard (Batman Begins) composed the dynamic, original score for the film. The film is just over 3 hours running time.

0767817486|5.0|Jesus, this one got me thinking: don't run drugs out of Turkey. Period, the End.<br /><br />This is a nasty, pig-blood ugly little flick: Alan Parker (who also directed the equally moody, sultry, sweaty, stinky, and scary \\"Angel Heart) reaches deep into your cowardly heart and pulls out the true guts of fear: you're young, you're stupid, you're American, and you've really messed the hell up in a brutal, capricious, totally alien land. You're in *their* System, baby, and that System brooks absolutely no tapdancing bullsh*t artists.<br /><br />So basically we sweep down into the wild, soon-to-be-arrested life of Billy Hayes (the late great Brad Davis, who owns every second of his screen time and is completely astounding in this role), wildcatting young American, strapped up with premium Turkish hash, about to move it and shake it through customs at the Istanbul airport.

B000BVD460|3.0|Since entering the mainstream rap and pop music market, Eminem has shocked and amazed many and also left behind many memorable songs. A decent amount of some of his best work in addition to some new songs were scraped together for this greatest hits package, \\"Curtain Call\\". The selection of songs include two of Eminem's biggest hits, \\"My Name Is\\" and \\"Lose Yourself\\". However, some key songs such as \\"'Till I Collapse\\", \\"Criminal\\", and \\"Role Model\\" are missing. If this is Eminem's last release, then I am happy because I believe that he has went as far as possible with his lyrical and musical creativity. If you want a true Eminem greatest hits package, you're better off burning yourself a CD with all of his real hits on it instead of buying this poorly thrown together compilation.
B00079FUI6|3.0|It's fun to watch it once, but after the mystery is gone, the replay value dips a bit. Seems to be like a cross between American Beauty (but focusing on the wives), Twin Peaks, Ally McBeal (but not to such comedic/slapstick extremes) and American Soap Operas. At times it is a bit too predictible, but being as it is the first season, you can't judge it too harshly. The X-files took 2 seasons before firing on all cylinders. Looking foward to season 2.
1592400876|5.0|Fantastic book. All you need to know about punctuation. There have been times in the last few years where bad punctuation in society has rubbed off on me to the extent where I've wondered if I've been getting things wrong (and I have, some of the time). It's great to have everything clearly, logically and so entertainingly laid out. A word of warning though: If you think you know it all ( and maybe you do) then don't bother getting the book. It is for learning from and it won't entertain if you don't need to learn. I can't believe some of the comments from other nit-picking reviewers. Get a life, and rejoice in the fact that someone out there realises that people like me, who support the book industry by buying books, will appreciate them more and spend more money.
B000BVD460|1.0|I used to like Em, now I've just outgrown him. This CD is just one more hate-filled garble. Same old stuff, nothing new. After hearing this, it becomes obvious: Em is done, washed up, over. Another CD from a middle-aged man that acts like a rebellious teen. Sad, but true.
B000AJJNOK|5.0|I have the special edition of this CD na d I have to say that although most of the tracks are hot, what impressed me the most is that the DVD portion has the videos to all of the songs(including some that MTV, BET, etc. would NEVER dare put on the air, like the \\"Gunz Come Out\\" video), which I thought was great.

Anger..hmmm...anyway..There is so much talk of Metallica being sellouts, and where exactly did they go wrong, and then those that argue that Load, Re-Load, and that genere of albums was where they progressed and make a musical breakthrough...BULLS**T...Metallica fans, (or should I say that those that call themselves that) try putting together their albums in pieces, and you can see what ....and justice for all was the breakthrough album, and I believe thats when everything started to go wrong after this amazing CD. Lets start off with Kill Em All....This is a typical debut metal album..Raw, lots of energy, and lousy production (i still have the orginal cassete that was released in 83, not the remastered version)anyway, Ride the Lighting was just as heavy, but a bit more polished, and then of course you have Master of Puppets, which is not quite as raw the first two releases, but a great album, still with plenty of thrash, but then you have And Justice, and if you can't hear a difference between this CD and the first 3 releases then you must be deaf. I understand that we all know this was Newstead's debut (well first full length, his debut was the 5.98 EP, Garage Days) but this is where I believe the band should have keep its sound. Yes there is some Trash here, but there are also some slower songs, and you can hear that the band sounds increable here, not to mention Lars is amazing on this album, and I dont think he every matched his drum mastery as he did on this album. This is also where Metallica had thier first MTV single \\"ONE\\" but still werent sell outs considering the song kicked ass and thy didnt slow it down just to get MTV play, and yes it got some MTV play, but never made it onto FM radio airwaves (at the time folks)_Then the band starts going downhill from here..The Black album just sounded like something was wrong, as It never had the intensity as the other albums, plus there were some really bad songs on this, something that I never experienced with the band before (the only song I ever disliked from the band was off Metal Melita on Kill EM ALL) Then we get into the awful Load and RELOAD period..They say they were being experemental..NO way they were already recreating on And Justice, and I think they were still messing around on the Black Album, (and Kinda Failed) then they sold out no matter what anyone says....Listen to all the Metallica albums in Chrnonlical order and maybe you will see what I mean, but I think that you will think that and justice might be thier most talented effort and breakthrough..ENJOY
B0009S4IHY|5.0|This movie has taken a place among my all-time favorites; it absolutely cracks me up every time.<br /><br />The only movie that I have seen which is similar to this one is Kung Pow.  However, I found Kung Pow to have only a few truly funny moments, and it rapidly grew annoying.  Kung-Fu pulls of the jokes perfectly, where Kung Pow ultimately fell flat.  Stephen Chow's previous film, Shaolin Soccer, was equally hilarious in its mix of the martial arts and sports genres of film.<br /><br />It focuses mostly on spoofing Kung-Fu films, as well as the Matrix movies, but you'll also see a Roadrunner scene, and a reference to Spiderman and The Untouchables (which left me in stitches), among others.  Besides the way-over-the-top spoofing, the comedy also involves slapstick, irony, and sometimes being just plain goofy.<br /><br />Unless you have trouble reading fast enough, I definitely recommend watching it subtitled rather than dubbed.  Some of the best jokes don't come across as well with the voice-overs.
0307276902|1.0|This was a terrible book. Oprah said you wouldn't be able to put it down, but I didn't make it very far. My sister finished it because she was curious of the ending. She said it was a waste of time. The way it ends makes it worse. We didn't pass the book around it was so bad. I do not recommend this book. The fact that the guy straightened out his life was the only good part of the book.

B00005JLT5|5.0|Roman Polanski's \\"The Pianist\\" finally brings some attention to what it was like in Poland during WWII.  \\"The Pianist\\" is the sad, yet inspiring, story of one man's survival in Warsaw Poland.  As Wladyslaw Szpilman's family is broken apart, it is one suspenseful and gripping tragedy after another.  Because this film is based on a true story it only makes it more disturbing and depressing.  The movie is just filled with scene after memorable scene.<br /><br />This film is a story of survival -- avoiding being caught by the Germans and starving for food.  Szpilman wastes away in body as the city around him decays just the same.  History is brought to life in this movie, although it is of a time we may wish not to confront, the fact this did happen gives the whole film a very strange feeling.  You just might get chills as I did at seeing the Nazi's use of intimidation, their brutality, and violent force to oppress the people.
0375805613|5.0|My brother and I had this book as children in the old Golden Book Style and I just recently purchased this board book for my son.  It is still a wonderful read!  I can remember fighting with my brother over who was going to read it next and I think my son feels the same way when other toddlers visit.  It is a great buy and is fun to read in a silly Grover voice.  The book is sturdy and colorful and is a great addition to any library!
B000BP86OG|2.0|The Darkness had an interesting debut album months, no check that, years ago.  That was not a long CD, neither is this.  Justin's voice probably cannot be taken for over 40 minutes.  Some people see this band as a joke while others think The Darkness are the second coming.  I fall somewhere close to the middle.  The debut had at least 50% memorable songs that were fun.  They let everyone know they used 70's hard rock as their model for that sound.  Queen, Thin Lizzy prime examples.  This CD appears to be using more of 80's new wave as the template here.  The Cars maybe?  This rocks half as hard and that just isn't good enough.  Nothing on here rocks for long besides \\"One Way Ticket\\" and \\"Bald\\".  Sorry guys but you were \\"This Year's Model\\" 2 years ago.  I would have thought with this much time on your hands you could have come up with something better.  Hasbeens.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead has completely changed my taste for music - and that's a good thing. I have to admit, before I got interested in real music I would only listen to the \\"top songs\\" on the radio. When I first got this album (through the advice of a friend), I could not listen to it. After a while I grew comfortable with it, and now I love it. Out of the hundreds of songs I have I listen to OK Computer and Kid A most.

0553801503|1.0|Were this George's first novel in the series the others would never have gotten off the ground and this CERTAINLY would never have made the best sellers list.  Reaching #1 is deceptive as it was based on the well written predecessors.  This book was filled with uninspiring characters and nauseating cliches (ala the Horn of Valaryia).  I for one cannot stand what Jaimie has been turned into.  Throughout the previous series he was a rouge.  He was daring and charasmatic.  Although I find his sudden honor intriguing he has lost all of the traits that made him endearing.  Cersei is as boring as she ever was and is now a mainstay.  I can't put the blame for this on the publishers as many are.  It is over developed and stagnant and reminiscent of the book expanding fodder Robert Jordan is now famous for.  It was poorly split up, poorly edited and over developed.  I will be going to the library to read the next installment before I decide if I want to invest in it's purchase.  The money for this volume would have been better spent on the breath mints I need to get the nasty aftertaste of reading this out of my mouth. <br /> <br />On a personal note, the whole idea of a horn to possibly wrest control of the dragons from Dany is annoying as she (and Arya and Tyrion) is my favorite character and the possibility that he could take her out of the picture after 3000+ pages of watching her develop has me a tad bit peevish. This has nothing to do with the qulaity of the book but I needed to vent so....
B00000K3UU|5.0|I enjoy Adam Sandler, he always has done a nice job at al lthe characters he took on.He plays Sonny this time, yes still another immautre character.(like in his other films)<br /><br />Sonny wants to gain his girl friends attention.After finding a little child beside his door (Jullian) he soon becomes atatched.<br /><br />Although Sonny uses him alittle for attention, he soon realizes Jullians position and is willing to take him in for good.<br /><br />This movie has its funny moments and a plot that i can actual believe.The music was awsome with the Garbage song \\"When I Grow Up\\"<br /><br />I think this is a really sturdy movie Adam Sandler is improving in acting and in general humor.I really think anyone could enjoy this movie and alot of the jokes you'll probably constantly talk of afterwords.

B000002HFU|5.0|- real. <br /> <br />This album is a classic, hands down. From the pure funkiness of \\"Shimmy Shimmy Ya,\\" which you'll find yourself singing along with each listen, to the hardcore vibe of \\"Raw Hide,\\" this album delivers exactly what you'd want and expect from Dirt Dawg: lyrics so bizarre, and incoherrent, that they're more complicated than most you'll ever read or here.  <br /> <br />This is ODB at his best, no doubt. This is an undisputed classic, and one of the greatest albums to ever come from the Wu-Tang's camp of artists. ODB will forever live on through his music, and in hip-hop fans hearts around the nation. If you don't have this album yet, please, do yourself a favor, and purchase it. You won't regret it.
B0007Q6RJ0|3.0|I heard The End on the Rubble collection with their song Shades of Orange.  That by far was their best song. The songs on here are pretty good, They are not as Psychedelic as Shades of Orange but  you liek the songs the more you hear them.  Their are three tracks on here (Bromley Common, Linen Draper, and Jacob's Bladder) they are like like 40 second stories of a man and things he does, and they are hilarious. All in all I'd suggest this for a serious Psych fan cuz it's not your everyday Psych group.  They have their own unique sound
B000AY74OG|5.0|Madagascar didn't look funny on the previews, but having just recently watched it I can promise you it is really good!<br /><br />A bunch of zoo animals being transported in crates fall off the ocean liner and wash up on the island, Madagascar (this is off the coast of Africa and is an island rich in exotic wildlife).  Naturally they think it must be deserted, lots of squabbling goes on between the animals and they set put to see what they can find.  My favourite character is the giraffe played by David Schwimmer, the giraffe is a drip, albeit a funny one!<br /><br />One minor detail, but I don't think it is any reflection on the movie makers... my son is 3 and found the scenes with the tiger quite terrifying -but then he found the tiger in Ice Age terrifying too!<br /><br />A great movie and good excuse to snuggle up with your kids on the couch on a rainy day.
0156027321|2.0|My english teacher recommended we read this book. I wish I hadn't.  I mean, it's an ok book and it does give you faith and all that stuff, but at the same time it's not very believable. It gets monotonous after awhile.  My primary reason for not liking it was all the brutality in it.  I am too sensitive about animals.  This book made me cry!  All in all, I couldn't bring myself to believe in any of it, and I skimmed through a large portion of the book since alot of it deals with animals slaughtering each other or Pi slaughtering animals. Nevertheless, this book did make me question what I'd do in that situation. I think I'd survive like 2 days out in the ocean.  And I'm pretty sure I won't be stuck in a lifeboat with a tiger, hyena, zebra, AND orangutan any time soon, so I won't worry about that.

B000BVD460|1.0|I hate to tell you people, but Eminem sucks. Royally. He is the most overrated MC to ever grab a microphone. All of his lyrics are childish, and when they aren't childish, he sounds like a ****ing emo. He tries to be funny, but he isn't. He has no flow whatsoever, and his annoying, prepubescant voice makes my ears bleed with discomfort. He's even worse at producing, since his beats are just like Dre's today; they ALL sound the same.     Eminem doesn't have one good song in his whole discography. Lose Yourself is the most overrated song in music history. The production is horrid, and the lyrics are overly simplistic. On most tracks, he attempts screaming into a microphone; VERY few people can pull off screaming into a microphone, and Eminem is most definitely not one of them.    Whoopie. He writes songs about how much he loves his daughter; do you think he's the only hip-hop artist to dedicate songs to his children? Hell, Ja Frickin' Rule did it on his very first album, and yet, everyone hates him. He writes songs about wanting to rape, and have incest with his own mother. He writes songs about killing his own wife.    He's influenced REAL PEOPLE to kill over stupid songs like Stan.    Eminem sucks. The only reason he ever got over in the hip-hop industry is because Dr. Dre was backing him, and he's a white rapper not named \\"Vanilla Ice.\\" He completely ripped other rappers' styles, such as Esham and Cage, and then start beefs with them, and disses them because they speak the truth about him being a biter. He starts beefs with rappers that would absolutely kill him in a battle(Esham, Cage, Royce, Bis).     Eminem is garbage. Eminem is overrated. Eminem looks and sounds like a thirteen year old child, who is going through puberty.    Eminem sucks people. Get over it.
B00005JXY3|5.0|You could tell from the ending of the first `Karate Kid' that this was only the beginning of the story. The continuing journey of Daniel LaRusso bursts wide open in 'The Karate Kid Part II' Mr. Miyagi must return to his home land of Okinawa to see his dying father, but he is also well aware that the scars of his past are still there waiting for him after all this time. Daniel learns of Mr. Miyagi's best friend Sato and how Miyagi broke the village tradition to ask for the hand of his best friend's betrothed wife. Daniel learns through his trip that karate is more than tournaments and trophies. He learns that it is about honor and pride. He soon understands that there are people who take honor very seriously that they will stop at nothing seek out the purity of honor if it has been disgraced. That means anything is possible, even a fight to the death. Only through the sacred rules and techniques of the Miyagi family karate can Daniel overcome the tremendous obstacles he will face at this step in his journey.<br /><br />This movie is one of the fabled sequels that live up to its predecessor. The story is darker and Pat Morita's performance is his best by far. I am surprised that he didn't get nominated a second time for an academy award. The villains are just as evil as the Cobra Kais (who actually make a brief appearance in the film) and the final fight shows that karate is not about fancy moves and glory. The message learned from `Part II' is that when it comes to fighting the most powerful technique is the one that your opponent doesn't see.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|One of the sadder things to happen to movie's in the last decade or so is that big budget popcorn munching movies and high quality, well scripted, well acted, well directed films have become mutually exclusive. Thankfully director Peter Jackson doesn't subscribe to that notion delivering first the excellent Lord of the Rings trilogy, and now the possibly even better King Kong.  Personally I've never found the Kong movies appealing in the past but gave this one a shot due to the compelling trailers and to the fact that after LotR Jackson has earned the benefit of the doubt.  True to his recent form Jackson does not dissapoint. King Kong is without a doubt the finest film I've seen this year big budget extravaganza or not. <br />It comes as no surprise that the film looks amazing as Jackson seems to have perfected the perfect balance of CGI and set design, no the surprise comes in the casting and the marvelously written script.  I've heard other reviewers question the casting of Adrian Brody, Jack Black and even Naomi Watts, but I'm not one of them, these fine actors really bring their characters to life in a thoroughly believable way.  One could also call the 1930's New York a character as it provides the perfect backdrop for our intrepid heroes.  The film is so wonderfully paced that you hardly notice that it takes a full hour before Kong actually appears.  This kind of exposition is often bungled badly by lesser directors, but not by Jackson who really understands that we have to know these characters if the film is to have any emotional impact.  When we finally reach Skull Island, where most of the action takes place, we're thoroughly briefed and ready for a rousing adventure which somehow combines the best elements of the Indiana Jones movies, and Jurassic Park.  Again I've read criticism that all Jackson did with his creatures is rehash earlier movie monsters, but I disagree.  The slugs that suck up their prey were among the scariest monsters I've ever scene. <br />When it comes down to it, however, it's not the effects that make this a great movie; instead it's the fine script and wonderful acting.  For the first time in any Kong movie I actually felt empathy for the great ape mostly from gazing into the beautiful eyes of Naomi Watts.  Watt's performance really does make this movie along with the performance of Kong himself brought to life through CGI wizardry and from the performance of the excellent Andy Sirkus (who did the same for the equally wonderful Gollum in LotR).  The sunset scene with these two characters on the island, and the sunrise scene in New York actually brought tears to my eyes.  Tears in a monster movie?  Absolutely!  You see that's the difference between Jackson and other big-budget directors, he envisions films that can wow you and tug at your heartstrings at the same time.  Not only does he envision them but he brings them to life in magical ways for our viewing pleasure.  Heck, if Mr. Jackson did a remake of the Attack of the Killer Tomatoes I'd probably go see it.  He's that good. <br />While most of my praise so far has been directed at Peter Jackson and Naomi Watts, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fine performances from Adrian Brody, Jack Black and the fine supporting cast including, but not limited to, a small but fine performance4 from Colin Hanks.  These characters all have a few great moments which is no small feat in a movie that features a beautiful woman and a 25 foot Ape. <br />In the end I can't find any fault in this movie, its wonderful escapism and an emotional wallop to boot.  Thanks for the Christmas present Peter Jackson. <br />
B0000025RI|4.0|Michael Jackson's career took off big time after the release of this exceptionally strong piece of pop music. He became the biggest name across the world. In the end the man became the biggest controversial figures ever.  Whether or not the man is truly what he was made out to be, one thing still stands, he was and still is a great artist. This leads us into his most famous work, Thriller.    Thriller opens up with the funky groove of \\"Wanna Be Starting Something\\". The track features an African chant and horns all into the mix. Jackson's lyrics tell us a tale of paranoia about a female's accusations. The following track is a disco like tune with titled \\"Baby Be Mine\\".  Jackson's smooth voice makes it a nice listen.  \\"The Girl Is Mine\\" became the first major hit on the album. It's a fun little duet with Paul McCartney in which they both playfully argue over a girl.    The album's title track became another massive hit including its extremely creative and famous video. Its dark grooves and horror themed will forever be a Halloween favorite. The famous Vincent Price spoken verses are my favorite part of the song. \\"Beat It\\" was another smash hit single, and the only pure rock song on the album. It has an insanely catchy riff and hook, and a great solo by Eddie Van Halen.     Billie Jean is by far the best and most memorable track on the album. It leaves us where \\"Starting Something\\" left off in the story of this groupie who Jackson supposedly bearing her child which he denies. It has one of the most recognized bassline in the history of music. Its strings, horns, and vocals seem to be mixed in perfectly. \\"Human Nature\\" is a light track about living the way one wants to. Jackson's vocal flow shines on this track as well. \\"PYT\\" is another upbeat funk bassline track that really seems to define the type of sound that was popular at the time. It's a pretty catchy track. The album ends a nice, but not spectacular ballad \\"Lady In My Life\\".     The only thing Jackson's popularity created a backlash upon was his own personality and ability to handle his stardom and the fact that popular music today is filled with totally unoriginal and annoying artists that mimic themselves after him. No matter what happens; Thriller still remains a classic of pop music even if it's not \\"perfect\\".

B0008JIJ2E|5.0|Between the hyjinx of `Ghostbusters' and the use of bananas to fight crime in `Beverly Hills Cop', there was `The Karate Kid'. It still amazes me that a 23 year old Ralph Macchio plays a 17 year old adolescent from Jersey, anyway what can be said about this film. `The Karate Kid' is a fun coming of age film with a huge heart to go with it. Daniel LaRusso arrives in California only to discover that it's not the same as the East Coast. He is labeled as an outcast by the powerful, rich elite of The Valley who comes down upon him at full force with a brutal and violent form of karate. Daniel sees that even learning karate is no the place for him, as he sees the local sensei (The Evil John Kreese) is just as cruel and merciless. Daniel is determined not to seek revenge, but to gain respect and acceptance as an equal in his new home. Befriending his apartments handyman Mr. Miyagi (The late Pat Morita), he learns that the true nature of karate comes from the will to be true to yourself and that if you are pure at heart you can accomplish anything. That also includes catching flies with chop sticks.<br /><br />This movie is a pleasure to watch from start to finish. The acting is amazing and the characters are unforgettable. It is one of those movies that stands the test of time and can be enjoyed by all ages. The last scene in this movie is probably one of the most memorable in movie history. It is when Daniel used the `Crane' technique to beat is nemesis Johnny Lawrence only to receive the trophy from the exact same person with a look of respect and a statement to match. I agree with that statement and that is what true movie magic is all about. As Johnny said...\\"You're alright LaRusso!\\"
B000B8QEYC|3.0|If you own Watermark, Shepherd Moons, The Memory of Trees, or A Day Without Rain, you already own this album.  As much as I love the past work of Enya, Amarantine breaks no new ground whatsoever.   <br /> <br />While Enya's continued work with Roma Ryan and Nicky Ryan is one of her strengths in terms of harmony of artistic vision, it is also her greatest weakness on another level: it's lead to artistic inbreeding.  \\"The River Sings\\" is essentially the same song as \\"Ebudae\\" on Shepherd Moons but with a different set of lyrics; \\"Amarantine\\" matches \\"Only Time\\" from A Day Without Rain and \\"On My Way Home\\" from The Memory of Trees down to the 'lo ro ho\\" style backing vocals.  Arrangements do-si-do: you may hear a particular vocal arrangement on one song, only to hear it again on a different album but with matched with the instrumental arrangement of a different song.  This had started to become clear that this inbreeding was happening on A Day Without Rain, but in Amarantine it peaked to the point of obviousness. <br /> <br />Amarantine is comfort music: longtime fans will be delighted that this is the same Enya since The Celts with very little deviation.  However, those hoping for some experimentation (or at least more than just variations of the same six songs Enya has been recording  since Watermark) will be sorely disappointed.  The style is there, but the soul of Enya's previous work is sadly absent.
B00000DQSS|5.0|To start, this album features some of the best Kate songs, and also some of her not-so-best songs. The best tracks are Babooshka, Army Dreamers and Breathing. The worst being Delius, The Infant Kiss and Night Scented Stock. Here is a short track-by-track review of this album:<br /><br />The album begins with the strings of Babooshka. This is my second favourite, and ironically the most commericially successful single from this album. Babooshka got to #5 in the UK, going Silver (200 000 copies sold) and got to #1 in Australia! I especially like the loud chorus and original subject matter. Track 2, Delius is okay. It is not one of my favourites as it is just a bit plain and bland sort of, but I still like the song, sort of. Blow Away is my fifth favourite at the moment. Kate wrote this song for one of her band members. I found it a bit lame at first, but I now I like it a lot. All We Ever Look For is also a song that I had to let grow on me. It is basically about what humans should look for i.e. family and such.<br /><br />I heard somewhere that fans commonly share a belief that Egypt isn't very good, whereas I think it is the best non-single released song on the entire album. Despite the song being written / released more than 25 years ago, Egypt still comes to mind when you listen to this, which is very uncommon in music of this time. The backing vocals are particularly haunting. Track #6, The Wedding List is a fun (yes, fun) song about a wife who kills her husband. Note that a few of songs on this CD are about death - how ironic! Where was I... oh yes.... The Infant Kiss - this song is boring, or maybe I have to let it grow on me because this song really is different. The actual song won an award in which I have forgot the name for the lyric \\"There's a man behind those eyes\\" Night Scented Stock is a short song - 40 to 50 seconds - pretty cool.<br /><br />The final two songs, with Babooshka are in my opinion, the best of \\"Never Forever\\". These last two songs both got to #16 in the UK, despite the fact that they are very different and quite inaccessible. Breathing is easily one of Kates top 5, at most top 10 songs of her career. I could write soooo much about this song. It goes for 5:25 which makes it easily the most longest song on the album. The only other song that goes for more than 3 minutes is, I think only Egypt. It is about a pregnant mother whose unborn child is suffering from all kinds of gas that her mother is breathing in because of which I think is a nuclear war. And agin, the subject of this song was very very different to anything that was out in 1980 or before. Whereas nowadays, we have artists such as Bjork especially, Tori Amos etc. who write songs about all weird and wonderful stuff. And by the way, the video of this song is absolutely awesome. And the last part of this song will leave the listener in awe.<br /><br />Therefore, I enjoyed this album very much. I only own two Kate Bush albums (w/ The Kick Inside) but I will very soon have all of them. In my opinion, this album is, by not very much at all,better than The Kick Inside, mainly because of the masterpieces Babooshka, Army Dreamers and Breathing.<br /><br />9.5 / 10both got to #16 in the UK, despite the fact that they are very different and quite inaccessible.

If you were to take just the Highlights of Kong and fit it into an hour long documentary, it would be very difficult, you would be cutting something. Its that good.<br /><br />The Scenery is constantly changing and the creatures vary from scene to scene. Thankfully they allow us to meet the characters and hold back Kong until the first hour. That is a lesson for all filmakers, if you show the monster quickly you've blown your load. Take Jaws or Shining for good examples. The tension builds until the final second, then the fx extravaganza begins. Kong is a beautiful creation.<br /><br />Hats off to WEDA for the incredible amounts of detail and precision. Also, for creating a film where it becomes very difficult to decifer between REAL, CG, Miniatures and Bigatures. It blends seamlessly. KING KONG is why we go to the movies. It is the new standard, which makes Titanic look like a kindergarden project.<br /><br />The casting is phenomenal. Jack Black's serious turn as an \\"Orson Wells-like\\" film director shows a new side to his tallent. It is awesome to see Collin Hanks making his way in the world as he plays the directors assistant. (Black and Hanks also worked together in \\"Orange County\\". Check that film out so see these guy's range.) Naomi Watts is the go-to actress for struggling actresses. As in Mulholland Drive she is a lady in need of a part. The role she finds is much bigger than she anticipates, and does a wonderful job doing it. Adrian Brody (as in The Pianist) is powerful in his subtle ways. \\"Less is More\\" is a brilliant motto for him to live by. The many remaining supporting actors and crew should also be applauded.<br /><br />Finally, what can be said about the multi-tallented, Andy Serkis? Not only does he play the embodiment of Kong for the animators, he also gives a go as a cook who's soup doubles for shaving cream. Serkis has captured our hearts before as the very torn Smeagal/Gollem. It seems we will see him return again soon... Production on the HOBBIT begins next winter. (That's official).<br /><br />King Kong is like a double-shot of epic with a lot of heart.

B00005M91K|5.0|Truly one of the most beautuflly filmed movies ever made. The cinematography is revolutionary. Filmed on 70mm fil, Fricke captures the True beauty of many cultures and places. A breathtaking film from start to finish.
B000B19BCG|4.0|Supergrass is one of those rare bands whose songs and albums improve with every listen. And rarely has there been a group of guys who have such a massive variety of influences, old and new, and are able to mold and mesh those into a distinctive sound of their own. Though R to R is mostly sans the \\"youthfull exuberance\\" of their earlier efforts, it is still unmistakenly a Supergrass record, and it might actually win them some new fans. <br />For old fans it's a delight. <br />Looking forward to their next one.
B00009W0WM|5.0|I quite simply love this movie. The acting is great (cast includes, Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains) and it has an awesome story line, and to tell the truth, five years ago, I was not interested in movies such as CASABLANCA. I used to really dislike black and white movies, but then I really began to appreciate movies such as this, ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE and WUTHERING HEIGHTS. Now I'd prefer a good ol' classic any day over dull sitcoms or reality shows.  <br /> To summarize, this movie is based in Casablanca (in Africa) and this place serves as an \\"in between\\" point for many people in Europe trying to make their way to the U.S. In Casablanca, there is a popular nightclub/casino called Rick's Cafe. It is at this place where a lot a \\"wheeling and dealing\\" goes on between the people trying to leave Casablanca, and those who forge and work out the paperwork (a lot of money is spent too). It is also at this location where a certain woman walks back into a mans life. This movie it TOO good to spoil, so I'll stop there, but please if you get a chance, watch this movie!!!!
B00005ML1O|4.0|There are times during any infidelity where if you continue your infidelity, you will almost certainly loose your spouse. Now, just imagine a time when investigating a very brief, potential infidelity / relationship outside of his marriage it almost cost Tom Cruise his life. Or worse yet, he placed his families safety in significant jeopardy simply because he held a temporary fascination with a lifestyle led by very few, which he stumbled across when he ran into an old male friend who was a professional musician. <br /> <br />Although Dr. William Harford (Cruise) is living in New York's high society, there is an entire exclusive society for the Ultra Wealthy which has orgies of massive proportions. Every member of the secret society must always keep their face covered with a mask while they are at these functions.  <br /> <br />A combination of Dr. Harford's uncontrollable curiosity about this secret society was moved along dramatically by his wife's (Nicole Kidman) admission of sexual longings with a sailor at a recent resort while the Dr's family was on vacation. Suddenly Tom Cruise was headed directly into maritial infidelity with the stunning beauty he meets at his best friends home during a party. They are unable to connect at this party but he has plans to see this new female soon. And he does, at the morgue. <br /> <br />Tom's Cruises character in Eyes Wide Shut is reminded in a very frightening manner how close he was to the edge and how close he had driven the family he loves near disaster.  <br /> <br />This is Director Stanley Kubricks last film and it is truly a classic. While it shares some of the normal characteristics of other films which Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman have made either together or apart, this film takes us to places most of us have never thought about nor that we may even want to think about.  <br /> <br />This is a very daring film and one which truly stands out alone. There are several brief parts of this film where an X Rating probably had to be considered. Through a combination of creative shot angles and using others bodies to block parts of questionable scenes, this film was able to be released with the R Rating. <br /> <br />This is CLEARLY an R Rated film. This is not a film that would be appropriate for anyone under age 18 or 21. I enjoyed this film and have seen it many times. This film is so loaded with characters, parts of the plot, conversation and great filming locations, that watching this movie many times will bring something new to you each time. I would give this movie two thumbs way up and say it certainly is a must see for adults who enjoy watching Cruise and Kidman films. <br /> <br /> <br />
0385507755|2.0|I think that the book is pure fiction.   <br />I have worked as a therapist in a rehab and I know that the fantasy stuff that he is claiming happened would not have happened in a real rehab.  There are so many people waiting in line to get a shot at being sober and \\"humble\\".  He would have been out of the rehab so fast if he carried on the way that he claims!    <br /> <br />Frey is arrogant and self praising.  I would rather like the book more if it was considered fiction.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Ummm where do all these boneheads get the idea that Godsmack are Alice In Chains wanna be's ? They must have rocks in the melon. <br /> <br />Ths Godsmack release is rocking and another great release from them ! <br /> <br />I Stand Alone kicks..but this cd and CRANK it up and leave the Alice In Chains (one of my fave bands) VS Godsmack commments in your own warped head.
B00003CXDB|2.0|If you have any business experience, you will laugh at this unrealistic look at big business.  Beyond this the acting ranges from bad to fair.  Now Douglas did win an Oscar but it really was for his performance in Fatal Attraction not this film.  Wall Street has the Oliver Stone pedigree.  And since he is a Hollywood darling, it is more acceptible to award this film than a torid film like Fatal Attraction.
B000BM6AVA|1.0|What a way to rip off your fans! Release a double album as two separate albums. System of a Down obviously know their fans well enough to realise that they don't listen for the music, but buy it for the image that for some reason makes kids cool. So they knew that their fans would buy it anyway. A real music aficionado would have said `Hang On; this is a dodgy plan by a band wanting some extra Christmas cash'.<br /><br />It's so disappointing when a band that stand for equality and justice do the dirty on you. I have never liked System's music, but I do agree with their political stance. For this reason I always make an effort to take a listen, but not after this dirty trick. It's fine to preach about injustice, but now they sound like hypocrites.<br /><br />And the music's nothing new, it sounds exactly like `Mezmerize' and all their albums before that. They would have been better of releasing a singles collection. If you're a system fan already you won't care what I've just said, If your not, don't bother, you aren't missing out on much.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Music, as defined by dictionary.com: <br /> <br />1. The art of arranging sounds in time so as to produce a continuous, unified, and evocative composition, as through melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.  <br />2. Vocal or instrumental sounds possessing a degree of melody, harmony, or rhythm.  <br /> <br />As far as I can tell, The Subliminal Verses contains almost none of the above. And before you all jump on me, yes, I did listen to the CD. My sister owns it, and my brain explodes every time I'm forced to listen to it. The only songs I can tolerate and/or like are Vermilion Pt. 2, Circle and certain parts of The Nameless. <br /> <br />Slipknot does not create music. They create headaches. They sound like a gaggle of monkeys on crack banging metal trashcans together. <br /> <br />Furthermore, why would anyone take pride in being called a maggot? Do you people know what a maggot is? Take pride in yourselves - cease calling yourselves maggots, and listen to better music. There are tons of musicians in the metal genre out there who can actually make music.
B00005EAXF|5.0|This DVD shows what phenomenal musicians Scorpions truly are. The music selection is perfect, with a few new tunes thrown in. They cover songs from Kansas and The Cars as well.  I listen to the DVD over and over. Sometimes I throw it in for background music it's so good.  I wasn't sure at first if this would be any good.  There are some acoustic performances out there that aren't that good, trying to capture on the trend set by Tesla long ago.  <br /> <br />Production quality is excellent, with many cameras set to cover the performance.  Also, there is footage from back stage, etc... If you are a Scorpions fan, or just a fan of quality rock and roll, you will very happy with this CD.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|You know a movie was great when you sit there after it finishes and wish it were longer.  Serenity is that kind of movie.  I felt that there were some story plots that could have been further explored, but regardless, the movie kept me entertained throughout.. something that is difficult to find in alot of movies now.  This is definitely a DVD that I'm going to purchase.  Not because I have hope that DVD sales will help the series continue, but because I really did enjoy the movie and would watch it again. If you haven't, you should.
B000089CJI|5.0|I overheard one of my friends talking about this CD and I immediately wasn't interested because I heard it had something to do with Death Cab for Cutie. I didn't like that band at all and I thought that Postal Service was just another way to get more dough out of DCFC fans.<br /><br />Then I heard how they made this record and it interested me. I thought what the hell I'll give it a try. So I went to my local library and they just happened to have a copy. To make a long story short I listened and loved it.<br /><br />The songs are so weird it's hard to categorize them to the genre of music it is. I also happened to love Ben Gibbard's voice. The songs are catchy as hell and the lyrics are surprisingly deep and thoughtful. After listening to it many times I wanted more so I listened to some Death Cab stuff and it really opened the flood gates because now I am a big fan of theirs too. I guess I really didn't give them a chance.<br /><br />I give this 5 starts because it's incredibly original and incredibly good. This of course isn't for everyone but I say give it a chance you might like it. Listen to \\"Such Great Heights\\" that one will reel you in.
B000026258|5.0|This is a brilliant - arguably the definiitive - recording of a challenging and visionary work by one of our most gifted and consistently interesting contemporary composers. Any of the three available studio performances has merit (I haven't experienced the live recording) and each offers something different in tempo, mix, length...this is my favorite and the one I recommend to friends.  <br /> <br />The previous reviewer who gave it one star and warned not to bother also gave five stars to a soundtrack recording of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera (one star each, I guess, for overblown synthetic emotions, derivative motifs, utterly goofy lyrics, cheesy Broadway mock-opera presentation and people in cat suits. No, sorry, that was one of Sir Andy's other \\"masterpieces\\".) No surprise that Reich and Music for 18 Musicians eludes him. If you, on the other hand, appreciate genuinely original composition and music with the power to transport, this piece, and this recording in particular, will be a staple in your collection. If you're not yet familiar with much/any other Steve Reich work, this is the perfect way in.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I just came back from seeing the movie and I am still astounded how great this movie is!! Compared to the original which is a great movie, this one is better by a lot. Now for the story:  A frustrated movie director decides to make a desperate attempt at making a hit movie by travelling to Skull Island, a remote, unlocated island \\"surrounded by fog\\". On the way he picks up Naomi Watts as the new star and Adrien Broody as the screenplay writer. They quickly set sail. After a fierce storm, they are on the island. In the night a bunch of cannibals fly on sticks *you have to see that scene* capture Naomi and set her on a plank to be the sacrifice for their \\"god\\" Kong. Brody notices her absence, and along with the crew go to find her. Meanwhile, Kong and Naomi start as enemies, but slowly, a beauty and the beast relationship starts to show. Meanwhile Brody and the crew get caught in a dinosaur stamped, attacked by Cockroaches, Large Scorpion Spider Thingies but finally get out and find the girl. They chloroform and capture the poor Kong. There in New York it escapes, runs loose, encounters a spectacular fight on the top of the Empire State Building and falls to his death.  This movie was fantastic, no doubt about it. The characters were great, the special effects were amazing, and the whole movie was just astounding. Go Kong!!!  Pros- Acting, Special Effects, KONG(obviously), Scenery, Music  Cons- None
B000069AUI|5.0|This is a must-have album for anyone remotely interested in Coldplay or Britpop/rock. The success of the AROBTTH singles only tells half the story. \\"Politik\\" and \\"A Whisper\\" get your pulse racing, while \\"A Rush of Blood\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\" make you think. The love songs are folky, upbeat \\"Green Eyes\\" and the yearning, redemptive \\"Warning Sign\\". \\"Daylight\\" is also a great song (the live-DVD version is not to be missed).

B00092ZMDY|5.0|Amazing, mesmerizing, magical....this DVD, this concert is truely a culmination of amazing musical talent, hardwork, and chemistry by all members of the band. I have owned this DVD for about 3 months and have watched it over and over, and just sit back and revel in the sheer genius of these guys. The quality of both the video and audio will make even the most demanding of listeners grin with knowing that this is a first-rate production. <br />The concert is a fantastic blend of the old hits, as well as new work that is impressive. The quitar work is flawless, and the addition of the backup musicians, especially the 'Mighty Horns' gives the band a much larger dimension. These guys still ROCK! Buy this DVD, you will not be sorry!
0060955775|3.0|While I agree with the overall message to live genuinely and passionately, I felt it was lost somewhat in the packaging of the book. It was a somewhat disembodied version of mental illness, depicting it like a philosophical choice. Indeed, living life on the surface and according to social prescription may contribute to mental suffering, but such suffering is rarely such a clear cut choice as depicted in the book. Malaise is the problem of the modern world. However, malaise is to mental illness as a cold is to pneumonia. A nice story for those looking for a reminder about how to live positively - a far fetch for those seeking understanding about acute suffering.
B000B86S1Q|4.0|This book sounded sweet, and it lived up to my expectations. I'd think you'd have to believe in the concept of soul mates to really enjoy the book, though, because it is very sentimental. There really wasn't anything NOT to like about the book, but I didn't love it, maybe because I'm not as much of a romantic as Holly.
0684824906|5.0|This is a marvelous, entertaining, enjoyable master work. I was not sure another Lincoln book was necessary, especially one 754 pages long so I came close to passing on Goodwin's latest. But I expect that as soon as you begin reading you will become hooked as I was by both her approach to the subject and by her excellent writing. This is not the overly detailed tough to read writing style found in the likes of David Herbert Donald's \\"Lincoln\\" (as well worth reading as that title is). What you will discover is that Goodwin has done an amazing thing with her book. She has fashion a political biography that offers a unique and entirely new perspective by interweaving short biographies of Lincoln's major rivals for the 1960 Republican nomination.  You see Lincoln and his actions through the eyes of his peers. In addition Goodwin has also fashioned this on to a social and political history (the history of the minority parties of the time) of the United States from 1840 to 1865.  <br />The end product is a better understanding of Lincoln the politician. These rivals (William Seward, Salmon Chase, Edwin Stanton, and Edward Bates) are an interesting group as they progress during the narrative in their changing and growing assessment of Lincoln the person and his leadership. Both Seward and Chase's stories would make great biographies on their own. And maybe Goodwin's book can be read as a message to our modern day electorate that our greatest President was also our greatest Politian. And it was this quality that made him a statesman. (One can not help compare Lincoln's qualities of leadership to the current occupant's self righteous, one dimensional, ideologically driven leadership style.) I highly recommend you pick up and enjoy this new and very interesting take on the political age of Lincoln. <br />
0312323859|4.0|I'll be the first to admit I was skeptical about reading this book. I didn't like Darcy in Somthing Borrowed, so I couldn't imagine spending an entire book listening to her. I really liked the beginning of the book, and everything that happened with Darcy in New York. When she moved to London I thought the story became a little predictable and sort of glossed over a bunch of stuff (the relationship with the doctor, her two new friends, her lack of career). It didn't seem as interesting as everything that happened back in New York and Darcy's transformation didn't really seem like a transformation to me. Sure, she became more likeable. In any case, I still enjoyed the book way more than I thought I would, but I would still recommend the first book first.
0553801503|5.0|I understand that those who didn't follow the progress of the book would have been upset to learn that some of our favourite characters don't make appearances in FEAST. However, speaking as someone who had followed George R R Martin's updates and was expecting such, I loved the new book. <br /> <br />One of the other reviewers mentioned, \\"This book is what its title promises... the quiet of a finished battle, the descending flock of crows and ravens, the survivors limping back to their homes.\\" <br /> <br />Just so. <br /> <br />You won't fine show-stopper scenes like the Red Wedding and Tyrion's escape, true. But you will find beautiful, nostalgic scenes such as Prince Doran watching blood oranges fall in 'The Captain of The Guards', or Arya's truly magnificent chapter, 'Cat of the Canals' where we are introduced to all the intimacies of Braavos... written so perfectly that you'll feel like you yourself are walking in its streets. Jaime's chapters are also a delight, especially as we are introduced to some hilarious new Lannister relatives, as are Sansa's as we see more of Littlefinger's cunning brilliance. Sam's are also interesting... notably every word that escapes Maester Aemon's mouth. <br /> <br />The only thing I was disappointed at was the Iron Islands character POVs. I have no sympathy for these people. I have no interest in these people. <br /> <br />The first 'Dorne' POV was superb, but the subsequent chapters lacked... if only because Arys is such a weak, dislikeable character, and Arianne acts like a foolish child, possibly even more dislikeable than her lover. However, never fear, as the superb Prince Doran and his sidekick Areo Hotah will make these chapters bearable. <br /> <br />The writing was as witty, as sharp, as funny as ever. Jaime especially had some classic, laugh-out-loud one-liners. <br /> <br />Another thing I loved about the book was the hidden intricacies... the secrets. You really HAVE to read this book closely. For example, the prologue and the continuation of it with Sam's last chapter was not all that it seemed, as was a certain gravedigger, and it took me a couple of reads to figure that out. <br /> <br />It doesn't hit you in the face quite like SoS did, but it's still better than any other modern fantasy out there.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|This is a review of A) the movie B) from the perspective of a fan of the TV show C) who did not enjoy the movie. <br /> <br />I liked the Firefly TV series quite a bit.  It was fun, filled with action and adventure - a space western.  The best part was the character development during the course of the series.  Whedon really did a great job of presenting believable characters. <br /> <br />Serenity saw a radical shift in the characterization of several characters, to such a degree that it was immediately noticable.  Their behavior during the course of the movie often made little sense to me, given the history established in the TV series.  Even ignoring that I still had difficulty wrapping my brain around the \\"why\\" of some of their actions. <br /> <br />The basic plot, of a corrupt government trying to repress the truth, is the same tired paranoid Sci-FI story that has been reiterated since the birth of the genre.  The only thing that could be considered unique here is the stunning visual effects, costuming, and set design.  The movie is very pretty to look at. <br /> <br />The acting is average to bad, with some actors delivering particularly poorly.  This was a sufficient problem for me at times that I could not immerse myself in the tale being woven before my eyes.  I was painfully aware that I was watching an actor poorly deliver lines. <br /> <br />The changes made in the backstory to bring the show to the big screen were good and didn't bother me a bit.  I especially enjoyed how the movie opened up the Firefly universe a bit more and filled in some more details.  The wonky nature of a giant planetary system with so many inhabitable worlds bugged the Sci-Fi dork in me, but I doubt it bothered many other folk.  A lot of the realism strived for in the TV show was left behind for fast paced action in this movie.  While i'm sure this was a great move on the part of the developers, it took away some of what I liked most about the series. <br /> <br />The over-the-top fight sequences, while neat at first, became tired towards the end of the movie.  How much punishment can these characters take?  The entire end sequence felt forced and purposeless, with a fight that went far beyond the bounds of believability.  Mal seems more like an all powerful super soldier by the end instead of the army grunt he had previously been portrayed as. <br /> <br />It's still a good movie, and worth a watch, but like other lower quality Sci-Fi it's not something I feel the need to see again.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Peter Jackson beautifully & triumphfantly delivers \\"the Eighth Wonder of the World\\" in a visually stunning and more heart breakingly 3 hour epic. I new all along like this being the film, Jackson had been wanting to remake, I believe this is the film I was born to see. I got to see a version of Merian C. Cooper's beast from the man who directed \\"the Lord of the Rings\\" The visual effects, are amazing, the emotion is more tender than the original. It pays homage to the original and it outdoes it no doubt. Jack Black came through in a serious role, Naomi Watts & Adrien Brody were marvelous. This masterpiece most definitley should have been Best Picture, but the Academy usually doesn't go for fantasy epics except \\"the Lord of the Rings\\" but at least it won three oscars including best visual effects. Thats the best movie I've ever seen, but truly I think it is. A great director shares in his passion a fantastic story whom he brings for a generation who couldn't sit through a black & white movies, I can & I own the King Kong collection, I excited for the extended edition DVD of Kong, just like \\"the Lord of the Rings\\". I think it would awesome if Peter Jackson remade \\"Son of Kong\\" although it's only this \\"King Kong\\" that made him become a director. This a masterpiece of something of beautiful in 1933, that could be again today. It sends you to another time & strange place. Everybody get out to see the latest and greatest edition to the ape's movie changing legacy and the greatest edition to the movies itself. So hold your breath for most thrilling and most romantic fantasy Hollywood has ever known. The Essence of why movies are made. \\"Why the World will pay to see this\\" \\"Ladies & Gentlemen, I give you KONG, the Eighth Wonder of the World\\" \\"Beautiful\\" \\"I wrote it for you\\"
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|We learned about these blocks years ago when my now 13 year old was in pre-school.  I was amazed at how these seemingly simple pieces of wood, so totally enraptured these little kids!<br /><br />Kapla, are 'blocks' that are all exactly the same size.  At first glance, they seem boring.  But once you start playing with them, they are so much more.  They can be made into all kinds of structures, and can even be raised higher than one can reach, without falling!!<br /><br />When our 'surprise blessing' turned 2, I pulled them out for him.  He enjoyed them (though at 3 he likes them much more), but what surprised me is that my older two (15 and 13) love playing with them as well!!  In fact, we ALL do!!<br /><br />I know it seems like a lot of money to spend on these, but they are MORE than worth it!!

B00005JNJV|5.0|So here is Warner Brothers attempt at reviving the Batman franchise after the ridiculous cartoons that were Joel Schumacher's Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. When the original movie with Michael Keaton came out in 1989 I was a bundle of overexcited 11-year old joy. I was a huge comic book fan as a kid and Batman was always my favorite character. I loved the Tim Burton version with Keaton, but I recognized that Burton's Dark Knight was slightly different than the detective Batman of the comics, not to mention the difference in the costume. As that original series progressed, both the costume and the character of Batman devolved into silly cartoon caricatures of the dark, conflicted character of DC Comics. Fastforward to 2005 and Nolan's rebirth of the franchise with Batman Begins. Nolan understands more about the Batman mythos than either Burton or Schumacher, and the film is a thrill ride that doesn't forget to focus on the interesting internal dynamics that make up the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman. It reminds me of the fantastic Batman: Year One graphic novel in that we get to see Batman as he develops, from concept to crimefighter, in all its arcane and sometimes clumsy detail. That being said, I still feel that Nolan's Batman is slightly different than the DC Comics character. The costume still isn't right (again) and we still see very little of Batman the detective. But I don't suppose that matters a whole lot, since the heart of Batman - the conflicted yet noble idealist Bruce Wayne - is still there. The action is great without being too over-the-top, and the villains are believable and they don't take center stage over the title character as they often did in the Burton and Schumacher versions. By the way, if you want to see what a more authentic film version of a Batman costume would look like, hunt online for a fan film called \\"Batman: Dead End\\" by Sandy Collora.

If you're unlike me and you've read it 1 to 100 times before, I recommend reading this one and digging deeply into all the extra information provided. With all the archaic phrases and slang comments regarding things like locations in London, I'm uncertain how Americans over the years have truly felt as if they understood all the dialogue contained herein without the benefit of annotation.<br /><br />I (like most, I imagine) knew a rough outline of the story but I knew nothing of the details or the language and style in which the story is presented. I am so glad I finally read it, and read this version! I never could have gotten as much out of this story as I did, had the annotation not been present. I often found myself detouring from the story itself, to read the story-behind-the-story about from where Dickens grabbed this line, or what this reference had to do with London life during this era, etc...<br /><br />I picked this up at the library but there is enough information and depth in this book that I know I cannot uncover all its treasures in the time allotted from the library. In short, before I was even finished reading it, it had made its way to my \\"Books To Buy\\" list. There shall be many other books checked out, bought, read, and other topics looked into due to the notes given here. Also, for those of you who also just truly enjoy the presentation and physicality of a book, this is very nice. It has lovely reprints (color and b&w) of old drawings, engravings, covers of old editions, etc...<br /><br />This great edition also sparked me into looking for more Annotated books, hoping this was part of a series. It turns out there are Annotated Brothers Grimm, Wizard of Oz, Huckleberry Finn, etc...! I have much good reading ahead of me.
B000001GQ1|5.0|This review is probably useless but I will not allow this wonderful disc to continue its 3 and a half star rating. Sound is fine. Performances immense but in a rather understated way which rewards repeated listening as more dynamic readings will not. I feel Beethoven sonatas need clarity and transparency for maximum enjoyment. i doubt if anyone would have the nerve to suggest this is not achieved by Kempff. I could draw comparison with that other master of understatement Solomon as his Beethoven is so transparent and I recommend his Testament recordings. Kempff is no Kovacevich and vice versa but I feel one can get rather fed up with K as K stamps his own personality on such works which leads to pretty impressive listening at first but I find it is Kempff I tend to go back to. Perhaps therefore purchasers should be warned to persevere if finding the disc seems disappointing on initial listening.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|When King Kong was first released in the 1930s, people hadn't seen anything like it before.  It was a technical marvel that thrilled and chilled audiences across the nation.  In fact, some of the scenes were deemed too scary for the audience (the now famous spider sequence) and were cut.  Now, in 2005, Peter Jackson has once again shown why he is the king of the epic film by recreating pretty damn faithfully the original experience but doing something even more wonderful:  adding heart and humanity.    The original King Kong was a fiercesome beast.  From ripping heads off with disdain, ripping wings, destroying everything he touches, Kong was more monster than anything.  Sure he had an affection for Fay Wraye's character and at the end you do feel sorry for him.  But what was missing from his leering, toothy gaze was the heart that Jackson has found.  There are scenes of such humanity between Ann Darrow and Kong that you can almost forget he is a 25 foot Gorilla.  From the beginning when Ann performs Vaudeville prat falls to keep Kong from killing her to the sentimental (almost too much? But definitely needed) scene in the park, Kong is shown as a creature that can love, can feel and can be more human than monster.  You get a sense near the end that Kong has learned.  His character has progressed from the beginning.  And that makes what happens next all the more tragic and heart-breaking.      Andy Serkis who did terrific work as Gollum once again goes above and beyond in his duty as Kong.  Having studied gorillas in the habitat (involving a much maligned trip to Africa that Peter begged him not to do for safety reasons) Serkis nails Kong's behaviour patterns and thought process.  Between him and the best CG I've seen, King Kong is a beast with sadness.  You can see it in his eyes and his movements.  Perfect.      King Kong is long.  At 3 hours it is about double the original film.  How is this possible?  Well, there's more character development.  The first act is comprised of the adventurers actually reaching the island and concerns itself with developing the myriad of characters on the boat.  It also expresses the possible love that could blossom between Ann and Jack before Kong steps into the picture.  I'll admit, the first act was a bit over-long.  It was important to the film, but it got the point where I wanted something exciting to happen.      Once that exciting moment happens, though, the thrill ride begins.  What follows once they reach the island is thrilling sequence after sequence.  But unlike other movies involving dinosaurs (Jurassic Park 3), this film has emotion, characters worth caring about and heart.    I can't recommend this movie enough.  It does everything a remake should.  It is faithful to the original but builds upon it both creatively and technically.  You will laugh, you will jump and you will possibly cry at this story of beauty and the beast.      A must see.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|ROBOCOP is a modern science fiction masterpiece. The future is not black and white, as most sci-fi tales conform to. It is a utopia of white-teeth propaganda but its black tarred heart beats a dystopian horror. ROBOCOP has been misunderstood simply as an eighties violent action picture. It is a lot more than that.    Firstly, integral satire thumps hard at its core - big business is the new `democracy' (or lack of) and money is God. Falling human values and decency are humorously mocked (the family playing the `nuke' game) and the price of human life is devalued.     Robocop is a sort of iron messiah, almost Christ-like - for example, he is a morally strong man, gunned down doing something he believed in, was `resurrected' and eventually became an iconic figure for hope in a city falling into apathetic hell and crime.    The film is extremely violent, but it never seems gratuitously (there for the sake of it). The violence highlights the cold heartless vision of the future that our future relatives will inevitably inherit (are we not too far off now from that dystopia?) I saw this film on British television years ago, with censored `television-friendly' cuts. This made the film feel subdued in its message, and it lacked the brutal force of the uncut version (even the cutting of swear words gave the film a less realistic, less-grimmer feel).    Peter Weller is an inspired choice for the dual role of Officer Murphy (married family man, nice suburban home) and his resurrected entity - Robocop. The armour suit is brilliantly created, and seems well ahead of its time - example the gun holster in his leg (this is pre-CGI). Nancy Allen, plays his bolshy side-kick who also holds a high moral compass.    The stop-motion animation seems a tad dated (ED-209 falling down the stairs for example) even though it was made in 1987, but the sets are well-made and the difference between the urban decay below and the modern settings of the OCP buildings are well contrasted (the officebuildings are grey and colourless, devoid of any human touches or character).    The intertwining news features, and faux advertisements, satirise a scrupulous modern media relationship with the `consumer'.    Apparently, Paul Verhoeven wanted a futuristic city created (see Starship Troopers) but budget restrictions forced him to settle for modern day looking Dallas. This works well in Verhoeven's favour, as the city feels deprived and the overall feeling is that this bleak future is not too far off.    The sequels and the TV spin-off (aimed at kids!), fortunately, does not devalue this movie, as this film stands alone. Some say it is the greatest sci-fi to come out of the eighties, I think it is the best to come out ever (alongside Metropolis, Terminator, Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey), though people who think its gory violence is unnecessary, will disagree.
B00005JM1F|5.0|Ok, for everyone who has been searching for music from this movie, I think this might help..... The wedding singer in this movie was played by Dan Finnerty, comedian Kathy Najimy's husband.  I read an article in People about a year ago that he was putting out a CD.  I finally found it - The Dan Band, Live.  I think this will be a great addition to your collection if you were a fan of his rendition of \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\".  Everytime we hear it on the radio, my husband and I give each other the look that Frank & his wife did at the wedding.  This movie is hilarious & the music makes it even better.  Whenever we're looking for a good laugh, we watch this movie.  An instant classic!!
B000A59PMO|5.0|Believe me I don't say this lightly.  This show is that good.  If you enjoy brilliantly written scripts and perfectly cast characters, this show is for you!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I don't really watch a lot of televison, DVD's included, and my taste usually runs to sitcoms and silly comedies, not 4-hour gritty costume dramas. However, I kept hearing such good things about this adaptation so I bought it, and now having watched N&S, I can honestly say it's really one of the best films I've ever watched. I sat down and watched N&S all in one sitting and I continue to watch it over and over again, especially the ending. The ending is one of the most romantic I've ever seen (and the music is just lovely). It's beautifully filmed with great production values and acting. In particular, the actor portraying Mr. Thornton, Richard Armitage, does a wonderful job. I didn't think much of him beforehand but now he's totally crushworthy. Highly recommended.   <br />
B000BBOUU4|1.0|Hey kids, Mister Wonka just put out a new flavor! I hope you like double-glazed crapcake, because that's what it tastes like. It seems Wonka, Inc. was bought out by a glitzy Hollywood outfit that booted out all of the loveable characters, simple charm and oh-so hummable songs and replaced them with high-gloss, coldly computerized eye-candy. The oompah loompahs are all played by one ugly old man who is digitally recreated, neat trick, but a piss-poor substitute for the original hard-working wee people. Miscast Johnny Depp pales (figuratively and literally) in comparison to Gene Wilder. He plays Wonka like an old Dave Foley character from \\"Kids in The Hall,\\" but creepier and completely unlikable. Not to be an \\"older is always better\\" guy, but not one single thing in this high-tech remake is better than the original. The songs just plain stink and the kids, except for Charlie, are less than sweet simulacrums of the original stellar cast. I can't remember the book that well, but I'm pretty damn sure that Roald Dahl did not have the hackneyed story line about Wonka having \\"father issues\\" that need to be addressed and happily remedied in the last five minutes. The beauty of the original was the mystery around the factory and the enigmatic Wonka, like many simple joys, I don't need to have everything explained to me and have \\"back stories\\" shoved down my throat.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|I forgot how much I liked this movie until just watching it a 2nd time. It's quite funny and very charming. Let's face it, there are so many bad holiday movies, so it's always a welcome surprise when you find one thats as good as this one is. Plus, it's one of those rare occurences when both children and adults can watch a movie and have a good time. Watching this helped me forgive Will Ferrell for Bewitched and Melinda and Melinda, his last two movies that really stunk. He is perfect here, innocent, hilarious, very fun.<br /><br />Will Ferrell obviously has a gift for physical comedy, but his delivery in \\"elf' was right-on, his sadness when he realizes most people's X-mas spririt generally sucks was perfect, and the chemistry he has with his real father, played well by James Caan , is wonderfull. You see Buddy (Will Ferrell) was an orphan baby raised by elves, mostly by Papa Elf played perfectly dead-pan by Bob Newhart, but he feels he does not fit in with the rest of the elves so he heads to New York City to find his real dad.<br /><br />Upon arrival in the Big Apple, Buddy goes through all kinds of mis-adventures, all very funny and sometimes sweet and sappy, but thats ok here, it fits and does not feel thrown in our faces like most holiday fare. He finds his dad is on the naughty list and also helps Santa (Ed Asner, great casting by the way) get the world back into some Christmas Spirit. Buddy also finds some time to fall in love with a department store elf he works with played lovingly by Zooey Deschanel, whom I am really starting to enjoy, this is the 3rd movie I've seen her in, and I like where she is heading.<br /><br />So, great cast, lots of laughs, harmless fun, any problems you ask? Not really, Mary Steenburgen plays James Caan's wife and she  really didn't provide much, she used to be such a good actress, but as of late it seems, um, lacking....? Also at only 95 minutes, this could have been a little longer, maybe show us more Buddy trying to 'get' New York, but over-all, not a whole lot to complain about.<br /><br />So, here is the perfect night's viewing for you and your kids if you ware looking for an X-mas night 1.Elf 2.Polar Express 3.Nestor the Long-Eared Donkey 4.The Little Drummer Boy, and finish it up with It's a Wonderfull Life, I'm telling you people this is fool-proof, great viewing, I promise.<br /><br />Happy Holidays!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />acting...........4 stars, Ferrell and Caan are magnificent<br /><br />directing........4 stars, Jon Favreau (Swingers, Made) does comedies very well.<br /><br />special effects.....4 stars, X-mas settings are beautifull, as are the North Pole shots<br /><br />comedy rating......4.5 stars, I laughed alot, Bob Newhart is priceless!!!<br /><br />quality...........4.5 stars, Simple yet a joy to watcht' New York, but over-all, not a whole lot to complain about.  <br /> <br />So, here is the perfect night's viewing for you and your kids if you ware looking for an X-mas night 1.Elf 2.Polar Express 3.Nestor the Long-Eared Donkey 4.The Little Drummer Boy, and finish it up with It's a Wonderfull Life, I'm telling you people this is fool-proof, great viewing, I promise.  <br />Happy Holidays!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />acting...........4 stars, Ferrell and Caan are magnificent <br />directing........4 stars, Jon Favreau (Swingers, Made) does comedies very well. <br />special effects.....4 stars, X-mas settings are beautifull, as are the North Pole shots <br />comedy rating......4.5 stars, I laughed alot, Bob Newhart is priceless!!! <br />quality...........4.5 stars, Simple yet a joy to watch
B000ASATYO|5.0|Originally, this film was supposed to have had a Halloween 1996 release date, but Universal, in its infinite wisdom, elected to shift the release date into the summer - probably because of the awesome special effects.  Unfortunately, the summer of '96 was dominated by ID4 and its city-destroying effects, which left the ghosts of Peter Jackson's The Frighteners spinning in the dust.  I didn't think much of the film then. <br /> <br />I remained aloof until one night two or three years ago; I was up late, just flipping through the channels, when I just happened to run across this film.  I recognized it, and seeing as nothing else was on, decided to give it a chance.  Needless to say, I enjoyed it.  It had quirky humor blended with horrific dark elements; the blending is done in such a clever way that it never completely loses either element, yet the tension is ratcheted up by shifting from more humor in the beginning to more horror towards the end.  The film really walks a fine line, and it does so beautifully. <br /> <br />Being so impressed, I had to have it on DVD, and within a few weeks of that late night viewing, I had the original DVD release.  Happy as I was to have the film, I was somewhat dissappointed by the lack of special features and, knowing it was from Peter Jackson - the man behind LOTR and the bevy of supplemental materials those films had on their DVD releases - somewhat surprised.  I figured it must have been due to the film's poor box office, and assumed a more comprehensive release was out of the question. <br /> <br />I am pleased to say I was wrong, and this new Director's Cut DVD edition is the answer to any desires I might have had for a better release.  A full 14 minutes has been restored to the movie, there's a full-length commentary by Jackson, storyboards, a trailer...but, by far, the best thing about this disc is the 3 hour and 45 minute documentary on the second side.  It is the most comprehensive special feature I have ever seen, and considering I managed to watch it all in one sitting, it's also one of the most enjoyable.  It's very in-depth and virtually any question one might have had about the making of the film is sure to be answered within.  Regardless of the other features, the upgrade to this disc is worth it for the documentary alone. <br /> <br />I whole-heartedly recommend a purchase.
B0006A9FMI|3.0|DVD: <br />Well, to reiterate on what some of the other reviewers wrote, I agree completly. Dreamworks COMPLETLY messed this DVD up, I personaly depsise american voice acting with Animes and prefer the subtitles so that was not an issue to me, however the lack of the english sound track was sort of a representation of what dreamworks was getting at, a fast release so they could make money faster. Also the subtitles were distracting at times, subtitling noises rather then the actual vocals, also I noticed a fairly large amount of dialog that was shortend up and simplified, I know some Japanese, although not much and was able to see almost entire conversations missing or replaced with some dumbed down dialog about the weather or something. <br /> <br />The Anime itself: <br />Akio tsuka is an outstanding artist and he did a wonderful job of bringing this anime to life. I personaly liked the first GITS since it had much more action. GITS was more into the butt kicking cyborg action with a reasonable amount of deeper thinking dialog. However GITS2 was basicly ALL deep thinking dialog. No where near enough action for my personal taste, but dont let that scare you away. This will defintly become a classic among anime fans but not to the extent of the first GITS.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Madonna returns this year with her new single 'Hung Up' and this, new album. Probably better than American Life and Music. Maybe even better than Ray Of Light, the album that was said to be her best ever.  <br /> <br />The album definatly has a good amount of songs that are single material. At first listen, 'Hung Up', 'Sorry' and 'I Love New York' will probably appeal most. After a while you will realise 'Let It Will Be', 'Future Lovers' and 'How High' are just as good. Those are probably the best tracks on the album. The only weaker track, to me, is 'Push'. It reminds me of her last album, American Life, which wasn't that good really, in my opinion.  <br />A good thing about the album is that all the tracks are connected, which makes the album easy to listen to, and makes the album seem very complete.  <br />People who think she sings the same dance-a-like-songs that she had in the beginning of her career are wrong. Electronics, instruments and lyrics have evolved, and it gives this album a whole new face. <br /> <br />Worth buying, for sure.
B000001ELF|5.0|BEST Kiss lp and one of the best 70's lps.Although Ace never lived up to this again.
B00000064G|5.0|this is hands down my favorite album ever.  there isn't one single song that is short of amazing. <br /> <br />never has such an accurate portrayal of the human experience and condition been recorded. <br /> <br />nick drake was an amazing talent.  damn this world for ruining him.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|The Copyright thing sux alot... despite that the music is amazing. A new feel and I think its totally original, it's def. a step up from their debut. Jared Leto is awsome, this band is  one of my favs by the release of \\"A Beautiful Lie.\\" I saw them live and they were insane, buy this album if you like the techno, space, rock music kinda like Deadsy and Crossbreed.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Reviewing this disc, even in its reissued form, seems almost beside the point. Surely everyone knows by now the music contained therein, its significance, and whether or not it's for them...It is, decidely, for me...From the opening \\"invitation\\" (as Bruce describes it) of the beautiful piano arpeggio voicings beginning \\"Thunder Road\\" to the somber, funereal ending strains of \\"Jungleland\\", the intelligence, and artistry and emotion are apparent in every note...(Okay, there is one weak spot: \\"Night\\". It's 2nd rate Springsteen, but this is such an awesomely powerful musical juggernaut, its momentum doesn't falter at all)...<br /><br />The remastering is nice - I definitely can discern musical information that was not there before - it's crisper, sharper, and there's more spatial definition.<br /><br />And of course, the DVDs are the real news here. Particularly, the huge find the Hammersmith Odeon concert represents. This is just magnetic, dynamite footage of the Boss plying his trade, and it very handily provides visual testament to Bruce's vaunted reputation as a performer....<br /><br />The making-of doc is quite nice, too, with tons of great interviews and breakdown of tracks.<br /><br />So...the bottom line is, if you don't own this album, you should, and this is the version to get, or alternately, even if you do own it already, you still need this.
B000B5IPDI|5.0|It's funny that despite films like Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands on his resume, Tim Burton is always known as director behind Batman and its sequel, Sleepy Hollow and Beetlejuice, very dark gothic films. So it's quite surprise to see Big Fish, not only because it's tonally different but also cause it's good.<br /><br />Will is trying to figure out the kind of man his father is, only problem is his father is Edward Bloom. He's particularly known for telling wild stories to the point where they become just mere fairytale-like which is exactly what Will hates. So before Ed dies, Will wants to know his dad once and for all.<br /><br />In flashback mode, Edward as a young kid got a glimpse into his death by means of a witch with a magical glass eye. So he decides what anyone would probably do: go nuts and explore the world. His adventures find himself finding a colorful town, in the war, meeting the girl of his dreams from the moment he first saw her and being his own boss. He ends up meeting a wild assortment of characters including a really big giant, a Ron Jeremy look-alike circus runner and a poet.<br /><br />It's quite a change from film like Sleepy Hollow but his trademark visual style is still here. I think what sets this fim apart from other films with similar set design is that here it feels natural and not too flashy. Meanwhile something like Chocolate Factory where yeah it was really vibrant but it felt rather plastic oddly enough, as if it was designed solely to get a rise out of people. Here it falls in naturally.<br /><br />Acting-wise is pretty straight across the board. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney do great jobs as young and old Edward Bloom and always dependable and cutie Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange plays his love Sandra. The rest of them are kind of one-note but they're endearing anyway so we don't really mind.<br /><br />For people wondering whether it's worth the double dip if you have the original, ask yourself one question: do you want a book? Because that's pretty much what this release does that's different. It's a book filled with artwork. The DVD is essentially the same, probably right down to its packaging too(I didn't buy the old one).<br /><br />If you're a big fan of Edward Scissorhands, you'll probably get into this one. For all others, give it a try. Might surprise you.want a book? Because that's pretty much what this release does that's different. It's a book filled with artwork.

B00006V9A0|5.0|You can argue about what was included, or the necessity and/or appropriateness of compilations, but the fact remains: this is a staggering display of artistic greatness. Extra points for succinctness - I am a big enough fan to have bought the box set, and frankly, I don't find myself listening to it. Too spotty and much of the sound quality is off. I find myself, instead, pulling this out - it's way more rewarding and enjoyable.
B000BVD460|5.0|Alright. Something I will never understnad is why people who hate Eminem must insist on writing negative reviews as if they are going to convince fans. Look, just because you rate an album one or two stars, doesn't mean that you are magically going to change someone's opinion about music. The whole point of reviewing is to provide someone else who has similar interests to see if the CD is worthwhile. That being said, I'm sure that anyone browsing this CD already owns some of Eminem's previous CDs or has heard his songs on the radio. This is a greatest hits package, so every song that was on the radio or talked about in the media is on here. New songs are included as well, like \\"When I'm Gone\\", which is a great song. If you are a casual fan and dont want to buy every album and end up with a lot of filler, this is a good buy. Sure it's not ground-breaking hip-hop or even really \\"music\\", but its fun and different. Thank You... <br />
B0000256VK|5.0|...but, in a good way. Bryan Ferry's extremely mellifluous voice is seductive, almost narcotic...it's that addictive, too. This disc shows him and RM getting all the elements in place - it's well-nigh perfect and many of their most beloved tunes are here, including \\"More Than This\\" (covered by Bill Murray to humorous, but poignant effect) and the title cut.
B0002S947K|5.0|What more do need to say? This album is truly wonderful, with great melodies, lyrics and performance. The strength, I feel, is in the fact that the music is so straight forward, a guitar, some bass, drums and vocals. <br /> <br />Buy this album.
0765310015|1.0|I picked up this book, the first in a projected series of ten, because everyone was giving it glowing reviews.  Wherever I looked I saw nothing but great things being said about it.  So I bought the first three in the series, intending to read them all while on holiday. <br /> <br />What I discovered was that the book was awful. <br /> <br />I have seen people saying that Steven Erikson can really write.  He's not particularly bad, but he isn't fantastic either. <br /> <br />What actually makes this book fall flat, though, is the magic.  It's vague (we get wizards killing people with \\"a wave of sorcery\\", not fireballs or ice storms or lightning), and it is not explained.  There is absolutely no text about how and why the magic works.  It's just there, and in massive ammounts. <br /> <br />There's also this vague impression that there's some \\"normal\\" mages floating about, but we never get to see them.  Every single character who we're introduced to is somehow special.  They can access seventeen types of magic, rather than the usual one or two, or they can fight at lightning fast speeds, or they've been altered by a magical object.  It's like a comic populated entirely by superheroes, with no ordinary people for them to save. <br /> <br />And finally, there's the gods.  Like the Greek Gods, they are driven by entirely mortal wants and needs.  However, they appear to be all powerful, and locked in a constant struggle for power.  What isn't clear, though, is what many of the Gods wants.  Oponn, for instance, is one of the major players in this book, but as the God of Luck, doesn't appear to have any particular motivation except to cause random events.  A character who has a massive impact on the plot and has no actual goal?  Can you see the problem there? <br /> <br />The result of all this is a plot that doesn't follow any kind of logical pattern.  Many of Erikson's fans seem to think that this makes the book somehow pleasantly unpredictable, the way George RR Martin'sbooks are. <br /> <br />But Martin's plot twists occur when characters decide to do things which, while they may not be expected, are entirely believable given those characters' personality and motivations.  Erikson's plot twists often involve a supremely powerful character suddenly appearing and using magic to alter events, often for no apparent reason, or at least no foreshadowing whatsoever.  Similarly, when faced with problems, his characters usually have some inexplicable magical means to overcome it. <br /> <br />And this happens a lot.  A whole lot.  The plot doesn't twist and turn, it more or less bounces randomly around. <br /> <br />The ending is possibly the worst part of the book.  While everything else is in constant flux, there are two plots that are constant throughout the book.  The raising of a terrible monster from it's prison, and the diabolical mission of a possessed assasin-girl.  However, at the last minute, the monster is recaptured before it can actually do anything, and the assassin girl is released from her possession, mission unaccomplished. <br /> <br />Instead, we get a completely random demon for some final dramatic action, and an entirely new group of superhero characters appearing in the final chapter to save the day.  What? <br /> <br />A year later I tried again and tackled the second book in this series, \\"The Deadhouse Gates\\", on the promise that it was far better.  It wasn't, it suffered from the same ridiculous plot twists and (still) unexplained magical metaphysics. <br /> <br />I gave up about halfway through when, it the midst of a pitched battle, it is suddenly revealed that the battle just happens to be taking place on the site of some heretofore unmentioned prior battle, and the mages raise the corpses of those long-dead soldiers to provide reinforcements of undead. <br /> <br />That isn't storytelling, that's just pulling something out at the last minute to explain why your vastly outnumbered force of good guys manages tobeat the bad guys.
B000BVD460|1.0|his first 2 were his best then he fell off..this is an alright collection of his greatest hits but it shoul have been a double disc...eminem has fell off...the only reason he gets 1 star is cause of the couple songs that are good...about 3 or 4 of them....otherwise its not too good...its more of a radio hits cd then a greatest hits cd...if there is more after this then lets hope this is the final bow
B0000X61VE|5.0|I've actually been using the workout since I was a sophomore in high school in preperation for a beauty pageant, in which I won swimsuit competition and I solely credit this workout--I'm 30 now and have wore out 2 of the VHS tapes and am now on the DVD. I actually hate working out but this DVD gets me motivated. With the 3 workout options, I can use it daily without getting bored and still feel the burn. I've had better results on my legs, buns, abs and arms with this than with any of the other workout videos/dvd's--I'm not sure if it's because I couldn't stick with those other workouts, or if trainer Radu is right on target. I'm still devoted 13 years later!
B000BMSTMS|2.0|I normally dont write reviews but after reading that pisser review I had to comment. That would be funny if that kid reviewer he yelled at was actually a kid. I was looking at pisser's other reviews and he doesn't seem to actually like anything he reviews except for Metallica(lol). He also seems to like calling everyone he reviews gay, hmm. I write this because I disagree with his comment on the band in general, they WERE a great band and very distinguishable from mainstream, and its nice to see them try something different even though I didn't really like it.  <br />  Well I suppose pisser is going to write an angry review about me now, Oh well, I had to comment on his review so it was worth it. Don't worry pisser I'm not gay, I dont have dreadlocks, and I'm not mallcore I just listen to music I sample on here, and I try to sample everything in the hard rock/metal category. And about the album, it was ok, I really only liked \\"throw me away\\", but what do you expect with a band who is experimenting with a new sound and lost a band member.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|A very faithful remake, this new Kong has only a few subtle differences in the main story as its '33 counterpart. Mainly that Jackson takes alot more time to tell everything, and set everything up. It does take awhile to get to skull island and to the title character, but the film ends up being alot better as a result.     Jackson opens the movie in \\"Hooverville\\" in Central Park during the depression and gives us small glimpses at what life was like during that time. We meet Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts in an outstanding, oscar-worthy performace)performing stage comedy before her theater is closed down, and all her close friends disband, leaving her alone and unemployed. We meet Carl Denham (Jack Black in a mad-scientist type role) as he is about to lose funding for his latest feature film, and his deliberate conning of everyone around him (including Ann, and screenwriter Jack Drischol, played by oscar winner Adrien Brody) to get off to sea and basically steal an opportunity to strike it rich. He has this look in his eye during the whole movie that suggests he's a little psychotic.    They finally arrive at Skull Island in what seems to be fate (I'll let you see what I mean), and they barely survive a first encounter with the natives on the island, who are portrayed alot more hostile and violent in this version than in the previous 2 versions...but I think it works alot better. The natives kidnap Ann, and tie her up and put her out for Kong to get. And then the big man arrives.    The look of this entire scene will stay with you for along time. Its dark, and red and orange and just very creepy and unsettling. Kong arrives, and you really only get blurred glimpses at him until he gets into the jungle, and when you do finally see him your absolutely convinced he's real, and not a CGI creation by Weta digital. The amount of detail on him is amazing, especially in his facial expressions. He IS a real ape, and a real flesh and blood character!!!    I mean you look at him andhe has personality, a soul... a CGI character who obviously has a soul!!! He is great. He has a lazy eye, scars, and a re-healed, slightly crooked jaw. I mean he has traits! He's somewhat childlike when he plays with Ann. He throws tantrums, he laughs for the wrong reasons, he has expression and wonder about him. He's curious about her, and you can tell he's really trying to connect with her after awhile, but its hard. And not just because he's and ape, but because he is so utterly, miserably alone.    And all this is good, because the movie hinges on this relationship between Kong and Ann, and both Kong and Naomi Watts are amazing in this capacity. Its mostly unspoken, all the acting going on (with both of them) in the eyes and expressions, and it is magic. It is amazing, and very very touching and poignant. You understand why Kong would fall for Ann, because Jackson films her so beautifully, and because Naomi Watts is an amazing actress who had better at least get nominated for this performance. It is something special.    Moving along now, Skull Island brings a faster paced movie for along time with Dinosaurs and creepy crawlers everywhere. Nothing can prepare you for how amazing and thrilling watching Kong fight off 3...yes 3 T-Rex's to protect Ann. It is incredible, and beyond words to try and explain. Then comes the moment where Denham realizes all he can do to try and save the mission and his reputation and to not go to jail is to capture kong.    It is a really sad and emotional scene. Jack \\"saves\\" Ann from Kong and he pursues them to the natives village where Denham has a trap waiting. Ann begins to realize what they're going to do and your heart starts racing. You care alot more about Kong than Denham or any of the other people, except Ann, and your heart just brakes in two watching them attack Kong when all he wants is to get to Ann, who he thinks is in danger. She cries and pleads with them to stop and leave him alone, but the giant ape falls and his eyes meet Ann's and she looks away in pain and shame.    Course all of this is nothing compared to the finale, which is so much more emotional and sad and well done in Jacksons version. Kong runs amok in NYC trying to find Ann, who finds him first and he runs into Central Park holding her in his paw. He slips on the ice, and begins playing with Ann, spinning around in a beautiful, touching, and heartbreaking scene. Its so adorable, the connection these two have, and you believe every second of it. Its beautiful, but also heartwrenching because we know whats about to happen, we know the fate of our beloved ape-friend. And although we're happy at this quiet moment of happiness that Kong enjoys just before the climb, it makes watching it even worse.    The moment is disrupted suddenly by a tank blast onto the ice where Kong and Ann are, and Kong scrambles to get away and to protect Ann, and he leaps onto the rooftops and towards the empire state building and his doom. Personally my eyes never dried up during the last 10-13 minutes, because its so sad how they treat him. He gets to the top of the Empire State Building and looks over the early dawn sunrise.     The clouds tell you what is coming, the sadness, the tragedy. Kong touches his chest as he looks out, and mouths silently something, but Ann realizes he's immitating what she herself did on Skull Island earlier. She had looked out over a sunset, and touched her own chest and said \\"beautiful\\". No sooner does Ann tearfully smile and say to kong \\"yes...beautiful\\" then the sound and then the images of the Bi-planes arrive and Kong begins growling. Ann realizes what is happening, and so do we. Its fate, its unavoidable. Kong lowers Ann to a safe spot and gets to the very top so they don't shoot at her. Ann climbs up and futily tries to stop them, but its too late and humans are too hateful of what they don't understand. Kong begins to slip, and grabs Ann one last time and the sad, lonely eyes of the mighy King meets Annseyes for the final time. He puts her down and his eyes go blank and he falls.    Denham closes the picture the same as the '33 version; \\"It wasn't the planes who killed him...it was beauty.\\"    This movie is epic in everyway. Its amazing, thrilling, well acted, and very emotional. It shows the best and worst of humanity, and its told to us by a 25 foot tall ape named Kong. Its a movie that shouldn't be missed, and that will become and remain a classic for a long, long time.
0385507755|4.0|James Frey's story of his recovery from a heavy addiction to alcohol and drugs is truly an eye opening story.  Frey describes his intense struggle to become sober after years of drug and alcohol abuse and gives the reader an intense view into the life and recovery of an addict.  <br /> <br />Frey starts off his story not as you would think.  He doesn't describe the times he was high, or the times he was feeling good on drugs, he starts his book at his rock bottom.  Finding himself on a plane with severe wounds on his face, missing teeth, and no knowledge of where he was or how he got there.  He then goes into the struggles of his treatment, how he came to finally agree to stay at the institute, his befriending of fellow addicts, and the  various stages of his recovery. <br /> <br />This book, in my opinion, was very well written.  Although it was in a total style of it's own.  Frey doesn't focus on structure or on common writing style.  He writes it as you would expect from the mind of a recovering addict, the repetition and diction add to the emotion behind the book.  Reading through the stages of Frey's recovery you can almost imagine being in his situation.  The scene when was having his dental surgery without anesthetics or pain medications caused me to feel almost as Frey did during the procedure. <br /> <br />I personally never had any interest in the use of drugs, but I'm sure this story would make anyone think twice about their choice.  The amount of pain and suffering, the intense dreams he has during detox, the isolation he feels, and the worthlessness he endures throughout the experience show the horror and pain, the evil of drug and alcohol abuse.  <br /> <br />Although it was quite long, I believe Frey needed every word to depict his struggle through recovery.  I can't say I enjoyed reading the book because it isn't the \\"feel good\\" type of book.  It's one that will make you think, make you wonder about your life and how you live it.  This was an exceptional read and i look forward to reading more from James Frey!

0440211727|4.0|This book is a must read if you like Grisham. It really grabs you right away and is hard to put down. Likeable characters and an extremely well written book makes a Time to Kill one of the most refreshing books i've read in awhile.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked was the musical that I had never heard of.  Men doing repair work on our house wanted to thank us for being so cooperative when they had to stay four extra months constructing.  So they bought us tickets to see some new musical called Wicked.  Well, I had never heard of it, but BOY was I glad I did! I have now seen it three times, have the soundtrack on my i-Tunes and i-Pod, and play the soundtrack in my CD changer whenever I have the change.  I fell quickly in love with Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenowith's voices, and as much as Popular made me laugh, I'm Not That Girl made my cry, and Defying Gravity made me gape as I saw it on stage.  It is an amazing musical, and the album is nothing less.
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend has become one of the most talented people in the music industry with this album.  This man can not only sing, but he  can also play the piano to a T in this cd.  This is one of the best R & B cds ive ever heard.  In my eyes it's up there with Usher's COnfessions.  If he continues putting out music like this, he will be one of the best R & B artists of all time.  There were a few songs that just blew me away: <br /> <br />USED TO LOVE YOU:I think that this song is a great song.  Its not just a typical R&B song, and his voice is really good in this song.  wouldve been better if kanye west had a couple of lines in it  4.5/5 <br /> <br />SHE DONT HAVE TO KNOW:  I really liked this song.  Once again its not the typical song.  I love the lyrics, and the production on this song is great. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />I CAN CHANGE: THis song could have been a single for him.  Its a great song, the production is great, and it really helps that the one ad only SNOOP DOGG is featured on this song.  5/5 <br /> <br />ORDINARY PEOPLE: words cant describe how unbelievable this song is, so ill just leave it at that.  10/5 <br /> <br />SO HIGH:  I love this song also, i think that once again the production is great.  His voice blew me away in this song, and the lyrics were great.  The piao sounded great in this song just like it did in the rest. 5/5 <br /> <br />I recommend to all people to buy this cd.  John Legend is on his way to becoming a legend if he continues with such great music.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|With all the hype over this movie, I was ready for anything while watching this. And I got it. Anything and everything. <br />So far as film making goes....this is boldly different. <br />The stories meld well together, although for me, there was too much Mickey Rourke and not enough Bruce Willis. Jessica Alba was gorgeous in black and white, as was Rosaria Dawson. Sexy! <br />Yummy violence, I liked the story telling, and I liked The imagery of it all, especially \\"that yellow bastard\\". <br />A really refreshing, really good film. Top 3 of all time.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Magnificent, glorious, a masterpiece. I have still to digest all I have seen and experienced. This movie has been a labour of love and it shines. They dont do movies like this anymore. Packed with everything. Beautiful. Stunning. This is what Jurassic Park should have been. Go see it.

B000000993|5.0|Not every song's a winner, but they definitely impressed me with their chunky guitar, catchy vocals & videos, & their adventurous sound. Not until I read Maynard's lyrics did I realize how dark this album is, but his approach is very healthy and purging. Tool set a tone and a standard with this album that many people are still trying to copy. \\"Prison Sex\\" and \\"Sober\\" are great songs.

B00009V7RF|5.0|Elephunk~ Black Eyed Peas is a great album with great production value.  I love the samples, vocals and the vibe of this great album. The lyrics are well written but the decision not to include the lyrics is weak. Apart from this, the book-let is very well done and I love the photos of the band and the font is easy on the eye. This is a great album not to miss out. Highly recommended indeed.

B00005JO1P|5.0|Even though my father is a huge fan of Johnny Cash, I didn't really start to appreciate the man's genius until the last couple years I was in college. That's when I began to see and understand how great a performer and singer Johnny Cash was. The more I learn about the man and his life, the more I am drawn to him. Cash was a man whose music was able to cross all kinds of boundaries: rich and poor, minorities and white people, good citizens and those in jail. His songs (many of his most popular tunes he didn't write) touched people where they were.  They were rooted in the toil of daily living and in the grit and grind of humanity.<br /><br />WALK THE LINE is an excellent biopic about one segment of The Man in Black's life. The movie is not a full-fledged biography. Instead, it is a shorten tale of Cash's life that tells of the love story between John R. Cash and one June Carter.<br /><br />The movie opens with Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) preparing to go on stage at Folsom County Prison to make his comeback (which all the record producers say is impossible to do at a prison). He sees a table saw and is taken back to when he was a child growing up in rural Arkansas. The childhood segment does a couple of important things for the story line. One, it shows that even as a child Cash had an infatuation with June Carter (he listens to her and her family on the radio all the time and stares at her pictures in magazines).  Secondly, it shows that from an early age, Cash knew pain--pain which made him sing like no other, but which also eventually led to his addiction to pain killers.<br /><br />The movie flashes ahead from Cash's childhood to his brief stint in the service until he finally returns home and marries his sweetheart.  Cash is a man of vision, but his wife Vivian (played by the lovely Ginnifer Goodwin) wants John to give up his dream and settle down. Through perseverance and a lot of luck, Cash and his band have the opportunity to perform for Sam Phillips, the legendary owner of Sun Records who discovered not only Johnny Cash but Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis as well. Suddenly, Cash becomes a big star.<br /><br />However, the higher his star rises, the more mixed-up becomes his personal life. Wife Vivian is just not happy with Johnny on the road so much. Johnny becomes more and more addicted to pain killers and alcohol and his childhood infatuation with June Carter turns into full-fledged grown-up love, tinged with a lot of lust.  June Carter knows better and though she connects with Cash, she knows that until he gets his act together they can't be together. The movie follows the relationship between these two until they are eventually married after an on-and-off again courtship of almost decades.<br /><br />The acting in WALK THE LINE is some of the finest in any film this year. Joaquin Phoenix, who has a higher pitched voice than many, does an excellent job of recreating the essence of Johnny Cash's tone and timber (though the real Cash had a deeper baritone/bass).  Reese Witherspoon should be able to put to rest forever all those critics who said she was nothing more than a pretty face who had no talent because as close as Phoenix is to Cash, Witherspoon seems like a cloned version of a young June Carter. The two stars aren't the only ones to shine, because the supporting cast is just as good.<br /><br />The overall tone is somewhat serious because as much as this is a love story, it is a love story about two people who lived really screwed up lives (don't we all?).  That's one of the reasons the movie (like Cash's music) is so powerful; it's real and honest and can touch people where they are.<br /><br />Cash purists can find many faults with the film. There are points that some dramatic liberties are taken. Some characters are only represented one-sided. At times the film moves slow. Despite all this, none of these things really takes away from the film or from the life of Johnny Cash. Instead, the movie augments The Man in Black and illustrates why he was able to become admired by so many and a legend in his time.he Man in Black and illustrates why he was able to become admired by so many and a legend in his time.
B00028HBKM|5.0|For having the faith and the guts to put this movie on the big screen. Mel took shots from paranoid Jews & secularists, atheists & all around God-hatin fools (like some of these weirdos giving this flick a 1-star review). <br />This movie made me able to actually see a depiction of what our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ went through in order to offer up the option of salvation from the filth & degradation of a corrupted creation. Now y'all can believe it or not. I really don't care but the choice is out there for y'all. <br />Do with it what you want. <br /> <br />Beautiful cinematography. The shots of what is supposed to be Roman Judea & Galilee are superbly done.  <br />The cast is fantastic. Caviezel will probably become the standard for any future portrayals of Jesus. The only weakness to the cast was Monica Bellucci. Bellucci was wooden & somewhat distant in her portrayal of Mary Magdalen. Perhaps being an Italian, a European, she just didn't take the religious themes of this movie seriously. So many of these Euros are decadent perverts and whatnot. For them to play a religious character is becoming so beyond them anymore.  <br />Mel you need to keep your casting pool to Eastern Europe. The western part is beat.
B000002U82|5.0|[...] DSOTM is the best floyd album because that was the album in which all the band members contributed equally/fully to their musical potential, while the later albums were dominated by roger waters, is only partially true.    in my opinion the other reason lies in the theme/concept of the album as much as in the musical contribution by all members.    DSOTM is a wistful look at life - about the centrality of money/success in industrialized societies, about the power of mercantilism, the lack of ethics in (geo)politics etc - and what man is losing out in such an unnatural environment.    albeit wistful, still it is not negative or harsh - life is difficult, but we accept it with dignity and struggle on. so there's still hope.    the visceral negativity of waters would reveal itself in the four albums which would follow - which though musically brilliant (atleast the first three) still lacks the heartfelt concern of the dark side of the moon. so while most people can identify with the general sentiment and philosophy of DSOTM, the same is not true with the other four albums. that's the reason DSOTM triumphs.
B0009UC7H0|1.0|First let me say how happy I am that the widescreen edition has finally arrived. I've never actually seen a visual turd stretched to such dimensions. I saw this as an in flight movie and I almost walked out. If you are presented with the same choice I was, forego the headphones and opt for the parachute. If you actually saw this movie and found a shred of believability in Penelope Cruz playing a Dr. for the World Health Organization than I'd like to introduce you to my Albino cousin Faye who enjoys books on tape, regurgitating food, and long walks on the beach (albeit under a tarp). I haven't seen a movie that sucked to such great heights since that gay Giraffe at the Bronx Zoo.
B0006FFRVG|5.0|Somepeople tend to compare KEANE with Coldplay. I could say KEANE is somehow inspired by Coldplay but in no way it is a B class Coldplay. This is a masterpiece debut wich contains some songs that qualifies as perfect 4 minute pop songs such as Somewhere Only We Know and Everybody's Changing. A interesting fact is that in this album there are NO GUITAR. With is great because I rather have an excellent piano playing all over than a mediocre guitar as a merely filler. The voice is so fine, so polished, so relaxing that this is a perfect album to listen to while driving, while spending time with your significant other, in the pre sleep hours or in the first hours of the morning. It will certainly lift up your mood. Oh, and by the way relaxed and polished in now way means cliche or cheesy.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Love has no rules. It happens  when we least expect it, often when we don't want it, many times when we can't handle it. It often times scares you, surprises you, shakes you down to your very core. Ennis Del Mar (a remarkable Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (an emotionally available Jake Gyllenhaal) find themselves thrown together because of a job:  forced to spend many hours together alone in the wild, tending to sheep in a remote region of Wyoming....on Brokeback Mountain. They fall in love: a love that they soon realize only lives and breathes on the mountain.<br />It's 1963, pre American involvement in the Vietnam War, post Korean War: a time in the USA when life was simple, straightforward and the lines between the sexes and sex roles were crisply drawn and severely delineated. It was a time when men and women were pigeon-holed into unrealistic modes of behavior and anyone who ventured outside of these boundaries was thought of at best, weird at worst... perverted and in many states, criminal. Ennis himself, at an early age was witness to the ugly, disgusting results of a hate crime perpetrated on a Wyoming farmer who had lived many years with his partner. In most societies he would be venerated but in 1950's Wyoming... he became a target.<br />Director Ang Lee begins this film as both Ennis and Jack are waiting outside of a building, both looking for work, both down on their luck, both avoiding each other's eyes. We know, or those of us who have read the story know, what is to happen and so unfortunately we read more into that simple scene than there really is. But with all that aside, this scene of Ennis and Jack avoiding each other, dodging each others looks, staring at the ground, kicking up the dirt is nonetheless rife with sensuality and tension.<br />Ennis and Jack are inexorably drawn to each other through their proximity, loneliness and through a shared lack of tenderness and emotion in their lives: they are emotionally, physically and psychically bonded almost from the start. It is inevitable. It is Fate.<br /> And so begins a Love affair that transcends social mores, time, marriages, children, extra-marital affairs and divorce.<br />Despite all that is going on in their lives, Ennis and Jack meet several times a year up on Brokeback mountain  and  rekindle and thereby re-ignite their emotional and physical attraction: there is no one around, they are free from their regular lives...they can love.<br />Much has been made of Heath Ledger's performance as Ennis and he gives what is without a doubt one of the finest performances of this year. Ennis is a quiet, stoic man and he is troubled and frankly scared by how deeply he feels for Jack. As he showed us first in \\"Monster's Ball,\\" Ledger is capable of digging way deep down into his gut and imbuing his performances with an unflinching frankness and truth that we can neither ignore nor help to be moved by.<br />Gyllenhall's Jack is the younger of the two: he's fun, he's a little crazy and unfortunately he wants a lot, lot more than Ennis is able to give him. Gyllenhaal's hang-dog, frisky puppy of a performance is full of warmth and light: the kind of transcendent light that shines out from a soul full of love, understanding and acceptance.<br />\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is devastating in both its presentation, its performances and its tragic denouement. This movie is not for everyone. But if you are willing to open up your heart and mind a bit to let in its beauty, emotionality and sensuality you will not be disappointed.

076790382X|2.0|I was severely disappointed in this book, as I am a huge fan of Mr. Bryson's work. I've read Made in America, so I know that he can write about America in a critical, but loving way, not in the absolutely nasty tone of this work. Bitch, bitch, bitch, his wife says, and I'm inclined to agree with her. Not to mention the number of thing he simply gets WRONG. I felt like throwing the book down after reading the bit about lawyers and lawsuits. Everyone can agree that lawsuits are a big problem, but the example of a chemical accident in Richmond was really not the way to go. News flash Mr. Bryson, we in Richmond live in between two major oil refineries. About two years after the incident you described, we had another accident. Pollution and asthma are rampant. And we can't all move to Hanover, as it's very poor and crime-ridden here. Love how he didn't talk about any of the serious problems in America either. So, in summation, if you like Bill Bryson and you know anything about America, don't read this book. It will only ower your opinion of the man.
B000002J6F|5.0|I know this album so very well, I can play all of the songs on guitar, bass and pedal steel. I was lucky enough to see them live when they were on tour so many years ago, and it was like being in another time zone, on another planet. This album proves, once and for all, that Stills and his bandmates can really cook, and they did on this original double-vinyl album. The country rock sides are superb, with guest visits by Byron Berline on fiddle, and Chris Hillman playing some fine mandolin work. Al Perkins is on pedal steel and guitar, they all sing, and Fuzzy Samuels and righteous Joe Lala keep the rhythm section percolating with high energy. Hillman mentions on the CSN boxed set, that Stills was fun to play with, and when they \\"were on it\\" on certain nights during the 1972 touring of yesteryear, they were a force to be reckoned with. I always thought it was Stills' best band to work with, independent of Crosby, Nash and Young. In those years, Stills was going through a hard time with breaking up with Judy Collins, and it shows in his classic \\"And So Begins the Task.\\" He also pays tribute to Jimi Hendrix and some of the country blues masters with his album-ending \\"Blues Man.\\" When I saw them live, they had a huge mirror-ball glistening overhead while playing \\"The Treasure,\\" and it was like being inside a country-opry house with rock music blaring expertly to all parties concerned. A highly recommended album for Stills' lovers. Stephen remains to this day, one of the most underated guitar players alive on the planet. This album shows off his wordsmithing skills his dominant guitar licks, and a band that simply smokes all the way through the album. Five stars, indeed! -James
B000002JS6|3.0|This is a good cd, but not my favorite by AC/DC at all. The album has it's moments, but there are some songs that are weak, so this album gets what it deserves from me, and it deserves 3 stars. AC/DC is one of my favorite bands, but this album is their weakest album. It is still an album that I can enjoy very much. Lots of people do give this 5 stars, I don't. Everybody has a different taste ofcourse, so don't get angry now. I do recommend this album if you like hardrock/metal, but if you are new with AC/DC you should not buy this one first.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|This remake of King Kong is an excellent motion picture. Leave it to the visionary director, Peter Jackson, to give the beloved, big ape emotional elements. Up front, Kong displays himself as an invincible conqueror; however, in solitude, Kong is pensive and frustrated, communicating to the audience that his version of being at the top is very lonely. <br /> <br />Along with the passionate interplay that would connect the movie with the viewer, there is plenty of breathtaking action to keep the audience entertained. Included are great fighting scenes between Kong and prehistoric creatures that exist on the island where he is discovered. Chase scenes are rather manic and are so well graphically choreographed that one can only recall the amazement and wonder of the enhanced DTS visual and sound effects brought forth by Stephen Spielberg when he presented to the world Jurassic Park twelve years ago. <br /> <br />As you would expect from a big budget epic movie, the cinematography is great, and the acting is top-notch. Those who have appreciated the likes of Jack Black, Naomi Watts, and Adrien Brody will not be disappointed. Mountainous landscapes are prevalent and the display of the New York City skyline circa early 1930's, especially when Kong is on top of the Empire State Building, is quite remarkable. <br /> <br />The screenwriting for this adaptation is also excellent. The movie does get off to a rather slow start, but the pace is adequate for character development, something that I thought was a little off in the nonetheless excellent Chronicles of Narnia.  <br /> <br />All in all, Lord of the Rings was a difficult act to follow, I'm sure, but Peter Jackson has created yet another directorial triumph. One might criticize the so-called highly publicized fluff, namely, the big budget, the enhanced special effects, the top-notch cast, and the name, Peter Jackson, but there is plenty of substance in this classic remake/retelling, unlike some big-budget movies such asVan Helsing.

B000BW7QWW|1.0|This movie was soooooooooooooooo boring. If this was based on the TV series, I am glad it got canceled.
B000002572|5.0|This is a masterpiece; EVERY song is terrific.  Maybe one of the best rock CDs ever made?  Quite possibly.   Recommendedddddddd.
B00005J6T1|5.0|I love this album, and it is a must have for any fans of 1980's rock music or Madonna in general. This just may be my favourite album she has done in the 80's and the 80's is the era when Madonna was at her best. Madonna showcases herself as a Rock chick with this album, and that feel is very present on the record. Madonna had plenty of commercial appeal and that is very present on this album, even the cover art looks great. The album was recorded with Sire in 1983. Madonna had five singles from the album,   \\"Lucky Star\\", \\"Borderline\\", \\"Burning Up\\", \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Everybody\\". all the singles are the best tracks on the album, so it is a good buy just to get them all on one disc.    The album is short with only eight original songs on. The other three were not singles and are \\"I Know It\\", \\"Think Of Me\\" and \\"Physical Attraction\\". Two great bonus tracks were added to this Remastered version of the album, \\"Burning Up - The 12 Version\\" and \\"Lucky Star - The New Mix\\".   The new edition of this album sounds like it was just recorded yesterday and has the quality of not the original 80's recording but that of any of todays records. It is great if you want to experience some music from the early 1980's.  Below is the Track by Track rating.  1. Lucky Star.  This is my favourite song on the album, and oppitimizes 80's pop music with it's electric guitar strings and synthizisers. Madonna talks about a lover as sort of a good luck charm, and she feels lucky when they are around.\\"You must be my Lucky Star, cos' you make the darkness seem so far, and when i'm lost you'll be my guide. I just turn around and your by my side\\". The song is also about her early ambitions and lust for stardom. This is a classic Madonna song and remains so because it has stood the test of time. This album version is not the radio edit. It is the extended version and runs at 5:37.  Some people call this a Pop song, but I feel it is more Rock then pop. Brilliant track. 5/5  2. Borderline.  This song grew onme. I didnt find it as good as Lucky Star or Burning Up, but it wasnt too bad. It sounds very much 1980's,and has a good little intro, and then the beat comes on and you know its going to be a good song. It talks about a guy that Madonna wants but he won't open up to her and is pushing her love away. This version is an extended version of the radio-edit and runs at 5:20. It is quite catchy once it grows on you. 4/5  3. Burning Up.  I like this song quite a lot. It ranks right up there with her other classic 80's hits like Lucky Star, but the 12 In version is much better then this original album version because it has more feeling to it. The chorus to this song is great and the best part of it is when the electric guitars come in. It has a good bridge too. \\"Do you wanna see me down on my knees, abandoned over backwards, now would you be pleased.\\" She repeats the phrase \\"C'mon let go !\\". This song is good and very effective. Enjoyable listen. 4/5  4. I Know It.  Even though this song was not a single it is still quite effective, and catchy. The synthisizers sound good on it and you may find it stuck in your head. 3/4  5. Holiday.  This was one of Madonna's biggest singles ever and this album version sounds great. It runs at 6:10 so it is not the radio-edit version that runs at 4:04. This version sounds a little slowed down but you will still find yourself bobbing your head to it. The synthisizer parts sound cool, and it has a jazz type ending. Very good track. 5/5  6. Think Of Me.  This song has a good beat, and is fairly catchy , but nothing special. It does seem quite filler, but is worth a listen.There are some good guitar bits in it though.  3/5  7. Physical Attraction.  This song was very catchy I found. It sounds a bit lame in parts but it is fun. I couldn't get it out of my head after hearing it a few times. There is some good instrumental parts in this song and it sounds very funky, bordering between 70's and 80's disco. 4/5  8. Everybody.  I liked this song.This is her closest 70's sounding song, and is pure disco. I didn't like it as much as other tracks on the album but it wasn't bad. The middle part which is instrumental is a good part in the track. Overall this song is worth a listen. 4/5  9. Burning Up - The 12 In Version.  This is one of the albums best tracks. This is my Second favourite after Lucky Star. This is 80's music at its best.   This song was one of the most enjoyable on the album. Warner Bros made the right choice including this as a bonus track on the Remastered edition of \\"Madonna\\". This version of the song sounds a little bit like a New Order track, and is a great Rock song. I already had the 8 track version of this album, but I went out and bought this version of it because I heard the sound clip of this song on Amazon.com's music sampler.  I did not regret this buy, and this track alone made the buy worth it. 5/5  10. Lucky Star - The New Mix.  This remix sounds a lot like the original version except it echoes a lot which makes it sound more 1980's. This version is better then the original version, and makes the Remastered edition of this album worth the buy. 5/5  ...So what are you wating for ?. Buy yourself a copy from Amazon.com
B000BMSTMS|5.0|ok so they have been though so much within the 2 years but look at this the loss of a band member(again)and they are still puting out good things....ive been a fan of them sience i can remeber and they have NEVER gone down to all of u who think they have need to liten to the cd a few more times...it will click with all of u guys just wait and if u dont get it then you shouldnt be listing to them anyways......
B000ASATZ8|4.0|<br />Seems like all trilogys (and series that extend to quadrilogys) suffer with one bad film in the series Or perhaps there is a film thats nowhere up to the standard of the rest.In my opinion series like aliens/ Terminator /godfather /robocop all have this problem.Tremors though i think is unique all the films are good. <br />I personally had never seen or heard about tremors 3 or 4 until they came out on satelite.So i thought they <br />were going to be some dreadful straight to dvd movies thankfully thats not the case there both good movies. <br /> <br />I think the only real problem with the tremors movies (particulary in tremors 3) is when they use CGI for the graboids.They just do not look right.Also when people have to act infront of non existent monsters then there never as convincing as acting infront of something more physical like a <br />a proper made monster. <br /> <br />Overall  a great series.But i think more effort could have been made for the dvd release.There are a few making of's and a <br />commentary on tremors 4 but thats pretty much it.One thing i did not like was tremors 1 was censored <br /> <br />Still worth getting though
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I never thought I'd say this, but Peter Jackson's film surpasses the 1933 original in every way.  There is greater depth to the characters, particularly Kong himself, who (finally) looks like a real mountain gorilla.  Naomi Watts as Ann, along with this captivating, charismatic Kong, are the real stars of the film.  Sure, it's got dazzling special effects, nearly non-stop action, and makes 3 hours seem like 90 minutes, but all of that aside, this is just a terrific, entertaining movie.  The only possible negative is the casting of Jack Black as Carl Denham and the re-invention of that character as a rogue without heart or conscience (Robert Armstrong's performance and his character in the original film were far more appealing and compelling).  Jackson must be given the highest praise for capturing the kind of magic movies offered when the original King Kong premiered during the Great Depression.  While employing modern film making techniques, which were not available in 1933, he has not lost sight of the need to put a heart into his film -- and this one has a very large heart, which transcends all of the jaw-dropping technology.  Jackson has made his own masterpiece while, thankfully, paying high tribute to the original.  We can be grateful to Merian C. Cooper for creating this story and his team for first putting it on the screen during the infancy of talking pictures, and to Peter Jackson for resurrecting it so magnificently.  I can't wait to see it again.
B000B0WODA|1.0|Ok I'll start by saying im incredibly biased because I cant stand franz ferdinand. They sound like a cheesy cabaret act that decided to turn out a band. In fact this is worse- the lead singer is pompous and arrogant- the rest of the band throw little or nothing to the band with tired old guitar riffs, the choruses are incredibly generic, boring and repetitive, the lyrics are stupid- its as if they tried been all cryptic and clever and then thought sod it lets just throw random words in instead so we can complete the rest of our radiohead clich.  <br /> <br />It gets worse- the way the lead singer hangs onto the end of each word is incredibly irritating and the lyrics are so bad even the other band members don't understand them. Sometimes I wonder if they even know they're in a band or weather the lead singer has just brainwashed them all.  <br /> <br />I just had to write this review cos im so annoyed with people  laying praise on this vastly overrated band just because the Uk hasn't turned anything decent out in the last 10 years the media has to leap on the bandwagon praising bands with little talent like this. I wish they'd realise that indie died years ago. None of these imitation bands can do it justice. Just go away and let us move on!!!
B00005JO1Y|5.0|For every fifty or one hundred bad remakes one or two surpass the original. Especially if the film being remade is a cultural icon. If it ain't broke don't fix it many a critic of remakes would say. But like theatre that is imagined by different people all the time sometimes a fresh visionary can breath new life into an old story.<br /><br />Peter Jackson's KING KONG is a gutsy movie. When Jackson first announced his intention to take on the 1933 classic I like many thought back to the tragic and laughable 1976 remake that had a guy running around in a monkey suit and Jessica Lange hamming it up on the top of the Twin Towers. Let's face it in our modern times a movie about an ape running around New York City is so far fetched and silly there is absolutely no way to take it seriously. Jackson understood that and puts the action of KING KONG back in the 30's where the material and the world around the characters can be built by scratch. This works so well I could go on for pages about how good it is.<br /><br />But I digress....<br /><br />KING KONG follows the exploits of Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) a young actress whose just lost her last job. With no money in her pockets and the prospect of stripping for burlesque show, she agrees to star in struggling director Carl Denham (Jack Black) new film. Along with a dreamy leading man (Kyle Chandler), a writer (Adrian Brody), and motley crew of sailors and film people. Our hero's set sail to find a mysterious island in which will make the film a hit. To bad a certain Giant Ape, some Dinosaurs, a group of creepy natives, and various other wild animals will make that a little difficult for our intrepid band of misfits.<br /><br />KING KONG is three movies crammed into three hours and ten minutes. Movie 1 is a silly 30's romantic comedy, movie 2 is an intense horror film and movie 3 is a monster run amok in New York City. Apart they wouldn't work, but together Jackson has weaved a narrative that is better than the one conceived 70 years ago. That was merely the cliff notes. KING KONG is the richest popcorn movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />It's brimming with excitement. You cringe, you jump and most importantly you have a great time. This is the reason I go to the movies. From the first moment to the last KING KONG captures your attention and doesn't let go. One moment you laugh, the next you jump out of your seat, and then the next moment you laugh. Only a film with heart can do that.<br /><br />Instead of the subtext that has been heaped on the original by 70 years of critical praise. Jackson ups the ante by crafting a Kong that is almost human. He honestly loves Ann, and Ann is not just a screaming damsel. She truly cares for KONG. Although the giant ape is completely computer generated it's Andy Serkis's who provided the artists with Kong's movements and that really makes this Kong stick out. Like his work on LOTR as Gollum there is a lifelike quality to Kong that is so flawlessly beautiful.<br /><br />The other key factor to the film success is that Ann Darrow is not merely a damsel in distress. She has a heart and a soul. Watts fills Darrow with with such nuance and humanity. I'm not even sure the screenplay calls for the amount of passion she brings to it. A lesser actress could have done an adequate job. But Watts is just phenomenal and takes this b-movie premise into blockbuster territory.<br /><br />Kudos also go to Jack Black, Adrain Brody, and the rest of the cast who embody these characters with so much life. KONG would fail if it was just another special effects blockbuster. But because the actors and Jackson placed character above action, when these characters are in peril you actually feel for them. Thus their peril is kicked up a notch, and the audience has a lot of fun.<br /><br />Not since Indiana Jones has an adventure movie been so much fun to watch. A film that is so vibrant, so full of pure unadulterated joy and so much real imagination. KING KONG is easily the bestfilm I've seen in the last five or six years. It's awesome.<br /><br />I think I figured out Jackson secret to making such successful films. His production team is a well oiled machine. Unlike most films that require a director to pick all new people on every project. Jackson, his wife Fran Walsh, and Phillipa Boyens have been working together since the mid 90's with editor Jamie Selkirk who has been with Jackson since the beginning. They know how to read each other and together they have crafted great film after great film.<br /><br />KING KONG is a marvellous screen outing. See on the big screen because it will lose something on even the biggest TV Screen. Run, swing on a vine, or order your tickets online. Just go see this movie.G is easily the best film I've seen in the last five or six years. It's awesome.  <br /> <br />I think I figured out Jackson secret to making such successful films.

B000002I4S|5.0|John Coltrane's genius is laid bare before the listener of Giant Steps.  At the time of its release, jazz was in a stage of upheaval with the onset of the free movement, but Coltrane found his own space where music reigned supreme.  The entire album is beautiful, melodic, exciting and cohesive.  There's no need to name off any standout tracks because it's solid front to back.
B000002UAO|5.0|Hard to say what the best beatles album is but i love this one.  White Album, Abbey Road and Let it Be are right up there too.  Revolver is sort of tedious. But all in all this is a great album so grab it, and grab the others too.  Unless you've listened to beatles properly you have very little claim to jumping on board new bands and bagging them as some reviewers have. Not what someone wants for a history defining album maybe, but thats what makes them defining, they aren't what you expect.
B000000WCA|5.0|1996 was the year in music mostly remembered for the Spice Girls, they assaulted the charts quicker than any other artist before them. In one year the had sold millions of singles, countless #1 chart appearances and had taken the world by storm. Spice still remains their biggest album to date and to many their best, but they were more than just a debut album, they were real people. They basically crusaded for femininity, you could call them to some extreme extent 90's sufferagettes.<br /><br />While the weren't political, women flourished under them with that saying 'girl-power!'. The Spice Girls were magical and mesmerising. This album clearly shows why.<br /><br />Wannabe burst onto the top of the charts in over 20 countries worldwide and cemented their over-night success. Wannabe is an amazing song, the hook is so memorable and just plain silly but it works and obviously sold the song well. While not their best song it is a classic 90's dance anthem.<br /><br />Say You'll Be There is another of their bigest hits and best songs. It has a little country flair with a superb harmonica in the background. The video is also memorable. The girls really unite on this track. It is great.<br /><br />It isn't all fun and games on Spice however, it does have some superb adult-contemporary ballads thrown in there for good measure. 2 Become 1 is one of the most notable and successfull. This ballad is so beautiful, the strings are just so lush and serene. The chorus is the best on the album.<br /><br />Love Thing is a groovy little number. It actually rivals the singles off this album!! The chorus is so catchy, I like the bass line also. I also like the pre-chorus with Mel.B & Geri (I think!!).<br /><br />Last Time Lover starts off with a hip-hop(ish) drum beat, it is really quite classy and sexy. Mel.B's voice sounds really erotic, the chorus sounds a little ho-ish but is really good. Sounds like a club hit. It could have been another potential singer.<br /><br />Mama is a beautiful pop-ballad that just strikes my heart everytime I listen to it. I love every aspect of this song. It really is quite empowering. It sounds as if it is recorded live.<br /><br />The guitars really drive the song and I enjoy the synths in the background.<br /><br />Disco driven hit Who Do You Think You Are? sounds like it is taken straight from an 80's dancefloor. I used to love this song, back in the day!! Another single and hit.<br /><br />Lean back and listen to the sophistication of Something Kinda Funny wash over you. It sounds really intimate and sensual. Their voices are so creamy and velvety in this song.<br /><br />Naked demands attention! I like the programming and the nearly spoken-word vocals. The Spice Girls are really mature on this album. This is the most sexually extrovertal song on the album. Ironic??!!. I remember the chorus so well.<br /><br />If You Can't Dance is a great last track. It is a ragga/reggae track that works really well. It shows off Mel.B as the centrepiece of the group. I enjoy the beats and the noises in the background and the harmony in the chorus.<br /><br />Overall, Spice is an icon of the 90's. This isn't an album to me, this is an object of history. It is so marvellous. All the tracks never drop below heavenly ecstasy. Buy this album it really is worth the money, whatever the price.a beautiful pop-ballad that just strikes my heart everytime I listen to it. I love every aspect of this song.

B00005JO1Y|4.0|King Kong proves to be a highly entertaining movie that should make almost anyone who loves movies to sit down and watch it. The movie however, isn't as perfect as one could wish for and there are strengths and weaknesses here. Naomi Watts carried this movie like no other actress. I am not sure if Jack Black and Adrian Brody really fit the types, I thought they were miscast in their roles. I also didn't think it was a good idea to make Carl Denham character so self-centered and without honor as well.<br /><br />On the whole, Peter Jackson's movie is divided into three parts, before Skull Island, Skull Island and New York City.<br /><br />Before Skull Island part consisted mostly of background story, character development and overall, bit too long and dry for a movie of this kind. The main attention should be given to the main four characters of the movie, Carl Denhem, Ann Darrow, Jack Driscoll and the ship's captain but somehow, other minor \\"redshirt\\" characters were allowed in which dragged out the process bit too long. (\\"Redshirt\\" - ol'Star Trek term for dead men walking and talking.) If any part of the movie should be edited, it should be this part.<br /><br />Skull Island part is the heart and soul of the film. We should praised Peter Jackson highly here since he actually created a real romance story between the blonde and her big ape. The special effects were wonderful and the entire part was highly exciting but what made it work was Naomi Watts' skills as an actress and how well she interacted with what basically was, a computer generated creature play acted by Andy Serkis who once more did a superb job. In some funny way, this entire Skull Island part proves to be one giant romance sequence with other humans and prehistoric monsters getting in the way. You got Naomi Watts playing hard to get and King Kong doing his alpha male bit. I think the key point which was skillfully done was when Naomi Watts confronted by a hungry T-Rex, retreated into the shadow and protection of her ape kidnapper/protector who risked all to fight for her. As a director, Jackson did a superb job getting to that part to make Naomi Watts' conversion very realistic. (Some cynics might call this a bad case of the Stockholm syndrome.)<br /><br />The New York City part basically followed the original 1933 version almost to the letter. King Kong was chained, he escaped, he find Ann Darrow, he escaped to the Empire State Building and there he dies from bullets shot by those pesky biplanes. But the major difference lies in the fact that unlike Fay Wray's character in 1933, Naomi Watts' Ann Darrow actually care for King Kong and understood him as no human could. This sense of empathy and compassion that she had for her one time captor seem to be the core of the movie and what make this movie work so well as not only as action adventure movie but in real sense, a love story between the beauty and the beast.<br /><br />The fact that Peter Jackson was able to create this creditable emotional appeal from a computer generated creature remains a testament to his skill as a storyteller. The move come highly recommended. Its over three hours long but once you get into the second part, its all a very fast roller coaster ride!!w and protection of her ape kidnapper/protector who risked all to fight for her.

0553801503|1.0|I absolutely loved the first three books.  They were well-written, and the stories were facinating and intriguing.  I couldn''t put the books down.  This book, however, was basically a waste of time.  Reading it was an absolute chore - -something I did because I already has so much emotional capital invested in the story.  This book moved the story not an inch.  I don't know who to blame, the author or the editors; but I believe the editors at fault.  The book is still well written, but Mr. Martin has gone down the path of Robert Jordan, a series I gave up on a long time ago.  I hope the next book restores the luster to a series that is now tainted.
B000002540|3.0|A thoroughly enjoyable if not somewhat incomplete live album that provides a snapshot into BOC circa 1974-1975. Some of the recordings are slightly muddy and distorted, for example, \\"The Red and the Black\\" and \\"Hot Rails to Hell\\", but all in all, this is a classic. Later live albums would have better production, but would lack the loose jam  style of this gem. For example, listen to the jamming on the first cut, \\"Subhuman\\"; this is BOC at their finest moment...1974-1975, young hungry musicians at the peak of creativity.   Some of the classics are strangely missing.....try to get BOC Live in the West bootleg for more from this time period.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|OH! so beautiful and full of imaginations. <br />This is what I ever dream of on Christmas Eve, travel to the land of Santas, gift and candies ...... <br />Hope you enjoy it and brings back your childhood's dream.
B00003CXMG|5.0|This movie just rocks... and in this case that isn't just an expression.  Almost Famous would be a good movie under any circumstances.  The story is well-written, the acting is almost uniformly excellent, the cinematography is really sharp, etc.  But let's face it, what really makes this movie is the music.  Best.  Soundtrack.  Ever.  If you grew up during the 60's, 70's, and even the early 80's the music in this movie was the soundtrack of your life.  Watching this movie is almost like being back there again.  I can't believe it's selling for under eight bucks.  What a bargain.  Don't pass it by.
B0000640VN|5.0|\\"Moonriver\\" is always my heart breaking music melody. <br />It's a beautiful, impossible love story about this busy working woman, Kate and a DUKE, what a strange set up ....  <br />The idea of time \\"crack\\" is stupid, anyway it does not affect the whole story. <br />Hugh is a good actor.  <br />
B0009I7NNA|2.0|This CD is completely horrible. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the actual music part of the album is strong. The vocals are weak, and the band is only a shadow of their former selves. This is a terrible follow up to Waking the Fallen, which was an extremely well written album. So if you like A7X's previous albums, this will be a total waste. They're now just a hardcore band turned mainstream. (No screaming on the whole album, how is that hardcore?)
B000067J1I|5.0|I watched it when I was teenage, I like he acts very much at that time, long before he win the Oscar. <br />I watch almost every film he did if I got a chance, such as \\"Splash\\" ... etc. <br />However, BIG is my all time favorite.
B000002MTR|5.0|It's totally crazy that there are so many bad reviews from this album. It's the first RHCP album that I actually have purchased(always been a fan of their hits, Aeroplane being my favorite so I bought this first) and it's just an amazing FUN album. <br /> <br />Sure J.Fruciante was gone but no one can deny how great of a guitarist Dave Navarro was, Jane's Addiction was an amazing band and he was an essential part of that. Also HOW CAN PEOPLE KNOCK ON COFFEE SHOP?! Such a fun song, loud, crazy, fast and eclectic makes me want to jump up and down whenever I hear it. Same with Shallow Be Thy Game, they had a lot of pent up energy released in these louder songs of One Hot Minute. <br /> <br />In short, don't compare this to the likes of BSSM or Californication because it's a very different band with Navarro in here, but it's still great and i'm willing to be you'll enjoy it.
B00015YVD6|4.0|How can people imagine a man change to mermaid ?! ha ha ha <br />Tom Hanks did it.
B000AYQLX6|5.0|Sometimes I've got to wonder if people are listening to the same album as I am. Walls and Bridges is a great album. It's consistantly listanable, creative and surprising from start to finish. That's more than I can say for Some Time in New York City, his weakest solo album, and for Mind Games, which, while it has several excellent songs, it's also full of weak and forgettable songs. (One day at a Tim, Meat City, The Nutopian Anthem; none of these are very good) Walls and Bridges has some of John's best performances, both as a writter and as a singer. You Don't Know What You Got is about the toughest vocal performance since The White Album. Another interesting point: Lost weekend or not, it's funny that most of the photos taken during this period show John Smiling and having fun, much like he usually appeared in the years before meeting Yoko. Watch the Anthology: pre Yoko, John is usually smiling and joking; from Yoko onward, he's almost always bitter and angry looking; Lost weekend, smiling and joking again; back with Yoko, the smiles gone. Interesting, no?

B00006L83N|5.0|I just cry of pleasure while listening to the Accolade II... i can't think of anything else than a warrior returning to his lands, just to find that a bastard has destroyed everything, and what does he says?? \\"I will stand, will you??\\" <br /> <br />This guys are one of the most powerful bands i've ever heard, i saw them a couple of times in concert and it's incredible. it would be nice to have more people interested in this kind of music. <br /> <br />Cheers!
0062502182|1.0|I can tell you by reading some of their \\"books\\" in the original version (in portuguese) that they are even worst that in English. SURPRISE ME that we have great writers in Brazil nowadays and only this self called \\"Magician\\" is recognized. <br />He only uses \\"clichs\\" that all good authors have already written about, but unfortunately he does not have any talent to plagiarize. <br />Don't waste your time and money on his books...he does not have any talent, he does not know how to write a good portuguese and his ideas are so clichs ... If you are really looking for something new and really good, try some of the Jose Saramago's books. He's portuguese, a Nobel Prize winner and a gifted writer...  <br />Paulo Coelho is just an oportunist....
B000099T2L|3.0|Can Beyonce sing? Does she have star quality? Is she beautiful? The answer is YES!!! Is this CD amazing? No. <br /> <br />Beyonce can belt out songs better than most. She puts her all into every performance she does, but the music on this album ranges from boring to excellent. The good songs are the singles, generally. Then it begins to fall apart. There are way too many below average ballads. The closer I get to you brings a bit of class to the album as well as Beyonce with Luther Vandross. The seductive Be With You is also well done. These songs are not unique but bring out Beyonce's voice and works well for her. The lyrical arraingement of the song Dangerously in Love is a mess. I could have been great. <br /> <br />Though the radio singles featuring other \\"artist\\" generally work, the danger lies that she may become dependant on them and so the term \\"solo\\" artist may not apply completely to her until her next <br />album if she drops the \\"featuring.\\" <br /> <br />It's a much better \\"solo\\" release than Gwen Stefani's Love Angle Music Baby (which I expected better from her). If you like the singles then get this album plus a couple of other good not great songs. If you want a masterpiece or and excellent album look elsewhere..
B0001LJC2K|5.0|okay they might sound a little like Radiohead, but not that much for goodness sake. I feel the lead singer in Muse has a better voice then Thom's. But that isnt the point. This is a beautiful album. Every song is well produced and it comes together very well. Great album, you will NOT regret your purchase. yeahhh a yeahhh yeahhh o oooo ooo ooo - Thoughts of a Dying Atheist

B000059GEI|5.0|Why did Marilyn accept such a limited role as Vicky after she was a full star in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953) is hard to  explain.  Yet there are things in this movie that has caught my attention.  As soon as Marilyn appears as the Hat check girl named Vicky, she mentiones that she has just finished acting in the CHERRY  ORCHARD, a Chekov play. This movie was filmed 2 years before she  joined the Actor Studio. But at this time, she was receiving  acting lessons from Michael Chekhov, nephew of Anton Chekov the  Russian playwright who wrote the Cherry Orchard. One gets the  feeling that this dialogue in the film was suggestedby Marilyn  herself. It shows the intellectual side of Marilyn.  Her comic ability does not get many scenes. There's is a comic  scene in which she plays with the pronunciation of the word  AFTER, right before she sings her sing AFTER YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT YOU DON'T WANT IT.  Her best number is HEAT WAVE. Even today it does not look dated.  Her other number LAZY is ok, where she shares the number with  Mitzy Gaynor and Dan Dailey. I felt a more glamorous number  could have been selected here.  You'd be surprised was a number deleted from the film, but it is found in many Marilyn Monroe CDs .In Donald OConnors song  A MAN CHASES A GIRL Marilyn provides a background voice. This  song was later recorded by Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds and  it became a hit.   Marilyn deserved a more comic role in this film. Walter Lang did  not know how to make good use of Marilyn's humorous ability. In  her next film, the SEVEN YEAR ITCH, Billy Wilder got a tremendous performance out of Marilyn.
B000AARKOO|5.0|Anybody writing a bad review about this movie is simply an air head.<br />If you liked Joan of Arc, Troy or Alexander, this one is for you.<br />If you know the history of jerusalem and the Crusaders you will fall in love with this movie. If you don't, it would be a great history lesson full of feelings and action. There is no better way in describing the time of Jerusalem and the Crusaders in any better way; a love story as well. Costumes, music and Photography are simply great, quality of the dvd and sound is also perfect. Highly recommended.<br />Make sure to get Kingdom of Heaven (the Director's Cut). This is a longer version DVD packed with extra features.
B0006GAOBI|2.0|When talk of a director's cut for one of my favorite movies in recent history was buzzing around, I admit that I was quite excited.  Especially by the prospect of seeing Donnie Darko in a theater.  However, the theatrical release of the director's cut was short lived and only found its way into certain (two, maybe?) cities.  So like most everyone else, I had to rent this version.   <br /> <br />Be warned that this version is inferior to the original theatrical realease of Donnie Darko.  All of the fun of piecing the movie together thru repeated viewings and trips to donniedarko.com was sucked out of this release.  Some of the music was changed (some new pieces added, some old ones taken away), some pages from the Philosophy of Time Travel were added in at differnt points of the film (here is where the fun sucking started) and something happened to the sound mix.  The original version had an aura of mystique around it; hard to explain, but as you watched you found yourself entirely focused on the dialogue.  This is not the case anymore with the director's cut.  It sounds as if there is too much noise going on.   <br /> <br />In any case, don't spend your money on this product.  I'd recommend picking up the original version, which is a five star film.  After a few viewings, head on over to the website and see what you can see.
B00062RCBW|4.0|If you are a Star Trek person, this serie is a great one to own.<br />Great episodes, great actors with amazing characters.<br />The reason it gets 4 stars only, is because of the low quality picture due to the old TV recording technology. Watching this serie on a big screen TV is less than satisfactory, however you get use to the lower resolution after watching few good episodes. And now with the low price that Amazon is offering this complete 7 seasons, I say it is really worth it. Enjoy
0451528298|5.0|\\"The Moonstone\\" is a masterpiece.  Originally published serially in Charles Dickens' monthly journal \\"All the Year Round,\\" it is widely regarded as the first of its genre: the detective story.  While a contemporary of Dickens, Collins' writing style is more accessible, in my opinion, to the general reader.  In fact, its initial publication in \\"All the Year Round\\" outsold Dickens' own \\"Tale of Two Cities\\" and \\"Great Expectations.\\"<br /><br />Collins' characters are unforgettable, especially the tragic Ezra Jennings, the silly, hypocritical Miss Clack, and the sad Rosanna Spearman.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the hint of things occultish makes this very unlike most other novels of the period and hightens the feeling of danger and mystery.<br /><br />This book is entirely delightful.  Don't miss an oppotunity to discover \\"The Moonstone.\\"
0553801503|5.0|Wow, a five year wait and still half the people that read this book are unsatisfied. <br /> <br />Of course, everyone's a critic. I would have written the book like this, I would have done that and blah, blah, blah. Fact is, we get much needed details on what is happening in the other parts of Westeros. Lavish details, vividly describing and creating a picture in the mind's eye of the realms. Unlike so many other novels, I love this book. Nobody can create a scene like Martin. <br /> <br />I sorely miss The Onion Knight, but the war between Robb and the Lannisters is over. Personally, I can't see how anyone who has been engrossed in Westeros can't like what's happening. Then again, people have preconceived notions. You have to love it when the fans know what's better than the actual creator. <br /> <br />Martin writes for READERS, not skimmers. <br /> <br />Give me a break, posers.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I only saw the movie Serenity a couple of months ago when it first came to Australia, I had no idea what it was about and when we sat down in the cinema my friend lent over and asked if I had seen the series 'Firefly', not wanting to disapoint I nodded mutely. Afterwards I had fallen in love with 'Serenity' and it's crew especialy the doctor. Then a few months later my dad comes home with a surprise, it's the box set of the complete series, although I'm disapointed to find it wasn't as 'complete' as I thought. I found out that the series was cancelled by Fox, which I think was a seriously wrong thing to do. I love the show and watching an episode or two after school is like waking up at christmas and finding a heap of presents, I enjoy the episodes that much!!!
B00025ETIW|5.0|There are no words to describe the lyrical mastery that mcr has accomplished through this album, i'm still trying piece every lyric together in every song to put together the story, because this album is a story, rather than just segmented songs. I mainly listen to rap and hip hop (the REAL stuff) and MCR is the only band that I have come close to listening to as much as I listen to linkin park. MCR's lyrics are almost the rock equivalent to Tupac Shakur's lyrics, considered by many as the best of all time because of their depth and underlying message. It is understandable that many would let this fly under the radar as what you guys call \\"emo\\" because that's initially how i perceived it, but this album is the closest thing ever to a rock romeo and juliet. And no, i don't feel sorry for myself when I listen to it, lmao.

WHEN I HEARD A THIRD TELLING OF THIS OPUS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, I SAID, WHY, WHY, OH DEAR LORD WHY!!! <br />WELL THIS IS WHAT THE 1976 VERSION WAS LACKING, AND WHAT JURASSIC PARK III WAS LACKING---FRESHNESS, NON-STOP ACTION SEQUENCES, SOME BREATHTAKING, HUMOR AND MOST OF ALL THE HUMAN ELEMENT.  THIS IS A TOUCHING FILM OF LOVE, TRUST, AND CROSSING BOUNDRIES.  THIS FILM WILL STAND ALONE AS ONE OF HE GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE.  IT BLEW ME AWAY.  PETER JACKSON IS TRULY AN ARTIST AND WAS A LOVER OF THE ORIGINAL AND IT SHINES HERE.  THE CAST IS BRILLIANT, THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE AWESOME, AND THE ACTION IS NONSTOP.

0743265289|1.0|Although I thought this book would be very helpful in my quest to score well on the GMAT, I found that all of the questions in the book can also be found in the Kaplan study guides. That's right, if you take the Kaplan course, you will get the same questions in your CD-Rom and online resources as those offerred in the book. So if you're not in the Kaplan course, this book will probably serve its purpose. However, if you ponied up the money for the Kaplan course, buy a different book.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|To Sam Rubin, Entertainment Reporter.  First of all, I'm sure you're a nice person and good person.   I again am emailing you again to express my view concerning the 2003 movie, \\"The Last Samurai.\\"   I'm not saying you''re culturally biased or negative, but I hope you give a movie a chance that may concern Japanese history or culture.   Again, I'm going to be honest that I didn't hear your review of this movie, but I did hear you in a sarcastic comment you had on your morning news with Mark Kriski putting down this movie.  Again, this movie was based on an actual event in Japanese history in the 1800's, and the fact that this movie was terribly critiqued by some critics (although there were those who liked this movie), I am still diappointed.   One possible reason for this was that maybe there as a cultural bias against this movie that glorified Japanese culture and history.  After seeing this movie, again I was very moved and thought this was an incredible movie.  Although this is going back 2 years, I thought I would voice my disgust if you were very negative in your review of \\"The Last Samurai.\\"  I've written to you but I just wanted to express that I'm not saying your were being culturally biased against this movie that Roeper and Ebert liked, but if you were biased against this movie, I hope you can be open to other Japanese based cultural movies in the future.  I know you have been on The Howard Stern show and I have listened to him too.  But if you were leaning towards a negative viewpoint  or critique of this movie and being overly aggressive against such a cultural based movie, I'm very disappointed.    Again, I've seen this movie and so did others I know and we enjoyed this movie.  I know there are no right or wrong reviews in that the review is based on a person's opinions, but I still hope you or other critics can be open and understanding of Japanese or other cultural movies in the future.   <br />     I know some have a culturally biased views againstJapanese cultural or people or  movies going back since World War 2, but I just hope you can be open and accepting and not be close minded to movies that might talk about Japanese culture or such subjects. <br /> <br />Thanks.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I am a little suspicious of short stories that are turned into movies.  I always wonder: How are they going to fill the other hour-and-a-half?  Strangely, this problem does not occur in Brokeback Mountain.  I'd read the short story first and - watching the movie - I did not feel that they were padding for time.  In fact, it seems like the story can barely be contained to the time restrictions of the movie. <br /> <br />Perhaps this is because this movie is about emotions and images - not words.  Its characters are not from a very verbal society.  In fact, it is a running joke in the film how little Ennis (Heath Ledger) speaks.  The little dialogue from the short story lasts the whole movie. <br /> <br />This is a Western - Ang Lee beautifully captures the Wyoming countryside.  When the action moves into town, the sight of man's raunchy trailers and houses set against the backdrop of the majestic mountains makes a convincing argument for nature over civilization.   <br /> <br />It is civilization that is ultimately the downfall of these two characters.  They meet and fall in love - all the while convinced that they are not homosexuals.  The story begins in 1963 and - if it had occurred a little later - tragedy may have been averted.  Yet, despite the tragic overtones of the story, there is still something joyful about it.  Despite all odds, these two men find each other and - a few times a year at least - find true happiness.  Perhaps that makes everything else worth while. <br />
B00007EDY5|4.0|It adds a PC sync socket to cameras that only have a hot shoe and makes it possible to use a much larger selection of flash units with a variety of cameras, not just Nikon.  <br /> <br />While it does not do TTL, most flash units can use their automatic sensors to meter output. <br /> <br />Used it extensively with a Nikon Coolpix 5000 and newer Vivitar 285 and 283 flash units.  Also tested it with a Canon Rebel. <br /> <br />Please note: <br />Make sure you test your flash's trigger voltage if using something not recommended for your camera, digital or not. <br /> <br />If you have a camera that uses iTTL, like the Nikon D70s, you pretty much have to get one of the iTTL flash units.
B000001F7E|5.0|Many people think Rod Stewart sucks, and frankly, based on much of his work, I cannot fault them for thinking so.  If you like rock and roll and can spare 15 bucks, buy this CD and you'll learn that Rod had at least one shining moment.  Along with Exile On Main Street by the Stones, this is the best rock album of the 1970's.
0553382179|3.0|I bought this book because I'm a 24 year-old newlywed, part time substitute teacher, full time telecommuter with my online business, who's sensitive about the fact that I live in CHAOS, or \\"Can't have anybody over syndrome.\\"  I felt disappointed in myself for not keeping a clean house and felt that, even though he never said anything, that it was something that bothered him about me.  I've long thought that if I could change one thing, it'd be the way I keep house.  Enter this book.  This book comes highly recommended, so I figured it'd be the motivation that I need to find myself and restore my house to a livable condition again.<br /><br />Overall, I'm on the fence about the book.  For every one thing I can find to recommend it, I find one thing that I disliked.  The suggestions for house cleaning, the putting out your \\"hot spots,\\" the \\"27 fling boogie,\\" the 5 minute room rescue, and the marathon cleaning techniques were all extremely helpful.  I found that doing these small things kept me from being not only overwhelmed with cleaning, but made an impact in the overall cleanliness of my home.  The control journal is a lifesaver, the perfect way for tracking what needs to be done and when.  It's nice to have a record of the last time you cleaned those \\"rarely cleaned\\" items, because I often found myself saying \\"well, I just cleaned ______\\" for about 6 months, past the point where it obviously needs to be cleaned again.  The room zones were just brilliant.  Breaking down the house into zones was an immense help and it really helped to make sure that along with your routines you spent time majorly cleaning or picking up a room.  It is the perfect compliment to the smaller routines she suggested (hot spot cleaning, 27 fling boogie, etc).  I even found the suggestions for the order of cleaning to be immensely helpful because I allow my rooms to get to a point of such disaster that I don't know where to start, so looking at a check list that lays out a plan of attack keeps me from being overwhelmed.  This book is good for those of us who've lived in constant disaster for longer than can be imagined, who are just desperately seeking a place to start, some foothold to gain so that we can regain our lives.  This book gave me a framework which I adapted to my own routine and cleaning ability, so even though I didn't follow it exactly, it gave me that idea I desperately needed.<br /><br />My problems with this book...  The author starts right off by saying she's writing the book because she was so deeply touched by ANOTHER book (Sidetracked Home Executives by Pam Young and Peggy Jones), which she adapted to form her routine, which she writes about in this book.  My first thought was \\"well if that book worked so well for her, why did I buy this book?\\"  I wondered if I might be better off getting the information from the source, instead of the reinterpreted information from the FlyLady.  The other problem I had was that there was a lot of wasted information and space in this book...  To get to the nuggets about cleaning and reclaiming your home from clutter, you read through countless pages by the author about how her method will rock your world and change your life.  Even through chapter 6 she was still talking about how her methods will save you from disaster.  And the entire book was packed with testimonials of FlyBabies who were thanking the FlyLady for chaning their lives.  I got frustrated because if I didn't believe that, I wouldn't have bought the book, and so the constant readvertising of this instead of addressing techniques or ideas was frustrating to me.  I kind of got the impression that this book was a warm-up act for the website.<br /><br />The thing that, I think, bothered me the most was the constant reminder of your own accountability in keeping your house clean, the reminder that what you're doing is a \\"blessing\\" to the family, and that you should trudge along to reclaim your house because \\"it didn't happen overnight.\\"But then she almost absolves the rest of the family from any sort of culpability in the house becoming the way it does, and in turn, for being any part of the solution.  She says that because you don't set the example of cleanliness, they don't clean in response to you.  She chapter 5 she even states:  \\"Have a family meeting tonight.  I would like you to sit down with your family and apologize for not setting the proper example in the past for them.  Tell them about your new routines and FlyLady.  Ask for help in establishing routines.  Be honest!  Kids love it when you are honest and apologize.\\"  I read that and I couldn't help but think that for those of us who feel sore about our lack of housecleaning, making an admission of full guilt in that doesn't help the situation.  The insult that adds to injury is that just after this announcement that you make to your family, that you're doing a new routine and need help, she writes the following:  \\"Quit being a martyr!  Do the things that need to be done to get your home in order.  If your children or husband are not doing their jobs around the house, then take the jobs back and do them yourself.\\"  I guess I just found it insulting to imply in one statement that you need to get help, then imply in the next that your family may be incapable of helping you so you should just simply take on their duties yourself.  This makes cleaning more daunting because if you're in a family like mine where you're 50% of the mess, doing your part to make the house presentable without asking the same sort of thing from the people who live with you, you spend an inordinate amount of time cleaning up after people instead of maintaining cleanliness.  When she said that you could reclaim rooms in your house or your cleanliness in \\"a few short months\\", I just wanted to shout, \\"If you get your family to help, it can be shorter than that!\\"  I guess this was just frustrating to me.  As was her constant speaking of how her house is in fantastic working order and she is happy and successful in her life in home.  It was not motivational to me to hear her talk about her practical perfection, and it came off as sort of rubbing my nose in it, almost in hopes of shaming me to do the same.<br /><br />I know that people in reviews also thought the idea of dressing up and putting on make-up and your good jewelry and pearls to clean (yes, she did suggest that) was a little too June Cleaver, and I have to admit that I myself have problems feeling productive cleaning when I'm wearing nice clothes with my good jewelry (bleaching things wearing a $4,000 wedding ring just doesn't seem like a good idea to me), but I understand the methodology and I imagine it works for some (though it worked better for me to have a \\"clean house wardrobe\\", something that was nice but that if it got ruined I wouldn't lose sleep over it).  The chapter about how house cleaning is your testimonial to God and a way to worship him would be off-putting to some too, I imagine.  I know being Wiccan, I found little relevance in this chapter to my life, but I applaud people who can.  I was also hoping for a little more in the way of organization tips, ways to utilize space or have things laid out so that cleaning was easier and easier to maintain, but I got a book on organization to fill that gap.<br /><br />I don't know.  There is a lot to recommend this book, but there is a lot that was hard to palate for me personally.  Nobody said it was easy to clean house, but I guess I'm still looking for that book that is the happy medium between June Cleaver and her guide to being a good wife and the disarray I'm living in now.  I need help cleaning, I do not need 72 pages of member testimonial telling me why the FlyLady is so great...  Especially when these testimonails are based off of information that was gotten off her website.  I think that if she had weeded out the testimonals, cut back on the self endorsement a bit, and paired her information on cleaning with organizational tips and ideas so that when you did your hot spot cleaning there was a plan for what to do with the stuff, this book would have been an unbeatable tool for house cleaning.  Instead I can't help but feel as if I've been given half the tools I need to regain my life and house.<br /><br />I mean, it's all well and good to clean your sink to see your reflection, but is it really practical to clean the sink and then follow behind your family to dry the sink after every use of the water to keep water spots from forming (as she suggests), especially when you come from a point of complete organization disaster and CHAOS?<br /><br />I can't say I wouldn't suggest this book to other people in my position, but I can't suggest it with the zeal that some others here have.  It did help me develop a routine and a way to regain control of my house and clutter, and it did help me set up routines to change my life and house, so it did accomplish that goal.  But I had to do a lot of fishing, sorting, skimming, rewritting, reforming, to get it.  I guess that means I should write my own book...  ;) I would say a book on organization is needed to get the full FlyLady effect though.<br /><br />Just my $.02, it certainly isn't a popular $.02 considering her legions of devoted fans who find her to be an inspiration, but it's my honest review.e is happy and successful in her life in home.

B00004SVID|5.0|This HAS to be one of the _greatest_ live albums of all time. I love it more than P.U.L.S.E. (which is a masterpiece in it's own right, mind you) AND Delicate Sound of Thunder (very underrated).<br /><br />This album features different songs recorded from various performances from the years 1980 and 1981. Many of the performances were performed in Earl's Court in London.  This album gives us amazing extended solos by David Gilmour (one of the greatest guitarists of all time) and Rick Wright (PF's keyboardist), excellent drumming by Nick Mason, while the songs are emotionally sung by Roger Waters, live versions of album outtakes (What Shall We Do Now, The Last Few Bricks), and the remastered-in-2005 sound quality is so amazing, you'll feel as if you're there when you listen to it.<br /><br />The crowd noise doesn't interfere in or between the songs, because it has been \\"muted\\" (in other words: you only hear the crowd at the beginning or ending of each song). I do believe this album is superior to it's studio counterpart, but I love both versions.<br /><br />Recommended to casual OR die-hard Floyd fans. Phenomenal, to say the least.
B000BNI90O|5.0|In tackling Tolkiens daunting world, Shore and all who were involved surprised and awed us all with how completely he has dipped us into the world of Middle Earth. He has succeeded in doing this as masterfully as Tolkien has with his storytelling and research. I have yet to see as comprehensive a soundtrack as this anywhere, at any time. Where we are used to getting entire operas on cd, now we get Shores visually operatic score. I wish we could get this kind of treatment with other scores as well. I can only hope this sets a precedent. <br /> <br />Namarie!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Filmed on October 20th, 1994 at Earls Court in London, the film version of P.U.L.S.E. is a recording of a single performance at Earl's Court in London, while the accompanying live double-CD album was recorded from this as well as several additional performances. There was an official DVD release of P.U.L.S.E. in 2000 by EMI, but due to licensing reasons, only a few were sold. These few are rare collector's items.<br /><br />The long awaited Pink Floyd P.U.L.S.E. DVD is offically being released on June 6th 2006.
B000BJS4BM|2.0|As I have already reviewed this album, there no need to do it again, although it's worth mentioning again that it is a spectacular collection of songs and my favourite album released in 2005 by a long shot. <br /> <br />The point of this review is the limited edition packaging.  I have always bought both the regular and limited packaging of Madonna's albums for years now as I am a die-hard fan...and there is no doubt, she is just not all that great at putting these together.  Although the limited edition of Ray of Light was beautiful to look at, there was not one added feature.  The LE of American Life was a cute little box with silly stamps and a semi-quality poster inside, but not much else!  Even the weblinks were the same as those on the regular album.  So I had the highest hopes that she'd finally get it right and Confessions on a Dance Floor's Special Limited Edition would be truly be worthwhile.  <br />The DVD-like size of the box is wonderful, and gave an impression of greatness, but once again, it only has one real redeeming feature: at least it has one new song. <br /> <br />\\"Fighting Spirit,\\" although not as good as the iTunes bonus track \\"Super Pop,\\" is a sufficiently good extra song that has been tagged on to the end of this incredible album, but certainly nothing to rave about.  Don't get me wrong, produced by Mirwais, the bonus track is, just like \\"Let it Will be\\" and \\"Like it or Not,\\" a nice song with a good message, but now the album has four ok-but-forgettable tracks rather than three when compared to strength of the rest of the material. <br /> <br />Otherwise, this limited edition offers a completely useless book to \\"write confessions in,\\" along with a book of pictures.  Pictures of the lovely Madonna wearing the same outfit in a hundred different positions page after page. <br /> <br />A book of pictures is all they could offer other than the new song?  And not even a book of varied pictures? <br /> <br />Sorry, but if this edition was releasedwith the non-continuous version of the album along with the new song, plus the lyrics or maybe a bonus remix CD or making-of DVD with the \\"Hung Up\\" video or having thrown in a DVD of her new rockumentary, \\"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret,\\" that would have been brilliant.  Instead, we got nothing but a book of blank pages and a few dozen photos of her in the same outfit, pose after pose...and one ok new song. <br /> <br />The box itself is beautiful and very high-quality, but despite looking much better than the American Life box, it's what is inside that counts, and this limited edition only ranks ever so slightly higher than American Life for at least including a new song. <br /> <br />Overall, another disappointing limited edition release from a woman who could jam-pack something like this with loads of exciting stuff.  Unless you are a collector or a REALLY die-hard Madonna fan, just buy the regular album. <br />

038572179X|5.0|I just finished my first Ian McEwan work, Atonement.  I have to admit that the beginning of the work was the past tense of the verb slow, with endless prattle about this self-absorbed 13 year old and her idyllic family in her idyllic English country mansion.  It was very derivative of Jane Austen -think Emma and Pride and Prejudice.  In the beginning of the novel the word \\"divorce\\" is used and children are admonished  NEVER to use that word again-as if it were the ultimate obscenity, (and indeed it can be to children whose parents are going through it). Then on page 80, a four letter word is uttered, a real obscenity, an Anglo-Saxon reference to a part of the human reproductive system.  At the utterance of the word, the world, as the characters knew it, descended into a chotic and self-destructive mode.  The reader witnesses obscenities of other natures, obscentities that can scarcely be imagined, but were true-really happened (and are still happening today)-blooming like weeds within this idyllic family and the thoughout the entirety of Europe.  McEwan's virtuosity, his uncanny ability to give a true voice to his characters, all of them, without regard to their age or sex, blew me away.   <br /> <br />Robbie, the intellectually gifted son of a cleaning woman, considers changing his career course from the study of literature to medicine.  He muses about what kind of physician he might become-not in terms of specialty but in terms of compassion.  He thought-and rightly so-that his love of literature might make him a better doctor.   <br /> <br /> \\"What deep readings his modified sensibility might make of human suffering, of the self destructive folly of sheer bad luck that drive men toward ill health.  Birth, death, and frailty in between.  Rise and fall-this was the doctor's business, and it was literature's too. He was thinking of the nineteenth century- novel.   Broad tolerance and the long view, an inconspicuously warm heart and cool judgment; his kind of doctorwould be alive to the monstrous patterns of fate, and to the vain and comic denial of the inevitable; he would press the enfeebled pulse, hear the expiring breath, feel the fevered hand begin to cool and reflect, in the manner that only literature and religion teach, on the puniness and nobility of mankind. . .\\"  <br /> <br />Wise words, from a man of tender years.  But Robbie would soon learn that he was not a dispassionate observer, apart from this process of rising and falling.  He would discover too soon, too late, that he, like his imagined patients, was material and frail.  <br />  <br />McEwan's technique of nesting a book within a book, ironies within ironies, blurring the margins between truth and fiction, between the creator and the created, between art and imitative life, was simply breath-taking.  I am hooked.   <br />
B000B7BRMM|1.0|First off, I love Diana Krall, however, this CD is generic sounding and boring.  I heard her sing a Christmas song in the past and it sounded great, so I really looked forward to this CD.  When you listen to it, though, it does sound forced, like she doesn't want to be doing it. Her voice does not sound as good as usual, and I just found it to be dissapointing.  We would have been better off with the music alone. <br /> <br />The cover is no big deal, I don't think its in bad taste at all.
B000A3DFZE|1.0|Hey! Everyone even Eric is allowed to make a buck. After listening to this disc that's the conclusion I came to. I can only speak for myself but I don't listen to Eric to hear him sing I listen to hear him play his guitar. The guitar playing is almost non-existent. The mix on the vocals and other instruments drowns him out when he does play. The songs are OK but none of them really stand out. If I could return this disc I would. I know I won't be listening to it. I was glad when I heard Eric was doing something new and not just another pale imitation of <br />Robert Johnson but this has no bite.  I just can't believe that when they listened to this prior to releasing it they thought it was good. I guess I'll just have to listen to the beano album
B00005JO1Y|5.0|I was one of the first to see this movie in my area, having attended the 11:45 (a.k.a. first) showing of it at my local Carmike cinema. All I can say is, I went expected action, great special effects, as well as an interesting story, and I got it all tenfold. <br /> <br />The sheer scale of this flick is enough to impress even the most dessensitized eyes. You go from the concrete jungle of a city that seems to be mostly computer generated, to being immersed in the bowels of a lost (true) jungle where most of the film takes place, then of course, back into the city again. The cast is excellent, with the severely attractive Naomi Watts leading the pack as Ann Darrow. Adrien Brody also stars as Jack Driscoll, and having absolutely no familiarity with him as an actor, I was quite impressed and surprised that I hadn't seen him elsewhere. Jack Black was a perfect choice for Carl Denham, who is meant to be lovable while also being responsible for much of the bad stuff that happens in the film. The rest of the cast is great as well, and I can't think of a single role that was obviously miscast. <br /> <br />I was very glad I went to see this movie when I did, with a group of moviegoers whose fresh eyes were just as impressed as mine.  <br /> <br />Also, I thought the Christmas trees in the movie were a nice touch, with it being so close to the holidays. By most standards, this is a movie meant for the Summer season.
0694003611|5.0|This is one of my 1-year-old son's favorite books.  I read it to him every night before I put him to bed, and he also likes to fish it out of the book bin and look at it on his own.  I also have fond memories of it from my own childhood.  BTW, the little mouse appears somewhere in every color illustration--it can be a fun game for a toddler to find it!
B00079FUI6|5.0|Now this is the true definition of intriguing drama, remarkable comedy, stimulating mystery and pure brilliance. <br /> <br />With many of the best television show exiting our screens, such as Friends, Sex And The City and Everybody Loves Raymond, the thought of TV started to look dull. Who would have thought that one of the most captivating shows to ever screen on our televisions could have been this amazing? It's stunning and impossible to fault! Everything from the casting to storylines are perfect. <br /> <br />Teri Hatcher is at her best in this, displaying not only her abilities as a dramatic actress but a comedian aswell. She plays Susan, the clumsy single mother, desperate for love and attention of the mysterious, new neighbour, Mike. <br /> <br />Marcia Cross splendidly plays the perfect Bree, who leads people to believe she lives the perfect life with the perfect family up until the revelation that her troubled husband wants a divorce. <br /> <br />Eva Longoria plays the shallow, self obsessed Gabrielle. Searching for meaning in her life, the materialistic Gabrielle finds satisfaction in having an affair with her seventeen year old gardener, John. <br /> <br />Felicity Huffman plays Lynette, the hectic mother of four whose husband is constantly busy at work. Endlessly running after her four children under the age of 6, Lynette tries her hardest to keep the spark in her marriage. <br /> <br />Finally, Nicollette Sheridan plays the serial divorcee Edit, always on the prowl for men, including Susans love interest, Mike. <br /> <br />These five women are incredible together as they unravel the mysterious suicide of the neighbour and best friend, Mary Alice Young (played by Brenda Strong) who narrates from the grave. <br /> <br />Marc Cherry has created, what can only be described as one of the most brilliant series to ever grace our screens. The writing is absorbing and constantly keeps you guessing what will happen next from the unusual opening scene to the astonishing final cliff hanger of the first season. <br /> <br />Overall, this DVD set is satisfying, engaging and packaged in this exquisite 6 disc box set. No disappiontment here.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Little did anyone know that in 1998 a then-unbeknownst Britney Spears would soon become one of the biggest superstars of all time.  On her fourth studio release, 2003's hit album In the Zone, the ultimate princess of pop delivers some of the best-sounding and most sophisticated techno-pop in ages.  \\"Toxic\\" was by far the best song of 2004, hands down, and even the testy critics agreed; had it been nominated for more Grammys it would've won because it's pure pop perfection, period.  Zone opens with No. 1 single \\"Me Against the Music,\\" a perfect club-friendly tune, and closes with Britney Spears' most intimate \\"Everytime,\\" a song she wrote herself as an ode to lost first  love Justin Timberlake.  In between she skivvies through the Deep South (a la \\"I Got That Boom, Boom\\") and to the edge of one's own self-indulgence (\\"Touch of My Hand\\").  The record's remaining ballad, the touchstone \\"Shadow,\\" is one of the best songs here, and Britney sounds tremendous.  Britney Spears may not have the best of voices, but she is a pop performer (not solely a singer as she started on ...Baby One More Time) and she certainly kicks it on In the Zone.

0743442539|4.0|John Le Carre has definitely written a different type of spy book. This is not a book filled with excitement, romance, and <br />heroic adventure. This book, instead, focuses on a divided Berlin during the Cold War. The protagonist, is a burned out, disallusioned British agent by the name of Alec Leamas. The British plan is for Leamas to \\"defect\\" into East Berlin and <br />to provide the enemy with a combination of both accurate and subtlely flawed information that will discredit a key player <br />in the East German spy network.   <br /> <br />  Leamas is a natural for this deception, not only because of <br />his knowledge of espionage, but because his true inherit cynicism towards his career, has made him almost indistinguishable from the character he is pretending to be. <br /> <br />Just remember, this book is not escapist, light reading. The main characters are dark, flawed, and generally depressing. <br />The lines between good and evil are not clearly defined. The spy game is portayed as finding a means to and end, regardless......     <br />
B00005JO1P|5.0|I'm not a country music fan. I only heard about Johnny Cash when he had died (and yes I do live in a box...Joke). But this movie has definitely opened a door and I will be checking more into John Cash. Comparisons can be made with this and lasts years \\"Ray\\". Other than the obvious subject matter (famous singer overcoming personal problems) another comparison is the fact that they both boast great award worthy performances. I hope Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon definitely get recognition for the amazing work in this film. Joaquin gave a very complex performance and he had strong presence. Reese was definitely glowing on the screen. Just from the portrayal of June Carter, I could easily see why Johnny (and me for that matter) would be drawn to her. Reese portrays a strong woman who can brighten up others around her. <br /> Aside from the acting; the direction, production design, and editing is also very accomplished. I wouldn't hesitate calling this one of the year's best picture.
0307276902|5.0|Frey's lyrical prose shines in this autobiographical jaunt through a man's inner turmoil. We pass by and see men wrecked and hopeless, beyond despair, longing to get better. We see intense physical pain, burning romantic love, and a man intensely agonized by the idea of becoming vulnerable to another human being, especially to a point at which he could be hurt.  <br /> <br />A psychological work if ever there was one, \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" is a must-read, and I recommend it highly to friends and strangers alike. Pick up a copy, it's very well-written. Though the lyrical prose is at first off-putting or maybe even shocking, you grow accustomed to it as you wade through this long book. Though it's long, don't let the 400-something pages stop you. Read it - trust me, it's good!
B000002I8D|4.0|Phil Collins had spent about ten years with Genesis before releasing his first solo album.  After starting out behind the drum kit and moving to the vocal position following Peter Gabriel's departure, Phil slowly began to prove himself an accomplished singer.  He had already (in my book) proved himself an exceptional drummer. <br /> <br />By the way, if you like drums you must be familiar with Phil's work outside of Genesis.  Check out Brand X's \\"Unorthodox Behaviour\\" for a shining example of Phil's drumming prowess.  But I digress. <br /> <br />Face Value could very well have been released as a Genesis album at the time.  Its sound is very similar to that of, say, the studio side of Genesis' \\"Three Sides Live\\" with the horns and short, tight, catchy melodies that made both Phil and Genesis world-class famous in the '80s. <br /> <br />I'm not entirely sure why Phil decided to do his own version of the Genesis tune \\"Behind The Lines\\", but as far as his cover of the Beatles' \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", Phil manages to make it his own and fit it into the overall structure of the album without making it sound forced or contrived. <br /> <br />As a whole, Face Value stands as a gigantic solo debut for a well established artist that would go on to even bigger (and people might argue) better things.  Face Value is a timeless example of the power of pop fused with a bit of rock and jazz.  Oh, and having the likes of Alphonso Johnson and the experience of so many years of song writing with Genesis behind him doesn't hurt, either.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|In my opinion, Mariah is the best artist in the world! She puts out great music and she has a beautiful voice! I've had to buy this album three times in order to get all of the bonus tracks currently available (most imports which are costly)! First, of course, the original version in the US! Second, an import consisting of the bonus tracks \\"Sprung\\" and \\"Secret Love\\" which cost $64 plus shipping! Last, the platinum edition, thankfully released in the US for once (Cheaper) and contains the bonus tracks \\"Don't Forget About Us\\", \\"We Belong Together Remix\\", among others! I know that it was my decision to buy all of these copies, but in order to get new music to hold off for the next 2 years before a new studio album release, I kind of had to do so! Anyway, the music is great completely! I would have rather seen Mariah just put the new material on the next album because it's that good! With Island, I believe it's the dumbest decision to do what they have done all year and that's constantly releasing things over and over and over again just for the few bucks when it sells! I'm always going to be there to support Mariah, but this year has been ridiculous for keeping up with new music! I definetly think this album is worth it being a US cost (we don't have a choice for new music anyway now!!!) but if anything comes out again in the future of this same material, I'm going to pass for sure! Also includes a DVD of 4 videos \\"It's Like That\\", \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Shake It Off\\", and the US debut of \\"Get Your Number\\"!!!
B00005JNX0|5.0|In the animated movie Madagascar, the wild is a symbol of freedom.  Different characters have different prospective on this because for Marty it is very much wanted, and because Alex, Melmen, and Gloria on the other hand like the city life. Furthermore, the penguins feel that the animals do not belong in a zoo but in the wild where they came from. <br /> I watched this movie because I enjoy seeing computer animated movies.  My little brother just got it so I thought what a great opportunity. <br /> Marty really wants to go to the wild to run free. He feels his life will always be the same if the stays at the zoo.  \\"I just eat here, then there, then stand over here, and then over there!\\"  Marty told Alex. He is always daydreaming while running on his treadmill inside his exhibit while he stares at the mural on the wall by his exhibit.  During his birthday he wishes that he could one day be free to run in the wild.  The rest of the gang thought he was crazy. <br /> Alex, Melmen, and Gloria do not want to go to the wild for a number of reasons.  Alex, for example, is the main attraction at the zoo, and if he went to the wild nobody would care about him, see, or admire him.  Melmen is a hypochondriac and in the wild he would not be able to get all his special medication he would get if he stayed at the zoo.  Gloria is a hippopotamus so she just likes to relax and eat all day, and what better place to do that in than in a zoo where everyone takes care of you.  There are some other animals in the zoo that have a whole different idea, like the penguins. <br /> The penguins have this crazy military mentality. They think that the zoo and everyone else in the world is against them.  They are always trying to escape. They think that animals do not belong locked up in cages but free to roam the wild where they came from. Their main objective in the movie is to return to Antarctica and be free. <br /> Madagascar is a fun, must see movie. <br />
B000BVD460|2.0|eminem is arguably the best rapper alive, nas or jigga or dare i say lil wayne are all contenders. he is falling off, its like he stopped trying. slim shady lp and marshal mathers lp were fire, and if had he continued to flow like that there would be no question as to whether or not he was the best right now. eminem show was also an excellent cd, not as hard but much more personal and still very lyrical, but then he dropped encore and i dont know what happened, i mean did anybody like this garbage, f@#kin \\"just lose it\\" did people actually like that song, sure a few songs on this cd were ok but \\"puke\\" \\"ass like that\\" is he even trying anymore? its like he made a cd for nickelodeon or something none of those songs are as lyrical as he used to be.  <br /> <br /> And this cd, are u trying to tell me these are his best songs? just listen to the sample for \\"fack\\" i mean what is that. this cd has a few good songs but not his best. at least \\"my band\\" isnt present here. that song is so stupid it makes me want to kill myself.  and this is how hes going to end his career with \\"encore\\" and \\"curtain call\\" i dont believe it i cant believe it maybe he needs to get angry again i dont know but he needs to do better than this.  <br />  <br /> so if ur a fan of the corny songs he made so 13 year olds would go out and buy his cd than this one is for u. fans of \\"without me\\" and \\"just lose it\\" this cds for u, listen to \\"fack\\" u might just cream urself.  <br />  <br /> but if ur a real fan of eminem the old eminem \\"role model\\" \\"drug ballet\\" eminem then i wouldnt waste ur money here. it may be time to start looking elsewhere. lil waynes \\"tha carter 2\\" just came out and is the hardest cd ive heard in a minute, u may not \\"just lose it\\" but u wont be dissapointed.  <br />
0446677450|5.0|August 24, 2005, my 17th birthday. My cousins would take me out and celebate my day. I would get my usual gifts. Money, clothes, gift cards. But this year my older cousin got me a book. \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\". At first I was shocked, a book? a book? Wow! In the book my cousin wrote me a letter. Saying how I can handle the knowledge this book contains. Since I was 17,  he thought it was a good time to learn about the money. It looked boring, and like it was a school book. But my cousin talked about how the rich say rich. This book is good in my situation well because I have a poor dad. So I read the book. It turned out to be good, and not boring. It is about a boy, Robert Kiyosaki. He had 2 fathers, a rich one, and a poor one. His poor dad was highly educated, but not money, never had money to pay the bills, he was in debt, and poor all his life. His rich dad, no education, but he's smart, knows how to handle his money. He had to choose a path to follow, he choose his rich dad. We have to be our own hustlers. The rich stay rich by knowing the difference betwenn as asset and a liability. He talked about his first job, making 10 cents an hour. He gave up baseball games for that. How it made him think it was unfair. The rich dad did this all for a reason, to teach them. Money should work for you, not you work for money. This book teaches me how in the future not to end up in debt. Mostly parents say stay in school, get good grades, get into a good college, and get a safe secure job. Now a days that is the worst thing you can stay to your child. Now they stay in school, get good grades,get into a good college, and get a safe secure job, only puts them to work harder, and end up in debt. Its the most dangerous thing to say. I thank Robert Kiyosaki for this book and now I know, and I will pass this on. I highly recommend people read this book, and pass that on to their kids, friends, family.
B000B8QEYC|1.0|Having been a long time fan like so many other enya listeners, this latest album proved to me that Enya has lost the \\"spark\\" that made her the new age star that she is. I agree with all the other reviewers when they say that this album, along with \\"A day without Rain\\" are merely rehashed versions of her older albums. In my opinion, The Memory of Trees was her last great and original album that blew me away. Orinocco Flow, Shepard Moons, the Celts, and Memory of Trees all had its own uniqueness and took listeners to a brand new world of Enya each time it was released. Songs like Book of Days, Memory of Trees, Orinocco Flow, Alderbaran were some of the examples of Enya's masterpieces. Unfortunately when \\"A Day without Rain\\" came out, I was disappointed to hear the same type of beat that Memory of Trees had used, repeated in that new album. Unlike her other albums, i quickly put \\"A Day without Rain\\" to rest and hoped for Enya to inspire us once again in her future album. Now that Amarantine is out, it has made me a very sad fan to see that Enya and her team has really lost the magic and are simply using the same tones to make new songs. I for one still remain an Enya fan despite the fact. If you are a die hard enya fan and A day without Rain didn't bother you, then maybe you will enjoy this album. But if you agree with my above statement about her previous album, you'll probably wanted to spent the money elsewhere like Moya Brennan, Enya's sister's new album is a nice refreshing sound.
B0000009SM|5.0|5 BILLION STARS to THE POWER OF 5 BILLION STARS!!!!! <br />Verily, I say unto you, this album is a miracle! This one's in my top 3 of best albums ever made! This is an album of rock/bluegrass/prog/fusion/punk/world-music/space-rock/pop/classical/torch-song/heavy metal/EVERY-ROCK and not served up piece-meal a la White Album and every other band would try, but all at the same time! A dense, yet crystal-clear creation of such power! such melodiousness! such intelligence! such humour! - No wonder Zappa couldn't stand the religious and dogma wielding zealouts of all gang members who declare themselves: \\"I'm White I'm Black! I'm prog! I'm garage! I'm Christian! I'm Muslim! I'm American Idol material! I'm satanic Heavy Metal Shredding! I'm this! I'm that: endless opposition creating endless trouble!\\" This man had the musical mind of God him/herself! If God composed an album of music it would be this! And if you don't like Zappa because of his profanity/schatology and his penchant for themes anal, there is none of that there. Zappa must have known that God was proud of what his little boy Zappa was doing here and kept it clean, yet still scathing in its sarcasm. This album is so amazing, so beautiful, (it's making me write like a madman in a feeble attempt to tell people of its greatness.) I've got thousands of albums, but if somebody said \\"it's all those or One Size Fits All! Which do you give up, so that, perhaps, we'll let you live?\\" I'd say, take all the others, and leave me \\"One Size Fits All\\". Thank you Mr Zappa! The day that you died, my life has been a bit more of a drudgery since, and the world has certainly become \\"dumb all over, and\\" very \\"ugly on the side.\\" This album should be required listening at all schools the world over and students should be tested on its contents - only then we might be able to save the world and its Art!
038541627X|5.0|This is a nice collection of some stories by Asimov. I enjoyed the book, as it reminded me some stories which I have read and showed me some new stories, which I haven't read.<br />Asimov's science fiction is very convincing, it makes you feel as if we already live in the future and have unbelievable advanced technologies.<br />In particular, I like the stories:<br />\\"Satisfaction guaranteed\\" - a love story between a male robot (android) and a human female.<br />Asimov strongly implies that in the future we will have robotic spouses.<br />\\"The fun they had\\" - a story about students who find a real book (as opposed to a book in an electronic format).<br />Asimov strongly implies that in the future paper books will be obsolete, and will be replaced by e-books that can be read on a computer.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Every once in a great while, adventure films fall into that rare category of being worthy enough to receive an Oscar nomination for best picture.  JAWS, STAR WARS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, E.T. and THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy all achieved that status (RETURN OF THE KING won!).  In my honest, critical opinion, Peter Jackson's epic remake of KING KONG may now join the class!<br /><br />Movies come out every week.  How many of them do we often find ourselves saying, \\"I'll wait 'till it comes out on DVD or cable.\\"?  KING KONG is more than a mere movie; it is a cinema experience that can only involve the big screen!  Select the best seat, get your popcorn & large soda and get comfortable, because it's glorious, non-stop escapist fun; the kind of fun that, for three hours anyway, can give you renewed faith in the Hollywood movie-making system.<br /><br />In a way, the fact that the story of KING KONG has been so well known for over 70 years is what helps the film along.  We already know the story and what's going to happen.  Things can only go up from there.  While the original 1933 version was all about the stop-and-go motion action of the day, and the 1976 version was all about the latest technology in hydraulics, the 2005 version successfully employs every once of today's CGI magic.<br /><br />The story, as you've probably heard by now, is surprisingly very tender in its relationship between Kong and his love interest, Ann Darrow.  Jack Black's performance is surprisingly credible as Carl Denham.  The action and thrills; hell, they speak for themselves!<br /><br />See KING KONG!  See it now!  See it twice!  See it on the biggest movie screen you can find!<br /><br />Oh, and a message to the reviewer who calls him/herself \\"Happy\\"...This was a remake of KING KONG, a creature/character that has been covered for 72 years!  You were expecting something TOTALLY brand new and original???  You obviously seem incapable of just enjoying this movie for the fun and adventure that it was.

6303212379|4.0|I first saw the Goonies at a slumber party when I was about 9. While I did find it exciting, I also was scared stiff when I saw the severely deformed man/monster thing that was part of the Fratelli family. I can't think of his name right now. I develped a crush on both \\"Mikey\\" and \\"Mouth\\", the cute 11 year olds. I think this film appeals to any kid who likes a good adventure story. The kids try to locate an old pirate treasure in order to come up with the money to save their homes, so that they don't have to leave the goon docks. I don't think parents should let their young kids (those under 9) watch this film. It may scare them a bit, and also there is a lot of foul language.
