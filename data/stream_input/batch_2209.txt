B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much. Looking forward to reading the next book. This book certainly reminds me to appreciate all that I have.
8866130931|5.0|Comes with extra stickers for birthdays, parties, deadlines, etc. Feels good, looks good, has a little envelope in the back to hold papers.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|the led light on this app is strong enuff to read directions,get yourself around the house if power goes out,looking forward to seeing how it works in the outdoors on a camping trip will probably lite up the tent enuff but the dark trails is were im curious tryed others this is the best one so for[[ASIN:B0066WJLU6 Flashlight HD LED]]
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show. Very intertaining and never know what will happen next. Love it....I'm in the process of watching season 3.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Not a bad way to pass some time. Especially if you like hidden object games. Story is pretty weak and almost gets in the way, but very manageable. All in all, fun game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I've only watched the first 3 episodes...love this show. Love the era, the clothing and home. Beautiful castle.  The charaters are fantastic....never know what will happen next.
B006OOHYIC|2.0|You try to erase pegs using a ball that can go in a number of directions, all the while listening to old &#34;new age&#34; music. Neither is to my liking, but having paid for it, I'll wait at least a week before I delete it from my Kindle, and another week before I erase it completely. I don't know why 99 cents should bother me so much, but maybe it's because I fell for the 5 star reviews.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I love how this book takes you there. Feeling every salty breeze, feeling the love as well as the other emotions that come with reading this book
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Very nice app.great when you travel use it as a bedside clock,will show the weather for the whole day. Would use a alarm.. I use my alarm app in the background,works good.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I watched the movie first, but I was sure there was much more to it than what they could show on-screen. Reading the story made it much more close to the heart and I read it all in just a couple of days. The story is very involving!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A marvelous book. Truly proof that Heaven does exit. This book will be a great gift to those I love and wish to share the gift of Jesus Christ and His gift of love and salvation.<br />I will recommend this book to any person who is going through a difficult period in their life.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Good movie,the ending was a little cheesy....but overall good,I would watch it again.I wouldnt pay to watch it again but I would for free.
0307959856|3.0|I have to give James credit for trying, but the character of Elizabeth is just too weak, nearly non-existent, and that's what keeps us Austenphiles rereading the classic.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|There's not much to review....just a very, very entertaining and thrilling book.....I love books like this because the guessing game is something I enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|first I had to reinstall it now the money bags keeps taking all my coins and the eggs are impossible to get.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Another Jack Reacher series novel....and another good read.  Books like this keep you guessing right to the end.  Good entertainment, which is what books like this provide.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I think I'm addicted to this show! Can't wait for season 4 and all the new twists and turns with new characters and plots.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This game is ok. For free it is a really good game. Since its free though it has sought of ad's.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really enjoy Pinterest. It is great to look at all the pictures that people share<br />It is a great site..
B00992CF6W|4.0|You should get it. I like it but the x-box and computer are better but if you don't have one you should get it.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|A real thought provoking page turner about the nature of man, though the fantastic journey of a single man. Wonderfully written!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is fun and gives you much more play time than Bingo Blingo.  2 cards is what I enjoy playing but looking at working my way up to a couple more...
B005K17RU0|5.0|Nice and easy to use. Never lags and usually has somewhat accurate forecasts of my town. I recommend this app fir the fire hd
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This show is not like most medieval shows that I have seen over the years the acting is amazing the plot is amazing everything about the show is just great I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great medieval era show too watch ;)!!
B00AU15HPC|5.0|WHAT A GREAT ALBUM FROM THE VOICE OF THE MOODIES, I EXPECT MORE ALBUMS FROM HIM. THE NEW VERSION FROM THE SONG, IT'S COLD OUTSIDE OF YOUR HEART, IS EXCELENT!
B005RDF2RG|4.0|Shrek is an entertaining twist on the old princess fairy tales.  Some good messages about liking and caring about people for who they are as opposed to how they look.  That said, there are a lot of crass behaviors and jokes in the movie, and watching it with our seven year old definitely had some moments when we were hoping the jokes went over her head.  The crude jokes really didnt add to the movie and I question why this has to be included in movies.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Gorgeous interface, exceptional accuracy. Smooth as silk to append to your personal preferences. Ideal for planning or dodging outdoor events. Temperature indicators are spot on with local news outlets..do
B000VZYPB4|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this. In a world that is topsy-turvee, Big Bang Theory is like a tonic of raucious laughter mucn needed for relief at the end of a long day.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This was worth the money and the wait. There's not a lot of rehashing of past story building to fluff this fine book. There are are you a couple of irrational coincidences that are highly improbable. The plot is well prepared and believable.<br /><br />It's always a thrill to have some of Pendergast's confederates and enemies show up to stir the story line like a mystery blender.<br /><br />Take a ride through this splendid novel, but like most fine books it ends too quickly.
0060557818|4.0|This book kept me interested enough to be curious of what would happen next.  There are some fairly interesting characters and good sense of adventure.  A journey of a man trying to find his true place on this earth and the earth he never new existed.  Not perfect, but good enough to add to my satisfied with book collection.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy/adventure.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|Neat graphics and decent controls but have played the opening several timesand game crashes repeatedly after opening tutorial. Five times is limit so deleting this piece of junk now
B009KG7EMC|5.0|good action and funny just loved it and all the actors in the movies was well put together  was enjooyable
B002JVWR4U|5.0|love the show love anything Josh does!<br />finally got to see the unaired episode which was great!  hate that it had to end
B0095MVOMC|4.0|This is a new focus on the traditional hidden object game.  Some of the numbers are really easy to see, but some are very well hdden.  There are several levels so the game has plenty to offer for the price.  Because every letter in the alphabet is in every scene and some are very well hidden, there is some replay value.  I took off one star because sometimes if you do not click exactly on top of letter you get a 10 second tme penalty.  I have played through every level twice.  I also like their hidden numbers too.
B005LAJ1H2|3.0|this particular set was damaged when i started watching it no reflection on the series itself, what i saw of it was good, however many of the discs keep freezing on me and when i finally got it to move on it had ahead over much of the scenes so i couldn't tell what had happened so it was frustrating. I did see the first season on tv and it was great, I'm sure this was too i just couldn't get this particular set to work properly, so i didn't know what was going on half the time
B009UX2YAC|5.0|please all of you people out there that say the game is bad because of glitches.....sooooo not true it just shows that your device is slow and get a new one. so stop blaming the game for your mistake of buying a device that stinks.......and yea the game is awesome :) :p
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|My daughter, my husband and I all enjoyed watching this movie.  I Highly recommend it for kids 3 and over.
B00BOL0TSM|5.0|The special effects are 2nd to none! I can't believe how real it looks! This show will forever change expectations and raise the bar for TV series. All other shows that have special effects will use this series as a bench mark to judge themselves against because there has never been anything this good for TV and I seriously think this even goes for movies as well.. The special effects and make-up is seriously that good!!and AMC doesn't hold anything back and lets the creative talent from the writers, special effects, director,ect ..tell the story exactly how they in-vision it.<br />IN ANY CASE if you're a horror fan and or a Zombie fan you'll love this series,  and even if you're not and simply want to watch a show that will suck you in with great story lines, amazing actors, great special effects and top notch character development then give this series a chance. You won't be disappointed. By the end of season 2 you will have already thought out in detail what your gonna do when this happens in your neighborhood LOL.
1451624468|1.0|That guy also accepts being paid for his book with banknotes holding &#34;In God We Trust&#34; motto! I think it was better if he focused more on the theoretical side without getting his feet into the dirt of theology!
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Emotional mixed with a stage play set up. The two in my opinion drama and stage play set up did not mix very well. Visual, costumes were fine.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I was skeptical of the plan, but my wife was interested.  The book contained lots of information, counter to my previous knowledge.<br />In the end, I felt great.  My wife and I ate the exact same meals - content and size.  She lost 20 pounds, while I (runner in good physical health) lost none.  These results sold me.  I now believe there is more to a healthy diet than the calorie in / calorie out model.
B000002BYA|4.0|HOW CAN YOU BEAT LIVE PERFORMANCE BY STEVIE.....GREAT TUNES TO LISTEN TO. WICKED GOOD.<br />TRY IT OUT, YOU WILL LOVE IT
B007REV4T8|5.0|Best Jame Bond in last 20 years.  I love Daniel Craig and the movie has action and a story line.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I did not watch &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; back in the day. Now that we are waiting for season 4 of Downton, I ordered the entire set of UD. It is amazing how much of Downton is lifted directly from UD. That is not a criticism, by the way. If you liked &#34;Ballykissangel&#34;, &#34;Monarch of the Glen&#34;, and &#34;Hamish Macbeth&#34; you will probably love Downton, watch one episode and you will likely be hooked.
B005HF0GKC|5.0|I always enjoyed watching Medium every week when it was available on TV. I was so excited to see it available on Amazon Instant Videos.I can now watch the episodes again and even catch upon some I might have missed.Great series, now ready for season2.
B005GSZZ1A|2.0|A bit dreary with not many insights other than Camp 14 which was his life.<br />He didn't seem to make the most of his life in the USA despite much help.<br />Somewhat depressing with no end in sight.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so much fun I cant put it down atalll I luv it what are you doing get the game already
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|It was boring and I don't want to have to spend real money just to get more tokens!<br />A rip-off - sorry amazon.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A seat gripping insight into the life of a Navy Seal.  It was a nice touch to include his wifes comments revealing the stress war puts on a family.  It is not the most well written book, but the content is excellent.  The saddest part is that I was about half way through the book when Chris Kyle was murdered.  So sad that after all he'd been through a whacked out former miliary person takes him out.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I wanted to read this before I saw the movie and I am so glad that I did.  What an amazing story.  I love the way it ended which was not predictable.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I enjoy the storyline and the way that they weave together so many classic fairy tales.  I am a huge fan of sci fi movies and TV so I would highly recommend to anyone else that enjoys sci fi.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|A must see for everyone. The hard truth about what we are eating, where it comes from and what they do to it.
0857860801|5.0|This is a great format for Simon's Cat. Wonderful illustrations, great colors, nice size. I can spend many hours looking at the little fun details on each page. Loved every illustration except for the broken fish tank--poor fishies!
B006O5YIMQ|5.0|This is the best MMA movie out there but it's not really about MMA. It's about family and forgiveness. Great story and great cast.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|this product did not work to transfer content from my laptop. My computer recognized it, but would not work, indicating it was not a correct connection
B002SEQ8ZC|5.0|Great gift set , my daughter was very impressed. I recommend to others.  I would consider purchasing more of the same in future.
B005GIS1SY|5.0|This movie picked me up when I was feeling blue. I love romantic comedies. It also reminded me of my orphaned sparrow who I raised and watched as he brought his girl friends around until he finally left.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game for little ones. My five year old loves this game. Keep up the good work! Will download other games by this company in the future.
B0011MZOEI|5.0|John McClane is one of cinema's great heroes.  Extremely flawed, not necessarily handsome - but somehow, he comes through every time.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I HATE THIS GAME JUST TO UPDATE ROME I HAD TO RESTART MY GAME AND LOSE MY NINJA!!!!! AND I LOST MY ROCKET BOARD IM NEVER PLAYING AGAIN!!!!
B000SZK41M|5.0|The one that started them all.  Complete with explosions, gunfights, fistfights and deadly intrigue.  Throw in Bruce Willis's patented sardonic humor - and this one has classic written all over it.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Not something I liked after I tried to play...I plan to delete it as it requires me to purchase coins  in order to play.
B004HO6I2O|5.0|This is the funniest movie I've seen in a while. A must-have comedy for my collection. I recommend this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. New missions keep the game play fresh, and I am always tryingto beat my high score.  Lot of fun and would definatley recommend.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I like how the orientation in landscape allows you to read the headlines on the left with the full story on the right.  I prefer using BBC to NPR or other news sites because of the content of the articles.  I think they have better reporting and they put a lot of effort into making the app show all the articles.  I would appreciate it if they make the photos in the article selectable so I could see a larger version of them.  Sometimes they are hard to see.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an awesome game! But it is missing one thing changing skins! But still people love it and it's worth seven dollars.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|This conversion is great. Makes the flashlight about twice as bright. It is easier to operate with the push button on the bottom. It is a must upgrade for an maglite.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I thought it was a great movie, full of beautifully damaged characters...  A little cliche, but well acted.  I recommend it!
B00BLGZDVS|3.0|The movie starts out quite well but kind ends on a 'meh' note. Joaquin Phoenix and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are excellent as always. Amy Adams is also quite good as well. It's an interesting take on a man like say.... L. Ron Hubbard and his non-scientific approach to mental illness and its consequences.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I read this book because my book club chose it.  I thought the plot was predictable and contrived.  The association of messages with various flowers was diverting but nothing new.  Many in my book club longed for Victoria to pull up her socks and get in the game.  I agree.  So many other books we could have read.  Too bad.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I started using this after i bought a Roku, and now we watch this more than directv, or any of the streaming services. It seamlessly streams music to my phone, so i have complete access to my entire music library. They kids have it on their tablets, so they can stream what ever program... no more fighting, and i can watch the news when i get home without any whining, because they are watching their tablets. Really awesome little program!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very cool, top of the line game hard to believe that a game this good is free,so realistic. igive it a 10 star and then some.
1452113432|5.0|I loved her TV show and could not wait to get her book. Their are pics of every recipe pretty much which I really look for. The recipes could not be easier and are WONDERFUL, a great book for beginners even! I love, love, love this book!! I am cooking right along!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Learned interesting facts that I was not aware of. Argo was entertaining and this intense movie will keep you engaged.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is great especially for the price. Sometimes the forecast is off by a little but even the weatherman on the news is wrong.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My whole family loves this app! It is super addicting too! Lots of fun taking care of and training the horse!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I have several Andrea Bocelli CD's.  This CD is different in that it has lighter style Italian songs.  Not so formal.  The music accompanying the singing is relaxing - nice piano/keyboard music.  There is a variety of English, Spanish and duets.  Comfortable Tempo - not too dramatic.  I think you'll like it - especially for the romantic spring time ahead!!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Fairy tale characters like you have never imagined them.  Or, well I never did.:)  I would not recommend for kids under 10.  Some scenes can be a little unsettling.
B009FZFONO|4.0|enjoy the storylines but at times there seems to be holes in the plot, actors acting out of character, and lack of continuity.  still this is a great show to spend killing time
B009OYSFDM|4.0|This is a fun show.  It's got just enough suspense to keep you wondering what will happen next with the characters.  It also deals well with moral dilemmas that the characters face.  The fighting scenes are choreographed well.  My husband has become the biggest fan in the house.  If he had rated this, he would have given it a 5 star plus.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|1) There is a reason \\"editor\\" is a profession.  This \\"book\\" is the reason for the prefession.  Good short story (novella) in the opening, lousy long form novel in everything else.<br /><br />2) Science fiction requires some element of self-consistent uhhhhhh, science or technology.  An author doesn't have to go all geeky, just be self consistent and plausible within that created world.  In this created world of SILO we have low powered, ancient overtly transistor radios with jury-rigged antennae not demonstrably different from my parents' foil wrapped B&W TV rabbit ears capable of sending waves up hundreds of yards, through multiple metal doors, over hills, back into metal doors and BACK DOWN....  COME ON!  We also have here, as fundamental to the plot, a 2-4-hell make it a 6 acre cylinder driving into Earth, all conviently plopped over oil, iron, nickle, cadmium, lead, and god knows what other preserves which are mined as part of the plot.  Oh, wait, there are 50 of these convienienly located silos within a couple of miles.  GIMME A BREAK!<br /><br />3) Probably most important, SCI-FY creates a believable and interesting alternate culture with its own idiom and references. Not only is this not true of Silo 18, but Silo 17, and presumably Silo 1-50 are identically the same.  \\"Hundreds of years\\" and complete isolation, Silo 18 people know exactly how Silo 17 is laid out and can communicate without effort with Silo 17 people?  Seriously?  How imaginatively lazy.<br /><br />This is a dumb, lazy bit of SCI-FI ephemeral and perhaps an object lesson in the failure of self publishing (see #1, above)/
B006LSZECO|2.0|Everyone told me to read this book because it is SO good. Well, yes, it was good... until it wasn't.  Not much I can say that has not been said already.  The ending is a dud. I kept flipping back and forth thinking I must be missing pages or something.  The ending is just ridiculous and leaves the reader asking too many questions.  Don't say you weren't warned!
B008OOYALE|3.0|Got this game thinking it would be similar to the bubble shoot I was playing. It is not. Didn't. See anything bad about it. Its just not for me.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|this is a very good, unobtrusive cover for the Kindle; more words, more words, more words, more words, more words
B008PWUYVA|5.0|Kindle fits very well into the case. the grips hold the case in place when using it as a stand. not very bulky so holding it is easy and comfortable.
0756966949|4.0|I haven't read it.  I don't know why.  I love the movie.  I just had to have the book too.  Maybe I will read it to my child someday as a bedtime story.
B004N6369Y|3.0|I enjoyed the book,but there was no real story like other Ds<br /><br />Books.I have read better books by Danielle Steele.I still enjoy<br />Her writing very much.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works very well. I just need the basics and this was the first one I tried. The buttons are nice and big
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love the game but why cant your game be upgraded to keep up with features as your software progresses?  I have a game going on my ipad and one on a kindle fire. each one is very different. would like the newer features on my older game.
B0032CVAQQ|2.0|I think the concept in the book is fine, but it seems like one of those books where once you've read the cover, you've pretty much got the entire concept.
B00530FC6O|4.0|Though a little dated in its colloquial language and its picture of society, this is easy to follow and very amusing for any one entertained by the life of rich fops in England fifty or more years ago. A good introduction to Wodehouse's many books about Bertie and Jeeves.
075666733X|5.0|The Images were colorful and information was informative. It can be used in the classroom as well as at home. Only negative about the book is that the lines and arrows were a bit to small in pointing out the areas being mentioned.
B00459GJUM|5.0|this was the darker adult oriented version of the SG universe, that unfortunately no one apparently asked for.  It was a great show in its own right, but it didn't fit the tone and feel of the SG franchise that I guess the hardcore fans were looking for.<br /><br />The show might have survived on its own if it had been tweaked to not ride on SG's foundation.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Although the plot was easy to determine, I thought this was a cute change from all the R rated movies that we sometimes watch.
B00005YUAC|3.0|In the early 1970s the UK produced many Progressive Rock bands, Yes, Genesis, Uriah Heep, King Crimson and Jethro Tull to name just a few.<br />Camel debuted their self titled album in February 1973 with 7 tracks, this 2002 CD adds Never Let Go in the single version and Homage To The God Of Light, live from the Marquee Club, London, on 29th October 1974.<br />The sounds are guitar and keyboard driven, with some Jazz type input similar to early Chicago, especially on Homage To The God Of Light, which runs to 19 minutes.<br />All in all a competent start to a career which has continued for 30 plus years.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A must see!!  You will love Downton Abbey.  There is a twist around every turn.  Each episode will keep you watching!
B00992CF6W|5.0|you must get the game .evan know it is $7 its awesome you can get updates and get armor and new bricks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is very Fun I think it's good for all ages to enjoy with friends or family...I would recommend this to everyone.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Excelente, buen servicio y buena calidad, lo recomiendo ampliamente, puntuales al entregar los pedidos y muy profesionales, quede encantado de todo lo que me dieron.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is amazing and fun for anyone any age. It's not the best  app ever, but it's an exciting fun game after a hard day of work. It takes a very long time to purchase and install unfortunately. The truth teller behind the scenes speaks.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Excelente, buen servicio y buena calidad, lo recomiendo ampliamente, puntuales al entregar los pedidos y muy profesionales, quede encantado de todo lo que me dieron.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love your game.I think it's very fun with all the upgrades and stuff.I think you are giving kids an idea to explore the world when they play this game and they see what different parts of the world are about. I just love your game and I hope you come out with more.
B00498YZH8|5.0|What I enjoyed most about this movie was the superb acting by every person in the movie without exception. The acting was so well performed that it was as though you were watching actual lives unfolding rather than a scripted movie. The plot was not one that hit you over the head, but there were surprises. These served to give you a deeper understanding of the culture, the characters, the reasons why -- and most importantly, respect for the character portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence and anger for the circumstances in which she found herself. The movie left me with a feeling that I would like to go visit this family 5 years in the future to see if they truly made it out of their circumstances and if their lives improved -- and were their struggles worthwhile or in vain? What does a happy ending look like in this kind of a life? I wonder....
B005SFR7YE|4.0|Everything was perfect except.. I would be better if it's in HD like the snipbits I saw in YouTube. Sucks that you've seen a better one and then you see a lower quality one. I don't have a BlueRay player that's why :/ still a masterpiece though!
B0074ALZ7Q|3.0|nothing special. Took me few pages to get use to the style of writing. Overall is OK, specially if you are keen on long descriptions of scenery and such.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Great movie....a must watch! Been wanting to see it so decided just to give it a go and wow was it worth it. Just do it.
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|For starters I am almost always willing to take a chance on anything, any film that the madcap actor (and my muse the late Hunter Thompson's friend) Johnny Depp puts his name to. With rare exceptions (the big one being his role as that self-same Hunter Thompson in the film adaptation of his book Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas) I have not been disappointed. And while I was not disappointed here the story line, and the antic -laden thriller did not do justice to his, or co-star Angela Joie's (she of the big lips in the title), talents.<br /><br />After all how hot and bothered is one to get over the whereabouts of a crackerjack thief, dough thief, big dough, billions and that is big dough even today, from a British gangster, and from the British tax boys looking for their graft, named Alexander Pearce anyway. And also constantly following a beautiful woman with big luscious red lips and a quaky English accent and who is filled to the brim, filled I tell you, with ennui looking to meet her man. And of course that gangster, that nasty gangster full of hubris and quirky habits. The problem though,  and this may have to do with the nature of star power and Hollywood's take on it, is how far into the movie will it take to figure out who that Mister Pearce really is. Guess?
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Accurate weather updates, alerts to severe weather, maps. It's everything weather all in an app that is very easy to use.
B00BGZ8OLA|2.0|The first 30 minutes was interesting and well done, but to think that Ang Lee deserved the academy award over Spielberg is unbelievable.  I found the  movie to be boring,  despite the cinematography.  The twist at the end added very little.  Don't waste your time.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|While sometimes difficult, this game is still fun. It's worth a download. Getting 3 Stars on every level is always my goal and I found some of the levels to be fairly easy.
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|Great, great new release by the Polish prog masters. Love the minor details in each song. And, that , I think is their strong suit, they create good songs, with each member contributing greatly. Although , as compared to ADHD where the keyboards stand out, I think the bass playing of Mariuz really stands out on this release. This release ranks up there with their previous cd's. It sounds like Riverside but IS different then ADHD and their earlier stuff. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It's very easy to use. I love that it supports multiple accounts. I've not had any problems with this app.
B009K6DKTS|3.0|Taleb has a compelling set of views to put on building and maintaining robust systems as opposed to trying to predict every event which might stress them.  However, like many management style books, a good idea is repeated rather too often.  As well, his egocenricity - which is at first amusing - begins to grate by half way through the book.
B002GAR3AM|3.0|This season had its moments. It was basically The Bette and Tina Show. Helena and Kit had no real storylines and Max's was just ridiculous. While there were some very funny moments, this season was very scattered and could've been written better.
0525478817|5.0|You knew this story was going to be sad, but the journey that the two characters took along the way made the anticipated sadness much easier to accept.  I loved the intricate writing and the way the dialogue was full of interesting words that were sort of &#34;made up&#34; by the main characters.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is wonderful for any Christian. Almost every Bible translation is available, you can highlight and bookmark verses, the reading plans are wonderful ...can you tell I have nothing bad to say about this app?
B006UUL5TY|3.0|This was a pretty tasty little concert with a great selection of Mott hits.MIck Ronson looks a bit under-used but its so cool to see him again.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I haven't read this book in years. It's brilliantly written and worth reading if you never have before. It's a classic.
0143034901|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book & there's very little I could fault with it. This novel is set in Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War & as I'm not familiar with this event or city it intrigued me to find out about it whilst enjoying a great novel. This is a deserved best-seller which deserves your attention.<br />Highly recommended.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This is one of the most amazing movies I ever saw.<br />I enjoyed the pictures and can only congratulate the producer of this visual experience. Enjoy it on a large TV.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Worth watching. Compelling and developing storylines keep the show moving forward. Character actors draw you into their protrayals. Sorry I waiting so long to get onboard.
B00756GKBA|5.0|Not much to say...it is Madonna.. That is already enough to guarantee a fantastic collection of songs.<br />Actually bought this CD quite a while agoo but still love to hear her songs over and over again.<br />Fantastic
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watched this on my smart tv and it was not good.  The shows are great but my amazon prime does not work very well. It stops alot and does not go any further..shuts down..ugh!
0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist's main protagonist is a young man who starts out as a shepherd.  The young man is only known to the reader as \\"The Boy\\", he is never given a name.  The boy wonders about a dream he has had twice in a row.  He sees a gypsy to read his future and then meets a strangely dressed person claiming to be a King.  He is encouraged by both to search for the treasure that is in his dreams.<br /><br />There were many things in The Alchemist that come up that I am able to relate with in life. The Alchemist, although fiction, is written with much wisdom, and mysticism.  The Alchemist is such a good book that the whole time I was reading it I kept thinking \\"After I am done I will read it again\\"  because there is just so much in the book to grasp and understand.  I have not read it a second time but it is a book I plan to keep and read again maybe once a year.<br /><br />I truly find nothing wrong with the book.  There is maybe things I disliked about the story like the surprising ending.  Still does not ruin the greatness this book shows.<br /><br />The Alchemist is a tale for those still looking for themselves and their life's treasure.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was a little predictable but over all, a great book. I would recommend this book and will be finding more from this author.
B004NOH9LC|3.0|In the first 15 minutes, we actively dislike the Rachel McAdams as a horrendous and self-absorbed television person who would really rather talk to work than the guy she's on a date with.  Later she's obnoxious on a job interview to an obnoxious and indifferent Jeff Goldblum who verbally chases her out of his office but inexplicably gives her the job.  She ends up managing a self-righteous martyr Diane Keaton and a condescending and annoying Harrison Ford who unsurprisingly isn't a newscaster anymore.<br /><br />This film is littered with unlikeable people who put themselves in situations entirely of their own making.  But it's free with Prime so if you don't have anything else AT ALL to watch and you need to kill 2 hours, watch this to feel better about your current friends.
B00AEJM6H2|1.0|was going fine but then just quit, downloaded again and still would not work.. very disappointed was enjoying the game
B0077EBWVI|2.0|Stupid remake of a great movie.  Same crap from the first movie happens to Ren, only without his mother this time.  I watched 45 minutes of it, then wandered off to do something more interesting: scrubbing out hardwater stains in the toilet.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|was working fine, then one afternoon three months later stopped working. was unable to pull pics from it or use it . Lost all the pics in the file , deleted it, installed again, and nothing, just kicks me back to carousel when I try to access it. Pics are can not be found through the camera, or on kindle, only if i try to load to Facebook, but then they will not upload.. annoyed.
0871404133|5.0|Based on his lifetime of work in evolutionary biology, Wilson guides us through what major steps our species (and previous hominoids) took to get to the complex 'eusocial' human civilizations that permit our species to dominate the world. Using analogy to ants/bees/wasps (other eusocial species) he shows how these complex behaviors arise without complex brains. But the latter permit us to be self-aware.  Our civilizations are complex interactions of individualism and altruism and that group level evolutionary forces are fundamentally responsible for our successes. This complexity will always be us and whether we destroy the world or adapt to it is not certain.<br />Wilson wrote this work for the lay audience but cannot get away from being a scientist, so some folks might have difficulty in working through the jargon (though he explains it along the way).  He does lay out the various aspects of his overall thesis at a number of points along the way and repeats them as appropriate. In the end, you feel you have been given an extraordinary lecture.  Definitely, this is Wilson's tour-de-force.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|More fabulous Castle! Fun, light (most of the time), whitty, funny and adorable! I can't get enough of Castle! I was unsure about how the show would work with Beckett and Castle together but the writers have been able to keep an element of tension and fun to it and it's still really good!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just as good as the first season, if not even better. More comedy, more changes, and more more more of everything.

I've used avast! on my pc's for years and trust the program so when it came time to add security to my Kindle, there was really no contest. The program is updated frequently, does what it's supposed to, and stays out ouf you way. What more could you ask for?

B008GVSOCQ|4.0|Sound was not as clear as one would like. Casting was superb. We love Jane Austen books. Love the happy ending!
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|Excellent story.  A man's (J Phoenix) steep downward journey of self-destruction and alcoholism was sometimes difficult to watch.  I love all the actors in it, especially PS Hoffman and A Adams who were dynamic.

B00069YDXU|5.0|than the welcome back, or Live at the royal albert hall. Again, go for content, excellent video, sound is great! Nice to see different material here in the last 90's ELP show, in front of a (what I suspect) was primarily a canadian jazz crowd.Looked to me like the crowd was in to it!<br />Would again, highly recommend to any existing ELP fan.Not truly as representive to a new fan as welcome back DVD would be ,which showcases ELP from the early years, to the amped up brainsalad years, and a glimpse of a more conservative, with class ELP on the works tour with the orchestra.<br />Buy it, it sounds good,looks good. Shame that a few low reviews got at the beiginning, if you read this far-you will not be dissapointed.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Exactly like season ons. A great read.<br />Can't wait for the next in the series. And season 3 on Nov.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A truly amazing story that shows you that God can take the wretched people, and turn them into great men of God.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|This is the best and most beautiful music I have heard in years!  I loved every single song on it, except for the last two tracks, which were just ok.  (They were remakes of a song I liked better in its original form.)  I liked this album so much that I bought copies of it for friends and relatives.  If I could afford it, I would buy copies for everyone I know.
B002C5B56E|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a very moving love story. It shows that love is love, no matter the gender, age or any other defining characteristic of lovers. It is a great example of why our country should pass marriage equality legislation!
B00499QUK2|5.0|A delightful escape into a contemporary take on Sherlock Holmes. Adventurous, humorous, and entertaining! I only wish there were more episodes.

B007IK44CK|4.0|There is an interesting mix of humor and intrigue. I enjoyed it as entertainment, but the humor kept it from being especially suspenseful. But it's good for a temporary escape from the real world.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed all the books. The story transcends any critiques anyone can make. There are writers and there are storytellers. This was a story that needed to  be told. Love it or hate it you're still talking about it. I loved it all and would recommend if this is your cup of tea. If not move on to something else.
0425263908|3.0|I felt like I was reading fifty shades except and more twisted and ask version. But, it's pretty much the same story line. It's an okay read. But, I feel like its too much like fifty shades.
B004M5HUXE|5.0|One of my favorite novels of all time. I love this book so much and as I plan to build a collection for my home this one will for sure be on the shelves.
B0095P29EG|5.0|The quality was excellent. This is a visually stunning movie that deserves your time to watch and enjoy. Very well done.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|As soon as we saw the movie, I knew I wanted the score. It is gorgeous! Have uploaded it to all of my music players.
B000QCQ9O8|4.0|A sad story, but enjoyable to read. Also enjoyed being able to use the Audible.com audio book at the same time as the Kindle books for so WhisperSync works across both, allowing me to jump back and forth between reading and listening without losing my place. Awesome feature!

B009IF8CH6|4.0|I have loved Big Bang Theory from the beginning but it's starting to seem like same old, same old this season. I would like to see Sheldon's and Amy's relationship move forward and I'm really tired of the Leonard/Penny thing. I hope they shake it up a little more next season.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Ben Affleck truly does a great job telling this true story of the other Iranian hostages.  You will not regret the time spent watching.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|very nice cover and my wife loved the red color<br />very nice constrution just a very nice cover all the way around
B005LAIIQC|4.0|This is a very good film that I enjoyed watching. Renner plays a great and gritty super-agent and he fits the role perfectly to me. The blu-ray quality is very good. I wish it wasn't shown in letterbox, but that's a small gripe. It also doesn't have that many special features. Me personally...I was hoping for a more indepth Bourne review, so those who aren't familiar with the first three movies could get a recap. As it is, if you haven't seen the first three films I think you will be completely lost. It also makes it a bit complicated because Bourne Legacy is taking place at the same time as Bourne Ultimatum, which is the film previous to this Bourne installment. I have seen the first three films and I had to rewatch them because it was very complicated to follow the story in Bourne Legacy. You get the general gist that Renner is trying to get his super soldier drugs, but there is a lot going on that is more subtext and winks to the previous films. If you haven't seen them or you don't remember them then it's probably a good idea to catch up on them. Overall, this was a good movie and I would ignore the haters who want to find fault with it. The super-soldier part is very believable in the context of the film and it adds some intensity to Renner's chracter. Rachel Weisz is also very good and I don't mind that she just stands around waiting for Renner to save her. She's not the action star here and I liked the chemistry between them. I hope there is a sequel with these two in it. I'd definitely watch.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I haven't read Safe Haven yet.  I am saving it for when we go on our cruise the end of this month.  I have read everything Sparks has written so I am sure I will be very happy with this book.
B00BLGZDVS|3.0|A little less than one would expect from this cast. Weak story line. I always expected this movie to take me someplace but it never became airborne.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|When we sold our minivan my husband had a senior moment and left all our favorite CDs in the storage area.  We are in the process of replacing them.  Brothers in Arms is the first one.  Thank you for having it available for us to purchase.
1616550414|5.0|This book is everything I imagined it would be and more. In depth illustrations and (finally) a somewhat coherent timeline of the entire series!!! Definitely worth it for hardcore Zelda fans
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This book is deeply disturbing on every level. Do not read this book if you have school age children. That being said, it was well written, and thought provoking. It also left me bereft. Having a son with mental illness, I could relate.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|My boys really, and I mean really like this app. I on the other hand felt it to be repetitive. The graphics are great and the concept of the game is one that I've come across with regularly, yet out of the similar games I liked this ne the most.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I ordered it and couldn't beat the price for blu-ray, dvd, and digital copy-- we enjoy this movie, so funny!  I definitely recommend!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Terrible case,no one can hear you when your on you're phone. Sent the item back. Would much rather use defender case.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love this Author, and the character Jack Reacher. What a great series of books. He can't write them as fast as I can read them. These books do not have to be read in order, but I do recommend it. This author reminds me of John Sandford and his style of writing. Keep up the great work Mr. Lee Child.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I wanted to read this before I saw the movie.  I'm so glad that I did.  It's one of the best Nicholas Sparks books I've read....and that's saying a lot!  Now I'm ready for the movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to read numbers, it fills the whole screen. I like the way it keeps the tally on what you enter. They can be deleted as wanted/needed. I do recommend.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|I had heard that Skyfall was like the old James Bond movies with Roger Moore.  There was none of that glitz, glamour and romance that made them so much fun.  It was a good movie, but not what I had been led to believe, which always disappoints.  You expect more when something has been hyped.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Denzel Washington can do no wrong in my book. He is my favorite actor, and he doesn't disappoint in this film.
B00AEFVRB2|5.0|This movie is hands down one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is dark, complex, full of betrayal, human selfishness, and depth. I have watched it several times now - and all the actors are just superb! This movie explores the human limit of darkness, and how things only seem bad, and then just keep getting worse. This movie is well made - no scene is wasted.<br /><br />I think that the real culprit of the events originates with the character of the mother. It is the absent character, and this character start the events years before they take place. Killer Joe is just a benefactor of the absent mother's original darkness/ fault - and in many ways he is there to salvage what is best in the dysfunction of the family. I keep coming back to what is killer Joe really a killer off? He is able to judge the situation correctly right away, and sees the unspoken truth. His stare hurts because he sees down to the uncomfortable truth and inner being. He gives a choice, and he provides what was asked for - at a price of course. (I will never look at a chicken leg the same again! A classic!)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a fantastic portrayal of a bygone era. We could use some of the honor that so many people held dear then, and that has mostly disappeared in our modern era. And don't kid yourself. The huge disparity between classes is still alive and well today unfortunately.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Uh...every women's dream, fantasy and everlasting hope. I can't wait to read more books from Mira Lyn Kelly. Stay at home mom's day just got better!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Anyone trying to format their ebooks from a word processing program will have difficulty. The conversion program is a work in progress, so those who don't know HTML will likely experience some issues. If Amazon would use EPUB like the rest of the ebook industry, that would be a step in the right direction. Since Amazon is the 8,000 pound gorilla in the ebook industry, it's likely they will continue to impose Mobi on self publishers - even though EPUB is better suited to the task in my humble opinion.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Classic Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. They are a great duo. They need to do a lot more movies together!
B009Z5975A|5.0|Three great movies to enjoy from our childhood!  Goonies and Gremlins.....how can you go wring and all 3 together!  Excellent!
B003OUXECE|5.0|All I have to say is that if you played Bioshock and loved the games as much as I do than you must do yourself a favor with reading this book. It fleshes out the characters and story even further with some origin stories and more details about how Rapture was made and what brought the Utopia world into a Distopian future.<br /><br />Lastly you get a great look into the Big Daddies and Little Sisters!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely love this book! Never thought I would enjoy this type of book. E.L. is an amazing author! Can't wait to read the 3rd one!
B0086449YA|5.0|This is Mark - I love the man's music and this one is yet another excellent collective of his musical talent. The man is gifted, no doubt.<br />Ballads and stories, melodies and soulful vocals - ah, love it!

B0089LOKHG|3.0|Requiem picks up right where Pandemonium left off, with Lena trying to figure out her feelings for both Julian and Alex, and with the Resistance trying to decide their next move.<br />The author chose to write this book in an alternating POV, juxtaposing Lena and Hana's situation. Lena was lived in the wild, an outsider,  a diseased uncured, whereas Hana was cured, living in predictable, chaos-free and peaceful life. It soon became difficult to ascertain whose life was more chaotic and unsafe.<br />The one thing the Book of Shhh never addressed was the people who got the vaccine, but the cure didn't really take. Who did the vaccine fail, Hanna or her Fianc&eacute;? I look forward to seeing how Hana overcomes the fallout from her deviation from her fianc&eacute;'s choices for their future. I will read her book because her story became really riveting as it went along. I think Hana's bravery and leadership will exceed Lena's.<br /><br />Things were revealed in this book, but a lot of things were left hanging, so don't expect all the \\"questions\\" to have a nice gift wrapped answer. Some were addressed, and some were left to be dealt with in the future. The one thing that remained was Lena and Hana grew bravery and fought harder. The Resistance finally made their big move and the fragile wall separating the Wild/Uncured from the Society/Cured came down. I will admit I thought was a tad anti-climactic, but on second thought, I  realized that this wasn't the ending. It was actually a New Beginning. This was Phase Two of Lena and Hana's lives.<br />In addition, the Resistance incurred some devastating losses, so it will be interesting to see the new leadership and how they cope with the loss of some key figures.<br /><br />The writing in this one was similar to the previous books, a little predictable but still very fluid and enjoyable. I was not pleased with how the author dealt with the Love Triangle and I thought it was just flat. Okay, I will give the author kudos for not taking the cowards way out and killing Alex and Julian so I didn't think the author did a good job of justifying the couple she left us with. I would have liked a cleaner rationale as to the why of Lena's choice, but in the end, both were good heroes.<br /><br />Overall, the addition of Hana's POV really elevated this story from okay to pretty intriguing. I was satisfied with direction the story is headed.e cowards way out and killing Alex and Julian so I didn't think the author did a good job of justifying the couple she left us with.

B000OJFV4C|4.0|I love the acting and the sets.  However, I would have liked less nudity and sex, but I guess that's what happens when it is Showtime produced.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This review concedes that the TV series strays deliberately from the comic.  If you're a purist, you may not like some of the changes (though by season 3 I'm guessing you're on board with that much).<br /><br />The only problem still plaguing this show, to me, is that the writers don't seem to know what to do with their time between predesignated plot points.  As a result, we the viewers have to endure a handful of lackluster episodes between two meaningful ones.  I wish they'd compose their plots a little more tightly so we didn't have to deal with the duds.<br /><br />One notable improvement over seasons one and two is character writing.  In Seasons One and Two, the characters made unreasonably noble decisions, and raged over what amounted to trivium, all for the sake of drama.  (The opening of Season Two is especially guilty of this, as our protagonist leaves a girl in the woods while pursued by zombies because &#34;he gets winded&#34;, making no sense at all.)  But in Season Three, our cast has resigned to the world in which they live, and they are attuned to survival instead of upholding some abstract, irrelevant ideals.  They're flawed people now.  Season Three also treats us to the governor, a Machiavellian figure who rules Woodbury by public perception taking priority over benevolence.  His lack of scruples are no surprise to the comic veterans, but I'm afraid his character became muddled on the television series.<br /><br />While the cast and props department are practically flawless, the show could still use some improvements in the writers' room.  If they would omit the more obvious attempts to compare their characters' plight with one another, and stick to a cause-and-effect platform, this show could really take off into greatness.  I don't regret buying it, but I still hope for some improvement next season.<br /><br />PS: For any comic purists worried about how they dealt with Michonne, she's awesome.  Seriously, they did good by her.

This is a wonderful case, worth the risk of buying online.

B00B5HQLMI|4.0|These last Bond films starring Craig are the most psychologically screwed up. That makes them awfully interesting.<br /><br />M is played as a woman who has learned to let nothing, not even the lives of her agents stand in the way of her missions. Bond, oddly (or perhaps not) has formed an attachment to her that transcends the norm. She too, seems to have an alarming tie to him, yet has no hesitation sacrificing him. A decision I found immediately questionable. Her best bet was not to disable or kill her senior agent who actually had his hands on the target.<br /><br />We learn more about Bonds' childhood, though only a few details, and more innuendo than clear detail. A damaged child, childhood trauma, ripe for the picking as it were when M came dangling the carrot.<br /><br />Mentioned more than a few times as if he is worth remembering (?) if not worth saving...Ronson, who is in the first office scene dying. I can't help but wonder who is he? Have I forgotten him? There is the requisite high number of persons killed along the way who aren't mentioned at all.<br /><br />I suppose that Q is sort of quirky and cute-ish in a Dr Spencer Reid sort of way, and Ralph Fiennes is always good to watch.<br /><br />The shaving scene was not sexy. Big fail there. No chemistry. Obligatory flirting, except for the one anemic try at her bra, more like a man and woman discovering they don't like each other sexually much at all, no matter how hard they tried.<br /><br />The beautiful Miss Moneypenny should have had the balls to make her own decision about the shot where she hit Bond. As the agent in place she new her chances and the situation better than M. That is one of the things that makes Bond such a good field agent, he thinks on his feet, and he has the nerve to do as he thinks necessary instead of just doing as he's told.<br /><br />Loved the dramatic explosions, and the insane Silva (Javier Bardem), I found myself curious why he was chosen besides his beautiful voice and captivating acting. His asymmetric features and the horrible prosthesis I suppose made him an ideal, nauseating bad guy. A psychopath nurtured in M's breast and not a little bit by her own hand.<br /><br />The much touted Silva/Bond chest stroking scene was understated, Bond entirely unfazed, barely surprised, and certainly not panicked. Pretty clear it wasn't going to make him freak out. Not as courageously horrifying as the Casino Royale naked scene, Bond tied to a fenestrated chair with the knot swinging bad guy.<br /><br />Is it only on the AIV that the sex scenes are only hinted at and cut rather harshly after a few vague seconds? Why include those disconnected bits at all?<br /><br />So. I did enjoy the viewing. Still think Casino Royale is the best Craig-as-Bond offering. Was sorry to see Judi Dench leave. But nice to meet the new Q. I half expected Q to reach over and give Bond the thigh squeeze rather than Silva later on. (I could see Benedict Cumberbatch in the role).<br /><br />Fewer fantabulous gadgets than earlier Bond films. And the repeated emphasis on being too old got to me. Annoying. Experience has to count for something. Well, part of that equation was put to bed by the demise of M. Yet there looms the question, how much longer will Bond be able to cut it as a double O?<br /><br />But...go for it, it is worth a viewing or two. Especially if you hold a marathon of all the Craig Bond movies.<br /><br />nei

1476712042|3.0|I love the book cover. I love the summary on the back, but the story...I'm still currently reading this, so the jury's still out on that. Some of the story lines don't seem like believable fiction. The female character seems weak, especially for the guy who is a total jerk, but still has her attention. Nothing she does seems to come from a position of strength. She doesn't say no to things which is good to keep the story going, but it's not that inspiring.

160774273X|5.0|Wow. I'm very pleased with the dozen loaves I've baked so far, which have all turned out far better than my expectations. I don't know if I'm just following the recipe and suggested techniques better than I've done in the past, but something's definitely working. I'm actually producing loaves like the one on the cover!<br /><br />First, I do like Forkish's suggested timing to help out those of us who work. The book suggests, for example, mixing the dough at 8am, proofing at 1pm, and baking at 5pm, and offers strategies for timing.<br /><br />Second, the author strongly suggests using a Dutch oven, but don't let this deter you from buying it. I don't have a Dutch oven and I'm getting great results from baking pans (cake tins for the boules) or loaf pans. I just cut the baking time down a little and introduce a little steam in the oven when I put the loaves in.<br /><br />The doughs are quite wet, and the standard technique is the no-knead method. I haven't tried any of the recipes with my mixer yet.<br /><br />Forkish keeps the process very simple, as the title implies. He does not even call for hard to find or more expensive flours. Most of the recipes can work well with all-purpose flour. The downside to that is that you will need to eat the bread within three to four days, or freeze it. Each of the recipes makes two good sized loaves, and I've been giving away my extra loaves to neighbors and friends (very well received). Another thing I've done is to divide the dough into one loaf and three or four pizza dough balls or rolls. The recipes are quite adaptable.<br /><br />What fascinates me with some of the recipes is that he has you put the dough in the fridge overnight to proof and rise, and then go straight from the fridge to the oven. I've never had such dramatic &#34;oven spring.&#34;<br /><br />I've baked bread from scratch for quite a long time now and I still managed to learn a lot from the first half of the book, which discusses the science and history behind baking bread.<br /><br />I compare the book to Peter Reinhardt's &#34;Bread Baker's Apprentice&#34; and the &#34;Tartine Bread Book.&#34; This book is better because it is more accessible and to the point. My results have been far better, but I'm not sure if that's due to Forkish or if it's just that I'm becoming more experienced (I suspect the truth is somewhere in between).<br /><br />Good luck. Feel free to comment or ask questions.

B00004HYLF|5.0|You could not tell me I wasn't cool. Me and my friend Lynn loved Return To Forever. This album along with Ronnie Laws's \\"Pressure Sensitive\\" was my gateway drug at age 17 in 1975. I think this album is really the genesis of all I love in music. I love extended jams as in a jazz but must have that howling axe too.<br />  Now that I finished my tour down memory lane, my favorite cut on this album is the title cut. I just play the music and see if I feel something. There is a segment on this peice where Mr.Clark is bowing his bass and having interplay with Al on guitar, I think I weep every time now.<br />  I must admit the first time I played it again in many years, I thought to myself you definately need some weed for all of the synth work but that passed and I am back to sheer enjoyment. By the way,this is one of those albums that I played the color off and had to leave it alone for quite a while. On the same list is U2 \\"Joshua Tree\\", Alanis Morrisette \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", Handel's \\"Messiah\\", and if I play \\"Soul Power\\" by James Brown one more time, I know something.
B004GYY714|5.0|works well, sometimes it start sounding like a walkie talky.  But over all it has many stations, I listen to on phone and my kindle.

0812984412|4.0|The uphill climb for its first half is more rewarding: the challenge invigorates you to keep going. It accelerates into the curve, and through its central section. Out of that turn, it's downhill. The novel's easier to read, moves rapidly, but there's a sense of anti-climactic ennui. That may fit well the nature of David Mitchell's investigation of repetition and reincarnation, all the same.<br /><br />This entry covers the passages explicating the themes I found most intriguing. It doesn't delve into the \\"Russian doll\\"-structure inspired by Italo Calvino's \\"If On a Winter's Night a Traveller\\" (as I suspected long before learning Mitchell in 2010 via The Paris Review credited that novel I loved thirty years ago) for the 1-2-3-4-5-6 then reversed arrangement--as this is now common knowledge.<br /><br />\\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing\\" features a Melville tone: \\"Typee\\" is mentioned later on. South Seas are visited by an American notary from the new city of San Francisco as the Gold Rush erupts. Afflicted by a worm entering his brain carrying a mysterious malady, Adam falls into the care of one Dr. Henry Goose on the voyage on the \\"Prophetess.\\" The style flows easier than much of (the later) Melville: \\"As Henry & I ate supper, a blizzard of purplish moths seemed to issue from the cracks in the moon, smothering lanterns, faces, food & every surface in a twitching sheet of wings.\\"  (39) We later find a typically casual recurrence of an image in the central story on the Big Island of Hawai'i: \\"Papery moths blowed thru her shimm'rin' eyes'n'mouth too, to'n'fro, yay, to'n'fro.\\" (264)<br /><br />\\"Letters from Zehelgem\\" might have been penned by John Banville or Julian Barnes. It's the type of contemporary novel that's shortlisted for a Booker Prize--as Mitchell a two-time nominee may know well. In the early 1930s, composer Robert Frobisher flees Cambridge, debtors, and justice by presenting himself in Belgium as an amanuensis to his elderly counterpart, and soon rival of sorts, Vyvyan Ayrs. Frobisher's flight from apprehension to Calais sums up his spirit: \\"Dover an utter fright staffed by Bolsheviks, versified cliffs as Romantic as my arse and a similar hue.\\" (46)<br /><br />The tattered book he finds in Ayrs' manse, or half of it, is Ewing's journal, published by his son. In turn, \\"'Half-Lives': the First Luisa Rey Mystery\\" continues the saga as the recipient of Frobisher's letters back to England, Rufus Sixsmith, returns at the age of 66. He's a successful nuclear physicist in the late 1970s in California. But he's restless in Buenas Yerbas (a reversal of an early placename for S.F., by the way.) \\"West, the Pacific eternity. East, our denuded, pernicious, enshrined, thirsty, beserking American continent.\\" (89) His career and his stance on this energy does not please a sinister (naturally) Seabrook corporation. Out of this, one \\"Hilary V. Hush\\" generates a pulp thriller, full of chases and conspiracies.<br /><br />\\"The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish\\" takes us to that middle-aged, put-upon middle man, in contemporary England, who runs a feeble \\"author partnership\\" press: in its slush pile lands the first Luisa Rey mystery. He deals with the aftermath of a cause celebre where the writer of \\"Knuckle Sandwich\\" meets sudden notoriety, and the attention generates fame and profits for Cavendish. Flush with the proceeds, all seems it will go well, until it doesn't.  Kingsley or Martin Amis might be at home here. Consider this look as Timothy must flee from London: \\"you sly toupeed quizmaster, you and your tenements of Somalians; viaducts of Kingdom Brunel; malls of casualized labor; strata of soot-blackened bricks and muddy bones of Doctors Dee, Crippen, et al.; hot glass buildings where the blooms of youth harden into aged cacti like my penny-pinching brother.\\"(161)<br /><br />On his journey north, Cavendish raises a theme common to Mitchell's characters: \\"we cross, criscross, and recross our old tracks like figure skaters.\\" (163) His story stops suddenly (as do others), and we leap into an indeterminate post-apocalyptic future where a Korean superstate dominates a blighted planet. \\"An Orison of Sonmi-451\\" follows in Haruki Murakami or Philip K. Dick fashion an engineered fabricant's entry into sentience. Escorted out of her climate controlled confines, she confides to her listener the strangeness of a natural reality: \\"Trees, their incremental gymnastics and noisy silence, yes, and their greenness, still mesmerize me.\\" (202) In such phrasing, the beauty of Mitchell's observations freshen the familiar.<br /><br />\\"Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After\\" occupies the core around which the other stories are mirrored in two, or tucked into. Zachry's telling recalls the altered language of Russell Hoban's \\"Riddley Walker,\\" as well as the dialect and the quest of Huck Finn as one society's fragility is shattered by the arrival of tension, disruption, and unsettling values and ideas. These, filtered via Meronym from an enclave beyond the insular Valleymen, force Zachry to come of age in a brutal clash of cultures and enemies. The Valleymen are visited by Meronym, and Zachry learns why they have ventured so far across the ocean. What has happened after the demise of Nea So Corpros as the Korean hegemony is little understood; Meronym and a few Prescients guard a few factual or mythic gleanings against predators and plague that roil the globe and the miniscule remnants who've survived Earth's collapse.<br /><br />The Old 'Uns have died off, and ignorance is their legacy to the stragglers who struggle after the meltdown. \\"Smart mastered sicks, miles, seeds an' made miracles ord'nary, but it din't master one thing, nay, a hunger in the hearts o' humans, yay, a hunger for more.\\" (272) Civilization vs. savagery tears apart the survivors: it's as if delayed gratification eliminated the consumers and capitalists, the warlords and the masses unable to wait and think before rushing to buy, spend, fight, grab, grasp. \\"Old 'Uns got the Smart o' gods but the savagery o' jackals an' that's what tripped the Fall.\\" (303)<br /><br />The novel then proceeds to wrap up Zachry's chronicle and propel us back the same way we came in. Although Cavendish sniffs: \\"As an experienced editor, I disapprove of flashbacks, foreshadowings, and tricksy devices; they belong in the 1980s with M.A.'s in postmodernism and chaos theory.\\" (150) Of course, such devices long predate that decade. Mitchell applies these through such images as the moths cited earlier. It's not that difficult a novel to follow as some grousing readers and critics lamented; anyone who can read Calvino's tale can handle this. The second half, however, moves rapidly and feels often somewhat less engaging as the puzzle-pieces neatly snap together in turn.<br /><br />One device that audiences apparently needed a visual guide and a screenplay reboot for in the (unseen as yet by me) film version was the comet-shaped birthmark used by Mitchell to suggest reincarnations or rebirths of protagonists. On pg. 85, Frobisher introduces his; Luisa matches its mention to her own despite \\"I just don't believe in this crap\\" (120) and she tries to talk herself out of it as a coincidence. (122)  Zachry sees on Meronym her \\"whoahsome wyrd\\" one just below her shoulder blade in the light of Lady Moon (303); Cavendish reasons such an image \\"will have to go\\" if the Luisa Rey \\"young-hack-versus-corporate-corruption-thriller\\" will succeed on its potential. \\"Far too hippie-druggy-New Age\\"--a sentiment I've found echoed by some resenting the storyline as a novel or a film. (357)<br /><br />Given Mitchell's married to a Japanese woman and immersed via his fiction in Asian settings, there's no escaping placement of this novel into this niche via spiritual and cultural themes of rebirth. Yet, it rests there lightly--in fact, this is the one area I wanted to see much more of.<br /><br />Progress, shifts in belief and power, and earthly fate concern others. For instance, Isaac Sachs sums up the novel he's part of unwittingly. \\"One model of time: an infinite \\"matryoshka\\" doll of painted moments, each \\"shell\\" (the present) encased inside a nest of \\"shells\\" (previous presents) I call the actual past but which we perceive as the virtual future.\\" Naturally, comparison of this structure to a Buddhist (or post-modern) conception of impermanence and instability within the stories we tell and which we tell of ourselves opens this up to a neat critique of power exerted by the State and the Company, who look already as if merging today.<br /><br />Necessarily inconclusive, this novel of ideas in its last segment, a reprise of \\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing\\" deals with civilized incursions across the globe, and how power forces change and alters presents and futures. \\"Ships bring disease dust here,\\" Mr. Wagstaff observes to Ewing as they land at a Christian settlement on Rataoia in the newly named Society Islands. The natives die off, slaves are imported from other islands, and the natives decline in fertility as religious fervor does not inspire fecundity. \\"To kill what you cherish & cure,\\" Wagstaff smiles, \\"that seems to be the way of things.\\" (486)<br /><br />Countering the missionary endeavor and its social Darwinism with humanist reasoning, Adam denies any rules in history. He affirms only outcomes. \\"Vicious acts and virtuous acts\\" spur results. (507) These acts emerge from belief. To fight \\"the 'natural' order of things,\\" confidence in human qualities beyond selfishness impel idealists such as Ewing. He vows to become an Abolitionist (we glimpse this cadre in Sonmi's fearful realm), and he vows to become a force for change, even if but \\"one drop in a limitless ocean.\\" (509) With that promise, we place back the novel's last nestled doll, or its first.grasp. \\"Old 'Uns got the Smart o' gods but the savagery o' jackals an' that's what tripped the Fall.\\" (303)<br /><br />The novel then proceeds to wrap up Zachry's chronicle and propel us back the same way we came in.

0143117564|5.0|A hard-boiled detective novel? Well, in the hands of Thomas Pynchon, not quite. While it is, I believe, the most newbie-friendly Pynchon, it is filled with that Pynchon touch of the fantastic and absurd. A joy to read, full of music, movie, TV and other cultural references from the 60s. I loved it!

B005O7PXNS|5.0|I love this show!  Just started watching it a couple of months ago. Great chemistry between Beckett and Castle! yes
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing show! Can't wait to see what happens each week. Absolutely love being able to buy episodes as they are released instead of having to wait until the end of the season.
B005FDXT32|5.0|This rags to riches story of a Cuban immigrant set in 1980s Miami, Florida, is one of Director Brian De Palma's best.<br />De Palma's story cleverly depicts the ruthless and bloody World of underground drug dealers in modern-day Florida.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it ALOT!But you cant blow up TNT or summun Herobrine (a minecraft ghost). But other wise it is SOOOOOOOO COOL!(and no caves or redstone)
B003L16FAE|5.0|Bodybuilding World Champion Arnold  reunites with Bill Dukes and joins with other Hollywood heavy weights in this Sci-Fi adventure as a special forces extraction unit.  The plan was to find rebel soldiers who kidnapped Americans in the South American Jungle.  The team did not count on engaging an Alien creature that is equipped with out of this world super weaponry.<br />This was the first Predator movie that it was followed by two more sequels that were equally entertaining.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|A must read for anyone seeking to understand how human behavior and market forces combined to affect us globally.  Michael Lewis breaks down the tough bits so even those without any background in finance can see how it all unravelled....
B004RE29PO|4.0|Sigourney Weaver returns to fight the Alien creature.  She is assisted by a group of Marines who are clueless about the Alien.<br />Soon all hell breaks loose and once again it is Ripley, Weaver, who comes to the rescue to save mankind.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|We not only remember who the characters are, but now we can see them in real life action sequences. Wow!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy the game. I play with coin available rather than purchase them. It is almost addicting. It is fun.
B000EQ47GS|4.0|Just got my copy of the remastered Boston debut album, and the sound is absolutely fantastic.  Tom Scholz did a great job (again).<br /><br />Do have one issue.  The product description makes reference to live tracks recorded in the 1970's for the King Biscuit show.  None are included in the copy I received.
1575666286|5.0|Great book. I've been researching and interested in what the Gerson therapy is all about for awhile.  I fortunately, am healthy and do not suffer from any life threatening diseases. I started to come across the Gerson Therapy when I was just learning about what we eat and how our food is produced in this country. Let me tell you...it is disgusting what we put in our body. As I learned how to eat healthier I also stumbled across the power to heal our bodies and cells through what we eat. I truly believe the Gerson therapy works. I juice (not in the  extreme form of Gerson therapy) for health and notice after only two weeks better overall health, skin and body appearance. I strongly recommend the book for the recipes, prevention of diseases, educating yourself about the power of food, and if you need help with a disease you are struggling with...but you don't have to be at the point of the latter to benefit from it
B00AMBH70S|1.0|I chose this rating because there weren't enough action, fight scenes and I was disappointed with the climax. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|LOVED, LOVED the anticipation and WOW WOW the ending. Most definitely the best book I read this year.A book club highly recommended this book and I HATE HATE anything that has to do with trials, SO BORING they just go on and on, BUT THIS BOOK was so well written that I actually enjoyed the trial. It had that ending that just BLEW ME AWAY, a must read. I'm not a fan of Grisham or other Lawyer reads, but this was a great read.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Miller and Liu exude a powerful chemistry equal to Nick and Nora.<br />Sets and locations are equal to the best Woody Allen films.<br />Cinematography is most artful.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This is the cutest game and has some challenge to it as the level of roller coaster increases. The characters are really cute, good graphics. Works good on my kindle fire and the price is right. I recommend this one for everyone to play.
B008PZYZH6|4.0|Older movie, but Cussler playing with history. Cruz & Mc do a credible job. Interesting views of Mali & the Tuaregs.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have enjoyed Spider Solitare for many years now and it is nice to have it on my Fire.  I play the game almost daily.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|The movie is very entertaining and doesn't take itself too seriously like its predecessors in the franchise.  I recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of my favorite games.  It does not require a lot of planning.  It kind of plays itself.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wonderfully original story full of complex characters who are beautifully written.<br /><br />If I could give this book more stars I would. It was just that wonderful.<br /><br />Heartbreaking and uplifting, this is a story that will stick with you. The characters are real and flawed, but bear a strength and honesty that resonates. Colleen Hoover dishes it up real. This book broke my heart and melted it simultaneously.<br /><br />I'm a very fast reader, it took me all of 2 days to finish this, but that's also because I couldn't put it down. It's a page turner in every sense. I have it on my kindle app and I found myself highlighting something in every chapter so I could re-read and fall in love with the words all over again.<br /><br />Hopeless...is anything but.
0385344333|1.0|I have enjoyed Lee Child's Reacher series up to this point. I should have avoided this one based on the reviews. When I was less than half way, I pretty much rushed to the end to avoid spending any more time on it. I guess an author cannot deliver every time and given publisher pressures, he probably cannot take a break even if he is out of ideas. So lesson learned - read the reviews first ...
B000HSKUBE|5.0|This show is the best show since The Sopranos, even better. It is written for the people who like to watch challenging dialogue. This shwo engages the viewer in an intellectual way. All the actors are amazingly dedicated to give themselves to the characte, they stay on character and make the viewer beleive these are not actors, but real people in real situations. Keven is an Oscar winner!
030758836X|3.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I really hated the ending.  After all the time I spent reading it, I was disappointed.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I can't wait for the next book in this series. I thoroughly enjoyed The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear. Patrick Rothfuss is an inventive author who has imagined a compelling main character on a journey full of twists and turns.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I didn't think that season 2 was as engrossing as the previous season.  It seemed a bit redundant and boring, same old with Mr. Bates for example!  All in all the series was quite good and I am looking forward to more!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Show streamed with no issue. Only available on amazon Prime, couldn't find seasons anywhere else.  Thanks Amazon Prime for providing such a wide selection.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I didn't get anything done last week because once I started Downton Abbey I inhaled all the rest. The acting is some of the best I've ever seen. The actors ARE the characters. I care about each of them so much I found myself on the edge of my seat and even balling my eyes out at the sad parts. I have since watched Season 3 and anxiously await 4 (even though I'm extremely upset by how 3 ended.)
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Wow!  I know the Catholic Church has had some bad history but Ms. McKenna just condems the whole church.  Sorry - don't know what her problem is but her hostility is potent!
B0087DIEGE|5.0|I am very pleased with the Olympus Lens cap.  My camera came with the removable lens that was always falling off (I did not attach the string to it as some reviews say that can be annoying).  If you have this type of camera, I would highly recommend getting this lens cap.
B0019TSI8W|5.0|This movie talks to the issue of family secrets and childhood trauma and how it impacts ones life into adulthood. It keeps your attention and is very entertaining. Good movie to suggest to someone who is going through marrital questioning.
1407130366|5.0|The books came very fast, and I fell in love with the story right away.  Such a good read! Def. satisfied
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|The pact was a truly compelling story of young love. The lengths we go to for the ones we love is amazing. This book kept me hooked and wanting more from the first page
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Would buy this again - LOVE this show....wish it were On Demand, but worth the small price to pay to see it!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I have loved every single Jack Reacher book by Lee Child and Bad Luck Trouble more than most!  It's an excellent read, fast paced, and typical Jack Reacher all the way!  Do yourself a favor and read all the Reacher novels!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Another interesting topic treated in Ms. Picoult's entertaining style. Teen suicide and an incredible love make this an emotional read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game!!  Relieves the stress of the day as you try to solve each puzzle! Can't put it down!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was a great story, told from the dog's viewpoint. You'll feel connected to the characters, and don't forget the tissues!
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Geared toward the younger crowd,but we loved it anyway,lots of action,awesome monsters!!Excellent for the late teens and up to the 30  something crowd!
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|The movie itself was fine. I loved seeing Denzel play a role that represents what is true in the many circumstances today. Nobody's perfect, even when they appear to be. This was a great exploitation of just that. The sound is always suspect on the &#34;Amazon&#34; movies within my Playstation 3 hub. I can't speak for other ones but this one is bad. The music and sound effects are extremely loud, but the voices are terribly low. I hate that.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Let's face it. Almost all people want to be in a relationship. And even if it's not an intimate relationship, this book will give you another way at understanding misunderstandings. It's not just about &#34;love&#34; it's about acknowledging differences and learning to work with them, cause there's nothing you can change, but your own perception.
B003F3NDOO|5.0|I just live this show I started watching after it was canceled but then TBS picked it up and I'm glad they did! Its funny and fits my since humor perfect! Its a must watch!
B008AIGWVA|3.0|Not sure what the &#34;chemical&#34; part of the app is all about. And I wouldn't pay for more chemicals if they just do the same thing over and over (which isn't much in the first place). MY 3 year old likes it, which counts.
B008OUSFVO|5.0|I am so pleased with this album. I listen to it all the way through. She has such a beautiful voice.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I had trouble finishing the free one with three star status. When I bought the extended play, it was a lot easier than the free one. You would think it would be the other way around.
B002NPUCIA|5.0|What talent!!!!!You will not be disappointed- A+++++++++++++++++++  I felt like I was in a live concert.Every member of his band is great, too.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|I've seen this app on an IPhone and that one is a lot better than this one. I'm not sure why it would be different.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This  is a great book, but then I have not found a Nicholas Sparks book that I didn't like.<br />Like all of his books they make you cry at some point
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I found this one more challenging than the one I had to pay for (the extended play). It was much more challenging for me.
B0082SU98U|5.0|An old childhood favourite, which was well worth the read again.<br />Definitely an oldie but a goodie ... Pollyanna's glad game inspires us to keep on being positive in every situation!
B00BESKTMG|3.0|The story was a good but familiar tale. Hero wants to live in peace but is thrust into the cauldron of vengeance by bad guys who should know better.<br /><br />I enjoyed the all hooker ninja brigade, the acting, and scenery.  The over reliance on  gruesome and graphic scenes was tiresome and nauseating.
B0050PYNP8|2.0|I really looked forward to getting to see this movie for the first time.  As a huge Pegg/Frost fan, I expected the same type of intelligent humor that they have brought to so many of their other films.  Unfortunately, Paul was a huge disappointment.  That is not to say that it did not have it's funny moments, it certainly did.  The problem was is that they were few and too far between.  The ongoing \\"nods\\" to other science fiction films was also highly enjoyable.  The main problem came when the alien started talking.  Seth Rogan????  Are you freaking kidding me?  They could have picked any voice actor in the world and they picked Rogen?  Major flaw and disappointment.  Every time Paul spoke all I could see was Rogan's face and lame one-dimensional delivery of his lines (like every other movie he does). The movie would have been immensely better if they would have just picked someone else.  This was a total failure that I just could not get past.<br /><br />The real star of the movie is Jason Bateman.  He played the perfect \\"straight man\\" in this \\"could-have-been-great\\" comedy. His delivery and performance was far superior to everything else on the screen.<br /><br />Pegg and Frost did what they do best, just not as good as they have done in the past.  Going bigger and better than Shaun of the Dead will always be a challenge, but I enjoy watching Pegg try to pull it off.  It is a shame that he had to play against the failing voice work of Rogen.  Have I mentioned how bad Rogen was yet?  It is not that the lines or \\"writing\\" of the alien was bad.  I enjoyed his \\"attitude and style.\\"  Rogen's voice simply did not match the character.<br /><br />Sure the film is full of crude humor (more fitting for the 14 yr old boy crowd than anything else) but I could have seen past that had Rogen's voice not been so annoying.  The anti-American and anti-Christian themes wore out their welcome rather quickly as well.  We get it, you think Christianity is dumb.  You made your \\"artisticstatement.\\"  Understand, you are in the minority.  Get over it and move on.  You do not have to bash us over the head with it.<br /><br />As a science fiction fan and someone who would really have enjoyed this \\"trip of a lifetime\\" (even without the alien and certainly without Rogen's voice) I truly wanted to love this movie.  Heck, the movie would have been even better had they left the alien out of it and just made it a \\"nerd-buddy\\" movie.  Then again, that would have given me exactly what I wanted and would have earned this film 5 stars...yeah, no Rogen!<br /><br />Truly, I expect better from Pegg/Frost.  I hope I will get it next time.
B000059T1V|5.0|for those that don't know, that is where he got his name and you just can't beat delta blues. I was only 11 when he played this gig , thank God for recording.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|great app I turned it to creative built a mansion then turned to survaval. great app<br />just needs more updates.
B000RO9PXC|5.0|The Doors had an aura about them that caused eleveted pulse and resperations. No matter how you cook them they always serve up mindblowing.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This is like most of you city building games the twist is that warfare in mixed in. There is a lot of different types of soldier to use but the skill is all the same within the class. I do think that the samurai is way under power. If they can make different skill for all different types of soldier that will make it way better.
B00B1OWEVC|4.0|Following on from last Novembers lead in EP \\"An Omen\\"; How To Destroy Angels have now released their first full length album \\"Welcome Oblivion\\" which comes almost 3 years after their self-titled debut EP. Those who didn't bother checking out the \\"An Omen\\" EP will be surprised at the different sound the band now have adopted. There is a lot more subtly to their sound now and that includes the vocals.<br /><br />The album is mainly built up over a vast array of electronic beats, loops, drone guitars and a lot of electronic bleeps combined with whispered vocals. This is evident on the first track the mainly instrumental \\"The Wake-Up\\". People who are already familiar with Trent Reznor and long-time collaborator Atticus Ross will notice a lot of the music shares similarities with the two's score for David Finchers \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" such as on \\"We Fade Away\\" which almost features an identical droning guitar in the background as was used on the track \\"She Reminds Me Of You\\" from that movies score. The title track itself has more than an influence of former British Band Curve(who were produced by long-time Reznor collaborator Alan Moulder, who also mixed this album) all over it, including the scream and shout vocals.<br /><br />Four tracks from last years \\"An Omen\\" EP make their way onto the album including the standout near 7 minute long \\"Ice Age\\" which features a more stripped back sound which features the sound of plucked strings as Mariqueen Maandig sings over it. The brilliant \\"The Loop Closes\\" is also included and is a song that is very reminiscent of \\"Into The Void\\" off \\"The Fragile\\". The closet they get to a mainstream pop song is on the catchy \\"How Long\\".<br /><br />If you go with the vinyl option you get two extra tracks in the form of \\"The Province of Fear\\" and \\"Unintended Consequences\\", with the vinyl there is also a CD which includes the whole album as well as the two bonus tracks. The chances are if you didn't like the \\"An Omen\\" EP you won't like this album but you shouldn't write it off after one quick listen as there is plenty good stuff to be found here.
B008NEMPTO|4.0|I'm just going to talk about the digital download for this film, since that was a little tricky.  I actually had to call and talk to a live person at Fox, so hopefully this will help.  If you want to download to iTunes, the steps remind me of a computer equivalent to the multiple doors at the Get Smart headquarters from the old TV show.  First, insert the digital copy disc into your disc drive on your computer.  Second, go to your Computer program and select the DVD and right click and Open. Third, double click on DVDROM.  Fourth, double click to opent Media Manager.  Fifth, at the bottom of the list is MediaManagerII.exe.  Sixth, double click on that and it will open a box for fox digital copy.  There you will have three more steps to follow!  Sixth, enter the code from the DVD insert and then at step 2 pick iTunes for the platform.  Step 3 will give you the actual code you need to enter in iTunes, so copy and paste it into the redemption code box in the iTunes store.  Then, click your heels three times and say \\"There's no place like iTunes\\" three times.  By then, it should start downloading.<br /><br />I feel like I just completed a successful brain surgery on someone after getting this accomplished.  I'm going to copy and past this review, because the same thing is needed for Prometheus.  Thanks Fox for the telephone support or I would still be getting more grey hair on my head with this.  Have fun and enjoy the movie if you are not too tired after getting the digital download accomplished!

B001RIY49C|5.0|I thought I already reviewed this, but it is awesome.  For coming out in 2009, I was happy to get a brand new item in it's original shipping carton.  Hard to believe, but even the AAA batteries and the digital download both worked for me.  Hope you are as lucky.  I don't make it a habit of buying movie souvenirs, but this one was too cool to pass up.  I'll update if there is anything else to add later....

014241543X|2.0|It's a decent book, but not much happens. I thought there was going to be a big end where the book would make me question what would I do if I were in this position. But it didn't. It was quite a let down.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Accurate, represented the dangers well, intense, and created a poignant look at the domino effect of one nation's relationship with another and of the burden of outcome all powerful leaders bear.
0062014536|5.0|I love this book, but what's the point in pre-ordering if I still won't receive it for a few days???? I thought that was the whole reason for PRE ORDERING....
B005M61PGA|5.0|I think my subject line says it all!  I have never been disappointed in any of her recordings.  I have nothing more to say.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jumping jacks in the warm up?!? Holy moly! It is a good workout though! I have only tried it once and haven't had time to do it again because of other activities I do, but it was a good burn after just the 20 minutes of level one!
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I hadn't heard of this before but it had a lot of good actors in it so I thought I would take a chance; glad I did. Good plot, good acting, and good action. What more can you ask for !?
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|I think the previous review (K McGinn) summed up everything completely, but to add to it.......through Soilwork's tenure they've taken on different speeds, tones, styles and incorporated it into their music from album to album.  Living Infinite seems like the culmination of all of their years of work.  whether you are a long time fan or a new fan, you'll definitely relate to the album and find something to like.  but, the entire 20 songs are awesome through and through.  loving it!  get it!
B002VECM6S|4.0|A beautifully told story that seems to be true and accurate, but notice the subtle stories intertwined in the main story?<br /><br />First, there is the story about the father, owner of a multitude of fast food restaurants, who is so abundantly reaping the financial rewards of his ownership that he and his family can live a life in extremely grand style. What about his employees that are doing the work, providing the service, maintaining the properties, how are they living? How are they paid? (And yes, I know the mother seemed to be doing work for financial gain too and that also contributed to their financial success.)<br /><br />Secondly, note the harsh, negative presentation of the NAACP representative. Possibly it was accurate, but also it is good that someone was questioning what happened to this young, talented neglected boy. Too many poor children have been taken into custody to then be used as servants for their caretakers, so bravo there are representatives from the NAACP and other similar organizations that are checking things out and hopefully they aren't brow beating the children as was shown in this portrayal.<br /><br />All in all it is a movie worth seeing as long as one doesn't let their Blind Sides negatively affect you.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|First, I'm going to say that I enjoyed mockingjay. I liked the book, the ending, everything. I don't need a perfect, unrealistic ending to be happy. But what I do need? An ending.<br /><br />It just stops. Bam. Every single character is in the center of their stories and then its over.<br /><br />I waited anxiously for months for this book and I have to say I can't think of another book that was such a big let down. There's just too much story left. Either finish it or end it and write a 4th book. But it was like she had too much story and no resolutions so she just stopped writing.<br /><br />I like Lauren Oliver. I loved the first two books, and I like before I fall. But this book left me feeling deflated. I wish I hadn't read it, honestly.
B008YWY0HK|1.0|Oh my ___! It is 2013 and Disney is still promoting such stereotypical garbage in their movies! Ridiculous!<br /><br />The movie is incredibly boring. The story is the same stupid stories told in a bazillion fairy tales ~ the young, independent minded girl who knows it's insane and, ignorant to choose a husband based on his shooting skills or other physical attributes, rebels. And like too many other stupid fairy tales, she ends up cursing her family and causing great potential harm to everyone. Of course, as in so many of Disney's one dimensional story telling, the curse is broken, almost everyone is saved, etc. etc., but feed these ideas to one's innocent children, no!
B0014LX420|5.0|All of her best hits on one album!  The extras are pretty good too, some of them are a little out there for my personal taste but it's all Britney, so its all good!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Well acted and they seem to have gotten the period down perfectly. The production values were excellent.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Everyone from kids to adults are talking about the Hunger Games books.  A hot item because she is a fantastic writer.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I love this book because it taught me more about myself I never knew what my love language was &  now it makes so much sense.  I would give this book to everyone who is having a problem in there relationship or even if there not having a problem, it would help them communicate so much
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Hunger Games, is a popular amongst kids and adults both.  The author is obviously very talented in knowing what todays readers enjoy!
B009DJB9HC|5.0|For a band of rock they sound different and great. All CD'S arrived ahead of time and I will recommend.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Both my Fiancé and I really liked watching this series. The production values are very high and the acting is very strong. The only cons I would have is there are not enough episodes. The story sucks you in like a good book and it is really hard to walk away from what is going to happen next.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|If you like this kind of music don't hesitate to buy this album. I purchased all four and they are great.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Ads in this are worse as ever. They even support po*n. The gameplay was fine and fun. I mean, seriously Rovio!? Po*n with CHILDREN playing these games?! Hurting the next generation of parents...
B008Y73940|5.0|Very interesting character. Shows how conflicted people can be. People are complcated and multi demensional. A good story well made with great acting.
0553386816|5.0|Usually, I read short story collections while also reading a novel. I'm more of a novel person, so it's nice to have something to go back to in between the short stories. These stories are a bit longer (40-50 pages on average), and although there's breaks in between a few of the stories, for seven straight days, I read one story in one sitting (which takes about an hour per story).<br />I did not rate five stars because the stories are amazing or incredible. I did not rate five stars because the plots are original or especially unqiue. I rated five stars because I read for entertainment and enjoyment, and these stores are EXTREMELY entertaining and enjoyable. Each story had me glued to the pages within the first 10%, and I would read straight through until I finished each one.<br /><br />With the story Blood Drive, the book starts off with a bang. Very fast-paced, a lot of tension and suspense, and overall an excellent story. It's about three young men who set off for a certain destination, but instead get horribly sidetracked. The story turns into a heart-stopping adventure. Either my favorite or second favorite story.<br /><br />Fetching Raymond was unqiue, to me at least. It chronicles a small family, two sons and their mother, who are traveling to see their youngest brother hours before he faces death row. It's emotional because it lacks such emotion (if that makes sense). This story doesn't really have a beginning, middle, and end. It just a story, nothing else, and a pretty great one.<br /><br />Fish Files is probably more typical Grishman, dealing with a lawyer who receives an unexpected phone call and is suddenly given a chance to escape his boring, pointless life. Maybe the weakest story, but still not bad at all.<br /><br />Casino is right up there with Blood Drive as my favorite. I enjoy poker a lot, have visited Atlantic City several times, so this story really hit with me on a personal level. It's not only very entertaining, but also contains some irony, karma, and greediness. Great story, with a main character you really root for.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I don't really know what I was expecting when I bought this book. It looked a bit too chick lit for me, but it was so highly reviewed that I decided to give it a shot. Wow, I am glad that I did. A majority of the story is told through the eyes of Lou, a girl who lives a small town life until she takes a job as a caregiver of Will, a man who is wheelchair bound after an accident. I loved watching the relationship between Lou and Will evolve, and I especially enjoyed the chapters that were told from the point of view of the secondary characters. This book tackled a controversial issue that made me question what I would do in the same situation. The characters won over my heart, and by the end, I was in tears and wanting more. I am so happy that I bought this book!
B001FA0WI4|5.0|This was the second time I read Sashenka.  I loved it the first time but even more the second time around!
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|Hoffman and Phoenix certainly had Academy Award notable acting.  Each character did a superb job in defining their role ; however, the intertwining stories were sometimes difficult to fully understand.  It did make you think more about it the next day which for me usually indicates a decent movie.  For just a few bucks, it is definitely worth seeing.
B00846TTDG|5.0|Great action, real characters, good story line. If you like military movies then you're going to enjoy this one.  I watched it 4 times.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved it. I can not wait for the sequel. The story is excellent and keeps you interested from the start to the finish.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|I can not watch the series and I blame it on Amazon! I also want my money back as soon as possible!
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|Gotye's voice is a fabulous instrument, and he can do just about anything with it.  Sometimes he sounds like Peter Gabriel, other times Peter Frampton.  I love variety, but around about the third or fourth listen, I started wishing for a unifying theme.  I must admit, however, that my musical taste is very much informed by growing up in the 60's in Southern California.  I expect too much from musicians sometimes....this is a fun album with alot of catchy hooks and talented musicians.
159420411X|5.0|I ordered this, and didn't actually start reading it until I read a review elsewhere.  On a flight to Boston I managed to put away 180 pages.  A very well written, smooth flowing analysis of our ability to be misled by what we think might be real data.  This is probably one of the best books I've read in a long time (at least one I've purchased on the internet).  It's a keeper if you're into this.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|I was truly thrilled when this Anthology arrived!  I have only ever seen the Alien movies on VHS and I loved them then.....but WOW! on Blu-ray they are super fantastic!!!!  So much I had not seen before!!!  I am so glad I decided to invest in this set!
B001GXF2YY|4.0|Love the author and Bosch.  A good story.  Not his best but still a good read.  I'll read more by Connelly any time!
1400069807|4.0|*A full summary of this book is available at here: [[ASIN:B00HPC01TG An Executive Summary of Michael Moss's 'Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us']]<br /><br />You open a bag of chips intending to eat only a few handfuls. You find the chips tasting quite good, and a few handfuls turns into a few more. Just one more... o.k., last one... definitely the last one. A few minutes later you find yourself staring down at an empty bag. Then your stomach starts to hurt--then your heart. The guilt isn't far behind. Who among us hasn't experienced this at one time or another? This is junk food in a nutshell: it tastes great (practically irresistible) and is very convenient, but if you indulge too much (which sometimes seems all too easy), it's not very good for you. All of this has an easy explanation, it's right there on the label: impressive portions of salt, sugar and fat, the junk food trifecta. Each has its own appeal, and each is very inexpensive (which explains why it's in our food), but over the years each has also been implicated in some of our most common and serious conditions and diseases, including obesity, heart disease and diabetes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the junk food trifecta is not only popping up in our junk food, it is increasingly being featured in virtually all of the processed foods that we eat--from chips and soda, to canned food and prepared meals, to cake and ice-cream. And as salt, sugar and fat have become more common in the foods that we eat, the conditions and illnesses associated with their abuse have reached epidemic proportions. In his new book Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us journalist Michael Moss takes us behind the labels and explores the history and practices of the processed food industry-a story that features the rise of salt, sugar and fat, and the deterioration of our health.<br /><br />Moss divides his book into 3 parts, one for each of salt, sugar and fat (not in this order).<br /><br />In Part I, on sugar, we learn how the processed food players have used very precise science to identify just what amount of sugar they need to add to their products to hit our `bliss point' (a self-explanatory concept). We also learn how the bliss point (as well as marketing) has figured into the evolution of breakfast cereals, the soda wars, and the composition of so-called fruit drinks (such as Tang, Kool-Aid, and Capri Sun)-as well as many other processed foods. Interspersed throughout we learn about the emergence of science that has fingered sugar as a major culprit in numerous health concerns from tooth decay to obesity and diabetes.<br /><br />In Part II, on fat, We learn how this substance, unlike sugar, has no bliss point, but is instead something whose allure just seems to keep on rising the richer it is, and the more of it we find in our mouths. The focus in this section is on the history of processed cheese, and the explosion of cheese consumption since the 1970′s. This explosion, we find, has been aided and abetted in the United States by certain government policies and interventions. Indeed, while one arm of the USDA has identified cheese as being a source of deep concern for its high quantity of fat, another arm has actively promoted it through a marketing program intended to prop up the dairy industry. Processed meat is also discussed in this section, with a special focus on hamburger and bologna.<br /><br />In Part III, on salt, we learn how our taste for salt can be amplified through increased intake (and how our blood pressure tends to suffer as a result). We also learn how salt is used in the processed food industry for a plethora of purposes from enhancing certain flavors, to masking others, to adding crunchiness to products, to delaying spoilage. Finally, we learn of the ins and outs and ups and downs of the snack food sector, with its heavy reliance on salt (as well as sugar and fat).<br /><br />The journalistic expose is inherently a tension-filled genre. On theone hand, there is often an issue of real public concern at play; but on the other hand, it is ever in the interest of the journalist to inflate the controversy (and the blame). Moss does do a fairly good job of steering clear of these traps--for the most part--though the objective reader will occasionally rankle at Moss' presentation, and his choice of words and focus. On the whole, I've come away with a renewed interest and concern in just what goes into the food that I eat, and how much salt, sugar and fat it contains--and this, I think, is very valuable in itself.

0064407667|4.0|I've begun re-reading Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events with my son, who has been delighted with Snicket's morbid, gleefully odd sense of humor and his willingness to break up any moment with a little bit of anarchic chaos (usually courtesy of Sunny, whose odd outbursts have left my son laughing so hard I've had to re-read paragraphs in their wake). As for me, though, I enjoyed The Bad Beginning well enough, but it's hard to really love it knowing how much better the series gets from this point. Here, Daniel Handler (the man behind Snicket) is still feeling his way into the series, and so much of what makes the series so rich and interesting - the VFD, the intriguing moral shadings, the disguises, and especially Snicket himself - have yet to come into their own. Snicket, in particular, is far less of an authorial presence here; while he occasionally breaks the fourth wall, he's not a character to the extent that he becomes in later books. All that being said, it's still a fun book, and its love of words and reading make it a pleasure for adults who love reading to their children. Handler's a wonderful writer in general, and his plotting here is just sinister enough to keep a young boy entertaining while never being overwhelmingly dark to him; instead, he was constantly begging for just one more chapter, and kept trying to figure out the mysteries and the problems ahead of the characters. That's exactly the reaction I (and I imagine Handler) was hoping for, and it's got us leaping right into The Reptile Room from here. And soon, we'll be getting into the parts of the series that really stuck with me and made me a fan of the whole thing.

B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Okay reader, I'm going to tell you a little bit about what I thought about Les Miserables (2012), and will try to keep it shorter then the book was. Now, right off the bat I'm going to tell you that I LOVED Les Miserables, saw it twice, and that it's on my top 10 list of great films of 2012.<br />So below I'm going to first tell you the stuff that was AWESOME in Les Mis, and then I'll go through some of the negative bits, because, although amazing, Les Mis is far from perfect.<br /><br />Shall we begin?<br /><br />1. WHO DOESN'T LIKE HUGH JACKMAN?<br />Let's talk about the cast a little bit. First of all, Hugh Jackman is worthy of any and all praise you can throw his way. He plays a meaty role that almost singlehandedly carries a huge film with so much hype that even the hype was hyped, and does so with emotion and aplomb. Look for his standout moments in \\"What Have I Done\\" and \\"One Day More\\" and \\"Bring Him Home\\". His character development, especially his change from resentful convict to kind and just mayor, is handled with utmost skill, and I especially loved the evolution of his relationship with Crowe's Javert. Watching the two Aussie actors go head to head as in \\"The Confrontation\\" is riveting stuff.<br /><br />I'll talk a little about Crowe below, but I think he deserves a second mention. Say what you want about his singing (I loved it), but you can't deny he looks the part. Broad, tall, and intimidating, Javert IS. The. Law. Crowe perfectly embodies Javert's years of bottled-up vengeance, hatred, rigid adherence to rules, and unshakeable (albeit misplaced) honour.<br /><br />And I suppose Anne Hathaway deserves a LOT of mentioning. I mean, she won an Oscar - a well-deserved, hard earned Oscar! Just look at her heartbreaking rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" - in my opinion the best ever. Talk about method acting, Hathaway lost a lot of weight for her role, and had her hair shorn off onscreen. But it is completely worth it; her Fantine steals the scenes and is long in the audience's minds after she exits the film in the second quarter. If \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" doesn't move you close to tears, you have a heart of ice.<br /><br />A few notes on the supporting cast:<br />Amanda Seyfried: Didn't really work. Her portrayal came of as whiny and pampered. I mean, falling in love with a guy after seeing him for 10 seconds? Who does that? But her harmony in \\"A Heart Full of Love\\" was beautiful.<br />Eddie Redmayne: Contender for best voice in the film? Best Marius I've ever seen, and he sure beat Nic Jonas in the 25th Anniversary Musical Production! Redmayne's stunning performance of \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\" is perhaps the second best solo performance in the film, after Hathaway.<br />Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen: As Monsieur and Madame Thenardier, Bonham Carter and Cohen provide most of the comic relief. They're entertaining, I'll give them that much, but do they ever go away?<br />Aaron Tveit: When you're done throwing praise at Hugh Jackman, throw the rest to Aaron Tveit - he deserves it! His fiery young revolutionary Enjolras steals. the. SCENES. \\"The ABC Cafe - Red and Black\\" is my favourite song in the film. It's entertaining, catchy, and perfectly sung! And his death scene is one of the most poignant and rousing scenes in the film. Stellar work, Aaron!<br />Samantha Barks: And last, but by no means least, Samantha Barks was a perfect Eponine. She lived an almost absurdly sad life, but Barks (who played the character on stage before) sang beautifully, almost angelically. Her heartbreaking performance of \\"On My Own\\" is emotional and memorable. A most underrated actress!<br /><br />Extra callouts go to the little kids who played Gavroche and Cosette, and to Colm Wilkinson (The Bishop of D) - one of the first Valjeans in the musical.<br /><br />2. LES COSTUMES, LES DECORS, ET LA CINEMATOGRAPHIE<br />Sum up what Les Miserables LOOKS like in 3 words: Grey. Bleak. Dirty. Take Anne Hathaway for instance; one minuteclean and neat, the next dirty, caked in dirt, and in sore need of a bath. Take Hugh Jackman, crawling through the sewers. If your stomach didn't roil as he slogs through 5 and a half feet of sewage, you're a stronger man then me.<br /><br />And that's precisely where Les Miserables succeeds: in the costume department, in the makeup department, in the cinematography department. One critic mentioned that it took a lot of hard work to make Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway look so ugly. It takes an equal amount of hard work to make 50 extras look like 18th Century French gutter rats. It takes an equal amount of hard work to transform a concrete warehouse into the streets of Paris. It takes an equal amount of to make a film look so real, so dirty, so accurate. It takes an equal amount of work to design, sew, and age army uniforms for 50 extras.<br /><br />So lets give a big round of applause to the unsung heroes of cinema - the makeup artists, the set decorators, the costume designers, and the cinematographers!<br /><br />3. CAN YOU HEAR THE PEOPLE SING?<br />Now here's something I've wanted to do for a long time: Rank the excellent songs in Les Miserables. So here you have it: the 10 best songs in Les Miserables, according to me:<br /><br />10. The Confrontation - Javert and Valjean sing in counterpoint, and the result is fast-paced and entertaining.<br />9. What Have I Done - A heartfelt, emotional song by Hugh Jackman, with an amazing finish.<br />8. A Heart Full of Love - People, take notes. THIS is how to do a harmony, and the result is nothing short of angelic.<br />7. Javert's Suicide - I don't know what I love more about this song. The fact that Javert dies, or the fact that Crowe gives such an AMAZING performance.<br />6. Do You Hear the People Sing - A patriotic, catchy, inspiring, thundering song that make you want to sing along and shout \\"Vive la France!\\"<br />5. Who Am I? / The Trial - I never realized how damn good this song was until I saw Les Mis a second time. It starts slow and contemplative, but the ending - \\"2-4-6-0-1!\\" is positively thrilling.<br />4. Empty Chairs at Empty Tables - A sad song, sadly but beautifully sung by Eddie Redmayne. Emotional and haunting.<br />3. Red and Black - A rousing, entertaining, catchy song, sung glouriously by Redmayne, Tveit, and company.<br />2. One Day More - A brilliant, blood-stirring, rousing piece sung by almost everyone in the film. Starts slow, ends with you leaping up and cheering with your fist in the air.<br />1. I Dreamed A Dream - Could it really be anything else? Anne Hathaway gives such a raw, emotional performance; it's beautiful.<br /><br />4. CAN YOU HEAR THE AUDIENCE CRY?<br />In my opinion, Les Miserables - the book, the play, the film - is timeless.<br />Almost everyone in the audience went into Les Mis having read the book, or studied it in school, or watched a film, or seen the musical. They knew what to expect. For months before the film was even released, hype built up to an almost unimaginable level.<br />And yet the beauty and brilliance of the film is that it astounded and moved us once more.<br /><br />And it does move us. It completely and utterly justifies it's name as The Miserables. We accurately (if romantically) see the hardships and trials of living in post-Revolution France. Much of the film is bleak and grey.<br /><br />And yet in the hardship; moments of striking, startling beauty. The moon shining on Javert as he stands at the top of a tower. Candlelight shining on Cosette as she sings in her room. Hundreds of revolutionaries singing on a huge barricade in the sunshine.<br /><br />All this adds up to a very emotional, heavy experience. Many of the audience left teary-eyed. We have Tom Hooper to thank for this. He took a classic tale, and created something new, moving, and astonishing! It's brilliant.<br /><br />And now for the cons. The things that didn't work in Les Miserables:<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. I YAWNED A YAWN AS TIME WENT BY...<br />Les Miserables is undoubtedly too long. Admittedly, Les Miserables the BOOK by Victor Hugo is, when translated, the 14th longest novel in the English language; and clocks in at around the 1,500 page mark.<br />Les Miserables the MOVIE clocks in at just over 2 and a half hours.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong - I'm a fan of long movies. All my favourite movies are over the 2 1/2 hour mark and some clock in at over 4 hours (The Return of the King, Lawrence of Arabia, Seven Samurai). And compared to the book, Les Mis is like a Sparknotes summary. It's a little over 10 minutes longer then The Avengers, and it's shorter then The Hobbit; yet those two movies keep you riveted till the credits roll!<br /><br />Not Les Miserables. We drag through the doldrums of Valjean's sad sad life, then come to Fantine's sad sad life, then to Cosette's sad sad life, then Eponine's sad sad SAD life, and finally we slog through the sad sad post-climactic wedding and death scenes. It just feels so LONG!<br />The second time I watched it I leaned back in my cinema seat, rolled my eyes back in my sockets, and began to wish that someone - ANYONE - would quit singing and start talking.<br /><br />And that leads me to my next con. (Trust me, this won't go on forever.)<br /><br />2. SING TALKING...<br />Oh my god, where to begin? This is one of those things that really shook my faith in the film, like, to it's roots. I cringed, I gagged, I rolled my eyes, I groaned. It's what I call \\"Sing talking\\". The worst scenes in the film are the ones where Valjean and Javert carry out these little conversations in song. They sing their introductions, they sing their insults, they sing their questions...they sing everything, and the worst part?<br />What they sing in 3 seconds could be said in 1. What could have been short and sweet is now long and dreary.<br />And now for my last con:<br /><br />3. RUSSELL CROWE<br />Just kidding. Russell Crowe is not a con. He's awesome. Why is everyone harping on about Russell Crowe? He is the only professional singer among the main cast, the only one to win an Oscar, the only one to play Maximus Decimus Meridius.<br />Any criticism directed at him should actually be aimed at the director, because 1.They make him sing too high, and 2. They only give him two songs in which he can use his signature booming voice.<br />Amanda Seyfried on the other hand...has a really annoying soprano like a Barbie doll. I didn't like her solo performances, but her together with Eddie Redmayne and Samantha Barks = harmony heaven.<br /><br />P.S. Some (just SOME) of the camera work; held up reeaaal close and shaky, in Hooper's signature style does not fit the style or theme of the film. It does capture emotion excellently, though. I also find his overuse of Dutch angles in wide shots somewhat cheap and completely unfitting.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Les Miserables isn't perfect. It's too long, bombastic, ragged, and features some questionable singing. But you won't care at all. Les Miserables, with it's fine cast and accurate visual style, will move you, sadden you, uplift you, and entertain you.<br /><br />Les Miserables is un triomphe!<br />Vive le Tom Hooper!time.

B009T3AHDE|5.0|From the moment I heard that Robert Pattinson, he of the sparkly vampires of TWILIGHT, had been cast as the lead in David Cronenberg's adaptation of Don Delillo's COSMOPOLIS, I knew immediately that this would be a polarizing film, and judging by the critical response and the response here, it certainly lived up to that expectation. What I didn't expect, though, is that R-Patz would be so compelling in this film, and that the film itself would be more of a return to Cronenberg's earlier career before he started making more &#34;Oscar-Caliber&#34; films like A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, EASTERN PROMISES and A DANGEROUS METHOD. COSMOPOLIS is a film that reminded me of the hallucinatory semi-futurist setting of his classic VIDEODROME, in which the hybridization of humans and technology worked to create a revolution. Here, as we follow young multi-billionaire Eric Packer (Pattinson) in his ultra-high-tech limo through the streets of New York on his way across town to get a haircut, we see not a physical transformation, but rather a mental and almost spiritual transformation as his odyssey through the streets and the people lead toward a finale of inevitability.<br /><br />Packer is betting his fortune against the Chinese form of currency falling, but it's not happening yet, and he is losing millions. He also is informed by his security detail that there is a potential threat on his life. But this is all just dressing for the meat of the film, which are the several liasons with different people he has throughout the day in his limo on his trek across town. He meets with his tech guru (Jay Baruschel), a seemingly teenaged currency genius (Philip Nozuka), a sexual liason with a beautiful woman (Juliette Binoche), a daily visit from a doctor which leads to a hilarious and uncomforable scene between himself and another underling (Emily Hampshire), a discussion with a technological futurist (Samantha Morton), and more as he continually meets with his new and very wealthy bride (Sarah Gadon) to share a meal with her. All of this continues pressing on throughout a sometimes clean and shiny streetscape and a sometimes frightening hellscape as anti-capitalist protesters run amok in the streets, and it's likely that one of them could be the threat against Packer's life. More sex and shocking violence occurs as the night comes to a close, and Packer finds himself face to face with his real assassin, played by Paul Giamatti.<br /><br />What's so striking about this film is also the reason that people looking for an old-fashioned entertaining night of watching a film will be disappointed, and that is the monologues and one-on-one dialogue exchanges throughout the film, primarily taking place in Packer's limo. The film has a great deal to say about society, technology, nature, and humanity, but none of it is set or said in a particularly realistic fashion. The hyper-stylized dialogue is like honey in your ears as it constantly flows, and the performances are compelling, dark and stripped-down in a way that only an independent film can do AND make work. Pattinson is quite good as Packer, a young man who seems like he's already lived most of his life and accomplished most of his goals. Part of what is so fascinating about Packer is how lifeless he seems, even when he's living on the edge of reason. He takes what he wants when he wants it without any thought or care about the consequences. Even his own psyche is as sterile and as ordered as the interior of his limo, until he leaves it, which is when he begins to crack. Most of the other actors who populate the film are passers-by, who are not whole characters but rather reflections or representations of parts of his mind, but that doesn't diminish their presence. Standing out here, though, is Giamatti as the crazed funhouse mirror of Packer, who has focused every element of his life into killing Packer. His performance here is almost self-parody of a sort. Giamatti takes his typical sad-sack self and amplifies it to manic levels.<br /><br />It's likely that many of the people renting this film without knowing what it's about and solely for the purpose of watching Robert Pattinson in something have been and are going to be sorely disappointed with, since they won't know what they're getting themselves into, but fans of David Cronenberg and his films and Cronenberg's mission statement that has permeated almost all of his films will not find themselves disappointed with COSMOPOLIS. It's dark, disturbing, unsettling and tragic, which is pretty much the signature of Cronenberg's best work.lifies it to manic levels.<br /><br />It's likely that many of the people renting this film without knowing what it's about and solely for the purpose of watching Robert Pattinson in something have been and are going to be sorely disappointed with, since they won't know what they're getting themselves into, but fans of David Cronenberg and his films and Cronenberg's mission statement that has permeated almost all of his films will not find themselves disappointed with COSMOPOLIS.

0792844890|5.0|Classic movie,  very funny humor relating to its release date. Always great for a laugh when you are feeling blue.
B006O6EOII|5.0|my neice says that any thing related to Monster High is so COOL, and that her Nonnie is so COOL for getting those for Christmas. Thanks Amazon
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it<br />And i think it was the best book out of the entire series and all books in the world
B0049J2BSM|4.0|we like this movie not too scary for the kids, and it is a nice idea. Can't wait for the second one to come out.
B007FJFDXS|2.0|I got this as a free app of the day. The concept looks like fun, but the times I've tried it, it's been very difficult to move the cube in the desired direction. It was frustrating enough that I gave up on it after a few tries.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love Walking Dead! It's such a good show! Only tv show to genuinely scare me! Can't wait to watch more!
B008D28HYS|5.0|The puzzles included in this game range from very simple, to extremely complicated ones where the end result looks almost like a painting or photo.  Highly addictive.<br /><br />A recent upgrade added a random puzzle capability. I must say, I don't find those at all enjoyable. You solve them using the same logic as with the pictures, but the end result is, well, a random splash of colors. You can't rely on common sense to guide your choices and guesses, and there's no fun discovery of the hidden picture at th eend.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Just okay,enjoy Denzel always brings credibility to every role he plays.<br />The movie does have a good story line and moral,just slow in places
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I seldom write book reviews, only because I read a so many books. This one, and the first one, are now among my most favourite stories ever. Great characters, I love Kvothe and cannot wait for the next book! I never once found myself lost or confused, never disappointed (unless it was for the characters themselves). The story is a place I love to be, with people I'd love to meet.<br />Never gruesome for the sake of being gross, or obscene for the sake of obscenity. This is one of those series of books that I will read again and again. In fact I also got them on audio book so I can listen while I knit, cook or clean.<br /><br />If you love a good storytellers story that you can fall into and truly reside in for a while and leave happy, this is worth the time and the price.<br />(I'm a big fan of free and cheap books, so that's saying something!)<br /><br />I really don't like it when people compare it to Harry Potter! That is like comparing a happy meal to a steak dinner.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|You could see the writing on the wall almost from the first scene. However predictable it was, it still made for a nice movie with the &#34;good guys&#34; winning in the end.
0385535147|4.0|This novel had some great plot changes that I did not see coming at all. It was an easy read.
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|Pathetic attempt at movie making. We expected a well done historical novel and instead received a disjointed farce. Haven't disliked a movie as much as this for years.
0743270754|3.0|I have not started reading this book yet so not sure what to say about it. I am going to an evening with author where she will discuss this book
B003G4W49C|5.0|I did not like science fiction until this book!!  That is how good it is.  I am hooked now, and this is where the bar was set.. one of the best SF books of all time.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun!! you can get lots of people and in the update the inspector is dressed like a kangaroo!!(so cute) its really fun to play a fast pace, always moving game.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game except that lately it locks up and I have lost a lot of games because it won't let me play towards the end of a game. Don't spend any money on it until they fix the glitches. just use the free credits they give each day.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great love story in the beautifully based setting of North Carolina! Sparks draws you in from the first page and, while having a great ending, leaves you wanting more!
B003Y5D776|5.0|I know apple wants to save space on their laptops, but not adding a mic and separate earphone port is ridiculous.  I like the option to be able to switch between line-in and line-out.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like it it has good graphics and it is fun to make the horses do what you want them to do. I think it is pretty cool but it takes a long time to load.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Do not miss this show.  Watch now before you get too far behind.  I heard that Season 2 was amazing.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|I was anxious to get another Ken Follett book at such a good price and used my gift card from Christmas  So a real win-win for me!

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works great, is simple to use and does everything I need it to. The price is right as well. Two thumbs up,  nicely done.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|If you love Robert Downey Jr. (because let's face it, he's awesome) and you like a whip smart Val Kilmer with great comedic timing, just go ahead and buy this movie. Wasn't sure what I was anticipating when I watched this, but it was great! The way they started the story, how they cut it and the insanely funny lines and moments in the movie.....almost remind me of Guy Ritchie and his unique way of filming. It's a little strange, but in a good way. Go ahead, buy it. It's great!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Wow  this is no stop no sleep read  keeps you riveted as long at it goes on on.  A true thriller
B0061QD7ZM|4.0|Great story, great cartoon. Was raised on Disney movies like this. Classic tale and worth introducing your little ones to, or even watching by yourself to get into the cute story.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander took me on a journey of seeing the light and back.  So happy that he shared this inspirational story to prove that there is a Heaven!  I already know that and confirmation is always welcome!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Seriously, one of my favorite Disney stories ever. Watched it as a kid and still watch it now in my mid twenties!
B0057AOS3I|5.0|one of the few albums where I love all the songs!. I had to download the MP3 after I lost the CD. I bought the CD when it first came out.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|Strange sentence I know, but I really do enjoy this movie, even though it's a little corny. This is Whitney Houston in her first movie role where she's a singer who, you guess it, needs a bodyguard. There have been attacks on her life/creepy circumstances that keep happening to put her and her family in harm. Enter Kevin Costner ex-Secret Service to add a little fire and action. She overacts a little bit, but not large enough to be off putting. And let's face it, Kevin Costner is just awesome. A little cheesy, but worth the buy. For nothing else, to just stare at Kevin Costner in action or just to hear the ethereal voice that belonged to Miss Houston.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Love this show.  Have watched NCIS since the beginning and hope to watch it for years to come.  One of the best crime dramas on TV.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|Great movie, great songs and great story for the kiddos to watch and as an adult you won't have too much trouble watching it more than once. (as mostly happens with little ones.)
B009JZTOG8|5.0|It's rare to see a fantasy tv show with interesting plots, well developed characters, and suitable for both young people and older adults.
B00007AJGH|5.0|Oh my gosh, thought it was awesome as a kid and still think it's awesome now! Really different but still good! Bob Haskins is in it! Need I say more?
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It makes navigating folders and files so much easier on Kindle Fire HD.  One of my best and most-used programs.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Seriously, there is nothing bad with this movie. It had a love story, some action and, even with a cartoon, was able to have some very heart-rending scenes. The kids will love it and the adults will not be able to stop watching it. When this movie is over, you'll have laughed, cried and find some great lines to quote. Shows you that, no matter how old you are, you can always go on an adventure.
B004OZZ624|3.0|Nearly didn't make it through the first hour, then it finally picked up a bit.  On the fence regarding recommending it.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Seriously, this is a classic in my household. Love this version (not the new one). Watch it every year at Christmas and it still touches my heart.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|My wife read this in one night so I figured it was good  I was not disappointed. I am a pretty slow reader and I read it in a week. I felt that the the characters were very interesting. They were easy to read about and the story read a little like a mystery.
B000P0J0AG|5.0|Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd and Hank Azaria.....Need I say more? I could seriously go on and on. Pop this in your Dvd player and it's almost like a game of spot great actors. Great bank robbery/convicts verses police chase type movie. If you're a fan of Reservoir Dogs, The Untouchables, Donnie Brasco, etc. check this out. Only complaint is this is a loooong movie. I think it's almost 3 hours. So make sure to have a lot of popcorn to eat and to throw at the screen. :)
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|Great story. Very original. Incredible animation and visual effects. Top-notch voice acting. Our 3 year-old, 6-year-old, my wife and I all loved it. We rarely have that much agreement on a film.
B0007KTBIU|4.0|Great story, great songs and a few great actors voicing some of the characters. Grew up on this movie, good one to let the little ones watch.
B0094K35S6|5.0|I've watched this movie 8 times already. Every aspect of it is fantastic. The dialog, acting are top-notch. The VFX are mind-blowing. And the story is second to none.
B00002SSKI|5.0|Grew up on this movie. It's a classic in my household along the likes of the Goonies, Sandlot and Stand by Me. Normal kids experiencing grown up things. Great tale, worth the buy.
B00631VJIC|4.0|The music for SOA is as much a part of the show as Gemma, Clay, Jax or any of the crew and I love that Katey Sagal sings on the album with Bird On A Wire and Strange Fruit. The music is a wonderful collection and a must for any SOA fan.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Great movie, great songs and great story for the kiddos to watch and as an adult you won't have too much trouble watching it more than once. (as mostly happens with little ones.)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best dramas ever.  The show has great plot lines and intrigue.  There is great character development and writing in every episode.  The humor from the grandmother, Maggie Smith, is great.  She shows you why she has an Oscar.  A definite must watch for any one that enjoys a novel-like story.
B002XTXG1G|5.0|This movie is strange, yet intriguing and slightly off kilter but I loved it! Go ahead and buy it, but be warned! It's for adults only! There are a few parts that are for mature eyes only!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is funny cause it express details and comedy so I read all of the books best book I read yet
014312093X|2.0|Well, to tell you the truth the movie did stay in line with the book, but it had a completely different tone. Book was super slow and was unable to finish it.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|the sweeper does a fine job on hard floors.  we are using it mostly on  our outdoor carpeting, and does fine with small leaves.and twigs,  the emptying is not smooth...maybe a release lever could be installed .
B003L20ICE|3.0|I know this film was nominated for a few Oscars but it was a little slow. It's really good as a whole, but have to push through a few slow parts.
B000SFD21Q|5.0|Just what I was looking for to inspire me to get out there and exercise. It is not the spare tire around my middle, it is the one around my brain that needs trimming.
6304806434|5.0|Classic movie with great actors, even greater action and let's face it......Nicholas Cage with long hair. :) Certain aspects of the story are a little far fetched, but still a great movie. Everytime i watch it brings me back to the time where movies were awesome and action packed had (somewhat) original stories. Even Nick Cage's accent can't ruin this movie. (but almost-haha) Worth the buy to watch at least once in your life.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Awesome!!!!  Beautiful actors and great story.<br /><br />It's a fabulous combination of myths and modern times, it makes you wish for Thursdays.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Can't say enough about this movie! Grew up on it as a child and am going to introduce it to my children. Great classic story with songs that I always end up singing with at the end.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Love Ollie but not sure if I totally understand where he is going.  The episodes range in depth and emotion but can't really put my heart and soul into Ollie's cause.<br /><br />Good story line and very surprising flashbacks!!!
B001TM14VC|4.0|The video quality is adequate but not outstanding. I have seen many movies older than this that appear better on my Tv.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This has given myself and granddaughter hours of entertainment. She is nine. Easy directions to follow and at time challenges for us both. A must have for those long waits at airports, hospitals, and Grandma`s shopping sprees.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love pinning on Pinterest!  This app was very easy to download and functions perfectly.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I've been watching horror movies since Rosemary's Baby came. Not one of them have been the least bit scary, but this movie scarred the hell out of me. I'm still dreaming about it. The best horror movie I've seen in twenty years. I've been looking for a true horror movie for years, and I think I've found it in this movie. Thank You.
1593272839|5.0|I always liked Haskell and wanted to learn it. I tried Real World Haskell but while I enjoyed the language a lot the book frustrated me with its organization and unwanted deviation from the main point of introducing the language.<br /><br />This book is such a joy though. I actually decided to buy it after reading most of it online from the author's website. I don't find his narratives particularly funny but his introduction of the language was concise and extremely easy to understand. Most importantly, the book is full of useful pointers and has a minimal amount of jargon that put me to sleep. I think the fact that he was a student when writing the book must have helped.<br /><br />The book doesn't have any exercise but I never am one to bother doing those. Still, I find myself testing things out and going back to earlier chapters where I can easily find the relevant information because they are so concise and straight to the point.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1848566190|5.0|If you love great movies, movie posters, or are just appreciate great art, this is an amazing book to own.  It goes beyond being a collection of poster reproductions to give you a look at the comps Struzan creates for each one accompanied by commentary by the artist himself on his process.  Covering only 40 posters that span almost three decades just as many years you might think this book is too brief but if you love the art you'll at least a few hours pouring over the sketches and admiring Struzan's skill.<br /><br />The forward by Frank Darabont strikes a defiant and certainly angry tone on the outset.  He praises Struzan's work as much as admonishes studios and the marketing people for not doing so.  Darabont's sentiments are echoed, though gentler in tone, by Struzan himself leaving the reader annoyed by the choices made by marketing execs as well as sad that art as movie advertizing is dying, if not dead already.  With this book running right up to his retirement, you can see the heartbreak on the page as poster after poster is not picked up for use and the director's commissioning it are left making short run prints or simply holding onto it.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a beautiful collection and a wonderful glimpse inside the studio and the process of these creations.  Each full page finished image is so nicely printed they could be framed themselves, but that of course would destroy the book.  My only suggestion for the reader is to have your computer ready and be prepared to hop online and check out what the finished art work looks like. In some cases it's interesting to check the final placement of the title and credits, in others it's worth checking what the studio did instead of using this art.
0525478817|5.0|Astounding, brilliant, true to life. This fascinating journey of teenagers in love sounds sappy as an overall theme, but this tale is one featuring the most captivating teens I've ever met on the page--and certainly in real life. Magnificent dialogue, amusing at times, often wrenching, every word original. This is one not to miss. Touted as a Young Adult novel, but everyone truly NEEDS to read this book. I keep thinking about these characters, over a week since I flipped to the last page.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I saw all the reviews and thought I would give it a shot. So glad that I did. It started out slow for me but wow....what a story! Loved it!
B000OW77UU|5.0|I love this movie. It is a inspiring movie that after you finish watching, It has a powerful force to get you believing, everything is possible. My favorite line is: &#34;If you ask me something and I don't know the answer, I will tell you I don't know BUT I will find the answer&#34;

B004R1Q296|5.0|A Distant Mirror / 9780307793690<br /><br />I selected this book for a book club discussion, not realizing that it's ~700 pages long rather than ~400 pages long. Whoops! However, this is a completely awesome book and everyone had a ball reading and discussing it, even if several members weren't able to finish on time, and I recommend it highly as a fun and fascinating, as well as wonderfully researched and sourced, look into 14th century culture.<br /><br />\\"A Distant Mirror\\" is a look at the 14th century and follows the life of Enguerrand de Coucy VII as a vehicle for examining every facet of life during this time period. If the idea of following the life and biography of a 14th century French lord you've probably never heard of turns you off to the idea of this book (as it briefly did me when selecting this book to read), don't let it! Tuchman is an absolute master at her work, and manages to make Enguerrand VII's life deeply interesting and entertaining, while using the larger narrative to talk about every aspect of 14th century life in griping detail.<br /><br />Indeed, the first 8 chapters (of 27 total) deal largely with 14th century life before even really introducing Enguerrand VII, and while the entire book is 100% concentrated awesome, these opening chapters are definitely my favorite. Tuchman examines the 14th century ideals of religion and chivalry (as well as when and how and why the ideal diverged from reality), the social and political climate of the 14th century for France and some of her surrounding neighbors, the daily lives of both nobles and commoners (including their entertainments, their religious observances, and their access to medicine), and the impact of the Black Death and the Papal Schism in shaping history and social thought.<br /><br />Tuchman is a truly entertaining writer, and I love how she shows her work as she goes along, and grounds sources before using them by warning the reader as to how accurate and/or unbiased the source is understood to be. (One terribly amusing anecdote of a brigand company shaking down the Pope for money is prefaced with the note that \\"it has been said of Cuvelier that 'the tyranny of rhyme left him little leisure for accuracy.'\\") And while this is absolutely a history book, it reads just as fluidly and fascinatingly as you could ever hope for -- I finished all ~700 pages and was left with nothing but admiration for this book and the feeling that Tuchman had made a really large and complex subject very accessible to the lay-person.<br /><br />A note on the audiobook version of this book: There are currently two different versions of this book available on Audible, one narrated by Nadia May and one narrated by Aviva Skell. I tried listening to both books, and I recommend the Nadia May version. Her narration is a little slower than Aviva Skell's (indeed, there is a 2.5 hour difference between the two versions, and I think that's entirely pacing and not reflective of new/added material between the versions), and I found the pauses and slower pace necessary in order to adequately process all the material in this book. And Nadia May's pronunciations of the French names and places in this book are delightful to hear, so there's no need to worry that you might not be getting the full experience with her.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this book if you have any interest in the 14th century or in chivalry and its effect on nations when large sections of a privileged populace are armed and dangerous.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollerstood to be.

And Nadia May's pronunciations of the French names and places in this book are delightful to hear, so there's no need to worry that you might not be getting the full experience with her.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this book if you have any interest in the 14th century or in chivalry and its effect on nations when large sections of a privileged populace are armed and dangerous.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll
B000LB7G00|5.0|Use it for sketchup modeling, saves, a ton of time modeling.  Much easier on the wrist too.  I likely click 90 percent less now.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's so enjoyable that it's almost addictive.  I highly recommend it.  Nine more words required.  Oops.  I can't add.  One more . . .
B0086221SS|1.0|This movie was slow and over-interpreted by the director. The acting was good, but it is the story that lacked any real real depth. You can tell the director was looking for you to have some kind of \\"aha\\" moment like so many other independent films do successfully in a less-than-Hollywood way. Unfortunately, I was left saying, \\"uhhh\\".
B0091W7K6K|5.0|Great movie. They dont make them like this anymore. The cinematography was excellent so was the music and the acting.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|Muse fans who want the same sound over and over will not be pleased with &#34;The 2nd Law.&#34;  But those of us who enjoy growth in a band have plenty to cheer about.  Electronic and Pop/Dance sounds fill a good percentage of the album, but some moodier gems can be found throughout.  The radio friendly &#34;Madness&#34; is incredible!  That alone is proof that the band is reaching out in many different directions.  It is not, as some Muse fans stipulate, a &#34;sellout&#34; for dollars.  The song is just downright groovy and has a perfect beat and rise and fall crescendo that can't help but put you in a good mood.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is such a fun game with lots of realistic movements and fun little tasks to complete. Any horse person would like this game!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|up top its a good game but I'm pretty mad at timelimit it Suks so don't build anything big kkkkkkkkk
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great show, captured my imagination/attention!  Characters are likeable/believable and weekly storylines are intriguing.  My husband and I are both hooked!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|For every piece of interest of the book it's ruined by a long unneeded sex scene... I wish there was more than just sex could've been an awesome book.
B004X4QW42|5.0|If you enjoy classic and well done martial arts, IP Man 2 is definitely a must see movie. Donnie Yen is perfect in his role as Yip Kai-man, the grandmaster who trained Bruce Lee. This film is loosely based on his life. Not only are there great fight scenes, but the story line is compelling as well. I do recommend you watch the original IP Man, with Donnie Yen, before watching this sequel.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The movies and their cuality are awesome, also the additional features!<br />100% recommended, definetly a must have for every fan of Batman!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read it only because soooo many people were talking about it. My aunt loved it, my mom was too embarrassed to continue reading it- I didn't even think it was as kinky or salacious as some made it out to be... I definitely didn't expect to be teary eyed!!! Great beginning to the trilogy!!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game i think that its better than temple run.There are lots of characters you can get too.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great, easy to navigate app. Beautiful in it's design!! I have this app on both my Kindle and my phone. Great!!
B00AFROVQC|1.0|[[ASIN:1939416019 A Quest of Heroes (Book #1 in the Sorcerer's Ring)]]<br /><br />This book is, in truth, as if written by a child. It is full of grammatical/spelling errors. The plot (?) is thin at best. At no time do I find myself rooting for any \\"heroes\\"! Sad to say it is compared to Rowling or Tolkien! An insult! I am nearly through this book, and only keep reading to see if it improves. Not looking promising. Save your time and your money. Anyone who is really a fantasy fan will say the same.<br /><br />If a novel doesn't grab you in the first two chapters, it probably won't. I almost feel sorry for the characters in this one, they might stand a fighting chance of being substantial in the right hands. Possibly the \\"epic\\" improves with the next volumes? I won't be finding out.
B008M721MS|4.0|This is a gift for my daughter, looking forward to her enjoying!  She will read, play games and learn a lot! So far so good!!
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Memphis is the first album/CD we've had from Scaggs in quite some time. This doesn't mean he hasn't been active on the music scene, however, as he was recently touring with Michael McDonald and Donald Fagan. I caught one of those shows and Boz was on his game the entire time; just as he was the eight other times I saw him perform live.<br /><br />If what you think of when you hear the name, Boz Scaggs is `Lowdown,' `Lido Shuffle,' and `We're All Alone,' then you've really been missing out on what Scaggs has been putting out since then. This is especially true of late, such that his newer songs don't sound like those at all. Thus, if you're looking to pick up where you left off with Silk Degrees by purchasing Memphis, you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you've followed Scaggs' career through the years, you will find that this album brings us full circle--albeit with a more mature and solid voice--back to how he was performing in the pre-Silk Degrees days. Here, we have flavors of `Moments,' `My Time,' and `Boz and Band.' You will also hear a lot more `Come on Home' sounds than those of `Silk Degrees' or the albums that immediately followed. This is especially true with the song `So Good to be Here,' a number previously recorded by Al Green.<br /><br />In a variety of ways, the spirit of Al Green (yes, I know he's still alive) influences this whole album. I believe it was even recorded in a studio used by Green years ago. This influence and relationship is a long one, as both Boz and Al recorded `Old Time Lovin' long before `Silk Degrees' hit the market. In fact, while you're buying this CD, make sure you download Scaggs' version of that song (oh, ok, get Green's too).<br /><br />This current album has 12 tracks, only a few of which were familiar to me. Scaggs offers a mellow, smooth rendition of `Corrina, Corrina'--in contrast to how it was performed by Dylan, BB King, and others. His version of `Rainy Night in Georgia' is ok, but it's been recorded by so many people, I wish he would have found something else to slip into that slot. Just hearing Scaggs sing `Love on a Two Way Street' is worth the purchase of the CD.<br /><br />Consistent with some of the sounds from the `Coming Home' album--or more recently, what we heard from Scaggs on the Chris Gaffney Tribute CD--this album fits into the `smooth, mellow  jazz' classification. In many ways, however, it's really hard to classify, as you will hear blues, R&B,  jazz, and Boz--a unique combination that defies description. `Mixed Up/Shook up Girl' and `Cadillac Walk' are two of the peppier songs on this album, but if you're looking for spice, don't expect `What Can I Say' or `Breakdown Dead Ahead.'<br /><br />Overall, it's great to have something new from Boz to listen to. I don't foresee these songs dominating the airwaves the way some of his earlier work did, but it's still a great album, with good flow, clean sound, and Scaggs' voice throughout. It's a nice CD to listen to while driving or to have in the background while at home. I can't imagine that anyone will be disappointed with the purchase of this CD and it's one you'll likely play on a regular basis.rded by so many people, I wish he would have found something else to slip into that slot.

B00008CLOA|4.0|I heard Money at a CES show in Vegas years ago and wanted this album in Surround Sound format. First off today alot of DVD & Blu-Ray players can play them!! Now I don't have my dream A/V receiver yet I do have a Onyko small Digital surround processor than has both DD & DTS and it sounds great!!!
B00932AA5G|5.0|A surprise masterpiece! Much in the style of Tarantino and Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. Surprising violence wrapped around intelligent humor. A wonderfully fun film.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|Just like Bond, something to add to my collection on Bond Movies and toys, cars, weapon, attache case, just love it.
B005LAII80|5.0|As a 3D BluRay movie I'd have to give this 5 stars... watched it a couple times in a row.  What more can I say
B008VBYN80|5.0|I thought I'd try this. It was a little slow to begin but better as I went. Check it out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i think that it was really good, the only thing i didn't like was the character models, they look kind of creepy.
B0031RSA24|4.0|I found the perspective very interesting and the arguments compelling. Especially interesting it the perspective of evidence versus the constant argument of feeling on the contrary. I think that for any individual in search of the meaning of life a read of this book is absolutely required.
B0062OCNAI|2.0|Good plot, good characters but gee whiz, heavy on the schmaltz and sentiment. Less is more! Saw the end coming less than halfway through and it didn't have to be that way.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can not get enough of Downton Abbey so much so that I spent the money to buy the second season on my Kindle Fire. The second season is just as good as the first delving into more of the storyline of the upstairs and downstairs characters. This is a must buy if you are a fan of the series.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really like the story and the graphics. I would be wasting more time if this app were free. I might buy it if I get to level up
B00701QV0A|5.0|Absolutely wonderful, just as good now as it was years ago, when it first came out.  This was a gift for my husband, who &#34;introduced&#34; me to the Alan Parsons Project when we first got together.  We both love them!  And we thoroughly enjoyed<br />listening to this CD (several times).
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like it. It is easy to move from page to page and to operate.  I just hope this update goes well.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This was written like Mr. Flynn of the old days.  Excellent book with the continuation of Mitch Rapp and the rest of the characters we know so well plus some new ones just to keep us on our guard and thrown off balance!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Really good app for exploring your device. Works fine with my kindle fire and allows me to easily access my files. Makes me able to find my files without using computer and really hepatitis for downloads
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I can't stop thinking about this book. It was not an easy read, or a quick one, but it was unlike any book that I've ever read. The format is very unique, with the first half of six different stories told in the first half of the book, and the endings of each story told in reverse order for the second half of the book. Each one has a different format (journal entry, letters, Q&A, etc.) and was written for a different time period.<br /><br />When I finished Sonmi's story, I was rather shaken and amazed by its impact on the future world. The rest of the book was somewhat anti-climactic, but it's interesting to think back on all the connections and implications the rest of the chapters had on the book as a whole.<br /><br />I'm interested to see how this book was made into a movie (the trailer gave me chills after I read the book) and I look forward to discussing this at book club!
B008KE3960|5.0|Very nice game. A new twist on standard tower defends. Does a great Jo. And is fun. Just takes a bit off time to earn the in game currency. But still very fun.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, and it was especially good as an audiobook. It was a good mystery with decent characters. Some of the murder situations were a bit too violent for my taste and some of the situations and conclusions were a bit far-fetched. Overall, though, I liked the book and look forward to reading more about Jack Reacher's adventures.
B008M87GJK|5.0|This news program has a wide variety of news I like to read about. Updated regularly and quickly. Best new source I have found. Great app.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|The Brits know how to relate historical topics with great attention to detail and great actors , Masterful background scenes
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game has a lot of new things over its previous one. Hard at first but gets easier as you learn how to use the new towers and figure out the wave system. One of the top games and is great on the kindle fire. Gets slow in the 80s or 90s.
B0060MYM3S|3.0|I found the total details of the book missing and frustrating . They could have included more of Martin's details even if it was longer to film . Probably won't buy Season three --have to think about it .  The novels he writes are far superior . I would say read the books (ALL 7 LENGTHY) BEFORE WATCHING THE DVD or you get lost a lot---------
0316044695|5.0|I HIGHLY recommend reading this book! Marcus Luttrell's story is remarkable and the heroes he served with are true patriots and will never be forgotten.
B008CLI4N4|3.0|Not as I imagined the characters to look like and a lot of the story line left out . But it is well acted and better than most stuff you see at the movies and on TV . Glad I have read all 6 volumes and am waiting to order the Winds of Winter seventh novel , hoping it will be the final chapter!
B004DM0UII|1.0|Honestly, I read about it thought it would be something I would use but I guess it just too backwards when you are already on pandora
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I love every song!  They have a very unique sound and I can't wait to hear more from them in the future.
B004Y042N8|1.0|GlowPuzzle is a boring app, wish I didn't waste my time downloading the app. Didn't really understand how it's suppose to be entertaining
0792160347|5.0|Worth the money, Love his work. Worth watching time & time again. Happy with purchase. He can Gigolo me anytime.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|Unfortunately my TV was not compatible if iMediaShare but if it was I think this would be my favorite app
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The graphics are decent and the tiles are easy enough to see on my RAZR M.  Sometimes its hard to tell which tiles are accessible, and you have to hunt.  lots of interesting setups and some of them are challenging.  Glad the game resets itself when there are no more moves.
B007BFSYMS|1.0|I never used white noise because it sounded too much like I was inside a machine. I prefer nature noises
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I think that he is the greatest actor alive today! If he were a Caucasian...he would have more Oscars then he knew to do with! But...that's another subject!!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Wish you didn't. Have to wait 23 hrs to power up. And don't like how it chooses your powerups for you. And 500 coins for three lousy powerups is pretty stupid when you cannot choose them.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I purchased this for one of my granddaughters, and it looks so nice in her bedroom.  She and her father put these on the wall, and it makes such a nice difference in her Princess Room
B0063IH60K|5.0|I didn't think I could get interested in solitary AFTER a decade of not playing it,but, here I am always needing another session. Great app.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|All John Grisham readers should really enjoy this book. I love it on my Kindle, but I love this author so much, he really lives up to the the part of writing so many page turners, and this is just one more great one! Thanks
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Each episode is a joy.  There are times that I have to watch the next episode, even it is midnight.
B008KW43TE|4.0|Frank Ocean has it all! I must say he surprised me with his smooth type jams. If you enjoy R/B or rap you'll definitely enjoy him. He reminds me of Common and has the lyrics too.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|This album holds up to the standard set by all his previous albums... excellent work. Well worth your time and money.
B000A6EXNO|4.0|If you want to get the Magnifying Eyepiece Nikon DK-17M, you MUST get this. I wear specs so this prevents my specs from scratches and damage.
B006885EFE|5.0|This series is an incredible and faithful adaption of Stephen Ambrose's original book about Easy Company. Brilliantly acted, and lacking the ridiculous flair of Hollywood action films. It captures the gritty reality of the soldiers of te front line, instead of the generals and their maneuvers. This is a must watch for anyone interested in WWII.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I seriously love all the seasons of Smallville. I love the unexpected twists and the secondary characters, Especially the introduction of Chloe Sullivan and Lionel Luthor.
B009O2XY12|4.0|Great game but freeze up stop working when i got to level 13 had to whait a while for my tablet to start working again
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Great movie!  Clint is always Clint...a real hard case and Amy Adams plays well off of him.  Worth a watch!
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|When I tried to play the game it didn't respond to my password and I wrote my password down to make sure and it didn't let me play I wish l could be playing right now =(
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I think this app would be very helpful.  It  can do math plus percentages..  l think it would also be helpful when checking my budget for the month...
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was so not what I expected it to be. I was waiting for the typical teenager romance with the good girl and the bad boy. But it became so much more. There was mystery and excitement as well. I love when a book has an unexpected twist that pleases the reader.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|best tv series, more violence, more drama :)<br /><br />you start to like a character and suddenly he dies. This is cool :P
B001NLL93W|3.0|This is a true YA read. The younger crowd will like it. I dont know any adults that typically like YA that have fallen for this one. Good plot and story. Seems a bit Harry Potter ish to me without the awesome created world from those books.
1616550414|5.0|Is a great book that any fan of the serie must have, is very complete plus have a excellent quality
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|so many people just love this. I didn't. I had to make myself finish it. The characters and their issues drove me crazy. I justdont get why so many people love it. I thought it was just ok.
1557048630|5.0|This is a fantastic book.<br />The book has hundreds of illustrations and many storyboards.<br />This Art of book does not disappoint! Great gift!
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I personally dont seem to love these books as much as everybody else. It could be better-maybe thats why i rate it ok. But I have read the others. The created world is good and the characters are interesting.
0811875555|5.0|This is a fantastic book.<br />The book has hundreds of illustrations and many storyboards.<br />This Art of book does not disappoint! Great gift!
B001NLKZUA|3.0|I am an adult but I really like a lot of YA reading. I think this one will be more liked by a true YA, like my daughter. There is that creepy incest issue lurking around but somehow you just know that it is not really true so it doesn't bother me that much.
1452101426|5.0|This is a fantastic book.<br />The book has hundreds of illustrations and many storyboards.<br />This Art of book does not disappoint! Great gift!
B002PTNY7A|4.0|If you haven't seen this one you might want to watch it.  It is a good film and although it drags at times it really carries a good story line.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I have been in love with this story since high school,I have seen every movie made on it, I was always so sad when they ended.I wanted the story to go on forever. Having never read the book I decided to do so and I'm so pleased I did its was everything I hope for and more. A MUST READ FOR HOPELESS ROMANTICS LIKE MYSELF !!!!!!
B003VS0CWO|5.0|I love this movie.  I own it on VHS, Laser Disc, DVD and Now BLUE-RAY.  Wonderful copy.  Crisp picture.  Stunning Sound.  All Around great disc.
1439170916|5.0|I found this book to be most enlightening. It's a very sobering thought to know how many will get cancer in their lifetime. It surely seems we would be doing more in the area of prevention.
B0009UC810|4.0|This little Flick is a classic and the aniversery edition is just a little cut above the mark.  A must for serious collectors.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|It's the greatest story of good conquering over evil. A little bit of the princess in each of us and a little more of the b**** people don't want to see. A little of the romance we all want and a crystal ball to the story we knew growing up. I love this show and I never miss an episode. Had to buy it immediately because its so well .....u think of a word that means awesome ans there you have it.
B003QTNFHW|3.0|Not a bad flick but the original was just better.  There was a magic missing in all of the special effects of the remake.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|While I can appreciate its uniqueness and its attempt at something more unexpected than your average run of the mill detective who-done-it, aside from a solid performance by Tommy Lee Jones this film unfortunately doesn't have much to offer. The characters and plot are random and disjointed, and the conclusion is far from a shocking twist. If you're looking for something different and have a few hours to kill, give it a shot and perhaps you'll appreciate it. Otherwise if you're expecting a nail-biting suspenseful murder mystery, look elsewhere.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked that he added a thriller twist to this book.  I hope to see him write more books like this.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Love the variety. Awesome deal for $1.99. Wished for more than ten songs. Speedy download. So happy I got this.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, although friends I was watching with were disappointed as they did not realize it was about alcoholism.  I thought Denzel Washington did a great job 'being'the character.  Only four stars because I was left feeling like I didn't fully understand what conditions in his life had led him to the low point he was at, or even why he was such an accomplished pilot.  I guess I would have liked more background development.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Love this album so much. They have such a unique sound. So glad it was the $5 download of the week!
B005DOKM9M|5.0|The sleeve is easy to use, very functional, protects the Kindle extremely well, and keeps it safe and dust free.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I'm a Jennifer Lawrence fan so when I knew the character was her, I couldn't wait to read it. After having done so, I'm glad I was drawn to this book. It's a great read regardless of who plays in the movie.  I would recommend it to those who root for the underdog and sometimes mentally ill.
B0076DELIG|4.0|All one really needs to know about this book by Michael Connelly is that it is about Harry Bosch when both are in top form.  The plot is convoluted but Harry methodically works through the puzzle and even manages to drag one of the Gulf Wars into it.  This is a good read but pay attention or you'll find yourself lost and the murder unsolved.
B00ATUEKY8|4.0|I'm glad I did.  American Lit: had to read it in high school, want to read it as an adult.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|You will not be able to put this book down. You just want to know more and more how it will work out. Nicolas Sparks created very believable characters and creates an amazing story out of their lives. Beautiful twist at the end! The book is soo much better than the movie. I just wish Hollywood had just done the book instead of trying to improve on a great story and amazing characters.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|You know that book you hate to read fast because you don't want it to end, but you can't put it down because it's so good?<br />This is it!
B004SDEP38|4.0|I'm most interested in being able to open attachments on my Kindle, whether it's office docs sent via email or PDF's posted on a web site. I've tried free app's before and have not been able to even find the containing folder, let alone actually work with the attachment. Documents To Go looks and navigates like a desktop office app and works on file formats from Microsoft, Open Office, Adobe -- what more do we need?
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Awesome game probably one of the best ones I have on my kindle I absolutely love it totally worth getting it just takes forever
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|this is a great movie. i fan of Ms Kate and underworld. i bought all 4 movie. why must the comment be so long.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|This was in excellent condition and brought back so many memories. This is a classic that will never get old.
B004G600A4|5.0|U will love it. it a great movie with plot and drawing. u cant miss it. 4 more word of comment?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was pretty good and reaally great graphics, expensive power ups though other then a fun game good for wasting time
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore & Ryan Lewis have talent, and they actually rap about things that matter in today's society.  I love &#34;Same Love&#34; and have adopted it as my theme song. &#60;3
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Might not be the true facts, but a great movie!  In fact, the best movie I've seen this year.  I plan on watching several times.  Well written and executed.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|it is supperbly fun. the twisting and getting into the different layers is challenging and fun i'd recommend it to everyone.
B008YUHQ3M|5.0|The movie's great, and the 3D is as good as it was when I watched it in the theaters! However, you shouldn't bother buying the 3D version of part 1, because that 3D isn't good at all. Just buy the regular blu-ray of that. My guess is that if it wasn't 3D in the theaters, they don't bother doing a good job of making it 3D for home video.
B001AUKUUO|5.0|This is White Lion at their absolute best. This disc from the opening track displays phenomenal vocals and overall musicianship and delivers some of the best songwriting of the 1980's. Mike Tramp's vocals and Vito Bratta's guitar virtuoso stand out on all tracks. This is a must have for any fan of 80's music !!!! Not one filler track on the whole disc !!!!
B008NEMPTO|5.0|...and great 3D. I really enjoyed the movie, making Abraham Lincoln into a vampire hunter. I liked the way they mixed history into fiction.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|good game it has alot of hidden objects! good story line! I have been playing it for a couple of days; most games don't last this long its worth the money
B008UZ7MUI|1.0|The movie's great, but the 3D isn't good at all. It didn't seem like 3D at all! However, part 2 is great in 3D. the menu was the most impressive 3D effect on the blu-ray. My guess is that if it wasn't 3D in the theaters, they don't bother doing a good job of making it 3D for home video.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I can't tell you what a huge Dickens fan I am. this is one of my all-time favorites. Scrooge has such a sense of humor! Wonderful story!
B0026O475M|5.0|A funny heartwarming classic of how a man ends up on an island and how he copes with the struggles he faces.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great app but sometimes it doesn't load.  so I used the home button and restart app then it works.  you take care of your own digital horse. what girl wouldn't love that besides having a real one to ride.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Lots of suspense and a real look into the crazy and often evil natures of the human race, yet the constant hope that we can be better, kinder, more loving.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is cool. The graphics are good. The only problem is that you do have to play a lot if you don't want to spend actual money. The challenges are great. I recommend this game for kids and teens. And adults if they have time.
B00003CXCD|5.0|I love this movie. I want on blu-ray, please.Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck did an amazing couple. It is refreshing and funny. Very lovely.
B002WBZD02|5.0|It's been a long time, depending on how old you are, the span of your movie preferences in terms<br />of year released, your willingness to check out films dating back so far. I have a movie from 1946<br />and that is Casablanca. Probably as far back as I have real interest. Except for some horror.  OK,<br />so just from watching the clips from the Next Get Shorty Film, I elected not to watch movie no. 2<br />with Uma Thurman and Johnny Knoxville.<br /><br />Okay, I don't want you to kill me. I did NOT ask for no mayonnaise, and I also had bell peppers<br />put on the pizza. So, I'll ask you questions, but I will answer them, too. And MAYBE it will not<br />be as spoiled as your 2 nephews.  1. Why does Momo have a coronary? He goes to a surprise<br />party. And he is surprised. Okay, okay, okay(Joe Pesci is not in this, sorry. Look for Casino. Better<br />yet look for Wise Guys, if you don't already have three copies). Chili Palmer breaks Ray Bones's<br />nose. Why? Because Bones takes Chili's coat at the restaurant.  3. Who is the restaurant owner<br />at the restaurant? That part is played by Vito Scotti, who is also one of Vito Corleone's \\"customers\\".<br />Why does Karen Flores wear hot pants? Because she has nice legs. Is that the right answer? Is<br />David Paymer on a roll? Why or why not? David Paymer plays the guy who fakes his own death,<br />and no. He likes to gamble too much. Why should Harry Zimm watch out for Doris? Doris is played<br />by Bette Midler. I don't know. Maybe it's the corset. James Gandolfino works for who? That man<br />who loves his daugher very much, and is also an actor in GS, works for another piece<br />of garbage just Ray Bones. You will discover why I say that, but I won't be at the airport.<br />Gandolfino was in what long-running cable series? What? You expect me to tell you everything?<br /><br />.
B00709GTGS|5.0|Kate & Leopoldo make a dream lovely couple between the real world and past. Hugh Grant looks fantastic and Meg did a real life of a working woman Very romantic movie.
B000F3A7LO|5.0|This album is a must have for people who enjoy classic prog rock. The 2CD set has many interesting bonus tracks
B003ZSJ212|2.0|OK- Here I'm reviewing the packaging of these films- not the films themselves. Is anyone else getting ANNOYED at the way Fox is packaging their multiple disc sets??? After charging ALOT of moola to upgrade to Blu-ray versions of their movies, you'd think they would at least give us durable cases to protect our investments. Nooooo!! What we get are these stupid bound sleeves that one has to pry the disc from, dirtying the disc itself with fingerprints. They did this with Avatar 3-disc version,the Alien Anthology, and whatever else I didn't buy. I don't see Warner Bros doing this with Harry Potter or the Lord of the Rings sets!! The LOTR box has awesome cases for us. And it's not about being green with these paper holders; after all, some of us are film lovers and collectors and want cases that do what they're supposed to do- protect the disc. Actually it is about being green- how much green the studios can collect while giving us the purchasers the bare minimum!!! And don't get me going on those crappy, flimsy single DVD and Blu-ray cases with all the holes in them. How many of you folks stuck your finger right through the hole AND the insert??!! It's Your Money People! I know some folks treat these items as throwaway consumables; but for the rest of you cineastes- aren't you fed up yet???
B0060MYM7O|3.0|I liked the first year but this season seemed to go much slower and didn't grab my interest as much.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|LA is still the same place with the gangs running the streets and LA police having to resort to all tactics
B00AR9GKJY|5.0|Its still early in 2013 but I think the will be my favorite album of the year. If you are thinking about this album pick it up.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|I loved Lost when I watched it on TV and now being able to watch it on my Kindle one episode after another it is beyond amazing. There has been nothing like it since . . .
B007O3BGZE|5.0|This was my first time listening to an It Bites album and it was a great place to start.<br />One of my favorite albums of 2012
B008JFUUIA|4.0|A fun movie. I took my 13 year old and all her girlfriends to see in the theatre and we followed up by buying the DVD when it became available. Some of the language a little raunchy. Many funny scenes. Also there were plenty of jokes insulting people from every walk of life - fat people, Asians, Lesbians, etc. They could have left that stuff out and it still would be a funny movie.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Action start to to finish. Shia LEbOUF FANS will be thrilled with this action packed movie.You will love it<br />Very fast shipping.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|For the dance movie lover especially teens, this is a hit. The dancing is AMAZING! The leads very cute. It will have you dancing in your seat. The making of the movie behind the scenes really informative and interesting as well. We love Twitch too and he is in this movie. A must see!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is one of his best.  Great switch in the middle.  I never guessed it was going to end that way!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Can't praise enough! I loved every season on PBS and get to relive them by owning the DVD. I even got my 13 year old to watch the DVD and she was not easy to convince that they were worth watching. She became hooked like me and is now begging for Season 4 when it comes out. Love the Series!!!!
0073398101|5.0|This book is really riveting; there is a lot of subtle symbolism and the plots and social commentary really tells a lot about the time period this was written.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It ended so great. She finally became e somewhat happy. Who knew all those people would have to die just to male it better. This is a must read.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|ON THE WEB SITEIT SHOWED A CLIP. WHEN I GET IT, THEIRS NO CLIP. I CALLED LIFEPRO, I WAS TOLD THAT A CLIP COST 29.99.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|She is so beautiful... every song on this CD is great.  She has a very earthy and deep tone to her voice.  A little country with some Rock.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a good way to pass time. I am kind of addicted. Try it out and you will be too!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I normally don't read books like this.I stick to sci-fi and Stephen king.I saw the commercials for the movie and being from south Jersey and roaming the streets of Collingwood, I was intrigued.I also bleed green and know the pain of being an Eagles fan.That being said,this book was fantastic.The story flows well,you can relate to the main character.You really wind up liking everyone in the book.It's a can't put it down,feel good book.I highly recommend it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book was great I couldn't put it down now I can't wait for the next one!! Why so far away lol
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An incredible story that stays with you long after reading it......I think about it daily..... It makes you think about the human mind and how we can overcome incredible issues.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|This book was so different in topic that I stayed intrigued with each page.  You will enjoy it too.  Give it a read.
030758836X|3.0|I didn't like this book. The two main characters are writers and they tell their story in the first person.  The bloated egos of these two people is evident.  Their verbal gymnastics makes it a difficult read at first.  Both are showing off.  They fill their stories with smug self-deprecating remarks to let you know that they are smarter than you.  Perhaps that was the author's intent, but it irritated me.<br /><br />The plot line was excellent until the conclusion, full of twists and turns, but it bored me.  I am sorry. I am looking at the raving reviews and am wondering what I missed.<br /><br />I think part of the problem is neither character is likeable. Again, this might have been the author's intent. Their lack of likeability is part of the plot.<br /><br />The ending seemed rushed and for me it fell flat.<br /><br />I gave it three stars, because of the plot.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The story was wonderful, the acting was wonderful. I traditionally love almost any true story. I would recommend this to anyone. The movie was a little longer but worth watching.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I read it because a client recommended it. It was a slow moving story that at points stressed me to the max. I'm feeling let down by the ending.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Highly addictive, very easy, and a lot of fun!  My wife, my daughter and I am enjoy playing this game.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The author did great with this book like her last ones, but she really didn't end this story well. I was disappointed.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Lots of great stories included from business, medicine, sports and other fields, and from individual people. The stories Duhigg tells alone make the book worth reading. He flows perfectly from anecdotes to explaining conceptual or scientific information. The entire book is well organized and thoroughly thought out. Once you start reading it, you'll understand why circles (or loops) are featured prominently on the cover and throughout the design and the illustrations in the book. I look forward to rereading some of the interesting and useful parts of the book.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love this show it just gets better and more interesting each season!<br />hope its around for atleast 3 more seasons.
B0063IH60K|5.0|So much fun I play it all the time. Fun!!!<br /> Great game to play at home or on the go.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator app! I use it a lot! I downloaded it because it has a % button. Not that many do.
006198969X|5.0|General book on her style, some useful hints. Mostly LC style Was what I expected. Easy read, refer to it weekly.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|Great movie! The streaming of this film was less than desirable. Halfway through the film, I experienced buffering issues which lasted for 10 - 15 minutes.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great time waster I play it in the car because it doesn't require internet it is also very addicting it give it  5stars I love the new updates and everything!!!!
B0091LF2QQ|5.0|I got this cd for my daughter, but I must admit that I enjoy it just as much as she does.  Great music!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A real page turner, well written and lots of plot twists. Overall, an enjoyable read once you get into it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Wow, hats off to our hero's, just a great book, if you love our military then this book is a must buy!
B007FC3AAI|5.0|i been wanting  this dvd for a awhile since i saw it in the movies. It came new and it was shipped quickly and i enjoyed it and it was a great buy
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I wish I could give it more stars! I've told all my friends and family about this show and they love it, too!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I can't believe I waited till now to buy this movie!  The 3 disk set is full of great stuff!<br /><br />Great movie from start to finish!  Great experience with the seller. Package arrived quickly and in great condition as described by the seller!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Kids love it and I'm starting to play as well but so far it's still a little simple. I can't wait for the tougher levels.
B005PK553C|5.0|I was hooked from the first episode.  Weird at times, more than a few WTF moments.  Well worth a watch<br /><br />Season 2 is also good BTW
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I thought the characters were developed well, and the story was interesting as well as realistic.
630471193X|5.0|Love John travolta, bought this for my mum and she was so happy with it. It's such a good movie, and sad but good none the  less!
B008P1EWIM|1.0|It was only working about half the time and it was draining the battery on my Kindle.  The screen was beautiful, but it sure didn't keep me up to date on the weather!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book an  I can't wait to read the second one, it was amazing really. I loved it.
B000244FDW|5.0|The casting is impeccable, David Rintoul in general out-Darcy's Mr Darcy. The style of the series has an elegance and period feel a little lacking in some of the other versions.The costumes are amazingly well done, as are the hairstyles, and sets, meeting the usual high-standard of any Masterpiece Theatre production. I will enjoy this again and again.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My sister and I love this game. We play it everyday. It's addicting. I start up all night playing this game
B007IXWKUK|5.0|highly recommend. Very intense content.  I can't wait to read the third and final Fifty Shades.  There are many surprises throughout the book that keeps you wanting to go on.  Could not put it down.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a fun addicting game but since it updated all my friends keep getting deleted....also when I go to some of the friends villages it freezes up and won't let me do anything. Only thing I'm starting to hate about it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was not sure what to expect when I first started reading this trilogy.  It became very apparent right from the start that these books are very erotic.  However, there is an underlying story behind the relations.  Who is Christian Grey really?  Keep reading to find out.  Kept me up very late at night on several occasions.  Gave to my husband for Valentine's day to read!
B00BHMETKC|2.0|15 mins into the movie and you already know what the movie ending is going to be like, the description Amazon give make you think the movies an action, drama, but its just another movie....2stars
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so addictive&hellip; Once you complete one goal you will want to complete the next goal right away&hellip; Can't put it down for too long&hellip; Have to play this game more and more.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I went to see this movie in the theatre with my 14 year old son. We both thought it was great. Then I watched it again at home with my husband. Just as good the second time through. Smart, suspenseful, seems to be largely historically accurate. Memorable characters and lines. I think this is one of those movies that I would watch every time it's on.
6305128952|5.0|Love Robert Reford. This is a welcome addition to my DVD library. Product arrived on time and in secure packaging.  Plays well.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|Tim Ferris is a tornado of energy and opinion, but he is entertaining and a lot of what he has to say is worth hearing.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Well written.  Expresses the life of a soldier exceptionally well.  Tells facts about the war in Iraq that were not previously known, especially about the battle in Fallujah.  Un afraid to expose the difficulty the military family has with repeated deployments, the author clearly defines one of the biggest challenges our military faces, family or duty.  This book should be required reading for all political leaders to make them more aware of the actual battles our military face in their day to day lives, as well as the lives their families are required to endure.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|This is a weird weird weird movie. Sexual situations may offend some. At the end I didn't know what I was supposed to get out of it. But Joaquin Phoenix, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams deserved their acting nominations if you can separate acting from quality of the movie as a whole.  Emperor's new clothes perhaps? I watched with another 60 year old and 2 30-somethings and we all had the same reaction.
B009O2XY12|4.0|Like the game it is fun you have to look at the move and see if you can bank it or not
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|For almost fifty years this book has been on my list of the five best books I've ever read. See if you don't agree with me, even if, like me, you flatly refuse to accept the ... supposedly magnificent end result.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Well written and told the story in words today's readers can easily understand. Treated a sad subject with great compassion.
B0080MJYR0|4.0|I doubt you could really call this Sci-Fi as much as a 60's expression of the future.  They really dropped the money into the sets and photography as the money holds up against today's computer generated content.  It was interesting to see themes from Barbarella that were picked up in later Sci-Fi movies.<br /><br />I watched it several years ago and was interested to see if I had remembered all of it.  I suspect the version I saw earlier had been on WTBS (owned by Ted Turner) and had been edited for TV.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I always keep an eye on the weather. I watch the Weather Channel at least a few times a day. Now I can take it with me where ever I go, how great is that.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Very seldom at the end of a film have I felt like standing up and applauding.  However Tom Hooper's version of the West End and Broadway smash hit left me begging for more. The central performances are just fantastic: Hugh Jackman is both appealing yet determined as Valjean, while Russell Crowe is just a revelation as Javert. Never have I seen Crowe better cast; the role could have been made for him as the ever-vigilant officer of the law, determined to pursue Valjean at all costs, yet finding himself unable to carry out his stated mission of killing the ex-convict off.  Crowe also possesses an attractive singing voice that reaches its apotheosis in two solo numbers.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway has a comparatively small role as Fantine, but she is likewise wonderfully cast, with an expressive singing voice.  She not only has two solo numbers, but she has a memorable death-scene, as Valjean cradles her head and she imagines her daughter Cosette appearing in front of her.<br /><br />The production also contains two comic cameos by Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen.  As she matures, Bonham Carter is becoming an accomplished character actor with a penchant for musicals (remember SWEENEY TODD); in this film she has a memorable number with Baron Cohen (who bears a startling resemblance to the late British satirist Peter Cook).<br /><br />For those who haven't seen the stage production, Hooper's film version tells the story crisply yet lucidly.  The orchestrations are just fantastic, while the ensemble cast (all of whom sung live on camera, rather than miming to playback) create great production numbers.  Add to that some memorable photography, and you have a film that is quite simply wonderful; the best musical I have seen for many a decade.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Graphics are good ,game is quick. Pop ups are annoying. For a free app it is a great starter to help get you acquainted with your kindle.
B009X01C64|5.0|I would recommend this case to anyone that is looking for a Kindle case. It is very easy to insert the Kindle into the case and once inserted it is a snug fit. The Kindle will not shift or move at all once inserted. It is also fairly easy to remove from the case if need be. Some reviews mentioned an offensive odor produced by this case. I did not smell any odor at all. The case does add some weight to the device, but it is not unbearable. Any case is going to add some weight. It is a sleek looking case and the strap that holds it closed is a must in my opinion.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone.  It's inspiring kept me interested through the whole book.  Will read again and again
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book...poorly written but the story is somehow captivating! I liked this version because it was easily accessed on my phone!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Can't wait for the return of this show.  It really was an enjoyable show to watch.  I highly recommend it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book...poorly written but the story is somehow captivating! I liked this version because it was easily accessed on my phone!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This story was a referral from my 8th grade social studies teacher (I am in my 40s), and he was absolutely right. It's a very relevant book for any age, and even though it tells a story we've heard in Anne Frank's Diary or Number the Stars, it was written with a unique twist: it is told from the perspective of Death himself. And, you can't say that Hitler's Germany is a topic that has been exhausted. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop, and the size of the book made for a very happy reader who is used to finishing a book in two days as I had it around for a while due to its lengthy story and great details.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Fun and easy to read! Sucks you in, making you laugh, cry, and wish it wouldn't end! Would recommend to any fellow reader.
0802130208|5.0|I loved this book and although I didn't find it hilarious, the story, writing and characters were genius.  I also felt resentful that the author took his life and we never got to read the sequel, because surely it begs for one.  Having finished it a week ago, here I am still drifting back to the story and missing it and the characters.  I'm dispirited knowing it's not waiting on the nightstand to read tonight.  My only consolation is I will read it again.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was enjoyable. But not very memorable.  I can't remember the storyline or the characters or the ending.  Not really much of a read.
B0091XRT88|5.0|This is one of Clint Eastwood's best films and definitely his best western.  His character transformation throughout the movie is brilliant.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I keep this one in my car, one of four or five discs that gets played regularly. Previously, I can't say that I was a particular fan of Tony Bennett. I bought this because of some of the other artists he collaborated with. However, I've listened to this one so much that I ended up receiving Duets I as a gift recently. Love that disc also.
B003V1WTMM|1.0|I can't believe that Kate Morton wrote this book!  Having read The Secret Garden I was anticipating the same strength and literary competency in this book.  But alas, lots of verbiage, not really a story, it just went on and on and on.  Even though I skipped several pages/chapters, I finally quit!!!  Very disappointing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is just a great series. If you love period pieces and UK series Downton Abbey is for you. Make sure you watch the first two seasons before this so you're up to date on all the goings on of the house staff and the family.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|What can I say? It's Dr Who. It's brilliant, clever, funny, crazy, happy, sad, wonderful and amazing. My favorite show of all time.
B002NVTSGQ|4.0|Love this first season. I think it's better than the other seasons but I know many people who loved all the seasons. Great characters and lot of laughs.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Matt Smith is simply amazing as the doctor. The way that he can show the doctor as utterly genius and yet at the same time show him having difficulty understanding some basic human social interactions is just incredible. He's caring and brilliant and funny and yet sometimes he doesn't quite &#34;get it&#34; which is the way the doctor should be.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|As I read this book I highlighted Enzo's (the dog) words of wisdom. The books does start off like it's just another dog who ends up dying and our hearts are broken - BUT IS NOT!!! Keep reading and pay attention to what Enzo has to say and in the end you will be so uplifted you'll want to read it again. This is a life affirming book. The kind of book that can change your life a bit. As I said I highlighted quite a bit of Enzo's observations and thoughts and I sometimes go back and read a few - they are that inspirational. If you're a dog lover I think this reaffirms that the dogs we love have a soul. Even if you're not a dog lover you'll love the story.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|Unlimited possibilities when motion is added to color, shape and design. I love it ---/t be careful to not get dizzy!
B00BGZ8OLA|2.0|not fun.................not worth the time.  Good effects and very realistic but overall  ho hmm.  Story has little cheer or omph
B00881VLCE|2.0|I did love this game. I worked all of the free puzzles that came with the app then purchased more.. after working a couple of them I went out of the app.. when I try to get back into the app, it does not open.. there is only a blank screen.. I uninstalled and reinstalled and I could then open it, until I again closed the app and tried to reopen it. This game would get a 5 star rating from me if it werent for this issue... this also includes having a set of 5 pieces already put together to disappear on you... VERY UPSET!!!
B00A757EFW|2.0|I have found that even by using my new stylus I can't move fast enough.  Frustratingingly so and will probably delete.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was very deep, not just a girl meets boy, trouble, resolution etc. Very good character development, unique story that makes you empathize and root for the main girl, you really &#34;get&#34; her, and forgive her for her mistakes, I highly recommend this to women readers.
B0037VNX44|5.0|After watching this movie I looked up his workout books on Amazon.  You don't need a fancy gym or tons of equipment, you just need to be crazy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was leary of this series because of the movie conection but after seeing the movie i decided to read it i was pleasently suprised and could not put it down i would highly recomend this book not only to kids but would incourage adults to read it also
B002O2THRO|5.0|He is good in everything, may he live forever.  Hopefully the remake does not suck, I joined the mob because of this movie.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Not at all what we thought it was going to be. Depicted all the faults and struggles this guy lived with and not a hero who was unjustly accused. Denzel proved himself to be the quality actor he has so many times before. Well worth your time and you won't leave the room.
B001FB55I0|5.0|It´s a goog movie, i prefer the story of sending terminators back to the past instead of all the new drama in the future, but this movie has good visual effects
B0095P29EG|2.0|Great for the kids I guess. Just not into the genre and watched because we needed some veg time to relax. Glad we did not pay for it
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Not true to the period but still good story.  Would recommend if you are not a history buff.  Fun.  Probably would re-read.
B008KZVNLC|4.0|Parade's End will likely confuse Downton Abbey fans at first because it is a completely different (as in much more complex) kind of narrative and its characters are much more modern (as in divided and uncertain creatures not all of a piece with themselves or their time periods). It is about a hyper-Torified aristocrat named Christopher Tietjens who wants not to be a hyper-Torified aristocrat and thus sabotages his own historical trajectory (usually a job done by WWI in Edwardian character and class pieces) by impulsively marrying himself off to his opposite, the hyper-modern anti-Toff Sylvia Satterthwaite (who will immediately annoy some and thrill other viewers, Lady Mary she's not). He questions his decision even before he goes through with it but go through with it he does. Outwardly, he stays with her out of honor (or at least that is what he would like others to believe and perhaps what he himself would like to believe), but the undeniable and ineluctable attraction reveals that Tietjens is never completely certain of his own motives. The characters don't know what quite to make of themselves and we don't know what quite to make of them (except that everyone and everything is coming undone and sex, more than WWI, seems to be the reason why). Every scene of this series is disorienting and each new character introduced opens up another level of confusion and layer of uncertainty. I guess the idea is that we, like the characters, aren't supposed to be able to orient ourselves in this inbetween world (the past is dying but not quite dead, the future is kicking but as yet unborn) that satisifes no one (if so, this thing is a magnificent success). Parade's End is like the avant-garde anti-dote to Downton Abbey (and its carefully managed Victorian narrative that allows everyone ample time to decide who they want to be and which historical epoch--the Victorian or the modern, which seem to co-exist in relative harmony--- best suits the character they've so carefully developed and the life they've so carefully chosen). In Parade's End there is no time for such calculations. The upheaval's are more cognitive than social and the characters are incapable of self-adjustment or compromise or definitive action (every action in this series seems to be followed by a reversal), so the drama is primarily internal and unresolved. Even the author seems uncertain what to do with his characters (and seems more comfortable moving back and forth in time than in proceeding forward). Its very un-British really (more storm and stress than staid and steady) so its no surprise that this was written by Ford Madox Ford (whose father was German). Oh dear (we can all hear Violet saying). In these period and character studies, the hope (expressed by the characters) is that the war will resolve or at least simplify things and make them clearer (as in make social distinctions less clear and life easier for all concerned). In Downton this is not the case, as Matthew becomes more of a Toff (and preserver of social distinctions) after the war than he ever was before the war; however, this is true in Parade's End, where the war does indicate to Tietjens that in this new world, honor, while still important and valued by some, is no longer a value that holds the world together (and can even be destructive when wrongly applied). But what really distinguishes these two series from one another is not in the way they each treat war but in the way they each treat desire and its effect on consciousness and perspective. At Downton, desire (Matthew's desire for Mary) is what preserves rank and privilege and point of view; whereas in Parade's End, desire (Tietjens desire for Sylvia) is what makes Tietjens realize that his own perspective is a limited one. And this difference is, in the end, what separates the Tory construction that is Downton Abbey (and its vision of Brits as exemplary epoch and epoch-transtion managers) from the modernist construction that is Parade's End(wherein entire world views and psychologies are made obsolete in the course of one passionate afternoon long before the war, even though it may take a war and the destruction of a world and of a make-believe class---and of a tree--- to convince Tietjens that this is so and for him to begin to view the world and his place in it through a new multi-perspectived--modernist-- lens because of it).(wherein entire world views and psychologies are made obsolete in the course of one passionate afternoon long before the war, even though it may take a war and the destruction of a world and of a make-believe class---and of a tree--- to convince Tietjens that this is so and for him to begin to view the world and his place in it through a new multi-perspectived--modernist-- lens because of it).
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Mr. Baldacci does not ever disappoint the reader in any one of his intrigue filled novels. &#34;Split Second&#34; will keep you on the edge of your seat, throughout the entire book. He has a God given talent for developing plots, that cannot be easily deciphered, therefore, making this novel, as well as, the rest of his books, top rated in all categories!
B005PK56TA|5.0|I did not expect to like this series.  I was encouraged to watch it by a co-worker.  I really enjoyed it.  It was very interesting and suspenseful..  Almost like a Supernautural &#34;Lost&#34; series..  If you liked Supernatural and Lost, I think you will enjoy this series.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|If you can get past the idea that you're some sort of pathogen and your goal is to wipe out everybody, the game play itself is smooth with excellent graphics of the globe.  You spread across the world using animated airplanes and ships.  Too bad the developers don't have a more positive alternative, such as spreading literacy instead of disease.  Better than zombies, I guess.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This movie opened my eyes to so many unknwon facts , it also made me see my own government from a different view
B001MEJY8W|5.0|If you are a person who can handle gory/violent images, then this is just the beginning for this film.  This film makes you really think about reality and twists what you believe upside down.  It was shocking and kept me enthralled the whole time.  There are a few story lines running into each other here.  The main one deals with abuse and how the victim handles her rage years later; and how we become shaped by our past (I can't give away too much here).  And the other deals with a deeper conspiracy she has no idea she was a part of (again, can't give away too much here).  All I can say is that people who like their films a bit deeper will not be disappointed.
B001TODCII|5.0|Great Movie I would recomend this movie for anyone who like non - stop action Liam Neeson was off the charts
B007WULJ5G|4.0|Man oh man...I have to say that with all the reviews I read about this film...it did not disappoint.  It was sick, twisted, and very unsettling...but I have to say that I liked it.  I watched it more than once.  I am just as shocked that I am saying this.  And a little unsettled...as a woman, I think that I am almost programmed to loath it.  There are many images/scenes of women being degraded.  But to me, these women and just &#34;props&#34; in the film to be used for the real purpose of the Director in the film.<br />The film was beautifully shot and the music was perfect, too.  It gave the whole thing the atmosphere necessary.<br />This film is about a down and out ex-porn star who was huge (pun intended) in Serbia and is offered a final job from an obscure Director through  of his old costars as contact.  This sum of money would finally set his family (a wife and son) for life.  What follows is a walk through hell...where everyone is involved and there is no escape.  I can't give too much away but If you can't handle brutal (and I mean brutal) images, then don't even bother.
B009AOFNU4|1.0|I have tested this on iPad, iPhone, Galaxy Nexus and Galaxy Tab.<br />It is easy to pair this device but apart from this. Nothing is easy.<br /><br />The Steel Series app for Android doesn't do anything to facilitate key inputs at all.<br />Do you guys download the app? I'm afraid that I have downloaded the wrong app thus I have double checked it again.<br /><br />I have tried the games on the compatibility list and followed all the instructions on the website. But the game just couldn't work!<br />Angry Birds, Dead Trigger, Car Track, Temple Run and so on. Only Sonic was able to fully utilised the controller.<br /><br />I was really pissed and went to borrow some iOS devices to try.<br />NOPE, doesn't work too.<br /><br />I really want to know what I am doing wrong.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first book is awesome. Three books were just not enough. This book did a great job of drawing you in.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Collins conjures an all-too-plausible future from the past. We dare not huff and puff that we are better than she thinks. We already have Games like Survivor, and we already have carnage-based entertainment. How much of a nudge do we need to go for the bread and circuses ourselves?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is a lot of fun. I would get it 'cause its free and doesn't take up much spaces.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was the first book that keep my interest I a very long time. It made me laugh, cry, and dance all at the same time. Most of the time I could not wait to finish my day so I could find out what Ana and Christian was getting into next. There were Times when I know my face was super red!! I enjoyed this book an cannot wait to start the next book. Thank you.
B00000373U|5.0|This album is truly a masterpiece.  There's really not much else that I can say.  The guy wasn't gifted with a great voice, but he could write a song like no other.  He was also a very smart lyricist.  His choice of words were extremely well thought out, unpredictable, original, and never boring.  It is quite a gift for someone to be able to write lyrics that aren't nonsensical which can lead to so much speculation and analysis.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I'm really enjoying Elementary Season 1, but it reminds me more of House (which of course is based on Sherlock Holmes), than of more faithful Sherlock Holmes adaptations. This is no bad thing. If you are prepared to accept a woman playing Watson and a Sherlock in New York, you'll enjoy it.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Who doesn't love How I Met You Mother!!  Highly recommend watching all of them though, in order.  It does make a difference
B005HSL626|5.0|it is so so so so so So so so so so so so so so so cool jdjdjsjhdhehdhdbbs. wind hes Ned b /  J's.  Jsandye. bsj
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is really good!  I was able to watch Seasons 1 and 2 on Prime and then had to buy Season 3 because it is so good!
B005LAII12|5.0|The movie arrived undamaged and we were able to enjoy viewing it immediately. It was as described. I will order more movies soon as this was a positive experience
B002UXRH10|5.0|I am not a huge R&B fan --I listen to hard rock and metal--but decided to buy this album after hearing Rihanna live on the '12 Victoria's Secret fashion show (&#34;Diamonds&#34;). I've played this CD non-stop for the past week. Not only is her voice well-suited to the songs, the production is very impressive. I would recommend &#34;Rated R&#34; to anyone interested in Rihanna's stylistic range and to anyone who likes their music a little harder-edged.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I have only played a short time, so far this is what I can tell you :<br />CONS : *VERY long download - at least 40 minutes<br />  *Just when you think you're done, the game needs to install. It took approximately 2 HOURS! I have a fairly high speed Internet connection as well.<br />PROS:  *Storyline is magnificent.<br />  *Graphics are awesome.<br />  *Puzzles aren't too hard but if you get stuck, there is a hint button.<br />  *You can zoom in closer than any other hidden object game I've played. Helps tremendously.<br />IN SHORT: *Despite the ridiculously long download & install times, it is well worth the wait. You won't be disappointed.
B0045XKJBI|2.0|My wife and I both watched this episode.  She liked it, but the subject but I found it to be tedious.
B005BUZJ6O|5.0|This is a new duo for me.  Their energy is exciting.  While I love Yo Yo Ma, these young men add a new dimension to the cello.  Very talented musicians.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Just as good as the first season.  Loved the series.  Very well acted and brings the historic characters to life.  But Henry VIII was enormous in his later years and the lead here is not, but Johnathon Meyers' acting makes it unimportant.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Hope that wasn't your favorite character.  Game of Thrones continues to excel in it's gritty realism fantasy with all the same quirks that fans fell in love with.  Read it
B001PU8N0I|4.0|Arrived quickly and as described.  Its a great bbc mini series adaptation of charles dickens novel, Little Dorrit.  well acted and directed.
B005WYFLNU|4.0|Our 6 year old has had hours of fun with this. It's a great quiet activity that she can do by herself or with someone else. The only 2 drawbacks are: (1) Some of the stickers can be a bit difficult for little fingers to peel and (2) Where to store them when not in use. Neither is a huge problem, however. I would buy this again any time.
B00866JL96|5.0|Received this movie on time and as shown.  We really liked the movie, it was well acted and makes a great date night flick
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I really like this game. It's a simple match game but with a twist. When you run out of matches, rotate the cube and there's more. I don't care for the timer but it's not a countdown timer. You can play a relaxed game and just find matches at your leisure or you can try and beat your time and set a new record. What I like about it is if you can see it and touch it, you can match it. When finding matches on different sides of the cube, I find that it's better to touch the screen just to the side of the cube because if you accidentally touch a different square, it will choose that square. Great game. Loads quickly.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I found it very interesting. The details were flawless. I felt I was right beside him in his struggle to survive.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|easy to use and fun to play my little sister loves it!  the app freezes sometimes but restarting it usually helps.  if you are looking for a horse game where you can feed and care for the horse this is perfect
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game and the graphics aren't bad. Started out with no ads in it but now that I've been playing more keep showing up.
B00785P2QC|1.0|dont get me wrong its got a good way about it but it just crashes my kindle everytime i start it up. dont take my word if you dont want to it just crashes my kindle. once it froze it for three weeks.
B005CS3VQ0|5.0|I think it is an excellent book to read if you are in the translation world. It helps to understand many processes during the translation experience.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|I liked the book and I've seen so many movies based off the story, but this to me is just a classic version. Disney did a pretty good job with the story and keeping it decent for younger viewers. I like the creativity too. Disney Classics are hard to beat when it comes to animated movies.<br /><br />This edition, Masterpiece, is really coool too becasue it has so much bonus material. They have a song for the Cheshire cat that no one really knew about and they ended up not even using in the movie. I really enjoy this DVD and would recomend it it if anyone likes Disney Classics or Alice in Wonderland stories. It's defnitely a must have.
B008EOVHXI|5.0|This recording is phenomenal. Ms. Lisitsa commands the music and brings out depths and nuances that I had previously missed. A truly magnificent experience for your listening pleasure.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great tips for fitness, meals, beauty, home decorating, etc.  I am also into photography and there are many great suggestions and ideas for future shoots.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is the best Clancy book I have read in quite a while.  It kept me glued to the book from start to finish.  I could see them making a movie from this.  If you like Tom Clancy don't miss out on this excellent book.
B009GEOLM4|5.0|This movie had an awesome story and looked great visually. I did not read the comic book, but I heard from someone who did that it was on par.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|This movie was amazing... specially considering the time when Temple was growing up and the stigma that Autism carried.. How dare they blame a mother for an autistic child. Simply inspirational.
B00B7G3BUW|5.0|This movie had an awesome story and looked great visually. I did not read the comic book, but I heard from someone who did that it was on par.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This book is a classic that everyone should read as a child and re-read as an adult. It brings out the  adventure seeking child in everyone.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Just an Outstanding Series, Well, it just is a Great Great Story and show. We enjoy story line so much. The actors have done a super job! will miss it when they stop. You can't wait for the next show.
B008F9E306|5.0|I've been a Tip fan since day one, but this is has to be his most creative and smoother album of them all.  The beats are tight and the lyrical content is brilliant.  Tip continues show why with every album he puts out his craft matures and resonates (even for the casual hip-hop listener).<br /><br />My favorite songs on the album are: \\"Sorry\\" w/Andre 3000 (I'm telling you all it's time for Andre to put out a solo album), \\"Guns & Roses\\" w/P!nk (a romantic street-love track with one of blue-eyed soul/rock's finest showing off her vocals), \\"Crusin\\" (sexy, has a Drake-swag, definitely will get the ladies going), Wildside w/ASAP Rocky (another hood-rich on living the fine life within the culture), Ball w/Lil Wayne (DJ Jimi's booty bass of 1992's 'Where They At' mixed raunchy, sexualized lyrics, good if you are fan it).<br /><br />The whole album overall is pretty exceptional, so if you don't have it get it - NOW!  Don't just buy singles, buy the WHOLE ALBUM.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|Well, it just is a Great Great Story and show. We enjoy story line so much. The actors have done a super job! will miss it when they stop.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am glad kindle has an application. Works great. I do wish the kindle worked more like my Iphone tho.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Easy read, I loved the storyline I cried and laughed so it was a pretty good mixed of happy romantic and depressing
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle was a true American Hero. This book chronicles his service in Iraq, and the balancing act he performed to keep his family together.
B003XRELEI|5.0|I enjoy reading Vonnegut for his humor, as well as the social commentary. This is one of his best works.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is just fantastic! I can finally build the dinosaur park of my dreams! I recommend this app/game to anyone who loves dinosaurs!
B00475AYJQ|4.0|this book kept me interested throughout.  Interesting characters and detailed settings and a great sequel.  Can't wait for the third installment.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Graphics are good. I love hidden picture games! Story line is nice. Waiting for the energy to fill up can be a pain though.
0446554995|2.0|I wanted to like Two Graves, having read the 2 previous \\"Helen\\" books and since they are fiction, being more than willing to suspend my disbelief.  However, virtually everything in this book was preposterous and totally unbelievable.  Generally, Preston and Child books are real page-turners - you put everything aside and read them straight through.  This one had me shaking my head in disbelief, particularly how Preston & Childs  changed Pendergast's character from eccentric Holmesian hero-detective to eccentric, mentally-disturbed action hero. Maybe it's time for Preston & Child to let Pendergast retire and move on to something else.<br />By the way, if you want to know how Preston & Child came up with Pendergast in the first place, read a book called The Lineup, edited by Otto Penzler.  This book is a great reference to let you know how some of your favorite mystery/thriller characters moved from author imagination to printed page.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|This is an excellent read with characters finely drawn, plots thickening as they progress, and a conclusion that is just satisfying. Just an excellent read from a well established author!
B008D37J6O|1.0|There is no way to sync the audio with the video, no matter what I try, I deleted it from my tablet.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|This was all of the music from the movie, done by the characters from the movie, not some cover bands.  Great!
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|Any western with Wayne is 5, we really need someone to take over for him,it seems as he is always got other good actors to help
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Amazing music throughout the movie!  Very funny!  Loved everything about the movie and you don't have to worry about watching it with your kids.
B0015XHP4K|5.0|A gift for my husband!  We both love Rambo movies.  This is a nice collection to have for years to come.
0545425115|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book, and yet I still could NOT stop reading it! It's just such an intriguing and emotional story. I could read it over and over without getting bored.
B0093WVND4|5.0|We purchased this for our 8 year old son to read on his new Kindle Fire.  In his words.....<br /><br />&#34;I think other kids my age, both boys and girls, would think this is a great book and really funny.  Mr. Fox is a great character who does lots of interesting things.&#34;
B000PDYVVG|4.0|I thought this book might be overrated and cutesy. It is neither. The author did a wonderful job examining human feelings and experiences without being preachy, and was even funny at the same time. I recommend this book for sure.
0061978078|5.0|The ending of Delirium left me (and everyone, I'm sure) kind of in a haze with sadness and depression. I was anxious for Pandemonium to be released to find out WHAT HAPPENED TO LENA. I read it the first day it was out, in February of 2012, and my initial reaction (according to Goodreads) was this: \\"HOLY S***BALLS, BATMAN.\\" And that was pretty much my same reaction reading it this time. I just finished Requiem (review is coming!) and I can say that Pandemonium remains my favorite in the series. I remember getting to the end of this one -- Lauren Oliver has a thing for cliffhangers -- and just sitting there staring at the page. Then I got slap-happy. I liked it so much but I was so anxious for the conclusion.<br /><br />So the story itself is set up entirely different from Delirium, but I really liked how Oliver did it. We have \\"now\\" and \\"then\\" chapters that take us back and forth through time and show us Lena's evolution into a member of the Resistance! That's right! Our little heroine isn't just bucking the system, she's fighting back. I remember being shocked the first time I read it, but this time, I thought it was perfect for her. It's a great part of evolution for her character and shows how much! Somehow, Lena is able to make her way close to a camp of Invalids (over 60 miles from Portland!) who 'nurse' her back to health and then teach her how to survive in The Wilds.<br /><br />At the same time that we see Lena learning how to live in The Wilds, we see her infiltrate the DFA (Deliria Free America) in Brooklyn with two of the Invalids that she lived with in The Wilds -- Raven and Tack. With her DFA affiliation, Lena meets Julian, the director of the DFA's son and a cancer survivor who could be killed by having the cure. Through some bad luck and overall craziness, Lena and Julian are kidnapped together and when Lena starts her escape plan, she can no longer hide the fact that she's an Invalid from Julian. DUN DUN DUN.<br /><br />That's about as much of the plot that I'm going to give away because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone if you haven't read it (but you should if you haven't!) But Oliver, once again, takes us on a journey with Lena and you truly feel like you're there. You're sick and tired with Lena at the beginning and you slowly grow stronger with her as she adapts to her new life. It's impossible not to fall in love with the story she tells and the contrast of The Wilds with New York City and the two different people Lena is in each place. She also has to deal with what she's lost from the first novel and Oliver writes it in such a believable way, it's heartbreaking and beautiful.<br /><br />And let's not forget about Julian and how he and Lena love each other. Yeah, I said it. I love Lena/Julian more than anything. Neither of them wants to have feelings for the other but they're put into an intense situation and it just blossoms. They get to know each other like no one else knows them as they are now and it's amazing and THERE ARE NO WORDS. I have none.<br /><br />Then there's the last 50 pages of the book and yeah. It's killer. Definitely the best of the series and a great go-between for Delirium and Requiem. And it will leave you pretty much dead (until you get your hands on Requiem.)away because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone if you haven't read it (but you should if you haven't!)

B005FISC52|5.0|I am a total tv on  dvd junkie! I had watched all the previous seasons on dvd as well and loved them all! This one was just as good! It was more action packed compared to the previous seasons. I really enjoyed it!
0920668372|5.0|I hadn't read this book since I was a little girl. It came in the mail as I was leaving for work. I immediately opened it up, read it, and cried like a baby. I can't wait until my little girl is old enough to sing the song with me...I love this book so much!
B003L77G8I|5.0|I love to watch tv on dvd! I am a big fan Bones! This season was great! i really enjoyed it!
0679892478|5.0|&#34;Ten Apples Up on Top&#34; is a very cute story. It's easy to read and rhyme, and my daughter loves the pictures of the animals. Board Books are wonderful!
B008NNNF7G|5.0|Blackberry Smoke has a mix of country and Southern Rock that can rival Lynyrd Skynyrd, Allman Brothers, .38 Special and more. If you like this type of music, you will not be disappointed with any of their music. Their previous album was great too (Little Piece of Dixie). They are passionate about what they do and it comes through on the recordings. Also, they are a top-notch live band.
1401223176|5.0|This story is awesome! I would consider this novel a must for Batman fans. The art work is amazing and the story is well told. This mystery has many twists and turns with many popular character cameos. This was my first reading of Hush and I can't wait to get ahold of more.
1781163243|5.0|I really like it because I'm a huge Halo fan.  I really like the artwork but I don't have much more to say.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I chose to give this movie 4 stars because it surprised me. Initially I thought the concept was a little tacky. The movie was well made and very interesting. I think the back stories were handled well. There is just enough violence mixed in with humor. A good overall movie.
B00280LYHS|5.0|A great read, lots of action, humor, death, the norm. Though it's the end, it also feels like a new beginning almost. Like its the end of this story but the set up for another. A truly amazing way to end the series.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Should have been included at no charge with the Kindle Fire since the built-in camera always has a flash, which is so annoying, not to mention very unflattering!  It was cheap for the app, so I'm not complaining, but Amazon should have had this at no charge to anyone who purchased the Fire.
B0063IH60K|5.0|download was easy, and I like that it allows one to get hints on next move.  Also completes the game for one when you get near the end.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Everything by Train is great, love this CD, can't miss!  I think I own all of Train's CD's and not one has let me down..no Drive by here!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I like this game a lot. it reminds me a bit of Bioshock. it plays well and I like the story so far.some of the puzzels are a bit time consuming but other than that I love it. I plan to get it when I can.
B001N09BDS|3.0|Parts were very good, but too many slow parts to keep my interest.  Worth watching if there's nothing better available!
B003INBNXO|5.0|Great price for this movie! IP Man is insane! One of the best martial arts movies ever! I also like the sequel.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Fun movie with lots of action, entertaining for 90 minutes!  I actually watched it twice because I missed a few important minutes the first time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As usual, Downton Abby was superb with minimal buffering.  I love the Kindle app for my iPad that allowed me to watch missed episodes wherever and whenever I could.
B0029LCJJS|1.0|Sex explicit scenes,  not family friendly tv series.  I strongly suggest some guidance, maybe there is but I missed it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Up until the season 3 break I was spellbound.  I was often surprised by where the plot went.  Since the break, I have to admit I'm a little let down.  Part of this could be I was catching up before break on Netflix and then Amazon.  Now that I have to wait a week...  And, it almost seems like the pace is being slowed while the writers try to figure out where to go after the big showdown is over.  Even so, I haven't been into watching a show like this since I can't remember when.  I'm in it 'til the end!<br />If Daryl dies, we riot!!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I play it all the time it is easy and I can play it for hours I like the different levels
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|i really liked playing this game until they made my device automatically sign in to my facebook mobile device. The app now crashes EVERY time I try to play when I try to log in to retrieve my game info from Facebook. I would give the game five stars if I could actually play it again.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The three different levels/weeks all provide a thorough, effective exercise regimen that yields results.  It is designed to sculpt, burn fat, and tone muscle.  Modifiers to make the exercise easier can readily be be applied if an exercise is too difficult, and simply using heavier weights can make the workouts much more challenging. Overall, it is a thorough, great workout, and Jillian gets you to move and work hard!  Following this regime will yield significant results in the 30 days.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have to thank my friend for telling me about this book. I cannot wait to watch the movie. A must read!
1781163243|5.0|Great price as well. Must have for all aspiring game artists and anyone who appreciates the art of Halo. Alot of really good detail in here for people to go over.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I enjoy her delivery and the lyrical games she plays with her songs. They run the range of emotions though she could be reading a menu in her voice and I'd love it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great way to view the best without paying for cable tv. Hope Amazon Prime will keep good tv and movies coming.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is in top form with this one. It has everything you love about his novels...intrigue, drama, romance and high stakes at the end. Read this book when you want to really become emerssed.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|I've never understood why someone would want to use the light on their tablet or phone as a flashlight.  It just doesn't seem practical but that's just me.
B007SGM084|4.0|This book was a very good read I really did enjoy all of it.the passions, secrets, suspend, and all the glory details of how one can be so controlling and yet so loving. Anastasia and Christian was good for each other. O she brought him out of darkest and into the light, and he show her that grass is greener on the other side.

B00991TCOG|5.0|I was first introduced to Lindsey Stirling through an online video via the Piano guys.<br />After hearing her preform with them, I was curious to see if she had any albums available.<br />I came across her self titled album and decided to purchase it. It is full of beautiful, bright, upbeat tunes that inspire you to get up and move! You won't be disappointed! :)
B004LWZWGK|3.0|The first part of the movie ( the set up of the plot) the actors mumbled their lines. The difference of sound levels between the action sequences and dialog was too great. This was not the case in the first two. It ruined the first part for me but the last part of the movie was good.
B0097BY3K6|5.0|As a fan of David Garrett's self titled album, I was looking forward to listening to another musical masterpiece.<br />You won't be disappointed. :) I thoroughly enjoyed this cd!  David's musical genius has struck again! Enjoy!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I enjoy this app because it allows me to make notes during doctor appointments, tv shows, conversations, etc.  I can use it for reminders of something I heard from someone.  I can refer to the notes when I need to or wherever I am.<br />I recommend this for anyone.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great read, love the story, passed along to my family and friends to read as well. Great book to sit and chill

B007HACDLK|3.0|Have loved Vince Flynn since he started writing, I think maybe he is running out of plots, this book was disjointed and lacking in a real plot.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game is pretty fun.  lots of variety in games which is fun.  it can take a while to unlock all the games though which is a fun challenge
B008476HBM|5.0|Great book, wonderful classic, formatted well for the Kindle. No misspellings or punctuation errors, and highly enjoyable read. The read aloud function works great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting! It's much better than temple run 2. My sister's, mom, and all of my friends are constantly playing. it is very distracting in school, but it will easily liven up a boring class
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Great book, wonderful classic, formatted well for the Kindle. No misspellings or punctuation errors, and highly enjoyable read. The read aloud function works great!
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I am not a review writer.  I read a lot of books but often can't find the words to describe what i'm feeling.  I must admit I feel a little silly.  I was excited about this book, it got great review, was a best book of 2012, it has to be good?  Right?  The first few pages of the book had me a little confused.  What?  Huh?  The words were grandiose, overdone, trying too hard.  It took all of my willpower to pick it back up.  I did not find the story believable because the characters were hard personalize.  How could they even understand each other?  My eyes did prick with tears at the end but I couldn't squeeze even a few tears out because I was so glad it was over and believe me, I cry at everything.  So read it for yourself and see what you think.  I was not impressed.  Moving on.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Great book, wonderful classic, formatted well for the Kindle. No misspellings or punctuation errors, and highly enjoyable read. The read aloud function works great!
B001TMCFFQ|4.0|This is a great book. Too many tears as usual and too many repetitions. Otherwise the story is original and for once we can see for a while the poverty instead of wealth, luxurious homes etc.<br />Sophie Krotoff
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Great book, wonderful classic, formatted well for the Kindle. No misspellings or punctuation errors, and highly enjoyable read. The read aloud function works great!
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|A great film very sad endi and the music.  I didn't care for her choice to ruin her life with.ng to the girl.  But the gowns were all lovely

B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Great book, wonderful classic, formatted well for the Kindle. No misspellings or punctuation errors, and highly enjoyable read. The read aloud function works great!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Well written book that is highly imaginative and includes fascinating characters that interplay with the  compelling existence of a very unusual circus that begins at dusk and ends at dawn.  The reader is gently brought into the enigmatic world of illusions and wonders along with the scents and smells of an idyllic kind of reality that has mysterious origins, magical itineraries, and fascinating and complex plot structure.  It's not a good vs evil story, but rather a dueling drama where affections and love struggle to assert themselves amidst a superstructure of a long standing competitive and unfeeling struggle between highly evolved manipulative illusionists.  I found the story well structured and alluring, as all magic must be to be successful, so in a sense the novel is magical in and of itself.  To what extent the reader will be amused or captivated by the magic inherent in the experience of the novel is dependent on the readers level of susceptibility and credulousness.
B002RKSZS0|5.0|Great book, wonderful classic, formatted well for the Kindle. No misspellings or punctuation errors, and highly enjoyable read. The read aloud function works great!
B0020MKTOS|5.0|There was an issue with the disc playing subtitiles only.  These guys took care of satisfing my needs immediately.  Thanks you.  We WILL do business again
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Great book, wonderful classic, formatted well for the Kindle. No misspellings or punctuation errors, and highly enjoyable read. The read aloud function works great!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I'm not sorry I read it.  I learned a lot about snipers.  Learned a lot more from a Tom Berenger movie and watching Mark Harmon on NCIS.  Snipers probably are not the best source for their personal story.  There is another book, I think it was called &#34;shooter&#34; that was more modest and gave more real information.<br />Eleanor Takahashi-Inskip
B0083Z614S|5.0|Great book, wonderful classic, formatted well for the Kindle. No misspellings or punctuation errors, and highly enjoyable read. The read aloud function works great!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is an excellent read.  Well written.  The author developed the main characters well.  My only criticism is that the supporting characters were not well developed in the book as compared to the movie.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Great book, wonderful classic, formatted well for the Kindle. No misspellings or punctuation errors, and highly enjoyable read. The read aloud function works great!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was great.  A quick read, enjoyable from start to finish.  An unbelievable journey told as a great campfire tale.  A must read.
B0031R5K72|5.0|An excellent interesting read. The fact that it is narrated by \\"  death\\" takes a bit of getting used to but do not let this put you off. The book is informative and very tender at times. One of the most enjoyable books I've read in a very long time. A wonderful story beautifully told.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love this show it is part too detective work and part comedy.  Look forward to it every week.  I buy it on amazon.com weekly
B0078N2T8I|4.0|My son recommended this movie.  he sure knows how to pick 'em. Strange movie but intriguing. If you like movies that are a little different....
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This show is one of my favorites also.  I purchase them so I can watch when i am able to.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|easy enough to learn, challenging enough to keep your attention. beautiful backgrounds, entertaining play. try it,  you will like it.
B009K0P10K|5.0|this is a great show and I enjoy watching it.  Suspenseful and just a great show.  Such a mix of characters.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Having read all the books many times over, collecting the movies was a no-brainer; all the movies parallel the books; I was always team Edward/Bella from the start.
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|It hought I would really like this show but it is a little on the boring side.  Don't care for the plot anymore.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|If you have seen the Disney version it is close to the original book and just as enjoyable. If you like a good pirate tale this is the classic work!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I have been watching Supernatural from the beginning.  I have purchase all seasons and have purchased them for my sister also.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is so cool I wish there were things asif there were on the full computer version. but it is still awesome.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Love this show.  It is one I can watch over and over again.  I have watched castle from the beginning also.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you have read The Hunger Games you absolutely HAVE TO read Catching Fire.  I was taken in from the first pages of these books.  Love the writing and the content.
0930073207|5.0|This book really gives anybody a good foundation on what economics is, how the government plays a role, and<br />studies the pros and cons of big business.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I ordered this case for my mother and got it the next day- even though I get free 2-day shipping w/Amazon prime. I was pretty surprised it came a day early. It was as descibed and my mom is soo excited about her new Kindle and her purple standing case. The most difficult thing will be teaching her how to use the thing lol
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Entertaining adult series. At first I was leary of the actor playing King Henry, but as episodes went by I found that he really plays the roll masterfully. Great quality on my kindle fire hd. On to season 2!
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Couldnt stop reading these books.  second book, maybe a bit too drawn out, but I still couldnt put it down.  Kept me awake until I finsihed the last one, keeps you interested right to the end.
B005HEQ864|5.0|My husband and I are watchers of the original series (which means we're old!)  and have watched all of the Star Trek shows, and have enjoyed them all. However STNG has always a great choice.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|The game just won't start. I'm not sure of the cause, but this is still frustrating to face. It shows the &quot;process stopped unexpectedly&quot; message, and I have no idea how to fix it. Also, this occurs every time I try to run it, right after the thing that says,&quot;Gameloft.&quot;
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am not a zombie liking person and was very hesitant to watch this show but my husband wanted to try it out so I said okay. Now I'm hooked and can't wait for the next episode. It's been a long time since I've been able to find a show that I really like. I would absolutely recommend this show to everyone!
B0011ZVPK2|5.0|I originally bought this album on cassette (hey, it was cutting edge back then!) and listened to it often.  The tape is no longer in such good shape, so when I saw this offered for $2.99, I figured I couldn't go wrong.  I absolutely love this album.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great sci-fi series. I can't get enough of it. I enjoy watching it again and again. The Amazon Prime service that I subscribed to to watch it is awesome. High quality video and sound. Great job!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love that it is a very simple app. I like playing solitaire in my spare time and this app is perfect!
B0084B5TK8|3.0|Having had never read this I was disappointed and found it very anticlamatic; not as scary as I had hoped!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I am a sucker for stories where the &#34;convenient&#34; or &#34;farce&#34; marriage ends up being a love match....not sure what that says about me...lol.  Loved this story
B004HD61KE|5.0|Good historical fiction and thought provoking possibilities. We need to see more on this subject. Edge of your seat action.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Zombies...not really my thing. Didn't start watching til a couple months ago. Kept hearing people talk about it so I decided to give it a try. Love it!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I received seasons 1 and 2 as gift and was immediately hooked. I love characters, the story, costumes, very nicely done. Getting season 3 was just very easy decision.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This book was amazing. I could not put it down.  Morgan Rice did a great job of creating a unique world to dive into. One of the best things I like about her writing, is everyone from my mother, to myself, to my children can read her books. I've read other books of hers and am equally impressed. She has become one of my favorite authors. I highly recommend reading this and her other books.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just a great game with tons of levels to play and do not burn out your battery. I like it
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I recently started watching \\"Supernatural\\" on Netflix and got HOOKED. This show is addicting - so addicting I blew through all precious seasons and NEEDED this to catch up live!
B00466H3DG|5.0|This movie is fantastic. It's original and different and if you haven't seen it, you should. The plot has fabulous twists and turns that took me for surprise when I first watched it, and made rewatching the movie over and over again even more interesting. I loved seeing things that I'd missed the first time. The acting is also fantastic. Probably my favorite performance by Jim Carey.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is the best book I have ever read. I think lots of people should read this book.<br /><br />IT IS GREAT!!!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best show on TV - hooked from the first episode of Season 1 and it kept getting better and better. Can't wait for Season 4.
B005NAE04E|5.0|Every so often a book comes along - fresh, stuffed full of thinking on the left side of the brain - so different from the mainstream.<br />Descriptive, character dimensional, plot twists, it cunningly pulls you in.  Oh why won't he write a sequel (please make it as good as this one)
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|If you like House, Psych, Monk, or any other crime drama, you'll love this. Not quite as serious and over the top as the CSI-type shows, Johnny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu are wonderful and absolutely believable as a modern day Holmes and Watson. The little lady and I watched the entire first season in just a couple of days.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I really enjoy Ken Follet and liked Winter of the World very much. It moved along very quickly. I did read the first book Fall of<br />The Giants. I am looking forward to the next book.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I love it.<br />the whole series has been very good, Walter is the greatest. Astrid makes the show.  the best sci-fi I have seen in years.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|If there was less blood and deads. But the story itself, the characters are so flat, so straght forward, so completely black or white ... This is boring.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app...very fun and there are SO many puzzle packs to choose from.  I have regretted for years that I don't have enough table space in my house to do puzzles and now I can do them anytime and anywhere!
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Want to annoy all those coworkers who play their stupid rap songs? Just put on Call Me Maybe and turn up the volume!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Clever and ingenious are adjs for this creator; multi layer challenges you have to seek out; Multi side games and puzzles with their own strategies. Patience is a virtue.  A good way to clear the mind when trying to solve other issues.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|How does Clancy manage to write a top rate novel and have the same subject scenario on the news the next day in real life! He's done it again!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read the trailer multiple times but I was never interested enough to buy the book.  I was looking for something to read and decided to give this one a try.  I am so glad I finally did!  The story has so many twist and turns you never really know what will happen next!  One minute you love a character and the next minute you think they are trailer trash then you love them again.  A good read!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!  It was a awesome story that had my heart on my sleeve the entire time!  One minute I was laughing, the next minute I was crying!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Unless you have some artistic talent this very hard to draw with a finger. Still it's fun playing with my girls.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|This Dictionary, with the Thesaurus, have yet to let me down. Quick and fairly easy to learn and manage, and has numerous translations and languages available...a sound choice
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A great game. Love the change in places the characters can go. I thought though that it took to many coins to get the special limited character and boards. If the game is redone loaded you lose everything. My grandson reset my kindle to factory setting and I had to restart everything.<br />Love the characters.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|It was so informant and spiritual. I came away with a new understanding if my life and how to approach things in life in a positive way.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I watched this movie and really enjoyed it. I don't even have children and loved it. I got if for my father in-law who is an amazing father to all his children including me. He really enjoyed it as well. Great movie for any dad, family or just someone looking for a good movie. I had fast shipping even in the Christmas season and product packaged well.
0807014273|5.0|I'm still reading the book for the second time there is so much to learn and so much to take on board the help that Logotherapy can give you
B008LFY6NI|4.0|i love this game but it works better on my iphone. other than that it is fun. ok thats it bye!!!!!!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I picked up this book because I wanted to read the book before watching the movie. Needless to say- it is obvious why this book was turned into a movie. It is an incredible story of courage and the will to live. It is an easy read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game Is very interesting and fun. I must warn you though it's highly addictive. This game has never glitches or messed up when I played it. It is fun for everyone to watch and play.
0761169431|4.0|product arrived on time grandson enjoying. Need to get him some larger pieces of oragami paper. he will enjoy greatly
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy watching this series time and time again. The extra things at the end of the last Cd are a lot of fun since you see them nowhere else.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Top action, it was made along the lines of the old movies in that it was a little bit on the emote side, loved it anyway, would recomend it to anyone.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I enjoy watching these episodes. The extra things at the end of the last CD are particularly fun to watch since they are things you don't see on the broadcast
B007REV4YI|5.0|I was my local Costco and scanned the bar code to find that it was slightly cheaper there than #Amazon, so I bought it at Costco. This is beyond question in the top three of all Bond movies, the only others being (insert YOURS here) for me being Goldfinger and Casino Royale (the original). It's determimative of the future of the Bond legend; the previously impervious MI6 and Great Britain are shown to be very human and therefore vulnerable to the monomaniacally perfect personification of evil, Javier Barden, who does not, evidently, have the ability to make a bad film. This is the most human of all the Bond movies; the Bond women in the film are three dimensional, which is as we all know,  is quite an achievement in itself. From a video quality perspective, the BluRay transfer is just perfect. The 5.1 HD mix is excitingly perfect. The extras are great, with Soundtracks from the director , Sam Mendes, and the producers as well as a \\"shooting of Bond\\" featurette and maybe some other stuff I can't remember at the moment. Suffice it to say, get the best price you can (if you care) but this movie is beyond question worth owning and by all means do get it.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Pretty good,  excellent cliff hangers. A must read for teens and people who love drama, mysteries, and romance. Rate 5 stars
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|App does everything I need and is easy to use.<br /><br />I have used this app for month and love it.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|A sweet story with great songs that my little princess loves to sing !  This is going to be a favorite !
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Best book I've read in awhile. The characters are realistic and likable. Took this book on vacation and all I wanted to do was sit in my chair and read! It's emotional - spent the day at the beach crying! Could not put it down.
B009X01FJS|3.0|I really liked this cover when I first received it. Nice color, very functional, looked very sophisticated, etc. Unfortunately, after many days and hours of repeated use and repositioning my Kindle, it broke. I can still use it, but it hangs crooked and it gets annoying. I also don't like that my Kindle seems to be permanently wedged in the case. Once I figure out how to get the Kindle loose, I'll get a new one...<br /><br />Update: Finally got the Kindle out of the broken case today. Now need to find one that will NOT break so easily.
B00138H0H4|5.0|I Love her music, downloaded right to the computer, can't complain about that. Also downloaded both of her newest cd's
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I like this series. It's fun to have Sherlock set in our time. and a female Watson was genius.<br /><br />It reminds me a lot of &#34;House,&#34; though. Only the crabby guy who hates people is smart enough to solve the mystery.  Evidently, I like crabby guys who hate people, because I hope there will be more seasons of this show.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|I have this case for my Fuji HS20EXR, and camera fits perfect. There's some space left for additional small tripod.<br />2 side pockets are perfect for extra batteries. Good quality product.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Fun game that does not ask for money once you're into it.<br /><br />More searches than most games like this and fun games.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This authur is stupendis!  I love the characters and need more from him!  Have read all of his books....  Worth waiting for no need to rush!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|You know how some books you just read because you need something to read?  And every once in a while a book comes along that you want to stop reading for a little bit, just to make it last longer, but you can't, because you can't put it down?  This is one of those books.  It's well-written (and no annoying typos or cringe-making grammar), it's believable, the characters are likeable and three-dimensional, and there's always something to keep you turning the pages.  I really enjoyed this book, thoroughly: enough to even make the effort to write a review.  And no, I don't know the author in any way; I just really, really liked this book.
0767812387|5.0|Love this movie. I've been wanting this on DVD for a very long time. It's great to find it finally.
1416972242|5.0|I read (and thoroughly enjoyed) the first book in the Mortal Instruments series and for the second book I decided to switch to the audio. The story picks up really quickly after the end of City of Bones and sees Clary, Simon, Jace and the other shadowhunters on an adventure to try and stop Clary and Jace's father, Valentine, from stealing all the mortal instruments.<br /><br />I really like the concept of the shadowhunters, the Institute and all the paranormal creatures (vampires, werewolves are aplenty in this series) and since I find YA fantasy so enjoyable, it's easy to see that I really enjoyed City of Ashes.<br /><br />The audio flowed quickly and before I knew it the story was over. With an audio that is over 12 hours long, this isn't a easy feat. Natalie Moore did a really good job as narrator. I particularly liked her voice of Valentine and the fey of the Seelie Court. I really hope she narrates the rest of them, because she made the listening experience really enjoyable.<br /><br />Short of it is I will definitely be picking up the third book in the series sometime soon.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Love the movie, the music, and the voices! Terrific! The clarity of the voices on this CD helped me decide to purchase it over the other recordings.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|About ten years ago I purchased my very first motion sensing battery operated light for the bathroom and loved it! However, I haven't been able to find one quite as nice until now.<br /><br />Taking 4 AA batteries, this light is powerful and very sensitive to motion within a wide range. Since this has settings, off (to save batteries), on, and motion sensing, it is ideal for areas where you can't put up a regular light because of wiring issues, as in there isn't any!<br /><br />We are just finishing testing this (I received a complimentary sample to test and consider for a review), and will be placing it in the bathroom at my daughter's new home which is totally dark, without windows. Once we have power at the house, we will still leave it there since it is perfect for emergencies and just lighting up areas at night.<br /><br />I mentioned that it is sensitive, and it covers a wide range of motion. What we are trying to determine for her use is placement where it will pick up her but not get triggered by the cats.<br /><br />If you are looking for something similar that plugs in, I have also tested the [[ASIN:B00AB3XCFG Hipe Multipurpose 15+5 LED Emergency Power failure Light / Flashlight / Automatic Motion-sensing Night light - 3-in-1 Emergency Hallway Light with a built in Motion and light Sensor]] which uses a rechargeable battery and can be used as an emergency flashlight in addition to being motion sensing. This is the one I am using in the bathroom at my home.<br /><br />Both seem to be well made, and I am pleased to be able to pass on a good recommendation for them.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This is a fun app, and very entertaining.  You can play at different levels or just listen to the music, it's great.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie, as follows-<br />movie - 5 / 5<br />video - 5 / 5<br />audio - 5 / 5<br /><br />great blu ray disc all around. i know that i will be viewing this movie<br />many more times.<br />highly recommended for your collection.<br />can't wait for the other parts of the hobbit to be completed.
B0096HFOZO|5.0|Fond memories from my childhood days. I found this book so hilarious . Would want my son to read this too.
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie, as follows-<br />movie - 4 / 5<br />video - 4 / 5<br />audio - 4 / 5<br /><br />average movie all around, not as great as the hurt locker and<br />i found argo to be a whole lot more entertaining.<br />blu ray quality should have at least been better than it was.<br />guess you should get it if you really really want to.
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|I AM VERY SATISFIED. THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT. I AM ALWAYS WATCHING MOVIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH.HAVE A GREAT DAY.

B00003CXWV|5.0|REALLY GOOD MOVIE. MY HUSBAND LIKED IT, AND WANTED ME TO BUY IT. HE SAID I WOULD LIKE IT, SO I DID, AND I DO LIKE IT. THANK YOU.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I bought this book upon a friends recommendation.  I am glad I did!  Yea the writing might be confusing at times, but it paints a minds eye picture in your head as the story progresses.  I am definitely going to continue reading the whole series, love this style of genre of books!
B001OG3VOQ|5.0|I have loved this album since I was in middle school! If you are an Alanis fan, this is a major album to own! Most people can easily relate to the lyrics on this album, so do yourself a favor and buy it!
B00632HWOG|5.0|easy access to mail at my fingertips with Kindle and on my computer, don't change again though, it is hard to teach old dogs new tricks
B00899DR40|5.0|I love this album, its got all kinds of sounds to it. I'm a mom of two young girls and it is music that we can all listen to! If you are a Justin Bieber fan or have kids who are, I would recommend this album for sure!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The graphics are much improved from the first game.  I find the play more enjoyable.  It does require better hardware than the first one.  If your device is too slow the game is not really playable as the game rates will be too low.  More level changes would make this a better game.
B000NI9UMS|5.0|Had to watch for school and I must say it was very entertaining. The characters were well developed and great at leaving you wanting more.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|The &#34;story&#34; how to get the Americans hiding in the Canadian Embassy out of a very dangerous situation is interesting enough. But no, of course Hollywood has to throw in cheap tricks to keep you on the edge of your seat that was waaaaaay overplayed. Really...the &#34;fake&#34; Hollywood men were kept on the edge of a set due to a picture being shot at the SAME time some Iranian A-hole was calling to verify the movie story? Really? Coz ya kinda lost me there. Oh, sure, Hollywood gets to show off it's edgy chops but it pissed me off. And if that wasn't enough...at the exact same moment, a very young child pieces together the shredded docs to reveal the pic of one of the Americans, rushes it to the Head A-Hole in charge, who within a matter of seconds sends a team out to the Canadian Embassy and then to the airport...the Iranian A-Hole guards are now storming thru the airport and tarmac with blood in their eyes and a vengence while our heroes are sitting nervously and the pilot is calmly announcing the flight ready for departure. All that's left is to cut to the marauding horde of Iranian guards chasing the airplane as it's literally taxi-ing  for takeoff...<br /><br />Oh, wait. That's the very next scene. For all the work they went into to get the details right (the actors look remarkably like the people they're portraying) ya have to go and muck it all up by being Hollywood. Sorry, the ending ruined it.<br /><br />Props to the story, it is a great story but if this was picture of the year...I'm going back to reading books.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Pegasisters unite. This is fun!!! Play this game. It's a great way to pass time. Rarity is the best pony. In my opinion anyway.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|Fun songs to listen to. Wish they had all the songs from the movie and not just the ones on here...
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This was a great game. It could've been longer though. Other than that it was great to play it. I would still recommend it to friends
B005TKD6NY|5.0|This book won't change your life, but it will stay with you in a little dark bittersweet corner of your soul.<br /><br />(Once you finish this book go back and read chapter 1 again)
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This was a great deal, bought them as a Christmas gift for my significant other. Amazing quality, fast shipping, Alien movies for the rest of his life.
0811879542|4.0|I bought this for my 2 year old and she insists we read it several times per day. She loves the interaction and &#34;pressing&#34; different dots. Personally I am sick of pressing yellow dots, but I am not 2....
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought minecraft waz the best thing but man this may be the best thing but I still think that minecraft is amazing and awesome
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun for my daughter.  She likes horses.  It does crash often though on my original Kindle Fire.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love  this  game it is wonderful all of The kids play it everyday I love  it I really would  like the one in Rome.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Great action story about an ex CIA agent that has his daughter kidnapped in Europe.  If you like seeing the good guys kicking the bad guys butts, this is the movie for you.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I haven't downloaded it yet, I was trying to figure it out.  I like no ads. Like to free the birds!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|great actors, great story, great sets, great characters, great scenery, great writing, if you like fantasy this series should appeal to you
B007N85POS|3.0|This was easier to install.  Do not like the ads but had no choice to install it and goes with my Kindle.
B003M6FGTE|4.0|I gave Glee 4 stars because I really do enjoy the musical performances.  The plot and the actors are a bit thin and I definitely would not let my tweens watch the show but when I just want to have something on and it not be deep and involving I do enjoy watching Glee
B007SGM084|5.0|I'm so sad that I have finished this does! I need more! This book seemed a little much for me in the beginning but I couldn't put it down. Please please please write the book through Christians eyes! All I can say is I need more! Now what do I read?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't even begin to explain the loathing I had for the movie because of how glorified the games were,where in the books it dives into by he fact that everyone hates and despises it, this book is amazing and I'm now a die hard fan
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book i ever read but the seires are to expensive.but katniss and gale should be together as a couple
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I really don't watch a lot of tv, and it has taken me awhile to get around to watching this show.<br />So glad I did! It's a beautiful show, even if a bit unbelievable at times!
B004SGWYW4|5.0|This Anime was absolutely amazing! However this is not an anime for someone who is new to the genera. The over powering amount of Fan-service in this Anime may give the wrong impression. however if you enjoy the classic kick ass zombie films and you are a fan of any sort i would highly suggest it. I first watched the series on netflix and after i finished i decided to finally buy it for myself.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|I love this CD, the song's lyrics are very touching and deep. The CD arrived very fast, I did a great choise
B0041QSZJM|5.0|This album covers just about any winter holiday with that distiinctive Pink Martini sound. I especially liked Auld Lang Syne.
B0050KEVO6|1.0|Well, if you play Alchemy on a PC then you will be big time disappointed.  Just not even close as real Alchemy.
B004SIP6BI|5.0|One of Johnny Depp's most memorable movies.  It has a great story line and<br />is just a good movie night entertainment.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|Just not the same as BeJewel Deluxe 3 but close enough that I keep it installed for some playing time to time.
B0035S996U|4.0|&#34;Warriors... Come out and playaaaa&#34; is one of the most memorable lines in movie history. Too bad it comes near the end of a movie with a predictable plot line and bad acting. But, it doesn't matter. This movie is so bad, it's good!  Oh, and the other line worth waiting for: &#34;The chicks are packed.&#34; Can you dig it?
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Absolutely, the best I have found so far.  I am trying Chrome Beta and it seems to be coming out as better but I am still learning.
B005HF0GKC|5.0|I really love the relationship of her and her husband. The family dynamic with kids is a lot of fun to watch.
B004SBULWE|3.0|Yep, I use it a lot and still installed but prefer more control to add items to remove or &#34;kill&#34;.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|It has so much information in. Learning a lot. Use it all the time. Learning more about grammar every day.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|I tried it but just not in with this type of product.  Tried it but then removed it and don't have it installed.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I am still learning how to use it to the best of my advantage. Am interested enough to try to make it work for me. Still having trouble grasping it.
B007W4OZ76|3.0|Well, it is not the best but has some different features and useful as a second explorer for your Kindle.
B000063V8S|5.0|I LOVE Star Trek, The Next Generation and got tired of watching the same episodes over and over on tv so I started ordering all the seasons to watch episodes I want  whenever I choose. I'm up to season 4 (out of 7) so far. I've bought each season through Amazons web site. They were used (lightly worn) and I have only nice things to say about the quality of the discs and prompt mailing. I will be ordering ALL my dvd's through them.
B007RQ6WCA|4.0|Really like this tool and it has a good tutorial and the use is as simple as possible.  Definitely recommend as another cloud tool.
B000063V8R|5.0|I have already ordered the first 2 seasons of 'Star Trek The Next Generation' from Amazon.com. I love 'Star Trek' and am happy to own my own episodes. I have had a good experience dealing with buying used dvd's on their web site. They have been mailed promptly, packaged securely, and the prices are great.
B004EBZX6W|3.0|Sure, it tells you want is going on with your connection and what is available in your location for WiFi.
B004D1CK32|2.0|I love the Magnificent Seven movie with Yul Brenner and Steve McQueen. I know it was based on the Seven Samurai, but you can't beat Yul and Steve when they took the Indian to boot hill.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I play this game late at night to relax and find that it works nicely. &#34;Beauty&#34; has now been added to my pets and every night I tend her, feeding, grooming, cleaning her paddock, mucking out her stall, giving snacks and getting her ready for one or two competitions each night. It is most pleasurable.<br /><br />There are some aspects of the app that are confusing. Perhaps they will become clearer over time, as I play.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|I bought a CPU with HD 4000 graphics specifically so I could build a &#34;Hackintosh&#34; system, which is running OS X on your PC.  This is the very cheapest CPU that's fully supported with its onboard graphics. I ended up getting an add-in video card, but it's nice to have this to fall back on.<br /><br />It's a dual-core CPU at 3.3GHz.  Intel's CPUs are generally faster on the &#34;CPU&#34; part and a little slower on the &#34;GPU&#34; part compared to AMD's Trinity.  This is roughly the same price as an A10-5800K, which can be overclocked, but it uses more power even at stock speeds.  Also, for my specific purpose I needed to go with an Intel CPU.  It's a great performer, and it handles everything I throw at it in games like Starcraft II and Diablo III, and in sound apps like Pro Tools Express.
B002361MLA|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. I strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to change their lives for the better.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Big time waster but lots of fun. Recommended by a friend who didn't warn me about how addicting this game is.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|How can a show set in the early 1900s in England be so riveting?  I can't explain it, but it is just that.  Once you start watching you can't stop!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun app. It is buggy though. It often doesn't load on my kindle fire without restarting it. I like the realistic motion of the horse. my kids like doing the work tasks. it is possible to play without spending money, many items can be purchased with coins you can earn, and they offer more difficult challenges to obtain gems to purchase other items in the game. overall very enjoyable game.
1592537251|5.0|Wonderful sketches with many tips that motivated me to buy a &#34;moleskine&#34; and join The Urban Sketchers in Brazil where I live, and make a sketch a day. Come on, move on with me: forget the rules that restrain you, take a pencil or a permanent marker and put aside your shame and be happier. Good luck.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you can't find the controls then go to minecraftwiki.net. It has all the information in the game and for the blocks. It helped me alot for the game, letting me into a head-start. If you cannot find controls go to minecraftwiki.net and search for &quot; pe controls&quot; to know what to do. Ok so peace off.<br /><br />P.S. Almost all games are behind in updates.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|The plot was good, denzel acted as usual but the nudity and language wasn't necessary plus it seemed to glorify drug use. I could have saved $5.99.
B008JOLG7U|4.0|Definitely something to dance to. I was never a big JLo fan, but this collection of songs was a winner.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|IMHO the best American original children's animated feature film to come out in years. A simplified \\"Tron\\" like story of the caliber of Up, Wall-E, and especially How to Train Your Dragon / Despicable Me. Cute, very cute and plenty for both kids and parents alike. How can you not feel sorry for Ralph who after 30 years is tired of \\"being the bad guy\\" or the otherwise cute little girl he meets who everybody says is \\"nothing but a glitch\\" ...
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno brings it in this album showcasing his voice and talent. Great songs from slow to quick with excellent beats.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wanted to read the book before I saw the movie.  This was a fast, easy read.  I couldn't put it down.
B0037NVM1I|4.0|You may need to have grown up in the 90s to truly appreciate this film, but in my opinion, it's one of the greatest films of it's time. You're not going to find much to appreciate about this film on an intellectual level. Sure the running theme of &#34;No fate but what we make&#34; raises it slightly above the average action film, at it's core, this movie is just big dumb science fiction action, of an ilk they don't really make anymore.<br /><br />The T-1000, a brawny emotionless cyborg from the future, is the role that Arnold was born to play, and he reprises it perfectly while adding some subtle additions to the character. Sadly this was the peak of his career before entering his role as the governor of California and is now probably too old to be a major player in the action genre. Linda Hamilton is also amazing here. No longer the meek victim of the first movie, her character Sarah Connor has clearly been driven nearly insane by the revelations of the last movie and a desperate need to prepare her son for his future role as humanity's savior.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put it down! The characters will stay with you after this story. Very moving! I couldn't wait to see how it all ended!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Here again I find myself reviewing a great series that was panned by the multitudes.  I am at a loss for what the mass considers entertainment.  This show was intelligent, witty, and filled with action.  What a great SPACE COWBOY SHOW!!  Each character filled their own special niche perfectly.  Once again, I fail to see what main stream considers good.  We can only hope that one day the good things in life will be recognized.
B004GFN11A|4.0|I would like to be able to upload photos...even on the iphone app. But otherwise,  it is a fine/enough app.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|When This 1'st cameout on MTV it was one of the BEST shows and STILL is!! It takes me back to when MTV had REAL TV not this Crap they show now, We could all use a little Daria her witty and dark wisdom knows no bounds!!
0521675804|5.0|This is a fantastic book to start learning English grammar with. I've struggled with the english grammar for many years, and finally I started to understand it when I came across this book. This book makes learning grammar joyful.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read this account in one sitting. This is a first hand account of the mission to find and eliminate Sadam.  I have read several of the accounts of this mission that have been published in recent years but this one is the best.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I was a late-comer to Modern Family, but once I started watching the show during the regular season, I couldn't get enough and bought the first 3 seasons. Season 3 was no exception in terms of the laugh factor. It is FANTASTIC! I watched the whole season in one weekend and laughed all the way! The extras are also a real treat. Can't wait to get Season 4. :)  The item was priced reasonably, arrived on time and was in pristine condition (new).
B007HACDLK|4.0|It is hard to describe why I find Flynn's books such good reads. I know they are formulaic but you can't beat the action and suspense. You also have to love the fact that in Flynn's books the protagonist doesn't get mad , he gets even.  i guess it is catharticz to have the terrorist get theirs since in real life we often don't get that satisfaction.
B001I8A76A|5.0|Deserves even more stars! Every song is great...Pink is a master songwriter and this album is one of her best. Buy it now!
B005GHN2GG|5.0|This story is so eerie and whimsical at the same time. It almost has a dark fairy tale feel to it. Recommended.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|The only reason I got the sample for my kindle was because it had good reviews and it was less than $3. Finished the sample in one sitting and just had to read the rest. Brilliant book. Highly recommend if your into medieval type fantasy. Intrigue, mystery, magic and big scale battles in the latter half. Waiting eagerly for the next book.
B0026YWQ4Q|5.0|I really liked most parts of the movie, but it left out important parts of the book. Though I know they cant put everything that the book had into the movie, I was slightly disappointed that they didn't. Still a great movie, but read the books, then see the movie. You'll see the difference. Loved the actors and how they portrayed the characters! To me that was excellent.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I got it for my kindle. It took me two days to finish. It is definitely the best book in the trilogy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I just said cool &amp; AWESOME and I love pizza with all my hart &lt;3. (: (; I am AWESOME also and amazing ends with zing
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was good but I can't read it bc I can't unless I do this thing so can I read.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Liked all the Bond movies ,this one seemed a little slow at times seems like it went back to basics Just different hard to put finger on it .Watched it twice liked it but........?
B005K17RU0|4.0|app navigates ok, sometime freezes for a bit but normally works fine.  ads are not intrusive and the loading page contains the majority of info i need at a glance.  switching locations could be easier but for a free app, im not complaining.  try it out!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I have to admit that I have not yet watched this particular DVD.  At the same time I have seen all of season 5 episodes in prime time and, I have seen them again when they have been rerun.  I have watched the DVD for Season 1, 2, and I am part way through Season 3.  One thing you will appreciate is watching the shows without the commercial interruption.  You will also get the &#34;complete&#34; version on DVD compared to watching late night reruns on TV.  The DVD extras are an added bonus.  I had mentioned in a previous review that I identify somewhat with a bunch of professors who have a love (obsession) with popular culture.  In my day we taught Shakespeare and Chaucer, but we also went to conferences on Tolkien.  Incidentally the portrayal of academic politics and academic pettiness in some of the story lines seems to me to be pretty accurate.  All the characters are good for a laugh, but the best part to me is when Penny (the woman who is a few credits short of a community college degree) and Dr. Sheldon Cooper (who considers himself the smartest person in the world) interact.  Sometimes sparks will fly, and sometimes there are extraordinary moments.  Consider Penny and Sheldon doing &#34;Soft Kitty&#34; as a round.
B008OOYALE|4.0|It's pretty fun just wish you could make money faster to build you town faster than you can right now.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Typical of all the Angry Birds games.  Got it to use as a way to pass time.  Has pretty decent challenges and the price is right.  The ads are unobtrusive, generally.  Occasional pop up in the middle of a shot though.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Boys movie :) ...so don't try to watch it with a girl...they won't understand it.<br /><br />So many action and i like it...short and quick
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is caught me in a way not many book have.  It was as if I was really watching from above.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This series brings British history and it's class system to life.  It's nice to be able to watch it in small segments when we have the time. Will watch all seasons available.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great series on the changes in the way of life for the aristocracy and servants during WW I in England. Excellent series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is basically a diffrent  version of temple run. but it might be even a little bit funner. you can collect a bunch of coins and use them to buy your accessories for the game and looks if you've ever played temple run then this is the game for you. and here's the cool thing its free so get it nnnooowww
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was great.  It remined me of the Fifty shades series, but not as violent.  I couldn't put it down.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book beyond belief it was amazing and I highly recommended it to all young adults. It was very intriguing. I could not put it down.
B00846REIS|5.0|Excellent romance novel.  I could transport myself into the book.  I didn't want to put it down.  The book was a great read.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|I love Jane Austen but this isn't one of my favorites. I thought it moved very slowly, almost painfully so.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The series was getting a little boring until the last installment (#12 clear) then they brought it back to resemble what it was in the beginning.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Love the book. Yay us us us us a ya us. Swords death. Roman greek . Super cool. Analyzing stuff
B004AR4WVM|4.0|I am old school and prefer vinyl to CD's. So glad they are available again. I have no complaints at all. Amazon does it again.
B0083VIWSA|5.0|Eddie Hazel and George Clinton are virtuosos. Clinton's recognition of what he had with Maggot Brain, and his genius in engineering it as he did, well, the only achievement more remarkable is how Mr. Hazel played.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game has me hooked. I never understood how people could get so caught up in a game until I started playing my horse.  I spend way too much time on it, but I just can't put it down.<br />.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Addicted to Mahjongg games so, of course, my first game added to my Kindle Fire HD had to be Mahjong Deluxe HD.  It plays well like any on my pc.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Batteries work exactly as they should, very happy with my purchase.  Very convenient multi-pack for easy replacement.  Great value!  A+++!!!
B0094K1K42|2.0|We only got aBout 20 minutes into this movie. It is slow and not very interesting. I would or watch it.
B009P13RQY|5.0|If you like their other albums, then this should be right up your alley. More produced, but still heavy grooves.
B008M87GJK|4.0|GOOD APP  Gives me have a quick view of interesting stories from around the world, not just the scrap that passes for news in the US.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I was looking for a drama filled show to replace desperate housewives.  I was not disappointed.  Don't expect anything too deep
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I've only watched the 'background' DVD so far, and enjoyed the history. When I get more time, I'll watch more and update the review.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I have not previously read Stephen King due to the fact that I generally perceived his writing to be heavy on the &#34;horror&#34; scale. This book is not of that genre, so I gave it a try based on a recommendation by two individuals whom I respect.<br />The book deals with with what I describe as the &#34;fantastical&#34; in that the protagonist uses time travel to go back to the 1960s and attempts to change history. I found the book to be &#34;stretched&#34; by the author in that the excessive detail made the book much longer than needed to tell the story. In addition, what appeared to be a good premise devolved as I read the book and ultimately, for me, became boring and repetitious.
0385338910|3.0|This book was just okay. I loved This is Where I Leave You by the same author. This one is pretty forgettable. The main character is sort of whiny and spends a lot of time feeling sorry for himself. I wouldn't buy this book again. Save your money and just go to the library and borrow it if you must read it. Or read This is Where I Leave You - it is a funnier and more interesting version of family dynamics, death and grief. Skip this one.
B0084I9QLY|5.0|I would definitely recommend this to any MJ Fan!!!! It's a beautiful keepsake. I have it framed for everyone to see!!!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|any one who wants to change their way of thinking, their way of life and they way they want to actually live in &#34;this world&#34;, should read this book!<br />It shows the &#34;where&#34;, &#34;how&#34; and &#34;why&#34; gratitude should be practiced every single day!<br />Because without that gratitude in your life, you will not accomplish any of your wishes or dreams!<br />be grateful and say &#34;thank you&#34; !!!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|it is pretty fun to play this. the app is free but u end up spending money on it by purchasing things
1451695195|5.0|A must read book.  Really enjoyed it. Once you get into, it is hard to put it down, keeps you setting on the edge of you chair.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|its a good product and works well show up as when they said it would my grandmother says it really help her
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the best books I've eve read.  Even though it was a long book, I couldn't put it down.
B007NU54H4|5.0|THIS WAS A GIFT FOR GRAND DAUGHTER. SHE HAS THE COLLECTION. VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT AND PRICE. WAS SHIPPED FAST.
B00B92ZO3G|5.0|The 30 minute express series distills the main points of the book into easily consumable and succinct points.  Easy to read and understand.<br /><br />Pink makes great points about the changing nature of sales, and how everyone is in some form of sales, so embrace that and become good at it instead of rejecting the most natural part of our professional lives.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This movie really scared the crap out of me when I saw it in theaters. It made me have this general uneasy feeling throughout and really get into it. It is more of a classic horror movie with a lot of suspense. The soundtrack is amazing and adds to the creepiness. Just when you thought it was a good movie at the end, a twist happens that just bumps up the creepiness factor up to the top. I was genuinely disturbed after watching this movie.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|It's based on a true story, not a true story. So if you're familiar with the story and the events and focus on what they portrayed differently, you won't enjoy it. But the acting and directing were great. I knew the story and I was still at the edge of my seat. That could've been the effect of the wine. But I enjoyed the movie.
B0037A4ILC|4.0|Dear Amazon;  When i bought this movie i thought it would come with english language and it did not, but it was a Great Movie.<br />Maybe next time i should pay more attention to all the info. on it.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It took a while to get immersed in this book but once I did it was very good. Be patient and you will come to enjoy this too.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|I really enjoyed this, being a neuroscientist myself, it included enough scientific background to keep me interested.  I think he has done an amazing job.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|I had to uninstall this app. It wasnt what I thought it would be .it didnt play well on my kindle. Maybe I didnt give it time
B003AVPV1O|5.0|The item was delivered very fast and in good condition. I have been able to connect my TV to the desktop and can watch streaming movies without disconnecting cables.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I absolutely love the show.  Unfortunately it was cancelled.  It always seems to be my luck that I do not discover a good show while it is still on the air.  I rarely have time for television, and most of the entertainment I get is from what is available on Amazon or Netflix.  I really wish they could renew the show, although it probably would not be the same without the same cast.  I love all of the characters and the actors were all very good.

B00821OX98|5.0|If you take your entertainment too seriously, and look for realism in everything, this may not be for you.  It is however a good story and I believe well acted.  I am looking forward the a new season.
B004PGO25O|5.0|Do the Work is a quick and easy read...but if you fly through it with a goal of &#34;reading a book&#34; you will have missed all the nuggets tucked into each page. I think I have more words highlighted than are not highlighted. I think many of us need permission to start, finish, fail, and start again, but we may not know we need it. Do the Work provides the swift kick in the backside that I needed to move forward. If you are stuck, don't know what to do next, procrastinator, excuse-filled, too busy, then buy this book. NOW!!! Don't hesitate.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This is very well crafted and beautifully researched book that not only explains the differences between introverts and extroverts but also puts those differences into relevant social context and presents the most reliable research on the topic.  The best thing about it is that it makes a very clear distinction between being an introvert and having social anxiety disorder or a host of other quasi-diagnoses.  The author also shares her own experiences of being an introvert in the decidedly extroverted world of Wall Street law firm.<br /><br />It's not only a great read but I think it is one of the most important books I've read in several years as it points out the flaws inherent in a culture and educational system that puts so much emphasis on interaction and so little on thought and contemplation.  I think Ms. Cain has started a revolution.....a quiet one.

0316069884|4.0|Was recommended to me by a friend, didn't know what to expect. I could relate to it very easily. Very informative, educational and at times absolutely shocking! I finished the book in less than a week! It has influenced my eating, lifestyle and mind set!! Do read it!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a blast to play. Found it while I was in the hospital and could'nt stop playing it.
B001AW156U|5.0|I really like these when playing shooters, they help keep your grip when aiming and are lightweight so they don't add too much to the controller.
0316228532|5.0|I had to make a list of the characters in order to recall who everybody was.  Other than that little criticism, I loved the book.  She is a very talented writer with excellent character development.  It has nothing to do with the HP books and I didn't expect it to.<br /><br />None of the characters were very noble, sad to say, but they were interesting and kept the plot tooling along nicely.<br /><br />I got the book out of the library.  You might want to do that, too.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I've listened to the the thunderstorm one the most. It is so soothing and actually sounds like a thunderstorm is going on outside.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|good match 3.. wish had a little more to it.. puzzles etc.. medium challenge... medium length.. should be. $.99 would have been 5 stars
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I've been trying to find a good sudoku game for my kindle and this was a free app the other day and I downloaded it. It wasn't too hard to figure out which was nice. And what I mean by this is that all sudoku apps have their way of operating the app and this was easy to pick up.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|This race is real and we need to stay in. Man-machine is the win combination. We need to learn faster than ever in order to keep in team with machines.
0800177363|5.0|I watched this film for a Psychology Class in College and it is a wonderful story of an unexplained disorder that plagues a group of elderly patients. A wonderful role by Robin Williams.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Good read, characters engaging but a very short story for the money. Perhaps I am not used to reading graphic novels but I think you should get more volumes with each purchase.
