B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the first book in the Hunger Games series I felt like I had PTSD. The second book in the Hunger Games series is no different. While more complex than the first, with more depth to the plot and characters, it remains focused on surviving in the face of unspeakable evil. The author speaks with authority on this subject. However traumatic the world Ms. Collins brings us into, we cannot leave until we know the fate of the characters who have become too real and too compelling to abandon.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its grate all it needs are some updates to add quite a few things and it'll be as good as the first stages as the PC version
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very interesting history, great characters.<br /><br />Good mix of darkness and happiness, I finished the book in few days.<br /><br />Already bought the sequel, lets hope it is as good as the 1st.

B0088WGBC8|1.0|Didn't get to finishing watching this movie because it kept freezing up every twenty minutes! It's a good movie went to see it in theaters but horrible horrible on amazon
B0008ENICU|5.0|This movie is a riot! You'll want to watch it over and over just to catch all of the witty (and catty!) comments! I love it! There was a remake done a few years ago, which was also good, but can in no way compare to these women in the original!!!
B005LAII1C|5.0|I loved this film when i went with the wife to see it. We both laughed the whole way through.  These people here who rate it anything less than 5 stars must be your basic religious types, or people who don't have a clue about life! Can't wait till dec 11 to nab a copy.
B00782O7IY|5.0|This DVD was enjoyable to watch, especialy since it was a silent film with captions.  Great facial exprssions and body language!!

1595828095|4.0|This volume collects all of Wrightson's output for Warren's Creepy and Eerie magazines. It includes the expected classics like \\"Jenifer,\\" \\"The Black Cat,\\" and \\"The Pepper Lake Monster.\\" It also contains three collaborations, perhaps only known to Wrightson or Warren competionists: \\"Country Pie\\" and \\"Dick Swift and His Electric Power Ring\\" (both art collaborations with Carmine Infantino) and his due with Howard Chakin: \\"Reuben Youngblood: Private Eye!\\" A nice aside in Bruce Jones' introduction concerns Wrightson and Louise Jones kindness to Infantino after he had been fired by DC.<br /><br />The reproduction of the stories is adequate, (of course I for one have been spoiled by IDW's Artist's Editions) but I understand the logistical issues of corralling all that original art and getting high-quality reproductions of it. The book is printed on heavy, bright white paper which holds and shows of the blacks very well. Which does bring to mind the more major of my two quibbles with this book. This book thoughtfully includes all of Bernie's introductory pages of the hosts Uncle Creepy and Cousin Eerie. While most of them appear to have been done in glorious black and white, sometimes in the original Warren magazines the were overlaid with a second color that really did nothing to add to the presentation of the artwork. Those same second colors are reprinted in this volume, I can't understand why they didn't print them in black and white, I really think they could have dropped those colors out. It also reprints Wrightson's \\"Nightfall\\" back cover for Eerie #60 and his \\"Gentleman of Adventures Wear Arrow Collars\\" that used as the cover for the all reprint issue of Creepy #113. But both these covers are reprinted with all the logos and type and everything plastered on them. And oh my god, \\"The Muck Monster\\" reprinted in color. No. Thank. You. This might seem like minor points, but with this book collecting one of the greatest comic artists of the last 40 years at arguably theheight of his powers, it could have been perfect and in my opinion Dark Horse dropped the ball with these presentation issues.<br /><br />However, it is wonderful to have all this superlative work between hard covers, and I'm glad it was published and I was very happy to spend my money on it. If you're Wrightson fan and somehow missed this, go buy it now. If you like horror stories and superior narrative art, go buy it now. I hadn't read \\"Jenifer\\" for awhile, and forgot how twisted that story really is. Here you also have Wrightson adapting Poe, Lovecraft, and illustrating his own scripts and some of Bruce Jones' best. This is an essential volume for any student of sequential art.
0618871713|2.0|As someone who had read and appreciated DTWOF, and after having read many positive reviews, I had high expectations for Fun Home.<br /><br />Alas, I had the same feelings as when I watched the Richard Pryor's special after he recovered from burning himself while freebasing.  That is, the material should have been locked up with all the other notes from private sessions with the author's psychologist.  What is our role as the observer participant in these presentations?  Are we an appreciative audience viewing a higher art form or merely a passive therapeutic tool used for a feeble attempt at catharsis?  Does our participation serve to soothe the author's lost soul or merely negate the requirement that the author face their demons in the privacy of their own self-generated and self-imposed hell?<br /><br />The question remains, if you appreciate this book, is it because you have rationalizations to make of your own?  Only you can determine your validity in the world, neither story nor audience can diminish your responsibilities or vicariously provide for your atonement.  With all sincerity, I wish you safe travels and good luck!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is one of the best movies if all time. And it comes with a ton of bonus disks including digital copy, blue ray, blue ray 3d and dvd. Greaf deal
0316228532|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book, but as I kept reading, I kept thinking, it's got to get better...it never did.  J.K. Rowlings' Harry Potter series was so well written, clever and insightful.  This book is just diappointing--there is more dysfunction than a Real Housewives show---I kept reading just to be able to say that I'd read it all the way through--and secretly hoped there would be a better storyline as I read.  J.K. Rowling should stick to what she does best---this isn't her finest hour.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|This album is one of the most amazing albums I have heard in years.  Yes, Bob's voice is now harsh and sounds like it has been crossed with Louis Armstrong's.  So what?  His voice fits these songs perfectly.  I won't try to rehash all of the individual songs here, this has been done well by others, with one exception.  Reviewers keep discussing \\"Duquesne Whistle\\" as a 'country' song.  I'm sorry, but it just isn't.  It has a New Orleans' jazz/blues sound.  I thought so the first time I heard it, and I've played it for several friends who all agree.  With that out of the way, I'll move on.  This album can be upbeat or sad.  Depressing or incredibly dark. It's been a long time since I've actually enjoyed hearing about a lover's triangle in which all three end-up dead.  But, Bob carries this off with his brilliant poetic flair.  I had read how the title cut, \\"Tempest\\" was too long.  I disagree.  I found his telling of the tragedy of the Titanic to be breathtaking.  This ballad is reminiscent of the folk ballads of a hundred years ago.  As noted in other reviews, Bob employees a wide variety of musical styles that all fit well in this album.  Great job, Mr. Dylan.  Thanks, again, for continuing to astound us all.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|[[ASIN:B004XUMPFQ Serenity [HD]]][[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]]I had not heard of the Firefly series (yes, I must live in a vacuum) before it was recommended to me by some friends to whom I shall forever be indebted. So I bought the series, and then the movie Serenity, (from Amazon of course) and watched it on my laptop.<br />To say that I was blown away would be an understatement! I must be careful here, because I have seen other films and TV series that I thought far surpassed anything I'd ever seen before (Mash, X Files, Lonesome Dove, and others come to mind) and it's hard to drop one of those from my list of permanent favorites, but I came close to replacing them all with Serenity and Firefly. The writing was powerful, the casting superb, and I was caught up in the sheer passion that Joss and his crew obviously felt for this calling.<br />So no, it did NOT \\"replace\\" all my other favorites, it forged a new category in my mind, that embraced all of the others into one \\"Holy Grail\\" from which I refresh myself from time to time.<br />I'll be watching it again soon, and I do not think I'll be changing my mind about it at all!
1439170916|5.0|A family member of mine was recently diagnosed with cancer, and since I am a knowledge junkie, I hopped right online to see what I could find to read on the subject.  Emperor of All Maladies was a perfect mix of technical science writing and human interest.  I have learned so much and got answers to questions that I didn't even know I had.  I now feel much more comfortable discussing treatment options. An excellent read.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|i got the discs in and they were in perfect condition, could see myself in the reflection zero scratches and played perfect.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Who doesn't love JK Rowling?  I have no joy in criticizing her work here, but I think this is a book that tried too hard to reflect something the author wasn't.  I think Rowlings had in mind to craft a comedy like \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\" but didn't digest it enough for the end result to go in as \\"in-your-face disgusting human behavior\\" and come out as art.  It was all just too raw.  Why so raw?  She is skilled enough to write a \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\" type book.  But this one makes me think of the ingenue actress who spends years on the big screen becoming the world's sweetheart and then decides she wants to be known for deeper work, but rather than doing deeper work she bares her breasts on screen.  I always feel a little embarrassed for her when she does that.<br /><br />All artists should push themselves to evolve.  I hope this book is just one perhaps unsteady step to a more more mature J.K.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Wife and me wanted to see at the movies but alas there were alot of movies to see so we waited on this one till it came out on blueray..was a very nice experience and we both loved the movie and expect to see more maybe about this movie series.<br /><br />I will not give away any info except that it does start it all but leaves room for more prequels and or new directions for the future and we will see what comes next.<br /><br />Acting great<br /><br />some stuff proves you can still be stupid but be an engineer..talking to alien thing that snaps at you.....idiot, learn to run away live for sequel.<br /><br />the visuals were outstanding and the spaceship was believable.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|overall very useful kind of attracting though when you plug your charger in the app feels as if it needs to open up automatically.
B0091REZMW|3.0|i enjoy hidden object games and although this is a good game. it seems to easy to find the items. i wouldn't pay for this game.
B002TVBU1Q|5.0|Excelente edicion del box de  lujo de Abbey Road que incluye un poster y una remera de buena calidad , y uno de los mejores vinilos de The Beatles, por lo menos para mi, infaltable para cualquier coleccionista de discos.<br />.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Would love to see this on the screen. It was a really good book. Can not wait until Shades of Chriatian comes out. To be able to hear his side. His feelings towards the whole thing. Love it.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked the 50 Shades trilogy, you will like this book.  It's actually a copycat of 50 Shades, but I loved it anyway. There are two more books in the series. One just came out and I am reading it now and there is another one coming.
B00007E7K0|5.0|I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews that I might have issues with this staying on my lens.  So far so good.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is an excellent app fir Pinteredt on Kindle. I was using Pinstar before end wad shocked at how much I was missing out. Pinterest is great. I highly recommend it.
B004EQAVHI|4.0|\\"Never Let Me Go\\" is not a movie for casual afternoon viewing -- its premise is so grotesque that most viewers will benefit from being in the proper frame of mind before watching.  This poignant film has one terrible premise:  in an alternate near future, most citizens in Britain live very long lives because the nation raises children whose sole purpose in life is to act as organ donors for the rest of society.  These donors are raised in a boarding school environment and at first are not told of their ghastly fates; they are only told that they need to stay \\"healthy.\\"  Eventually they learn that their common fate is to make, on average, four organ \\"donations\\" when in their early twenties, the fourth of which, on average, will be fatal. This is their fate from birth and it is inflexible. The entire weight of society is behind this grisly arrangement, and more than anything else, what bothered me about this film was the way it showed the young donors' acceptance of society's dictate regarding their fates.  Not to mention society's pragmatic justification of it.<br /><br />I am not sure that I would call this film an entirely enjoyable viewing experience, but it is an unforgettable one.  RJB.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.... the plot and the graphics was well done... the action was ok... but witch coming out of white milk and out black tar feathers was well done...<br />Thank you for the fast delivery too....
B008J34466|5.0|OMG!!!!  This CD was totally AWSOME!!!! I have played it like a million times and still counting. This is one of PINK'S best CD's. Even though she may have had a baby, she still puts an up in your face, and I don't give a s*#t attitude, CD out there for all her fans. She hasn't toned it down at all. ( Thank Godness) I LOVE IT!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love these games!!! these games help me pass the time &amp; I could play all day!!! my daughter will love these games also when she gets older.
B000004286|5.0|I was really happy to receive the soundtrack in original packaging.  The product was new, as promised.  This is my favorite soundtrack.  Braveheart forever!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love the way the book ends and leave you hanging for the next book!  You can see how much they grew and matured as the story progressed~  Loved it~!
0062082353|5.0|Chris paints an intriguing mural of the war on terror and the hardships and realities he and his fellow servicemen and women face. Thanks Chris for the insight and your unselfish service and sacrifices.<br />I highly recommend this book!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|like the changes it makes as the characters mature and open up to the other.  Its a good book, with creativity that might interest you to try at home too!  I am looking forward to Book 3.  You will too!
B0091REZMW|2.0|It's probably a very nice game but I've soooo tired of hidden object games. They are not a challenge, just boring and tedious with no mental challenge. I'm sure they are much easier to create than the games with intricate puzzles and plot lines. I didn't realize that Mystery Manor was primarily an HO game until I started playing it. If you like HO games, enjoy.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Fantastic special effects don't always impress me, but a good story does. THE TOURIST has an excellent, beautifully crafted story that's deeper than a surface viewing reveals. This script holds up under repeated watches and close scrutiny. I recommend it to everyone who loves good story-telling. The views of Venice don't hurt, either.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|intense...exciting...intriguing....the kind of book you cannot leave it out of your hands until you've finished it and want more....<br /><br />i recommend it to anyone!!!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|For a match 3 game, this is one of the best I've tried. Nothing revolutionary, but the graphics and gameplay are solid.
B005VNOPDO|5.0|Excellent casting on this show.  I enjoy the character and story development on the series and have enjoyed it from Season 1 Episode 1 to the newest Season 4 just starting on TV.  I can't wait to see what happens next.
B007TK77QE|2.0|After having been thrilled by 6 large Harry Potter volumes, I bought the book the first day expecting a similar experience. I fought through the first 80 pages of the new book. I found it boring and I gave up. I will give it another try at some later time.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the storyline . The games are good. Looking forward to part 2! Hopefully they will carry on the mystery in the same manner (some sequels are a let down) .
B004LUS390|2.0|App crashes when trying to import pic from gallery, at least since 1.4.0.  And Vic is right, UI is not in intuitive.  I guess it's just good for new drawings by hand.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Nice graphics, challenging, fun, and a great twist on the old match 3 style of games. I would recommend this game.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Comic book fan from way... way... back.  This movie met nearly all of my expectations for these heroes.  The franchise appears to be in good hands, I hope the actors hang in there for a few (dozen) more.
B006PAZMMK|1.0|I actually expected more. Music Was not as great like the song Cinema. Whats the deal with the last song? Did not fit in right with the album. Need more songs as well.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I loved playing this game on my ipad. Now I can take it to go on my Galaxy Nexus. Beautiful graphics and exciting game play. Warning, it's hard to put down once you start playing it!
0345803493|5.0|This was my favorite book of the series.  You get into more of the perplexities of the Mr.Grey and Ana relationship.
B007TK77QE|5.0|This was a fabulous read - while I havent read the Potter series I now understand why she is considered one of this century`s great writers.  The development of the characters combined with the ability to make you like them one moment, feel sorry for them the next moment and then hate them a second later is a rare gift in writing. Her ability to weave so many stories yet keep the plot tight is also very good. From memory I think I was told it was light hearted comedy - dont be fooled by this description - yes there are some laughs but Rowling isnt afraid to go to some very dark places yet manages to leave you feeling uplifted and retain your faith in the human race.
0345803485|5.0|Great start of the series.  Really  liking the main characters.  Great Supporting cast as well.  Very unexpected ending that makes you want to start reading book 2 in the series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I reserve 5 stars for books that (in some way) just blew my mind. (Notice that this one earned 5 stars).<br />I own the Kindle version and two copies of the paperback (one for marking up).<br /><br />I am actually 'afraid' of Dystopian fiction: the world seems so 'dystopian' itself sometimes that just reading the news is enough to get a fix, but after a year of resisting, I read it. One and a half days to finish.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />So much has already been written, I'll try to say something different.<br />Firstly, this author knows how to write a book: structurally and efficiently. She pulls no punches, there is no waffling on and the layers are subtle and deep.<br />If inclined, this book can lead to long, late-night discussions on the role of reality-tv, modern China's role in world commerce and the  age-old relationship of rich vs. poor / first world vs. third world and even how America has become more stratified in the early 21st Century. I'm sure I missed some topics.<br /><br />There are some people who have heard of the book and are horrified that a novel \\"would condone teenagers killing each other\\". Yeah. Like Harry Potter \\"condones the worship of 'the Dark Arts'\\".<br />In both cases, these people have not read the books that they are commenting on.<br /><br />Now, that said, KNOW your teenager. Some could handle this at 14, some only at 19. Choose wisely, but even more importantly, read it yourself first: it may be in the \\"Young adult\\" section, but this book is not juvenile in any way.
0345803507|4.0|Good book.  I just felt It was written fast for a deadline.  There was some parts I was disappointed that we didn't get to read the whole details coming up to them.  But still a must read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book has every emotion a woman can feel: pleasure, love, grief, and yes horror. i loved every minute of this book with the exception of Mr. Grey‘s need for punishment. That was the only art of this book that honestly had me uncomfortable
B00127RAJY|4.0|Okay, so I absolutely love Jillian and her style of teaching/pushing you to put 150% of your effort into a workout. Like she says in the video many times, you cannot do a 28 minute workout and go half-ass. I love how she understands that it's difficult and doesn't make it seem like its so easy for everyone to do. After the first day of level one I was so sore and shaky that I could hardly walk up the stairs and had to take a break for 3 days. I felt amazing after doing level one for 10 days straight though, about 10 pounds down (I also did 1.5 at the gym daily). So on my first day of level two, I was about 5 minutes into it and *CRACK* my ankle snapped. I was SO bummed because I was making such great progress but here I am, on bed rest, and not able to put any weight on my ankle. My doctor told me no exercising for 8-10 weeks (guess ill be starting out on level 1 of Jillian when I return!). Although I don't blame Jillian for my ankle breaking, I see that many other people felt joint pain and knee pain so I would hope that she could work In exercises not so hard on the bones! In the videos she says \\"I want no injuries here...\\" But I've read about quite a few! Bottom line- you must try this video! Just be sure that you move on when you are ready and don't push yourself to the point of injury.
B005JCT4B0|3.0|Soft shell cases are no good. Expected a heck of a lot better quality. Sound quality wasn't bad though. It is what it is I guess.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|I realize that a lot of people prefer to \\"wait for the covers,\\" that is, they just can't get past Bob's non-pop-oriented vocals. I can understand that, but I would urge the more open-minded folks to give this CD a few hearings. It tends to grow on you. Track-by-track (your results may vary): 1) Duquesne Whistle -- harmless, jaunty opener; 2) Soon After Midnight -- solid Dylan song; 3) Narrow Way -- above-average Dylan song, therefore, WAY above-average by common standards; 4) Long and Wasted Years -- superb Dylan song, reminiscent of \\"Brownsville Girl\\", but a lot shorter; this is a heart-breaker. with a heartbreaking final couplet: \\"So much for tears/So much for these long and wasted years.\\" 5) Pay in Blood -- dark, but with a sly tag-line: \\"I pay in blood/But not my own.\\" 6) Scarlet Town -- OK, but not one I would listen to again and again. 7) Early Roman Kings -- a classic Dylan song, probably the signature song of this CD, though not the title song. 8) Tin Angel -- OK, but kind of a space-filler; I'm not into the pseudo 17th-century ballad style. 9) Tempest -- not quite what was intended, I think; ponderous and kind of a one-idea, predictable song; unfortunately in 3/4 time, which makes it more ponderous. 10) Roll on, John -- It's really, really hard to do a good tribute song, and many tributes are painfully cheesy. This tribute, to John Lennon, is exceptional. It combines intense specificity to John Lennon's life and expansive generality to anyone who's ever lost a close friend or an admired hero. Oddly, it reminds me of \\"I and I\\" in the way it combines concrete details with almost philosophical or religious abstraction. It is a tribute both to Lennon and to Dylan's artistry.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like the format of this game better than the other free mahjong games but ever since it updated I get an ad for different games before every scoring, very annoying.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game may be challenging at times but it is really fun too I I I I like this game
B0086700CM|5.0|it requires quick reflexes and anticipation.  a player must develop a strategy to maximize the score. sometimes low hanging fruit is tempting but can get you in trouble. excellent game.
1402760663|4.0|This is an excellant book written from the Indain's view.  To many times the old tome \\"The Victor gets to write the History\\" is true and the perspective of the Indain is lost in time.  Lee tells history, and explains history in a clear and concise manner without all of the glossed over glamor of the typical writer covering this subject.  Very good reading.
B008XG1X18|3.0|love using app on my phone and would love to on my kindle but it never logs in and force closes. please resolve :(
0062202081|5.0|Great book! I loved It. I'm a huge Justin Bieber fan so of course I enjoyed every single page. lol<br />But even if you aren't a huge fan, or not a fan at all, you might like it. It's really good.<br /><br />He talks about writing his new album BELIEVE! & talks about adjusting to the life of a famous pop star/celebrity.. & a few struggles he has had along the way. He also talks about all the places he has traveled so far.. he takes you ALL AROUND THE WORLD. ;]<br /><br />It's an awesome book!
B00594XOZU|4.0|this app is so useful. thank you kik though the kik person is a little wierd. no offense but honestly
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed the STORY a lot. I read this book as my book club's monthly selection and we all pretty much agreed that the story was wonderful and really held our interest. We did, however, feel bogged down by all the \\"meanings\\" of each flower and found ourselves eventually glossing over the explanations without losing the flow and gist of the story. That is why I give the book 4 stars instead of 5.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The graphics are gorgeous but the game is just a fancy version of bejeweled. It can get frustrating when you can't free the piece you are after.
B0098VXDDS|4.0|Awesome. Lots of violence and blood and some scenes I felt they were repeating but the overall story is amazing.  you can even see scenes from the shooting.
B0053O89RY|4.0|ever since Will & Grace left the airwaves, i've been waiting for another comedy with gay characters. Here it is. sure, some of it is stereotyped, but i think in the end its done in a loving manner and really does have good values placed at the end. And if it in the end brings someone who is totally homophobic to realize gays can be just as crazy and funny as straights, then its all worth it.
0307730697|5.0|What a great book! This was such an easy read and I couldn't put it down. This man's life is remarkable and he and his family are true American heroes.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Stumbled onto these guys through MOG and have been playing it constantly for the last week.  I even bought the album on Amazon, I wanted my own copy.  Also, hopefully it helps the band.  And at $5.99 for this art work....its's an amazing deal!  Buy it!!<br /><br />Also check out the  full KEXP (Seattle Radio) performance on youtube.....Amazon wont let me post the link!<br /><br />It's wonderful to watch these 4 guys create.

B0078XFYDA|5.0|This book was an amazingly entertaining read. It had me laughing and thinking in way I didn't know I could until the very end. It left me wanting more! I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys a more thorough understanding of the world, or someone who just simply wants to be amused.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|it was a wonderful movie, mint condition and played perfectly. I was a little worried about the way the DVD looked but you can tell it's just the way it's designed. Thanks so much!
0316227706|5.0|I pre-ordered this book months ago and it finally arrived; I couldn't be happier! Seth Casteel is an amazing photographer and has really captured a wonderful and different perspective of man's best friend in this collection of Underwater Dogs. The photographs are clear and amazing and each really captures the doggie's personality. I seriously laughed out loud at more than one picture and also \\"oooohed and awwwwed.\\" This book captures my heart and I highly recommend it to all dog lovers!
B00846REIS|5.0|I so enjoyed this book. I could not wait for the next book when I read this the first time. I had to go back because I have read over 60 books between them and couldn't remember the story. I now remember why I put the next book on wish list. I thought the story was so deep and delt with some real life issues that many women and men have been through. I thought siliva did a great job into what someone goes through with sexual abuse. The love EVA and Gideon the story has so many twist and turns in it that makes for a great read. loved it the second time around two.
B006ZZQH4W|5.0|There is always an 'at home' feeling about any of Maeve Binchy's books. You don't have to be Irish, nor even to have visited Ireland, to identify with her stories. Though the books are not part of a series, many of the same characters appear in different tales, giving one the feeling that one is renewing contact with old friends.<br /><br />With the recent passing of a great story teller, there will sadly be no more anticipating the next Maeve Binchy tale, knowing that it will live up to every expectation.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I'm also a survior of sexaul abuse and I can totaly relate to what Eva was going through with the triggers in a realationship. I know what it is like to have a husband who is very protective of me because of my past and I am stronger because of it. I know some comments say that they didnt like the hot and cold ups and downs but it is realy like that in real life. I am one of the lucky ones that had closure but was many years later which help change my life of not looking over my shoulder. I can now openly talk about it now and sometimes I still have bad dreams and wake up screaming, but have I husband who loves me so much and reminds me that he is there and will never let anyone or anything hurt me ever again. I am cheering on Eva and Gideon that they two will have peace in all the blackness that you feel form such abuse.<br /><br />On a lighter note the story is full of great turns and twist that leaves you feeling you can't stop reading to go to bed. I stayed up one night till 4am and tossed and turned worried about why they broke up and how they would get through it all. I love love love this story and I can hardly wait untill the last book comes out....<br /><br />Thanks Sylvia Day for a great read!!
B003TLFCDC|3.0|This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other \\"Alice\\" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!<br /><br />This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney ([[ASIN:B0000TG9E2 Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)]]) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp ([[ASIN:B001HN694K Alice in Wonderland]]), as these are the two most well known Alice's. Rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon will have a specific review of the relevant production with the same review title used throughout.<br /><br />REVIEW OF THIS 2008 PRODUCTION OF ALICE IN WONDERLAND . . .<br />Well, I guess if you were looking to make an argument that Alice in Wonderland cannot be converted to an opera this production might serve as an example. I'm not going to actually make that argument, but this was a tough Alice rendering to sit through for this non-opera buff (I've only seen a couple of operas; Cos&igrave; fan tutte and The Marriage of Figaro). I actually quite like the opera I've experienced so far, but I haven't tuned in quite enough to really fully appreciate it. So I'm thinking this may be more a production suited to opera buffs who would like to see a rendering of the Alice story in a familiar medium, than for Alice in Wonderland buffs wishing to see the story play out in musical form. In fact, between this Alice opera and the other listed on Amazon from Unsuk Chin ([[ASIN:B0015XHQYY Unsuk Chin:  Alice in Wonderland]]), if I could only see one of them I would likely choose Unsuk, despite its flaws. There's simply more to appeal to the eye as well as the ear. Fortunately we need not make such a choice, and this performance does have its strong points.<br /><br />The creator of this opera, Peter Westergaard, chose to forgo the use of an orchestra in his production, choosing instead to use almost solely the actors voices, supplemented only by an English hand bell and a few other sound effects. The result is that what you are listening to a great deal of the time are the high pitched soprano voices of the principal singers, which at times is quite pleasing, but at other times abrasive to my uninitiated ears. Some of the opera is simply spoken, and I actually found that quite pleasing. I think the decision to not employ an orchestra may have been the factor that left folks like me a little tuned out. An instrumental accompaniment would have added balance to the overall sound.<br /><br />Having said all that there are definitely some things to like here. The opera is set on a single stage and uses hardly any props. Fewer than any production I've seen. But they did something quite interesting to make up for it. They used a rear projection screen to paint the scene behind the actors. When Alice (played by ? year old Jennifer Winn) is in the hall of doors looking for a way out, the screen shows one side of the hallway with all the doors. When Alice imbibes the potion on the table (the table itself is also part of the two-dimensional backdrop), the image on the screen is magnified, giving the impression she is shrinking, When Alice needs to grow in size the projector shrinks the image, making her appear larger than normal. This touch was unique and effective.<br /><br />The other plus for this production is that they actually follow the book. So rare! I believe they enacted every major passage from Alice in Wonderland; the outing with her sister, falling down the rabbit hole, the hall of doors, the pool of tears, the caucus race, the rabbit's house, the pigeon and serpent and egg passage (rarely presented), the Duchess's house, the encounter with the Cheshire cat, the tea party, back to the hall of doors to get to the garden, the painting of the roses, the croquet game, the gryphon and the mock turtle, the lobster quadrille, and the tart trial. And much of the dialog was sung or spoken verbatim from the book. Nice going folks!<br /><br />For some reason they swapped genders on the red king and queen. Puzzling. A male played the queen. A female the king. I have absolutely no idea why, but I guess Mr. Westergaard might tell us it had something to do with the tonality of the voices he was looking to express in those two curmudgeons.<br /><br />That's all I can tell you, except turn on the subtitles!<br /><br />---------------<br />All my Alice reviews are on Listmania:<br />1) Click on my user name<br />2) Click on 'Listmania!'<br />3) Then click on See 'Entire List'.jection screen to paint the scene behind the actors.

B000MD9UJC|5.0|I've been running this Nite Ize on one of my many junk drawer mini mag lites for over a year now and I love it. It's amazingly bright and the battery lasts a very long time. I bring it camping and also use it at home to locate dog poop at night when I bring my dog out after dinner. My neighbor saw this light and he was floored at how bright it is. I'm on here to buy him one for being such a great neighbor. I found two more mini mags in my junk drawer for the cause. I own quite a few nice LED lights and I like this one as much as the rest. Sure, you can just buy another flashlight but then what, throw this in the garbage? This mini mag light should last my entire life so it's worth it for me to buy the Nite Ize. I love the push button on-off switch which makes it easy to use the light with one hand.

0316228532|4.0|This is not my usual genre. For me books about modern life generally fall into at least one of the following categories: pretentious, boring, saccharine or trashy. So I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book, which I read out of curiosity; in fact I was completely sucked in, living in the book rather than merely reading it.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is not plot-driven, but essentially, it follows six or seven families in a small English village after the death of a prominent town councillor. Local politics is key, but just as much time is spent on the often fraught relationships between people. There's no clear protagonist, with about a dozen major characters and many minor ones, and the point-of-view constantly shifts among them in a way that could have been annoying, but works. Others have been bored, but I found the pacing excellent, in large part because there are so many interlocking stories: I would not read a book about any one of these individual plotlines, but as is we don't spend enough time with any one character for their story to drag or become too mundane. And Rowling deserves her reputation as an excellent storyteller; I really was fascinated throughout.<br /><br />As for the characters, I was impressed. Characterization isn't one of the Harry Potter books' strongest suits (those being plot, inventiveness and humor), but here everyone is realistic and human. The portrayals are often unflattering: people are self-absorbed, petty, or complacent, family relationships are conflict-ridden, and people deal with issues that may not be apparent from the outside, such as domestic violence, mental illness or drug abuse. Everyone has character flaws. But that's life. Despite a few false notes, such as one sudden transformation at the end, I thought it was brilliant, and no, I didn't hate everyone in the cast any more than I hate everyone in my real life. One of the book's strengths is that everyone has genuine flaws, no one is universally liked by the other characters, and yet you can sympathize or identify with many of the characters (provided you're not expecting clear-cut heroes and villains), and every reader's reactions to them will be a little different. (Reading reviews, I've seen probably 10 different characters cited as people's favorites or \\"the only person I could stand\\"--not many books can do that. For the record, I identified strongly with Parminder, which isn't a reaction anyone else seems to have had.)<br /><br />Stylistically, the prose here is much like in the Harry Potter books: functional, but unlikely to win literary awards anytime soon. The one thing that irritated me was the phonetic language that's (over-)used for the lower-class characters: not sure what notable difference Rowling sees in the pronunciation of \\"wuz\\" and \\"duz\\" versus \\"was\\" and \\"does\\"--mostly this just makes those characters look stupid, which I doubt is her intention.<br /><br />This book has taken some flak for being heavy-handed. I'll admit to a high tolerance for this as long as it's not at the expense of character development; I don't mind that the book is a parable about the importance of caring for our neighbors, nor that the climax reproduces the parable of the good Samaritan. Crucially, Rowling puts realism before her message; the book has been called \\"Dickensian,\\" but when Dickens created poor children for readers to pity, he made them angelic. Krystal, the troubled teen around whom the book revolves, is the opposite: she's rude and aggressive and often irresponsible, she steals and curses and sleeps around--while she seems to have a good heart and the potential to do better, she's anything but romanticized. And the characters whose opinions Rowling probably agrees with (aside from the deceased Barry) are no more idealized, while the ones she probably doesn't are hardly villainous--the smug, conservative Howard Mollison, for instance, seems a decent parent and grandparent.<br /><br />Finally: I think those who hate all the characters are taking this book the wrong way. Yes, everyone's flawed, but.... they're just people. Yes, the book criticizes middle-class complacency.... but I doubt Rowling could have written it without empathy for everyone involved. In the end, the point of all this is that we can't hope to do better if we fail to see the humanity in everyone--even those who might at first seem irredeemable.<br /><br />So, should you read this book? Yes--if you don't mind the inclusion of sex, swearing, domestic abuse, drug addiction, etc.; if you're willing to read about the relationships and politicking of flawed characters in a small town; if you aren't looking for fantasy or anything like Harry Potter. As a reader who grew up with Harry Potter but has since moved on to adult books, I absolutely found it worth my while.se who hate all the characters are taking this book the wrong way.

B001Q4Z5Z4|4.0|\\"Death Race\\" bears little resemblance to the original [[ASIN:B0038SUBEG Death Race 2000 (Roger Corman's Cult Classics)]] but it stands fairly well on its own. This is an action movie pretty much from get go, driven by the star power of Jason Statham and a lot of very cool cars.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me; Set in the near future, the story follows Jensen Ames (Statham) as he enters a prison system that has commercialized the \\"Death Race\\" as a for-profit venture. Prisoners can earn their freedom by winning five races in their highly weaponized and armored cars, but actually stand a much better chance of being killed in an audience pleasing fireball. The acting is decent, the action is great, and the special effects are quite good. There are a lot of plot holes, but they can be overlooked for the enjoyment of the movie.<br /><br />This isn't a deep movie, but it is a fun action flick.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B008O9V4C2|3.0|After first hearing \\"I'm Not the Same Without You\\" a few weeks ago, I felt strange. It was the first time that I had truly not liked a Donald Fagen song. I was hoping that this was just a subpar first single, with the full album more resembling his previous glories.<br /><br />But, at least for me, that has not been the case.<br /><br />The first trip round, there was barely a song that I wanted to listen to again. I was flabbergasted. It was the first time I had ever experienced any disappointment with anything Steely Dan related. The more times I played these songs, I started to form opinions about songs, and then have those opinions either strengthened or weakened with each passing listen. So after more than 12 listens (including 3 since actually buying the thing), I think I'm ready to do my review.<br /><br />1. Slinky Thing - One of the highlights of the album. It has a distinct Fagen solo work feel to it but also stays refreshingly new. Great song.<br /><br />2. I'm Not the Same Without You - I had started to really enjoy this song, but in the past several listens, I just can't get into it. It's just too \\"poppy\\" for me. Fagen always had that great mix of jazz and pop-rock that places him (and Walter) among the greatest musical geniuses of all time. I feel with this track that he just completely disregarded his jazzy roots and went straight on full pop. The music just seems soulless to me. Maybe it's that Carlock isn't playing the drums, but the beat just lacks any life to it. The background vocals sound bored, and Fagen sounds like he's going through the motions. And the lyrics are nothing to boast about, either. A very mediocre track.<br /><br />3. Memorabilia - This is the most complicated one, for me. I'm not blown away by it like I am with a few other ones, but I'm also not ready to claim it as a bad song. It's nothing new, it sounds like it could fit on Everything Must Go, but it does have a good sound to it. It's not a bad song in the least, it's just nothing stands out in it. I feel we're in comfortable territory here, but almost too comfortable. It's almost like Fagen could churn out a dozen songs like these without breaking a sweat. And because he's such a genius, they would sound pretty decent. But there's nothing distinct about this one.<br /><br />4. Weather in My Head - Far and away my least favorite song on the album. Bland, repetitive working of a standard blues styling. Except for the clever Al Gore reference, there's not much I like about this song. Great guitar work? Sure, obviously... it is a Donald Fagen album. But I need a little more than that for a good tune. So stay for the guitar, and not much else.<br />[Edit: I have grown to really like this track. My 4th favorite on the album.]<br /><br />5. The New Breed - Another great song, one of the best on the album. This one could fit so perfectly on Two Against Nature that it's almost scary. Fantastic song that really shows just how awesome this guy can be in the 21st century.<br /><br />6. Out of the Ghetto - I don't understand why there is a cover song on this album... Sure, I know The Nightfly had \\"Rudy Baby\\", but it's easily one of the weakest songs on that masterpiece. It seems like this may have been included for filler. Nothing stands out here at all. It's definitely not a bad song; it's just an uninspired and uninteresting cover that would have worked better at a Dukes of September show.<br /><br />7. Miss Marlene - If you've been listening to the album, you know that there's not much that needs to be said about this one. The clear highlight of the disc, the undisputed masterpiece. Everything about it works perfectly. I'd put it up against any Fagen or Steely Dan song post-Nightfly.<br /><br />8. Good Stuff - The crib-notes of this album for me seem to be \\"good, not great\\".  This, again, is a decent track... but just nothing special or interesting. It has a strong Circus Money feel, but it seems to have been influenced by the weaker tracks on that fantastic album. Could be a grower... so time will tell.<br /><br />9. Planet D'Rhonda - This one feels like a 21st Century version of Tomorrow's Girls, except lacking everything that makes that song great. A lot of cringeworthy lines in this one: \\"I gotta have CPR\\", \\"It was off the hook, crazy sweet\\", \\"D's my vitamin XYZ\\". The music's pretty good in this one, but it sounds so subdued. There's nothing that makes the melody stand out. But the main problem for me in this one is that I find the lyrics lacking in Fagen's trademark wit and substance.<br /><br />So overall, as you might have guessed, I'm not in love with it. There are three fantastic songs with clever lyrics and ridiculously good music. (Slinky Thing, The New Breed, Miss Marlene). They're the soul of the album.<br /><br />Overall, I think the biggest problem for me is that it lacks any new variety or \\"flavor\\" that makes a Fagen/Dan album great. Every album has a distinct sound, where the tracks could only fit on that album. Morph the Cat and Circus Money are two recent examples that accomplished this with flying colors. This one lacks that soul, it lacks that life.<br /><br />There is some good music here, no doubt. Some of the songs are highlights of Fagen's work in the last decade or so. And even the weaker songs are better than most of the nonsense that gets spit out in modern pop music.<br /><br />I realize I am in the minority with this opinion, and I wish I liked it more, but so far it just hasn't clicked. But I do recommend getting it, because any Fagen is better than nothing.

I can say, without a doubt, this is the highest quality headset I've ever owned. It has many pros, with very few cons. The sound is wonderful, the mic quality is outstanding, and it's comfortable. The only con, is the battery life isn't as long as I'd like it to be, and it takes a bit to charge. However, this could probably be resolved, if I moved cords around on my desk, to still wear the headset while it charges.

AT first I was disappointed that the beginning of the book was not about the killing of Osama Bin Laden but as i got to the middle of the book i realized that he needed to show the close connection among the men who were selected to carry out this mission.  If you are not familiar with military terms, at times it can be a bit confusing. All in all, worth the money.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed Fifty Shades Darker. . . it really begins to get into the psyche of the oh so dark, Mr. Grey.  By the end of this book, I couldn't wait to get into the very last book to find out what happened to Christian and Anastsia.  The more you would read the more you would get to find out about what makes Christian Grey tick and if Ana would ever be able to accept him or if he loved her enough to change to be more acceptable to her.  I would recommend this book, to a more mature reader.  I really find it hard to believe that any two human beings could have that much sex. . . . sometimes 5-6 times a day. . . just saying.  I think the first two books would have been a little better with a few less sex scenes, it might have given the reader something to look forward to instead of having it shoved in your face every 10-20 pages.  But I definitely recommend the entire trilogy, so that you willl know what all of the fifty shades talk is about.  FYI, the last book (Fifty Shades Of Freedom) is definitely the best, but you have to read the first two to get to that.  Happy Reading!

Having this story read to me was intriguing, audibly addicting. The narration is superb and gets into your head right away. Being a straight male and listening to the hypnotic voice of the narrator gave the book or story a whole new facet. I enjoyed it very much and just ordered book two of the trilogy along with the music choices also on CD. The best way to describe this story on audio is, \\"Peaceful, Relaxing, Enticing and Intriguing.\\"<br /><br />As for the purchase from Amazon,  A+ as always

B007U1FEJE|5.0|This is one of the better of the later Beach Boys albums. Not since Surfs Up have they produced such a good sound and harmony. This is probably the last time you will hear most all of the original members of this great band now that Mike Love has fired Brian Wilson. The best of the best `when it comes to writing and producing. Its too bad.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Follett is the master of realism story telling.  He keeps you interested by moving round the lives of the characters while intertwining history.  We see all sides in the wars and you remember the characters and look forward to catching up with their personal and professional journey's.  These are as good as the pillars of the earth - I look forward to where he takes us in the next book. No fairytale - but a raw glimpse at war, politics and people, I recommend it to all my friends and colleagues often - they all agreed we are on a winner. Thanks
B007FEFLTO|5.0|WHAT A MARVELOUS BOOK.  JUST WHWN YOUTHINK THEY CAN\\"T GET ANY BETTR, THEY DO.  CAN\\"T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE.  WHEN WILL IT BE AVAILABLE ?
B00976N384|3.0|I was very excited about this album because I have loved the Killers's previous work. This one was very underwhelming. It is still a good album and any fan of the Killers should pick it but, but I do not think it was worth the full price I paid for it.
0553386794|4.0|I heard about the HBO show a few months before it came out, so I decided I should read the first book to see if I would like it. I've since read all five and watched the series. This review is for the first book only.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones introduces us to a feudal world of intrigue. We get our first impressions of characters we are going to follow through many more books. This volume is the second best of the five books GRRM has written at the time of this review, and we get a good taste of what makes this series great.<br /><br />Some people who read fantasy prefer stories about \\"good guys\\" vs \\"bad guys\\" like the Lord of the Rings or other big fantasy writers like Robert Jordan or Brian Sanderson. You may like these authors and still like aGoT, but if you need \\"good guys\\" with superhuman skills and magic you should look elsewhere. In this book, the heroes are definitely preferable to the villains, but are still the beneficiaries and executors of a feudal system that mostly benefits the upper class. After the prologue, the book opens with the Starks attending a beheading, this chapter sets the tone for the rest of the book.<br /><br />The other great thing about this book is that this world clearly has magic and mystery, which we get to see right from the prologue, but it is kept mysterious. Magic occurs rarely and shocks the people of this world as much as it would shock you in real life. The sparing use of magic really makes the whole thing a lot more fun. No wizards shooting magic missiles left and right will be found here.<br /><br />Overall, this book puts you in the frame of mind of a person who lives in this world. GRRM makes it matter to you which family sits on the Iron Throne. He accomplishes this by rejecting the idea of a hero we know can't die because he is the main character. This book is fantasy if you populated it with real mortals.<br /><br />Don't miss out, the HBO series is great, but this book gives you a lot of details you would otherwise miss.e miss.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|i love this charger!! no more buying batteries every month. it also looks great with my imac! mouse charges fast!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|The second volume in the series moves a little slower than the first, and has fewer scenes with big emotional impact. I love all the books but this one is tied with A Dance with Dragons for 3rd best. There is a lot of great stuff in this book that is done better than the HBO series, particularly Jon Snow and Arya. There are a few scenes that were also hard to translate into television, for instance some of Dany's POV regarding prophesies.<br /><br />Don't miss out, read this book even if you have seen the show.
B003JIPJRE|4.0|A well done story, and nicely animated.  Of course, as expected, great voice acting from DC Animated. I loved it, however meant for a more mature audience, no small kids please.
055357342X|5.0|This book will destroy you.<br /><br />The number of key events with huge emotional impact is higher in this book than any other in the series. This book is the wildest and most memorable. Hopefully GRRM will deliver more of this quality with The Winds of Winter.
B005LAII58|5.0|As announced this week, The Expendables 2, will be released on November 20th, 2012. The SRP is $29.99 for the DVD edition. I can't hardly wait to pre-order this adventure from Amazon.Com (better sooner than later) ASAP !!!<br />This ride should provide many hours of entertaining fun for all...enjoy :) :) :)<br />Merry Christmas & Happy New Year...have fun !<br />JWC II
1421527618|4.0|I really, really liked this book. It is written in a unique first person voice, light on description and heavy on monologue, that I did not like initially. It really grew on me though. There are several anime tropes in this book that were entertaining to see in written form. Keiji Kiriya is the classic lovelorn anime protagonist who has no idea where his life is taking him. It is fun to watch him transform into a confident blood spraying alien slaying badass.<br /><br />The premise of the aliens was odd to me at first, but the explanation is knowledge dumped on us from an omniscient voice about halfway through the book. I thought it was actually pretty good reasoning.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is I usually expect five star books to make me think a little more, and push a few more emotional buttons. This book does do that in some spots, but it is mostly action.<br /><br />You won't regret picking it up.
B000GCFO08|1.0|movie was no were close to the game was very disapointed in it,,hopefully they will make one closer to what the game was about
B00992CF6W|5.0|wanna get it but mom wont let me. it looks fun my cousins have it on ipod touched and its very popular. I wanna get it!!!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|great game.  relaxing way to spend your time when u have a few minutes to beg out and nothing else to do:)
B001GQ2BNQ|3.0|There are things I like and thiings I don't like about this snorkel.  I like that it allows you to swim freestyle without coming up for air.  I don't think it is that comfortable, and I usually have to take it off after the first mile.  It also gets a buildup of spit in it that I have to keep spitting out.  I don't use it that often, but it comes in handy if I have a stiff neck.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game .It is great I am on level 146. I play two to three times a day, you will find yourself building points by resting the game either overnight or by hours of inactivity only to pick it up and play until you have exhausted your coins. ENJOY!!!!
B00466HM28|1.0|This product sucked!! I waited so long to reciece it and Only to find out that it did not work! There was no receipt sent with it. Like all my amazon purchases have had. I want my money back!
B009AJDDQU|1.0|Amazon, you didn't let me post this comment the first time on grounds of profanity. If BS is profanity, check this link out; it has BS in it, too. Don't worry, you're not gonna have any problems seeing it, it's all in CAPS.<br />I'm sure there are hundreds more with BS in it out there . So, my review of this piece of junk, is complete BS.

B0032Y8XH8|1.0|I got the new Mumford and Sons Excited to see how the band progressed Musically. Sadly They did not, This new album sounds exactly like there first album. Sigh no more is a waste of money and Mumford and Sons has proved to me that they do not know how to grow as musicians.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Loved it; hated the cliffhanger.<br />I highly reccomend it!!!!<br />It captivated my attention from the first page. Riordan  is back with hilarious twists and turns!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is fun. However it is a money spender. You can win (via kung fu scrat) things you pay for.
0525953728|4.0|It is the most interesting book I have ever read. I have never liked a book so much. It is the only book that I actually want to read.
B0086700CM|5.0|love it! They should make the characters actually have better things. no point spending all of those coins for characters that are same speed
B004YM6JLO|5.0|love this show!!!  can damon get any hotter?!  I sure hope so!  i hope this show goes on forever!  the DVD's came in great condition!  i would definitely purchase more goodies from this store!  life is good :)
B0084I9QI2|5.0|this album is the greatest of all time<br />i enjoyed all the minutes of it<br />everyday i watch the concert<br /><br />Michael the king of pop rock & soul :)
B008JAFXOQ|5.0|This is probably his greatest film yet.  It's incredibly realistic, both emotionally and also in how it depicts physical reality (right down to an incredibly graphic opening scene).  But it's also quite disturbing to watch this young character's struggles.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love history and Ken Follett knows how to write a fascinating story of families living and loving through the events of World War II in Russia, Germany, England and the US. The description of life in Germany and Russia under Hitler and Stalin create real emotions of fear and tension in me. I find it hard to put the book down! Can't wait for the third book.
B00640Z0RI|5.0|For a generation born during or right after the war, this is a gripping depiction of the absurdity of that era--or really of any war.  The writing style creates a tension that is absolutely palpable.  I've recommended this book to a dozen friends over the years and every single one of them has loved it.
B008NW67E0|3.0|I hate to disagree, but I found this latest CD from Mumford & Sons more than a little mediocre.  This is especially noticeable when Sigh No More & Babel are played back to back.  Babel just doesn't have the individual distinctness of their first CD.  The songs tend to blend together making it seem as if they're singing one very long song.  It just doesn't have the same polish of Sigh No More, nor the opportunity for any memorable hits.  Among the new offerings, I only counted three that I liked: I Will Wait, Ghosts That We Knew, and For Those Below.  The rest were sadly forgettable.  They were also, for the most part, too angry, and too loud.  If they thought they were trying to be edgier this time, with a harder sound, all they really gained was a harshness I didn't appreciate.<br /><br />I think they went too far off the beaten path.
B005LLX582|5.0|The first time I watched The Tree of Life, I found myself frustrated and perplexed by the nonlinear storytelling, non-descriptive character development, and cinematography that generally focused on inanimate objects with no sense of purpose. The second time I watched it, I applied a scientific and psychological lens in order to see the film in a new way. During this viewing, I discovered the beautify behind the film, the possible message the director was attempting to portray, as well as reaffirming my sense of nontheistic beliefs. The film is meant to be seen and understood in a personal way, which is rare for a film to achieve successfully without limiting and/or frustrating its audience, but here, Malick has succeeded in creating something that could easily be labeled as one of the best films of all-time.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|this is a great addition to the kindle fire. not only is it great for a protective cover but it makes for a great stand for when i use it for recipes and general reading.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|ok, let me start by saying it's not a romance it's erotica. There is no love, only sex, any attempts form the author to show emotions in this book, either then desire, failed. And i don't have any problems with erotica, well soft erotica in a good romance book, but this, let me put it nicely nonsense<br /><br />i didn't have high expectations with mixed reviews and after hearing from friends who actually decided to read it. One of them said, it's like twilight, well let me tell you, i'll take shining vampires any day over this<br /><br />so i begin the book, first couple of pages, were ok, i didn't mind the writing, but with repeating words and sentences that's gets annoying. But what i don't like is plagiarize, as i read more in the book it feels more and more as twilight, Anastasia is Bella, but when it gets to Christian, very soon you realize that's not Edward at all. Christian is not caring night in shining armors, quite the opposite. The \\"Love\\" story is ridicules, i found a bit of humor in their email conversation, but all other interactions repulsed me. So yes, i hated that book. I don't want to judge, but i really don't get all the glorious reviews, and it's beyond me to understand how somebody can like this story, i mean the scenes are very graphical so maybe just that, which is apparently not for me.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen. Can't wait for the sequel!!  Hope all the same heros will be back.
B009M8TA20|4.0|Just finished reading the book and wondered to give it 3 or 4 stars. I agree totally that there are way better biographies and soccer books written, but at the same time this is not bad either.<br /><br />After finishing Agassi's Open, this is a fall back in quality, but the personality of the player comes through as well as much information about the soccer / football world. I do suggest this book to be read, however be sceptic and bear in mind, that there are always two sides of coins. In this book we get to know one side of it.<br /><br />Personally I did like to read the book and would recommend it to others who are interested in sports and biographies. How ever, it is no the best book, thus the 3/4 stars.
B00009EJC5|5.0|I first heard In the jungle groove at a Grateful Dead concert in the 90's playing between sets and lost my shit! the whole album is full of infectious grooves that will get into your soul and make your bootie wiggle and once you are done play it again!
B0086700CM|5.0|That's the greatst game ever invtortinon on earth. I love this game so much this is the game on earth. Buy this app.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm am so loving Gideon and Eva's story. Book 2 is well wriiten and is also very addicitive lol. I can't stop reading....
B0089X38EU|5.0|I bought this CD for my husband and he just loves it.  Sound quality is so much<br />better today than it was back in the day.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Good, not as good as the book, but that's to be expected. Its got action and a bit of love I guess. It wasn't bad and if you want to see it just to see it, I'd say it wouldn't be a waste.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I have watched this movie over 10 times, and I never tire of it.  Robert Duval & Tommie Lee Jones are jut an awesome pair in this movie.
B008QE9VJI|1.0|Expected this to be funny, but really wasnt. Was soooooo dark that is was odd bc we were expecting humor. The witch did a very convincing job unlike Charlize Theron in Snow White and the Huntsman, other than that, the movie stunk. I kept expecting something, but it never happened. It was too dark to enjoy when you are expecting a comedy.
8866130915|2.0|I've used Moleskin planners for a couple of years, now. I accidentally picked up the 12-month, when I was expecting an 18-month. Ok. I can deal with that.<br /><br />The weekly layout is the perfection I expected. One week per page with a lined page opposite. I use this page for reminders, to-dos and random notes. I stick post it notes to that side with my grocery list. It's perfect.<br /><br />But, the monthly pages in the front are much different than previous versions. I believe I read that this was changed in both the 12 and 18 month planners for 2013. I wanted and needed a full page for each month with the typical grid layout. I plan my long term projects in these pages. What it has is a measly line per day: two columns per page, one month per column. I guess they're trying to save money by reducing the number of pages. It's not so easy to look at, for example, every Monday anymore.<br /><br />I'll give this a shot for the year, but if next year's planner is the same I'll have to find another provider.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|I liked the movie, but charlize Theron really did not do well. Sometimes she did, but for the most part the role did not fit her. She was not convincing and she did not pull it off. It didnt suit her for some reason. Her english accent was terrible, and it would have been better that she spoke normally than do the accent badly. She is a fantastic actress, but this one was not her best. Overall the movie was very good, good action, acting, etc. I liked it, but not as much as I whished I had.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Loved this movie, and the kids wanted to watch it again and again.  A lot of action and humor, but not gory and clean enough for young children.
0525953728|5.0|Awesome! Easy to read and this book kept my attention through the whole thing.  Thank you fot your sacrifice for our freedom!
B0055QYKQO|5.0|I Bought the Motherboard around May of 2012 I have been a lifer Intel CPU Guy for over 30 Years! I have been doing a bunch of research to see what the AMD guys have been talking about all this time and since so many friends seem sold on AMD I decided to check it out! I have been using a Gigabyte GA-8N-SLA Pro since late 2004, with an Intel 3.6GHz 4 Gig Ram 2 XFX 8600GT SLA Video cards and 2 200Gig HDDs and 2 DVD/CD Burners and 1 external 1Tb eSATA FD Drive and a TV tuner. I do a lot of movies and graphic design stuff and this setup has served me very well until recently, It was finally starting to show its age and outdatedness! Lost the internal Ethernet chip, started taking 10 minutes to boot! and the USB ports got flaky etc. I think the 500WHT Power Supply started going bad as when I tested it the +5 volts was way out of range! Got a 800Wht and things where better but I think the damage was already done and the mother board was sinking fast! SO.. I figured it was time to check out this new Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD3 and try AMD and see what all the hubbub was about! (O; I picked this board because I knew Gigabyte from several people using them and all working great excepting my last one but Gish 8 years I think was a good test! it had only been messing up the last year and so I was very satisfied with Gigabyte! the other things where it had both SLA and Cross-Fire and the slots where fare enough apart to prevent suffocating one of the Video cards by being to close to the first! It has all the latest features like USB 3.0 SATA 3.0 Ultra Durable 2 Times the Copper PCB the board is noticeably more rigid the others I looked at, you know you push the Ram in and it feels like the board is going to snap! not this one! and with more copper you don't need to worry about burning the board runs if you don't get enough power to some of the power sucking Video cards out there today! that always bothered my on some of the old boards and I have replaced some Clients Mobs after the runs burnt through for just that reason, I would still run the external power cables to a big Vid Card to be safe but I don't see worrying about it as the new 2 times the copper can Handel considerably more amps! Yeah I miss the Floppy connector But that's progress right? the floppy today is a flash card of like 64 Gigs, you'd only need one! LOL and I got a USB external Floppy drive in case I remembered something I needed that was on an old floppy? But I can't really think of anything? LOL The board is ver 1.2 and came with the latest F5 Bios and just a load of stuff if you go to Gigabyte online and look it up you can get all the details, far to many to report in here. The other thing is that it run a nice array of AMD CPUs and is AM3+ Ready! So in reviewing all the good stuff about AMD and maybe what I been missing as in all honesty I'm Not all the impressed with the I3, I5 and I7 Intel CPUs! That's may opinion but I mean for the Price of a nice I7 CPU I could buy 2 AMD Bulldozer's with 8 CPUs! Its just not that coast effective and I have used some of the I7's in Clients PCs and I think they fall short for all the hype about them? Again just my opinion! so I got the AMD Black Edition FX 6 Core Bulldozer @ 3.3 GHz 14.0MB Cache.. Now the reason I didn't go with the 8 Core is because after doing more research I learned the Microsoft windows 7 does NOT Support the AMD 8 Core! It will be incorporated in an update to Win 7 but who knows when? and then I can always upgrade. Microsoft and Intel have been bed Buddy's for many, many years and that's My opinion also but I got the information from Intel and MS from all the years I been running Intel CPUs and Windows, Heck they don't want AMD to shin too brightly over the I7 so lets just leave it at that and I know you will all find out for your selves if so motivated. I assume that once Intel get the I7 faster or comes out with an I10 or I12 they will put the code in 7 for the AMD 8 core? so just FYI! (o; Well the other thing Idid was made the jump from WIN XP Pro to WIN 7 Home Pro upgrade to 3 of your home PCs, BOY they really needed to finally come out with that! I have 6 to 8 computers in my house depending on what kids are home etc.! and that gets to be a big chunk of change to buy WIN 7 for each one! Lets just say I ant that rich! LOL But OK so there you have it! I am going to get 2 newer Video cards but right now this Mother Board is the ONE! I really have nothing Bad to say about it! I got games and tones of utilities and stuff on this thing and I have not even over clocked this monster yet and It literally Flies It boots in a few seconds! I went to 64 bit and WIN says your gonna loss all your XP programs! not so! I backed up my stuff and figured I would have to re-install everything else! It put all my software and data files in a Windows (OLD) folder and all my 32 bid apps load in a Program Files (x86) folder and they ALL run fine from there! Dang I'm So happy! LOL I never ever thought I would be this Happy with this great MB and AMD, And WIN 7! I been pounding this thing for the past 4 months and can't find a thing wrong with it! I wrote a Review for WIN 7 already so enough about that, But if your an AMD fan or if you like Intel and you always wanted to try the other side? GET this Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD3 Mother Board and pick a AMD Bulldozer CPU and Hang ON! This mother board had enough new features that I can't see it going like out of date for at least 5 years! And I will be using mine longer then that (The PC God Willing) Really do your own research, check it out! I don't think you can go wrong with this one! (o: I wrote the book on if it can go wrong? it will go wrong! Well, I think when I kicked Intel to the curb I got FREE from that! SO, If your looking for a new setup or thinking its about time to get up to date? I would 100% go with this setup you can buy a cheaper CPU and upgrade later? But the board is the best buy for the price and If you where going to get a new Intel board and I7 CPU? You'll have enough change left from this AMD setup to buy your memory, HDDs, CDROM drives and WIN 7 and have enough left to buy lunch! I can't wait to pump this thing up a little but really I don't need too! and it runs 30* cooler then my Intel 3.6MHz playing WOW, or Tanks! or what ever and I got this thing in an old Desktop case! Not a tower, Its flat, fits under my hutch shelf and NO Air flow and its still runs Cool! write now I got 8 windows open and writing this and browsing for a new Video card and doing my E-mail and I just check and its running at 42* C, or 110* F.<br />  SOOOoooo.. get one! (o;  You can check me out I don't work for Amazon or Intel or AMD, I'm just a computer fix it guy for over 30 years 17 of that at a major bank! so this IS ALL just my findings and thoughts, I have no reason to try to make you buy one of these things I just want Computer Geeks like me to know when a real good deal comes along, That's It.. Take care and have fun, Happy putering.. Rick.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Love this series! There were so many plot lines and families so it was hard to follow at first, but after a few episodes I couldn't stop watching. Can't wait for season 3 in the spring!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|it is ok but do not let it fool u it worked for a while but no its not letting me on
1439102430|5.0|Super mystery.  This is a well written page turner.  Though it doesn't go along the same story lines as the TV series, it is just as interesting.  This is definitely not a production line writer.  Each story is different.
B002ZCY7SW|4.0|I haven't had a chance to review it was water damaged in a apartment fire.But I believe that the were okay.

B001LM1456|5.0|It was amazing I have seen it before but this time it was even better. I highly reccomend you renting or purchasing this film.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|The Timekeeper is a different sort of book, one that makes you really think about your own life as the characters' \\"way out there lives\\" are being played out right before you.  The things that happen aren't believe-able, or are they? I bought the book solely because Mitch Albom wrote it and once again, he led me on an entertaining and thought provoking journey.  Should you buy the book?  Yes!  Why?  Because it's a Mitch Albom.  Enough said.
B009NQCK7I|5.0|Castle and Beckett believe a murder case is linked to a storage locker. Castle bids and wins the storage locker and its contents, but only finds cheap trashy treasures. When Captain Victoria Gates sees Castle holding a rare porcelain doll that would complete her collection, he happily hands it over. Suddenly, the captain loves Rick and even buys a complete set of his books for him to autograph. Working through a list of suspects, the murder victim's employer's household and seemingly unrelated low lifes, the reason for murder and perpetrator is found. Unfortunately, resolving the murder costs Castle his new found friendship with the captain and she is back to hating him by the end of the episode. Very funny entry in the Castle cannon.
B007VUA7VO|2.0|Got this as FAOTD. Great except for smutty ads. Those remaining on it will make me delete this app. Please remove them. I have deleted it since the adds are still on there.
1616960922|5.0|I am an unabashed Brandon fan, having read all of his books. My son and I enjoy reading and talking about them all. I bought this book with considerable trepidation, having become accustomed to those fat Sanderson books (the books, not Brandon)that will not fit into your hip pocket with a shoe horn, telling a marvelous story that takes days or perhaps a week to get through, keeping me entranced and anxiously awaiting the next reading opportunity. But - I bought the darned thing anyway and found it to be absolutely stunning in it's simplicity of form. To me, harkening back to the favorite of my youth, Ernest Hemmingway. In this thoroughly enchanting book one hardly notices that the entire book, until the very end, takes place in the confines of a single small room. BUT don't let that keep you from purchasing this little gem, it is as big in spirit, excitement and drama as any book Brandon has written (maybe better).
B0098VXE50|5.0|This movie was great, a must see. It was a unique spin on a timeless story. I would recommend that you see this movie, you won't be disappointed!
B0053KWDES|5.0|Besides improving the sound quality whether I'm using ue700s, triplefi10s or Shure 215s, the battery on my iPod nano and iPod classic now last forever!  Well worth the price.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is a great game. A lot of different patterns and skill levels. Keeps ME entertained for hours! If you like Mahjong games this is one of the best I have ever played.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|Great special effects, kept me interested.  I think the over the top ridiculous characters takes away from the movie.  I know we are stretching our imagination but come on.  I know in Aliens he always had crews of hard edge, back talking thugs that didn't like the straight laced person but it has been over done.  Quirky characters will a little something different works so much better and helps make it believable.<br />All in all a good movie, not too much gross stuff.<br />I only gave it three stars because I think it could have been so much better.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game is very addictive and engaging.  It is difficult to stop playing! Although the backstory is slow, it has beautiful graphics and effects.

B007VPLNGW|5.0|This game is very addictive! When I first installed the game I almost deleted it because it was like angry birds and it was easy. now that I have had this game for a while it has gotten very tricky and I realized that it was worth the. 99!!:)
0345803485|3.0|Enough has been said about the content of this book, both good and bad. It was an entertaining read to me. Not the best, not the worst. Ironically, kinda vanilla! My only critique I'll leave here is that the ending isn't really an ending, but more like a, \\"to be continued...\\" into the next book. I get that it's a trilogy, but I personally think each book should stand on it's own. Now to decide if i am going to subject myself to two more books to get an actual ending.
B006DICWUE|4.0|I've been a Nada Surf fan ever since I caught their video for \\"Always Love\\" years ago. I've enjoyed the progression and maturity that they've shown with each album and this record is no exception. I'll admit that I was underwhelmed on my first listen. It felt stale and lacked the catchy melodies that we've all come to love and expect from the group. After a few more spins it slowly began to sink in and the songs started to worm their way into my subconscious. It's a slow-burner but gradually the album begins to come together and really shine.<br /><br />For starters, the bright melodies are here in abundance. \\"No Snow on the Mountain\\" is my favorite cut, a fast-paced and uptempo number that sounds like classic Nada Surf. \\"Clear Eye Clouded Mind\\", \\"Jules and Jim\\", and \\"Looking Through\\" are all standouts that continue to push the band forward and they carry a sense of urgency not heard since [[ASIN:B00004W5KD Proximity Effect]] back in 1998. Matthew Caws continues to use his featherlight voice to great effect, bringing the listener into the songs and emoting feelings we've all had at one time or another. The two ballads on the album, \\"When I Was Young\\" and \\"Let the Fight Do the Fighting\\" are perfect examples of what he can do and how he's able to craft a compelling melody. My only real complaint is that his lyrics seem much more vague this time around. Previous records were full of relatable stories and personal revelations that made it easy to keep coming back to the songs. Here the tunes are certainly fun but I feel a certain depth is lacking and that makes them a bit less memorable. There are also a couple tracks, namely \\"The Future\\" and \\"The Moon Is Calling\\", that are middle of the road and feel more like filler than essential compositions.<br /><br />Overall, The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy is another solid effort from Nada Surf. It may not grab you immediately but give it time. The rewards are worth it.

0142406112|5.0|I read this book when I was 10 years old.. And loved it. I am currently 21 years old, and still love it. It is always a great book to pick up and read and find new details. It always fills me with my action fix whenever I need it. It is a book filled with action, deceit and a teenage spy that is conned and used by M16 into saving the world.<br /><br />Alex Rider has been training all his life to be a spy without even knowing it. His uncle dies with a bizarre incident and Alex is given details that just do not add up. His suspicions are settled when he discovers his uncles car in a junkyard with bullet holes in it. What does this mean? Was Alex's uncle not a banker after all? Who would shoot a banker? He becomes an everyday hero, thrown in with grown men trying to save the day. Evil villain Herod Sayle has a master plan to destroy the youth of Britain? Will Alex Rider be able to discover the mystery and save the day? Or will the youth of Great Britain be destroyed? This book helps to get you thinking and asking lots of questions. It makes you wonder how Alex will escape his captors? How Alex will save the day? Will Alex save the day? And how will this event change his life? This book keeps your mind going in circles as Alex fights villains, uses crazy gadgets, and lives the secret life of a teenage spy. This book makes me wonder if government agencies truly will do anything to get the mission accomplished. Are teenage boys really used in operations? Will they really do anything in their power and put innocent youth at risk? These were all questions I began asking throughout Stormbreaker and the rest of the series.<br /><br />This is a great book to read and leaves the reader with a lot of action, excitement and thrilling moments. It keeps the reader on his or her toes and makes them wonder what will happen next. The imagination is constantly at work and constantly asking questions, exactly what a book is meant to do. It is a 5/5 and a must read for any action lover.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|Alas, this one is a total let down.  I'm still reading it, more than half way and struggling to finish.  Books one and two were good, but the third is tiresome.  It's the same soup warmed over.  No real development of characters or plot.  It's like I was teased to keep reading from books one and two and to get to this, Holy let down. And as others have stated, the same phrases, sex, and low self-esteem, anorexic lettuce-eater girl, Ana.  Oh well, she (author) got what she wanted out of us, and that's the sale.  Holy Robin, where's Batman when you need him?

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent production from start to finish - plot, costumes, sets, acting,,,, It is the best I have viewed in several years.  It is a cut above all the network and even HBO and Showtime series...
B009KHDT0C|2.0|This movie certainly did not live up to its potential. The storyline raced through without stopping to let us care about any of the characters. There was no development of the love story. It was not funny. Depp overacted and played his part as a caricature in such a way as to make the character brittle and cold. Poorly done!

B008ACC9CM|5.0|Jonathan and Charlotte are two of the nicest, most talented and deserving singers you can imagine.  Jonathan has been blessed with one of the most amazing tenor voices I have ever heard, and Charlotte has a clear, soulful soprano that perfectly compliments the power and beauty of Jonathan's once-in-a-lifetime voice.  The producers did an amazing job of choosing songs appropriate to their talent and youth, and while capturing their operatic skills, never sounds \\"wrong\\" for such young singers (they're 17) in their debut album.  I have been playing this constantly since I bought it.  Fortunately the dogs and cats don't mine, and even though it isn't necessarily my partner's style, she has said repeatedly how beautiful it is.  You won't regret this purchase.  Listen to :Unintended\\" on YouTube, as well as their auditions, if you have any questions about whether you should purchase. this album.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena was as great continuation to the previous books in the Heros of Olympus. It flawlessly reunited Annabeth and Percy and created more adventure!

B000163X5W|1.0|This is the second time that I have ordered \\"Casper.\\"  The first time I was willing to take the blame, but this time there is no excuse.  I ordered it for my granddaughter, imagine how disappointed she was to learn that we had to have a DVD player that would play region 1 DVDs.  This is ridiculous!  I am on the east coast, maybe just maybe you should see that and send another DVD region or at the very least say what region your DVDs are from.<br /><br />Now I am out for two Casper DVDs plus the shipping and handling and tax if there were any.  Can't return them as little hands opened the boxes before I arrived home from work in excitement!<br /><br />NOW YOU TELL ME WHAT I AM SUPPOSED TO DO?  HUH?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great series.  The setting and all the details and costumes are superb.  The acting is wonderful and the storyline is interesting in each episode enticing the viewer to continue on to the next episode.
0525952926|3.0|I so eagerly awaited Ken Follett's second book in the Century Series and pre-ordered the novel from amazon, receiving it the day after publication.<br />As much as I enjoyed reading about WWII from individual character's accounts, there were way too many characters to keep straight.<br />I had to work at remembering the families and who was what from Fall of Giants. Consequently, I needed at least an hour to read at each sitting or I was confused trying to keep the characters straight.<br />Follett lists the characters in the front of the book, along with their respective country of origin, but he needs to include a family tree!<br />Also, I found that there were too many sexual sidelines that detracted from the narrative. Yes, I realize that there was a \\"desperation\\" of sort because people feared they might die in the war, but Follett went way overboard on the sex, making Winter of the World deteriorate into pulp fiction of the drugstore variety.<br />The chronology of events in the war was well done, but there were way too many coincidences in the novel, as well as \\"politically correct\\" posturing to make it believeable.

B006J3Y20Q|5.0|The area of literature for young adults is spread thinly. It's the one area in publishing where there is never a glut of material in the slush pile. Perhaps this is the cause of so few classic brilliant books in this genre: Heidi, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\", \\"The Borrowers\\", A Wrinkle In Time\\" and \\"Things Unseen\\". The mark of excellent adolescent literature is that it is equally brilliant when read by a fifty year old; that the characters are well defined and sympathetic and that the theme of the book si clear and universal. Lois Lowry is famous now for her best seller \\"The Giver\\" and the final installment of this quadrilogy, \\"Son\\" is just released. To remind everyone of \\"the Giver\\" is most apt.<br /> The community in which our central character has grown up in is much like what Karl Marx envisioned in \\"The Communist Manifesto\\". Lowry calls it Sameness, not equality and like REAL communism, regardless of what appears on paper it's an impossible dream. With the Soviet Union it was about human greed and power. With the community where Jonas lives with his family unit it's about the lack of extreme feelings. In order to eliminate the pain and sadness they had to eliminate exuberance and love. The book reaches the halfway point and we learn that Jonas is to be the next \\"Receiver\\" for the community: the keeper of historic memories. And he is trained by an old man who is now called \\"The Giver.\\" Jonas see's that there are some serious flaws in their way of life and he is forced to make a choice of massive consequence.<br /> The books is so well crafted, not a single word or moment is waste3d, whether it is a snow sled that later becomes highly critical or the ominous casual method of residents who must be released. The relationships that occur in the book shift as Jonas grows and receives more memories and suddenly he finds that what has been \\"real\\" his entire life is not at all true. What then is truth?<br /> To begin with, Lowry has found a brilliant way to try to teach our young that joy and pain are partners in life and that both carry lessons with them. So much literature, both adult and children, tries to teach this lesson, from Frost's \\"The Road Not Taken\\" to Camus' \\"The Stranger\\". The truth is that these books and poems (and films and theatre works and songs) are more effective for those who have already learned the lessons of life. And the only way to learn them is to live life. We cannot deny our youth the right to learn these lessons as we did.<br /> This is what the community from \\"The Giver\\" has denied the population the greatest meaning of life: that which is learned by life and not from a book.<br /> Depending upon your age and your place on life's journey, the book will provide you with many shocks and surprises. Certainly for the young the shocking moments will take their breath. Some may call it science fiction- after all, the first half of the book is reminiscent of the planet on which IT lives in Madeleine L'Engle's \\"a Wrinkle In Time\\" except the control is more subtle. Halfway through the book we shift to something that William Styron may have written, and the setting becomes nothing more than a backdrop for a very human story.<br /> This is a must read. And it is a must lend. This book is taught in many Middle Schools, having pushed \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" and \\"The Lottery\\" aside. As parents you must make sure you read the books your children are reading because you want to experience what they are experiencing; you want to be able to discuss the hard issues that they will bring up; you have to add to their reading lists so that \\"Huck Finn\\" and \\"The Lottery\\" remain on their reading list.<br /> And you must add to your own reading list.

B008IJHIAA|5.0|Fans of R.E.M.'s IRS years won't be disappointed by the Document reissue. For me there are two key issues that determine whether a reissue is worth the money (1) is there a meaningful difference in sound quality and (2) is the bonus material compelling. Based on those criteria Document is one of the strongest releases in the R.E.M. 25th anniversary collection so far. Starting with the sound quality, on the Reckoning, Fables, and Life's Rich Pageant reissues, I was particularly struck by how much more vibrant the guitar sounded. With Document, it was the vocals that stood out to me as the most improved, seeming clearer and warmer. As with the previous re-releases, all of the instruments seem crisper and more clearly defined than in the original releases, but again, it is particularly Stipe's vocals that shine in this edition.<br /><br />The live concert included on the second disc is reason enough to buy this set and is one of the strongest bonus packages on an R.E.M. reissue yet. The concert venue is clearly a relatively small hall in Utrecht, Holland, and R.E.M. had not yet made strong inroads into Europe by 1987. As a result, the concert sounds much closer to the one on the Murmur reissue than it does to the later stadium-era days. You can even hear people in the crowd screaming for \\"Boxcars,\\" which confirms that Document remains fully rooted in R.E.M.'s earlier work, despite also being the gateway to a much larger audience. Of particular note is a beautiful slow rendition of \\"So. Central Rain\\" at the end of the concert. In all, the set is highly recommended and is a welcome continuation of the 25th anniversary re-releases. Please keep them coming!

0446580848|5.0|Years ago I read The Gold Coast by Nelson DeMille; I wasn't impressed. While an interesting story, I thought it was too long and too slow. Since then, friends have pushed more from DeMille. I resisted.<br />  Until now.<br />  I got my hands on DeMille's latest novel, The Panther. It is the latest in the John Corey/Kate Mayfield series. The short version of this review: I can't believe I've missed the first five in the series. I have a lot of catching up to do!<br />  Of course, I've never given the short version of anything, so here is the rest:<br />  John and Kate are married, both working on the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force in New York City. John is an NYPD Detective, Kate an FBI Special Agent. The story is told from mostly in the first person from the point of view of John, a smart, reflective, witty, pain in the ass. The same qualities that make him a good investigator make him difficult to get along with and even more difficult to supervise. That, of course, makes a great story!<br />  In The Panther, John and Kate are given an assignment in Yemen: to arrest the terrorist responsible for the attack on the USS Cole. Well, \\"arrest\\" might not be the most accurate way to describe what the team is really supposed to do, but that is the official assignment.  They've been specially selected, since the American born and raised Panther would like to \\"arrest\\" John and Kate, too, to avenge the death of an al Qaeda terrorist that they were responsible for. The two are working with agents from myriad intelligence agencies on this mission: military, State Department, the CIA. All are hardened and experienced patriots, and all have secret agendas that are slowly revealed throughout the book.<br /><br />  The book  includes loyalty, deception, betrayal, murder, and more, and that's just among the good guys!  Despite being over 6o0 pages, it is a page turner, helped along by fast dialogue and the laugh out loud wit of the protagonist.<br />  I don't know if was DeMille's intent, but I felt Corey's distrust and cynicism, along with the methods used on their Panther hunt, was a critique on the War on Terror, or at least the way it's being fought.<br />  The Panther is more about the story than the characters. John Corey is a New York cop, and narrates as one would expect from a New York cop. Although he has depth so far as recognizing the danger of the mission, and that there is a good chance he'll be killed, he isn't complex. He knows what he knows and doesn't seem to worry much about what he doesn't. Even the private moments between John and Kate are light. But the danger of the mission always looms, and even reading from the safety of my home I was tense waiting for the surprise attack, ambush, or explosion that I felt was imminent.<br /><br />  The Panther is an excellent book that I'm confident will return Nelson DeMille to the Best Seller list. His other John Corey books are now on my read list, and I've even considered giving The Gold Coast a second read, thinking there must be something I missed!tent, but I felt Corey's distrust and cynicism, along with the methods used on their Panther hunt, was a critique on the War on Terror, or at least the way it's being fought.<br />  The Panther is more about the story than the characters.

B007LNJ4YW|3.0|Teen Dream was a work of art. The band decided to go with the same sound as their previous cd but it didnt pay off as well for the listeners as the third cd perhaps. My favourite songs from this record are Myth, Wild and of course Lazuli.<br /><br />Irene does seem to add a dash of a flavour to the album but considering the fact that I'm always listening to Teen Dream, I find myself not getting the same exact feeling from Bloom. Maybe because only half of the music is just about as listenable where as Teen Dream had no weakness and even today I find myself fixating repeatedly on massive songs like real love, used to be, the wonderful zebra, silver soul, take care etc.<br /><br />I try to listen to a lot of new music in my ipad while doing other things but I find myself invariably coming back to Beach House.<br /><br />Bloom suffers from sounding a tad formulaic when you compare it to just how illustrious and wonderful Teen Dream was.<br />Nonetheless Beach House are the perfect band to do justice to a dim lit room to. They remain one of my favourite bands<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />I'd like to see different vocal ranges on their next cd and perhaps incorporation or a mix of new sounds to their next cd. I will be waiting...
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was so disappointed in this novel. I was expecting much more. It was very long, and I had to force myself to keep reading it ( because once I start a book I have to finish it). Toward the end it got a little exciting but that didn't make up for the rest of it.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|Walked to see this at the local cinema on opening night in a snowstorm in NYC's UWS. Avatar at the theater was in 2D. There was hardly a 3D scene. Should have asked for a refund. But 3D movies without 3D was the norm then a few years ago. And still is in many cases like Dredd 3D. An awful movie with the lure of 3D that did not exist in the theater's viewing room.<br /><br />Brother, this 3D version from Amazon rocks. The 3D is magnificent, stunning, breathtaking, awesome and any other compliment you can conjure up.<br /><br />This movie is eye candy. That is why I bought Avatar in 3D. WYSIWYG. And I got the best 3D experience ever. This ain't no Einsteinian flick but it is entertainment.<br /><br />This DVD is a strong case for never going to the cinema for 3D.<br /><br />Buy it. You have never Avatared like this.
B008RYN44U|5.0|I love this cd from No Doubt, it has a different sound to it, not like their old stuff, I've liked them since when I was in high school and liked their music all these years since they have been in the music industry, its got some great beats to it and I also love the ballads too. Its enjoyable that you can listen to over and over again without getting tired of it. I also recommend their old stuff too. Very entertaning as well. And Gwen Stefani still has a wonderful voice and the whole group has great talent as well. I recommend this one and their previous stuff to any music fan out there are any No Doubt fan as well. You won't be disappointed. Great Job No Doubt! I wish you the best of luck in the future to come, hope to hear more great music from you in the future as well. A+++++ for this album, No Doubt you rock!!!!!!!!

1609611543|4.0|The interesting thing about this book is it explained two things that I didn't have an explanation for before.<br /><br />First, I noticed that when traveling to Southeast Asia my appetite goes away so that I can easily get away with eating only 2 small meals a day.  Except out of habit I usually eat 3 times a day.  But I have eaten only twice in a day there on many occasions.  I eat mainly local food when I go and the starch is rice or rice based, even most noodles.  Anyway, I usually lose at least 5 pounds easily in 2 weeks and more if I'm there longer.  For years I've told people I thought I ate less because of the heat and humidity.  It was that noticeable how less hungry I was.<br /><br />Then just recently I had gone to the Philippines twice and actually gained a little weight even though I thought I was eating about the same portion sizes, and had the same activity level.  But looking back I definitely was eating lots of wheat products, even buying snacks to eat at night in the hotel.  I was puzzled about the weight gain versus loss until I read this book.<br /><br />The second unexplained thing is I found out at Thanksgiving a few years ago that I had gout, which some relatives have had.  My big toe felt like I stubbed it and some relatives asked if I had gout.  Which I didn't think I did, but had all the symptoms including very swollen joints in my feet.  Drinking tart cherry juice reversed that.  Gout is from an excess of uric acid in the blood.  When I was researching gout, I didn't find anything about the blood being slightly alkaline, just that cherry juice helped with gout.  Also the explanation was that eating too much meat along with other foods caused gout, without explaining why.<br /><br />This book explained that blood, and the body, is slightly alkaline and how most vegetables and other foods help maintain that, while meat, wheat, carbonated soda, and other foods result in more acidic blood, which the body tries to balance.  A little tart cherryjuice a day helped a lot with uric acid so I imagine other foods help with the body's ph as well.  Now that I'm eating much more vegetables, I don't drink cherry juice anymore and my foot joints are fine.<br /><br />I looked up both the glycemic claims and the acid/alkaline foods topic and found lots of information on the internet about individual foods.  The alkalinity of the blood would have been nice to know when researching gout.  I'd have started eating a lot more vegetables and cutting back on soda back then.  But I know now.<br /><br />Now for the results.  I've noticed that I do not have cravings for food now that I've cut wheat out.  Basically, like it is when I travel.  And I easily lost about 5 pounds in 2 weeks, although that rate of loss slowed down in the weeks after.  Probably because I have cheated some.  Had some pasta, pizza, a cheeseburger, some chow mein which has wheat noodles, fried chicken with wheat in the coating, a slice of pumpkin pie.  Probably other things as well.<br /><br />I have noticed that those days I eat wheat, even in small portions, I get the late night cravings like I used to.  Without wheat, I can go the whole night and until lunch time without feeling hungry.  Many days I just have coffee and water until lunch instead of coffee and some kind of breakfast.  Makes a big difference.  And while the book says people on average ate 440 fewer calories per day after cutting wheat, I probably have cut more out.  440 fewer calories works out about a pound difference every 8 days.  I had been gaining weight (about 15 pounds in 2 years), so the reversal and loss of about 7 pounds in a month means I've done maybe double that reduction in calories.<br /><br />The more time that goes by, the easier it is to avoid wheat, so I expect I'll start losing more weight faster.  Other than increasing vegetables, I have not done much other than trying to cut wheat out.  No increase in exercise, no trying to cut meat.  Just eating less food becausemy appetite has reduced.  But now that it has worked, I've started cutting other carbs.<br /><br />Jan 2014 update.  It has been almost 18 months and I've lost 30 pounds total, which took a bit under a year to get to.  I could probably lose another 10 pounds or so if I was more strict about adhering to the diet i the book, but I do eat french fries and more processed foods than recommended, like cereal and tortilla chips, though not wheat based things.  Still it is more carbs than suggested.  Overall, it has been easier to stay with this than I expected and is mainly due to the reduced cravings.  Without that, it would be very tough.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|this game was ok but its not that much fun because most of the time the coins fall off the edge.its one of those Im board games I guess ill play it...u know?
B000JLQSWE|5.0|I love this CD and it is on my itunes for the car. Super lyrics and very nice vocals make this one of my favorites.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I know, this had become a kind of cliche, but I'll do it anyway; I have one word to define this Wool Book, Wow! :-)<br /><br />I said, THIS BOOK, even though it is presented as a collection of 5 books in one volume (omnibus edition), because besides the first installment (a novella) none of the others can be considered without the remainders, and certainly cannot be read out of order. This was the way the author used to ask a small price for each part of the story and in the end, sell the book at a fair final price (in my opinion, an electronic book should cost no more than 1/3 of the cheapest printed edition).<br /><br />I don't have much to add to all the reviews already around and will only invite you to try the sample (and inevitably get hooked). It's a very entertaining story, well thought and well executed and a sure choice for Sci-Fi fans, especially those who prefer the less fantastic style.<br /><br />PS: I didn't understand the purpose (or even the meanings, lol) of the words (sayings?!?) at the beginning of each chapter on Wool 4...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I DEVOURED this book. I am a King fan in the first place, and he really delivered on this story. The classic King creepiness is still there, but this time with a historical theme that was absolutely riveting. As I neared the end, I started feeling sad because I did not want it to be over. This is one I will read over again soon. Don't miss it.
1400069289|5.0|This book is the best book I've read all year. A clever book that addresses a highly relevant topic for individuals, organizations, and societies with just the right mix of science, case study, and how-to practical application.<br /><br />The book is effective at taking on a journey of understanding habits. The first part of the book breaks down habits. What are they? How do they form? How can they change? This first part has a focus on the individual and forces you to start looking for and identifying the various habit loops in your life. As I was listening to the first chapter on audio, I was driving home from work. When I left the office I knew very well that I wasn't going straight home. I needed instead to go in an entirely different direction to teach a private class that night. Ironically, as I turned on the audio version of this book I clicked right into my habit and found myself outside my house before I realized that I had just lost an hour of time.<br /><br />It seemed to me that as I continued reading, the author added some of the other critical elements of habit formation by using organizations and then communities and societies as examples. This allows the reader to understand habits in a full perspective while at the same time learning their various applications in all arenas of life.<br /><br />Do you remember the last book you read that made you want to tell everyone you talked to about what you had just learned? This is one of those... be warned... or warn those around you because you won't be able to stop thinking and talking about habits and how they can change your life!<br /><br />NOTE: I read this book as part of the 12 Books Group; the largest online business and only author-led book group in the world.
B007RTAR64|5.0|I bought this barbie for my daughter,she's a huge fan of the movie 'The Hunger Games'. She absolutely loves it, and it's a Barbie product so the attention to detail is fantastic. Love it.
B0095T3H2U|1.0|This movie came highly recommended from one of my clients; she could not have been more wrong!! Not only did I lose the money for the cost of the movie, I wasted and hour and a half of my life. Notice that I said an hour and a half. I would have lost more, but I didn't watch the last 45 minutes or so of the movie. Do what I didn't, save your time and money by watching the trailer. That's where you'll see the best parts if the movie!!!!
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I REALLY LOVE THE MOVIE THE ONLY DOWNSIDE TO THE MOVIE IS THAT I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE TO IT LIKE HAVING THE GIRL GETTING TRAINED AND REALLY READY FOR THE BATTLE TO COME BACUASE WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU JUST CAN'T WAKE UP ONE DAY AND BE A WAR HERO! BUT OTHER THEN THAT I THINK IT'S A GOOD MOVIE! :)[[ASIN:B005LAIHSQ Snow White and the Huntsman (Two-Disc Combo Pack: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)]]
B005LAIHY0|1.0|***************************SPOILERS ALERT*********************************<br />I wasn't expecting more of Alien from Ridley Scott, but my expectations were high. However, instead, I was first greeted by grindingly simplistic (and repetitive) dialogue.<br /><br />The dialogue is not intelligent; it's stuff like, \\"What the hell is that?\\" and \\"I'll be damned\\". There isn't an actual hint of intelligence anywhere in the movie.<br /><br />IN ESSENCE, THIS MOVIE HAS NO SUBTLETY WHATSOEVER.<br /><br />Prometheus would be just as easy to understand with no dialogue at all. Everything that is blatantly obvious is made painfully obvious by exchanges like, \\"I'm going in.\\" \\"Copy that.\\" \\"I see lots of things in this room.\\" \\"Ok good.\\"<br />Throughout the entire movie, I felt like the script was written by a 5-year-old. Perhaps the same one who wrote Fast Five and some of the Underworld movies... Except this movie is far more bland, humorless, and self-infatuated than almost any other movie I can think of.<br /><br />Another contributor to the over-simplicity of this movie is the incredibly stupid, unbelievable characters doing incredibly stupid, unbelievable things in incredibly stupid, unbelievable situations. Scientists hugging hostile aliens, people running in a straight line when they should just walk 10 feet sideways to escape falling donut ships, a terminally ill Weyland going out to meet the mysterious hibernating alien man, Noomi trying to make the audience rage by telling people about her \\"faith\\" rather than real reasons for the expedition in the first place (not to mention yelling at the alien man about it)... Barf. Can something that makes partial sense PLEASE happen in this movie?<br /><br />SFX: Great, every single shot has tons of obvious and distracting CGI. This is the same problem that plagued the three new Star Wars movies: superfluous, useless CGI filling up every shot. What made Alien and other movies succeed is the extreme realism and ambience in the environment. Prometheus, unfortunately, went the Avatar route: all visuals with nothing of substance.<br /><br />Soundtrack: Boring, repetitive, overly ominous. I dislike listing to ominous, overbearing music when nothing interesting or thought-provoking is happening.<br /><br />Story: Completely inane and childish. No attention is even paid to science, or common sense for that matter. I know it has prevailing sci-fi themes, but the genre for this movie would be more aptly named \\"stupid fiction\\". There are just too many logical inconsistencies and holes here to be forgiven. E.g., there is no possible way Noomi should be sprinting away from ships so soon after she's had her abdominal wall cut open. It makes zero physiological sense. The whole movie makes no sense to a logical human brain, and there's no excuse for that.<br /><br />Characters: They suck. Or do they even exist? It's just a bunch of stupid, stereotypical characters who say stupid, stereotypical things. In this movie, people are basically just props for showcasing CGI. None of the characters are likeable except for some of the ship crew. Weyland is a stupid selfish dick, David is a mysteriously motivated dick for misleading everyone else (and he's a robot, making him harder to relate to), Vickers is cold and mean, and the scientists are clearly all stupid dicks. Noomi Rapace's character is just god-awful. She has an annoying accent, an unwavering moon face, and as she continues to muck up the situation for everyone else, her motivation is STRICTLY EMOTIONAL (*facepalm*). Janek, the empty black character, is easily the most likeable and realistic out of all of them.<br /><br />All in all, this is one of the worst sci-fi movies I've ever seen. Its only redeeming quality is good CGI, but that fact is easily crushed by the movie itself. I have great difficulty grasping what the writer, director, and actors were thinking when they made this steaming pile of self-infatuated garbage.

B005LVR6ZA|5.0|Dick's books usually shake me to the core.  Ubik  was no different.  One second you think you know what‘s up, then PKD tosses another curveball, then you try to process again, and he again slams you with some more craziness.  Ubik is a masterpiece of paranoid fantasy that only PKD could pen.  Read at your own peril.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a fun game to have on the kindle fire. I thank it a good way to waste time and have fun.
B005FISBTO|4.0|I love the show but this set does not have a clear picture.  I did not order blue-ray for the first 5 seasons but they were fine.  This sixth season is blurry, not high-definition. (Maybe its not such a good idea to see the gruesome scenes in great detail?)
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Awesome movie, may watch it again, though purely entertainment. Quality of pic could be better, though it is not HD, still this is not dial-up era.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I had my thoughts of what this book would be about but once again I was taken by surprise.  Such a good read that i couldn't put it down.  I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out.  I am going to make sure I pre-order.  This author has definitely got me hooked.
B007M45PMU|5.0|One of the best albums to come out of 2012.  I highly recommend the album and see them live if you ever get the chance!!!

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed each time I played. Something new every time. I'm looking forward to the next installment to see how the story continues and finding the old preacher and Hamilton.
0618526412|4.0|I am not sure why all the hype about this book. It is well written, but I certainly would not classify it as one of the classics.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great fun! I enjoy playing this game to kill time. good quality app. no glitches. no problems executing gameplay. &lt;3
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It pained my heart so much I just do not want anyone going through this like I have. It feels personal. Great read. Heart aching. I love and hate it all the way till the end. I miss the characters. Will never forget.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Utter rubbish! Pornography, very little story line, have read much better Erotica (if that is what this is supposed to be!). Will not purchase the follow-up books. Mrs Green
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Pretty cool -- beautiful graphics on the cut scenes / storyline especially. Like &quot;BeJeweled&quot;, but more to it. Great game -- thanks for offering it FAOTD.
B008X9Z3UC|3.0|I ordered this case because it was a good price.  I had a Case Logic zippered case for my old Kindle and thought they looked the same. Wrong.  This case is thinner, and not as rigid.  I didn't send it back strictly because I didn't want to pay for return shipping and shipping to order something else.  It's an alright case for the money, and I think my kindle is protected, but if I find a Case Logic one that will fit the new HD, I will be getting that one instead.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was great to see Judi Dench along with such a fine cast of actors! I absolutley loved all of them!!

B001VQF9N0|5.0|First Bib ever ordered so I have nothing to<br />compare it too, but these are a comfortable fit with a great chamois. I will be purchasing more in the future.
B00846REIS|2.0|This book does not rival Shades of Grey. I found it depressing and was not entertaining at all. There was really no story line, and too many repetative sex scenes.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Quaint characters giving an insight into the awkwardness of life in Ireland in the 70s. Comes with a nice twist at the end with the principal characters. However,being based around some factual material in regard to the \\"orphanage slave labour\\" system that prevailed under the Catholic Church in Ireland right through until disbanded in 1996, it certainly made you even more angry at the Church and how it has treated the faithful. A good read.
0143038583|4.0|I haven't quite finished the book, but I can already say that it is, without a doubt, an eye opening experience. I particularly like his idea of how corn evolved to live with humans instead humans breeding corn for their sole interest
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I tried this because my PC is located downstairs and I'm to lazy to walk down and turn it off, much better just to fire up Teamviewer and do it from the comfort of the couch.  This is a pretty simple and elegant product, it works and allows for complete control of the PC from a remote location.  I'd recommend it, it's free for non commercial use, doesn't take much space and really works.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|i bought this game for the very very steep $4.99 after becoming totally addicted to the free version and then running out of levels. i will usually not spend so much money on a game but this is one of the very best games i have on my kindle fire. the graphics are excellent and the music is great too. as are the sound effects. i am so tired of match-3 games that just make explosion sounds! also, the match-3 portion of fishdom is wonderful. it's very responsive with no lag, and you don't have to wait between moves for all the objects to finish falling to their next places. the little animations of the tiles are adorable, too.<br /><br />i have to say it is kind of hard to read some of the text (my eyesight is getting kind of bad as i grow older) but i can JUST manage to read it without putting on glasses. everything is kind of small because there's so much that has to fit in the screen, and sometimes my not-tiny fingers fumble and mess up a move, so thank goodness i'm not penalized. still, in spite of everything being teeny, i wouldn't even take away half a star, because this game is so good in every way that it more than makes up for it.<br /><br />i really never thought i'd enjoy stocking a virtual aquarium, but fishdom makes it so much fun. the fish are both beautiful and cute, and it is really fun playing the match-3 to earn virtual money to grant them their wishes. i don't know if this game will be fun forever, after all 3 aquariums are full, but i sure do hope it lasts a long time because it's not only fun and addictive, but very calming to play as well. i can't recommend this game enough to anyone looking for a superb match-3 game. now i can delete all the non-superb ones from my device, yay.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|I didn't see this movie at the theater so I was<br />waiting for it to arrive on PPV.<br /><br />Some have said this movie's role was to lay<br />the ground work for future Avenger's films - maybe.<br /><br />Most of the movie was boring \\"who is the super guy/gal?\\",<br />\\"why are they loners who don't play well with others?\\", etc.<br />Yawn.<br /><br />And while the last 20 minutes had great special effects,<br />too much time was spent giving the individual Avengers<br />screen time.  Other than Hulk, there was nothing in the<br />film that made me want see any of them again (especially<br />the next-to-worthless Agent Natasha Romanoff and the arrow-for-every-occasion,<br />Hawkeye).
B009GEPSDK|3.0|\\"The Tall Man\\" was a decent movie with an interesting plot twist (actually a twist within a twist).  The ending seemed confusing at first, but I think they did a good job of tying everything together.
B008HK3QII|5.0|I have owned several Timbuk2 products in the past and have always been happy.  This product is no exception.  The Kindle Fire HD fits well and the case is very attractive.  Highly recommended.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a fascinating story! You will fall in love with the Tiger and his antics. Keeps you interested in what happens next. You can almost feel the rolling of the waves, and the heat on the ocean! Can't wait for the movie to come out!
B008FSCNTK|1.0|I was looking forward to diana's new album, in fact I purchased both the regular and deluxe additions with a pre order. this is this first thing thats she's done that i just don't like. Hope she gets back to the standards and jazz,what she does best!
B0053O89KG|5.0|Intelligent, witty, sexy, humorous, twists and turns, great actors, characters evolve. My favourite TV show of all time. This season there are many issues and hurdles that must be over come.  Cops & robbers is an excellent episode and cuffed is my equal favourite.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|the worst app ive ever had!!! I wasted time on it its so slow and never loads pictures it takes forever its 100x worse than the mobile web twitter! waste of time!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I LOVE. this game! I didn't think much about it at first, but the more I played, the more I liked it. I now have it on my Kindle Fire, on my Xoom, and as of tonight, my phone. Just when I think I've got it figured out, I hit a level that stumps me. It's a nice break from flinging birds at pigs.
B002VH7P4O|3.0|Be careful with this. I was going to buy it until I realized that you cannot play 24-bit file on virtually every media player available.<br /><br />What you are, essentially, buying here is a Beatles collection hardwired onto a media player. You'll be able to play it from this media player, that the music is contained on, but you can't copy tracks to any other traditional media player and have it play - it won't recognize them.<br /><br />The sound quality may be great (I don't know), but the extreme limitation of having to carry this device around AND another media player for your other music files, makes it a DOA concept for me. I'm going to wait for media player technology to catch up on an affordable basis (seems there are $800 players that can handle it).
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Call of Atlantis doesn't break any boundaries or head into new territory, but it does provide a solid match-three puzzle game with a few minor logic puzzles thrown in to mix things up.
B0041C09Y0|5.0|I was looking for an action fix to hold me over until Breaking Bad Season 5 part 2 comes back, and boy did I ever find it! Very gritty & violent, characters believable.
B00932HEX2|3.0|I started this with great anticipation...but so many scenes seemed like something I'd seen before that I checked.  Yes! 'Homeland' is the US version of an Israeli show, 'Prisoners of War.'  The US protagonist is a conflation of two Israelis (in 'POW'), and his nemesis is a conflation of multiple characters.  It is a good US series, but it pales by comparison to the Israeli, which shows the government's basic skepticism and mistrust of its own returnees (who have been held so long--17 years--that most consider them dead and are shocked when they are returned).  In this version, they are traded for Palestinians who have killed many Israelis (restaurant/bus bombings) and so their own people are divided about the sacrifice the country made to get them back (remember, this is land of only 6 Million--everyone is loosely connected to everyone else).  The relationships in the Israeli version are at once far more subtle and yet clearer cut.  The Israeli version also only had ten episodes (5 in US Hulu 'run').  Running off into 'Manchurian Candidate' mode may save 'Homeland'--or not.  I also have to admit that making the female lead an overanxious, somewhat paranoid and perhaps psychotic woman (one character in the Israeli version goes transiently psychotic over her brother's 'death') seemed misogynistic and a 'stretch'--would an agency really keep a woman like her?<br />I'll wait and see how it plays out, but so far it seems another US version of a foreign movie/series which is doomed to be inferior to its original.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Just visited India this year for the first time.  It is mind-blowing, exotic, rich and extremely poor, full of excitement and a place for getting in touch with your soul.  Marigold Hotel is the best representation of reality and I loved every minute of it.  The acting is superb, the scenery is fabulous and the \\"heart\\" of the movie is like no other in a long, long time.  I bought the video because I plan to watch it over and over again. Every time I see something that I missed before!  Yes, it is about \\"mature\\" characters who each come to India for different reasons but it is a story for everyone.  We will all be there, if we are lucky!
B0097UO87U|3.0|Jeff Lynne delivered a 1-2 punch this month with [[ASIN:B008OJ291W Mr Blue Sky: The Very Best]], his collection of Electric Light Orchestra remakes, and this, his first solo album since 1990's excellent [[ASIN:B000008HZB Armchair Theatre]].  To say that this dedicated ELO/Jeff Lynne fan was disappointed would be an understatement. Over the years I've come to expect much from Lynne whether it was another in the string of solid ELO albums released between 1972 and 1986 or his numerous production gigs for George Harrison, Tom Petty, Paul McCartney, Julianna Raye, and `90s super-group The Traveling Wilburys (of which Lynne was a member).  For me the ELO remakes on \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" may benefit slightly from advances in recording technology but none of the one-man band performances measure up to the originals and \\"Long Wave\\" just doesn't measure up to \\"Armchair Theatre\\" or the majority of Lynne's post-ELO production outings.<br /><br />On this effort Lynne turns to some of his musical roots: classic standards which his parents listened to during his youth and several early rock classics. Lynne had covered two standards on 1990s \\"Armchair Theatre\\" - \\"Stormy Weather\\" and \\"September Song\\" - and each was given a rich, detailed arrangement and production. \\"Stormy Weather\\" even boasted a nice string chart with real strings. On \\"Long Wave\\" more than half of the songs could be classified as standards and while the collection starts out with the stunning cover of \\"She\\" (those harmonies brought a big smile to this face), the production style gets stale fairly quickly as there is little variety in terms of the arrangements for \\"If I Loved You\\", \\"Smile\\", \\"Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered\\", and \\"Love is a Many Splendored Thing\\".  It's similar to the style used for the standards on \\"Armchair\\" but without the attention to detail that made those two tracks so enjoyable. Also the two tracks on \\"Armchair\\" were surrounded by a variety of styles and approaches, a variety which is sadly lacking on \\"Long Wave\\". I also am beginning to side with those folks who have long criticized Jeff's piece-meal approach to recording/playing drums.  It is getting old and on several tracks (\\"If I Loved You\\" being the worst offender), the drums sound like they're just plodding along. I think many of these tracks would have benefitted had Jeff called in one of the many drummers he's worked with in the past: perhaps Wilbury's drummer Jim Keltner or Ringo Starr who even performed on Jeff's last \\"ELO\\" outing: [[ASIN:B00005KG66 Zoom]].<br /><br />There are also the early rock tracks - some, such as \\"So Sad\\", are better than others BUT I wish Jeff had gone a bit deeper on all of them to make them his own.  \\"Running Scared\\" is a fairly straight cover of fellow-Wilbury Roy Orbinson's classic single.  The arrangement very closely resembles that of Orbison's and I feel it would have been a stronger tribute to Roy if Jeff had brought something more of himself to the recording.  The cover of Chuck Berry's \\"Let It Rock\\" is the only number on this release where Jeff really opens things up (everything else is slow or mid-tempo) but at less than 2 minutes you feel it has hardly begun before it abruptly ends.  Jeff Lynne is the man who arranged a 7+ minute version of Berry's \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" in the early `70s and he couldn't stretch this one out to even two minutes? No, we don't need a 7-minute version but wouldn't it have been nice to get a Richard Tandy piano solo or Jeff on an extended guitar solo?<br /><br />And, of course, my last complaint is the strings.  I know Jeff grew tired of strings during the final years of ELO BUT if you're going to include strings in the arrangement at least use real strings.  Synth-strings sound thin and cheesy and take away from the quality of the recording.  Several of these numbers might have benefitted from the rich, warm, and organic sound of real strings.<br /><br />Bottom line? None of it is bad. In fact \\"She\\", \\"So Sad\\", \\"At Last\\", and a fewothers make the outing a must-hear for ELO/Jeff Lynne fans. But the lack of variety in terms of song-style, production, and arrangements makes this 27 minute CD seem much longer than it actually is. As a Jeff Lynne/ELO completest this collection will remain in my collection and get pulled out on occassion, however it is not one of those ELO/Lynne recordings that I couldn't stop listening to for weeks and weeks upon initial release.  I'm hopeful that his new collection of originals (rumored for release in 2013) will mark a return to form.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I listened to this recording several times while driving through New England recently.  It immediately caught my attention for several reasons.  First, I did not hear any synthesizers.  Second, the CD contains real liner notes, prepared by respected writers.  Third, the musicians, including Morrison on saxophone and piano, perform very well as a unit.  Indeed, when Morrison sings, he supports the band; not the opposite, which often is the case for vocalists who somehow dominate the instruments with their voices.  Finally, and this is a basic comment, the music just sounds real good.  It is enjoyable and well presented.  In short, this is, in my view, Morrison's best recording since \\"The Healing Game.\\"<br /><br />Three tracks stand out for different reasons.  While I highlight these tracks, this CD includes a collection of superior recordings.<br /><br />The best recording on the CD is \\"Goin' Down to Monte Carlo.\\"  It starts with rythmns that sound like pre-reggae Caribbean music.  The lyrics portray an intrigue with life in Southern France -- Nice and Monaco.  The messages reminded me of recent trips to this part of the world and the peace one can experience in this region at the right time of year.  Morrison sounds like he really enjoyed singing this song.  When he stops singing, this band leader lets the band take over. Much like a live performance, this studio recording departs from recent musical structures -- the musicians, with the support of their leader, individually display their talents.  Relieved of the threat of the synthesizer and the pressure of time limitations, these musicans show their craft with abandon -- they truly jam.  Their sound is sweet and cohesive, and it is wildly moving to hear the sound of a trombone in a modern jazz, R&B or pop recording.  As a ranking member of the global music community, Morrison, because of his status with the record label, made a wise election to dedicate over eight minutes to this track.  The sound is,  in totality, masterful.<br /><br />The first track is \\"Open the Door.\\"  This is a spirited song.  It was a good decision to make this the first track.  Simply put, it is a happy song about the writer's wish that someone open the door to her heart and soul.  When I heard it, I thought about similar pleas made by Morrison in his lyrical masterpiece \\"Wild Honey,\\" where he romantically proclaimed that his heart \\"beats just for you.\\"  In short, \\"Open the Door\\" is a light love song.  Unlike most love songs, it will not support a slow dance.  Its messages mirror Smokey Robinson's with a more upbeat tempo than those that characterize this Motown artist. It is not a slow jam.<br /><br />\\"If in Money We Trust\\" is a great musical arrangement.  It starts with a nice, delicate bass line.  The piano follows, and we then hear -- we enjoy -- the trombone sound again.  Morrison gives his band many opportunties to show their talents.  Like any leader, he steps aside and lets his team members show their talents.  This track features masterful brief saxophone, trombone and piano solos.  As noted above, the vocals accent the core music; the musicicans do not support the vocalist here.<br /><br />\\"If in Money We Trust\\" will generate some controversy.  I suspect many religious groups and some individuals will complain about lyrics that repeatedly ask, \\"Where's God?\\" (They would proclaim that God is everywhere.)  These folks also may complain that the statement -- \\"When God is dead\\" -- is not conceivable and never will occur.  Nevertheless, while the lyrics are distracting and may generate some controversy, the music -- the sound -- is tremendous.  Like track two -- \\"Goin' Down to Monte Carlo\\" -- this track runs over eight minutes.  While listening to it, I visualize Morrison actually stepping aside yielding to and genuinely appreciating the members of his band.<br /><br />\\"Close Enough for Jazz\\" basically is an instrumental arrangement.  It includes some lyrics that present like an afterthought.  This really is an arrangement that features the musicians.  Nice sounds.<br /><br />In closing, it has been years since I heard a vocal recording that genuinely featured the acoustic musicians.  As I reflect on this recording and the length of some of the tracks, I am reminded of the artistry of Isaac Hayes.  This musical legend often produced long tracks that featured the band and included his vocals only to reinforce the instrumental musicians.  I am delighted that this recording resurrected in my mind memories of great musicians like Robinson and Hayes.  Morrison ranks as a bona fide member of this class of distinguished musicians.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Full of unexpected twists- I couldn't put it down. Recommended for mystery and or novel fans. I plan to read more Flynn very soon.
B00746O3X8|5.0|This product is great.  I've only used it once and now I wouldn't want to head out without it.  It distributes the weight nicely for my Canon 7d with the 70-200 lens attached (carried in front) with my backup Xti with the 17-55 lens attached.  It definitely keeps the weight off my neck.  I was taking a few nature photos and was not doing a lot of switching back and forth but enough to know it made doing so much more convenient.  The quality is very good and I would highly recommend it. I was able to adjust the straps to make it fit me well (I am 5'2\\" and about 125 lbs).<br /><br />I like the idea that if I wanted to use either the front holster or side holster alone it is just a matter of either removing the side holster or using just that holster on a belt.<br /><br />Does anyone know if just the side holster is available as a stand alone product?  My husband seldom carries more than one camera and would like just the holster to attach to his belt.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book and look forward to the others. I just finished this one and it is awesome. Some people say its way to descriptive or that it's from a teens fantasy. Have you never had a sexual fantasy like this? I bet almost everyone has. E.L. James is a great writer and I love her books. She isn't afraid to put her fantasy on paper. I'm glad she did. I love these books and whoever says they hated them is out of their minds. How about you write your own book and see how hard it is to really write one??
B003UESJFG|5.0|I loved this movie!  I've watched it numerous times and every single time I see something cool (and mostly subtle) that I never noticed before.  The main character draws you in and makes you cheer for his efforts.  The movie even has a slight unexpected twist near the end. One of my favorite (if not my favorite) animated movies of all times!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I loved this book.  It is very internal which I adored - lots of what people are thinking versus how they are acting, their motives, how they view those around them and why (I would love to be - and a little scared of being! - JK Rowling's friend.  She is so perceptive!  I would constantly be wondering how she was assesing me, ha!).  Very well written.  I devoured this.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I finished all five books this evening and have been in a daze ever since. I am currently trying to read up every interview and relevant link about Hugh Howey in hopes of discovering more about this universe that he has created. (I have since bought First Shift).<br /><br />Hugh Howey has made a beautifully complex and compelling narrative about a world that takes hundreds of pages to even comprehend. What started as a simple novella in the beginning has twisted its way in to a modern sci-fi epic. His characters' stories are extremely well written and have you caring about every step they take in this bleak view of Earth's future.<br /><br />I am not sure what to write about the story without giving away any spoilers, but I can say that this Orwellian statement of our Earth's future is wonderfully dark, and I love how the backstory is weaved in throughout.<br /><br />Thank you Hugh.<br /><br />-Andy Stone
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I like very much bejeweled type of games. Bejeweled is a fun game, but it lacks a plot, a goal. I don't find myself achieving anything playing bejeweled. Although bejeweled 3 has some good improvements, they are not enough.<br /><br />Call of Atlantis is same type of game with a very good story line. Together with the beautiful visual effects, comforting music (if someone tells me the music is somewhat related to the historical story lines, it is a big plus), Call of Atlantis is a wonderful game!<br /><br />I would recommend it to any type of gamers.

0545091020|4.0|As I type this, I've already started in on the second book in this series via audiobook. It's a pretty entertaining series and I can see where Collins's work has had a particularly large influence on the dystopian genre as a whole. You can argue that there's better out there or more well known works, but this was exactly what such an under-noticed genre needed to fully push itself into mainstream notice, just as Twilight was what YA PNR/UF needed to gain traction.<br /><br />The basic premise here is actually pretty horrific for a teen/children's novel. You have a society that is constantly kept on the brink of starvation due to the seemingly selfish actions of an Orwellian government that is always watching for signs of rebellion. Despite there having been a potential mass extinction event, the world outside of the Districts is relatively full of life sustaining wild foods and game- which suggests that starvation could potentially be avoided if not for the Capitol's mandate that nobody stray outside of the walls. There was a rebellion, but it was squashed and in retaliation the Capitol essentially requires that every District send two children to the Hunger Games to fight each other semi-gladiator style for their amusement. The wealthier districts, the ones who can afford to train their children from birth and always seem to have enough to eat, don't mind this as much as the poorer districts who live day to day and enter the games emaciated- ensuring their defeat and deaths.<br /><br />It's into this type of world that we see Katniss, a girl who can't afford to be sentimental but is devoted to her family. She enters the games due to her love for her sister and ends up getting caught up in the various games the Capitol has to offer both in and out of the arena. Katniss is forced to agree to a rather twisted ploy for survival: to fake love with Peeta to gain support from various benefactors. This is actually fairly interesting, as many novels of this like would have her instantly falling for Peeta at first sight and there being obvious protestations of love from the get go. This might be spoilerish, but as there's tons of reviews of the book and movie commenting on their relationship I think that most will already be aware of the basic spoilers. Katniss takes a lot of convincing to even acknowledge what basic emotions she does feel, which I liked. The story in this first book isn't really about romance, it's about survival and personal freedoms first and foremost. It's obvious that romance will eventually become a main thrust of the series, but right here and now it's just having the groundwork laid for future love triangles and developments. I respect this, as most times you have the romance between the various characters be the central focus of the series, with anything else being there just to highlight how in \\"wub\\" the two main characters are. It's nice to have something that has the romance as something to accent a more major and more pressing plot point.<br /><br />This book isn't entirely perfect, mind you. There are points where the plot does seem to be a little overly extended and some readers will undoubtedly be frustrated with a general lack of detail about a lot of elements in the novel. As the book's focus is survival, we're given only what is most pertinent to the moment as far as back story goes for Panem in general. It makes sense that there wouldn't be gobs of info drops, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating at times. Having a little more description about how rough life is would make it more understanding to have someone around Katniss's age or the wonderfully tragic Rue's age act so mature. Their maturity is sometimes at odds with how they act, which both helps and hurts things. It reminds us that they're still kids but it'd also be good to show that these characters never had time to be kids.<br /><br />Ultimately though, this is a great book and the narration here is very well done. If you have a chance to listen to this as opposed to reading it, I highly recommend it. McCormick is pretty talented and I loved how she voiced Haymitch.nce to listen to this as opposed to reading it, I highly recommend it.

B008G8SFGO|5.0|This is great old school Kiss and I grew up listening to them in the mid 70's. I hated everything since they got rid of Ace and Peter - but gotta give this CD  its due - it SMOKES! Old school analog minimalist but wicked smart production and expertly executed. No bad songs on this disc. Don't care for the politics of Kiss -  but this album cannot be argued with -  well done boys! Now go get Ace and Peter back and end this trip well. (PS: T. Thayer is a GREAT player and a GREAT guy - just miss the real deal - Space Ace). BUY THIS CD if you love old Kiss. Well crafted songs and intentionally and warmly retro. 5 stars just for the throwback effort -which totally succeeds in my book.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Reminded me a lot of a John Greene book in the fact that it takes such a normal everyday occurrence such as the kid you know is a wallflower and turns it into a magical story reminding us they too have a life and trials and tribulations. Well written, gripping ploy line, and a twist that even though you see it coming you don't quite expect it when it gets there. Would definitely recommend.

B008YRVW0I|5.0|I have waited so long for the kindle edition of this game! It is my favorite to play to pass time:)
B001BANK32|5.0|My advice:<br />1. If you already watched the movie, read the book anyway! There are VERY big differences in the storyline, and the book explains many things that were a mystery in the movie. Probably the most interesting parts are the backstory of the hotel, such as the lady in the bathtub, and the life of Jack Torrance. Most importantly, dismiss any thoughts of having the book \\"spoiled\\" by the movie, because believe me the suspense will be there - because of the way it's written, and because the endings aren't the same! I found the book more frightening and suspenseful, truth be told, though the movie was amazing as well.<br />2. The beginning will be slow as the characters are introduced. Bear with it! A bit later on it becomes a lot faster and you'll be glad you didn't drop it at 15% or so.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|I love this album. I've been a huge fan of Bon-Jovi since i was 13. Having all my favorite songs in one album is priceless. Keep rocking it! I can't wait for the next one. ~ Carol

0375869026|5.0|My 10 year old reports that this is a remarkable book, and that readers of any genre will love it. Fans of realistic fiction will particularly like it. Great characters, interesting personalities, and the writing makes you want to keep reading. We had a nightly battle getting him to put it down, and he was excited to see how the story unfolded. A terrific and moving book; I was worried a bit about whether it was right for his age, but it obviously is. It was terrific to see him engage with a sophisticated and complex story a such a high level. We could not recommend this book any higher.
B006X08FDA|5.0|Many of the best songs of the CCD.  I can listen to it over and over. Lots of spoons and fun.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I had researched this movie before blind buying on release day.  No regrets what-so-ever.  I'm not a big Alien buff, but I do enjoy some good Sci-fi.  Despite the mixed reviews, I thought the movie was awesome and I was on edge until the credits rolled.  I put this movie up there with the best of this years movies.  Of course I'm still waiting to see Looper, but I've heard great things about that one as well.  Just take this movie for what it is, a sci-fi movie with some horror elements that ties into the Alien universe.  I will definitely be seeing the sequal.
B002BWP4A6|5.0|Even as a Bergman fan, I wasn't ready for a film this bleak. Yet, it was so stirring, astonishing, brave, and all so terribly inevitable. It's a window on traditional societies, a commentary on human weakness, and a compelling mystery. Perhaps it is a statement on the aristocratic notion that honor and paternal care are inherited virtues, perhaps it speaks to the Protestant notion that faith and not works is paramount. Both ideas are explored, and both turn out to be dust. Whatever it may be saying, it is very much worth seeing and considering.
B008M0NDOK|5.0|Slick controller w/ console quality gameplay- I take the gamepad with me and my Xbox now just lives a lonely life at home.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Fast action, almost too fast; I do not know why directors now a days give us stars, a good story, action; then speed it up for a quick ending. Then over leaving us with what happened? do I recommend this movie -yes would I pay big money to see at a theater definitely not. I'll wait till it gets to amazon and rent it. My two cents.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I debated about giving 2 or 3 stars. Settled on 3 because I did enjoy 2/3 of the of the book. Captivating concept. I did like Diana mostly in the beginning ( see skim comments)  ( note:I could barely get through book 1s of both Twilight and H. Potter.  )  Diana started out as an interesting person. The atmosphere of Oxford and the library was vividly described. Loved that.  But Ashmole the book? I had to re read the first pages literally 5 times.  Did I miss something? What was SO great and desired about that book? Diana had called it up before...Sean in the library brought it to her with no indication she had not asked for it or did not expect it.  And sensing its unique strangeness and hidden messages she just looked at the first few pages.  Took some notes and gave it back?  Completely illogical! She sent this amazing book back with nary a regret?so I never bought into the main basic premise of.this Book being All So Desired because Diana treated it so flippantly! And she had seemingly asked Sean fir it before so why didn't she ask for it again?? That was driving me nuts... did I miss something people??<br />So the importance and power of this mysterious book was glossed over and this is the whole being of the story!<br /><br />loved the library scenes and Diana's initial contacts with the Vamp.  I am the only reviewer who seemed to like the yoga scene albeit only the first time.  It was fun to imagine all.these spirits learning to be at peace with each other in yoga in this old house.  but second yoga class? Yawn....I was intrigued up until the scene where Diana made dinner for W the first time.  I'm a vegetarian with a pet rabbit and was not crazy about the rabbit dinner but OK. I got it. Vamp needs blood. But wait a minute! He did not drink tea with D on first ! !date. But now after the scene with his Scottish gay friend ( I did love that scene however!! W brooding over D. So gothic! ) and with D he suddenly DOES drink and even eats? Would have liked more info why he did not need blood. I was one of the few reviewers that did enjoy the wine descriptions! Wine old and sealed and mysterious like the vamp! Well not this vamp but the ones from stoker and rice...<br />after those interesting but holey sections the book devolved into boring boring hard to read boring!<br />Where was the scary animal blood thirst a crazed starved but in love vampire would threaten his maiden with? Where was Diana's brain and logic and born to mistrust vampires? Where was the Scottish friend ? A double date was in order ! And again why didn't Diana TRY to get that magical book again? Even by normal human means? Why didn't she berate herself for not keeping it!<br />So I started skimming. Skim skim skim.  I missed the magical house. Oh well.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Very will written and a wonderful read.  This book was something I looked forward to getting home to each day.  Cheryl Strayed has a lovely prose as she chronicles her journey up the PCT both the physical and emotional.  I would recommend this book to everyone, all could learn a lesson or two that would apply to their own lives.
034580404X|5.0|I heard from everyone at work how this was a must read.  I personally loved it. Kept my attention from Book 1 to Book 3. Well worth the money. Easy reading.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I usually read a book in 2-3 days. This one took me a week. I thought the book was boring until around 3/4 of the way through. More than once, I almost put it down. The last 1/4 was where all the action was, but by that time, I really didn't care that much. The last part of the book seemed rushed, where the first part dragged. I am amazed that people found this book a page turner. Glad I borrowed it from the library and didn't spend any money on it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Took a while to figure out how to move pieces. Once I did I really like it.  Some great artwork too.
B004MMEF30|5.0|I've seen many Sherlock Holmes movies over the years, with a few of them based on this book.  I did a quick look online and found that there have been at least 24 film adapations of this novel.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and plan on reading many other of Doyle's novels about Sherlock Holmes.  Highly recommended.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I would reccomend this game to people who just want a fun and addicting game. the reason I got it is because it was free app of the day and I figured that I couldn't go wrong with it so I got it and now I cant stop playing.

1932735410|5.0|Used this book to study for PMP exam and passed, no problem. The book covers everything you need to know for the exam. Study a chapter per night, do the exams at the end of the chapter, and practice writing your brain dump. Go through the book a few times and you'll do fine. Be aware that there's no fluff in this book - if the information is in the book, it's likely on the exam as well. So read well, memorize definitions, be comfortable with your inputs/outputs (i didn't have these memorized, but I knew material well enough that I could figure them out as needed). Know the book forward, backward, and upside down and you'll do well. The test isn't hard if you know your stuff, but it is tiring so be sure to create a brain dump of the knowledge area process grid & your functions during your tutorial time before the test starts. Good luck!
B007THA4FI|5.0|What a great read!  While the premise of the book (the multi-faceted relationships between folks in a small town) has been done before, this one is set in a small village in England, which lends it an entirely different feel.  J. K. Rowlings continues to write beautifully, with some lines so finely sculpted you want to go back and read them a second and third time. You get the impression that Ms. Rowlings knows life in a small town intimately, with all the ugliness and pettyness that that entails.  The many characters are very well developed, but you find yourself wanting to read on to learn even more about them.  Looking forward to what she comes up with next!
B001VZY4M8|5.0|There are so many great tunes on this album, that it's difficult to pick out a favorite! If you're planning a long vacation drive in your car, bring along any and all of your Neil Young CD's and enjoy the ride. Great cruising music!

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I really love the story itself. I couldn't put the book down, but if I had to read Ana say something about her inner goddess one more time, I was going to throw the freaking book against the wall. I also got tired of the over use of smirking, lip biting, and eye rolling, but the inner goddess thing was driving me nuts. Mr. Grey's hand would have fallen off if he had to punish me for every time I rolled my eyes at that saying.  I am reading the second book now and the goddess thing continues, grrrr. Sometimes the book seemed like a cross between Pretty Woman and Twilight (in a sense). I could pick out a few lines in the book that seemed to have been said in the movie \\"Pretty Woman\\".
B003EXY1WS|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold never disappoints. Each album shows the great talents of these individuals. If you like this album, get the rest. Each album has a unique sound and expression.

The orchestra under Maestros Levine and Luisi is almost as good as being there to hear it live, which I will never be able to do.  Congratulations to the producers of this memorable work!

B00005V9IL|4.0|This is a good movie that I enjoy watching on occasion. It has some good special effects and is generally an entertaining movie to watch. There are two different endings to the movie. I haven't received the DVD yet so I'm a little unsure which one this has. It says that it offers an option for an additional 28 minutes of footage which I think is the long drawn out version about thwarting an apocalypse which got a bit ridiculous and I did not like at all. I'm hoping the original theatrical version is the one with the shorter and more simple ending.
B0098VXE50|4.0|I liked it,good speical effects.Great action,drama and romance a little bit of everything.I found the movie to be very entertaining.
B00123KDMO|5.0|I was really into VH when I was growing up, and bought every album as soon as it came out. That all ended when they released the crappy 1984 album. Fair Warning has always been one of my favorites, but I hadn't listened to it for years. It simply rocks like the VH that I grew up listening to, none of the 1984 crap.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Fun game, challenging puzzles, interesting storyline can't wait for the sequel! For anyone who likes puzzles games, I would highly recommend this game.
B003B17YZE|5.0|Hendrix - a true cool natural musician who lived in every moment...a wild, uninhibited beautiful player of the universe...a singer and songwriter with a guitar style that remains dominant to this day. Electric Ladyland has wild wah wah, the whammy bar, backwards tracks, ferocious guitar sounds and solos, bluesy-spacey beauty and other overwhelming moments. This is the \\"master-at-work.\\" I know Watchtower is overplayed but so what. It defined what a cover tune could be when you play it like you own it. Stick in those ear buds and let Jimi take you to the other side of the sky. :)
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Nice variation to a jewel match game! Could be more challenging but at least there was a change from just matching!
B0002DKCMG|4.0|You can't ask for much more in a comedy. I rate it along the lines of the early American Pie movies. It has a lot of off the wall humor and hilarious scenes. Definitely go with the Unrated version if you are a guy. The other versions edit out some of the eye candy.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|I felt that this MI did not live up to the other's.The movie just was missing something,maybe because it seemed to drag from action to action!I realy enjoyed the last three sequels.The stunts were breathtaking, leaveing you on the edge.MI-4 may have been just one to many sequels,it wasn't bad but it sure wasn't great!
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|My daughter loves tinkerbell!!  The movie quality is perfect and download time was quick.  Plus, the rental price was low.  No need to purchase the entire movie for a short day trip.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful story and characters. Grabs your interest right away and it is hard to put the book down. Can't wait to read the next book.
B006FE83UE|4.0|The DVD comes with Digital Copy and a free gift. I was disapointed because I was not allowed to download the digital copy as I resides in Malaysia. As for the free gift, I was not entitle to it as I am residing in Malaysia. Why is it so?
B009RI4FRU|3.0|The product (the Amazon Online Movie rental) was as usual: few hiccups here and there, such as moments of blurriness and stops/starts, but overall the rental played well.<br />As to the movie itself.... It's obvious that it was intended to be quirky. And it was, along with some laugh-out-loud moments, moving scenes that bring back fun childhood memories no matter what decade one grew up in, mixed with some truly bizarre situations, some of which are too far fetched to be believable. All-in-all it was entertaining just to see the oddity of it. Something totally different than the usual Hollywood offerings. If you want a bit of lighthearted and unusual entertainment for a rainy afternoon, this is your movie.<br />For those that are concerned with the content (warning: some may feel this should be given a spoiler alert, so here you go): Some foul language: I think 2 or 3 that I noticed (I think there was 1 SOB, and 1 or 2 D-words, and one JesusC). Only one 'big' fight scene of two boys struggling with one being punched in the sides, lasts for only a moment as the aim in that scene is not to fight each other. Views showing/dialog of weapons, none of which you see actually being used - although you see the after affects of two of them (bloody craft scissors, and an injured/dead animal). One 'make-out' scene that while was innocent enough in the acting, the dialog pertaining to it was adult in nature, something parents might not feel comfortable having their own children hear being discussed.
0316228532|1.0|Before I start my review, I want to make it clear that I only read 25 pages of this book (and it took me 5 days to even get that far because it wasn't keeping my interest). I also want to make it clear that in my life I have not finished about 6 books and this is one of them.<br /><br />The book starts off with a death at the beginning. Then we get to see a lot of the characters reacting to this death in very different ways which could be interesting, I guess.  It does take a long time for the news to even spread.  Quite frankly the characters are boring, vanilla and not all that original. There is no plot to speak of. If there is no interesting plot or unique characters, what is supposed to keep me reading this book? I know - it says J.K. Rowling on the cover. I think that does this book a huge disservice. J.K. Rowling is not even her real name. Mrs. Rowling does not have a middle name in real life. I feel like the only reason the publisher put the same pen name that graces the Harry Potter books on this book is so people like me who LOVE Harry Potter will buy it. They are different genres - they NEED different pen names. But that's just my small opinion. I'm having a hard time reconciling the person who wrote the fun, quirky, complex and immensely entertaining children's book with the person who wrote this very adult book. They don't even seem like the same person to me. I wrote as an update while reading this that this book is kind of ruining Harry Potter for me. If I finished this book, I might not look at Harry Potter the same again.<br /><br />I tried to plow through the zero plot and boring characters, but I found myself not enjoying the writing, either.  The writing wasn't bad, but I didn't find it immensely interesting either. I heard this was supposed to be funny. I guess I didn't get far enough to see the funny parts. But there are characters who are married named Barry and Mary. Maybe that was supposed to be funny?  Overall, this book was just not for me.  J.K. Rowling rocks and I will love her forever.  Whatever else she writes, I will read.  Sadly, I just had to skip this one. The massive amounts of vulgarity and constant talk of sex was a huge turn-off for me.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I like using Facebook to see what my friends are up to and let them know what I am up to but there are toooo many game apps that people send.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|match the squares by swapping them out - gets tougher as you go along the levels - very cool though
B007THA4FI|5.0|As a teacher of English literature, I'm thrilled by The Casual Vacancy. The characters are rich and captivating. The story is intricate and honest. I can't wait to invite my students and colleagues to explore their own reality mirrored in this monumental literary triumph. Do yourself a favor, and allow the truth of Rowling's masterpiece to pierce the thick wall of your existence.
B007STBUHI|4.0|I was disappointed as I was not allowed to download the Digital Copy + Ultraviolet.<br />Tried to go to website but was informed that I do not qualify as I lived in Malaysia.<br />Why it is so? By the way, I bought Jaws (DVD + Digital copy + Ultraviolet-Universal's 100th Anniversary)
B0060D3BWK|5.0|This is my absolute favorite Halloween Disney movie!! I first saw this in when i was 7 or 8 n i still love it to this day!  this classic witch movie will never get old! two thumbs up!
B004Y6MU6S|5.0|This book has no week spots for me. Never a dull moment, the action is riveting, the characters are so well developed. I genuinely cared about all of the characters and was truly inspired by some. This book made me feel every emotion. Probably my new favorite book and I can't wait for the next one!!!!
1600242405|4.0|Great listen but a little too long.  He could have cut out some of the details about his friends.  I bought this new but CD 17 had quite a few skips.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love this game! The graphics are fab and the music is not annoying. The developers did an awesome job! So glad I down loaded this, &amp; can't believe I got it free  :-) Thank you for making this available.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I was a little hesitant because I wanted this DVD to be clear and concise.  From the great packaging to an easy open wrapping I was so surpised and happy.  I will be a consistent customer because you have given me great quality.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a great take on an old classic. I love what you guys have done with this version. It takes a little more planning than before.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I'm holding out for the \\"Totally-Greedy Avatar Anniversary-Edition 32-Disc 3D BD/DVD Combo exclusive diamond platinum gold silver bronze rock paper scissors ultimate limited extended special definitive remastered collector's director's cut w/lossless audio, UltraViolet digital copies, CD soundtracks, notepads, post-its, coasters, and a shot glass.\\"<br /><br />Thank you very much!<br /><br />P.S.

B008XG1X18|4.0|I mostly get on Pinterest mobilely and prefer my Kindle view over my phone! Easily pops to web. Very easy to view &amp; use.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|coin dozer is alot of fun you don't want to put it down, BE patient the coins will drop!!! play your coins wisely
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I like this 2-cd pack a lot.  I put it on in the car and sometimes leave it for three weeks or more.  Anyone who likes Leonard Cohen knows how easy he is to listen to over and over.  Great love songs.
B00942Y6WI|5.0|I prefered to listen to the audiobook until I couldn't keep track of the characters anymore no matter how many times I tried and then I saw the movie. Definitely read or listen to the book though - a lot is left out of the movie.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|This first episode makes up for all the foot dragging in the second season. I just am really disappointed they got Hershel. The zombie apocalypse just ain't good for senior citizens.
B00457X7XQ|4.0|If you like computers and and international intriuge - you'll probably like this book. The charachters were engaging and the story line had plenty of excitement!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I recommend it for anyone looking for action and insight to the Special Ops world. It has revived my reading desire that has been lacking.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this game is very frustrating....but that's what makes it addictive.  I believe I will be playing this game for a long time in the future!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very skilled writing.  This was a real page turner.  Everyone in my book club loved it, though there  were different opinions on the ending.  Most didn't like it.
B00417HV14|5.0|This DVD was beyond my expectations, then some.  Clearly half of the selections were original material which sounded like old standards played masterfully.  Very well done, indeed.<br />jerry
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app there are a few things that I'd add llike the &quot;back to the top&quot; button that stays permanently visible... I hare scrolling alllllllll the way back to the top... but I'm glad there's an App now instead of just the web page for Kindle, the web page was horrible for the kindle. Over all I love it!!!!!
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Some great songs, sets and costuming that bring back lots of memories (dating myself here). However, this movie is tainted by horrible casting, some really terrible song choices that can barely be considered \\"rock\\", and acting that makes \\"Glee\\" look Oscar-caliber. Adam Shankman just really needs to stop trying to be a director and stick to choreography, which he is great at. For the age group he was shooting for, this was all wrong; the dialogue and direction was for tweens while the subject matter and cultural/historical references were clearly for 30-40 somethings.<br /><br />Julianna Hough's nasally voice is more suited to country than rock and while I have the utmost respect for Mary J's voice, her character was just not necessary. Diego Boneta was far too \\"pretty\\" to work in this role and Tom Cruise was...Tom Cruise with fake tattoos. The only characters I actually believed in their roles were Russell Brand, Malin Akerman and Paul Giamatti. Unfortunately, their efforts were wasted on this poor excuse for a film. Glad I rented it for free...would have been pissed if I had actually paid $4 for it.
0345803485|5.0|This book kept you wanting to read more.  Couldn't wait to read what was going to happen next.  Really makes you think about your own sex life.  Some of it sounds to be unrealistic but that's why it's a book. Can't wait for book 4 to come out.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works great. Just plug in Kindle and wall outlet and it charges your Kindle. Could not be easier. You can continue to use the Kindle while charging.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|A great addition to any Walking Dead fans collection. Looks great. Screwdriver acts like a key to the head case.
B008OURHPY|5.0|This album is soulful, quirky, emotional, beautiful! Lianne has an interesting voice and writes great lyrics. I love something about every song on the album! Her cover of He Loves Me is an interesting take, rhythm wise. Very nice album.
B007QXU0ZO|2.0|I bought this on the strength ot two songs, \\"home\\" and \\"man on fire\\".  Found the CD very monotonous with a heavy christian bent that I neither anticipated nor desired. Listened to it three times and that is probably going to be it.
B004BC7MRM|4.0|It's a song. If you like the artist, you'll like it. If you don't like the artist you won't like it. Not much else needs to be said
B007TK77QE|4.0|I like her writing style. Very descriptive and I really enjoyed the book as the characters slowly revealed themselves. The story had to end somewhere but I found the ending a little disappointing. It seemed to wrap everything up too quickly. Perhaps I wanted more, did not want the book to end!
0756686970|4.0|I purchased this book for my son for his 4th birthday. He loves it. Great gift. HE loves the pictures. The only problem is he wants all the guys in the book. Oh well.
B001AACEP8|5.0|great debut album and it's $5,come on!i've been wanting to buy this album for so long.and now it's on sale,great great great!cant complain
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This is a great series with lots of twists but you have to start from season 1 to really get into it.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|I played this for about a week, spent $3.99 on more hearts, and it worked great for one day. The next day, the hearts were gone, and the hired helpers were gone. I had to contact amazon for a refund. No help or advice as to what happened. Fun game, though.
B005NPCJ88|4.0|It's a song. If you like the artist, you'll like it. If you don't like the artist you won't like it. Not much else needs to be said
B000L3CHC0|2.0|It's a good looking watch, but it came with some of the hands misaligned. Did some searching and it turns out it's a problem more common than I would've thought. Beware!<br /><br />Luckily Amazon has a great return policy :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the book. I can't wait to read the final book.    I recommend this book to everyone. great book.
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|saw part of the movie, late one night after work. did not get the pleasure of finishing it because my time window allotted expired. not in love with amazon's foray into the PPV movie world. Netflix Never gave me grief. wish I could say more.

0316010669|4.0|This book is worth the read if you a fan of Malcolm Gladwells writing/thinking style.  I believe people too often compare this book to [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]] and are therefore disappointed in this title. However, it's a different book with a different spin on how we think vs. how we feel.  The main point to the book is that too much information can cloud your judgment and make it difficult or impossible to make the correct choice.  Rather, we are often better served by listening to our intuition.  I saw that other reviewers were pointing out flaws in his \\"proof\\" or pointing out that there could be other variables at play.  Yes, of COURSE.  However, the fact that there are other variables is exactly the point.  The variables are endless and sometimes it's better to go with a \\"Blink\\" decision.  Ultimately, like explained in [[ASIN:0985923202 something like God: Six Weeks to Spirituality]], there is a greater power \\"out there\\" in the universe, and by tapping into it, we can sometimes make better and quicker choices. Heck, if it's the \\"wrong\\" choice, at least now you can adjust your path as opposed to always wondering \\"what if\\" for the rest of your life.  :)
B007SGM084|3.0|not what I expected. it was boring. the same scenes over and over. last book I skipped pages just to get to some kind of story.not worth 30 bucks.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Somewhat disappointed with this book.  I have read other books by Albom that were exciting and held your attention. The time keeper was typical, did not have a different plot and was predictable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|great ideas from food to crafts and home projects! I can save them all in one great place for review anytime.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I like this game, it is fun and challenging. I haven't had any issues so far. Great graphics as well. Keep it up
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I've been playing Fishdom and Fishdom 2 on my PC so when I saw that Playrix was offering the FAOTD I know it would be good. There are seven \\"ancient lands\\" to work your way through and each land has 8 levels. The first seven are match 3 games and the 8th is what I think they are calling the hidden object puzzle. It is not the traditional hidden object game as you don't have to find the object. Rather you place the artifacts you collect, while playing match three, into their proper places in a picture. They circle the place where it is to go so it's basically just going through the motions. That doesn't take away from the game though. The match threes get more difficult with each round and include obstacles you have to navigate around to drop the pieces of artifacts off the bottom of the board. Once you have droped all the pieces of the artifact the round is over. You are also racing against the clock, but you get plenty of power ups along the way. Save them as you will need them when it gets really difficult.<br /><br />I was wondering about the \\"endless replay value\\" so I played all the way to the end to see what would happen. The game just ends, but if you start over again the play is a little different than the first time. Extra obstacles and other things are added and you don't get the history all over again. All in all, this is an excellent app but I'm not sure about the $4.99 price tag. I suggest you try the free version before plunking down your money. I tried the free version of Fishdom and was happy to fork over $4.99 for the full version. So I guess it's personal taste.<br /><br />Works well on my Kindle Fire.
B001NLKS16|3.0|I was expecting alittle more info on the Winchester's and not so much on incantations and invocations. Too many references to articles and past lore.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This is an excellent case for the kindle fire. The strap keeps the cover closed when needed or even helps hold the cover back when you're using the Fire. It is not to bulky or unsightly. Just perfect.
0545265355|3.0|I purchased this boxed set as a gift and wanted the hard cover book version rather than the paperback version.<br /><br />The books in this set are \\"hard covered\\" but I was somewhat disappointed because (in my opinion) they are not the same quality as the book we got when we checked out \\"The Hunger Games\\" book at our local library.<br /><br />The library book had a more sturdy front and back cover plus the pages of the book appeared to be of a better quality.  The library book was just like I expected a book would be.<br /><br />The books in this boxed set are \\"hard cover\\" but the covers are not as \\"sturdy\\" as the above metioned library book.  Plus the pages in this boxed set appear to have paper that is thinner than the libray edition.  As I turn the pages of the books in in this boxed set, I feel like I have to be especially careful for fear of putting a \\"bend\\" in the page.
144234430X|1.0|This story is for a M3, I guess. It is not playable on a CD player thus can' be used in your car. I don't know about the content because I can't listen to it. What a waste of money. I wish that the item descriptions were accurate and helpful. Watch out for the rip-off. (55)
B008AT71WI|5.0|Well, 26 years after it was made, I've FINALLY seen one of my all-time favorite movies for the first time. Little Shop of Horrors. The REAL version, not the sappy happy ending version. Earlier this month Warner Home Entertainment released it on DVD and Blu-ray with the original, darker ending restored. It is amazing. I never realized just how cheesy the theatrical ending was until I saw this version. And yeah, I'd seen the low-quality black and white version of the ending from the recalled DVD, but seeing it not only in color, not only in high-def, but actually cut back into the movie is just amazing. And since I've seen the theatrical version so many times growing up (so much that I wore my old VHS out entirely) that I could spot when the only change was a different camera angle. This was the greatest thing I've seen in AGES.
055357342X|5.0|Purchased this book, Volume 3 in the Game of Thrones series, as a surprise gift for someone who was just finishing Volume 2. It arrived just in time and was well-received.
0525953728|3.0|The interest of the book is hampered by the national security filters. About two thirds of the book have nothing to do with the title.
B009FZZK8I|5.0|I have to say that i love this show, and this clip did not dissapoint.  I am looking forward to Season 3 very much and this was a good look into it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|wow its in alpha guys....which means still updating so don't be stupid by saying OH THERES NO JOCKEYS OR CAVESPIDERS. Those things will come in later updates dumbsh*t so just wait :L
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Fantastic book for all of us wallflowers, past and present! Cant wait to read it again. I cant wait to see the movie as well.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Love this show and was happy to get the dvd at a good price just in time before the new season started.  Good job Amazon!!!
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I bought this microphone just in case my wireless ones crap out (its nice to have a backup). Behringer continues to impress me with their products, I have now built another mobile DJ system using only that brand and I AM IMPRESSED. Not an expensive microphone but comparable to the Shure SM58 at a fraction of the cost. Do the research and you will be pleased.<br /><br />DJTOM66
B0055EAJ7A|4.0|Received the item as described.  Packaging kept it nice and safe except one corner was slightly bent on the cardboard outter box.  Other than that it was great.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love it reading it again.  You must get the whole set.  I'm not a big reader, but all my friends were reading the books.  I couldn't  put it down.
B004EPZ084|3.0|There was a lot of promise and hope with a star cast but the writing never delivered among it's comedic star cast. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis could have been the three musketeers of comedy but they play three best friends from childhood who get together and talk about their horrible insufferable bosses. Kevin Spacey plays Jason Bateman's cruel boss. Julie Bowen has a small part of Spacey's unfaithful wife. Jamie Fox even has a small forgettable part as a hired killer who turns out not to be one after all.<br /><br />Really, the big surprise but not really was Jennifer Aniston who played the predatory dentist on Charlie Day's character. She wants him for sexual pleasure but he's engaged. She makes his life hell in the office and goes after him but you wonder why. Jason Sudeikis's boss never really developed to be as horrible because he had the fewest scenes.<br /><br />The DVD has a seven deleted scenes but not much else to watch on the side and not even the making of the film itself. While this comedy will show up on television, the DVD offered little to compensate. The film is a mediocre comedy with a dark side and not much light there too. I think the film could have been a lot better with first rate writing.
B008BO61BE|5.0|A proper reissue that does not sound like it is part of the loudness wars. The Video as expected is also excellent. Together this package is well worth the money.
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|I enjoyed most of the movie.  However, the casting for the part of Snow White lowered the quality of this production.
B009FZZFME|5.0|This is a great series and having it streamed through Amazon is no different of an experience.  I want to buy the 3rd season but wanted to try this first, and it did not dissapoint.
B0012CH350|5.0|I purchased this grill to give me that wonderful charcoal flavor when not usuing the gas grill.  I have had several Weber charcoal grills before but none with the ash catcher on the bottom.  I can't tell you how great it is to have that small can on the bottom to catch all those ashes.  That was the only thing I hated about my previous Webers.  Problem solved!  Thanks Weber!<br /><br />  I also purchased the premium cover, go ahead and splurge, it's nicer than the economy...
B000002O3I|5.0|I had to mention Howlin' Wolf in my upcoming book because the heroine Ana Corelli who grew up in Italy but is of African American and Italian heritage is just discovering the blues and one cannot study the blues without listening to Howlin' Wolf.  His gutbucket style just snatches you up in a sensual spell and makes you want to grab your man and hold on for a while.  Admit it, the blues can be very sexy.  Put this CD on the next time you're setting the mood for romance and you'll see what I mean.  :o)
B008BDZOZY|5.0|When I initially heard about this album, I thought, \\"nifty,\\" followed by \\"that could REALLY work,\\" followed shortly thereafter by \\"I NEED THIS ALBUM NOW.\\"  I've not been disappointed. This album starts great on a first listen, and just keeps getting better with each new visit. These two artists weave amazing sounds together, with Annie's vocals and usually snarling guitar striking resonances with Mr. Byrne's syncopations and horns.  Their voices click, their melodies click, and the album is a wonderful synthesis of their talents.  This is one that has been on repeat for many days, and I don't see switching it up anytime soon!
0525953728|5.0|Great book to have in your library, reading it will get you closer to what really happened during that incredible military raid. Many of us that went thru military service will get remounted to our past service and past missions. I recommend it to everyone that really wants to understand into what conditions military members go thru in an effort to serve Freedom.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|There is MUCH less to this movie than meets the eye.<br /><br />Wooden dialogue. Wooden acting. Uninteresting characters. A well-worn plot, with zero surprises. A perfunctory 'ending.'<br /><br />As is often the case with a Ridley Scott movie, it is a triumph of style over content -- except that the style is now as shop-worn and predictable as the plot.<br /><br />Judging by this effort -- where any viewer with a mental age approaching double digits is far ahead of every predictable turn of the plot -- Ridley Scott is now running on empty.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Great album with great songs. Love Train and their music. High energy content at concerts. Their songs and content are from the heart and real world experiences.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|The best thing about the book is that it reiterates what I already know... that if you want something you have to work toward it.<br />That's been my experience... but sometimes you forget.<br />Maybe not the most brilliant writer, but his main thrust is what's important. He tells you how it has worked for him time and time again and how he has taught the approach to others.<br />Excellent book for anyone who needs a little reminder and a push in the right direction.
B008AVYOBC|5.0|GREAT TO GET ALL THE VIDEOS. NOTHING NEW AS FAR AS MUSIC GOES. STILL I WOULD RECCOMEND. WORTH EVERY DOLLAR.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Lots of action, lots of banter among charactors. Fun effects, hey a flying aircraft carrier thats invisable. I look forward to more.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This was a good game. It keeps me entertained on my kindle. I got the free version and it is very fun.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is the most accurate of the different weather apps and is SO easy to use!  I love it and use it daily!
0385344333|5.0|I've read all of the Reacher novels, from stem to stern.  I don't get all the whining about this one.  Each and every one is a gem in its own right.  Every time, I think he won't be able to top THIS one, but the next one doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />I REALLY liked this book.  I was absorbed from the start.  The time in the car didn't seem tedious to me, it was creepily atmospheric.  I can't imagine anything worse than hopping in a car with strangers, and then gradually realizing they are dangerous sorts and that I am at risk.  The tension just builds and builds until it's palpably taut.<br /><br />It's Reacher at his finest.  Just trying to mind his own business, until he's drawn into a situation that he doesn't start, but is called to finish.<br /><br />Oh, and btw, he didn't seriously threaten a child.  Please!!  He used a mini-version of the same paradoxical psychology he uses with adults, in order to dial down conflicts and get a job done.<br /><br />I had no doubt this is Lee Child, in fact a maturing Lee Child.  I think \\"A Wanted Man\\" is a terrific addition to the series.<br /><br />I also think Tom Cruise will burn in hell for trying to play Reacher.  Cruise was ridiculous enough in \\"Mission: Impossible\\".  So, now we get what?  \\"Mission: Reacher\\"?  The trailer made me want to barf.  The \\"ever-car-hating\\" Reacher spinning in a fancy sports car??  Really?? Can't Tom read?
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I felt the first book in series was very abrupt and a bit alarming for me. But I did enjoy it and I enjoyed the series as a whole better than just book one on its own. I plan to read them again, this time I won't be shocked by what comes next!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|MY Sister's Keeper has to be just about the best book I have ever read! It was inspiring and thoughtful. Jodi Picoult is obviously a seasoned writer that knows what she's doing. I can't wait to read more of her incredible work. I highly recommend this book to everyone. Grab some tissues and start reading... you'll be up all night!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Excellent. game play. I own the full version. of this. game and was very pleasantly. surprised. by the converted. application. to the smaller. size. A great game at home and on the go.

B003BWERF8|5.0|I use this on my Nano with a watchband, it is unobtrusive and works great. The device \\"paired\\" easily the first time.
1451696191|5.0|Perks of Being A Wallflower was an exceptional book that I found amazing every moment. The book tackles real issues that lead the main character, Charlie, further on his journey, even if they're sad. The story revolves around a boy who is in high school who becomes friends with seniors, Sam and Patrick, who do things like sex, drugs, and alcohol which causes many problems for the character. Perks of Being a Wallflower is realistic because it shows what growing up and trying different things is like, and how that could lead to consequences in a negative or positive way. I liked this book because of the realistic way it depicts teens and their risky life choices, and its beautiful storyline made it impossible to dislike. This book has been one of the most popular books in the season and is sure to be remembered as a classic for a long time to come because of its realistic story and the connections it makes between what teens in our society do in now and things the characters did in the book. I would give this book two thumbs up!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app because it gives you so many diffrent melody's and sounds that you choose for your mood. Mix any sounds together and make it your own, great for just relaxing and clearing your mind. I highly recommend this app.
B005K17RU0|5.0|every morning when I wake up check this out to see what the weathers going to be like.its so ebay and convenient.
B003L20ICE|1.0|i was looking forward to seeing this movie and it turns out to be the worse movie that i have ever seen
B005LAIHRC|1.0|I was so exited about this movie, and it is so bad ..... think hair-metal bands meets \\" GREASE \\", this is one stupid, stupid movie . I HATE MUSICALS ! They are constantly breaking into songs, (and ruining them). I guess if You like GLEE, or GREASE, and you like hair-metal songs sung in a pop way by teenage girls, go nuts ! ( otherwise, watch ROCK STAR or THE ROCKER, or AIRHEADS !
0446573027|5.0|Just finished it last night. It was a great book from first to last page. Another hard to put down book once you start reading.
1439127700|4.0|The President's Club would make a nice addition to anyone's library or collection on the presidency, especially the cold war presidents.  Most interesting is the surprising close relations between some of the presidents who were at one time bitter political rivals, such as Ford and Carter or Bush 41 and Clinton.  Also it is an eyeopening read of the relations of Richard Nixon with Johnson, Ford, Reagan, Bush 41, and Clinton.  This a book very much worth your time.
B0018Q4DTY|5.0|One of the great pure hip hop albums.  Not like that garbage today.  The story telling abilities of these two gentlemen rivals that of the great Slick Rick.  The lost art of actually having something to say beyond lets get drunk and party and look at my chains and rims is evident in this album.  If your tired of the trash you hear on the radio and want something that you actually LISTEN to,  then Outkasts sophmore album ATLiens is for you.
1452101248|5.0|This has become our new \\"go-to\\" cookbook. Everything we've tried has come out well and we've had great success using substitutions for rare ingredients. The results look exactly like the pictures and are extremely presentable. The flavors and ingredient combinations are a pleasant change and are inspiring cravings for vegetables. This is well worth the money.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is very well written.  It is a realistic portrayal of the life of a SEAL and the details of the mission.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Used this for 2 years now and will never go back to stock key board. i like the custom options.
B0090NNQX6|5.0|I've been a Mika fan since his first album and have been anticipating this release for some time. On my first couple listens I liked it but didn't love it--- I was not sure about the more polished sound of the album, if that makes sense. His first two albums sounded much more distinctive and seemed to let his personality through more.<br /><br />A couple songs on Origin Of Love initially caught my ear though (specifically 'Stardust' and 'Emily') so I kept listening to the whole album and after a few more spins I'm completely hooked. There are no clunkers here at all (his first albums each have a track or two I can do without) and despite the extra layer of studio gloss, once I gave the songs a proper listen the Mika I knew from his earlier work is still there. Whew! His sense of humor is intact and he's in excellent voice throughout.<br /><br />The fun uptempo numbers will get the most attention, but for my money 'Heroes' is the most affecting (and brave) song he's done since 'Happy Ending' from his first album. If I had to make a criticism, juxtaposing 'Heroes' with 'Celebrate' is a slightly jarring way to end the album--- Ending with 'Heroes' would have been a bit depressing and it definitely has that \\"this is the heavy last song on the album\\" vibe. Pairing it with 'Celebrate' is a tonal 180 switch.<br /><br />I strongly suggest getting one of the extended versions of Origin Of Love. The added tracks are all very good in their own ways, but 'Tah Dah' is superb! It should have been on the album proper as it's no cast-off b-side.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|I have always enjoyed the music of Diana Krall, because of her originality and because I feel that it is bringing something different and important to the modern Jazz. However in this case I feel disappointed and hope that Diana will partner with musicians that strengthen it and boost her career by the highest.<br />Last night after listened to Diana on this new album, I heard the Take a Look of Natalie Cole, and the things there were like night and day... Natalie looks best and takes meeting Diana. It is not the best album of Diana.
B005LAIHRC|1.0|Yet another musical that recycles 1970's & '80's pop songs.  In this case the movie and most of the songs are bad.  Also most of the musical numbers are thrown in without any reason.  I wanted to like this movie but nothing about it is good - sets, costumes, locations are dirty &/or dark.  The plot is the one about reformers vs. rockers, with no likable characters.  The 2 young romantic leads are cute, but the story is such cliche, that the actors & audience become numb within 1/2 hour into the movie.  There is a number with Alec Baldwin & Russell Brand that tries to be campy but comes across as tired & pointless.  This has all been done before & done better.  Mary J Blige tries but is overwhelmed by the ridiculous stereotypical character she plays - a retread of the Cher character in the equally bad Burlesque.  Most of the rest of the cast is wasted.  Save your money & time.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|a great story line, a great game. would reccomend you play it. a great way to kill time. got my brother addicted too.
B000L1RC90|5.0|The Number of the Beast was one of ten cd's released as double disc versions, the second discs containing the b-sides of their singles, and ALL of these (the first 10 albums)are worth every dollar I spent on purchasing the entire set!  Any TRUE fan, if you can afford it, should seek these out as they are becoming rarer and are truly an awesome document of the bands \\"other\\" material.  Thank you Maiden for all of the years' worth of material you have provided us fans with and I truly hope to have many more!  Up The Irons!
B007JMW46U|5.0|I started reading these stories after catching up with BBC's Sherlock (a show I fell in love with). I wasn't sure I'd like the stories themselves as much, but it turns out I do. The first time I picked up a Sherlock Holmes story, I was much too young and couldn't get into them. As an adult, I appreciate the sarcasm and wit in the characters and can grasp the period dialogue and situations better. These \\"Adventures\\" stories are short enough to pick up and book down whenever I need something to read, but long enough to feel complete. A very pleasant collection.
B003H9MSPG|2.0|This Nerf gun should be called The Catapult, because that's the angle you need to shoot to get a dart across the room. My kids have Nerf pistols that shoot twice as far.  Don't bother with this one.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|I have used it before, and its amazing.<br />I rest my phone and now I can't open it.<br />Force closed every time
B009QW7HMC|5.0|Non-stop action and great special effects. Going into a prison was pure genius. We get a new character and all the returning characters are somewhat different from last season. Carl is a bad ass and Daryl is now second in command. Hersel aged quite a bit. Rick is no longer bonding with his wife and Carol is horny for Daryl. Glen and Maggie continue their romance. Can't wait until episode #2 - more new characters and more of the fabulous Prison set. Please do more with T-Dog. There is potential there and his role in the group has always been on the back burner.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't usually write book reviews but this is by far my favorite book. You'll laugh, you'll cry! Definitely a must read. :)
B009EHDU7U|4.0|This book has it all: comedy, drama, action, suspense and even romance!  I look forward to reading Jonas Jonasson's next novel.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|you quickly go through coins and have to pay for more. although it can be fun to play , its the idea of paying more.
B001VZY4M8|5.0|First bought this album in high school when it came out.  Bought CD version when it came out.  Accidentally went over ten yrs without listening to it, then pulled up some of the tracks on you tube and almost cried because hearing the songs was just as wonderful as the first time I'd heard them.  Went to the local record shop and immediately picked up a new vinyl copy!
B00066VUPM|5.0|I don't know a lot about Travis before purchasing this, but had heard &#34;Why Does it Always Rain on Me&#34; and liked it.  Turns out  that it not the only one I enjoyed, was pleasantly surprized by the entire cd.  Very Very Good!
B00006FR47|5.0|I love Chicago's music and this was no exception. There were some old songs and some new ones for Chicago.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|One of the finest productions I have had the pleasure to view. Have watched it completely thru three times and each time learn more about my country. This epic level production introduced me to an American patriot family and president that before I had given little thought to and has Inspired me with more appreciation for the events which lead to the \\"birth of a new America\\" and too continued academic and historic research on American Independence.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|the game is entertaining.  the only complaint I gave it was that the coins are too slow to generate.  which means you play for 5 minutes then you have to wait 6 hours to get enough coins to play again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Simply amazing i am addicted and cannot wait to read the next two books. By far the best read i have had in awhile.
B0054JELS4|3.0|I love this show. The DVD's came quickly and we have enjoyed watching them. Unfortunately, after the three month return window closed, we opened season seven to find that four DVD's are missing. Please check that ALL disc's are there before you have this same problem.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|Office Soace is an instant classic, and a cult favorite.  Anyone who's ever had a boss that says, \\"I'm going to need you to go ahead and. . .\\"  knows why.  For cubicle rats everywhere!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Great matching game. Hasn't gotten old yet. Works well with Droid incredible 2. No problems or crashes. Worth the money for sure
B000FSME1A|5.0|I wanted a collector´s movie and I found it in it. Packaging and content are coherent at all. It satisfied fully my expectations.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|very relaxing after a stressful day at work. easy and enjoyable without having to over think what needed to be done.
0790729393|5.0|I first saw this film when it came out and have rewatched it many times. It is a timeless story that resonates even today. The performances are all amazing and even though it is sometimes painful to watch, it's worth seeing over and over again. I heartily recommend this film.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I am a giant fan of pinterest...like spend hours at a time on it. I've seemed to see a lot of issues with this app though in that it freezes and forces it to close nearly every time I use it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is by far the best keyboard for Android! I absolutely love it and lucky for me I got it when it was free
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|fun app to play.  if you like games such as bejewled you will like this game plus it has a little bit more to offer
B006ATJXQW|2.0|After the trilogy this was extremely disappointing. The story line was far too slow-moving and lacked substance. I found myself bored 1/3 of the way through and forced myself to finish it thinking it would get better. Unfortunately that didn't happen.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|I loved this season even though it was shortened. There are 4 more episodes yet to be released. I can't wait! I am a bones fanatic.
B005LAIGWS|2.0|The,product was delivered as promised  and on time.  The movie sucked.  It had very little plot and the action scenes were dragged out and the CG was bad.
B004GJYROG|5.0|We have been looking for this movie for a long time. We got it for a good price, we love it. my kids love it too I have 4 kids and kept their attention the whole time
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Difficult to get into. Once I figured out all the characters the story got better and better.  He is a little bit wordy.<br />Now... I can't wait to see where it goes
B002SW8Y2E|5.0|\\"Amazon Verified Purchase\\"<br /><br />Child 44 is a tour de force; an excellent read which leaves the reader wondering what will happen next.<br />The research into Russian Bureaucracy and Oversight is impelling. Author Tom Rob Smith had done a first class job in combining historical fact with spine chilling fiction.  Stalin's excesses and paranoia are well known and this book highlights the terror under which most Russians lived. Highly recommended, I am now reading the sequel.
B00000K31Q|5.0|This DVD arrived earlier than expected which is always a plus. It played well and there were hardly any scratches so it was like it was brand new. I was very satisfied.
0316228532|5.0|As with most others, I had to calm my inner craving for more Harry Potter and try to move on.  After I was able to do that, I was impressed and was able to enjoy A Casual Vacancy.<br />This is truly a \\"big book about a small town,\\" just as billed.  I was constantly reminded of Peyton Place, as others were, and was impressed at JK's ability to develop characters with depth and truth.  I found it to be a piece that really shows how well intentioned people can be blinded to what is happening in their own backyard.<br />Is it happy? No.  Is it gripping with suspense? No.  But who told us to expect that.  What JK did give us is true to life characters, a good story, and a well written novel.<br />I was particularly struck by her ability to grasp teenage perspective, which is often attempted and very rarely successful.  I was also amazed at her insight into how disadvantaged and troubled families can view social workers.  I work as a mental health professional, who has had jobs very similar to one in the novel, and I found the characters reactions to her to be spot on.  When she mentioned social workers visiting with their many \\"folders\\" I heard similar comments directly out of my own client's mouths!  She also highlighted the constant revolving door of workers that are charged with working with these families and the toll that takes on them. (I was also surprised that this reality seems to be true both in the US and in Britain.)  I plan to use certain parts of this book in my work.<br />I was pleased and would certainly recommend this book to others.  Not to fill the hole left for Harry, but as a novel that delves into the reality of how blind we can be to what is so clearly in front of us.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game has the enjoyment of typical match games in the convenient form of a tablet game.  Graphics are easily viewed,  the storyline is entertaining,  and I could easily find myself playing this for hours.

B006KX3GXO|5.0|I have tried various photo apps out there. My favorite are PicSay Pro, Pixlr-o-matic, Paper Camer, Pencil Camera and this one! I think for a free app this one is the most comprehensive and has the best features. Let me briefly tell you a little about why I love this app, I won't bore you with a run down of every single feature.<br /><br />-Color splash and Color replace: It is surprisingly difficult to find an app that does this. Color splash is where you have a black and white pic with a little color accent. I've found apps where you can draw your color, but not one this good. Also, color replace is phenomenal. You can choose a color in the picture to replace with another color. The soccer field in my daughters games has been known to transform into pink for a few laughs and I changed one of my dresses from pink to blue just to see how it'd look. It's pretty awesome! The color splash can be done via the camera in the app also, not just in a picture that's already been taken.<br /><br />-Effects: There are tons and tons of great effects available. I love the cartoonizer, watercolor, neon, and popart effects! There's also a great red eye fix, blemish fix, teeth whitener and suntan adder.<br /><br />-Edit: This is where you can add fun effects like text boxes, stickers, clipart, more photos, neat frames and borders.<br /><br />-Collage: This is just fun and I'm glad this app has it integrated. I was using a separate app for collages, which I've since deleted and am exclusively using this app for them. Tons of cool collage frames or make your own.<br /><br />-Draw: If you've wanted to draw on your picture this is kind of fun. My daughter likes it.<br /><br />-View other peoples pics: Kind of a instagram style thing where you can check out other peoples creations.<br /><br />My only few gripes are: #1 There's no paid version. I love this enough that I would invest a few bucks in getting rid of the adds. #2 At times it can be a little confusing to navigate through, but worth the effort. In my opinion this takes the best of all the  photo apps and combines them for a great comprehensive app. It's not as easy to use because of the mass amount of features, but it's really amazing when you take the time to explore the features.orth the effort.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Just finished my third time reading. Just as the last two times, I just can‘t put it down even knowing what happens next.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Now thanks to this show I am convinced that the old man with motocycle that moved in across the street snitched on his club and is in witness protection.  I am also a lot nicer to dirty, hairy white guys and old tired looking cranked out biatches (just in case they are someone's \\"old lady\\").  These woods are gangsta!  Oh, and Clay looks like a dayum Neanderthal, but Jax can get it.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was finally going to read a J.K. Rowling book, but was somewhat disappointed. This book is kind of boring!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I'm always skeptical of match3 games because they get boring quickly and the reviews always seem skewed or faked. Not the case here. This is actually very entertaining. Well worth the asking price even if it wasn't free today.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great game if you are a fan of match 3 and many different levels. Also gives you history of each place
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Like all Rhonda Byrne's book, this is a great one as usual! Always nice to read and with awesome exercises. Love it.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This is one of the better games I have played as far as game play and all. The one down fall I see is once you start to get into the game you run out of energy so you either have to wait 2.5 min per 1 or go and pay for some and I really didn't want to have to spend anymore money for games this early starting.
B0091THRCU|2.0|The idea behind this pouch is good. The form factor is nice and the iPhone 5 fits nice and snug as advertised.<br /><br />Unfortunately the stitching unraveled within 48 hours of opening the package. Rather than an iPhone pouch, I'm left with two pieces of fake leather.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i like this game but there are better games out there. i liked it because it is more than one game for free...................
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good sequel to the first book, i wanted to read it before it came out in theateres so i would know what to expect
B006H5120E|5.0|This was the most awesome 3D movie for the home. I sat through the whole thing and it was much different than it was in 2D. Get this movie if you have a 3D TV. You will not regret it!
B005VPRDAY|3.0|My daughter was happy with the legos but I was disappointed. Buying a \\"bucket\\" of legos. I would have expected alot more legos not a bunch a little pieces that can only be used as flower tips. What ever happened to being able to buy legos and create a different structure everytime. Now you buyild it once and most pieces can be used again.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was a great book. It kept you wanting more. Such a page Turner. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good book.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|I love this show! Haven't quite finished season 4 yet, but it's definitely good. Lots going on and very action packed and addicting.

B0088RQ4TI|2.0|It was really bad. I heard it wasn't good but thought maybe the reviews were exaggerated. They aren't. The original books are so much better.
B003B02OOG|3.0|Buy \\"The Last Juror\\" and \\"The Rainmaker\\" you`ll read them over and over. Also, \\"The Testament\\" Great rainy day novels.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Tense,credible, great characters, can't wait for season 2. Watching the whole season over a couple of days is the way to go. This is a must see.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Ok, I admit it.  I was an 80's party girl and loved the big hair metal bands of that era.  Lord, those were great times!!!  I had heard so many negative things about this movie that I didn't go to the theater to see it.  I primarily bought it when it came out on dvd because I DO love 80's music, brings back sooo many great memories.  I really had no high expectations where this movie was concerned, and I must admit I was curious how Tom Cruise would carry off the part of a Rock Star.  His character's look intrigued me enough that I thought, what the heck, I'll get the damn movie.  If it stinks, I can always donate it!<br /><br />If you're expecting something along the lines of \\"South Pacific\\", \\"Oklahoma\\" or even \\"Chicago\\", keep looking, because this movie isn't it.  The story's been told before many times.  Small town girl heads to L.A. with stars in her eyes and big dreams in her head.  She loses her record collection, finds a job, loses her innocence, finds love, loses love, finds it again, etc., etc.  The Bourbon Club is under the threat of being shut down by religious fanatics for playing devil music, etc., etc.  It's the ol' overcoming challenges type of movie.  There is not a lot of substance to it.  But, you know what?.... That's OK, because this movie is so much FUN to watch!  I LOVED it for that reason alone.<br /><br />I can take or leave Tom Cruise.  He's made some outstanding movies, but that's because they were really good movies, i.e., good plot, good cast, good special F/X, etc.  I was sooo riveted watching his performance as Stacee Jaxx.  He nailed it!  He was amazing.  I saw a sexuality to him I didn't think existed and I was blown away.  I didn't \\"see\\" Tom Cruise, I saw an aging rock star in an alcohol induced haze trying hard to stay on top.  His singing was actually quite good and he moved and danced around on stage as though he were an actual rock star putting on a concert.  He impressed the hell out of me in this movie.<br /><br />While not a huge Alec Baldwin or Russell Brand fan, these two were delightful to watch as Dennis, the owner of The Bourbon and his right hand man Lonny.  Their duet is priceless!!  Who knew Alec Baldwin could sing?  Very passable.  The rest of the cast turned in laudable performances as well, Julianne Hough, Diego Boneta, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Paul Giamatti, Mary J. Blige.  Some of the songs were a blend of two different popular 80's songs sung at the same time, and and they were fabulous pairings. I really enjoyed \\"dueling\\" songs.<br /><br />You know every song that's being sung, hell, you'll sing right along with them.  Come on, admit it, you even remember all of the air guitar riffs and licks, and the awesome air drum solos to all these songs! Because I do.  I think my husband thought I was having seizures at first due to my antics, but when he was assured that I did not in fact require medical attention, he sat down and enjoyed the movie too.  So, watch this movie for the sheer enjoyment of what's on the screen and the pleasurable walk down memory lane.  Watch it strictly for entertainment purposes only.  DO NOT try to find any deep, thought provoking, life changing or profound storytelling here, you'll be sadly disappointed.  So, park your brain at the door, crank up the volume, sing along, and just enjoy!<br /><br />It's a guilty pleasure, so ROCK ON!!!  Now, where did I put that mousse and extra super hold hairspray?<br /><br />~ jade ~
B004CA8YK2|5.0|I am not really a major fan of Mr. West but this album is a monster hands down. Add this to your collection.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Pretty interesting and novel magic systems as well as well developed characters in my opinion. It was a page turner for me and I'm excited to see how the story unfolds.
B000P512LQ|4.0|Breakout performance for Edward Norton-Had everything! I read the book before seeing the movie and it followed pretty well. I still was shocked at the ending. Gere was very good and Linney was great.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Mark Owen and Kevin Maurer get major kudos for such a thoughtfully and carefully scripted honest account of one of the most incredible military missions ever.  A moving account, sprinkled with moments of real humor and stories of true dedication, brotherhood and comraderie, No Easy Day was a true joy to read.  I would highly encourage every American...whether you know someone in any branch of the armed forces, have a unique pride in our nation and the principles on which she stands, or someone seeking the truth on how one of the most significant elements of the War on Terror was finally resolved...this is one book you must read!  The book reads fairly quick...well worth the investment!
B002VWNID6|1.0|I have never had a movie recorded on both sides of the DVD.  You can imagine my dismay while watching the movie only to have it end half way through.  My husband turned the DVD over and sure enough, the second half was on the other side of the DVD.  If I would have know that I would never have purchased this DVD.  Very disappointing.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I got this album at a promotional price and I am glad I did. I had, of course, heard &#34;Somebody That I Used to Know&#34; but didn't know anything else about Gotye.  The album is not all like that song.  I always listen to an album at least twice before I decide whether I like it or not and that is what I did here, but I took a liking to it from the first listen through.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have played this game on my computer and really enjoyed it.  I was really glad to see the app today.  Now I can play it anywhere.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have enjoyed a game like this on our Pc and I am. glad it has a version for androids. now I can play it whenever and wherever I like to kill some time. it is a pleasant way to pass the time. it has no glitches so far I.e. it runs smoothly. for beginners in this game instructions are easy to follow. graphics great.<br /><br />/
B002APU580|5.0|This is one of my Favorite Movies. If you like Period Romantic movies, this is wonderful !!!<br />I've seen the BBC mini-series, which is good, but I like this movie even more.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|I got this album at a promotional price and I am glad I got it.  I had to listen to it a few times before I grew to like it, though.  The very first track is weird but several of the other songs are pretty good.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Love the game. Very addictive and challenging. The hints are very hard to accumulate. You are directed to get hints on facebook but no hints are offered on the FB page.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|The writing is poor, the characters are cliché, so I waited until the first erotic scenes to see what all the fuss is about, but also these are really below expectations.
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|Hints need to be able to be disabled. The checkbox in options does nothing.<br /><br />Will add stars if hints can be disabled.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|I bought this album at a promotional price and I am glad I did.  I like &#34;Brothers&#34; better, but this is a good album.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|The detail that went into this product was nothing short of impressive on many standards. The material is high quality and the collectable nature fit my desires to a T. The delivery service was also very punctual and helpful. I am more than satisfied.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|its really fun. its somewhat easy and good. u enjoy it and cant stop playing. u get prizes and some times do puzzles. its fun adicting and a really great game
B008J34466|5.0|Pink never stops surprising me! At first i thought blow me wasnt typical her,but after i heard the song a few more times, well she was back! Im not a big fan of ballades but the great escape is a beautiful song. Im a little dissapointed with eminem intervention on the song here comes the weekend, his lyrics arent what im used to,but is deff a party song.<br />I love Pink and this album has very touching songs, very funny songs and most of all,all of them are very Pink :)
B007BZM3HK|4.0|This is a fun, peppy song.  Sure, it's a bit vapid, but that's all good.  If you haven't watched the music video, I recommend you doing so.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Another excellent game by Playrix! I love the opportunity to EARN the money to make my purchases!  A breath of fresh air from having to use money I don't have to buy money. Superb graphics, though decorations could be a bit more colorfulimages. I dread running out of levels as that will end the game for me as I don't have money to buy the game!
0525953728|4.0|Under the pseudonym Mark Owen, this newly retired Navy SEAL, member of SEAL Team Six among other elite groups represented by acronyms, writes of the intense and specific training and development of the most elite forces in the world. Although No Easy Day is presented as the actual account of the killing of Osama bin Laden, it is so much more. To this group of specialized fighing men the actual operation which resulted in bin Laden's death was no more or less typical in preparation and training than other rescues or kill orders. The only thing that separated the mission from others was the extreme secrecy and selection of individual SEAL team members and the resulting execution of orders within the borders of Pakistan where bin Laden lived apparently unhampered.<br /><br />The first chapter sets the stage for the dangerous situation confronting the Chalk One group as they approach the target compound. Leaving the reader on the precipice of danger, the account then moves to the training for other missions and the graduations of levels for SEALs to get to yet another specialized group. If nothing else, these next chapters reveal the hearts and souls of \\"the brotherhood\\" of extremely talented, courageous, and team-oriented men called to be SEALs. Those whose philosophy and motto is \\"The only easy day was yesterday.\\" repeatedly train and go on unique missions. Train and go on unique missions. Over and over again. Always in the \\"readiness\\" and combat state of mind, these men only know \\"vacation\\" in an abbreviated form. Giving additional credit to Army Rangers and Delta Force in this book, the reader realizes these soldiers are special, elite, brave, multi-talented, and every other form of superlative that could be applied to those who do the most dangerous missions, the dirty work under the radar, the hidden things that keep our nation safe. They deserve all the acclaim and notoriety that accompanies the moniker Navy SEAL and Special Forces, but they prefer anonymity.<br /><br />What provoked the inherent risks and the inspiration for No Easy Day were the multiple incorrect accounts of what really happened on the mission which resulted in the death of al Qaeda terrorist Osama bin Laden, known to them as UBL. Not only was the government responsible for publicizing incorrect information but also, of course, the media claimed to have the inside story. Mark Owen decided to expose some of the false reports and give a general and careful reckoning of the events preceding and involving the death of bin Laden.<br /><br />Accompanied in the writing of this novel by Kevin Maurer, the author of four books about Special Forces who spent many years embedded with the Special Forces in Afghanistan, the account reads as smoothly as a story even without the contractions in the dialogue. It's well told and good reading.<br /><br />My only complaint is the use of and tribute to \\"luck\\". Luck had nothing to do with some of the amazing occurrences noted in this book.<br /><br />Most of the proceeds from No Easy Day will go to honor the fallen and the families of slain SEALs lost since 9/11 listed in the final pages of the book.<br /><br />Buy it. Read it. For them./><br />What provoked the inherent risks and the inspiration for No Easy Day were the multiple incorrect accounts of what really happened on the mission which resulted in the death of al Qaeda terrorist Osama bin Laden, known to them as UBL.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book is as good as they say. It's well written and very intriguing! I would highly suggest this for anyone who has an open mind and wants a good read!
B008H6GH8I|4.0|Okay, so I've read the books and played the games, and without a doubt love the franchise. For those of you who relate to that, I don't need to tell you how pissed I was after seeing the first live action movie. \\"What the hell is an Alice?!\\" I said to my mother. Each subsequent film has only served to stir up a combination of deep resentment and confusion. What did I do to deserve this, Screengems?<br /><br />All that said, I happened to stop at my local Redbox just to see what was new, when I saw RE: Damnation. I thought, \\"S**t! That better be Alice-less!\\"; It was! It has all of the elements that you'd expect from the game; that does include many of the cliches associated with the genre. The graphics were beautiful (with the exception of a perspective issue on one of the characters, but that's neither here nor there). Leonissuperfoxy, ehem. It felt like more than just video game cinemas edited together, unlike some others that I've seen. It is my hope... No, my greatest hope that the current live action franchise spontaneously combusts, and the team responsible for this animated movie swoops in like Batman with a bad ass android film crew, and does their own live action film. I would also settle for Joss Whedon or Chris Nolan, in addition to those involved with RE:Damnation. Too late to make a long story short, so the primary message here is: Watch it!<br /><br />That is all.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Exciting, amazing effects,enchanting story - what more could you ask for. The only trouble is putting it down!  I want to keep on playing!
B007THA4FI|3.0|While I understand that, unlike the Harry Potter series, \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is to be an adult novel.  Unfortunately \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" just hasn't captured my attention like Harry Potter.  I will most likely finish it because I paid for it, but this makes me sad.  I wonder why I am wasting my time. J.K. Rowling is a goof zuthor, but I think her niche is Children's Liturarure.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this is a wonderful game for when you just don't want to think. has fun levels and animations. would highly recommend.
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|Seems like a good game, great graphics and sound. But every time I beat a level it crashes.....  exits to apps but saves your progress.  Then at the end of the first picture match, it crashes and doesn't save!  Would give more stars if that weren't the case.  Maybe the developer will update??????  This would be a fun game if I could get past the first level!  How do we contact the developer????  Good thing it was free!!!!!
B005COO1X6|4.0|I love Stephen King stories. The Gunslinger series got me through a tough time when I was recovering from the eighth surgery to repair my mangled leg after a car accident. His short stories always leave me wondering what the rest of the story. This story left me feeling there is more.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is one of the most simplest yet entertaining game out there. It's very hard to put down. Even the loading screen messeges are funny.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Love it! Installed it on my Kindle & almost couldn't pry it out of my son's hands to take with me while I travelled. Then, my niece & nephew discovered it. Almost didn't get to bring it home! YIKES! Another smart, problem-solving game that sucks kids in & teaches them without them realizing it!
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I WAITED A LONG TIME FOR THIS BAD CONCERT TO COME OUT AND FINALLY IT CAME OUT AND I BROUGHT IT I LOVED IT , AND I ENJOYED IT HE LOOK REAL HOT AND GORGEOUS VERY DREAMING TO LOOK AT. HE SANGS THE SONGS THAT'S MY FAVORITE,LIKE ANOTHER PART OF ME , DIRTY DIANA, AND THE BONUS OF THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL,AND OTHER SONGS. THE DANCING IS OFF THE HOOK, M.J. ROCK THAT CONCERT ,ONLY MICHAEL JACKSON CAN DO THAT, FOR REAL. IT WORTH BUYING IF YOU ARE A MICHAEL JACKSON FAN  LIKE ME.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I found the book fast paced and interesting and although the premise of this story has been done many times, Twilight Zone did a version of this in the early sixties and The Prisoner tells a similar story, Mr.Crouch did a creditable job of updating a classic yarn. The only thing I found slightly disconcerting was the main character is the most emasculated wimp imaginable.He's supposed to be a Federal Agent but spends much of the book being beaten up or drugged by women. Hopefully if the character is used in future he will grow more of a spine. Other than that The book was fine.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It it is an intriguing puzzle game that can keep you entertained for hours. I personally love it and spend my free time trying to solve these grid flows.
B000ID37RM|5.0|It isn't the book, but it hasn't sacrificed anything important. The movie stays true to the story and has shortened the time frame of the story ingeniously. Gregory Peck is amazing as Atticus Finch. Some of the other cast members could've been better, but still an excellent movie.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|I LOVE THE M.J.BAD 25TH ANNIVERSARY ,I ENJOYED THE BAD CD AND THE NEW RELEASE OF SONGS,ALSO THE 2 BOOKS WITH BEAUTIFUL PICTURE OF  M.J. AND A MICHAEL JACKSON POSTER , THE CD OF THE BAD CONCERT I LOVE IT, THE DVD OF THE BAD CONCERT AT WEMBLYS STADIUM CONCERT I ENJOYED THE CONCERT ITS WORTH BUYING THIS IS A PERFECT GIFT FOR A BIRTHDAY, CHRISTMAS OR BUY IT JUST FOR YOURSELF. LOVE IT
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|the best game you can find great story line. simple, and also it has got good pictures plus piazzas love it
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|Sure, it's fun at first. But then it gets REALLY repetitive. So yeah, it's pretty bad. I don't recommend this take at all. Just go find something else.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|First off, I wont write about the review of the movie. I will however write on what to expect when you get the 4 disc set.<br />1. Packaging:<br />It has a great slipcase with Lenticular picture of the avengers which is different from the 2 disc version. However when you open the BD case, I was suddenly shocked and \\"frantic\\" to see that there were 2 discs only on a 4 disc set. I was looking for a folder like holder for the 4 discs but it was then I realized that the discs where placed 1 on top of each other on each side of the case. Thus 2 discs in 1 holder per side thus 4 discs. Initially I thought they placed a wrong combo but I guess they made it in a way to make the case still the regular one without making it bulkier. Personally, I dont like it.<br /><br />2. Content: This has the 3D BD and BD disc with the DVD and Digital copy disc. It also comes with the code that you need to go to marvel website to activate. I have not watched the 3D so I cant comment on that. The BD version (regular) is great (Video and Audio in DTS HD). The extras are great with the deleted scenes and short movies regarding the aftermath of the war in NY. There are more extras just did not list all.<br /><br />3. Getting the freebies: As I mentioned, there is 1 code to get all of the extras. Digital copy, Avengers Music, Posters and Comics. You need to go to the marvel website(directions given) and you get it activated.<br /><br />a.Digital copy. Thanks to the heavens it is an iTunes Digital copy and NOT the horrible UV one(sorry had issues before with UV)It states it can be via Windows media player but I have not tested that. Once you load the Digital copy disc and place the code, it will get placed in your iTunes Lib.<br /><br />b. Avengers music. Now this is the best. Very Straightforward you download it and it is in mp3 format compiled in zip file around 110+Megs. The music are the soundtracks and mostly \\"rock\\" but at least no problem with the download.<br /><br />c. Posters, you are offered the 24 x 18 inch cartoon poster (free) plus shipping but you can get the 3 other posters for 19.99 dollars plus shipping.<br /><br />d. Digital comics: NOW this is frustrating. I clicked on the redeem and when I was redirected to the marvel comics website, it was asked for me to sign in or register. So I did and then it stated that it was a success. So when I logged in, lo and behold, my digital comics is not in my comics folder. It is suppose to be read via computer, iOS or android but when I tried it there (logged in) wow it is not there. I contacted marvel and after 24 hours still no word as to why that happened. It seems aftersales support is either none or very slow. My advise, REGISTER first and create a username and then log in and then redeem the code. The register while redeeming does not seem to go smoothly.<br /><br />Price I got: 19.99 dollars during the special price from Amazon.<br />Overall: The movie and the extras are great! The packaging should be Good except the 2 disc in 1 holder thing. The freebies are nice especially the NOT UV digital copy. Thank you iTunes. But thumbs down to the digital comics glitchy redemption thing. Marvel comics are you still having no response to my technical issue? So total score 4/5.<br />Hope this helps your purchase decision
0547581033|5.0|reads out loud so well, our children love it and have asked for it over and over. Probably ranks in our top 20 all time favorite toddler books. Gave this as a gift at a baby shower as well because I wanted to pass on this little gem of a book!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it, it keeps me company. You should all try it! Try not being forever alone for once with your new friend, Pinterest!
B008XG1X18|4.0|amazing. I'm obsessed with this website and the app is even better and makes it way easier to pin my fav things
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Please be warned! This movie is NOT FOR CHILDREN! The PG-13 rating is no lie, here. There are images and themes in this movie that could easily give any sensitive adult nightmares. Here are some EXAMPLES of only a few of the scenes children would find deeply disturbing (as did I):  The evil queen tells her newly married husband, the king, of her hatred of men, who \\"use women,\\" just before she kills him on their honeymoon bed.  A few scenes later you watch as her brother kisses her shoulder as he and the queen hint at an incestuous relationship with each other. In order to preserve her beauty, the queen eats the hearts of an animal or bird of some sort, which you see cut open at her dinner table, as she digs the heart out and puts it in her mouth.  The queen pulls the heart out of one of her subjects after he attempts to assassinate her.  No child should ever be exposed to such horrors.  You can definitely cross this movie off your Christmas list!
0811879542|5.0|If you are tired of your average toddler book, than this is your new favorite book. Great for teaching to follow directions, colors, listening skills, cause and effect, directional (right/left), sizes, etc.  And the best part is your child will be having so much fun they won't even know they are learning! We checked out this book at the library and after reading it the first time, I promptly went to Amazon to buy it.  This is a keeper! Can't wait to give this book as a gift because I know it will be a hit. One tip, this book is read best snuggled in a chair or in bed with your toddler. We first tried to read at the dinner table but this book is interactive and needs one on one attention, which in our case makes a great bed time book when we are one and one and completely focused on the book.  Buy this book, you won't be disappointed with this little gem!!
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|Causual play is very relaxing.  Makes one think about how to improve the score.<br />Much like bejeweled with several twists and spins.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|it is a very enjoyable game. it is good to pass the time. nothing is bad about that I see.
0525953728|5.0|Names have been changed as appropriate, classified information redacted, but this account of the storming of an important terrorist cell in Pakistan is riveting, authentic, convincing. One wishes only that it had been more thoroughly proofread and edited for grammar, syntax, diction, orthography. One misspelled word, for example, is \\"verbage\\" for \\"verbiage.\\" A common grammatical error is \\"like\\" for \\"as.\\" There are disagreements between subjects and verbs. Is it too much to ask that military authors observe the conventions of correct writing?
051756338X|5.0|Very well written.  Starts in pre-historic times and gives a lot of good information for a novel.  (Much like James Michener  I highly recommend.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It is a Very, very, very, very,very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, Addictive game
B008KP2VZY|4.0|I use Goodreader and sugar sync on iOS.<br />On Nexus 7 with ezPdf Reader this is so money.<br />Good features all around. I although it hangs up once in a while.
B007SGM084|5.0|Knew I should not have read these books. Forced walk down memory lane and the one who got away. I had a \\"Christian Grey.\\" But that was then. I ended it and tell myself everyday that leaving was the right choice. Forgot how life-affirming passionate love can be. Thanks to this trilogy I got to relive through the eyes of another the amazing ride that was my \\"Christian Grey.\\"
B008966SIU|1.0|I saw Grizzly Bear at the Greek Theater in LA the other night.  If you've never been - it's one of the more beautiful venues in the world, outdoors in a tree-lined canyon, perfect acoustics, and chock full of the stylish, hip, beautiful people LA is famous for.  I will admit, I am not a big Grizzly Bear fan.  I went because my girlfriend wanted to go.  The band went on to much fanfare.  People seem to like them.  I was willing to listen.<br /><br />About forty five minutes into their show, here's what I found myself wondering:<br /><br />Imagine, if you can, that some time in humanity's distant past - say, hundreds of years ago - a terrible disease appeared and afflicted mankind.  It was wiping us out.  All of us.  Everyone on the planet.  But at the last minute, a resolute team of scientists and doctors found the root cause, and saved us all.  The cause, it turned out to be, was testosterone.  For some strange reason, this hormone that helps differentiate the sexes was killing us all.  Scientists and doctors figured out a way to remove testosterone from our bodies, and our lives, permanently.  How did we continue to procreate?  I don't know.  Maybe it involves taking a few sperm samples from all males right before castrating them.  Doesn't matter.  What matters is, our species has now spent hundreds of years without any testosterone in our bodies.  We continue as a society, but testosterone free.  We have lived so long as a species without testosterone that no one really even remembers what it was like when our species had testosterone, when men had balls.  It is no longer simply a physiological shortcoming.  It has become so ingrained in our culture, this ball-less-ness, that it has changed how we think, how we feel, how we act as a species.  It has also changed our cultural output.  Our art, our writing, our music - all of it is a product of a testosterone-free species.<br /><br />It is these conditions - generations upon generations of testosterone-free humanity- that allowed Grizzly Bear to be born.<br /><br />That's what I found myself thinking.  \\"How many generations of ball-less-ness must it have taken to allow a band like Grizzly Bear to exist?\\"  Man oh man.  This band is SO pretentious.  And don't ever worry about being over-burdened with anything resembling a hook or a riff.  This is not what Grizzly Bear do.  They entertain and impress one another with multi-layered \\"stylings\\" and a-capella musings and pretty-boy wanderings that will leave you craving a SONG.  Of any kind.  Please.<br /><br />I tried, at about the hour mark, to get my girlfriend to leave.  She was quite surprised when I suggested \\"hey how about we get out of here?\\"  \\"But.... why?\\"  \\"Well,\\" says I, \\"I was thinking maybe we get back to my place a little sooner?  You know, so we can make with the sexy time?\\"  Not surprisingly, an hour of listening to Grizzly Bear left her entirely uninterested in sex.  Because, as I said, Grizzly Bear is the most ball-less music ever invented.<br /><br />Worst show I've seen in at least 10 years.  There.  I said it, and I'm not taking it back.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have so many ideas now. It is a great resource. I love everything you can find. I have learned a lot.
B004UID2LC|5.0|The best flipping app ever! everyone should get this if they don't want to buy songs! Love it and of course still have it!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|really great game. was extremely hard to put down. the only thing is I wish it was a little bit longer. otherwise one of the best mystery games I've played so far. I give 2 thumbs up!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It's like bejeweled with a lot of different maps and a story line. The music is great, too!  I love this game!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great contuaion of the Hunger Games!  Be warned, you won't want to wait to read the third book, The Mockingjay.
B000YDAYHC|3.0|Great looking boot but the sizes run really big.  I normally wear a size 12 and the boot was a full size to big so I had to go with an 11.  Other than that it is a decent boot.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a very addictive game.  You keep hooked trying to get prizes and special items that drop on the screen.  I wish coins dropped faster.
B00095NX9G|5.0|This dvd is tough if one is untrained in yoga or general exercise, but has great stretches and postures. at the beginning of each new step, the postures are restated, and the steps are fairly clear. the movement through the steps, to an untrained person, is a quick progression though, and i ended up rewinding to practice the more complicated steps again. if one wanted to get into shape, this will definitely help to strengthen the core, back, shoulders, and legs more thoroughly. the first time i used the dvd (i have very little experience with yoga and dance), i didn't even make it halfway through the first disc before i took a break and went back to it later. for an untrained, unexercised, unstrengthened person, this dvd will require persistence and training, but is an excellent choice to work with and build up to.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a fun game to play with your family. Fun Fun Fun Fun Fun Fun Fun Fun Fun Fun. Fun!!!
B0021L8V0W|4.0|I have read a lot of negative reviews which, I think, speak more of male insecurity than the movie itself. Angelina Jolie is the movie, and, if you like Jolie, you will like this movie. She brings subtle depth to what could have been a very shallow character. Her martial arts is smooth and believable - the outcome, like all actions movies requires suspension of disbelief. It doesn't matter if it is Matt Damon or Angelina Jolie dropping opponents left and right, or, Chow Yun Fat flying through the air - the viewer always has to buy in. Why is it that men can accept Ulma Thurman and Michelle Yeon performing both gravity and strength defying stunts, but have so much difficulty accepting Jolie outside her role as Lara Croft. I found that the movie held my attention through out. However, the movie does have holes, and, I think the ending in the Extended Version is far better than the Cinema Release or the Director's Cut.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Love it! Worth every penny!!!! It alerted me when my battery was low, so I plugged my Fire up &amp; BAM!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book takes off where book one ended.  I couldn't imagine reading separetly. I enjoy the consistency of characters etc.  I am already on book 3 and loving it!!
B0018OFNHC|4.0|Carlito's Way is a solid crime movie, with its share of action and drama. Sean Penn is in strong form as the supporting character of the sleazy lawyer that helps Pacino's character Carlito throughout the movie. I wont talk much about the plot, except that it comes full circle, much like scarface, yet is not as satisfying of a crime movie. However, in its own right, it is a great Pacino film and a must have among crime films like Casino and Goodfellas.

B000V39KDO|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br />Gerald Butler is in strong form in this action-film adaptation of the battle of 300 Spartan Warriors. The visual and audio quality of this movie is phenomenal, the fights are breathtaking, and the story has you hoping against hope that these mighty Spartan Warriors can, in fact, survive the onslaught of tens of thousands of adversaries. This is truly an epic film.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Such a great story! Only wish I would have read it sooner. It was very inspirational and I would recommend it to anyone. I can't wait to see the movie! :)
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I guess I am not one of the \\"smart\\" people. Who wrote this mess of a movie? It was like watching Scooby Doo meets the Jetsons. What was the plot? What was the POINT? I thought this was an Alien the movie prequel? Others have pointed out all of the very obvious incredibly stupid scenes in this, ahem, \\"movie\\"... I spent most of the movie going \\"huh\\", trying to figure out why I was sitting there wasting my time watching this when I could be changing the oil in my pick up... And I hate changing the oil in my truck...
1609611543|5.0|While I do like the book overall, I do wish it had more recipes.  However I do HIGHLY recommend this book.  I also recommend everyone stay away from ALL corn because at least 98% of all corn grown in the US is GMO and GMO is just as bad if not WORSE than wheat and gluten.<br /><br />Very scary studies have just come out in like the last 2 months about cancer and tumors caused by long term use of GMOS.  If you are going to go through the time and expense in avoiding wheat it makes no sense to still eat GMOS.
032147404X|3.0|I just recently entered to the DSLR world: I bought a Nikon D5100. Due to highly reviews I bought this book. After I read it, I could have some interesting pictures, but really with no difference with the ones taken with my canon elph point and shot.  Next, I bought Bryan Peterson's Understanding Photography - Field Guide-: amazing, excellent book, with this book I really understood photography and began to take beautiful pictures, especially in the field: outside, traveling, city, landscapes, people, etc. And lastly, I bought Rob Sylvan: Nikon D5100: From Snapshotas to Great Shots, wow, first time my portraits were totally sharp (at 100% magnifying); it help me out to gain and improve skills. Unfortunately, The Digital Photography Book did not fulfill my expectations: easy to read, but very simple; one tip for this, but no good explanation or alternatives.

B000002KET|4.0|I've been reacquiring and revisiting all of the \\"Ozzy Era\\" Sabbath albums, but this time I'm able to take the time and listen to them in chronological order, as opposed to cobbling together dubbed cassettes from friends' collections when I was a teenager.<br /><br />I remember 15 year old me thinking this was the album where they started to \\"wuss out\\" a little. 43-year old me now recognizes that Sabbath were simply growing beyond, sacrificing a little brute force for some more sophisticated touches. It's also obvious they spent a little more time recording and mixing, because this is the first Sabbath record with the Ozzy vocal sound you hear on his solo albums, more out front and loud and clear.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|I cannot rate this higher until something is done about the update situation! After the absolute fiasco that was the AB Space update Amazon is now adding ridiculous delays to all updates.<br />Amazon blames Rovio, Rovio blames Amazon. I don't care! Somebody pick up the phone and talk to each other.<br />This is nuts!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Love how the game is so interactive. Keeps you engrossed for hours. Can't wait for the new one to be released.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|A great adventure.  If you liked Forest Gump you will love this.<br />A great tale well spun.  Couldn't put it down.
B00022M518|3.0|Perhaps on the CD version it is harder to discern the connection between the artwork and title, but remembering the vinyl version I get it. Let's leave it at that. With this in mind I can't help drawing parallels between this album and Andy Warhol's Velvet underground with Nico. If you like that lo-fi pop played with a certain confidence, this might be for you. For my part, I bought this for the infectious riff of the title track then found the rest didn't quite hold my interest. It's not because it's bad, rather it just doesn't sync with my taste.

B008XBCJ34|2.0|Poorly scripted, woefully derivative, with its strict adherence to tried and true aesthetic, predictable plot paradigms and run-of-the-mill character archetypes (from the fascist, sadistic battle hardened, pseudo-macho rhetoric spouting military commander and his scorched earth philosophy, to the protagonist's foil, usually a high ranking type that eschews miscegenation, that vies for the affection of the love interest and employs subterfuge when convenient), it's difficult to glean any merit aside from the obvious eye-candy factor. The film borrows heavily from a veritable host of sources (The Bible, The Gospels, the conversion of Saul, The Story of Pocahontas) and incorporates ideas already seen in such films as Dances with Wolves, Shogun (the mini-series), The Last Samurai, Equilibrium, Star Wars, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Matrix, etc. Avatar as a movie suffers from infusion of a variety of been there/done that plot/sub-plot structures: an emphatically embraced, albeit misinterpreted prophesy (why are there always a prophesy in these films?) provided by a(n always old) Shaman, a Christ-like protagonist (there's even a resurrection of sorts), successful infiltration of an indigenous populace born of duplicity on the part of the protagonist, empathy born out of desire (why are the love interests in these films always princesses or persons of noble birth?) on the part of the protagonist, an eventual appreciation for (always primitive) culture, an event or a series of events that clearly identifies the antagonist as the prophesied (taming of the Banshee/Leonopteryx?), an epiphany born out of internal struggles and morality complexes, a conversion and/or switching of loyalties, a profound revelation that either uncovers the protagonist's or belies his new-found intent, an attempt at reconciliation, technology/industry vs nature, faith in an unseen benevolent entity as the catalyst for victory, replete with religious overtone, and the list goes...Would this film be even half as critically lauded if it were made ten years ago, without all of the wiz-bang gimmickry?lm be even half as critically lauded if it were made ten years ago, without all of the wiz-bang gimmickry?

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I couldn't put it down!  William Landay is now one of my favorite authors.  Definitely up there with Dennis Lehane and James Patterson.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I loved this book.  It was so fun to read and relive the old fairy tales as an adult.  I think this is a great book for kids for a different twist on the old favorites.  I think adults alike would enjoy the adventure and how creative the author told the other side of the stories we never knew.

B001EYU1VO|4.0|Hi, I read all there is to read about this stick on the Internet and watched all there is to watch on YouTube before I made my decision to buy it (took me a couple of weeks). In a sense - everybody are right about this product. I have it for a month now, so far so good.<br /><br />If you are short tempered and/or tend to compensate your lack of gaming skill by pushing things harder then this stick is definitely not for you.<br />Yes, I can definitely see that buttons (and everything else) can be easily bent and broken and you do not need super strength for that - just a tiny bit of frustration.<br />Yes, I am yet to use all that adjustments you can make with included tool (save for height adjustment which requires none), because the _very_ little force I apply so far seems to be not sufficient.<br />Yes, the stick will tip over to the front if you do not rest your hand weight on it just right.<br />Yes, you do need to apply quite a bit of force to overcome stiff spring - one finger definitely not enough.<br />Yes, you need to be software guru to even install the software under W7/64 - like launching proper exe from obscure temporary folder which is created somewhere on your disk _when_ normal setup fails...<br />Yes, default control templates you can download for FSX are absolutely not worth bothering and you do need to read manual from cover to cover and in between the lines to make better ones.<br />Yes I am quite handy with solder iron for any loose internal wires and can order/replace electronic components like faulty resistors if/when they will fail.<br />Yes, I _can_ wait 5 years till I upgrade my PC two times over if current one is too weak to play any new games.<br /><br />So once you are ok with the above then the stick is an absolute marvel to behold. Centering and dead zones are (almost) perfect. The software (I did managed to run it) let's to customize the actions beyond any common sense - like you can have multiple shift buttons and assign gazilion keyboard commands even to different axis positions - my favorite being to shift-map FSX \\"trim\\" functions directly on Y-axis while retaining its primary function in FSX.<br /><br />Rudder controls on the stick itself is a \\"budget\\" idea. Too much freedom degrees to control with just one hand so \\"coordinated turns\\" are yet to be mastered by me. It is extremely handy for any and all chopper missions and for steering while on the ground though.<br /><br />So in short - do not \\"buy and forget\\" it for your kids. This stick needs lots of commitment and patience, but it will reward you if you them. Actually if you had patience to read the whole post you may qualify...

0439023513|2.0|First -- no problem with story arc in terms of who dies, who Katniss chooses or even the too brief epilogue.  Author gets to make these decisions.  Other reviews written here have helped me understand those decisons better and see the trilogy differently.  Thank you.<br /><br />Seeing as the movie will soon be on the hold shelf at the library for me, and that everyone has read these books, I have just read all three back-to-back this month.  Obviously needed to read the third book after the fiorst two to see what happens.  This third and final installment of the Hunger Games Trilogy is, as most people have said to me, dissatifying and NOT as good as the first two.  Why?  Katniss further evolves into a whiny, dislikeable and obtuse character.  Reading other reviews this is apparently intentional, realistic and necessary in expalining the mental deterioration brought on by war.  War and its fallount are a hopeless morass.  I side with those readers who desire hope and uplift from reading.  The central characters of a book should carry that theme IMO.<br /><br />Major plot elements are left unresolved including an ending which introduces unresolved new elements.  Major (and minor) character arcs are unresolved, unexplained.  After two great books this one was rushed, verbose without offering clarity.  So SPOILER ALERT in terms of what you won't find in this book (in no particular order):<br /><br />Any explanation of the technology or evolution of \\"mutts.\\"  The reader never learns about what those creatures exactly were in 74th Games.  The actual formerly dead tributes reanimated?  Humanoid spawn?  Robots using human parts?  The author explains reasonably tracker jackets and mockingjays -- genetic enginnering.  In the final book are more mutts -- even more confusing and unexplained along with...<br /><br />Poor writing...  one pod after another...  just literally label something, perhaps offer an effect or two and give no explantion...  technology with no literary limits...  seriously Collins may has well of had people turned to stone, light sabers, spells, werewolves, time travel...<br /><br />We never learn what is outside of Panem.  Places (woods, lake, cabins, geography) exist outside each district's boundaries.  These places are connected by railway at least -- but represent no district in themselves nor indication of habitation, maintenance, affiliation or history.  The book alludes to the destruction of Panem and obliteration of its inhabitants as the end of humnaity, but never explains this boundary.  Clearly The Capitol requires the resources, human and natural, of the Twelve Districts -- most importantly district 2.  Yet District 13 builds and subsists from what?  They cannot adequately feed themselves, but can build this vast bunker and host of nifty weapons?<br /><br />So lacking explanation or history or geography, in any form of expository writing, we have no basis to understand the original war, the motives of Snow or Coin, exactly what anyone is fighting for aside from not having to sacrifice their kids annually, any sense of what freedom is being sought (District 13 is already free and apparently being left alone, and granting asylum to anyone making it there)...  Once District 13 is revealed in the third book there was so much room literarily, in 400 pages, to explain things...  LIKE MOTIVE!<br /><br />The Mockingjay pin is given Katniss in the first book BEFORE she wins the 74th Games or before the berries.  How was she chosen?  What is the history of the pin?  Where is the plot hatched?  How was it known she could do this?  What if she hadn't won those games?  If it was rigged for her to do so, as the 75th Games were monitored and rigged, where is that explained?<br /><br />Being in Katniss's head so much, we get no sense of what Snow really wants or needs, why Boggs does what he does, of why Peeta should be killed or why no one else can be trusted, what Haymitch really thinks, what Coin wanted and why, what would have come from Coin being the leader or why that makes a difference, why was Plutach helping Coin<br /><br />Yeah, I am rambling.  This is how I felt about this third book.  A complete mess with a depressing, unfulfilling ending that made me regret reading the first two books.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|if u are in a very very very long car ride this app is perfect for u it is very addicting!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Not a literature master piece, but indeed a good novel. I got totally hooked reading none stop the trilogy.<br />Is of course very fictional but once you get over that you'll enjoy it. If you liked books like twilight this is for you
0316228532|5.0|This book was not as novelly as I had expected because it was impossible for me to really care about any of the characters.  The story had too many weak entanglements and I thought it ended quite abruptly.  There wasn't one main character, really, but a variety of background characters of greater or lesser importance.<br /><br />Line for line, however, it was brilliant.  This book proves that Rowling has really observed people and she's astoundingly poetic while pounding an imbecile onto the page.  The story was engaging, but it was the detailed writing that really drew me in and kept me entertained.  I feel the same way about David Foster Wallace's work.  It's not the kind of book I would read to be swept away; it's what I would read to restore my faith in eloquent writers and to know that I'm not alone in my astonishment that such vacuous, selfish, spiteful, violent slogs reside in such close proximity to nice people, in a nice setting, often even behind a \\"nice person\\" facade.  I know these people.  I've lived in a small town and have interacted with all of these characters; I've even been a few of them.<br /><br />I did not pee my pants and wince at the \\"f\\" word (or the \\"c\\", \\"t\\", \\"p\\", \\"b\\" or \\"a\\" words slathered richly throughout), as so many people have pretended to.  This book felt like it was firmly planted in reality (albeit fiction) and there were no horrifying, G-rated substitutes pasted over anything to increase marketability.  I only laughed once while reading this book, but it was a belly laugh lasting a few minutes, and I dropped the book.  The sad parts are sudden and arresting, but you're quickly whisked back up to regular life (so feel free to read this on the plane).

B009NQKPUW|4.0|This movie was good but it could have been better. A lot of unanswered questions of course which would lead into another sequel.<br /><br />Was this a prequel to the Alien franchise? Technically, I would say yes because it did show the Alien mural that Charlie saw in the back of the cave behind the huge stone face and the birth of the xeno at the end of the movie. But what I'm confused at is I that for the xeno to be full grown like it was when it came out of the Engineers body that it had to be the snake like creature that we had come custom to seeing in the Alien movies and then growing by shedding it's skin to full grown Alien. So I was bit thrown when I saw that.<br /><br />I believe there is lot more in that cave then we realize. Charlie stated that it was another burial site. But for what? When he was behind the head there was a big green stone sticking up like maybe it was a way to unlock a door or something what every was behind that Alien mural. I believe that planet is significant and needs to be further looked into.<br /><br />And hears something else to think about. Must we not forget about the Predators who hunted the Xeno's. I know that is a whole different story. But they tie into this somewhere along the way.<br /><br />Looking forward to the getting some answers to this?
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Charlize..made this movie...had it not been for her wickedness this movie might have fell short, but this lady knows how to act..so she really pulled it together, and made you feel like she was really a nasty queen...so it is a must seen, its a dark take on Snow White!
B0091XRL86|5.0|We rented this movie for a family movie night.  My daughters had been wanting to see it, and I was pretty impressed.  It was completely appropriate for my 10, 7, 7, and 5yo while keeping my wife and I entertained also.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Minecraft is basically Legos: The Video Game. How does that translate to Minecraft: The Lego Version? Suprisingly well.<br /><br />The pieces are kind of small, so it's weird building things at first, but you adjust the size to the scale pretty quickly.<br /><br />It's excellent for kids or fans of the game, honestly you could rebuild some pretty awesome as an homage to things you built in-game<br /><br />The downside is that there's no limit to what you can build in minecraft, but with legos, you're limited by number of legos. I'd stick with minecraft to building things and enjoying the whole creativity aspect, but it's great (and a blast of nostalgia) trying these as a complement, not a substitute.
B004GNFSO0|5.0|My dad bought me this book when he bought me my Kindle. He loves adventure & travel books and said it was one of the best and most memorable he has ever read (and he reads a lot). I haven't read this type of book since the mid-90's with Alive, Into The Wild, A Perfect Storm & Into Thin Air. But this book was far more touching. The way the characters are created and played out really get your heart involved, and there are some tearjerker moments for sure. You will also laugh and root for these people along the way, which was unexpected for me since I approached this book as more of a historical biography and didn't expect it to read like a great novel. Also, my husband is Russian and his grandfather spent 30 years in a Siberian prison for his religious beliefs, so this book really had a personal element to it for me. According to my husband the prison details as well as how the police and \\"court\\" system handled things were very accurate. This only added to the drama and brutality of what the characters endured. I think this book is an amazing testament to the power of people's convictions and inner strength, and is a great read. [Who cares what all the haters say about it being fabricated, it is an engaging story and worth reading nonetheless.]
B005SZAEYO|5.0|This is a refreshing new take on scary, freaky....and AMAZING writing!!! I absolutely love this show!<br />The characters are unique and strange, but fit together...it's like Stephen King meets Dean Kootnz...<br />I'm just hooked...and cannot wait until season 2 starts tomorrow night!
B008KS4DR0|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, the funny rednecks who aren't out to hurt anyone and the stupid \\"college kids\\" who keep getting killing.  It obviously was filmed out West and not in WV, but so what it doesn't matter at all in this movie.  It's just a stupid good time of a movie, it doesn't take itself seriously and neither should you.  But was entertaining.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|NO SPOILERS REVIEW<br /><br />Season 2 had a lot of character development, slow-paced scenes, which was disappointing considering the first season set the series up as a more fact-paced, action-packed show. I love the post-apocalyptic setting, so I got through the second season anyways.<br /><br />This episode was amazing, I love the last few minutes, it got me excited for the show again. WATCH IT.

B005LAIHGI|2.0|Eh.<br />Some cute vignettes, but that's it.<br />Does not hold together well.<br />Characterizations not even believable in comedy...better was \\"You Don't Mess With the Zohan\\".<br />Although the problems with Adam Sandler's hair were in another latitude...

B009CPJHY4|3.0|A eye opening wake up call for those entering into retirement years. Also a reminder that no matter what our personal circumstances may be we can always find a way out and a way to enjoy our life. Brought together by a variety of circumstances each character deals with the circumstances in their own way. It was entertaining, sad, joyful and beautiful.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|At first, I had no idea how the game works...I even had to google it and it pretty much said, \\"The game is so easy there are no directions for it.\\" Hmmm. Well, when I started reading other people's comments, then I realized that my opponent draws, I guess using the letters provided, then I draw. Ahhh...got it. What threw me off in the first place was that the very first person I was \\"randomly\\" selected to play with wrote the answer on the screen. HUH?? I didn't get it. Then some other people commented on how others cheated by just giving the answer away. What fun is that?? Now, if I get randomly selected to play with someone who does that I write to them that they are lame and delete them. I love the actual process of watching my opponents drawings come to life before me. Man, I have been put against some AMAZING artists. They really are so good, while mine are rudimentary at best and most of the time I'm apologizing and congratulating them on guessing correctly at my horrific picture! I love this game. I can't wait to get home to play it everyday. (It's really a good thing I can't play it at work... I'd be homeless by now, but incredibly happy sitting with my Kindle Fire under an overpass in my cardboard box!)
B009329ZF2|5.0|I was curious to see this movie for myself after critics killed it this past summer.  My expectations were low and happily they were surpassed.  This was one fun,mindless, action adventure movie.  The story and plot were fun and the movie was thoroughly enjoyable!!

B008CLI3TE|5.0|I'm not going to be able to say anything here that hasn't already been said about this amazing show. As I have not read the books yet I can really judge this show based on how it plays as a standalone piece as opposed to comparing it to the source. I think the acting is brilliant, the directing, the sets, sceneries (most of all of this show is shot on location) special effects and casting as well as pacing is stellar. I have absolutely no complaints about this show. It's the best show on tv right now (aside from Breaking Bad) and easily the best piece of fantasy ever shot for television. On Blu-Ray this show is immaculate, black levels are deep, colors are vibrant and lush, texture detail is sharp, and with certain scenes being shot on 35mm, actually have retained film grain. This show has everything that a fantasy fan could want, zombies, dragons, beheadings and tons of great female nudity. Since this show plays on HBO the standard running time per episode is about an hour since there are no commercial breaks. Special features are plentiful and the audio commentary is entertaining and informative as it should be. Any fan of Lord Of The Rings or Frank Frazetta art or Conan The Barbarian will like this show for the same reasons they like those fantasy pieces. This show doesn't cater to stupid people, if you aren't paying attention then you won't be able to keep track of people or place names. This show has magic and mysticism like you would want a fantasy show to have while grounding it in a very authentic Medieval setting with political intrigue. I highly recommend this show.
1936608898|5.0|Read this book with my college daughter....to help her eat more healthy.  We loved the book and both decided to take the challlenge and start their program.  Happily we lost weight, have more energy, just feel better!!  Great meal ideas too!!
B003JHKORK|5.0|I've read the books, I'd say the books were better. But the movie is absolutely amazing. Can't wait for the next movie to come out soon!
0399157565|5.0|This is my favorite time of year. I look forward each year until Ms. Cornwell share her genius with us and gives us another Scarpetta novel. THE BONE BED has so many surprises. I absolutely loved it. It has less computer technical jargon, but has just the right amount of autopsy details to make the tummy twitch. Marino, Lucy and Benton are back, plus a surprise character from the past. Benton is still a knucklehead, and I have tried for years to change my opinion of him but THE BONE BED didn't succeed in changing my mind, maybe Scarpetta 21 will succeed. I hate to write to much because I wouldn't want to spoil Ms. Cornwell's gem for anyone. I will say that I enjoyed every page and can't wait for her next Scarpetta novel.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|I bought the UK Fan Pack, which included the CD, a nice booklet on RUSH and key chain thanks to a friend stationed in the UK.<br />I listened to the album several times end to end and it was like a journey, which made even more sense once I got the book of the same name.  The book is a good story of predetermined future and the search for an alternate version of what you were told your life was to be.  The album came alive after reading the book.  Several of the songs were good before and were made better with the inclusion of reading the novel.  The whole concept album became visual like the novel as I listened more and more to the CD.....which I listen to each day at work.<br />I liked the album before the novel and now love it!!!
1400095204|5.0|I think we've all grown up seeing images of starving children in Africa. But until a few months ago I knew none of the details of Nigeria's Biafran War and the starvation that went along with it. Half a Yellow Sun, however, is not a history of the atrocities of this particular war. It is an intricately woven novel about five people -- twin sisters, their lovers (one an Igbo-speaking Englishman, the other a fiery hearted professor with revolutionary ideals for his country), and a young Igbo houseboy. It's a story that uncovers the thoughts and spirits of these people as their lives intersect with each others' and as the events of the Biafran War unfold. We see both hidden depths of strength and unanticipated weakness in the loves of the characters we come to love.<br /><br />The author of this book is herself Nigerian, and though she's too young to have herself experienced the events of which she writes, her understanding of the heartblood of her country pulses through in her writing. This is not an outsider looking in. This book allows us a chance to better understand Nigeria, not as \\"some place in Africa where there was a war,\\" but as a real place with real people -- living, loving, suffering.<br /><br />Half a Yellow Sun is not an easy book. Its subject matter rips deeply into us and makes us question our beliefs about humanity. But it's a beautifully crafted window into the lives of people living in and trying to make sense of a time and place full of evil.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is a variant of the myriad of connect three games. It gives, however, a refreshingly unique face to the game.  The developer has successfully blended puzzles and hidden object type gameplay into a very enjoyable experience.
B003PPDBQ2|5.0|Couldn't put this book down. The conclusion was unexpected and kept me reading right up until the end. Can't wait to read her other books.
B007TK77QE|1.0|very difficult to read,didn't have any sort of flow,too many characters waffling on about nothing.<br />I am an avid reader but was disappointed with this book.It was a waste of money.
B008K9UZY4|4.0|This is a mega CD Classic, it is a great game. But where's the SOUND TEST? My favorite part is the sound test. Can someone please tell me how to get it if there is one?<br /><br />Also, I don't reccomend typing this in for ST;<br />Fm:46 Da:12 Pcm:25
1416972242|5.0|To really enjoy this book you have to read the whole series of Mortal Instruments beginning with book one or you will not really know what is going on. It is a very different theme from the usual fantasy, featuring vampires, werewolves, and other supernatural characters in a modern city setting, unseen by mere mortals, but nothing like you would expect. Vampires are \\"the in thing\\" right now and there are plenty of them in these books,  [[ASIN:1416972242 City of Ashes (Mortal Instruments)] These are not the usual vampire stories.<br /><br />I loved the entire series so far. I have read the first four and enjoyed every line. Teens and older adults will love this series (I am 70). I usually prefer mysteries but this series got me hooked. I can't wait to get book 5.
B00622B3MY|4.0|This a good show for kids, I dont think it was as good as the first, but who am I right, Im not a 5-10 year old, my son seems to like it and that is what matters.
030758836X|3.0|I enjoyed the book for about 3/5ths the way through but after a point, the characters felt stagnant and the ending was such a flop! I felt like the whole book had a good pace and then in the last chapter it just went into hyperspeed for the sake of ending the book. Pretty disappointing.
B000025RHI|3.0|I'm more than a little mystified at all the glowing reviews and \\"best album ever\\" hype about this CD. It's not bad, I enjoy listening to it, and yet it doesn't really grab me or send me into convulsions of bliss or ecstasy. Songs? Uh, these guys jam and groove more than write memorable songs. I keep listening and I just don't get the \\"wow\\" factor. I love Trojan label reggae, Marley, Steel Pulse, Black Uhuru, and even Lee Perry. Maybe I need to smoke a few spliffs to \\"get it\\", but for now this is nothing more than \\"okay\\" in my book.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I am completely enjoying the entire series of these books.  I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|This movie is unbelievably terrible.<br /><br />This movie had a great premise and initial idea, a great opportunity to be a prequel to the Alien Franchise, and an enormous budget.  However, I believe they had 5 year old children actually write the screen play.  It was atrocious... the plot holes and failure to identify that the audience may be somewhat educated, made me feel like I was listening to a Current Day Republican rattle off their beliefs.<br /><br />This movie is not even worth illegal download.  DO NOT purchase this.  Please if you have the yearning to purchase a movie... buy Battleship or Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter... both of those were excellent and deserving of a purchase for your movie library.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|There are a lot of good books written about the recent war on terror but a few stand out and this book clearly does.  Since it was written by a professional writter it rivals those of Mark Bowden and Bing West.  This book is clear, concise and intense.<br /><br />Adam Brown fought his demons and became the best of the best: as a person and a professional.  He is my hero.
B005LAIHPE|3.0|I gave this flim a 3 1/2star  for all the action from start to end. It has a story line that flows

0440422973|5.0|OMG THIS BOOK WAS SOOOO FUNNY!! I could NOT put it down! My 83 year old aunt gave it to me after telling me it was a hoot and boy was she right! This was soo different from any of Grisham's previous works and it was such an easy fun light read! They need to hurry up and make a movie out of it!!<br />Couldn't stop LAUGHING
B004IDYK0G|5.0|I heard these guys on the radio with 'Breakeven' and 'The Man Who Can't Be Moved' and it led me to search for more of their music. I can't believe what I found...<br />These guys are awesome and in my humble opinion...this is the best pop album to come out in a very long time.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it is what it is. can get really boring at times but it does what it says and if you like this game at the fair its kinda fun to do it at home. a good game for when you are super bored.
1936608898|4.0|This book is little hard to follow but it gives a general idea. I like Mark Sisson's BluePrint Primal better. It only the reader's preferance. The book gave lots of valuable comparison which I enjoyed it a lot.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this game. the coins move more realistically than other similar games. it passes the time when you want mind bubblegum.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|This movie was very exciting and well done. The special effects were terrific. It is, however, a very dark movie and extremely violent. Definitely  not for the younger set.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Go to regular books and you will see a Kindle option. For anyone who loves John Corey's sense of humor this is wonderful.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|Movie was great wasn't sure what to think of a remake but have watched it several times and keep laughing!
B001AH6ZWY|1.0|I liked the movie but got ripped off because the dvd stopped in the middle of the movie and I couldn't watch the whole movie.  It sucks because I can't find a way to discuss this problem with anyone.  I would not recommend using this company for dvd streaming.
B0053F03MM|4.0|a good story with a succesfull transition to screen, not usually a big Jake G. fan, but he did not do any damage to the tale.
B003ZFCBJ0|5.0|It's a great movie that deals with the impact to kids of divorce and death.  Miley Cyrus was fabulous in this movie....guessing she was able to play 'herself'.  The scenery was perfect, and the supporting actors/actresses were great as well.  I could watch this movie over and over again.  The only thing that would have made it better is if Miley got to sing in the movie.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I was addicted immediately! very intuitive and pretty to look at.I would recommend it. glad that I downloaded it. And for free!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Please arrange a free time for 5-6 hours because you can not drop the book until you see the end remarks.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|fifty shades darker was a great book.  It was not only about the relationship but had exciting  parts to it and kept you wanting to read more.

B0085Y4JF0|5.0|I got way more than expected for the price with these item. Looks to be made from quality materials, good buckles and a ton of extras. The pistol mag pouches are adjustable to fit different size mags and it fits well. Haven't tested it yet in the dirt but plan to soon. I would recommend this to a friend.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It seems like your basic jewel matching game, but it has an extra twist that adds an interesting challenge. Combined with a somewhat compelling storyline, this becomes more than your average jewel matcher.
1439152802|5.0|Read my full review @ [...]    My opinion: I love me some Kate Morton and have read each and every one of her books. Hands down, I consider her to be one of the most original authors I have read. She has continued this tradition of high quality writing in The Secret Keeper. Morton has a history of incredibly strong yet approachable character development. Yet, she has the capabilities to write with engrossing storylines full of twists that leave the readers with a \\"WTH just happened?\\" moments.    I was sucked into this book immediately and ended up reading a 450+ page book in several hours. I absolutely couldn't put it down and consider this to be Morton's best book to date.    On a side note, I received this book from Atria Books as an ebook for review. In the future, I will wait for Morton's books to come out in print as I consider them to be special treats. I didn't like the formatting of the ebook and feel that it did distract somewhat from the story. So, make the investment and grab the book in print. It is well worth the extra couple of bucks!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|So many historical happenings in so many different countries are brought together in an easily understood format.  Casual conversation of events of the day open the path to how those events affect the individual.  Following the characters on their everyday life journey makes history understandable, and calls to memory every reference we've ever heard about how history repeats itself on an individual as well as worldwide basis.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love it. I couldn't fall asleep without it. My husband loves it as well. I love all the sound options and how you can mix and match them to create your perfect relaxing melody.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|It's an excellent movie. I will certainly buy the DVD. Too bad Nolan doesn't want to make the fourth one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|all I can say is that I found my addiction..I fell in love with pinterest the moment I logged in...
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Have seen the show in a theater setting, but if<br />you can't do that, this is the next best thing!<br />You feel part of the show, lurking in the balcony<br />or down in the depths of the Opera House. The company<br />is great, breathing life and passion into each role.<br />A \\"must see\\" for Andrew Lloyd Webber fans!
B009MO5G90|5.0|With Resident Evil Retribution we are thrust into an otherworldly trip from the opening minutes of the movie. This is modern science fiction/horror that engulfs the viewer senses and does not let up throughout the whole movie.<br /><br />I give this movie high rank with the production values and I agree with some of the other positive reviewers that the movie offers excellent directing, acting, cinematography, special effects and musical score. Hats off to Paul Anderson and team for turning out another excellent science fiction/ horror offering.<br /><br />Certainly the Resident Evil movies have evolved from a more traditional horror movie to a more science fiction/horror based series, but this movie is a very entertaining example of modern cinema. I have seen the movie twice already (in 3D) and it leaves you wanting more. I especially like the ending and it sets a mysterious tone for the next movie. I cannot wait for the next movie but hopefully this 3D Blu-ray package I pre-ordered keeps me content for a while.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|My daughter thought this would be good for her little ones - not easy for them to use.  We will have to see how they adjust to this style
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Excellent faotd, will consider more from this maker for sure. Thanks Amazon for continuing to find nice apps. Only wish I could download on network so I didn't have to wait till I got home.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|a great game though sad that it only seems to work well with my kindle. my android seems to have a hard time with it though, but good game all the same.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I received some other items from this seller and I was surprised to see this Blu ray was not as described as the other ones were. They were like new. This one was not as this seller stated. I am hoping that the seller can fix this and then I will change my rating. The two is only because it came to me on time and the digital copy was as stated (rate seller).  This movie is Excellent.  My daughter and I enjoy this movie time and time again. It deserves a 5 star and then some. We had to have it in our collection.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed reading Bare to You but I did not like that it was so similar to Fifty Shades of Grey. Reflected in You is sooo much better and nothing similar to Fifty Shade story line. I couldn't put the book down even read at work between phone calls. Great story line with a lot of twist and turns/unexpecting events. Def leaves you hanging and the third one does not come out until December. Overall great book and I would recommend it to anyone.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was captivated by this book. The first one felt like a cliff hanger so i wanted to know what happened. It was a little repetitive but i still enjoyed it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait for the next one! I must say that these two books so far are better than Fifty Shades! if you liked that trilogy you will love these more!
0525953728|4.0|I bought this book for my son who is quite the \\"history buff\\".  He has thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I can't wait to read it myself.
0525953728|5.0|Knowing about what kind of planning went into the mission to get Osama Bin Laden was insightful. This book was very well written. I don't know what was all of the \\"hype\\" about the book giving away secrets of our military. It was one persons view of our \\"elite\\" military forces and what it's like to belong to this very special group. The pictures and drawings would be a plus for people who don't know about the equipment or don't watch the news.
B00914JWSW|4.0|first, the good news, the high notes not in evidence at all in her live performances of late dominate the first half of this CD which is remarkably easy to get through, i was on Track 8 in half an hour. The bad news is she may have been right the first time, as this unreleased material or at least most of it comes off as little ditties that probably didn't need to be released the first time. Even the released material from \\"A Star is Born\\" for instance seems insignificant even in comparison to other movie musicals she's done like Yentl. That said, good to hear her voice in the 60's, 70s and even the late 80s when she could perform like no other. I like to think she will again.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|This book was way too slow.  I first had a hard time getting into it but it had enough going that I had to finish it and find out what happened.  What the author said in 5 chapters could have been said in 1. It was a great idea, just executed poorly.
B008BM9L72|3.0|A fast read that gets you interested, no great depth to characters or storyline but engaging anyway.  Worth a read if you want something mindless to pass the time away.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Not what I expected from Sparks. Mediocre at best. The story dragged on and although it seems like Sparks was trying a different avenue with less romance and more self actualization, I think he should stick with what he knows.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|love it! been wanting to find a game like this! definitley keeps you busy if you are bored or wanting to pass the time  :-)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have played this app for some time now and have yet to find any flaws! The graphics are very pleasing to the eye, the music to the ears, and the challenge to the mind! :) I daresay it's even worth its price, although I got the app for free and I'm so glad I did.
B004DL5K2K|3.0|I very much agree with Red Blaze's review. For starters, this is a very highly compressed issue. In some instances I kind of like it to be compressed some so I don't have to crank up the volume knob on my stereo so much. If they  could have equalized it better and not compressed it so much and it would have turned out better (are there any good engineers around anymore)!!!??? Throughout the cd it seems to warble a bit at certain times. I heard it first on \\"I don't know\\" and I can't recall the where the others were but it happened a handful of times throughout the entire album. Could it be that the original tapes haven't been stored well and they have defects that make it warble? If that's the case the tapes aren't really old (maybe 31 years old). I've heard classical cd's that the original tapes are 60 years old without any warbling. I guess could be the overcompression coupled with a bad original master tape, but I'm not sure. And without the glitches, it does sound harsh throughout. I have the '95 remasters and the song \\"Crazy Train\\" and one other song I can't remember sounds really dull but all the other songs sound pretty darn good and crisp. I guess we may never have a perfect remaster! It just a dirty shame!! Maybe someday they will do another remaster but I won't cross my fingers!!! I'm out!!!!
B0091THRCU|2.0|I had a case like \\"the Snugg\\" on my last iPhone 4 so I figured this one would be as good on my iPhone 5. It fits great, and looks sharp!...but the stitching is very cheap. My first one they sent, the stitching was down half way on the left side of the cast by day 2. They sent me a replacement, (thinking they would check the quality before shipping) the stitching had come undone. They sent me a third and finally the stitching is together. I hope this one lasts because it is a great looking case!...I can only hope.

B002OTO38K|1.0|The acting was fair for what the movie was, but the ideas of the movie were horrific. If you are going to make a movie about some one that is transgendered, then why not get an actual transgender to do it? Also, I was offended by the fact that the boy was gay just because he was molested by his step father. Piss poor directing and story line!
B009CPEOC4|5.0|This was a good movie biography.  I have always liked Katy Perry but never really knew anything about her so watching this was nice.  I enjoyed it!

B004UNX1LS|1.0|I downloaded this program to have access to music videos on my Kindle Fire, it was a waste of my time. Videos would take an eternity to begin and then only play a few seconds and crash.  In the space of an hour I attempted to watch 4 videos, yes it seriously took 20 minutes for an attempt to load a 3 minute video only to have it glitch and lock up the Kindle after a few seconds of poorly digitized play.  No, it was not the connection for it was tried in three locations, there was something in the way the program worked, at least on my Kindle.  Perhaps it will work for you, but I cannot recommend it as it never worked for me, I deleted it in less than 3 hours of download.
034553154X|5.0|The illustrations are beautiful.  The calender combines images from the fifth book, Dance with Dragons, with images from the previous four books.  Captions are included with each picture to help identify the scene the image was constructed from.
B007V65R54|1.0|This is the worst book I have purchased from Kindle/Amazon.com...If I could have given a negative score I would have, but they only have + scores (I had to give a<br />1 star because they wouldn't let me out of the review!!!!!!!!!!!!It's tedious; gives numerous examples that just aren't pertinent to the book. I'm half-way through the book (I don't how I got this far) and I wish I hadn't started. Mr Silver seems to enjoy droppimg names of people he had contact with, just to impress the reader....which I'm not!<br />A total loss.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I liked to read the bible when needed. It keeps me on track and i can bookmark what i liked. This is from Amazon. Com
B0092SQBJA|4.0|First time through I was a bit disappointed, but after several listens I'm definitely getting into it.  I think the reason why I was a bit letdown initially was because the guitars are just not as prominent as they are on the first album.  That's a shame because Sam Halliday can really shred.  It's still a great album, just better hearing it live.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like it! It is entertaining. It is also challenging, and colorful. This is a fun game. It is a great game from Amazon.com.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|As usual, Follett's recounting of historical events from very personal perspectives is absolutely riveting. However, he fills a lot of his pages with boring fiction around the love lives of his main characters, stories that are more befitting daytime TV than a serious novel. So I was at times thrilled, at times bored, which resulted in a barely average experience.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|I just love this show, am so happy that it is back on. First show of the season and it was worth the wait, love it already, lots of action
B009DQQF7Y|5.0|As a longtime fan of mind-altering music, there are few words to describe just how I felt when, a couple weeks back, I found out that Godspeed You! Black Emperor were releasing their first album since 2002's minimalist-yet-powerful 'Yanqui U.X.O.' Though admittedly somewhat skeptical they'd be able to rekindle the magic from a decade ago, after finally hearing 'Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!'--recorded by the four core members only this time around--there are even fewer words, if any, to describe the emotions I felt while listening. But I'll do my best.<br /><br />After the quiet beauty of their last album, nothing could have prepared me for the squalling guitars that assaulted my ears during the 20-minute opener, \\"Mladic,\\" a song the band had occasionally played live, in slightly different form, before their 7-year hiatus. Following a 5-minute buildup of Middle-Eastern drones, an explosion of sound suddenly erupted from my headphones, tickling some musical funnybone in my brain, and sending me off on a euphoric innerspace journey that, hours later, I'm still feeling the effects from. The combination of grinding guitars, strings, and drums being pummeled into splinters was extremely cathartic, especially after my increasing anticipation during the slow buildup, and I was slightly worried that the album may have already peaked.<br /><br />But after more tripped-out droning on the short (relatively speaking), bagpipe-laden, almost funereal \\"Their Helicopters' Sing,\\" the epic \\"We Drifted Like Worried Fire\\" kicks it back into overdrive with an intense, just-plain gorgeous post-rock symphony that, imo, is quite possibly the high point of Godspeed's already remarkable career. Its walls of guitars and strings over an uptempo marching band drumbeat is very haunting and ominous, yet it's absolutely joyous at the same time, and--much like their musical forbears Swans' latest--induces some rather unique emotions in me, emotions that I'll only ever feel by playing this song. That's about the highest praise in my book when it comes to music, of any genre.<br /><br />Another shorter droning dirge, \\"Strung Like Lights at Thee Printemps Erable,\\" closes the album on a freaky--almost David Lynchian--note, capping off 53-minutes of pure sonic bliss. It's a little early to say where 'Allelujah!...' stands among the rest of GY!BE's repertoire, but I can definitively state that it's one of the most ambitious albums--and most immersive listening experiences--of the past few years, and should cement their status as one of the most unique, most mindblowing bands of the 21st century.<br /><br />Here's hoping we won't have to wait yet another ten years for their next album. Good thing this one should keep us all more than occupied for a very long time to come.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun so far but would be easier to see on larger screen.  Using the KF is difficult since a lot is blocked by something else!  Will continue to play and either go to 5 or back depending on how it goes.  Too early in the game to tell!
1451662432|5.0|What was surprising about this book was how smart and savvy Arnold is and has been over the years. He made his first million before even hitting it big in the movies which was mostly through good investments. You also learn a lot about the process of some of his big movie hits and the involvement he had behind the scenes in turning his movies into successes through his negotiations about how certain movies should be promoted.<br />He also addresses his failures at the box office and in his personal life, how he felt about them and what he did to try and overcome them.<br />Another surprising aspect is how involved he was in politics way before he ran for Governor, it is actually quite interesting to find out who the first person was that told him he should run for office way back in the early 90's.<br />By reading a lot of the negative reviews on amazon and through news outlets it has become pretty clear that they simply haven't read the entire book. I think they have only read the one chapter near the end which talks in detail about the 'scandal' which is a shame because there is so much more to the book than that.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone, it is a fascinating and engaging read.

B009G78EE2|4.0|Seattle rapper Macklemore (Ben Haggerty) and producer Ryan Lewis release one of 2012's surprise smashes in [[ASIN:B009G78EE2 The Heist [Explicit]]], an album expected to debut near the top of the Billboard 200 Chart. It was single \\"Thrift Shop\\" featuring Wanz that helped to propel The Heist to its lofty visibility during it debut week (released October 10, 2012).  All in all, The Heist is worth the hype, delivering solid rhymes from Mackelmore and superb production from Lewis.<br /><br />\\"Ten Thousand Hours\\" opens the effort solidly with solid production from Ryan Lewis (dusty drums, synths, inclusion of piano) and capable rhymes from Macklemore (\\"This is my world, this is my arena/the TV told me something different, I didn't believe it\\").  Followed up by an ethnic, manic production on \\"Can't Hold Us,\\" Macklemore delivers agile, quick-paced rhymes over Lewis's busy arrangement. Ray Dalton contributes vocals on the hook, while some additional sounds via trumpet, trombone, and violin prove to be nice.<br /><br />\\"Thrift Shop\\" proceeds, intact with Wanz's silly, though endearing vocal hook (\\"I'm gonna pop some tags/only got twenty dollars in my pocket/I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up/this is ____ awesome\\").  Lewis's production is superb, blending contemporary ideas with old-school sensibility - very much in underground sensibility.  Macklemore makes rhyming about a thrift shop incredibly enthralling (\\"Walk into the club like what up...Nah I'm just pumped up off some ___ from the thrift shop...\\").<br /><br />\\"Thin Line\\" features Buffalo Madonna covering the hook.  \\"Thin Line\\" keeps the momentum going, which is expanded on the excellent, gospel-oriented \\"Same Love.\\" \\"Same Love\\" features Mary Lambert delivering a powerful hook (\\"And I can't change/even if I tried/even if I wanted to...My love, my love, my love, she keeps me warm...\\"). Macklemore dives right into social issues on this cut, keeping the tone serious and the message meaningful.<br /><br />\\"Make The Money\\" makes fine use of violin and trumpet once more (performed by Andrew Joslyn and Owuor Arunga).  The production is old-school with soul leaning drum programming.  Macklemore delivers another worthy hook: \\"Make the money, don't let the money make you/change the game/don't let the game change you...forget about the fame...\\"<br /><br />\\"Neon Cathedral\\" brings in soul standout Allen Stone to deliver the chorus.  Wurlitzer is prominent here while the Seattle Rock Orchestra provides strings.  The main quibble of \\"Neon Cathedral\\" is that despite being beautiful, it is a bit `sleepy.' Lyrically, it is well penned.  \\"Bom Bom,\\" an instrumental cut proceeds featuring The Teaching.  Musically, it is quite interesting and enjoyable.  Whether it fits the scheme of the album or not is up for debate.  At nearly five minutes in duration, it is a bit lengthy for an instrumental.<br /><br />\\"White Walls\\" restores any ceded momentum on The Heist (if there was any lost), featuring Schoolboy Q and Hollis.  Ryan Lewis's production is amongst his most interesting of the album, contrasting previous cuts easily.  Hollis handles the hook while Schoolboy Q raps on the third verse.  As always, Macklemore is on his game, delivering excellent rhymes with quite a capable flow.  \\"Jimmy Iovine\\" featuring Ab-Soul concedes none of \\"White Wall's\\" momentum, continuing in excellence as Macklemore criticizes the music exec in regards to potential royalties. (\\"Along with a third of the money you make when you're out doing your shows/manager gets 20, booking agent gets 10/so ___ after taxes you and Ryan have 7% to split...\\") Wonder if Jimmy I has heard it?<br /><br />\\"Wing$\\" is another fine cut, featuring choir vocals from the Denny Middle School Choir, which adds a different dimension.  \\"A Wake,\\" featuring Evan Roman isn't bad, featuring a military-like snare drum and some more notable lyrics from Macklemore. \\"Gold,\\" featuring Eighty4 Fly possesses a nice optimism about it, without ultimately beingexceptional.  \\"Staring Over,\\" featuring Ben Bridwell of Band of Horses is average while \\"Cowboy Boots\\" ends the album interestingly, featuring banjo of all instruments.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B009G78EE2 The Heist [Explicit]]] is a solid album. It's not perfect, but there are plenty of notable moments. Macklemore delivers solid rhymes/lyrics and Ryan Lewis delivers fine production.  The guests and role players definitely contribute their share as well.  Quite enjoyable is the verdict.exceptional.  \\"Staring Over,\\" featuring Ben Bridwell of Band of Horses is average while \\"Cowboy Boots\\" ends the album interestingly, featuring banjo of all instruments.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B009G78EE2 The Heist [Explicit]]] is a solid album.

B007C9N4H8|1.0|This movie was absolutely horrible! Even for a kids movie, it was unbearable. My children could't wait to see it since we missed it in the theatres. We didn't even finish it. They thought it was stupid, thank god because I couldn't take it anymore. Glad it only cost me a few bucks from home, I would have walked out of the theatre otherwise and been out a lot more money.
B000RF1QDI|1.0|This DVD would not play on any of three players, Sony Home Theater System, Blue Ray Player and standard table top DVD player.  Very disappointed!!
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Events can reveal social splatology on levels of consciousness that defy the ego boundaries assumed by the religion of ordinary life. One kid type question in this review is about someone attacking people he doesn't know, as most of the world has fears of strangers and poison gas attacks. A scene with the hero wearing a gas mask in a subway is precisely the way I feel about the major events that are just clues for those who wonder how anybody ever got Timothy McVeigh to drive the truck.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Sussan you are a great author. i love all your books. i love how you name your books so real. likes its happening Wright were i am !!!! you make the solution so amazing.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is insanely addictive and ultimately simple at its heart. The graphics, animations, the atmosphere and the soundtrack all add up to a game that's easily worth the price you pay.

B005UA0FLE|5.0|Love this cd! Michael Buble has such an \\"old\\" sound - reminds me of Sinatra or someone of that era
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I would first like to thank all of our service men and woman who protect our freedom.<br />It is amazing how much training these Navy SEALS teams go through. I am not a avid reader but this book really kept my interest and I couldn't put it down. I found this book to be very interesting and I don't understand the whole uproar that this book created. The Navy SEAL never gave away any of our country's TOP SECRET information and he explains it in the beginning of the book that he changed all the names of the people to protect them since they are on active duty. I am so glad the USA finally found that bastard and killed him for all the killings he has promoted across the world. As it says in the book after they killed UBL that when they searched his room they found his guns on the shelf and that he didn't put up a fight and they found this to be the case that high ranking Al-Queda members are just a bunch of \\"PU$$Y$\\".<br />I would recommend this book to anyone.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game..patiently waiting enigmatis 2.<br />so if the developers are listening. HURRY UP already<br />I cant wait much longer I keep checking for it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this game is fun and addictive.  it goes above and beyond most match 3 games.as the levels process,, you really have to use strategy to clear the board. graphics and voice acting also good.
B004132HZS|5.0|Obviously, this is not the old fashioned Sherlock before computers or even fingerprinting methods, but that's what makes it great. As a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classics, I can understand that some people would be disappointed, but I encourage you to be open-minded and remind you that this is a MODERN sherlock.<br /><br />Tradition aside, I think this was so well done! The actors are fantastic and the storyline is well-adapted.<br /><br />I am completely obsessed.
0399157565|5.0|The Bone Bed had me captured for 18 consecutive hours of almost unbroken reading. Still based at the Cambridge Forensic Center, all of the usual characters are present. Her FBI Profiler husband, Benton Wesley, her niece Lucy and the ever present Marino. Lucy is still ensconced in electronic data, but she is keeping secrets from her aunt. Like wear did that heavy gold ring she is wearing come from. Marino seems to be drinking again and collecting miniature Skull Head vodka bottles and making ornaments from them. Benton, well Benton has a new partner, and he is a bit muddy with Kay about the relationship there. With the arrival of a very disturbing email and the death of a palaeontologist in Alberta, Canada, closely followed by a body found in the Charles River, attached by nets and a number of things to a leatherback turtle, and another seemingly unrelated murder, the book picks up pace quickly. I wouldn't suggest starting it at bedtime and planning on reading a chapter or two because you will have problems putting the book down. Probably what I did enjoy most about The Bone Bed as well as it's predecessor, Red Mist, is the return of Patricia Cornwell's writing style. Back again is the Scarpetta who is strong and sensitive and the intelligent woman that we had all known.  After the writing of her Jack the Ripper book, Ms Cornwell couldn't seem to pull together a cohesive writing style. The story lines and Kay Scarpetta suffered for it. We saw Scarpetta second guessing herself and seeming to need others to make a simple decision. Thankfully that is sorted and we once again have gotten Patricia Cornwell and Kay Scarpetta back at their best.
0670022411|5.0|This is the first book about vampires and witches that I have truly enjoyed and actually couldn't wait to read the second book. It has everything you could want, history,romance, excitement and drama.<br /><br />Easy to read and keeps your interest from page to page.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Very entertaining story. The characters are a little shallow, but I think it's an original with a nice surprise at the end.  I'm glad I read it and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone who enjoys diencephalic fiction.

B008602KQI|5.0|I was hooked right away! It was one of those hard to put down books. So much excitement and suspense all of the time. I am really glad I read the series.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!! It is nothing at all like the HP books and it stands very well on it's own. I had to double check the author a few times because it is so different.<br /><br />Beautifully told story that didn't go where I was expecting it to go and the ending was heart wrenching.
B008XG1X18|5.0|great app. sometimes has a hard time opening but fixes itself. I do have to go on the website version to create brand new pins though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great Book, and very unusual. Now that I've read the first book in the series, I will definitely read the other two.
B008XG1X18|5.0|enjoy all the ideas and inspiration!! full of ideas. way to also connect with those you love. great app!! love it...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|You do NOT have to purchase coins to play this. I am on level 100 and it has only taken a week and a half to get there.  I now get coins every 23 seconds and I am up to 78 coins as my Max.  There is no reason to rate this game anything below 4 stars.  It may be slow in the beginning but with all the regeneration bonuses it levels up quick.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching fire was one of the most action pack best book ive ever read. Its an maybe even better than the hunger games and I definitely would recommend reading it
B008G8SFGO|5.0|After being mildly disappointed with Sonic Boom, I didn't have great expectations about Monster.  Instead, I found myself really enjoying it.  There are no instant classics on it (although \\"All For The Love Of Rock & Roll\\" comes close), but there are no songs that I want to skip either (like the last three songs of Psycho Circus).  The thing I like most about this album is the return to riff-driven songs.  In the 80's, KISS moved more towards power chords and away from the riffs that gave their 70's a distinctive sound.  There are still plenty of power chords on Monster, but songs like \\"Wall of Sound\\" remind me of the KISS I fell in love with as a teen.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I flew through the first book in the trilogy in a weekend because of how great it was, so I instantly purchased the second book instantly. This book is a little slow in the beginning- it took about 50 pages for her to recap the previous book and set the stage for the action in Catching Fire, but trust me, it's there. And this book, even though it took me two weekends to read because I was busy, was better than the first! Enjoy!
B006DRVFRQ|3.0|I would really like to purchase the pro version of this app.... but can not find it. :( help? The pro version will make it 5 stars for me.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Being born in 1976 and being a technophile for the duration I fit the target audience of this book to a T.  When he describes the various 80's pop references I watched, read and listened to all of them.  Same with all of the various arcade, console and microcomputer games.  I played Zork, Galaga and Joust and Ms Pacman etc.  I am just disappointed there was no reference to the Ultima series but i suspect I know why.<br /><br />Fast forward to today and I am familiar with the MMO market and all that entails.  In short, I am about as suited to understand and appreciate this book as is possible.  In no small way did the subject matter resonate with me and in that it worked.<br /><br />As an engineer by trade, my literary analysis is somewhat limited.  I found the characters compelling, the plot over the top but what did you really expect, I like the pacing in that I was not cutting ahead as I often find myself doing because I am bored with how we are getting there, and the narrative truly did immerse me as I imagine teh author might appreciate.<br /><br />That being said, I do not know how someone who is not me will take it.  When he describes going into the Zork setting for example.  I played that game so I can fill in those gaps so to speak.  I do not know how that would crossover for someone else.  I liked it a whole hell of a lot though so take that for what it is worth.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The Maze Runner has an intriguing premise that pulls you into the confusion and wonder of the characters.  The story develops in such a manner as to allow the reader to feel the characters growth, fear, determination and amazement.  [[ASIN:0385737955 The Maze Runner (Book 1)]]
B0007O38XU|5.0|I love this movie! It came on time and play's great. Spaceballs is perhaps the best Sci-fi spoof of all time.<br />It has already been mentioned that it spoofs Star Wars, Star Trek, Planet of the Apes, but it really spoofs nearly every big Sci-fi movie ever.
B008H5J510|5.0|Excellent, a great movie, it's amazing how a woman, GET WITH THE STRENGTH OF YOUR DREAMS AND YOUR HEART, AND SUCCESS WITHOUT FORGETTING FAME origin, and how despite the obstacles, GET UP AND outdo itself, WHY AS she says, there's a part of us, who shines as a Firework and that no one can take ... Great film, excellent editing, sound and images are amazing, LES WILL get the willies ... TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Having seen Alien quite a few years ago and becoming an instant fan, this film pretty much answered all of my questions about where the ship came from.  It tied together where we came from; where the alien ship came from; and where the alien came from.<br /><br />Loved the 3D version. The technology of the future seemed very realistic.  It was somewhat predictable, but still very entertaining.  I am not going to go into every plot.  I just recommend it.  The special effects are top rate.  The sound is amazing, the special features are really great.
B004JMY312|1.0|Very poorly done. Intelligence level was insulting. Too much hype for poor quality movie. Not at all what we expected.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|IF YOU LOVE THE EAGLES THEN THIS DVD IS A 'MUST'.  ALL THE GREAT HITS AND A FEW OTHER SURORUSES AND JOE WALSH CONTINUES AS THE SCENE STEALER.  EVERYONE THAT I HAVE SHOWN THIS DVD TO LOVES IT.
0375413405|5.0|How does one review a book that has been around for this long? I purchased after watching \\"Julie and Julia\\", for the second time! Obviously it is void of glossy pictures, that one expects to find in modern cook books. However, it's basic, no nonsense approach to some classic French dishes is an excellent starting point for anyone wishing to expand their level of home cooking. Buy it, have fun with it and then eat in Julia's honor!
0345803485|5.0|I couldn't put the book down once I started, it's and emotional roller coaster kind of read, that will leave you wanting more and more and making your fall for every single character, from a helicopter to a very wealthy man known as Christian Grey. You will love it and will want everyone around you to read it too, after all you want to have someone to talk about it with!!! The Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy is definitely on top of my reading list, Mr.Grey will leave you wanting &#34;more&#34;.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Very good movie. A little slow at first. The CG was fairly good. I always enjoy the extra footage on how the film was shot. You can't take the Battleship sequence too literal.
1451627289|3.0|WARNING - May Contain SPOILERS !<br /><br />I'm not a Horror / King fanatic, but I did read The Shining years ago and enjoyed it.  I am a science-fiction fan, however, so when I heard this was a Time-Travel story, I was in.<br /><br />While I was reading the book, I became increasingly frustrated with it because it contains TOO MUCH DETAIL !  I appreciate that King is a great writer, but do I need to know every stinking detail about every darn incident or character in the book?  My answer is NO.  About a third of the way into the book, I was so frustrated with it, that instead of abandoning it, I decided to read it as quickly as I could, just to get through the darn thing!<br /><br />There is a reason that a lot of time-travel stories are SHORT stories.  Authors get in, they make their point, and get out.  This book was just laborious in it's detail, and it really turned me off.  If you cut 100-300 pages out of this book, it would have been a leaner, more efficient, effective read.<br /><br />Heck, when I first saw the book, I thought it was as big and heavy as a phone book!  (I don't do the Kindle, I prefer to have a real book to carry around.  Call me old-school).<br /><br />The idea of going back to save JFK is one of the oldest time-travel ideas in the world.  King was either crazy or brave to tackle this one.<br /><br />One problem I had with the book was the dialog.  It didn't sound like real people talking.  It was \\"book conversation\\" where characters need to get the exposition across in their dialog.  In other words, the dialog sounded phony, stilted and too cute, and it's not how real people talk to each other.<br /><br />Speaking of corny dialog, just wait 'til you get to the love story!  The bedroom dialog between Jake and Sadie is many times \\"cringe-worthy\\" and makes you just roll your eyes for being \\"too cutesy\\".  Does King really think that people talk to each other this way?  Or is he just wishing that people did?  Either way, their dialog is cornierthan a corn-dog!<br /><br />One particular scene that I thought was completely unbelievable was when Jake sang \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" out loud without thinking, and because of this, his girlfriend KNEW he was from a different time!  Weak!  How preposterous can you get?<br /><br />Also, the idea of changing the past which causes ramifications in the future is nothing new as well.  I did like that King did give us a glimpse of an alternate reality later in the book.<br /><br />Having said that, I did come to like the main character, Jake, and was sad when the book ended, even though he does some evil things in this book.  And how could Sadie ever love a man that admitted to committing murder?  I'm not sure I ever entirely bought that.<br /><br />The ending did not give me that \\"Wow\\" moment or even a \\"chill\\" like great novels do.  As others pointed out, it was tied-up very \\"matter of factly\\" and seemed to have been tied-up very quickly.<br /><br />I did think that Jake would end up being the Yellow Card Man, possibly stuck in time, but the YCM turned out to be something entirely different.<br /><br />Give King credit for not going with a typical Hollywood \\"happily ever after\\" ending, which is probably what most people wanted.  But how in the world could they possibly make a movie out of this thing anyway?  Some serious trimming is going to have to be done, or it will be a four-hour movie!  Good luck on that one.<br /><br />All in all, I ultimately semi-enjoyed the book, even though I was very frustrated with it big time in the middle third.

B005LAIHSQ|3.0|In past movies we have seen several different off takes form the original Snow White story. Each has its strengths. And as with Shakespeare each generation of contemporary actors have to try their hand at it. We have seen the cartoon version and even vicious witches and giant midget versions. This version displays the advances in CGI and loud noise between the dialogs forcing you to keep your finger on the volume control.<br /><br />In this story we see Ravenna (Charlize Theron) was deprived as a child. Her mother told her that you can have everything if you just maintain your beauty. She strives to have it all by overcompensating and in the process a few people will have to be dispatched and others suffer their own depravation, oops deprivation.<br /><br />Ravenna needs to obtain Snow White's heart to maintain that cute smirk. But for some reason Snow White (Kristen Stewart) prefers to keep her own heart right where it is and escapes with it to the black forest. Ravenna sends a forest savvy huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) to bring back Snow White. Confronted with Snow's demise the huntsman becomes her ally in recovering her kingdom from its usurper.<br /><br />We as viewers have to decide just whose side we are on. Even Snow feels sorry that she cannot share her heart.

B008PE9GSA|4.0|I don't know if ZZTop even has to record any more.  The time they wait between releases suggests they don't sign multiple album deals, which means they put out a record approximately whenever they feel like it.  \\"La Futura\\" is vintage ZZTop, given a slightly cleaner sheen as opposed to their last album \\"Mescalaro\\", which, for my tastes, practically drowned itself in a super muddy production.<br />  \\"I Gotsa To Get Paid\\" starts out with what has become Billy Gibbons' preferred super distorted guitars, making one think they're in for another sludgy record like their last handful.  However, producer Rick Rubin has helped them to rise out of that muck somewhat and the results make a more enjoyable CD.  \\"Chartreuse\\" is the real nod back to ZZTop's earlier days, sounding somewhat like \\"Tush\\" in its swinging rhythm and Gibbon's usual superb slide guitar.  Another surprising cut, the ballad \\"Over You\\" recalls the days of \\"Rough Boy\\" and even has some strings or synthesizers in the background, adding a nice melodic touch to a very tender song.  As always, the guitar solo is stately and shows how choice of notes makes a world of difference.<br />  If there is a mild criticism, it would have to be \\"Flyin' High\\".  This song sounds too much like a modern country tune and unfortunately lacks anything original in it.  Even the solo doesn't help this by-the-numbers stinker.<br />  Otherwise, \\"La Futura\\" is the work of a blues band aging gracefully and fully embracing their musical heritage.  It's much shorter than \\"Mescalaro\\", which is good, because that album went on too long.  ZZTop are an American institution and with the exception of \\"Flyin' High\\" have made a much better album than they have in a while.  And even my disliking \\"Flyin' High\\" is only my opinion.  I could learn to like it later with repeated listenings.  Get yourself a slice of the real blues deal.

0374214913|3.0|This novel is slightly elevated from the formulaic mystery series abounding. Instead of a mystery about a bakery or home renovation this is a mystery about a secret society.<br />Mr Sloan has taken the time to give the characters some \\"clever\\" names such as Deckle, Clay and of course Penumbra.<br />The book was alright. It simply is not a profound nor elevated novel of insight. The truth of the novel is \\"hidden in plain sight.\\"

B00684J49U|5.0|Love It!, the package came in perfect condition in the time it was set to arrive and without problems. I like very much this serie and was expecting this season to buy it, I would probably buy the next season as soon it is in the market.
B005HEPJBO|3.0|The primary reason to watch this episode is to take in Jeri Ryan's spot on recreation of Robert Picardo's EMH Doctor. Her facial expressions, vocal inflections, and mannerisms of the Doctor are almost too good. `Body and Soul' establishes the Doctor as an iconic Star Trek persona. When a character in a TV show can still be a joy to watch even when being acted by different actor, it shows just how well defined that character's personality and traits are.<br /><br />Yet, my gripe with the episode is that it presents the Doctor as really selfish and dumb. That's somewhat of a, \\"Well duh\\" statement, but something about him abusing Seven's body for his own gain just came off as immoral to me. I kept thinking back to `Retrospect' and how angry Seven (and the Doctor) felt about her person being violated against her will. You would think the Doctor would be aware of Seven's history, but instead it's played for laughs.<br /><br />Positive Points<br /><br />- The Doctor telling Seven she needs to indulge more. What's the point of being human then? Come on girl, get crazy!<br /><br />- That New York cheesecake looked delicious.<br /><br />Negative Points<br /><br />- The actual way in which the Doctor takes over Seven's body makes no sense. So you could put any holo-character into Seven and they would take over her body? Imagine the possibilities.

B005HEWO2G|2.0|`Inside Man' doesn't feel like an episode of Voyager. It comes across more as a lesser episode of `TNG', which is odd, because I find Reg Barclay episodes to be pretty good.<br /><br />A hologram of Barclay (created by Barclay) is hijacked by some Ferengi, sent to Voyager, charms the pants off the crew, and presents them with a plan to get home that involves diving into stars. The Ferengi want Seven of Nine's probes, as they're worth mad profit. Barclay soon starts to realize something is up with his hologram, calls up Troi for help, and tries to figure out what's happening.<br /><br />The Voyager crew is a non-factor throughout the episode. They're basically in it to swoon over Holo-Reg, as a kind of reversal of Reg's usual outgoing confidence when interacting with holograms, but with him now being the fake one. It's territory we've seen multiple times already, as it comes across as total retread.<br /><br />The real plot is back in the Alpha quadrant, as Barclay, Troi, and Starfleet try to thwart the Ferengi from sending Voyager on a death flight. It's nice to see some of the classic gang and that's all it is - seeing some old buds. `Inside Man' could never have been made and we wouldn't have lost anything.<br /><br />Positive Points<br /><br />- Hanging around with Reg and Troi again is always nice. Also, seeing Richard McGonagle (of the `Uncharted' trilogy) is cool too.<br /><br />Negative Points<br /><br />- A regression from the strides Barclay took forward in the previous Voyager episode `Pathfinder.' So, all of the confidence and successes Reg got in that episode was dropped and we're back to this? Kind of weak.<br /><br />- The way Voyager falls for Holo-Reg is pretty corny, but then this is Star Trek.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Not the most exciting of Reacher....lacks the usual detailed rough stuff that makes Reacher so cool. Still well worth the read.
B009MO5ES8|4.0|***Contain Spoilers***<br /><br />I thought this was an interesting movie. I have never seen such a movie about bike messenger/delivery in New York. Maybe there is another movie like this, but this is the first one I know. If you know another feel free to name it and maybe I watch that one too.<br /><br />I will talk about the action first. There is plenty! All the action is done on the bike, and it's pretty good. The main Male protagonist, Wilee, knows a lot stunts and mixes it up to do all the action scenes. You kind of have to let yourself believe that this one guy that is a bike messenger also knows how to do all these motocross stunts and tricks. But in another way, maybe it does make perfect sense. The way the movie makes out the job of bike messengers, Wilee does need to know all these tricks and stunts just to stay alive doing his job. Seems like bike messengers can be easily killed or serious injured doing what he does everyday by people walking, cars, or anything really on the road. All because they need to ride hard and fast to do their job.<br /><br />What I really liked about the movie was this interesting \\"future look\\" Wile does. You will see him riding his bike and then he sees a situation where has many choices on the \\"paths he could take\\". Then, you see how each \\"path he could take\\" would do. Most of the paths lead him killing himself or getting seriously injured until he figures out, a path he would take that didn't get him killed or injured...most of time that is. It is possible that all paths are just plain bad. lol<br /><br />Another thing I found interesting about the movie was how it the movie is played/shown to the audience. The movie doesn't follow a total linear path from start to finish. Instead, what it does is shows the audience a point of view (mainly Wilee's point of view) and continues on from there. So, the movie will back up and show you what happened before all of the present/current event and tell you how this character/event happened because of the previous character/event happened. This lets the audiences know why and how the things got the way they were. I was kind of worry about the movie doing this at first because it would slow down the action, but instead it was done right because they mixed in some action scenes with it and kind of speed up things. Bravo!<br /><br />I liked how there was a happy ending at the end. And it wasn't forced either. Many times I would see a movie that had a have a happy ending, but it would seemed possible to get to that happy ending from how they stacked the deck against the protagonist. But, this movie did it right! They stacked the deck against Wilee, but the obsoletes, he had to face actually worked against each other too. Wilee saved the day and end all the whole mess of having a crazy/bad cop chasing him throughout New York for a ticket that had special meaning on it. He had to get it to China Town to and give it to this person named sister Chan. Wilie also has all these other sub problems he has to deal with, but it could be solved easily, but just get away. The main problem is with the cop that needs to get the ticket and pay off his money debts. And Wildly has the ticket. On top of that, the cop has his own problems because if he doesn't get the ticket then he owes too much money to the mobsters to pay back and he would just get killed. This works out for Wilee at the end for a happy ending because he just needs to delivery the ticket to sister Chan and there's no backlash for Wilee. The cop will just die because he did not get the ticket and the mobsters will kill the cop and they don't care about Wilee.<br /><br />Also, a big plus where the story set up for the protagonist to get the girl at the end too and how everything just seemed to fall in the right place in the right way. This seems like a easy tasks to make in a movie, but I seen plenty of movie that \\"tries\\" to do this, but it doesn't work. This movie made it work! Watch it!
B007KZY1YY|1.0|I'm far from a prude - hell I've had dinner time conversations laughing about the surgical removal of toilet brushes and chicken drumsticks from inappropriate places (we'll save this one for later folks) - so for me, jumping on the band wagon and reading the `Fifty Shades of Grey' trilogy seemed like a good easy read to fill in between real books.  Having just finished the third one (yes, I stuck it out till the end), I am utterly disappointed and bewildered as to how someone has made so much money and received so much hype from this completely rubbish trilogy.<br /><br />Basic plot for all you who haven't given in to the hype yet......<br />Christian Grey is a 28 year old billionaire businessman who owns lots of companies, flies helicopters, gliders, owns boats and apartments everywhere, plays the piano like Mozart and drives round in super flash cars.  If this isn't enough he is also apparently the sexiest man on the planet.  Sound too good to be true?  It is.  He is into BDSM and all sorts of kinky stuff that the author shoves down your throat every couple of pages - think spanking, handcuffs, riding crops and all manner of things that I just can't put into a review my grandmother might come across.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele is a 22 year old shy, undergraduate student who Christian wants as his `submissive', someone who has to do EXACTLY as he says and gets punished if she doesn't do it right.  Long story short, they fall in love, get married have a couple of kids and have sex at least 500 times throughout this poor excuse of literature.<br /><br />Well done, you've pretty much just read the entire three books.<br /><br />I found myself skipping through all this nonsense, a good five pages at a time to see if there was a storyline underneath - there isn't.  On top of it all, it is terribly written and full of repetitiveness.<br /><br />Save yourselves the time, money and lesson on what a butt plug is for and choose something else to read, this is by far the worst book I have ever picked up.

B0055MBQOM|2.0|I needed my displays calibrated before I sent some of my work to print and was really undecided between the ColorMunki Display and the Spyder4 Pro. I did a LOT of research online trying to pit one against the other but there wasn't any real comparison available. I finally ordered the ColorMunki Display primarily because of 3 reasons:<br />1. It wasn't clear whether the Spyder4Pro supports multiple computers. The product description says that it supports multiple displays but nothing is mentioned about multiple computers.<br />2. At the time I made the purchase, ColorMunki Display had a mail-in rebate going on.<br />3. Another reviewer said that the hardware is really the same as i1Display Pro which comes highly recommended.<br /><br />Now about the product. The hardware is really sleek and sits comfortably on the screen without scratching it. I did not install the software from the CD that came with the product, I installed the latest version from Xrite website. There is a prompt for registering the software but it's not mandatory and I recommend skipping it until you're sure that you're not returning the product. It can automatically identify if you've more than one displays. There're two calibration modes offered, \\"Easy\\" and \\"Advanced\\". In the \\"Advanced\\" mode, it lets you choose the White Point and Brightness a.k.a. Luminance. If you are unsure, just go with the industry recommended setting of D65 (6500 K) and 120 cd/m2 respectively. At some point, it asks you the backlight type for your monitor which you'll do good to know because that helps create a more accurate profile. It also asks if you'd like to measure the ambient light and screen flare. Then the software guides you through the process using a set of easily followable onscreen instructions. At the end of the process, which takes about 5 minutes, it creates a custom display profile and saves it. Finally, it shows you several stock pictures to compare the newly created display profile and the default display profile.<br />In my case, I calibrated a late 2011 MacBook Pro and a Dell U2312HM display. A brown hue was imparted on the MBP, while the Dell display was calibrated satisfactorily. There wasn't a world of difference as some other reviewers claimed but I guess that is a subjective opinion. I recalibrated the MBP under different light conditions and at different times of the day but the end result always had the brown hue. I returned the product and got the Spyder4 Pro which fared pretty well compared to the ColorMunki Display.<br />There are some reports of the software having a memory leak on Mac OS X and increasingly claiming more memory if the computer is left running for days. However, I left my computer running for 2 days but did not see more than 20 MB used by the software when idle. I run a Mac OX Mountain Lion v 10.8.2.<br />The software does get added to your startup items and arguably adds a few seconds to login time. However, that can be disabled with little effort.y profile.<br />In my case, I calibrated a late 2011 MacBook Pro and a Dell U2312HM display.

B005LAIHZE|2.0|The essential idea behind this film is twisted enough that it should have been very good.  Unfortunately, the execution of the idea was lacking in many, many ways.  Its essentially a flood of over-the-top computer generated combat that left me yawning and only the most labored attempt at any character building.  The story itself was practially non-existient.  There also weren't any key moments that left you thinking that plowing through the visuals was worth anything.  For the most part, its a 2-hour video game trailer, without any real purpose or meaning.  I was left feeling empty because the concept had lots of potential and it could have been so much better.

B005LAIHY0|2.0|All the spectacle and beauty on the screen was undone by the moron actions of the \\"scientists\\" on the Prometheus team. This script is an insult to scientists.

B004BQVGHK|4.0|Think of a romantic era such as World War I when dashing young pilots flew for the Lafayette Escadrille.  Porco Rosso, the hero of the film, is just such a dashing figure who loves a beautiful chanteuse he can never have because he has the face of a hog.  He received this curse in an air battle in the war and has had to live with it since. The whole film is pure art. The color is beautiful and the characters are well-developed.  Only the master, Miyazake, could have come up with this tale of heroism and romance and applied it in such an entertaining format.  The music sounds like the French songs of Edith Piaf.  And as usual, Miyazake supplies a major female character who has as much time and appeal in the story as does the hero.  This isn't your standard American cartoon.  Disney Studios recognized Miyazake's genius and purchased his Ghibli Studios so that he could help Disney evolve into his realm.  Adults who have never seen anime will like Porco Rosso.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Have you ever seen anything narrated by David Attenborough that was not exceptional?  I have not.  This is like Planet Earth Part II.

The author is not boastful but honest and tells what it was like being in special forces as well as the facts when Osama bin Laden was killed.  The book was written without given up military secrets.  I think Americans should read this just to know the training and hard work these guys do so we have a safer America.

B009AJDDQU|1.0|Overwhelmingly this movie fell far short of its potential.  I was disappointed with the disjointed plot lines and the overwhelming lack of attention to detail.  It was frustrating to see the culmination of what began as a genre maker (Alien) come to this.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I read the Secret and saw the DVD when it first came out. It was a \\"giant leap for mankind.\\" You won't look at your world the same way after reading and truly understanding the premise of the secret. It's hard to swallow at first:  after all, it's hard to admit that the life you are currently living is one that YOU have created! There are two novels out now that will help you absorb the concepts first introduced in the SECRET and that will make you understand them even more. Sometimes truths are better told through fiction. Check out \\"Legs in the Attic\\" and \\"The Man Who Couldn't Dream\\" after you read the Secret. Your life will never be the same.

The result: hands down better than what they've had on network TV before. The spoken voices necessarily reveal the limitations of the original recording, but the remastered sound effects all but belie the low budget on which this movie was produced.<br /><br />I haven't even checked out the disc 2 features; I definitely should make time for what looks like a considerable amount of added collector's value. But just the 91 minutes of the movie were worth the purchase. Watch out, Haddonfield, IL...he's still gonna get you!!

B00936A0ZW|5.0|OK -first listen;<br />Having not found any real pre-release info, I had expected the album to be all instrumental, but only 4 of the 11 tracks were. 3 of them original, and the 4th, the excellent Brubeck classic \\"Blue Rondo a la Turk\\", is a rare Jazz entry for Gilbert. A very worthy track, both as an example of his talent and versatility as a guitar player, and as an example of a succesfully concieved fusion track that would do any top player in the genre proud. The track is followed by another genre departure; the R&B-tinged \\"Atmoshpere on the Moon\\".<br /><br />Keyboardplayer/Wife Emi has a wonderful jazzy workout on the next track \\"The Pronghorn\\". She gets ample space throughout the studio tracks, as do the other musicians; Kelly Lemieux (bass) and Thomas Lang (drums) - and they are solid throughout.<br /><br />The last 3 tracks are excellent live cuts; an outstanding and faithful \\"Roundabout\\" (the Yes classic), the old school Willie Dixon blues number \\"I want(s) to be loved\\" ending in an over the top Gilbert-solo extravaganza.<br />Paul generously introduces the last song; AC/DC's \\"Go Down\\" as the \\"best song in the world\\" and totally kills with it as a closing number of his Stockholm show, trading tasty Young-flavoured licks with Tony Spinner of his 2010 touring band. The live tracks really drive home how entertaining Paul is as a musician and how infectiously enthusiastic his approach is - to every note and inflection he puts forth (and as every Gilbert fan knows - he manages a LOT of them in every song)!<br /><br />You get rock, jazz, blues and prog - all excellently concieved and executed by the one of the best players ever!<br /><br />Thanks Paul - another winner! Hope to see you soon in NYC again!

B008NB0SQO|1.0|Disney has ruined THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL yet again by only including the cut theatrical release version of the movie, minus the song When Love is Gone. This is a song that not only is the heart and soul of the entire movie, but it was at one point added back into the film BY THE DIRECTOR, Brian Henson. Nobody involved in the production wanted the song removed -- it was taken out by the studio because they felt little kids would get bored during it. As it is, the film still has an awful cut where that song was supposed to be...and the intended, full version of the film will remain sitting on a studio shelf because Disney wants it that way. Pathetic.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|When my wife and I first saw the previews of this movie, we started looking for a theater where it was showing.  We just couldn't find it.  About two months after the release, we finally found that it was showing at a theater 75 miles from our home.  We drove the 75 miles, watched the movie, and loved it.  The casting company deserves a special round of applause.  I don't believe they could have picked a better cast.  It is a wonderful, funny, sad, laugh out loud, get misty eyed movie.<br /><br />I puchased the DVD as a birthday gift for my wife.  Her birthday is November 1st, so she hasn't received the gift.  Please don't tell her, it would spoil the surprise.

B005S9ELM6|5.0|This is a superb film. Well-acted, brilliantly directed, and a pleasure during every minute. I had the good fortune of meeting Tony Mendez while living in DC. (And his wife Jonna, who he has co-authored several books with.) As a former graduate student in International Affairs, and as someone with some good background on the subject and some of the people involved, I can assure you that this is an accurate -and very honest- portrayal of this unique (or perhaps all too familiar) time in modern history. The film opens with a solid background of our somewhat checkered past with Iran, then moves on to how the budding theocratic government allows the situation to go terrifyingly awry. Caught in the middle are six members of the US diplomatic crew who manage to escape the embassy during the overthrow and take refuge with the Canadian mission in Tehran. (In my travels, I am always amazed at the decency and generous character of Canadians.) In their desperation to reclaim their Foreign Service officers -who will be tortured and murdered if captured- the State Department turns to the CIA and Mr. Mendez -a specialist in exfiltration. (Mr. Mendez also worked in \\"documents\\" and in disguise development at other points in his career.) The story is all the better for being absolutely true, and a wonderful example of the creativity and, yes, deviousness of our intelligence services in The US.<br />  If there is one, understandable, but nevertheless silly part in the film, it relates to security personnel pursuing a departing Boeing 747 in airport vehicles. (I'm a professional pilot.) This is a bit ridiculous because the rotation (or lift-off) speeds of that aircraft are between 160-180 knots (roughly 180+mph) so there is no chance of catching the jet after it advances its thrust levers and has had a few seconds to accelerate. (Also it produces a huge amount of wake turbulence.) This is completely forgivable theater meant to maintain the wonderful and energetic pace of the film. No points lost for that. In contrast, while the entire film is superb (and I mean ALL of it), I must point out one of my favorite moments: the visit to the Bazaar. Having traveled in the Middle East, this part of the film captures perfectly the sometimes nerve-wracking experience to be had in potentially hostile places. Wonderful. Top marks to Mr. Affleck.

B005NWHE0O|4.0|Even though I'm a sports fan, I enjoyed reading Beyond Birkie Fever, a non-fictional story focused on the author's history with one of North America's biggest skiing competitions named the American Birkebeiner. Affectionately called Birkie by skiers from all over the world, Walter Rhein chronologies the birth of Birkie--a humorous competition between two friends--to its expanse through the Wisconsin wilderness as a premiere cross-country ski race.<br /><br />Though Rhein talks about the harshness of skiing, he delivers a documental story filled with humor and quirkiness. It's an easy ride through Beyond Birkie Fever, even through the trials and tribulations. Readers will appreciate the drama of mundane moments in Rhein's life, from buying a pair of discounted skis to tackling the icy slopes of competing in the Birkie several times. Rhein's regular life outside of skiing proves to be interesting and comedic, breaking readers away from a purely ski-friendly audience.<br /><br />While the book is still a ski book, Beyond Birkie Fever offers many definitions and explanations to skiing and skiing equipment that most novices would get boggled by. I didn't know the first thing between cross-country skiing and freestyle skiing. To me, it's all skiing, but to the author, there are different styles and techniques in skiing, just like in other sports. Rhein spelled out each style in a clear, easy-to-imagine manner. This book is positively the best ski book for the non-skiing audience.<br /><br />One of the best features of Beyond Birkie Fever is its story-telling. The narrator provides a fun energy to each vivid scene while maintaining a firm grasp of reality. It's almost like the author is telling a friend how Birkie came to be. Some of the expressions that Rhein uses are funny enough to pull out chuckles from readers.<br /><br />I can see why Beyond Birkie Fever has risen above the sporting books crowd, looking down at the rest of them from the ski lift.
B008ANFRGQ|2.0|In the world of guitarists you have many types, people who are virtuosos (Vai, Satriani, Eddie Van Halen) use no book, throw it completely out the window and play even by ear. You have people with very unique recognizable styles (Eric Clapton, Slash, BB King, Stevie Ray Vaught etc), who aren't \\"super guitarists\\" but good in their own right. And strictly by the book guitar players (Tony McAlpine, John Petrucci, Jeff Loomis, Chris Broderick), Berkley school of music by the book perfectionists. Which can become boring quick. The two super \\"solo\\" guitarists who started all this without a doubt were Vai and Satch, with Hendrix and Halen paving the path before them. While Satriani has enjoyed huge success through the years and given lessons to countless people, and many great albums, Vai has remained \\"around\\" as i would say with some notable and not so notable albums. Vai has the very trippy, unique, 70's Frank Zappa style guitar playing, and out of key, odd chord progressions, along with various effects to boot. This can be very cool, but also very annoying. The best album Vai has/had ever done was definitely Passion And Warfare IMO, and hasn't done much since that you can listen all the way through and say wow that's just a great album to put in from beginning to end. While Satch on the other hand makes albums you can listen to, hum along to, and just listen to again and again. And his song writing ability, and creativity far surpasses Vai.<br /><br />I think Vai is an excellent, technically proficient guitarist with some wild ideas, and super creativity. But as i said that doesn't always make it an enjoyable listen, as much as a lot of out of key noise. There are some slightly enjoyable tracks including Velorum, The Moon and I, and Chasing the world. And they are much more simplistic than the rest of the album. Other artists who do this type of, what i call over dramatic, quirky crazy playing are \\"animals as leaders\\", \\"Devin Townsend\\" (mostly his singing and song writing), and even someone like Tony McAlpine with his strange combinations of Jazz and whatever you want to call it. So this is just another album much like the ones he's done over the last 15 years or more. Most songs have no direction for a straight through \\"calm enjoyable listen\\". And this music is without a doubt an acquired taste. All these guitar players are good in their own ways but Vai just isn't one that i can tolerate anymore. I like the more straight forward, hum along, tab your foot to guitar playing. And the only band i've really heard do this type of music right and make it great is Mastodon (along with their brilliant song writing skills and singing). Get rid of all the wild sound effects Steve, and just make some good guitar music, we all know you can.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you‘ve ever watched the movie 9 & 1/2 Weeks and wished you could have seen more, then this book is for you!!!  Although there are a lot of “you dummy“ moments, the book is still enticing .
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Its a great movie that has a good lesson for all fathers. It had funny parts and sad parts well written. A must watch for fathers.
B0053O89JM|2.0|I have followed all of the House seasons from season 1. I am a huge House fan, and I was more than disappointed with Season 8. It ruined House for me. The acting from the new cast was terrible and the script was bad. House's character didn't have his usual wit.<br />The season was not really about the medical cases, it was mostly useless drama with random cases thrown in the background.<br />As far as I am concerned, House ended with Season 7, and Season 8 is just a mistake.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Act of Valor is a fantastic movie that uses real tactics and equipment, It started out as a short recruitment film until they realized they could make it a full length feature film. Unlike most Hollywood films this movie is mostly live fire oppose to blank firing guns or flash paper guns. The rifles are real and the bullets are real and the film is great it was certainly refreshing to see that all the vehicles and equipment was real. This film is probably the closest you will get to seeing what SEALs do without going and joining their elite ranks. The plot is very simple: The SEALs are trying to stop a madman. I would certainly like to address a something many people and critics complained about...the acting. Yeah the acting did lack slightly but you have to remember these guys are SEALs not actors. Their trained to be warriors not actors so yeah i expect the lines to be a little forced and uncomfortable. But you know what? no actor could do the combat scenes as well as the real deal did. Because just as SEALs aren't trained to act, actors are not trained in combat tactics. While actors are trained in basic things before starting a war movie quite often their IA (Immediate Action: what a warrior is trained to do when fired upon) is lacking and unsatisfactory. Actors don't have the smoothness like the real SEALs which all comes down to its what SEALs have been trained for.<br /><br />Overall the acting in my opinion doesn't make the movie lack at all. I think far too many people are getting spoiled with these movies that come out nowadays with intense acting and complex plots (such as inception). The slight awkwardness in the SEALs acting is more than offset by the intense action scenes and the realism of the film and its equipment. This film is a must have for military members/vets/military buffs/guys who want to become SEALs/ or your action junky who likes war movies.<br /><br />The realism wins this film many points in my book.<br /><br />5/5 Stars Outstanding action packed adrenaline ride that puts you next to one of our finest fighting forces.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave this five stars because it kept my attention, and I mean at the edge of my seat, and I thought about even when I wasn't reading. it has been a long time since a book kept me this  enthralled.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is wonderful its so addicting. i play it everyday. as soon as i wake up untill i go to bed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun, and gives you something to do curbing the day! enjoy it and have fun, nothings better than a little compition!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I am new to the excitement of playing games on your phone and Kindle Fire. This game is fun for me as I learn what to do.  The story line is kind of informative and adds to the game.  It is nice that you can skip the intro part and get right into the game so that it does not get old.  I am glad I started with the hints as this helps in learning the game.  You can always turn off the hints in settings once you get the hang of it.<br /><br />Also you can continue playing after you have collected all the crystals, so you find ways to make rows of four and save your bombs and other bonuses.  Unfortunately it also get harder - which is good for you people who like to be challenged.  The first round is challenging enough for me.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoy playing on the Kindle Fire.  I like the colors...and oddly enough I kind of get into the sound.
0345803485|3.0|I did not like this book; it was very slow and dragging. It came in a timely manner and was brand new but I wont be purchasing the rest of the trilogy.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Its xmore difficult than it seems. I must be having fun because I've had to recharge my Fire twice since I started!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of this style game but the beautiful graphics held my attention.  The breaks between the game seemed unnecessary and a little too simple.  Some variety there would have gotten a 5 star from me.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|This Blu-ray is testament as to why I don't subscribe to pay television.  I read the reviews and then I wait for it to come onto Blu-ray.  I did the same with Homeland.  This way I choose what I watch and when and pay only for those programs.  To hell with pay television.  Blu-ray and DVD frees me from all that crap.  Great show and great Bluray set.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I love the Batman series of films with Christian Bale but this ending to the series was disappointing for me. The bad guy's voice was unintelligible. The story line disjointed and Batman had left the scene. The best part of the movie is Cat Woman. She's sexy, she's smart and she's more interesting than the villain or the Batman. Yes, there are some spectacular action scenes. Scenes that are getting to be very predictable. A massive implosion. Stealing a prisoner off an airplane. Batman miraculously recovers after barely being able to walk because his body is so worn out from crime fighting. The story line actually would have been better if it stayed with the storyline of the comic book it was based on. The Batman would have been older but still strong, with the kind of aches that come with the territory of aging. Instead we get Christian Bale, slumped over, with a goatee, as a virtual cripple. The bad guy was completely boring and unintelligible until the end of the film, which is where all the bombs are finally dropped. This was probably two movies crushed into one movie and it made the storyline run full tilt and all over the map trying to tie it all together. I think the very end was the best part of movie because you know there's going to be a second chance to do better than this film.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I play this app just about everyday. I dislike the ads, just like everyone else... But I understand that is what makes the app free, so I whine very little about it. I can either play this with ads or with a deck of cards and have to shuffle and stuff... Which is using my hands in old fashioned ways in which human hands should nevermore be used.
B008133DO8|5.0|What an amazing and well written update to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman take Sherlock and Watson to modern levels that still fit the brilliance of the detective Sherlock Holmes. As with anything the British create for television, this series will probably not last much longer. I think it would be very difficult to maintain the intensity of this Sherlock Holmes, who needs so much stimulation to keep his mind working. Martin Freeman as Dr. Watson has been updated perfectly in a way that only people of today can understand. Watching their interaction, along with a great supporting cast of characters, makes Sherlock one of the best television shows created in some time.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|The book keeps you interested and most situations of plantation life are likely to have occurred. But the plantation family seemed too dysfunctional on so many levels it detracted a lot from the story. Main characters were not believable.
B00499K9E0|5.0|What a fantastic update to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's detective Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock is a modern man in a world filled with crime that is just not very intriguing to him. He solves most crimes in under a minute because he sees the painfully obvious (to him) details. He refuses to take cases because they are boring and can be solved by the police. His interest is only piqued, when there are unusual aspects to the crime. He makes Scotland Yard look and feel incompetent and the love/hate relationship goes deep in the police force. Sherlock, however, solves the crimes through deduction, pondering and having those \\"ahha\\" moments when it suddenly all makes sense. Dr. Watson is a retired soldier/doctor with PTSD coming out of his ears. Watson hates civilian life and has not much reason to live. Watson meets Sherlock and they are a perfectly mismatched pair of room mates, with a penchant for wanting to go where the action is. I realize that this update to Sherlock is not going to please people who love the books but the story lines are modern, tense and worth watching more than once.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|We received the new \\"Titanic\\" DVD in good time.  Within a few days, we played it.  The sound and video were superb, as good as when we saw it in the theater the first time.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who likes \\"Titanic\\".
1439192812|5.0|I said that I was buying this book for my kids, but to be honest, I bought it for myself. I'm an amateur when it comes to science, and this book provides such an amazingly eloquent, easily-accessible introduction to some of the most important scientific topics of the day. Even so, each chapter contains an amazing wealth of information. In short, my mind was blown with each turn of the page. Thank you, Mr. Dawkins. And I highly recommend this book to anyone. Absolutely anyone.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|While some of the edge might have gone from their earlier years this concert series is evidence of their abilities as musicians and having left on-stage battles behind them.<br /><br />A must have set for any fan of Cream or Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce & Ginger Baker as individuals.

I guess I'll call Fox customer support as exchanging the disk with the store doesn't guarantee I'll get a functional version. real bummer.<br />======================<br /><br />update: many thanks to those that responded to my crashing problems, I found the issue was with the cyberlink powerdvd 12 software, after updating it i was able to view this movie CRASH FREE.

B000PKX2KA|3.0|Originally I had read the on-line description as if this were a DeLorme product since it was shown in the same picture as the DeLorme Street Atlas.  It's not!  I found the instructions for setting it up very confusing.  It definately is not \\"plug and play\\".<br /><br />I finally called the manufacturer and he walked me thru the process - which had not worked when I had originally tried it.<br /><br />The GPS now work just fine.
B002VPE1WK|2.0|I bought this bag to carry my gear on a week-long trip. I had grown out of my small shoulder bag and this looked perfect for what I was planning to carry. In fact, it was perfect. I got my DSLR and 3 lenses, a couple of small HD video cameras, some audio gear, and all the batteries, cards, and filters I have in the bag; It all easily fit with no need to cram anything in. I was even able to strap a tripod on the side. Everything seemed to have a place and when I left I was really pleased with the bag.<br /><br />I spent the week shooting and the bag did the job, but it was starting to come apart by the end of the week. By the time I got back home, I was really unhappy with the condition the bag was in, in spite of the way I babied it once I noticed the straps were pulling apart. Needless to say, I returned the bag to Amazon, who happily refunded me. The moral of the story is, if you don't have much gear (i.e., half what Amazon says this bag will carry) this bag will serve you well. Otherwise, look for something else.<br /><br />Rather than getting a replacement, I took the money and bought a more expensive bag that better met my needs and has lasted me many trips--the [[ASIN:B000EXM060 Lowepro Stealth Reporter D550 AW Camera Bag]]. It is a massive shoulder bag that is built like a tank. If you'd rather have a backpack, I'm sure one of the Lowepros would serve you well.
1608871088|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3V0DGBI8TVC33]]When I first saw the cover, I found it puzzling that an animated movie artbook would have a cover with this much white space. Covers for such books are usually filled with strong colours.<br /><br />Featured in this 156-page hardcover are gorgeous concept art for the DreamWorks animated film. Rise of the Guardians is based on the children book series The Guardians of Childhood, written by William Joyce, who's also the film's executive producer.<br /><br />Just printed behind the covers are huge detailed 3D portraits of the six main characters. They are North, Bunny, Tooth, Sandy, Jack Frost and Pitch. The art revolve around them.<br /><br />Animated films with mythical characters are pretty common but it's always fun to see different interpretation. The character designs are wonderful. All the six are given a slight twist. North, aka Santa Claus, wields two swords and looks more like a warrior. And Bunny looks quite cool with the serious demeanor. My favourites are probably the designs for Sandy and Tooth. There's also much to read with the lengthy commentary on the characters.<br /><br />Beside character art, there are many beautiful paintings of the magical worlds they live in. Some of the ones I like are from Max Boas, Tim Lamb, Jayee Borcar, Peter Maynez, Felix Yoon, Patrick Hanenberger and Woonyoung Jung. They create much of the environment art of which many are printed big and nice.<br /><br />Overall, the artbook packs plenty of things to see and read. It's fantastic and highly recommended.<br /><br />It seems there are two publishers for this book, Titan Books and Insight Editions. Prices for the books might differ depending on where the books are sold.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B005NPBT5M|5.0|Ever since it's original release in 1979, I have owned this on vinyl, cassette and CD. Roger Waters, David Gilmore, Richard Wright and Nick Mason are arguably some of the most gifted on talented musicians, writers and entertainers of all time (RIP Richard Wright). As I listen to this CD, I am reminded of growing up and coming of age when this was THE album to listen to. I could pick apart this CD song by song but I believe nearly everyone who has it can come up with a different meaning and perspective of what it says. To name a specific song as a favorite from \\"The Wall\\" is nearly impossible as each relates to the others. This album tells a story and I believe that story is depicted in everyone's life at one point or another. If not, then you are a very unique soul.<br />A 5 star rating cannot do it justice as The Wall is in a class all by itself, along with Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here or any other Pink Floyd album. Each tells a story and each is unique to itself. Do not just listen to this but rather study it, absorb it and let it consume you. A set of good head phones will bring it even closer. You will definitely become, \\"Comfortably numb.\\"
B006GHA9VQ|4.0|I was never a big fan of the original Phantom. But I enjoyed this .... much more.<br /> I shouldn't have . It's more what \\"2010\\" was to \\"2001\\" .... prose vs poetry.<br /><br />  And yet, I could not have been more engaged in the way it attempted to answer<br />  many questions left over from the original. It's more soap opera than epic, more<br />  involving than dazzling. It's like the 2nd half of \\"Gone With the Wind\\" where<br />  every unpaid bill comes due in a hell-to-pay whirlwind. You can't help but watch.<br /><br />  There's one overlong scene in the beginning when the Phantom appears at<br />  Christine's window. Yawn. But sit though it because things get better. Much better.
B00932A2MC|3.0|The special effects/action were great but the movie was a little long in the tooth and there wasn't much substance to the movie. I would have loved more action and less of the boring stuff

0399157565|5.0|I could not believe this was the 20th Dr. Kay Scarpetta novel. I have throughly enjoyed throughout the years reading about the characters and watching them evolve into intriguing, dynamic, and mesmerizing individuals. I have always found forensic science fascinating! Patricia Cornwell does an outstanding job writing about interesting procedures, equipment and pathology. She did not disappoint me at all in The Bond Bed. In fact I was hooked while reading the prologue!<br />As someone who's not technology inclined I'm always impressed with all that goes on  in a Scarpetta novel, especially when Lucy is involved. A tidbit of trivia offered about Lucy was that she wears a grapefruit scented cologne. What's up with that?! As the story develops the characters are unfolding in ways that shocked me. The manner in which Dr. Scarpetta was berated by the judge, the District Attorney and Special Agent Douglas Burke was nerve wrenching. I became so enthralled in the story, I could feel my anger raging at time for how they were treating Kay!<br />As the time moved on I wasn't sure what path in life Benson was taking. Lucy as always has mystery surrounding her, but I was thrilled by the way her life had changed. I only wish she had more of a role in this novel.<br />As for the murders that had to be solved. It is always amaze me that the author can take that one thread of evidence and manipulate it into a intriguing and suspenseful story line. Again, Patricia Cornwell did an exceptional job in connecting all the loose ends at the end for the readers.<br />Sadly, now I have to wait perhaps another year to read about Dr. Kay Scarpetta and all who are in her closet circle.

B001DJ7PR8|5.0|A film by Woody Allen filmed in Barcelona. An intricate interwoven story involving the personal lives of 7 people in search of their selves, happiness, their cultures, and their love life.

B005QUQP76|5.0|This is the most comfortable, solid, high quality, best looking, mouse I have ever owned or used. It doesn't feel plasticy, it has good weight (which can be adjusted) and the pads slide well. I'm not a super hardcore gamer, so i can't speak too much to the performace or accuracy, but it's more than capable for my needs. The sniper button is handy for lowering sensitivity drastically on the fly. The blue LED is a nice touch, and it's subtle enough that it's not distracting.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This was a very eye opening story.  However, there was alot of information noted in here that shouldn't have been shared with the public.  The men and woman of the US Armed Forces sacrifice alot for us to have the freedoms we do.  But it comes at a price to the Service Members.  The story was well told.  I am extremely greatful for what the Seal Team did by getting Bin Laden.  This book is a GREAT read.
1453830987|5.0|My husband bought this book for me just because he thought it looked like something I would enjoy.  Well, let's just say that P.G. Wodehouse is now on my top 5 favorite authors list!  Wodehouse's writing is extremely entertaining - very \\"intellectual\\" but not so much that I struggle to figure out what he's saying.  Witty is probably a better word.  Very, very British in a wonderful way.  His word pictures are so delightful that I find myself laughing out loud often and giggling most of the time.  The Jeeves series is outrageously funny, and the BBC TV series starring Hugh Laurie (House) is a wonderful follow-up to the books.  After reading this one, my hubby ordered me another \\"Jeeves\\" book, and then I stumbled upon a compilation of 5 of Wodehouse's stories (2 Jeeves, 3 others) in one book at a thrift shop.  Still enjoying that one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is easy to get addicted to this game. The only negative I can give is the ad that pops up every time you start a new game. Easily deleted but still frustrating.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|wow i was looking for media player to certain which no othrr player was able to play and given a try this app. after install it nicely arranged all my media , music and photo. the video needed some additional software and it automaticqlly found it and asked my permisssion and when i clicked yes it installed it and here it go my video is playing smoothly.. love u aVia player you made my day.. thanks alot
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Love TWD!  I laughed when I bought this wondering if the screwdriver is a key of some sort and how \\"fun\\" that would be.  The screwdriver does release a mechanism to allow the head to tilt back, although you could force it open without the driver in place.<br /><br />The show and the extras are worth the money, the \\"case\\" was just a bonus.  Though we won't have it out all the time due to nieces, visiting children, it does come out for parties.  It serves as a great conversation piece.
B000FC1JAI|4.0|Marcus Aurelius' musings are delightful! I thoroughly enjoyed this, and found it uplifting and inspiring. You don't have to be familiar with Greek/Roman principles to understand it, either. Aurelius eulogizes the virtues of restraining our emotions and sacrificing for the greater good. He believed that it is not the situations we are in that are the problem, our attitude and how we react to them is. Definitely makes you think. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B007ORVC36|5.0|This series is the best I've seen in a long time...brilliant accurate colors of the time and the costuming as well...such a blast from the past and SUPER sexy!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Keeping it simple and sweet. Large easy to read display.  Tracks calculations for easy corrections. Could not be happier with this app!
B000MX7V5M|4.0|This film has the royalty of Hollywood in it.  Cary Grant(did he ever appear in a bad movie?), Grace Kelly at her most beautiful, and Alfred Hitchcock(ok, he appears for a few seconds and he is not beautiful) appear in one of the most famous films in history.  To say you eill like this movie is an underststement-you will love it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|well u know it workz! what more do u want. its def. an upgrade from the last facebook app that just sent u to the browser
B000EHSVS2|5.0|George C. Scott gives a towering performance as George Patton.  It is an immensely popular film that idealizes the man who many consider the best American general oF World War II.  Has any American not seen, and enjoyed, this movie?
B005WUHAX8|2.0|This was a total waste of money. It was ultra thin which was a plus but I had to order a new case within two weeks of buying it! They say this case is water proof but its obviously sound proof as well because everyone on the other side of my calls couldn't hear a thing. I had to practically tell for them to hear me! On top of that all of my flash pictures turned out pink because it reflected off of the phone. Maybe my case was just a defect but I would reccomend buying a much cheaper case because it works better than this one.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|It is a pretty simple game with a nice aesthetic. Though I would not specifically go on and on about it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|its a fun match three type game with a little extra fun. I'm hoping I don't finish it too quick though. Great graphics and amusing story.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I like hidden object games but this is a good game. I have enjoyed it so far.<br />would like to try more games like this one. and I would try them.<br />it loaded on my kindle fire really good too.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|The item was shipped to me quickly and in good condition. The CD works very well and met the description given. I was very satisfied with this order.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The game lasted a long while. Good problem solving. Lots of fun for my kid and me.<br />A little too intense for him at times but then he is four years old.<br /><br />.
B008SVS3FC|5.0|I used to miss some of the fire of Mr. Hiatt's earlier works while listening to his more recent efforts. The older stuff was great for road trips. This new one is going into the car for my next road trip.  I have to hand it to him. The guitar work and the lyrics on this latest CD are very compelling. \\"One of Them Damn Days\\" and It \\"All Comes Back Someday\\" brings me back to his earlier works. He is a great story teller, and \\"We're Alright Now shows he has not lost his touch. Every song is a winner. The collection of music is very well paced, and fans of Mr. Hiatt will love the music. Finding an old friend doing new songs is well worth the purchase.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love pinterest but using it on kindle is annoying. You can't pin things by just surfing web. You have to repin existing pins. Way easier on a desk top. If they fixed this issue I would give it 5 stars
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Lee Child continues to shine, title after exciting title. The plot, the suspense and the ever present twists and turns, make each succeeding Reacher novel a compelling page turner. A Wanted Man is no less than 'Brilliant'.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Really enjoy playing on my Kindle Fire HD. Lots of levels and arrangements. However, game sometimes freezes or won't allow you to highlight available tiles. I do like that you can scramble tiles without limit.
0316228532|5.0|I don't know why everyone is comparing this to Harry Potter. It is not Harry Potter. It's a new book. I believe it would have received better reviews if it was an unknown author. I thought it was a \\"great read.\\"
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is rad. I really really like some of the games. unlocking new ones is addicting. you will easily get addicted too. this is the best game.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|I first saw Kiss in concert, right after the 1st album was released,,became a fan. As all bands they went thru the usual sound alike albums for a while. Sonic Boom was a return to their roots rock and roll. This album is better than the last one. It gets better and better the longer I listen to it. If U like Kiss U'll love this album.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|This is my second Invicta Pro Diver watch. The first lasted 4-5 years and got lost swimming in a slide rock channel. My wrist hit the rock when I slipped and fell and the clasp or one of the pins must have let go. It slid down the rock into the water but I could not find it in the shifting sand.<br /><br />I'm in construction and abused that watch in every way possible. I'd replaced the crystal twice and the bezel once. The crystal sticks out at three o'clock (magnification to see the date) and that is the first point of impact when brushing up against anything. Same issue with the blue bezel, the blue wore off. I was getting ready to replace it again when the watch left me. I use the bezel as a timer daily.<br /><br />Anyway, loved the old watch, kept great time, everyone thought it very nice. \\"Watch People\\" who care about what they are wearing thought it was a nice watch, and were always curious how much it cost. As it was a gift I had no idea but the price I paid here makes it a deal.<br /><br />It is very heavy and the body is somewhat large. It took me awhile to get used to the size (which is smaller than a lot of Invicta's I've seen) and my wrists are not small.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I rented this and it was a great action movie, loved the charaters and plot.  Kept me entertained throughout the whole movie.  Rent this or buy as you will watch it again.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I used this on my kindle fire no problem. However, on the HD it will not send mail. I am seriously rethinking if I want to keep the Hd or not.
B009G78EE2|5.0|There is no other sound like Macklemore. He's in a class of rappers (really only him and Lupe Fiasco) that are so far ahead and so far beyond the current status quo and topics that it will take at least a decade to catch up. Each single reflects years of work and days of just sitting with a pen and paper.<br /><br />I don't need to review each song because each one is gold.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I loved it two years ago for my iPod and I was so happy to see it available now for my Kindle. I tried the impostor but it was terrible and with the original being here with cool new updates like the puzzle and the option to shake the board, awsome! Thanks GameCorcus.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Sound was tingy and I couldn't work the mute switch on the side.  I do know people with these that love them but mine did not work.
B008XG1X18|4.0|this app is good. it allows me enjoy all that pinterest has to offer from my kindle fire. however, occasionally the app is glitchy and doesn't load the first time or will crash. it usually works fine after a second go.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|LOVE IT! its just so addicting and fun! amazing how entertaing this is. i could play this game for hours if i could.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|It was really great to continue reading this story.  The only problem was waiting so long to delve back into these characters' lives.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Do you want my 5 Star rating? Don't make me write all these words.  Damn!! Five more words and I can submit this.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|I can't believe these A-list stars did this stupid musical. Yes, it's a musical about the 80's. They've taken the songs we loved from the greatest decade, and perverted them into a musical. I couldn't finish watching this would be movie. How do you take something so fun and ruin it? Just ignore this review and find out for yourself. I loved the 80's and all of the hair bands from this era. It's not the bands singing. It's the actors! A C T O R S!!!Not singers, that sing here. Be warned, the positive reviews here had to have been paid. There's just no other explaination...
0399157565|5.0|WOW! Patricia Cornwell is at the top of her game in \\"The Bone Bed\\". I have to admit that I was one of the readers who was secretly delighted for Cornwell to return to the first person point of view, and this book really treats us to the Kay we all know and adore. Ranging in settings from the Canadian wilderness to the waters of the Charles River in Boston, the plot is expertly crafted and fast paced. I was shocked by many of the twists in the story and a bit surprised by some unexpected flirting (that was something!) with someone from the past--all of it written beautifully. The only cautionary note I would issue is that if you're expecting to pick this up and read a chapter or two at a time, FORGET IT! Cornwell has a way of pulling the reader in and not letting go until the very end--Brava Ms. Cornwell!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!!  I wish there were more books by this author.  I have recommended it to everyone I know that likes to read.  Not one has been disappointed:-)
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Donald Fagen has done it again!! \\"Sunken Condos\\" is another instant classic.  As usual, it is replete with the same level of superlative musicianship, lyricism, intelligence, class and style that's come to characterize his work.  There is a familiarity that, in part, stems from allusions to the older classics in his catalog.  DF musically refers to I.G.Y. and Ruby Baby ([[ASIN:B001OB7R7S The Nightfly]]); King of The World ([[ASIN:B000V6AD0K Countdown To Ecstasy]]); Pretzel Logic ([[ASIN:B000V6ACUG Pretzel Logic]]); Your Gold Teeth II ([[ASIN:B000V6ACL0 Katy Lied]]); The Night Belongs To Mona ([[ASIN:B00122BETG Morph The Cat]]); Deacon Blues ([[ASIN:B00003002C Aja]]); Trans-Island Skyway ([[ASIN:B001PJ5UIM Kamakiriad]]), Hey 19 ([[ASIN:B000V697WK Gaucho]]), etc. throughout 'Condos.'  This usage is rife with irony. DF's approach to newness was, in part, to use something old--something he's never done before. If it's true that creativity stops around age 50, no one told Donald, for the invention and experimentation in Condos makes that assertion ludicrous.  His brilliant remake of Isaac Hayes' \\"Out of the Ghetto\\" alone negates the contention that he broke no new ground on this record.  He also employed Upright Bass, Vibraphone and solo Violin, instruments he's rarely if ever used before, but that's not the only reason it sounds so fresh.  There is an underlying sense of fun and joy in these songs.  Only an artist of Donald's caliber and mindset can make a narrative about a bowler's untimely death (Miss Marlene) sound mellifluous.  Condos is the work of an artist who is comfortable with life and himself.  There is a brightness that shines through the track with even the darkest theme.  Humor has always played a prominent role in SD/DF/WB oeuvre, but these songs are laugh-out-loud funny. (\\"Four old hippies/Drivin' in the rain/I asked for a lift--they said/Get used to the pain.\\"--Weather In My Head)  There is such heart, honesty, humor, self-awareness and warmth in these tracks that it's almost palpable. Like all Fagen/Becker compositions, Condos will take hold of your soul and won't let go. Rather than regale you with my personal opinions on each track, I'll say this:  I have listened to it on a continuous loop for a week now and I just can't get over it.  This will live in my ipod for the next 9 months at least.<br /><br />Before Sunken Condos, Michael Leonhart and the Avramina 7's [[ASIN:B003A05TQC Seahorse And The Storyteller]] lived on a constant loop in my playlist (It comes highly recommended, as well).  A big congrats goes out to the multi-talented Leonhart who co-produced with Fagen and played drums on every track.  He also contributed a plethora of other instrumentation throughout the album (guitar, keys, clavinet, vibes, trumpet, voice, etc.)  Donald was looking for a laid-back feel that was reminiscent of drummers from the '30s and '40s and Michael was an audacious choice who delivered.  As a long-time Leonhart fan as well, I'm glad to see him get his well-deserved turn in the spotlight.  I predict he will become a highly in-demand producer following this stellar effort.  I also predict Sunken Condos will garner lots of acclaim and award nominations come 2013-14. (I'd love to see DF inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a soloist) Well, I'm off to take another dose of Vitamin D(F). I don't know what pill Don has been taking, but the entire music industry needs a hefty dose, stat!tracks that it's almost palpable.

B004GYY714|5.0|A wonderful way to listen to anything at anytime from anywhere. This is a must have for any news/radio junkie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun adicting game that's simple yet fun and easy to figure out not always so easy to pass the levels.
B005LAJ1H2|4.0|I felt that the 2nd season of Boardwalk Empire lived up to all my expectations after having scene all of season 1 & I'm very glad that I purchased it.
0061537969|5.0|I recommend the book to everyone. The dog is telling the story... I'm pretty sure he has a human brain, a great sense of humor and wit, that is for sure. Enjoy!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|This is a gripping story from start to end. It is a brilliant book, that I highly recommend reading. I couldn't put it down.
B000002WU8|3.0|Classic album, it's all there on the 2 LPs provided, but it didn't come with the original artwork - just a black LP sleeve.  Doesn't denegrate the music in anyway and the production pops, RZA's drums detonate throughout.  An annoyance as a big fan and vinyl collector to not have the artwork you envisioned, though.
B007U1FEJE|3.0|The band is tops. The harmonies perfect. The lyrics predictable. I love the Beach Boys but it is adult contemporaty music with a surf motif.
B008LZHA3G|3.0|great anticipation for this album, very disappointed.  Sound quality was poor to say the least, excepting possibly two songs the rest were without meaning. the worst in years cannot compare to last two or three albums. his days I am afraid are numbered as it relates to good fresh material.
B001DUGOWY|4.0|Even though I don't think this is Steinbeck's best book, it is definitely thought-provoking. I found Steinbeck's observations of the American life in 1960 dramatic, yet the problems described are not very different from today's. The main character, Ethan Allen Hawley is a very difficult who lives in an anguished status in this contemporary world. He is deeply committed to his ancestral inheritance and his wife and children,he values honesty and morality, yet betrays his best friend to achieve what some of the important town folks have achieved, status and money. Ethan's change from observer to player energizes him, but in the end it is his son's fraud that breaks Ethan.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|started out pretty cool. then came the pieces with no way to move them. there you set unless you want to start all over.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I guess I am just bored with the poor writing and the back and forth between the characters.  I want to say: \\"Oh come on already!\\"
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book will change the way you look at your life and the people in it.  I realized a lot about myself while reading it.  Everyone should read it.
B008BOWGPE|4.0|Wonderful DVD a must for any Tarja fan it kicks the ass of all other DVDs  buy it you won't be sorry ;)
B007TK77QE|5.0|I have to admit, I was a little apprehensive about reading this book as even as an adult i just loved the Harry Potter books. However from the first opening lines i had put aside my reservations and immersed myself into this book. I thought it was a fast paced and complex read. I loved the book start to finish and even though I could see what was going to happen it still had my heart in my mouth and a little tear in my eye by the end. There have been mixed reviews about this book, but I would suggest you read it for yourself and give it a try. I loved it
B008G33NFC|5.0|Wonderfull DVD release Tarja is amazing as always this DVD will have a permanent place in my collection forever the music was fabulous the bonus material was awesome I got my DVD from someone who was selling them early I have already watched it 8 times and I'm gonna watch it again this is a must for any Tarja fan :) 5stars buy this you won't be disappointed this is. A must for any Tarja fan :) I'm so glad she finally made a DVD of her band what are you waiting for buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|For SOA fans who were disappointed with how Season 3 dragged on, you will NOT be disappointed by Season 4!  There is so much action...my family and I watched the entire season in 2 days! I am sitting on the edge of my chair waiting for Season 5.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|I love this new CD - I play it so much that I hear the songs in my sleep! My favorite song is Give Me A Reason.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I kept asking the \\"ravers\\" when will the book get better? Most of the book was boring and predictable. Even in a symbiotic relationship, it was  an unrealistic ending.She was a killer who not  apprehended and was not remorseful.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I won't say too much but this was a good movie. It can stand on it's own without being part of a series but being so made this even better than I could have imagined and the effects in this movie are amazing.
B00006I53S|4.0|I got this lens just in time for the NY Comic Con this past weekend. I wanted a mid-range lens with a quiet USM motor, and similar to my girlfriend's L-Series 24-105mm lens. However, since she's the professional photographer, and I'm the amateur with a Canon 20D, I didn't care to spend that much on a lens. So I sprung for this one instead.<br /><br />The Canon EF 28-135mm IS lens is part of Canon's \\"Ultrasonic\\" series. I own one other lens in the line, the EF 100-300mm USM lens. It's great, and hasn't let me down. The 28-135 is no exception. It handled beautifully at the convention.<br /><br />Durability wise, I was packed in with about 4,000 convention goers aimlessly walking around, bumping into me left and right, and subsequently bumping the lens hanging from my neck. Nothing happened though! Shots are crystal clear thanks to the IS function on it.<br /><br />The only qualm I had with it is that the focus is pretty loose, and it's something I also have to deal with on my 100-300mm lens. If you simply point the lens downward, the zoom will extend on it's own. I'm concerned that at some point I might damage the housing around it by bumping it on something. It's more of an annoyance than anything, I guess beggars can't be choosers, but oh well.
B008CP93S0|5.0|My husband and I laughed the whole movie. Highly recommended to watch if you need some laughter in your life.
B0017I3U74|5.0|I love this movie is 1 of my best movies I've ever seen Peggy Sue get good rating from me I love this movie.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|Received product on time. Brand new and shrink-wrapped. Exactly the product I ordered. Came with all 6 of the discs. No scratches. We have already watched the first 3 discs. AMAZING QUALITY!!! Love this series. It is a shame that very few people have watched this series all the way through. More people need to be educated about how living creatures interact with their environments and the impact and responsiblities humans must have. This series does a phenomenal job portraying this. I would give it 10 stars if possible.
B0041KWBQG|5.0|Film stupendo, è arrivato molto rapidamente... Tim Burton è un grande regista e non si smentisce proprio mai, stupendo Depp
1423124111|5.0|Poster Art of the Disney Parks is a gorgeous volume of classic posters and their background stories.  The colors and design, the heavy paper of the pages, and the fascinating background on who created the posters and where they were destined to be posted all contributed to make this oversize book a wonderful addition to my Disney library.  The bonus was a removable poster for display (I will let you be surprised as to which poster that might be!)  If you are a Disney fan who enjoys Disney back stories and beautiful art work, you will love this book!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|awesome....buy it...super fun...really addictive and just a great all around game....I skid not believe this was going to be worth but it totally is.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Got this app as the free app of the day. I love the challenges presented in each round. I'm hooked and will definitely be looking for more playrix games!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is one of the reasons why I love having a tablet. DP has lots of colors and mark types available, it's stable, and the price is absolutely reasonable for what you get. Five stars!
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|If You like Bejeweled, you'll like this. graphics are decent and the addon rules are ok. (provided you like Bejeweled)
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay rounded out the Hunger Games trifecta perfectly.<br />The heroine  Katniss Everdeen lived up to her role that was portrayed in the  1st book down to the letter.<br />I couldn't have written a better ending myself.
B003BWERF8|5.0|Completely satisfied after one day. Having been tied to my Monster Beats earbuds for quite sometime, when using my iPod classic, I needed to get a bluetooth solution going. I already was happy with my Jabra Sport bluetooth earbuds paired to either my iPhone or iPad. I bought the Kokkia i10s (white) because it was cheaper than the black and would look good attached to the silver iPod classic; I was not disappointed. The Jabra earbuds paired flawlessly with the Kokkia attached to the iPod. The Jabra controls run the iPod as long as it is not in locked mode. I still have the limitation of having to recharge the Jabra earbuds every two or three hours, but I can live with that given their performance.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I was fortunate enough to be checking the fatd when this was offered for free. Now I'm addicted! It's a bit pricey but worth the money. Frequent updates with new puzzles. I'd spend the $4.95 now that worked through many of the puzzles, many of them two or more times.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love the ease of pinning if a page has a button, but I wish I could add pins for pages without a pin button.  The app also crashes quite a bit, but it's good enough that I can overlook that.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I find it more challenging than the first Angry birds, also love the new graphics,  keep up the good work and keep more episodes coming
B009B50QOU|3.0|Green Day has proven they can be the masters of the Power Pop genre. This new CD breaks no new ground in that area. The tunes are catchy and typical Green Day pre-American Idiot. I miss the attitude and cohesiveness of American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown. For me a good CD but nothing special
B00866H7SS|5.0|LOVE this book so much! Bared to You is the perfect blend of raunch/romance and real people. I fell in love with the characters and their faults and flaws only made me love them all the more. Cannot wait for the next Crossfire and the one after that and I'm praying for another one after that! Now THIS is bad romance but it's OH so good!
0736092269|5.0|I read reviews and others thought this book was great so I bought it to see for myself. I couldn't belive how unbelievably detailed the illustrations are. This is a great book if you want to see the effect on every muscle as you work out. I actually just bought the stretching book, strength anatomy workout and the core workout just based on this book alone. I know I will not be dissapointed.
B000654YRY|5.0|If you 'like' dire straits you have to own this dvd. Had it years ago as a vhs and discovered it again now .. wow, what a performance - the music is just as strong as ever!
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|The previews made this seem like a riveting addition to the series , even more so than the A vs P movies in the franchise. There are some beautiful images here but the lack of character development really kills this potentially awesome movie. The plot disappoints also. I really wanted to like this movie but uncharacteristically Ridley didn't allow that to happen. Wait for the price to drop and pick it up on sale.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Seems so boring but it is addictive! I didn't realize I would want to spend hours playing it.
B0009XRZ9M|5.0|The Polar Express is such an excellent family movie. My 5 year old daughter watches it every day all year long!
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I'm of a younger generation than, probably, the majority of people who have been listening to Steely Dan, since they are likely dipping into their Medicare pretty hard by now. In fact, I never, ever heard of Donald Fagen until just a few days ago when me and some amigos were shopping at a local CD store and daring each other to buy ultra-cheap albums from unknown-to-us artists from the dollar bin section. As if by chance, I happened to just reach into said bin and pull out the first CD I laid my hands on, and it happened to be Donald Fagen's Sunken Condos! Wow! After taking it home that early morning, I couldn't believe the awesomeness of Donald's very generous, new offering of just nine songs that could have easily fit better on an EP instead of a \\"CD.\\" But still, this EP introduced me to a new artist, for which I'm thankful.<br /><br />I guess a fair comparison to make about Donald and his awesome music is to liken him to the late, great G.G. Allin since both of them appear to be from the same generation of current Medicare dependents. As far as his actual tunes go, I'm surprised that I enjoy Donald's fourth solo album so passionately! For instance, I'm Not the Same Without You seems like a clich&eacute;d love ballad, but when you listen to it very intently as I did, you immediately understand that this is more than just a clich&eacute;d love ballad; it's a clich&eacute;d love ballad that only cost me a dollar and that Carl Douglas would be proud to call his own. I feel like I learned a lot about arrangements and block-rockin' beats just from listening to this song. Weather In My Head is another winner because it is clearly influenced by the groovy sounds of The Captain and Teneel, if The Captain and Teneel took some crystal meth and decided to sell some music on iTunes, that is!<br /><br />Even though I really like Donald now and can't wait for his fifth album when he hits his 70s, I still have to criticize his fourth solo album just a little bit, especially since my many years of life experience have made me an absolute music connoisseur and expert. On songs like The New Breed and Miss Marine, Donald seems to be trying to channel Marylin Manson and Kiss, yet he would be so much better served if he instead channeled Cher and Liberace. Similarly, if Donald would take some cues from The Insane Clown Posse and The Backyard Wrestling Soundtrack, I think that he would easily avoid some of the production problems and slurred singing on tracks like Planet Rhonda and Out Of The Ghetto.<br /><br />Still, for a retiring baby boomer, this is a solid effort, and I give Donald a pat on the back for this stellar effort at making a listenable album. You go, old timer! I hope he doesn't quit the music business and puts out even more inspiring EPs like this one.life experience have made me an absolute music connoisseur and expert.

B00004U28G|5.0|Loved this movie when I was a kid and still love it today but now get to share it with my boys who love it too!
B005LAIHY0|3.0|I really enjoyed the film -- the special effects were beautiful and truly epic and artful.  Though overall the film seemed to miss the mark, for me anyway. It was definitley a thought provoking film about creation but the rest of the story brought nothing new to the genre or franchise. The thing I enjoyed about the first film in the series was the claustiphobic feel and the lonliness of space - I was hoping that would be reflected in this film as well. The acting in this did not feel fresh to me and unfortunatly being a big fan of the first, I enjoyed the improvisation of the acting and how it didn't feel scripted at all - which brought realism and humanity to the first Alien film.  And truth be told I was looking for a few more scares but that is just me.  I would recommend the film a good watch but not the classic chills like \\"Alien\\" or the classic thrills \\"Aliens\\" gave us.
B0086449YA|5.0|This is my favorite of Mark Knopfler's solo albums.Two discs of material and not a song that I feel should have been discarded. His style varies considerably from song to song and yet still fits together as a whole. His usual great guitar work shines on what is, melodically, probably his best album.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|**** 1/2<br /><br />I've probably listened to this album twenty times, and I'm still trying to figure it out. When I first started listening to it, all I wanted to do was immerse myself in the intoxicating sounds. First and foremost, that ethereal, old-soul soprano. Second, the lush, shimmering production: The sweeping, orchestral touches, the more subdued acoustic moments, and the experimental and occasionally even spastic electronica that comes and goes throughout the album.<br /><br />But then after listening to many of the tracks over and over again, I finally started listening more closely to the words that Ellie is singing. And I discovered that so many of them were sad tales about broken relationships. \\"Anything Could Happen\\" sounds at first like a techno gospel song, with her vocals so soaring and powerful at its peak, when she sings \\"I know it's gonna be\\" eight times in a row, each time sounding like she's reaching harder for the divine. But then you realize what follows, when she sings \\"but I don't think I need you.\\" These surprise lyrics change the tone of the song entirely.<br /><br />Something similar happens on the next track, \\"Only You,\\" a throbbing, electronic blues song. The song at first listen seems to suggest lust and longing, until you pay closer attention to the lyrics. \\"Only you could see/the emptiness I feel/when you're with me.\\" The title track, \\"Halcyon,\\" immediately wears it's melancholy on its sleeve. \\"When it's just us/You show me what it feels like to be lonely\\" she sings soberly. And when she claims \\"It's going to be better\\" it's clear she means when the relationship is over.<br /><br />As much as the juxtaposition of Ellie's folky voice and songwriting with cutting-edge electronica drives much of the album, tracks like \\"JOY\\" and \\"I Know You Care\\" prove that her music can be just as compelling without bells and whistles. And they also make it impossible to ignore the broken heart that was clearly the creative inspiration for this album.<br /><br />So, after twenty listens, I'm still not entirely sure what to make of \\"Halcyon\\". Is it a groundbreaking pop album? Is it a glorious, shimmering break-up record? I'm still not sure. But there's no doubt about this young woman's talent. \\"Halcyon\\" shows impressive growth from \\"Lights\\" (which I already really liked). Ellie Goulding is the real deal..<br /><br />So, after twenty listens, I'm still not entirely sure what to make of \\"Halcyon\\". Is it a groundbreaking pop album?

B009IEXKXI|2.0|Yes, this is an OK book for techno-geeks.  It's inventive, moderately credible,and holds the interest.  I don't down-grade it because I'm not a geek, but rather because its inventiveness is often contrived, a lazy author trying to fix a faulty narrative.  And yes, because of the profanity (including the useless, boring F-bomb), which is about as attractive as any other pre-adolescent \\"cussing.\\"
0425263908|4.0|Great book. Great love scenes! It is similiar to 50 Shades of Grey but 50 Shades by far is still the best. I did get a little bored in this story but still want to read the next one!!!

B0085Z3B2Q|4.0|I thought was very informative, as well as educational for all ages.  What I also liked was the three shorts, especially the one with the bears.  I recommend purchasing the movie, and if you have a 3D monitor, get the other combo, the colors were great on my Pionner.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I was very pleased at the design of this unit. It is very compact, but has many features. First, let me do a minor rant as to why I needed to buy this converter. It boggles my mind that there isn't even a headphone jack on many TVs these days. No audio output whatsoever other than optical. Pay $500-1500 for a nice flat screen and you get optical output, but they can't include a 25 cent headphone jack? Sheesh. For under $29 delivered to my door, I was able to connect this nice little converter to my LG plasma and have excellent sound through an outboard amplifier and some real speakers. I happened to have a spare optical cable from something I bought several years ago, so that part was easy. The LG has a couple of USB ports, so I used one of those to power this converter.  When I connected power and the fiber optic cable, the converter LED lit up bright blue and said \\"locked\\". I used the RCA connector output and connected my amplifier...the sound is great. The converter also has an 1/8\\" output jack, so it would work with computer speakers or headphones, too. There is a wired digital input which I did not try. The converter comes with a USB cable and an external USB-type power supply, in case you don't have a USB jack available for power like I did. All-in-all, I was impressed by the look and feel of this thing, nicely packaged and just works nicely.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|This is an amazing album; the first since Evanescence, where a female rocker has taken her voice to a whole new level!
