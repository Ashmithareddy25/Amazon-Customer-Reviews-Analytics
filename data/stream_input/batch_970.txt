B002YIHO7I|3.0|One of my favorite artist ever and so I expect alot. If this wasnt Sade, I would rate this album 2 stars. A couple quality songs, however, whats up with the drum machine? In addition, way too many harmonies. Her voice is still too good to have someone else tainting it in the background. Gone are the days that you grab your chick, put her new album in, and simply press play. This album would be acceptable if the 10 year absence was only a 2 year one.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|Funny situations, thoughtful acting by very good actors like Sigourney Weaver, Tim Allen and Tony Shalhoub, realistic spaceships and special effects combine create a near perfect Sci-Fi Comedy.  The underlying story about people who don't really know what they're doing, but who get by \\"acting like they do\\" makes this movie satisfying for a more \\"serious minded\\" adult audience too.
1592402690|5.0|Not for the casual fan, this book delves into how the records were made, layer by layer.  You also get a flavor of the moods of the Beatles during this time as well as insight into the creative process.  I marked up several pages and passages because they made me want to go back and listen to the vinyl recordings to see if I could pick up on some of the subtleties he talked about.      After reading this book I think you might agree the Beatles were the most creative, prolific band of all time... it really hits you in the face when you consider the limitations of the technology, the sheer number of songs...the melodies.  Emerick was one lucky guy for sure... Beatles 4 ever!

B00006L7XQ|5.0|My first experience with the music from this album was watching the video to Johnny's cover or Nine Inch Nail's \\"Hurt.\\" The imagery was so intense and seeing Johnny aged made me feel emotions I had never felt from music before. I got the album based on that one listen and I did not regret it. The album's filled with music that was made in such an honest way, it's hard to believe considering how much music is over-produced these days. Rick Rubin needs to be commended for his production on this album. He did not take away the takes where Johnny's voice falters in the album. Thank God he did because it depicts a man at the end of his road. It's honest music filled with emotion from a legend. I truly believe his American Recordings series is the best work he ever did. Buy this album now.
B001AQT11M|5.0|When you look at this movie with the 20/20 benefit of 80 or so years of hindsight, you see that Disney and his people were actually setting up the parameters for a whole new kind of film, and establishing certain givens that would endure through most of their classic animated features: a beautiful young heroine (who isn't *entirely* helpless), animals both friendly and sinister, thrills, scary bits, humor, magic, music, and romance.  They also expand upon the original (in this case a story from Grimms' fairy tales) to make the story more compehensible and the characters people we can better relate to.  Snow White (voiced by Adriana Caselotti, the 21-year-old daughter of an operatic family) is a young princess forced by her vain stepmother the Queen (Lucille La Verne) to dress in rags and work as a scullery maid (presumably her father is dead, though we're never definitely told, and the Queen simply seized the throne as Regent and hung onto it).  When the Queen's Magic Mirror informs her that Snow White can now be reckoned \\"fairest of them all,\\" she plots to have the girl murdered, but her huntsman (Stuart Buchanan) can't go through with the deed and urges her to run away and hide in the forest.  With the help of the small animals she befriends, she finds the house of the Seven Dwarfs, wins their hearts, and is then found and pursued by the Queen in the guise of a \\"harmless old beggar woman,\\" with poison apple at hand.    In today's liberated climate, some viewers may censure Snow for her panicked flight into the deep woods, but it's worth asking yourself if *you* wouldn't panic too if someone had just come after you with a Bowie knife!  And although Snow dreams of the day \\"my prince will come\\" and take her away, she's still a hard, uncomplaining worker who cheerfully resigns herself to the Queen's tyrannies and makes the most of her situation--which, of course, enables her to make a place for herself in the Dwarves' home.  But the best parts of the movie aren't evenabout her: they focus on things like the friendly animals (watch for the raccoons helping to do the Dwarves' laundry, or the buck who helps pull an ore-cart at their diamond mine), the magic, and the music (anyone who doesn't want to get up and dance during the Dwarves' Yodel Song is seriously in need of an attitude adjustment!).  And, of course, the Dwarves themselves, each a distinct individual (I suspect that a great many of us like Grumpy the best!).  This is a DVD that no family library should lack.

B001F7MSFW|4.0|4.5 out of 5<br /><br />Long ago a war was fought between mythical creatures and humanity and, during that war, King Balor, leader of an elfin race, had an unstoppable Golden Army created for him, one that laid waste to humanity. The army marched and destroyed everything in its path. Amidst the piles of bodies and oceans of blood, the king felt great regret so a truce was made between mythical creatures and humankind. The agreement: the mythical creatures stuck to living in the forests whereas humanity could have the land. As well, the special crown that King Balor (or anyone of royal blood) used to control the Golden Army was split into three parts, which two were kept for himself, the third to humans. Also, the Golden Army was hidden somewhere on Earth in dormancy, locked away.<br /><br />King Balor's son, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), didn't like the agreement so exiled himself and waited for the right time to strike and take control of the Army and remove the humans from the planet.<br /><br />Enter present day, where business flows as usual for Hellboy (Ron Pearlman) and the rest of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (B.P.R.D.). That is, until, Nauda resurfaces and begins slaughtering humans as he tries to piece the crown together so he can control the Golden Army again and find out the secret location as to where the Army is hidden.<br /><br />To add to the B.P.R.D.'s distress, Hellboy and Liz (Selma Blair) are having issues. She wants him more domesticated; he wants to remain free-spirited. Also, Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) is taken with Nuada's twin sister, Princess Nuala (Anna Walton) and, unfortunately, she is linked to Nuada so everything that happens to him happens to her as well. Nuala wants to stop her brother for what he has planned.<br /><br />The B.P.R.D. seems to have met its match, especially when things turn south and the Golden Army rises once more.<br /><br />I was super late seeing this movie. In fact, I just saw it prior to this review. It wasn't for a lack of trying either, but life happens and other movies come out and, well, the next thing you know it's almost two years later and you're finally playing catch up. Let me just say it was worth the wait. I was a fan of the first Hellboy and though this one carries with it the same undertone as the first, the overall feeling of it is different: the first one was more monster oriented and this one was more fantasy oriented. I felt at times like I was watching a cross between Lord of the Rings and Van Helsing.<br /><br />Ron Perlman as Hellboy was pure awesome. I love the down-to-earth nature of the character plus the fact that despite him being a kind of rock `n' roll tough guy, he's really just a big kid underneath all that red.<br /><br />Selma Blair was feisty and dark as always, and she and Perlman had excellent chemistry in their Liz/Hellboy relationship.<br /><br />It was cool, too, to see Abe Sapien get more of the emotional spotlight this flick with him falling in love with Princess Nuala. At first I thought the dude was all about books and that was it. Looks like there's a tender heart underneath those gills after all.<br /><br />The layered storytelling was great, and there was a sense of history to the Army, the elfin race, and things on Hellboy's side of the fence. It wasn't just some standard good-guys-versus-bad-guys stuff. Cool beans.<br /><br />The action was superb, hardcore and fun. The epic scale for some of the battles rocked, especially when Hellboy goes up against the big green guy that grows trees. Cool fight and Hellboy's big hero moment/pose on top of the hotel sign hanging onto that baby was comical yet cool as well.<br /><br />Was this as good as the first? Hard to say. Tied for sure, though the first one is still my favorite.<br /><br />This sucker's worth 4 and a half cigars in my book, though.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />A.P.

0684833395|1.0|I know people will downvote me like crazy for this review, so shame on me for being honest, I guess.<br /><br />I was disappointed with this book. I had borrowed it from the library recently and tried sitting through it. I mainly borrowed it because of all the praise it got and the amount of hype surrounding it. I do enjoy a little \\"brain popcorn\\" now and then, so I'd enjoy it.<br /><br />I didn't.<br /><br />First off, the writing here is garbage. Actually, it's every bit as bad as Twilight. The worst crime with the writing is that, like the aforementioned Twilight saga, Heller does more telling than showing. Yeah, the gun is across the room. you don't need to tell us that. How about \\"Clevinger was surprised to discover the inexorable hatred of the Action board, which was the strangest of many things happening\\". That is way better than, paraphrasing here, \\"There were many strange things happening. The strangest of all was the inexorable hatred of the Action Board. Clevinger was surprised to discover it.\\" There are more examples of that throughout the book, and they are WAY longer than the one I provided. There are several run-on sentences and examples of bad grammar, which are annoying. And the dialogue is just \\"shoot me in the head\\" awful. Further, he abuses such tags as \\"He lied\\" or \\"He questioned\\", which gets repetitive.<br /><br />The plot? Was there even any plot? I could hardly distinguish one. Just random events happening. Also, the book tries to make itself like a movie by jumping around from character to character when it comes to certain things, something I hate. The names are stupid too- Major Major Major Major? Colonel Korn? I get that this book is meant to be a satire, but those names are just childish. Hell, even Family Guy is more creative with the names.<br /><br />Was the book funny? In some parts it was. I'll admit, the first three chapters are so absurdly funny, it's beautiful. And the ending was funny as well- I felt like someone had spiked my coffee with LSD by the time I got to the end.<br /><br />Lastly, the book's worst crime is that it's downright BORING. There's hardly any plot here, the characters, particularly Yossarian, are unlikeable and shallow, and the book is too long for its own good, yet simultaneously not long enough for the amount of stuff crammed in it.<br /><br />Overall, this book was incredibly frustrating to read. If you want a good satire, read Slaughterhouse Five. It's better than this.<br /><br />OK guys, I am now ready to be crucified for my negative review. Hammer away at the nails.end.

0385339585|5.0|The book carries the reader up an uphill ramp of excitement with no time wasted.  The book opens with strong momentum in scene one.  We meet the billionaire who has no will to live and a strong will to carry out a meticulous plan to take down his dysfunctional and fragmented family in his last hours to live.  The malicious punch has everything to do with a will which covers an eleven billion dollar fortune.  The family is led to believe that everthing is going to be divided.  In the expiring seconds the billionaire's will is re-written and an unbenounced illegitimate child in the Brazilian woods is named soul heir to the estate.  The story glides along at a riveting speed when a recovering alcoholic is brought in and tasked to hunt down the missionary through a maze of alligators, two seater planes, waters dense in alligators and anacondas and disease infested locales.  What he ends up learning along the way is a very delightful and surprising message.  John Grisham pilots this one very tactfully to the very end.  Very seldom do I read a book where I cannot find anything negative to say about it.  The visibility in Grisham's writing style lends itself to the fast pace of the tale.  The story comes together like a fine wine with an equally delightful aftertaste.

0385504225|3.0|Much as I enjoyed \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" as a literal page turner, the same does not apply to the follow-up, Brown's \\"The Lost Symbol.\\" The story line is not as propulsive as in his earlier works, and the focus--or the macguffin--is not as clearly enunciated as in the previous stories.  A useful plot twist energizes the last portion of the book but the journey is not quite worth the destination.  No problem--Brown will sell the story to Hollywood, Hanks will continue to walk through the role with a puzzled look and more bad hair.

B0012K1ILW|2.0|I am a moderate (but not fanatical) fan of Erykah Badu, in that I own and frequently listen to Baduzym and Mama's Gun and love those albums.  I was disapointed by this one, it is a clear notch below in terms of musicality and inventiveness, and lacks some of the \\"freshness\\" of the other two.  To be sure there are a couple of outstanding tracks, like \\"That Hump\\", that has some of her trademark musicality and unique combination of vocal harmony and mood, but this is balanced with an unfortunate introduction of cheesy \\"gag\\" interludes and other bizarre interruptions that remind me of rap albums from the 1990s.  Unfortunate direction, I hope she moves away from that and goes back to pure music, those \\"interludes\\" are embarassing.

0446567329|3.0|This love story has some compelling aspects, but overall Dear John is just not a fulfilling read.  While the character of John is somewhat complex, Savannah seems too perfect to be real.  She goes to church every Sunday, builds homes for those in need, is the perfect daughter, wants to work with autistic children after college, is saving herself for her true love, quickly apologizes if she says something uncomplimentary about someone - you get the picture.  It just gets kind of annoying after a while.  When you meet Tim (who is the male version of Savannah and is also in love with her), you can immediately predict that he is going to win her in the end.  It doesn't help that the first chapter is John watching Savannah from afar years after their time together has ended.  In my opinion, John's father is the most interesting character in the novel and his relationship with John is the only reason I gave this book three stars, instead of one.  The author does a nice job developing how father and son interact during various phases of John's life and those pages are moving.  The rest of the story just did nothing for me.

0425220931|5.0|Upon a recommendation by a friend, I initially bought Victor's DVD, \\"Groove Shop\\". It has been a major revelation in how I approach thinking about, and playing music (natch I'm a bass player). When I bought the DVD, I also noticed his book \\"The Music Lesson\\" advertised, and after watching the DVD's (there are two in the \\"Groove Shop\\"), I looked into reviews on his book, and felt it would be a good addition to my expanding Wooten library.     I'm very glad I bought this book, as it fleshes out Victor's music ideas that are the basis of his teachings and lessons on the DVD's. It was hard to put this book down; at the same time it was almost over the top in believability, as it forces you at times to read it with a child's imagination, and accept the world through a child's eyes, and sensibility. And very quickly you do, as it requires your imagination to to work in non-linear ways. The more your read, the easier it is to believe after awhile that the concepts put forth are valid, and obtainable.     I highly recommend this book not only for bassists, but for all musicians, and especially anyone interested in a better understanding of music, and it's concepts. But I want to clarify that \\"The Music Lesson\\" is written in such a fashion as to help you look at life in a new way as well. Its main quality is teaching you that there are many ways to see the same scene, or experience.     As a quote on the front of the book by Tony Levin (a phenomenal bass player in his own right) says, \\"Victor Wooten is the Carlos Castaneda of music\\", and he's right!     Buy this book to learn more about life, as well as music. And let the young musician read this as well, as it is written in an easy style to read. Enjoy!
006176759X|5.0|I loved this book. I really don't watch the Hills, so I'm assuming a lot of this is based off her experiences, though I don't remember the Hills turning out quite like this! I enjoyed it though. Very easy read, I read it in three days, two of which I couldn't put it down. I just started the second book, which I hear is even better. I'm glad I got both of them and don't have to wait to find out what happens!! The only thing I didn't like was the in depth description of EVERY outfit someone had on. I know thats her career but after a while that part annoyed me. Other than that, very easy fun read. Loved it!
B002SJIO5E|3.0|Not the best, but an ok movie. Recommend renting instead of purchasing unless you want to add to your blu-ray/dvd collection.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|I realize that most of the reviewers have raved about this book and I personally loved it along with the message passed on by Christopher.  The biggest issue that I had with the book was it read like a very long newspaper or magazine article.  Christopher takes us on his personal journey which he frequently interrupts with side pockets of information and side stories with little to no transition.  These transitions can confuse the reader and distract from the overall quality of the book.  If he could segue into each related segment more fluidly I would definitely rate this 5 stars, but the transition elements that give us the intimate details about either running or his eventual travelling companions is lacking smooth transition elements.  It's almost like reading a book by somoene with a case of A.D.D.      Now, as far as the actual content, I absolutely LOVED the book.  It does inspire you to kick off your shoes and start running until you collapse from exhaustion.  I fall into the FiveFinger runner category and I've gained a new appreciation for both barefoot runners as well as ultrarunners and now have a much better insight on WHY and HOW they are able to take running to such extremes.  I would be a very lucky person to ever be able to acheive a similar mindset as these ultrarunners, but the book has inspired me to try and make that change.    One last note, I felt like I was left a bit hanging in the end because Christopher didn't convey to the reader what happened to his companions.  Did Billy and Jenn eventually get sick from their desert drink and where did they end up after the race?  Barefoot Ted? etc...    If you are a runner or aspire to run, read this book.  I think I'm going to give it a second read so I can do some research of my own on some of the foods/drinks he discussed and hopefully gain even more of an emotional lift from his experience.

B002XTXFU8|5.0|Bronson was one of my favorite if not my favorite film from last year so it was an easy purchase to make this one of the first Blu-Rays I owned that I wasn't re-purchasing from DVD. Like its protagonist Bronson isn't an easy film to explain.   On one hand you can say its a biopic of Michael Peterson, a british prisoner who has rechristend himself in his fighting name of Charles Bronson and made a name for himself by causing riots and taking hostages so many times He's now serving a life sentence in his own prison to protect guards and other convicts from him. The movie isn't so simple though taking what I call a more gonzo approach to the idea of a biopic of a man who's so off kilter a personality. The best critics and even director Nicolas Winding Refn admit that the film is operating on different levels. The normal biopic features Peterson narrating his life, the story of young man who leads an existence engaging in fights at an early age until at nineteen He decides to rob a post office. He's sentenced to seven years in prison and once in decides to make the most of it engaing in fights and other violence.   Then theres another angle as Bronson puts on a suit, paints his face and narrates his life story to a crowd, telling jokes and basically as He says from his opening becoming famous through his actions as a prisoner. This is more the surreal aspect of the film exploring a duality between the personality and the person I found interesting. Even the lifestory reenactments seem to use a technique. The film opens on a vicious fight with a caged Bronson squaring off against six guards scored to a normal song that does provide the feeling of general disturbance of the man. Certain scenes want to show this reality while the movie switches soundtracks to a more classical score when Bronson is retelling his life becoming more of the showman He wants to be. We go from rock and roll to Wagner at the drop of a hat to emphasize a more larger than life quality to the story.Refn's an interesting director who totatlly seems to have changed his direction from his films like the Pusher series which were more realistic compared to this. This change of tone and style definitely makes him a filmmaker I'm more interested in seeing after this film but I'll be remiss if I didn't mention Tom Hardy's performance. The film has become mainly recognized for Hardy's work reminiscent to Eric Bana as Mark Brandon Read in Chopper. Unlike Bana who became known outside of Australia because of Chopper though, Hardy's been working for nearly ten years in films like Black Hawk Down and Layer Cake. He's mostly been a character actor in small roles gaining some leads in other films. After this though I can definitely see this changing as He totally owns his role as Bronson. He bulked up considerably shaved his head, but more than that He has an almost animal intensity in the performance. He's funny, He's brash but at the end you do in a way see the wounded animal existing underneath the persona- again something reminiscent of Bana's performance in Bronson. I enjoyed Refn's direction but I can definitely recommend the film from the performance of the lead actor.  The film is a biopic of an interesting person that thankfully doesn't glorify the man. There is a free Bronson campaign but it never seems to argue for this idea. In the end its a entertaining film with great direction and an amazing performance. Like I said this is one of the first Blus I purchased so I'm not as good at others at judging picture and the like. I've heard some reviews that have said the pictures good but not great but to me the picture popped with an amazing ammount of sharpness and detail while still retaining a film like appearance. The sound though is spectacularly good benefiting the dialogue and music selection. Magnolia thankfully isn't a company that skimps on extras for either DVD or Blu-Ray and there is a great selection of features including a making of that includes some ofBronson's family, select interviews with Refn, Hardy and actor Matt King. Theres also a feature on training Tom Hardy as well as behind the scenes footage and everything is rounded out with recorded monologues from Charles Bronson himself. The last feature should be something interesting like interviews with Mark Read were on Chopper, but truthfully asides from the rambling nature the audio isn't very good.  Thats a good ammount of material rounding out an excellent disc. Like I said I loved the film and would definitely recommend the Blu Ray for fans of the movie. However you can see the movie though its a definite recommendation from me.

B000M07B5K|5.0|There's a couple songs on Before and After Science that seriously might rank as some of the very best songs I've EVER heard in my life, and I'm not even a serious Eno fan like many others.  Read on to find out which ones.<br /><br />\\"King's Lead Hat\\" reminds me of the Talking Heads and the late 70's Bowie/Eno collaboration period.  The verse melody is quite weird, and the chorus is highly memorable.  I love it.  We need more weirdness like this in todays music to make it more interesting and less commercial.<br /><br />On a side note, thank you to the reader comment about deciphering the words \\"king's lead hat\\" and being able to spell \\"talking heads\\".  I seriously wasn't aware of this.  Very very clever.<br /><br />\\"Backwater\\" is an alright song.  It's definitely melodic, but sounds a bit... like a nursery rhyme maybe?  I don't know.  Not a favorite.<br /><br />\\"Energy Fools the Magician\\" steps away from the highly melodic direction Eno took for this album.  It's ambient music done right, though it's definitely too short, and wouldn't be out of place on Another Green World either.<br /><br />For some bizarre reason, \\"Here He Comes\\" reminds me of Cat Stevens.  I'm not entirely sure why, but perhaps it has something to do with the folk-rock vibe I get from it.  My only complaint is that it's a couple minutes overlong, and the song isn't quite as melodic as Eno probably thought it was, otherwise he would've shortened it.<br /><br />One of the songs I consider truly amazing and a showcase of Eno's talents is \\"Julie With\\".  THIS song hits my emotions quite hard.  It definitely reminds me of being in a boat on a lake somewhere while gray clouds roll by, indicating something ominous is ready to enter the picture.<br /><br />\\"By the River\\" is a pretty good showcase of raw emotions and vocals, and \\"Spider and I\\" *is the best song ever*, haha.  I seriously can't put into words how much I truly get caught up in this songs atmosphere, and dreary vocal melody.  A true delight for anyone who isn't afraid to break down and cry while listening to music.  I'm not!  I do it all the time!  I'm crying right now just thinking about the song!<br /><br />An Eno album that delivers with the highly melodic songwriting above everything else

015206396X|5.0|To begin with, the book got off to a somewhat clumsy start. The narrator interrupted the action of the first chapter too often with explanations and descriptions of the world Graceling is set in. In addition, I found the construction of many of the sentences to be awkward and perhaps even pedestrian. While the book did amuse me and even made me laugh right from the beginning, I withheld my opinion as to whether or not I thought it was good until about 100 pages into it. By that time, I was madly in love with all of the characters, even the villains (they were just so good at being villainous, and you have to admire someone for being good at what they do!).    The world Cashore has created is vividly realized, especially the Graces (the extreme skills that one is born with) that some of the characters are gifted with. As the characters developed, I realized more and more how much thought the author had put into these unique gifts. Furthermore, it was a joy to watch the characters develop and undergo self-realization as they coped with the burden of their Graces. But best of all, I loved watching the the subtle development of the romance between the characters. It was in no way contrived or unrealistic and it developed so naturally that it crept up on me, just as it did them.     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  POSSIBLE SPOILER HERE!   I'll add a word of caution for parents, though. There are a couple of love scenes, though they are not at all graphic and a contraceptive is used and its importance is emphasized. As Katsa is only 16, some parents might feel it is inappropriate. I'll add a quote directly from the book: \\"And the wrestling turned to something slow and gentle and yielding, and they were warm, and occupied with each other, for some time.\\" That is the whole thing, the second of two \\"love scenes.\\" In addition, the characters have no plans to get married and are, in fact, set against it.  END OF SPOILER!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Overall, I loved this book and would recommend it! Once I finish sending this review, I'm ordering the second book!
1400049628|5.0|My boyfriend and I have a love for all things zombie, video games, books etc so when I saw this book, I knew I had to get it. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend who does not like reading books. He saw it wrapped under the tree and said with great disappointment \\"you got me a book?\\" I knew he would love it but he was so sad that I wasnt sure. When he finally opened it, he laughed hysterically and immediately starting flipping through the pages. This is to say the only book I have ever seen him sit down to read from start to finish and he loved it!!!!

B001PPLIEG|4.0|If you are a fan of the series, then you will enjoy it. The plot is good, lots of action, and he finally starts getting over Vesper. Mr. Greene is weird, but it works. I'm not sure I 100% like how Daniel Craig plays him. He takes the whole effortlessly good thing a little too far. But all in all, it was a good movie.

B000YA9LK6|5.0|Love this set! A must have for the Polar Express fans. My son loves it, he often goes in his room and follows along to the cd. He is only 4 and knows when to turn the pages. There are no sound cues to turn the page.
B00367OALO|5.0|I have noticed alot of the older HIM fans like myself, are not enjoying the tracks, and I will admit to being taken off Guard. BUT I LOVED IT!! and for the ones saying its not him, ville sounds different and so on, he is! He sobered up, and put his self out there in this album alot more that the others, and i give him major credit for it. It is painful to be so raw and to expose yourself like that. To the people who are criticizing the direction the band has taken: have you never made a change in your life? Have you ever shown a side of your personality that people usually dont see? I bet you have. I adore this album, and I cant wait to see them live in april! <3 HIM

B00275EGWY|5.0|\\"The Hurt Locker,\\" brilliantly directed by Kathryn Bigelow from a script by Mark Boal, is set in 2004 during the Iraq War. Baghdad is a tense place for the American soldiers whose mission it is to identify and defeat the insurgents.  Their task is made even more difficult by the fact that anyone could be a potential suicide bomber; any car could be wired to blow up without warning; and IED's (improvised explosive devices) are cleverly hidden.  Staff Sergeant William James, played by Jeremy Renner, is a swaggering, chain-smoking bomb tech who takes insane risks as the team leader of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit in the U.S. Army's Bravo Company.  His disapproving fellow soldiers are Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), who prefers following protocol to improvising, and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), a young man who fears that each day will be his last.  Sanborn and Eldridge worry that Sergeant James, who is unbelievably arrogant and reckless, will get them all killed.<br /><br />Bigelow effectively used hand-held cameras to give her film the look and feel of a documentary.  We hold our breaths as the soldiers embark on one dangerous operation after another.  Each time the men approach a possible bomb site, they must be on the lookout for booby-traps and snipers.  Sanborn and Eldridge provide cover for James, who attempts to defuse the device without blowing up the entire neighborhood.  Needless to say, this is not a job for the faint of heart.<br /><br />The performances are uniformly excellent.  Renner is superb as a man who enjoys taking apart complicated bombs; he even saves pieces of them as souvenirs.  James briefly shows his human side when he chats about his family back home and befriends a garrulous and brash Iraqi boy. While on duty, however, he is possessed, sometimes stripping off his protective gear so that he can perform his hazardous undertaking more comfortably. Sanborn is a cool customer who gradually succumbs to the stress of living on the edge.  Eldridge is in over his head; he cannot believe that he is stuck in this filthy, stifling, and inhospitable place, fighting a war that cannot be won.<br /><br />This is a terrifying, disturbing, and intensely moving film, in which Bigelow puts the viewer on the mean streets of Baghdad, where the difference between friend and foe is not always clear.  We feel sorry for both the American soldiers and the innocent Iraqi civilians who are caught in the crossfire.  The movie is slightly marred by an unfortunate scene towards the end in which two characters engage in conversation that is so preachy and heavy-handed that it stands out because of its lack of subtlety.  Still, \\"The Hurt Locker\\" is a timely and provocative film that challenges us to consider the huge toll that war takes, both emotionally and physically, on the brave men and women who serve their country so unselfishly.Eldridge is in over his head; he cannot believe that he is stuck in this filthy, stifling, and inhospitable place, fighting a war that cannot be won.

1416955070|3.0|Wow.  I can't remember the last time it took me a week to read a book.  The book is really big and while I enjoyed the story, I found I had to spend a lot of time thinking about what things were and who was who.        I feel mixed about the characters.  The main girl character, Clary, was just okay for me.  I never really connected to her like I wanted to, or felt any warmth from her.  But I did like two of the male characters- Jace and Simon.  I loved Jace and his arrogant ways--and how he was soft- hearted when he wanted to be.  And I thought Simon seemed to be one of those totally dorky guys that are hot when you really look at them.       The story was fun.  There was lots of elements to the plot that were new to me.  And there were a bunch of surprises.  Some I saw coming, and some I didn't--especially a big one at the end of the story.  I have the second and the third books in The Mortal Instrument series and look forward to reading them soon!
B002YIHO7I|5.0|First of all, all of you who gave the CD anything less than 4 stars must be on crack cocaine!    The CD is a breath of fresh air in this day of overproduced, over packaged so-called talent, replete with half naked booty shakers........\\"All the Single ladies\\"  The music industry is dying because of a major lack of talent.    Thank God for Sade.  Enjoy it, because she will never make another CD and the industry no longer produces artists!  They only produce soft porn entertainers like Beyonce, Shakira, Fergie, Pink.................    Celebrate The groups genius and originality.    In this hypercritical world just chill and enjoy true artistry at its best.    Great CD!

0061537969|5.0|THE ART OF RACING IN THE RAIN by Garth Stein<br /><br />This is one of the best books I have read in years. If you love dogs, you will be hooked on page one. If you don't, you will love and respect them by the time this novel is over. Even I who own four cringed a little when I read this was a tale told from a dog's, perspective. But that is the genius of it. Sure there have been other one-note stories of dog love and loss, but what we realize quickly is that we, the readers, are viewing life like Enzo. We don't have the words to express how we really feel. We don't care about the medical causes or terms that describe human physical or psychological malfunctions. And we know our life on earth will end.<br />The Art of Racing in the Rain title refers to Enzo's owner being a race car driver and the Zen of succeeding at that sport. That was a stretch for me, at first. But that's why there's a richness to this book that is too often missing in those that pander to our nostalgia and sentimentality. About a third of the way through the book I was counting pages--the drama of a wife dying of cancer had run its course--and then the story takes a startling turn that will keep you up all night. The dog perspective gives us a Hitchcock like inside knowledge of events that happened that he and we are unable to do anything about.<br /><br />A secondary benefit of seeing the world through Enzo's eyes is that there are things, like courtroom, the death scene (yes there is one) and some of the routine of Denny's work that we can thankfully skip. A new writer puts things down as they occur (like in a diary) or as they occur to him or her. A good writer rearranges these with readers in mind--what will hook their interest, what is the major turning point, what  scenes build up to that, what at the end would suggest some revelation beyond the plot's resolution. But a great writer has some mechanism by which he can give and withhold bits of information from the audience. He plays them. They try to fill in what's missing and, whether they are right or wrong, become active partners in the creative process. They become its writers.<br /><br />It's tempting to shamelessly waive racing symbols in reviewing The Art of Racing in the Rain. The book brings the crowd to its feet and the little twist at the end deserves a checkered flag. But more than this, Garth Stein proves himself a master storyteller. And from him we can learn what's behind the magic of writing as much as be enthralled by the plight of this wonderful dog, his master and the man's daughter. This novel wins a first place trophy.<br /><br />- John Lehman, [..]n what's missing and, whether they are right or wrong, become active partners in the creative process. They become its writers.

B001202LRM|5.0|Yes i'm a metal freak. This album ruled the day and my zune along with Iowa. Then they steadily declined until by the time All hope is gone came out, they lost my interest completely. But anyways, heres how I rate each of the songs on this album:<br /><br />1. 742617000027(Instrumental) - Weird, repetitive, and annoying<br /><br />2. Sic - 11/10 - OMG the perfect song to kick things off with speedy double-bass from Joey to greet you right off the bat!<br /><br />3. Eyeless - 10/10 - Awesome song love the furious singing from Corey and some an added touch of melody from Jim<br /><br />4. Wait and Bleed - 10/10 - The perfect choice for a single with a great sense of melody and a fast pace(as usual)<br /><br />5. Surfacing - 10/10 - Totally ANGRY. Middle fingers in the air to the world.<br /><br />6. Spit It Out - 11/10 - My absolute favorite Slipknot song and a headbangers paradise! To this day I dont have a clue how they got the guitar to sound like it does.<br /><br />7. Tattered and Torn - 5/10 - Didn't care too much for this one; very creepy and repetitive like the first<br /><br />8. Me Inside - 9/10 -  Solid song overall. Really loved the singing on the bridge right after the second chorus. Jim's vocals are on the front stage in this one<br /><br />9. Liberate - 10/10 - Another great headbanger song with a catchy chorus and Jim's great vocals on the verses once again.<br /><br />10. Prosthetics - 4/10 - Kinda long and dull and yes, you guessed it weird and repetitive. Also takes forever for the vocals to kick in, which aren't too particularly good either.<br /><br />11. No Life - 10/10 - Awesome rapping by Jim and Corey once again provides us with an angry, catchy, sing-along chorus. Sweet.<br /><br />12. Diluted - 8/10 - Didn't enjoy the verses much, but the chorus and bridge are A++.<br /><br />13. Only One - 10/10 - Love the speed-of-sound rapping by Jim and of course the SPECTACULAR drum solo from the never silent Joey.<br /><br />14. Scissors - 1/10 - Kinda wished this one would end. Long n' lousy imo.<br /><br />15. Eeyore - 8/10 - This one is pretty much Corey's personal anger venting session along with Get This. Notably 1:47 to 2:17. Geez dude.sonal anger venting session along with Get This. Notably 1:47 to 2:17. Geez dude.
B001TD1XWG|5.0|Ok, I will admit the first few times I listened to the album I thought is was terrible. Then after a few more listens I really started to like it. I'm a fan of rock and rap so the rock part of it is cool with me. If you don't like rock music then this isn't an album for you. I'm really liking this crossover album, I can't wait for the next one. A lot of people won't admit to liking this CD in front of others but go home and listen to it when no one is around. So listen to it a few times before making your final decision.

0812550706|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time. Ender is a great character, I've never met anybody who has read this book and not loved it. I've read all 6 books in the Ender series, and my reccomendation is to just read this one, then read Ender's Shadow (book 4 which is the same time frame and told from the point of view of another character) Books 1 and are good as stand alone books, and the other books are ok, but not must reads.

1592400876|3.0|Fantastic book title! This book about punctuation came highly recommended, but I found it pretentious, chatty, and tedious. If you are looking for a concise guide to the use of commas, dashes, etc., this book is not for you. Rather, it provides a chatty history of English punctuation, which may serve as a good nighttime sedative.

B002NUULNG|1.0|Let's get one thing clear:  I love Ghost in the Shell.  I have everything ever released on DVD.  As far as Cyberpunk goes, this is it.  Plain and simple.<br /><br />Let's talk about what's wrong with GITS: 2.0<br /><br />They took the 2008 Japanese Bluray and ran a blur filter over it.  Want your DVD to look the same?  Turn the sharpness down to about 20%.  Ta-da!<br /><br />Added in new 3d animation that looks like something from a Playstation One or 2 at best.  Low rez, crap quality that has artifacting and residue. We're talking Youtube video quality.  I'm not impressed. Going from one type of animation type to another in mid movie is really painful.<br /><br />On top of all that, deciding to change entire color pallets, substituting Amber for Green.  Ya that's great.  Thanks.<br /><br />This is worse than what Lucas did to Star Wars.  Far worse.<br /><br />It's crap.<br /><br />I am very disappointed.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I've had my X41's for about 3 weeks and I must say, they've changed the way I enjoy gaming and watching movies and television. I actually bought these because I like to have the audio up pretty loud while I play COD, with a wife and a 3 year old sleeping on the same floor as our media room this wasn't the best situation. They serve the purpose of keeping my sound at the level I enjoy as well as being silent from several feet down the hall. Beyond that, I must say these things absolutely changed the way I think about and play xbox, most particularly MW2. I am able to hear little sounds I never knew were there, it really shows the depth of the sound field. The best benefit of all however has been the ability to hear when the enemy is trying to get sneaky on me, I can tell what direction one of those \\"Care package Knife-monkeys\\" are coming from so I can pop a round in his dome before he reaches me. I can hear the direction shots are being fired in and quickly react, my kill/death ratio has gone up .3 since getting these, for those that like to have empirical evidence. The surround is great and makes watching anything from The Office to Inglourious Basterds an even more pleasurable experience. I can crank the volume to an optimum level and have some fun late into the night without disturbing my sleeping beauties.        I should address some of the product issues the other reviewers had, which I did not. In the interest of not coming off like a Turtle Beach fanboy, I did have some popping and cracking a couple of times during the first week I owned these, I'm chalking it up to interference from something else because I haven't heard it anymore. The popping was not as bad for me as the other reviewer who stated they \\"ripped the headphones off their head\\" and possibly had hearing damage. It wasn't bad at all, just some crackling and a that was it (I didn't have these ALL the way up though so that could have made a difference.) There is a VERY faint hissing or what have you, during any quiet lobby in multiplayer game chat, or private chat session. The hissing is instantly inaudible once the match/round/race/ect ect.. begins. I haven't had any other players comment on hearing it, I even asked my brother who plays MW2 with me all the time (who happens to be a staunch Turtle Beach hater because of the buzz found in those cheap models that Game Stop sells) and he can't pick up anything on his ear piece nor can any of the other clowns I play with daily. Installation was a snap once I figured out I didn't need to buy an old xbox AV plug with optical audio out, TAKE SPECIAL NOTE HERE-MY Plasma has an optical out which I plugged right in and anything playing on the screen plays through the phones, IF you DO NOT have this feature on your TV and don't have the old plug (not included in new xbox bundles) then you'll need to get on eBay or maybe even Amazon and find the correct plug that gives you AV+Optical and still use your HDMI. Now I'm gaming on a 60\\" Plasma in HD via HDMI and hearing it all in 5.1 Dolby Digital via the Optical out on my Panasonic HDTV plugged into the TB transmitter.          The short and simple: VERY good product, looks cool, feels great on my noggin, transmits with a good range, sounds awesome, heavy bass, cool package, easy to install, basically no problems, and has a neat holster on top for holding the headset when I'm done.   I highly recommend these for anyone that plays FPS or anything that they want the \\"submersed\\" feeling while watching. Also a great addition for anyone that just likes to watch TV late and not make noise bother family.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Being in my mid-twenties, I think I'm much older than the intended audience for this movie, but I have fond childhood memories of Disney, so the rave reviews for this one led me to see it in the theatre. And I absolutely loved it! It had everything I wanted in a Disney movie: fun songs, a creepy villain, and a touching plot that made me cry at least once but ultimately left me fully satisfied.<br /><br />The best part for me, though, was the rich historical setting--1912 New Orleans. Disney has been praised for taking a bold step with a  black heroine, but even more important for me was the fact that her station in life was portrayed realistically. Rather than trying to hide historical injustices, The Princess and the Frog faces them head on and shows that it's possible to achieve happiness despite all difficulties.<br /><br />Tiana is not only black but poor, working multiple jobs in the hopes of one day saving enough money to start her own business. The ditzy white Charlotte, on the other hand, has plenty of money and gets everything she wants from her indulgent father. We see at the very beginning that white people lived in fancy mansions, while black people lived in tiny shacks. And yet we also see that Tiana's childhood was a happy one, with a loving family and a close-knit community. There are some powerful messages throughout the movie about how hard work is important, but a loving family is more important by far.<br /><br />I don't want to spend too much time summarizing the plot; suffice it to say that one character's greedy attempt to use voodoo for personal gain results in both Tiana and a foreign prince being turned into frogs. The majority of the movie consists of their travels through the bayou, searching for a voodoo priestess to turn them back. Of course, they encounter all sorts of interesting creatures in their travels--the firefly Ray was possibly my favourite character in the movie--and learn some valuable lessons about themselves on the way.<br /><br />I was really intrigued by the whole voodoo aspect; it's a belief system that I don't know anything about, but just being aware that the magic system of the movie had a whole history behind it gave the story a satisfying sense of depth. I came away from the movie wanting to learn more about both voodoo and the general history of race relations in the American south (and have, in fact, purchased books about both topics since then). This, to me, is the mark of a good story: The Princess and the Frog not only is rewarding in its own right, but leaves the viewer inspired to explore related areas. I'll definitely be purchasing this movie once it becomes available, because I know it's one that I'll want to see again.y the whole voodoo aspect; it's a belief system that I don't know anything about, but just being aware that the magic system of the movie had a whole history behind it gave the story a satisfying sense of depth.

This, to me, is the mark of a good story: The Princess and the Frog not only is rewarding in its own right, but leaves the viewer inspired to explore related areas. I'll definitely be purchasing this movie once it becomes available, because I know it's one that I'll want to see again.

1402713185|5.0|I am a high school English teacher, and I am a huge fan of the original Treasure Island.  That said, I love the Classic Start series as a mother who believes in introducing my children to the classics from a very early age. I began using the series with my daughter when she was five.  We have read Black Beauty, The Little Princess, Heidi, and Pollyanna to name a few, so I am very familiar with the content of the series, and I keep coming back for more.      My son just turned six.  There is no way that he would be able to sit through nor understand the original, but with this abridged version, he not only becomes familiar with the story, he falls in love with it as well.  We began reading Treasure Island last night, and he begged for more and more.  Finally, after six chapters I insisted that I needed to read to his older sister.  While I did, this little kindegartner slugged through another chapter, struggling over every word to try to get more of the story.  I couldn't have been more thrilled; that is the love of reading and the love of good literature with which I am trying to bless my children.      Classic Starts are a fantastic way to begin, in my opinion.  I see no difference between a beginning pianist first learning an easy version of a classical piano concerto and a young reader first introduced to an abridged version of a classic that, in it's original form would be above both his context and vocabulary level.  I am sure that when my son does encounter the original, and he will--I'll make sure of that--he will not only be more ready, he will be more excited to get the rest of the story, thanks to his familiarity with and fondness for Billy Bones, Jim, and Long John Silver.  My thanks, Classic Starts.

B0025KVLTC|5.0|The mono is better overall. Rigby is a total experience in mono also. You really need the first four albums in mono along with pepper, mmt, and revolver. Hopefully some of the mono albums will be individually released for people. Pepper in mono blew me away and so did revolver.
B002PMV9FG|4.0|I am always amazed that the producers get as much of the book into the movie as they do.  As with the others (movies), if you are looking for a literal translation of the book this movie will frustrate you BUT if you are looking for fun, interesting special effects and for the 3 main characters to continuing on their quest, you will enjoy this movie. The end bothered me because it seemed to leave so much out but I'm not sure if they are saving Dumbledore's funeral for the opening sequence of the next one.  We shall see.
0847830942|5.0|This book is an important contribution to the history of bicycles. A more appropriate title might have been, \\"The Golden Age of Handbuilt Touring Bicycles\\". A quick survey reveals that 50 of the 50 bicycles featured have fenders - 46 have luggage racks and 45 are equipped with lights/generators. Just so you know what you are getting.    The machines featured are wonders of imagination - starships of their day: the lavish craftsmanship is unsurpassed. Many of these bikes are turned out in all chrome.    Kudos to Jan Heine, the author, for the vision to produce this book. The text is crisp and insightful - obviously the product of years of research, uh. . . strike research, insert obsession!    Kudos also to Jean-Pierre Praderes. This is a doctoral thesis on how to photograph bicycles - a perfect mix of full view shots and fascinating detail.    If you are a road bike nut, such as myself, you may want to buy Jan Heine's new book, \\"The Competition Bicycle. It will pop up with a title search on e-bay. I do not have this book yet, but, will order it based on the quality of the one reviewed here.     Such a glowing review may leave you wondering if I have some financial interest in this endeavor. No, I am just an avid reader and bicycle enthusiast who wants to share a wonderful find with other bike advocates.    Seldon Bradley  Indianapolis, IN
B002YICN74|5.0|Those who listen to this album with the ears of prejudice will be shocked at its maturity, depth, and musicianship. However, if you're at all familiar with the Jonas Brothers, you'll already know that Nick is different from his brothers, in that he is more mature, musically and perhaps even personally. Though the Brothers produce teen pop, what Nick does here is much more adult and possesses only slight pop sounds (mostly on \\"Who I Am\\"). This is more of an attempt not to completely alienate the existing fanbase, I think. No doubt Nick still has a long way to go, but this album makes huge leaps in the right direction. He has the potential to be a great artist, and this album proves it.

B002BSHWUU|4.0|I was so excited to get this box set!  I'm 22, so I didn't grow up in Beatlemania, but my parents have played them for years.  I only had a few CD's (Sgt. Peppers, Rubber Soul, and some greatest hits) and I needed more.  I thought that this set would be the perfect opportunity to get all the music at a good price.  13 CD's plus 2 CD from past masters.  That's 15 CD's for 170 something and almost $10 a CD.  Really not that bad.  From a price stand point, I can't be pissed, it is a good deal.    The part that upset me was the quality of the CD cases.  I liked the idea of flip out hard paper; they hold the CD well enough and don't create as much waste as normal CD cases.  They also provide a ton of room for pictures.  The problem is that some of the pages of the CD information are misprinted.  My Hard Day's Night info insert has some imperfections, including duplicated pages and missing content.  Some of the other info insert also have minor flaws.  My White Album also had to be re-glued in some areas.  Other than these minor issues, I think it's a great buy.      The small misgivings prevent me from giving the greatest band of all time a 5 out of 5.  I think a 4 ½ would be appropriate.  The content is 10 out of 5, but it's The Beatles, what else would you expect?

B000QCS8TW|2.0|All the positives written about this series are true - the character development, plot devices, shakespearean killings, and non formulaic writing are really very attractive, and will keep you reading right until the end.  And there's the problem.  GRRM has not finished the series.  The next book was promised years ago, and the estimated date for publication keeps getting pushed out.  If GRRM keeps to this pace, the last book will be finished sometime in 2030!  It is the opinion of many that he has lost interest, and is now focusing on more important things like the miniseries, and flying around the world to various fan events.<br /><br />Be warned - you could invest a lot of time and money in this series and leave it feeling very unfulfilled.<br /><br />My recommendation would be to leave it on the shelf, and buy something else.
0812973992|5.0|I am not going to say much.  I rarely rate books, or anything for that matter on Amazon. However I found this novel to be such a great read that I wanted to encourage others to buy it or go to the library and check it out.

B002SJIO54|5.0|I've always wondered why, in science fiction movies dealing with human/alien contact, the aliens are almost always the bad guys.  It's always them invading us, or us getting out there and meeting with aliens who turn out to be midlessly vicious or innately evil.  Assuming that there are probably a lot of alien civilizations in the hundred billion odd galaxies in the universe, it's not unreasonable to think that some of them will turn out to be warlike.  But we know that humans have launched wars more than occasionally, so it always seemed to me that there should be some alien invasion movies where the humans are the invaders, or some where aliens arrive at Earth and are greeted by humanity's mean side (\\"Alien Nation\\" did this quite a while back, but it was one of the few).  Also, there seemed to be missed opportunities in that in the human/alien conflicts, wouldn't there be situations where neither side was all bad or all good?       Well over the last year or two these very concepts have clearly gotten their day, and District 9 is one of the leaders of the pack.  While not being a totally black-or-white scenario, the human response in this first contact situation turns out not to be as noble as one would like, and disturbingly realistic with numerous real-life parralells.        A massive alien ship enters Earth's atmosphere and rather than hovering over a city like New York or London, ends up over Johannesberg, South Africa, in what's soon to turn out to be an unfortunate irony.  The ship is broken down, out of supplies, doesn't have the ability to communicate, and is packed with what appear to be starving refugees.  Upon the initial arrival of the ship, the whole world is excited at the prospect of contact and the dawn of a new era.  Upon the initial discovery of the aliens's sad state, the whole world is prepared to pitch in and help the hundreds of thousands of new arrivals.  Flash forward twenty years, though, and it's a far grimmer picture.  No new era hasdawned with man being inducted into interstellar society or reaping the economic benefits of contact with and trade with a technologically advanced civilization.  Humanity has never figured out how the alien tech worked and was therefore never able to tap into its potential benefits.  Most of the surviving aliens, even after communication, were no more able to explain how everything functioned than the average modern human passenger on a commercial airplane would be able to tell a stone age tribe how to build their own jets.  The aliens, referred to by humans as 'prawns' (a label considered derisive by many of the aliens) apparantly can't return home, and the costs of housing and accomodating their growing population became something the world started to get tired of.  It also cost a lot to try and figure out how to work their technology, especially their weapons (of huge interest to the nations of the world) and no benefit came from that either.  So twenty years later, rather than being honored guests, the aliens are crammed into a poverty-ridden ghetto in the middle of Johannesberg in a situation that not only bears an uncomfortable resemblance to South Africa's apartheid past, but to other world situations past and present.  Humanity, once so fascinated with the aliens, is tired of them and views them as a burden.  And inside the ghetto known as 'District 9', the 'prawns' have reacted to their deprived state, their seemingly dead-end future, and the hostility of much of the world around them, in the same way humans in the same situations do: they've lost hope, they're attempting to eke out meager livings on the bottom rungs of society (salvaging human landfills for junk and scrap metal, for example), some of them have turned violent in a new prawn undersociety of alien thugs, and many of them have become substance addicts (in the aliens's case, to catfood, originally simply a cheap meal that no one anticipated would have such an addictive effect on their alien physiology).  Human society has attempted to limit the prescence of these 'undesirables' in appalingly familiar ways - confining them to their own ghetto and not letting them out, population control measures (even including forced abortions, in a highly disturbing angle), and now, finally, the time has come that Jonnasberg has decided that they want the aliens out of the city altogether and a private military contractor is preparing to move them - by force if necessary - to a camp in the desert that will be known as District Ten.       We see much of the movie through the eyes of Wikus Van De Merwe (a great performance by Sharlto Copley), a civilian official working with private contractor MNU, and here's part of where the movie picks up its \\"not black or white\\" status: Wikus doesn't see himself as a bad guy, or as 'anti-prawn'; he's aware that the current situation is horrid, is aware that the solution of forcible relocation has all kinds of practical and moral flaws, but seems to see it as the best available option.  He's also guilty himself on at least a couple of occasions of some horrifying actions, but he doesn't view it that way, partly because he's not relating to the alien people the way he would to human people; he actually seems to think he's doing the best thing for them. It's only when some totally unexpected events make Wikus an outsider himself, and he and some of the aliens are forced to work together, that he begins to see the brutality of their daily situation more clearly, and the cold ruthlessness of the private contactor he's been affiliated with.  Also adding to the \\"not black or white\\" angle: some of the prawns Do come off as bad guys - certain ones are beligerant, crude and violent.  If humanity was to judge the prawns ONLY on those representatives they'd have good reason to be wary.  Two obvious real-life parallels here: the folly of judging an entire group or race only by its worst members; and the fact that we're seeing the prawns After years of ill treatment.  Were the nasty ones that violent to begin with, or is it, to at least some degree, a consequence of the way they've been treated?  There's another level to the run-down state of the alien society on Earth, and this one doesn't really have real-life parallels because it's based on alien physiologies and technologies and so on.  It's not asked outright, but it's pretty clear in the subtext - did whatever happened to cripple their ship originally have some direct effect on the aliens themselves, either physically or psychologically?       In the first ten minutes or so of District 9, it became abundantly clear that it was a very well-done movie, but I also thought I might be in for one of the most depressing movies ever made.  It's not though.  There are tragic and melancholy parts to it, even depressing parts, but oh, there are also some parts that are just jaw-droppingly Awesome.  The movie runs the gamut through all kinds of tragedy and triumph, unexpected plot turns, characters changing their points of view both on other individuals and on whole situations, several major turning points.  The prawn aliens are very individualized, with their own personalities, temperaments, etc. - they're as much Characters as the human characters, not just a bunch of aliens where one is indistinguisable from another.  An alien named Christopher Johnson (they all have names that humans can pronounce and would be familiar with in addition to the names in their own click-language, which a number of humans can understand but none are physically capable of speaking) and his young son become major players in a series of unexpected events that also involve Wikus.       Highly cerebral with great action, tremendous visuals, memorable characters and high tension, District 9 is great on all levels.  Highly recommended, although certain disturbing or bloody scenes may be more than many scence fiction fans are used to.  Although really, there's no other way they could havefilmed this and had it be as effective.  Recommended for all except young children.
B002U6CJCO|2.0|Universal Soldier had to be 1 of the best movies of 1992. The unoffical sequels for what they were are good. The offical sequel Universal Soldier The Return was pretty bad. It was a cheeseball of a movie but after seeing Regeneration I like The Return a little better now but sugar coated s**t is still s**t. I reviewed all of the Universal Soldier movies back 6 months ago. 1st thing the cover says Andrei \\"The Pitbull\\" Arlovski who plays New Generation UNI SOL or NGU with Dolph Lundgren who plays a cloned Andrew Scott & Jean Cluade Van Damme as Luc Deverux I thought that's werid well you'll find out why. The story is these Terrorist's have kidnapped some forigen presidents daughter you don't care about them there's no build up to these terrorist's if this president doesn't give into there demands they'll kill his kids & blow a reactor in Chernobyl. This just fails as a sequel becuse it never explains how Van Damme got amnesia. There's no mention of Veronica Roberts what happened to her. Van Damme has a stupid scene where he goes in beats the h**l out of some random guy at a resturant for no reason, The UNI SOL head comms geat looks like s**t. It looks like a school had a contest to design the communication head gear for the new Universal Soldier movie. Dolph is brought in at the 57 minute mark Van Damme & Lundgren are finally on camera together after 70 minutes Van Damme only has 10 minutes screen time maybe less Lundgren has 5 minutes maybe less. It has no link no call backs to the original this is a bland Andrew Scott there's no Traitor no ARE WE HAVING FUN YET no WHEN I SAY JUMP YOU SAY HOW HIGH no necklace of ears. Alien Resurrection Ripley clone 8 had some memory of the original Ellen Ripley. There were call backs to the previous Alien movies. Universal Soldier Regeneration feels more like a reboot or a reimagineing of the original. I will say the action is ok but there was more action in the fight between Van Damme & Lundgren in the 1st movie than the entire Universal Soldier Regeneration movie. You can argue realism all you want there's a scene where they cut off NGU's arm off & put a new 1 on how in the blue f**k is that realistic. Point is it's a failure as a sequel. These people who say it's the best UNI SOL film are probably not fans of JCVD & are probably not fans of the original. The Cover says \\"The best of the Universal Soldier series\\" Neil Miller film school reject . com. Bull s**t Neil Miller on the back Miller strikes again with \\"Van Damme & Lundgren kick some serious a**. I would like to know they have a minute & a half fight Van Damme knocks a pipe through his head & then shoots him in the head with a shot gun. John Hyams directed this he just didn't have the knack his father has his father is Peter Hyams he directed Van Damme's best movie Time Cop & another of Van Damme's movies Sudden Death. So John learn to build your characters. After this I would rather watch Brothers In Arms or Unfinished Business. Here's a movie you have Jean Claude Van Damme & Dolph Lundgren 2 guys who had a rememberable figh in Universal Soldier 1. You give them s****y character development & a damn near forgettable fight scene if it wasn't for the way Van Damme kills Lundgren & \\"I have to tell you somthing\\" it would be forgettable. Of course the camera cuts away when the brain splatter all over the place it's obvious s****y CGI 95% of the blood is CGI blood so it looks like a video game the part with Van Damme in the Terrorist compound where he kills the bad guys in the same way is like a video game you take out Van Damme & Lundgren & you'd have the perfect Call Of Duty Modern Warfare movie. They would have been better off having a CGI Dolph like the CGI Arnie in Terminator Salvation. I don't see why not he was only in the movie 5 minutes at the most him & Van Damme & Lundgren's fight was poorly shot edited spliced up with a lot of shakey cam there is a ton of it in this movie. I was looking forward to this Andrei Arlovski & they didnothing with him he had no personality. Just go watch the trailers & you've seen all the important stuff. I think it would have been better served as a mini series you could have developed a couple of characters per episode. Somebody on here said it had a score close to John Carpenter no it's like they ripped some tracks off of Snatcher on the Sega CD added a couple of beats to it & called it a score. The original had movies score was great it had tension it's soundtrack had f****n' Body Count In Da House by Ice T & Body Count. The TV sequels had at least a half decent score & Biff Naked Spaceman Dance With The Devil by Raggadeath. Even the Return had some b*****n death & heavy metal. At least in The Return Van Damme was a funny perverted mother f****r. here he's a cookie cutter Forrest Gump kick boxer. At least The Return had links to part 1 you knew it was going to be complete s**t by Bill Goldberg being in it I mean Hedi Sanchaze & Kianna Tom were smoking hot you didn't care about there character though you didn't care about anybody's in The Return but in Regeneration Deverux's psychitrist was unattractive plus you didn't care about her character so you get hit in the b***s twice. The Return at least had good action good effects decent fight scenes that weren't spliced together & looked crappy. I just don't know how this game is getting all these props it's like any other direct to video movie if it was as great as people were putting it up to be then why wasn't it released theatrically cause of poor fight scenes edidted spliced badly character develpment on par with Alien vs Predator it's going to sit on you're local video store in the 7 nights section & collect dust. It looks chaeper than the TV movies. I don't hate stright to video cause some of Dolph's movies are solid cause he knows his audience. JCVD you missed out on the expendables to film this it could've been your come back. This was the biggest disappointment since Terminator 3.

0446567329|1.0|I read \\"The Notebook\\" a few years ago and loved it. Read \\"A Walk to Remember\\" a couple of years later, and thought it was ok. Picked up \\"Dear John\\" this week and I just can't stand it. The writing is just bad, period. The characters are so predictable. I think I've grown out of Nicholas Sparks. There are much better books out there - life's too short to read this stuff.
0439023483|5.0|I was given this book to read and I quite liked it!<br />I had no idea what it was about or at what level it was written but I quite enjoyed it!<br /><br />This book is about a future society where the residents participate in an annual mandatory lottery to battle each other in the \\"Hunger Games\\".<br /><br />As I was reading along, I thought this book was written in the 70s.  The way it describes future technology and the way society is set up - it really reminded me of the book \\"Ender's Game\\".  If you like this book, you'll like that one for sure.  But come to find out - this is a \\"new\\" book.  I had no idea.<br /><br />I also did not realize that this book was part of a series.  I just read it for what it was - a story about a young girl forced to participate in these \\"Hunger Games\\".  I didn't feel that there was anything deeper going on here other than what was taking place during the book.  And I think because of that I didn't feel frustrated at any unresolved societal issues.  I just wanted to see what happened to the girl.  And it's really well told.  The story plays out like a light-hearted futuristic movie.  I liked it a lot!  An easy read, too.  Certainly a kid would like this one.  Although, when I was a kid, I never read.  But look at me now!
1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House tells the story of a young Irish girl who becomes the indentured servant on a plantation after her parents die while aboard his ship.

The characters that come to life in this novel will  hold a place in your heart, and will not allow you to stop reading until their story is heard.

B001IFZL50|5.0|I love this show, one of my all times faves. Great chemistry between all the actors. Great humor as well. I have read the book this is based on after I saw the show and it was weird reading the words I have seen someone say. One of the best things about this show was the use of music. As in it has virtually none!  Nearly any song you hear is sung by the actors. In the hummers mostly but it was a nice change. You also get no music in the action scenes.  Great picture quality on the BD and the extras are quite interesting. Haven't listened to the commentaries yet but will do soon.  Packaging on this set is also pretty nice.

0385340575|2.0|I have enjoyed Reacher novels for a long time, but the past few I have read have taken the unique qualities that I enjoyed in the earlier novels and really gone the way of cardboard cutout smash-em-up. They are heading towards formulaic: lots of detail about the military and guns/ammo? Check. Requisite hottie girl? Check. Baddies for Reacher to beat to a pulp? Check. I know Child isn't Hemingway, but the writing feels really dated, even though it's a new book. Who calls a hot girl a babe nowadays? Especially from a college jock! I feel like the Reacher \\"mystique\\" has been spread thinner and thinner lately, with Child using modern hotbuttons to hastily cobble together a plotline. Some elements are overwritten, whereas other elements are very underwritten. Also, I think Reacher reads better in third person instead of first person.

0783229526|3.0|Having missed the movie when it was in theaters, I recently watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas on DVD with much anticipation.  I was sure Johnny Depp would do a knock-out job of impersonating Hunter Thompson, for one thing.  For another, I was looking forward to reliving some of the wilder days of my youth.    Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that Gonzo is really the star of the movie, with Hunter Thompson played as an ever cool but oft bamboozled sidekick who goes along with things no one should go along with, things like terrorizing an innocent waitress in a two-bit diner just for fun.  Worse, Johnny Depp speaks as if he has marbles in his mouth and an iron ring two sizes too small around his vocal chords. He throws off his lines in a monotonic strangled voice that fails to convey anything but disguised up-tightness.  Or perhaps a strangely detached form of insanity.      The depiction of the drug- and alcohol-addled perceptions of these two wild 'n crazy wastrals is masterfully done in many respects.  The camera captures Las Vegas as the lurid reality warp it is, even without the help of consciousness-altering substances. However, there's too much of this not-so-good thing.  It seems like one endless careen through a house of bent mirrors, without any unbent ones to bounce off of.  The viewer needs more touchstones in the non-Gonzo world by which to orient herself in the midst of the madness.  A less relentless onslaught of high jinx would also have been narratively more effective. I wanted to cry out, Enough already!  Take a break from this mother lode of post-adolescent rebellion and let us catch our breath.                  As one who did my share of acid trips back in the day, I also beg to differ from the way that this experience is depicted in the film.  As I recall, anyway, there was way more to it than hallucinogenic morphs of party people into their beastly counterparts. The director (and perhaps his subjects as well) have left out the quiet but piercing insights into the nature of the universe, not to mention the molecules dancing in the walls. LSD really did change the consciousness of a whole generation, and for the better too.  This film offers no evidence of why.

As a Viet Nam vet I can relate to the authors story and realize that the conditions of WWII and WWI were exponentialy worse.

1933771690|4.0|Robert Lanza (page 30) writes about his boyhood curiosity: \\"I rolled logs looking for salamanders and climbed trees to investigate bird nests and holes in the trees. As I pondered the larger existential questions about the nature of life, I began to intuit that there was something wrong with the static, objective reality, I was being taught in school. The animals I observed had their own perceptions of the world, their own realities. Although it wasn`t the world of human beings - of parking lots and malls - it was just as real to them.\\"    Lanza then turns to the question of consciousness, and what looks to be reality. He (page 36) writes: \\"Some may imagine that there are two worlds, one out there and a separate one being cognized inside the skull. But the two worlds model is a myth. Nothing is perceived except the perceptions themselves, and nothing exists outside of consciousness. Only one visual reality is extant, and there it is. Right there. The outside world is, therefore, located within the brain or mind. Of course, this is so astounding for many people, even if it is obvious to those who study the brain, that it becomes possible to over-think the issue and come up with attempted refutations.\\"    Lanza (page 38) notes Benjamin Libet`s famous timing experiment, where \\"unconscious, unfelt, brain electrical activity occrred a full half second before there was any conscious sense of decision-making by the subject,\\" and then Lanza misinterprets the results (in my view) by clinging to the classical notion of cause-and-effect. Lanza (page 39) writes: \\"What, then, do we make of all this? First, that we are truly free to enjoy the unfolding of life, including our own lives, unencumbered by the acquired, often guilt-ridden sense of control, and the obsessive need to avoid messing up. We can relax, because we`ll automatically perform anyway. \\" In other words, we are free because we are not free! And this tacit support for a one-sided cause-and-effect comes even as Lanzalater claims that time is an illusion and while he is found rejecting an irreversible and on-flowing continuum of events (where cause precedes effect)! Clearly, if cause-and-effect is declared real enough to interpret Libet`s findings, then time must also be real enough.    Nevertheless, Lanza does come to a correct conclusion in regard to Libet`s experiments. He (page 39) writes: \\"Modern knowledge of the brain shows that what appears out there is actually occurring within our own minds... Our external and internal perceptions are inextricably intertwined. They are different sides of the same coin and cannot be separated.\\"    Without saying it, Lanza is found endorsing a type of idealism (the belief that mind is fundamental), seemingly as extreme as George Berkeley`s idealism. It is this idealism that Lanza calls \\"biocentrism,\\"and it is the wellspring of life.    Lanza turns to quantum mechanics to support his view of idealism. He (page 49) writes: \\"When studying subatomic particles, the observer appears to alter and determine what is perceived. The presence and methodology of the experimenter is hopelessly entangled with whatever he is attempting to observe and what results he gets. An electron turns out to be both a particle and a wave, but how, and more importantly, where such a particle will be located remains dependent upon the very act of observation.\\"    Lanza explains the fine tuning of universal constants. He (page 90) writes: \\"If the universe is in a non-determined state until forced to resolve by an observer, and this non-determined state included the determination of the various fundamental constants, then the resolution would necessarily fall in such a way that allows for an observer, and therefore the constants would have to resolve in such a way as to allow life. Biocentrism therefore supports and builds upon John Wheeler`s conclusions about where quantum theory leads, and provides a solution to the anthropic problem that is unique and more reasonable than any alternative.\\"    After treating quantum theory and relativity theory, Lanza (page 106) asserts that time is an illusion: \\"That time is a fixed arrow is a human construction. That we live on the edge of all time is a fantasy. That there is an irreversible, on-flowing continuum of events linked to galaxies and suns and the Earth is an even greater fantasy. Space and time are forms of animal understanding - period. We carry them around with us like turtles with shells.\\"    To say that time is not well understood is one thing, but to assert that time is therefore an illusion seems unfounded to me. When forced to summarize his conclusion, he (page 111) backtracks from the bolder statements and writes only that: \\"Time does not have a real existence outside of animal-sense perception. It is the process by which we perceive changes in the universe.\\" I could add that time is real because mind and change are real.    Lanza treats space the same way he treats time. He (pages 112-113) writes: \\"... Space and time are neither physical nor fundamentally real. They are conceptual, which means that space and time are of a uniquely subjective nature. They are modes of interpretation and understanding. They are part of the mental logic of the animal organism, the software that molds sensations into multidimensional objects.\\"    Lanza (page 181) writes: \\"Sights, tactile experience, odors - all these sensations are experienced inside the mind alone. None are out there except by the convention of language. Everything we observe is the direct interaction of energy and mind. Anything that we do not observe directly exists only as potential - or more mathematically speaking - as a haze of probability.\\"    The danger is to over prescribe Lanza`s brand of idealism, while ignoring more generalized varieties like Hegel`s idealism, or the monistic idealism described in Amit Goswami's \\"The Self-Aware Universe.\\" The danger is to get caught up in word games, e.g., asserting that time andspace are illusions because they are in the mind and while claiming the primacy of mind that underwrites idealism thereby partly contradicting the assertion. One can start with idealism and then immediately fall into a solipsism that asserts that the only real mind out there is my own; all others being illusions with time and space. The distinction between \\"materialism\\" and \\"idealism\\" is equally troubling because ultimately mere definitions are secondary to what is intended and what is self-evident. It may be productive to skirt this distinction, and merge Lanza's idealism with a A.N. Whitehead`s panpsychism. Good references would be Christen de Quincey`s \\"Radical Nature,\\" and Henry P. Stapp`s \\"Mindful Universe.\\"    Lanza`s book is not a rigorous scientific treatment, but the science he refers to is rigorous. Neither is his book a comprehensive philosophical development. Rather, Lanza has a colloquial style that is typical of good popular books, and his book can be understood by non-experts. This is a very  important book for the right audience.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|This is a must have!!  The concert in DVD is awesome!!  Buy it!!
B002Q9VPFM|3.0|I wasn't able to see Watchmen in the theaters so I decided to wait to buy the movie until the uncut, Ultimate edition was released.  It was a long wait.  The problem is that the wait was not worth it and actually took away from the movie.  There is a lot of talk about the change to the ending.  I don't have a problem with it.  The main problem, however, is that the cartoon makes no sense in the new story line.  I know why it is there, but I try to engage into the world that the movie creates for me (like Batman) and not the source material.  When the movie shows you something that only makes sense in the context of the source material and makes NO sense outside of it, it is rather odd.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout dvd.  I consider myself a very fit individual.  I used to run daily, but for various reasons I can no longer excercise outdoors.  On top of that I have two little boys that take up all of my time so I really am short on time.  I was very hesitant about a 20 minute workout because most have you workout then rest and are half filled with stretching and taking your pulse.  This was a solid 20 minutes of kickin your butt and no rest.  I actually felt like I worked out - and worked out hard. I vary the levels and mix it up with my elliptical.  My only complaint (which I think was mentioned in other reviews) is there is a lot of talking and general stuff before you get to the main menu that you can't forward through.  If you are like me, and really in a time crunch, I recommend starting the dvd, then get changed into your clothes, get out your workout gear.  By that time the main menu will be up and you can start..

B000YRY8BG|5.0|It isn't often that something literally comes along and changes the standards of a viewer for an entire genre. By the time I got through the nearly six hour of State Of Play the first time around, that was exactly what had happened to me. Having watched it again in virtually one sitting I am once again surprised not only by how well the mini-series holds up during a second (or in my case fourth) viewing but just how high the quality of the mini-series really is.<br /><br />To begin with, the series features one essential element for any good story: good and believable characters played by fine actors. The cast of the series is top notch and is led by John Simm as newspaper reporter Cal McCaffrey and David Morrissey as British politician Stephen Collins who both give two incredibly gripping yet believable performances. While this is true of the entire series this fact is especially true during the final minutes of the series when things effectively become a two-hand play between Simm and Morrissey and their respective characters. It's easy to imagine how these characters could have been played differently but here, in this series, these performances are (to use words I don't sue very often) absolutely perfect.<br /><br />That's not to say that the rest of the cast is lacking by any means, far from it in fact. The supporting cast features fantastic performances that are just as gripping and believable as the performances of the mini-series two leads. The cast ranges Kelly Macdonald as reporter Della Smith, James McAvoy as reporter Dan Foster, Polly Walker as Coliins wife Anne, Stuart Goodwin as the mysterious Robert Bingham and the ever magnificent Bill Nighy as newspaper editor Cameron Foster. There is many more of course many others, but these are just a few of the fantastic performances to be found in State Of Play.<br /><br />There are also the production values to consider as well. One of the best things about State Of Play is the fact that one could believe that this could whole sequence of events is really just a headline away at any moment. Much of the credit of that goes to the production design of Donald Woods and the costumes of Claire Anderson both of which anchor the series firmly in reality. Then there's the incredible fly-on-the-wall cinematography by Chris Seager which manages not only to compliment the reality of the production design and costumes but gives the entire mini-series a documentary feel as well, all of which is helped by the editing of Mark Day. There's also the sparingly used, but highly effective, score by composer Nicholas Hooper which does what a good score is supposed to do: give additional emotional depth to any scene it appears in. All together the result is some of the strongest production values you're ever likely to see in a TV mini-series.<br /><br />The real success of the realistic feel of State Of Play lies not in how good the production values are but in the writing of scriptwriter Paul Abbott. Abbott has created a story that feels as though it could be ripped from tomorrow's headlines in a cautionary tale about the sometime fuzzy line between major corporations and those in government whoa re supposed to oversee them, in this case the corporation being a fictional but plausible British oil company and its lobbyists. The mini-series also takes a look at the modern news industry, how it gathers news, where it gets its information from and how pressure can be brought to bare if there's a story too damaging to those in high and powerful places. To do all this successfully and believably, Abbott forgoes many of the thriller clich&eacute;s of rather tired action sequences and instead (and rightfully in my humble opinion anyway) focuses on the characters and their dialogue which leads to close six hours of fantastic dialogue and an incredible plot. If anything makes State Of Play worth seeing it is the plot which sets a new standard in just how many twists and turns one can fit in a seemingly easily clich&eacute;d plot. The result is a complex a mini-series that leaves a first-time viewer ever seeking answers and those who've seen it before looking and finding new clues with every viewing. In short: it's a first class script without any doubt.<br /><br />So what is State Of Play? It is a fantastic thriller containing some truly fantastic yet believable performances, fine production values and a first-rate script that never sinks into clich&eacute;s. Yet it also something that is increasingly rare today. By doing all of those things it succeeds in doing something truly spectacular: it changes and raises the standards for an entire genre with it. If you can say nothing else you can say that State Of Play is what a good thriller ought to be.is a complex a mini-series that leaves a first-time viewer ever seeking answers and those who've seen it before looking and finding new clues with every viewing.

B002Q9MZF6|5.0|Shame, shame, shame on American distibutors for not releasing  this film theatrically in the US.  I would have killed to see this   on the big screen in full surround, et al.  Suffice to say,   this film captures a 'La Boheme' no Metropolitan Opera   satelitte simulcast ever could - meaning, it preserves   the performances of Netrebko and Villazon as, what are   likely to be, the definitive Mimi and Rodolfo. This is   as cinematic as any opera can get (and vice-versa!).

B0030Y11XS|5.0|This fantastic and emotional film is yet another masterpiece by the great film maker Michael Moore.  It is a scathing indictment of how our increasingly flawed Capitalist system is often used to line the pockets of special interests (including large banks), and how real Americans suffer as a by-product of this.  Lobbyists and special interests have hijacked Washington, and whored themselves to large corporations, and the twin political parties of Capitalism have blurred the lines and differences between them.  It seems that true Democracy is dying in America, and that it doesn't matter whether one votes for 'tweedledee' or 'tweedledum' (Repubs or Dems).  The rich are getting richer, job security (if you have a job to begin with) has fallen by the wayside, and our unsustainable healthcare system is derailing, with millions precluded from getting the care they need.  It seems like America's better years are behind us, and we need to do something about this before the quiet desperation of our middle classes becomes as apparent as that of our poor and forgotten in this country!

0061537969|5.0|I was blown away by this book.  For the first two paragraphs I thought that the narrator's point of view was a silly gimmick, but by the third paragraph it made perfect sense.  The central metaphor of race car driving as a representation of how a man controls his life was brilliant.  The plot alone is compelling, but the narrator and racing theme push this book to the head of the pack.  I could say more, but I'd rather let you experience it for yourself.  Highly recommended.
B00319ECHE|3.0|This album wasn't that impressive upon listening through it a couple times. The band replaced the guitarist Christian with Fear Factory's old guitarist Dino. The drummer Raymond who's a demigod of drumming in Demanufacture, Obsolete, and Archetype was replaced with Gene from Strapping Young Lad who just does generic blast beats. If the vocalist Burton thinks this is going to substitute for Raymond this is definitely not the case. Instead we have our generic lyrical content of the government system being corrupt like previous albums except no stories like Obsolete or Digimortal or Demanufacture. Instead Burton screams like generic metalcore and hardcore bands. This isn't Fear Factory and is just generic hashed up that will appeal to possibly new fans but anger older fans. The only decent tracks were \\"Powershifter\\" (Great Single) and \\"Final Exit\\". The bonus track \\"Crash Test\\" is a butchered wimpy screaming version of the original one on Soul of a New Machine (Solid album!). Although an improvement from Transgression it's nowhere near Archetype which can't touch Demanufacture. Someone knock some sense into Burton and bring back Raymond and Christian!     For fans wondering what Christian and Raymond have been working on they have two other bands called \\"Burn it All\\" and \\"Arkaea\\".

B0029LHX1W|3.0|This book has a great setup - a disgraced state security officer in Stalin's Soviet Union must catch a Serial Killer in a political environment in which crime officially doesn't exist. The horrific, paranoid atmosphere evoked by the historically accurate (I think) descriptions is truly frightening, and the main character's fall from grace is a great read.  The thriller plot delivers - up to a certain point. I'm not sure why the author felt he had to have a grand, 100% implausible \\"twist\\" in his story - it would have been a great read without it.  As it is, the book is chillingly suspenseful until about two thirds through, when everything simply becomes too unbelievable. Unfortunately, the resolution is absolute garbage and feels like the author tacked it onto the rest of the novel because he was in a hurry.    I'm not sure why it was nominated for so many prizes, or why Ridley Scott bought the rights to it - perhaps he wants to rewrite the ending?

0061120073|5.0|Betty Smith deftly depicts a young literate woman's perspective of Irish life in Brooklyn during the turn of the last century - impressively in a manner similar to great American authors Theodore Dreiser or Saul Bellow.  She shows us the great American story where simple roots can bring rise to good and sometimes great triumphs.<br /><br />Protagonist Francie Nolan is the main party throughout the book whose literary verve and gift make her the seemingly natural person to author this or a similar book.  She writes about the happy and sad times of poverty in Brooklyn when impoverished lives delivered grueling challenges.  But, to deliver such stories to the teacher in grade school can be straining.<br /><br />All great writers probably stretch the truth - that is what makes their stories surpass what we read or hear about on a daily basis. When Francie writes true stories about her poverty, her teacher says, \\"You know, Francie, a lot of people would think that these stories that you're making up all the time were terrible lies because they are not the truth as people see the truth.  In the future, when something comes up, you tell exactly how it happened but write down for yourself the way you think it should have happened. Tell the truth and write the story.\\"  She learns \\". . . poverty, starvation and drunkenness are ugly subjects to choose.  We all admit these things exist.  But one doesn't write about them.\\"<br /><br />But, Betty Smith did write about such difficult topics, and succeeded.  So have numerous others since.  Recently, [[ASIN:068484267X Angela's Ashes: A Memoir]] revolved exclusively about such Irish poverty forty years later. And how many post-war novels (WW I or WW II) have caught the public's attention with doom and despair as the almost exclusive focus of the fictional or nonfictional account?<br /><br />Reading books like this also allows modern readers to  learn about the times and events.  People walked outside late at night with little wonder about physical assault. Meals were \\"stretched out\\" from crumbs, day old bread, soups and parts of animals most of us would ignore. Education was very expensive, and horses ruled the roads in New York.  As the subway and car were still not fine-tooled enterprises, trips from Brooklyn to Manhattan were journeys. And, \\"When you get a Democrat president, you got a war president.\\" Times have changed.<br /><br />This book proudly has been selling for  decades, and could continue its selling feats beyond a century, because of the simplistic delivery and acute perception tied with great story and dialogue.

B0002XDODU|5.0|Rammstein was the first and is my favorite, Industrial Metal band that has been released from another country other than America. Rammstein's Sehnsucht was the first album I ever bought from them and mainly because of the internationally known 'Du Hast' song. Ever since then, whenever I am having a somewhat crappy day and I feel liking venting my frustration out through listening to the type of music that is related to how I feel, then I always listen to Rammstein. Then one day I heard the track, Amerika I knew that it had been awhile since I bought a new album from them and was very pleased to order Reise, Reise. Besides Amerika, I absolutely love cranking the volume to: Mein Teil (My Part) - Dalai Lama - Keine Lust (No Desire) - Los (Less) - Amerika (America) - Moskau (Moscow) - Morgenstern (Morning Star) - Stein Um Stein (Stone by Stone) - Adios (Goodbye) - Amour (Amour). Although not all the songs are as heavy as the songs from Sehnsucht, each track has more melodic symphony sounds, besides Mein Teil, which is all about Armin Meiwes a man found guilty in Germany for finding a willing person on the Internet to kill and then eat. And every step of the murder and cannibalism was video taped on a 2 hour tape which actually made some of the detectives seek dramatic therapy because the video was appallingly graphic.<br /><br />In closing, I absolutely love this album and the band Rammstein!

Now, I can see why the cinema owners didn't want to lose their shirts on this hideous misfire that might appeal to maybe one viewer--that would be the local newspaper movie critic who still thinks \\"Citizen Kane\\" is the greatest movie ever made.<br /><br />For one thing, unless you're Jewish, nearly 98 per cent of this movie makes zero sense. The \\"serious man\\"--played with infuriating vagueness by Michael Stuhlburg--is being divorced by his hideous slob of a wife who has the hots for another hideous man whose also Jewish. In other brainless scenes that no one can understand is the sub-plot of the brainless son who keeps running into his home from a bully. Oh, yes. There's the repeated plot line of him tellin his father that the TV aerial needs to be adjusted because favorite TV channels can't be seen.<br /><br />There are endless shots of someone putting a record needle on a 33 1/3 record to listen to Jewish music or instructions and then there are endless dream sequences where you FINALLY see something interesting and colorful but these end up with the serious man waking up in a sweat. Haven't we all seen this same worn-out device in countless horror flicks made on $1.99 budgets-which, come to think of, looks exactly like this idiotic travesty.<br /><br />We all know that \\"the serious man\\" is really a poor ole wimp because the Cohen Brothers dress him up in exactly the identical wardrobe of countless other wimps we see in horny teen adventures and modern tales of misfits--he wears his trousers too short with the cuffs almost halfway up his legs.<br /><br />As to the usual crtics who gave this exercise in idiocy 4 star raves, I do wish that for punishment they would be forced to sit in a room where the Coen Brothers Production of \\"A Serious Man\\" unreels non-stop around the clock.

0307588335|5.0|Lawrence McDonald's book, A Colossal Failure of Common Sense, was a captivating read.  I would recommend it to anyone.  At first I wasn't sure I would be able to follow it, since I have little understanding of the financial sector.  However, I was hooked before I even finished the prologue...and it just kept getting better.  Lawrence McDonald tells the story in a way that makes it not only understandable, but irresistible.<br /><br />As a former Lehman Brothers trader, McDonald tells the story from the inside out.  He walks us through the story giving us a close up perspective, and introducing us to the real players as the events unfold.  McDonald does an excellent job describing the characters, and along the way educating the everyday person on the financial elements, and ultimately explaining how and why the Lehman catastrophe happened.  Thank you Mr. McDonald for leaving me with the knowledge of a true story that I otherwise would not have been able to follow.<br /><br />I would not be surprised if this book is made into a movie.  It is that good!

I found myself pausing the picture throughout just to drool over the beauty.  This also includes the performers.  Not since MGM's heyday during the 30s have actors looked so ravishing--and this includes Bruce Willis when he's in his robot mode.<br /><br />Willis does an outstanding job throughout. Often, his face and body language convey his emotions and thoughts, evidence of a true and veteran movie performer.<br /><br />Equally as good as the photographey is the knock-out musical score of Richard Marvin.  His incessant usage of strings and woodwinds builds the excitement up to unnerving intensity. Should any studio be foolish enough to remake \\"Psycho\\" again, Marvin is definitely the composer they should turn to.<br /><br />This movie may have come and gone quickly in the multplex but you should enjoy this movie diversion that at least provides you with splendid eye candy and a knockout musical soore to give you goose-bumps.

0385523904|5.0|I heard about Nothing to Envy during an interview with the author on NPR. I don't have a huge budget for new books these days, but something about the story moved me to take a chance on this one. I am so glad I did! Barbara Demick has written a tour de force. Her meticulous reporting and elegant storytelling take us to a corner of the planet that is almost too strange to be believed. In North Korea, Orwell's 1984 is alive and well, with the added wrinkle of chronic food shortages. Her recounting of the country's 1990 famine moved me to tears and made me ashamed for the pettiness of my own life. Free market purists will love this book, but to me the story is larger than that. Just as I sometimes wonder what I would have done if I had been on a landing craft on D-Day, I wonder what I would do if our economic system collapsed. Demick provides a scarily vivid portrait of such a situation that leaves me praying I never have to face such horrors--and praying for those who continue to do so.

0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris discusses and substantiates extensively that Islam constitutes a totalitarian danger for modern civilization and that it is much more resistent to a tolerant interpretative change than other religions. Despising real life versus a glorious hereafter promised to the faithful is characterized as the core problem of islamic terrorism. Only thus we are able to understand why well-educated and privileged young people engage in suicidal terrorist attacks. So far, so little unusual - though presented in an extraordinary convincing manner. But Harris goes a refreshing step further: he attacks religious thinking as such. When we don't oppose islamic expansivity more convincingly, religious moderates have their share of the blame because their thinking contains the same (mis-)concepts: believing in the value of old \\"revealed\\" books as an authoritative orientation for todays world, acceptance of beliefs without convincing evidence or good reason. I absolutely agree with Harris on this point. To face religion with appeasement politics as done for example by our german philosopher Habermas is nothing more than a Zeitgeist way of political correctness. But what is Harris hoping for? Does he really expect that mankind might abandon her evolutionary and culturally deeply anchored tribalistic religiousity within short time under the menace of an expansive Islam? Radical criticism on religion is necessary. Harris provides a wealth of examples for negative influence of religious thinking on our western societies. But he overlooks that religious moderates are nevertheless our allies in preserving and promulgating liberal pluralistic societies. Furthermore Harris presents an ethical objectivism that seems somewhat illusionary to me. He expects a science of good and evil that will finally deliver results as convincing as those of physics. Harris' attack on an indifferentistically stained ethical relativism deserves sympathy. And no doubt reason can undermine morals based on ideological prejudice. But we shouldn't underestimate the element of decision which is inevitable even for the best informed and most rational moral agent. Unfortunately there is more than solidarity in our evolutionary and cultural legacy and even the benevolent finds himself confronted with moral dilemmas forcing him to choose. Harris' reflections on justifying torture of criminals in extreme cases are logically stringent but to shortsighted. U.S. ambivalence on this point in the aftermath of 9/11 teaches us that weakening the ban of torture encourages the sadists you have to expect in every army or security forces, brings discredit on democracy and deprives prisoners of their human and civil rights without producing the positive effects strived for. Despite of such weaknesses: Harris' book is definitely worth reading. He bashes to all sides according to what consequence of thinking demands. But far from adhering to criticism alone he offers a sketch for a positive humanist approach to life.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Excellent album, nice variety of songs and the voice of Susan Boyle is unbelievable.  This was one of the best Christmas gifts we received.
038541627X|3.0|most of the stories are too far out. there is good imagination, however his writing is not up to literary standards. I thought his stories would be based upon events or possibilies that might occur in the future- The stories about space travel were ok. this book is barely ok.
0061537969|5.0|Im a 29 years old pretty tough bodybuilder but still, I couldn't finish this book.   Amazing read , very well written in a light delicious language .   Originally Im from Israel , currently residing in Los Angeles , CA. I called a bookstore there and ordered two copies for my sister and my cousin's wife.  Same thing with my aunt in Boston.  I know they will love it as much as I did. One part will definitely break your heart and have you wet the book pages. Seriously.  And if you currently have a dog , you will just hug and appreciate them even more.
0385340575|5.0|I have always loved Lee Childs novels and GONE TOMORROW is no excepotion.    I sure hope he is able to find a TV producer and the appropriate actor to do a TV series.    Amazon's service is great also!
1401207529|5.0|I recommend this book to all fans(who probably already have it) and to anyone just starting to read comics and interested in Batman.  Frank Miller made three characters really standout in this novel.  Batman who gives us the beginning of a dark figure fighting for justice in a cruel jungle of steel and cement.  Gordon the first white knight to bring hope to a city that has lost it.  And last the the city itself, Gotham.  This city is dark, rotten, evil to the core.  The only thing it could do was get help.  This is a really amazing story and not one to miss.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|This is sure to create an entire new generation of StarTrek fans.  The cinematography and acting were superb.  The characters felt more real and human than in the other movies.  You could relate to their feelings and friendships.  The sets and locations are by far more realistic than the original series. While I love the original I recommend this movie wholeheartedly. I love it.
B002NPUCP8|1.0|According to a video interview in the March issue CD of Guitar World magazine her roots are in the Blues. She also demonstrates her considerable skills during that video. If all of you slaves to mediocrity had seen that video before hearing this album you would have rated it MUCH differently. Unless you like musical pablum of course. In which case you know nothing about guitar and Orianthi is a very talented guitar player.<br /><br />There is already enough garbage nondescript pop music to sink the Titanic. Adding this to the pile of sonic manure is a disgrace for this promising young musician. Whoever is responsible for it needs to be looking for a job outside the music business because things don't work like they used to anymore. Though one must conclude that she had SOMETHING to say about making this record. I feel sad for Orianthi if she has to tour to support this and I am seriously concerned about the type of fan base this album will attract. Certainly not the kind of people who can appreciate her formidable talents. Let's hope she finds an intelligent manager soon. I would suggest that she get in touch with follow Aussie Tal Wilkenfeld, who seems to be doing it right.<br /><br />Clearly, the only piece on this album that gets anywhere close to showing off her skills is *Highly Strung*. If it's true that Steve has taken her on as a prot&eacute;g&eacute;, I hope he helps her steer her career in the right direction. One that will highlight her guitar playing. Otherwise she wouldn't be the first great talent to disappear.
B001B51B9M|5.0|...They really get it right.  Such is the case with the filmed version of \\"The Music Man\\".  This film is simply irresistable!  The music, the performances -all first rate and perfect casting throughout, the gorgeous color cinematography, the costumes, the production design.  I could go on and on.  If you've never seen this film or only seen it in pan and scan television broadcasts, you owe it to yourself to see this gem!  Everyone agrees that Robert Preston was born to play this part.  LIke Rex Harrison in \\"My Fair Lady\\", it is difficult to imagine anyone else in the role.  Shirley Jones is absolutely stunning!  She has never looked lovelier.  Her voice is a miracle.  I place her voice in the top five greatest female voices of all time.  Wonderful film!
0375413405|5.0|Obviously, the recipes in this book taste wonderful!  I made the Cassoulet De Porc De  Mouton except I didn't use lamb as was called for but used more pork instead. The taste was wonderful and the recipe was enough to feed over 15 people.  The recipe covered four pages not including having to go back in the book to know how to fix the pork.  I read through the instructions more than once to make sure I was following the instructions correctly.  I loved the outcome BUT it is not for someone new to cooking!!!
B002LE8EFQ|5.0|Susan Boyle's story is one that speaks alot to our aspirations for finding the best part of ourselves and sharing it with others. Her music is exquisitely orchestrated, her melodies simply purely lyrical. I will enjoy this cd for many years to come and look forward to more works from this elegant yet feisty lady of our hearts.    Sara JW

0061876747|4.0|William Boyd's Ordinary Thunderstorms starts well. A chance meeting in a restaurant leads Adam Kindred, a young academic in London for a job interview, to the scene of a murder. His DNA on the weapon and his accidental possession of certain information means he's being sought by both the authorities and the killer, so Adam does the only thing he can think of: he goes off the grid and starts playing a waiting game. What follows isn't quite the story this tense beginning led me to expect. It might have been an action-packed, edge-of-your-seat kind of read, the hero surviving by stealth, slipping away from his would-be captors via fast cars or daring feats. Instead, Boyd offers a less exciting but presumably more realistic story about how someone in Adam's position could manage to evade capture while building a new life from scratch. The stories of a number of other characters whose paths intersect with Adam's are also told: Rita, a policewoman with the marine unit, a CEO who, in a nice touch, has a penchant for not wearing underpants, the killer.<br /><br />The book is not always gripping, but I like that Adam's story of life on the run seems realistic. I'm tempted to say that the book is put together well, in that the various stories do finally meet up and things make sense, but upon finishing it I realized there were some threads which seemed not to fit into the book as a whole. It's not that I want absolutely everything neatly packed away at the end, but I was left wondering what the point of large swaths of the story were, enough that I triple checked the cover copy to see if there's any indication that we're to expect a sequel: Nothing obvious, and I wouldn't think the story would really lend itself to a part two. Kindred isn't a particularly admirable character, or fascinating because of quirks or extreme intelligence or anything of that sort. I believe him as a character, but I probably won't remember him.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamel
0307702103|5.0|John Grisham narrates his own audio in FORD COUNTRY: STORIES, his first collection of his short stories, centered around Ford Country Mississippi - the setting of his first novel A TIME TO KILL. From family ties to a miracle phone call and an ambitious career, this varied collection provides a diverse cast of characters with a satisfyingly realistic Southern flavor to each tale.
1400106338|3.0|I like that it fills in some of the spots you wonder about when reading the original...but, whew, it does go on at times. I find I keep hitting the seek button. The woman reading has a great voice and I enjoy listening to her.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Lived up to all of the hype. I am not in great shape and the Level 1 kicked my butt! I can't wait to get to Level 2 and 3. This provides such a great, well-rounded work out with cardio, weights, and abs.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|My daughter is almost 4, and loves Beanie Babies, and Spongebob.  This was a fun addition to her collection, and she loves to play with this. I also bought the Spongebob Beanie, and she has already made her own Bikini Bottom. Very durable, as it gets played with daily.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|Saw this movie on Masterpiece Theater and then saw another version that someone posted on You Tube.  Noticed that they cut a whole scene out on the one televised on TV.  Looked up the original running time posted on IMDB and noticed it said that this movie ran for 240 minutes.  But noticed that the one being sold on Amazon is only 229 minutes.  So I have a feeling that the one being sold here will be the version that cuts out that scene.  Why do movies that were originally released in the UK always have to be edited down? That would probably be my only complaint.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|This is an excellent piece of work, so far my favorite is \\"The Moon and Sky.\\"  Listen to these tracks in the following order and you get a short story, Long Hard Road, Bring Me Home, The Safest Place, and Soldier of Love. Sade, Andrew, Stuart, and Paul have presented the world with beautiful music and poetic lyrics that touch the soul.
B002ZMZBD2|2.0|The CD promises a 5.1 Surround Sound download. The provided download is not 5.1 at all; it's 2-channel WAVs, which you are encouraged to play under Dolby PL II, just as you can with any CD. I think this constitutes false advertising.
B002LE8EFQ|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my 85 yr old mother....she claims that she might wear it out playing it.   She just recently lost a friend in England who was also a Boyle fan.   I think that this CD will comfort her for a long time.   Sometimes we find our security in odd places.     the service at Amazon was great.
B002LLE3PY|4.0|Lizard is a challenging King Crimson album. However the new mix created by Steven Wilson has brought it back to life and is now a more enjoyable album that has also considerable sound quality improvement especially in 5.1 mix.<br />The track that includes Yes Jon Anderson is very enjoyable. The booklet is a great read with Fripp even having doubts but is very happy himself with the new mixes.<br /><br />Overall this is not one of the best King Crimson albums but is a worthy addition if you want to build up your prog collection and enjoy the excellent Steven Wilson 5.1 mix on DVD.
B000SX89ZM|2.0|I've been trying to listen to this album since it was released in '84 but I can't really stand the album and I love Duran Duran. Most of the songs are crap. There is only 2 songs really worth listening to and that's The Reflex and Union of the Snake. Buy the greatest hits or Strange Behaviour import with extended remixes of all their greatest hits and then some.
0307454541|4.0|Not a bad read, if you like complicated plots and long Swedish names.  I never would have figured out the ending. Also the main character (Salander) is really quite different and fascinating.
B000002L68|5.0|If you haven't figured it out: this is a classic album. I'm STILL listening to the album 24 years later. I just wish he would remaster the album but one thing I've noticed is that Prince doesn't look back. That's why he's never remastered any of his music. If you've heard all the songs, I recommend that you track down the extended versions of some of the songs. The dance version of Let's Go Crazy is on Ultimate Prince but the others are harder to come by. There is also an extended versions of The Beautiful Ones, Computer Blue and Darling Nikki. All worth hearing. You will see the master at his finest and know why this album is awesome.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Received my order very quickly and was quite pleased with the DVD.  Would highly recommend purchasing from this buyer in the future!!  Thank You!
B001F12J48|3.0|I was disappointed in the 3-D effects in this movie. Even with the glasses there was hardly any difference. The story is great, but the 3-D effects aren't.
B002CJZ8TA|5.0|I LOVE the increasingly available range of book titles in foreign languages!!! I'm studying French right now and everyone who has studied a foreign language knows how mindlessly boring it is to study, yet again, \\"This is a book,\\" a phrase I don't think I've ever used in English.<br /><br />My instructor is flexible and is willing to let me read what interests me and what interests me are classic books, especially reading them in their original language.  Of course, it isn't easy and I ask my professor too many questions, but thankfully, I can email them so as not to annoy other students.  This wouldn't lend itself to a classroom study, but my course is online.<br /><br />This is a great book and its even more wonderful now that its so easily accessible, searchable in English, since my French is so bad that if I had to search for it in French, I'd likely never find it.
0143038583|5.0|Perhaps one the most thought-provoking reads in decades... you'll find it virtually impossible to think of food the same way again.  Michael Pollan has written a gem.  The Omnivore's Dilemma takes us on a fascinating journey of discovery that visits every link in the modern American food chain and opens our eyes wide to the wonder of what it truly means to be an `omnivore' in today's over-processed and shrink-wrapped jungle.  He places the essential act of eating in the moving context of a relationship - between you the eater and those responsible for the production and preparation of that which you eat.  And that relationship extends to the very plants and animals that constitute the basis of the human food chain.  Written in a witty and engaging style, Pollan teaches us an important lesson on the very essence of humanity and underscores the challenge we face as slowly evolving biological creatures immersed in a rapidly advancing industrialized civilization.
0786891084|3.0|A series of emails, letters, and other correspondences make up the narrative of this book. Its not an entirely novel idea (no pun intended) but one that works even in this case. However, I think the book could have been shortened quite a bit (the whole divorced chat room scenario seemed irrelevant to the overall plot). About 3/4ths through it, I found myself skipping large chunks just to get to the end.     Rosie and Alex seemed destined to make mistake after mistake when it comes to love and life -- though it bothered me that Alex is considerably more financially successful.     When I did finally finish it, I felt a bit melancholy. I think the ending was supposed to be happy and make people believe in the power of love. But the proceeding chapters were so full of sadness, bad choices and even death that it left me feeling letdown.    Overall, its a meandering and depressing love story.
B00319ECC4|5.0|I picked up this new FF album the day it came out.  Since 95 I have been a huge fan of this band.  I have to say it is a strong, robust, \\"mechanical\\" creation.  Every song rocks, and is full of raw power.  Thats what this band is.  Having Dino back you can hear it in the \\"emotion\\" of the songs.  Transgression was garbage, and this is a great album......I love it, and keep them coming!
B000077VR3|5.0|It's Paris in 1899. Christian, a young English poet, comes to Paris to pursue a penniless career as a writer. However, he soon meets a group of Bohemians who tell him that he should write a musical show for them to be performed at the Moulin Rouge, the most famous underworld night club in Paris. The night they arrive at the Moulin Rouge, Christian meets Satine, the club's star and a beautiful courtesan. He falls head-over-heels in love with her and though it takes a bit of convincing, she falls for him as well. Meanwhile, the club's owner, Harold Zidler, invests in a wealthy Duke to help pay for the club, however, the Duke will only pay if Satine is his. This crazy love triangle twists and turns. And little does Satine know that she has a deadly secret that could end everything. Visually it is superb, an indulgent feast for the eyes with every breathtaking, artistic scene. Everything about it is over the top, every scene more stunning than the next, and as it continues, your heart becomes more and more intertwined in the love story. It pushes against the confines of convention and leaves you breathless. A stunning, visual feast.
B001U887LU|4.0|I bought matching crocs for both my husband and myself and we love them. We wear them everyday as they are very comfortable. The only problem we have with the shoes is the lining comes out when we take them off. Not a big deal for us.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|A young boy falls in love with a girl that is way above his social standards along with the art of magic. Although the parents forbid them of seeing each other they cannot be split apart. Until one day they were found together and the boy was sent off. He became a magician and traveled the world. She fell in love with another man, the Crown Prince. The two got engaged but the boy, Eisenheim, finally meets back up with the girl and uses his powers to free her from the royal house in Vienna. This movie is stunning in many aspects. Visually in terms of locations, inside and out, there was great consistency and a nothing seemed strained. The story weaved fluidly through these locations and seemed to make the locales a vital part of the story. Ed Norton and Jessica Biel are superb. The story is fresh and imaginative, very intriguing. Highly recommended.
0805091742|4.0|Atul Gawande's book on clinical checklists is excellent and highly recommended. This book is an overview of the provenance and history of checklists and how he's implemented them in clinical settings around the world. It includes some information on traps and pitfalls to avoid when designing checklists, the need for brevity, and some of the political considerations (in the sense of office politics). I think he stumbles slightly when talking about \\"checklists\\" used by general contractors who build skyscrapers. Those are more accurately described as project plans, which are comprehensive, time-ordered, resourced, applied against calendars months or years long, with built-in dependencies and so on. As one of the most important design factors for good checklists is brevity and the refusal to be comprehensive, I'm not sure the skyscraper example is a good one.    I appreciate this book's brevity, which given its subject matter shouldn't be surprising. But as a follow-up, I'm hoping Gawande writes a practical guide to implementing checklists. Preferably in checklist form.    Gawande is a great writer - unadorned, humble, precise, to the point. I'm a big fan of his writing in the New Yorker. He's doing his country and his profession a huge service here.
B00005JL2O|5.0|Dr. Evil and Mini-Me have somehow escaped from a maximum security prison and the duo team up with Goldmember. Together they formulate a plan for world domination. And this particular scheme requires a large amount of time-travel, and kidnapping Austin Powers' father, England's master spy, Nigel Powers. As Austin chases Dr. Evil, Mini-Me and Goldmember through time, he stops in 1975 to \\"connect\\" with an old girlfriend, detective Foxxy Cleopatra, and requests her help to track the villains and save his father. I recommend you see this one. I found this movie hilarious and outrageous, with a lot of crude humor. Watch this movie if you love Austin Powers as there is plenty of energy.

B000ETQR3Q|4.0|This nerf gun is awesome, I also bought the Vulcan for myself and my son Christian.  My other children have this gone and one other.  It sounds crazy but it gives me the opportunity to have fun playing with my kids indoors when snowing out and outdoors when it's nice.  Great product and it's durable.  Believe me, my kids are 5,6, and 8.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Woo hoo! I had read all of the books, but I did not have HBO, and I really felt I needed to see this show, so I got the videos and powerwatched all of them over 3 days (I did have to sleep and work)<br />At first, I'll admit, I was a bit shocked (having never seen an HBO series) at the raw sex scenes, but, fortunately, I could easily avert my eyes.<br />I'd rather have seen the show on HBO, but this was cheaper than ordering HBO, and it got me ready for the second season, when I did subscribe.<br />TrueBlood the series is not for the faint of heart, or people who don't want to watch other people having sex.
B0001VWP8I|4.0|I bought this CD, less than 1/2 what i would have paid elsewhere.  The CD, and songs are great.  While it took a little longer than expected to arrive, had no problems -- and can't beat the price.   If you're Anastacia Fan, great CD.
B0031MA7RA|2.0|I was expecting a little bit more science, and a little less \\"we are the world.\\" I appreciate that Taylor's experience has made her value life and her experiences, but it felt too personal to be applied to my life and too self-help to be interesting as a memoir.

B001992NUQ|5.0|This is my first blu-ray purchase and probably the best.  I've never seen this movie before and I have to say, I finally know what the hype is all about.  I'm not gonna spoil the movie for anyone...but just understand that the movie is intense and simply awesome.  Get it and see for yourself.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I have always been a fan of Whitney Houstons and was excited when she came out with a new album. Normally when you purchase a cd their may be a couple songs you don't like, this instance i've enjoyed each one. All I can say is \\"Welcome Back\\" this fan missed your music
B00005JPUN|5.0|I forgot I had already seen this, but it was great watching it the SECOND time around! If you're into Sci-Fy, Mystery, and Mild Horror, then The Invasion is definitely the movie for you! Enjoy...
B002YIHO7I|1.0|I'm a big fan of Sade. Not over the top, but have all her albums, and a dvd. I always look forward to her albums because I know they'll be unique, have fresh rhythms, heart-felt lyrics, etc...Unfortunately this album has none of those things.   Soldier of love was already addressed by Donnie Osmond in the late 80's. \\"Bring Me Home\\" borrows from Sugar Ray's \\"Someday\\" too much, but is hardly the catchy great tune that was.  If you wanna know what sitting down with a drum machine and a guitar while wasting a great, legendary, voice with tried lyrics sounds like, buy this album. Or buy mine in the used market.   Severely let down.
B001JV5BIA|1.0|This movie is about two girls who are raped and murdered.  Yet the music is a combination of Looney tunes, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and corny ballad-type sounds that are all entirely out of place.  If it was thought that the contrast would make it more horrible, the thought was a big mistake because it backfires.  Add to this a sheriff Andy and deputy Fife who are joking around right down to the Skipper-hitting-Gilligan-with-the-hat routine, and the result is a silly flick instead of something that should have been horrible and riveting.  One can only wonder what the fools who slapped this thing together were thinking.  Comic relief and plenty of it absolutely ruined the story.  This is perhaps the most poorly crafted video I have ever seen.  What should have been frightening fell flat on its face.  Perhaps those who made it just didn't have the guts to make something really horrible when it came down to business because their own stomachs were weaker than those in the audience.  The same goes for The Hills Have Eyes with its ridiculously improbable rescues of the victims when we all know in reality they would have been slaughtered.
1400052173|5.0|what is fair for all? is it taking a specimen from a patient, never letting them know or is it justified in the name of science? this book is so engrossing, makes you think what if it had been my mom, sister, cousin,etc. these folks were shunted aside so science could get on with their programs, make money and yes maybe cure some. but, it is so wrong to exploit those just because you can. my heart aches for her family, how i think it could have been different had she been white. i am gladdened by this author's humanity; you do not often see it with a book of this kind. it is just factual, nothing personal about these people who lived, suffered,work day after day, then died without anyone knowing a contribution had been made, but with no compensation so that the remaining family basically had no resources. i will read this book again and again.

B002VECMAO|5.0|This movie is a must-see, even if you like it or not, in the end it has a very good message, it is an excellent movie regardless of other commentaries i've read here.    I recommend this movie just like i would: K-pax, Donnie Darko, Gladiator, and others.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|There's not really much to say as it's just an HDMI cable, bought to replace a damaged one.  Went to the local stores and got sick looking at the prices.   Checked out Amazon and gave this one a shot.   No issues whatsoever.  I then took the opportunity to order 3 more to replace the rest of my cables.  (they are all about 4 years old and bought for significantly more).    I would recommend these to anyone!
1591843162|5.0|I never thought I'd be drawn in by an author people refer to as a \\"marketing guru,\\" but here I am.  I'm a professional singer/songwriter and saw Mr. Godin's book, Tribes, on someone's bookshelf in Nashville, TN.  I think I read it in a couple of days and then signed up for his daily blog.      Linchpin...I eagerly awaited its arrival and was not disappointed.  Mr. Godin speaks volumes of truth, simultaneously common sense and radically upside-down from popular thought.  He says what we all need to hear and would have benefited from hearing long ago, before we got bogged down in the \\"system\\" of showing up, following instructions and timidly keeping original thoughts and questions to ourselves.      Points that most resonated with me:    ...The notion that we can CHOOSE to be artists...as soon as I read his thoughts on this, I began discovering artists everywhere.  Not only the ones like me creating music, or like my sister, creating paintings...but cruise stewards and poured themselves out with great generosity and joy, a babysitter who cherishes the children and values her contribution to their lives, a financial planner who goes above and beyond to encourage and speak wise counsel to his clients--even if it costs him a profit...the list goes on and on.      ...The idea that the more we give, the more we become and the more we and our art flourish.  Generosity is an essential element in true and complete artmaking.    ...The reminder that not all art is commercially marketable at a given point in time...and it's worth considering whether we might diminish the very substance of the art by attempting to make it so.      There is just so much good and worthwhile--and fresh--in this provocative book, that I probably annoyed everyone around me by reading portions aloud and referencing it at every turn.  :)      Thank you, Mr. Godin, for encouraging and inspiring us to fear less in order to become more.

B001OQCV6A|4.0|This fun re-imagined version of Sherlock Holmes, has Robert Downey Jr. as the famous fictional Detective and Jude Law as his partner Watson. When one of his nemesis' Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) is captured and hung, evidence proves that he may be back from the dead.<br /><br />  Before being hung, Blackwood warns Holmes that people will die and that there's no way he can stop it. While a former love interest and nemesis (Rachel McAdams) is one of the people targeted. Can Holmes save the girl and solve the case ?<br /><br />  The movie isn't exactly everything I hoped for from a Sherlock Holmes movie. He doesn't only use his brain to solve the case but brawn and bullets as well. Which isn't anything like the original stories. From the trailers I really expected to loath this movie and the approach that was taken with it. However, Guy Ritchie didn't really hack up the story as much as I expected. The trailer that showed non-stop action and Holmes doing Pit Fighting made me think otherwise. The movie is more interesting than I expected and you still have a good Detective film, even if yes there is a lot of fighting and explosions. I think Sherlock Holmes is Guy Ritchie's best film actually and I hope to see sequels.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli have brought man timeless classics to animated film. His stories always reach the hearts of viewers and the imagination, musical score and characters are some of the best in animation. Miyazaki uses very human-like movements in his animation. In addition, much of the art is done using water colors. These stories offer heart felt compassion, strong moral values and a sense of respect towards nature and man.<br /><br />Nausicaa is among my all time favorites of Miyazaki's films.<br />The Main protagonist, Nausicaa is a young and fun-loving princess of the serene Valley of the Wind. Viewed by her followers as charismatic and peaceful, she is adored by all. With an uncanny ability to communicate with the giant insects that thrive in the forest around the village. The Forest has been stained with poison, which infested the plant-life and takes to the wind in the form of spores. The guardian of this Poisonous Forest is the Ohmu, a larger than life armored caterpillar-like insect. The Insects come in many shapes and sizes with the Ohm being the most feared and revered amongst them. The insects are able to communicate with each other and sense threats in the forest. When the insects become filled with rage their eyes glow red, and when returned to a state of calm they radiate blue. Thanks to Nausicaa's persistent visits to the Poisonous Forest to gather supplies and research the toxic nature of the valley she calls home. The inhabitants of the valley have become accustomed to living with the insects and forest. Nausicca is an adept fighter taught by Lord Yupa a wondering samurai style character. Who mentors her in fighting skills and wisdom. Nausicca takes to the air on a glider with jet proficiency. Her ability in \\"Wind-riding\\" serves her well in her exploits and offers a peaceful get away from the hustle and bustle of valley life.<br />  But when an airship crashes into the valley things begin to take a turn for the worst. Nausicaa rushes to the wreckage to find a young girl shackled to the burning airship. The young girl turns out to be a Princess from another kingdom, who warns her that the cargo of the plane must be destroyed. The cargo, a \\"Giant Warrior\\". An ancient evil created in a time of war. When a form of Military intervenes and tries to rid the forest of the poison and insects alike, the valleys wise woman Obaba warns that doing so will anger the Ohmu and a catastrophe will follow. The people of the Valley of the Wind are in for tough times and Nausicca leads the way to peace.<br />Legends tale of a fabled man in blue, that will appear surrounded by a sea of gold and reunite the people of the valley with the nature that surrounds them.<br /><br />I highly recommend films by Hayao Miyazaki. The are amazing works of art, with meaningful messages and wonderful characters.to find a young girl shackled to the burning airship.

B002YIHO7I|2.0|What happened to Sade? The first four cd's were classics and Lover's Rock was solid as well but not classic material. The 10 year layoff really shows with this latest cd. Missing is percussion sounds, horns, strings and syth sounds; as a result, the the music does not sound full. However, the relentless acoustic guitar seems to be present in every song. There is very little soul present throughout the entire cd. This is more like a combo country and soft rock cd than r&b. Also, it would have been nice to have a guest appearance on the cd to give it an element of surprise. I would have loved to have heard India Arie and Sade on the same track. Overall, this is by far the worse cd by the group Sade. I must say that I have become a fan of other artists such as Jill Scott, India Arie, Lalah Hathaway, Eric Roberson, and Dwele during Sade's 10 year absence from the music scene. I will always enjoy the classic Sade cd's but this one is going to collect some dust.
B001ANOU7U|4.0|I saw this picture some years ago but bought it recently when I was looking for a resource to use as a source of discussion and inspiration for a group of school principals on Retreat. My review, therefore, is going to have a spiritual squint to it. In the end, I chose to use another movie but loved renewing my acquaintance with the improbable cast of characters at the Bagdad Cafe.      Some viewers will find this picture slow and even repetitive. As one of my students at school would say, \\"How can you watch a movie in which there are no car chases and on one takes off their pants!\\" What it loses in kinetic oomph, however, Baghdad Cafe makes up for in whimsy, charm and shrewd insight into human nature. The casting is  inspired. CCH Pounder plays the febrile, desperately unhappy Brenda running the Cafe in the desert;  Marianne Sagebrecht is perfect as Jasmin, the frumpy German tourist dumped on the highway who walks into the cafe and brings the lost souls washed up there to life. Jack Palance plays an aging Hollywood screen painter who lives in a trailer and who finds his muse in the unlikely Jasmin.     This is a deeply spiritual story. In a sense it is a retelling of Ezekiel's vision of the valley of dry bones. The lifeless bones of the broken spirits of the Cafe take flesh and grow again. There are hints of the Gospel stories of resurrection and cleansing from demon possession. Each of the characters grows and changes for the good. We see reconciliation and the cardinal values promised by Saint Paul: Faith, Love and [especially] Hope.  The feel good ending is not quite satisfying but the whole movie has that beautiful feeling that makes a picture like Casablanca so rich: these are characters coming to the good. It's great to be able to watch a film that makes you proud to be human being instead of ashamed.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Emotional, profound movie on the sacrifice of my Lord and Savior!  May not be what some were expecting, but of those that knew Jesus firsthand, followed Him didn't expect Him to be treated so maliciously either even though they were told what was about to happen.  The BEST part of the movie is NOT the cross (however that is beautiful all in itself that He loves us that much) but the RESURRECTION!  Why is it not possible for all to see the love that was poured into a people (ALL) that is so undeserving of God's grace.  For the ones that wrote derogatory statements it is sad that they have to condemn someone for their beliefs but are the first to jump on the bandwagon to express theirs so offensively.  You honestly shouldn't miss this film!!Remember your hate filled comments when your knee bows and your tongues confess!!!  God is love, not hate, not anger...God is LOVE!!!

031606792X|3.0|I read twilight, new moon, and eclipse. Those three books were so addicting and exciting. I got lost in my own imaginary, romantic world. I felt like a teenager all over again. So of course I couldn't wait to read Breaking Dawn. As soon as I finished reading eclipse, I rushed over to the nearest library to check-out Breaking Dawn. I began reading it that same day. I was pleased until Bellas' and Edward's honeymoon.     The following are the things I hated about the book:    - The honeymoon sex: The main reason Bella agreed to marry Edward was because they were going to consummate their love, a human experience Bella didn't want to miss out on before she became a vampire. She brought it up a couple of times. It was a big deal, so I expected Stephanie Meyer to provide us with some details during. Instead, she wrote about the morning after. I know this book is targeted to teenagers; therefore, I didn't expect graphic details but she could have handled it a different way. I hate how she went around the topic as if sex is still considered taboo. I was not satisfied.     -The pregnancy: Bella got pregnant and had the baby like three months after, or something like that. Nothing about the pregnancy was normal, which is fine because this is all make believe anyway. Why did she have to get pregnant though? This part of the book was ridiculous, and I felt like it was an entirely different book. It felt more like Rosemarys baby. It was so disturbing and bellas character became annoying. I actually wanted her to die. She didn't die and she gets her happy ending. Bella as a mother is not convincing nor is Edward as a father.     -Jacob imprints on Bellas kid (Renesmee): I loved Jacob's character in this book so it infuriated me that he ends up imprinting on the baby. He deserved better than that. He could have imprinted on Leah. All signs were pointing towards that. I know the relationship is that like of a mother and child but I still found it disturbing. The baby is half vampire and half human and will reach adulthood in a couple of years, so I guess that works out for him. I think Meyer will actually write about about how their relationship develops.     -Bella as a vampire: Bella does not only get a child and beauty, but she skips the phase that all vampire newborns go through. She has self-control and never hurts a human being. The only person she hurts is Jacob, only because he calls her baby \\"Nessie\\" instead of Renesmee. I wanted her to slip. Wanted her to snap at Rosalie. Maybe even kill her.    -The fight with the Volturi doesn't happen: Meyer hypes the situation between the Volturi and the Cullens. Through many chapters, the Cullens spend time preparing for the fight, a fight that doesn't even end up happening. A lot of talking happens. No action. I got bored. I wanted the fight to happen. Wanted the cullens to destroy the Volturi.     I didn't mind the happily ever after, just the events leading up to it. The only thing that kept me sane was Jacob. His character was so funny. It would be interesting if Meyer does decide to write about a book about Jacob and Renesmee. If she does, and does a good job, then maybe I wouldn't be so mad at the whole pregnancy thing.
B001EN71DQ|1.0|I have long hated the Prequels and their painful acting, blunt plot, and ape-like storytelling, UNTIL... I found them perfectly realized in a new form.    Lego Star Wars (Part I - Prequels) is a fun game.  It tells the story of these prequel without the heavy-handed, fake drama.  Let's be honest: These are movies about explosions and ninjas with laser swords.  Shakespeare it ain't.  The Lego game fulfills all that the Prequels were meant to be: Light on plot, heavy on collecting action figures.    Do yourself a favor: Don't burn forty bucks and 6 (plus) hours of your life slogging through these movies.  Buy [[ASIN:B000R39GGE Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga]] for less money and more fun.  That item, you'll go back to... these movies, they'll just collect dust.

B002QXI2L8|5.0|Dance (in bare feet) overshadows the singing in this production of the operatic masterpiece by Christoph W. Gluck premiered in 1762. His goal was \\"noble simplicity\\" and he concluded with a happy scene in which Amor revivified dead Orpheus and twice-dead Eurydike to resume their love. This production, however, respects their death.<br /><br />The three principal roles are movingly danced and sung by Yann Bridard & Maria Riccarda Wesseling (Orpheus), Marie-Agnes Gillot & Julia Kleiter (Eurydike), and Miteki Kudo & Sunhae Im (Amor). The singers appear onstage and remain in character. Orpheus appears throughout, and Eurydike dances in the last two scenes. Most dramatic are the emotionally charged corps and chorus. The costumes designed by Bausch's romantic partner Rolf Borzik (died 1980) for the 1975 premiere are marvels of fluidity (thanks of course to execution by the current costume department). The excellent filming and editing was overseen by Vincent Bataillon.<br /><br />THE SCENES<br /><br />(1) Introduction & (2) Grief. At audience-left in a high chair is Eurydike (?) in a white shroud/wedding dress, blood red roses in her lap, looking down passively on her burial site. Black-garbed mourners, more women than men, cringe and twist beneath a black sky, in strict adherence to musical beat. Their arms and hands are in relentless motion, outdancing their feet. At audience-right, Orpheus, in \\"nude\\" briefs, stands rigid, before a brown uprooted cedar skeleton. Then he lies face down before a great laurel wreath. The mourners file off, and he rises to dance an agonized solo as he beseeches the gods to return his dead loved one. Thus appears Amor, who tells him he can invade the Underworld and reclaim Eurydike but must not look into her face. [Here, as well as in Scene 3, Ms Bausch is remarkably creative in distributing her dancers over the width and depth of the stage and animating the subgroups with different activities.]<br /><br />(3) Violence. In the anteroom to hell three leather aproned men alarm the denizens, some in winding sheets. The music is demonic. Orpheus enters. One woman carries a yarn basket, and white skeins (the thread of life) intersect the excited corps. But Orpheus' beautiful lyre melody elicits a change, and merciful passage beyond the bronze door to his lost bride.<br /><br />(4) Peace. Women in palest pink dance silkily to the music of blessed souls in a peaceful subterranean meadow. From among them Eurydike, now a contented shade, emerges for a beautiful solo. Orpheus enters and looks for her, then realizes she is behind him as she takes his hand, and he leads her away.<br /><br />(5) Death. The great stage is enclosed by towering walls dwarfing the characters. Orpheus leads Eurydike in a flame red dress, not yet beyond the province of hell. Their vocal counterparts are onstage and the soprano expresses Eurydike's rising indignation because Orpheus inexplicably will not so much as look at her. Eurydike's extended solo is like a flame darting, swirling about the stage. Pushed to his edge, Orpheus finally turns to her, embraces her, she dies in his arms. Her vocal counterpart falls to the ground, his vocal counterpart kneels beside, Orpheus lays his Eurydike atop her double, and retreats to a far corner. The mezzo-soprano then dominates the stage, still kneeling, for 8 minutes singing \\"I have lost my Eurydike.\\" (This stasis did seem overlong to me, and lessened the dramatic impact.) In the ensuing silence, the three aproned beings appear and take the life of Orpheus, the music resumes and mourners appear. The body of Orpheus is placed at significant remove from Eurydike's, failing to assure us husband and wife will ever embrace again.<br /><br />AT CALLS...<br /><br />the enthusiastic audience metamorphoses into rhythmic clapping. Also, finally the Balthasar-Neumann Chorus assembles onstage, and leader Thomas Hengelbrock is led on to sweep his BN Ensemble to their feet--both chorus and musicians have certainly demonstrated artistry perfected. Then Pina Bausch is brought on to roaring appreciation. Looking frail but strong in spirit, she was to die four months after this filming.<br /><br />FOOTNOTE<br /><br />Rather than the usual plastic case, the DVD is held inside the back cover of a colorful 36-page book in English, French, and German. The opera is sung in German and subtitles are available in these three languages as well as Spanish and Italian.on to roaring appreciation.

But my sub-woofer stay quiet, and it works perfectly with another shows I have. Even raising the sub channel level of my receiver, the bass sound makes almost no vibration in my room. When I change the soundtrack to stereo PCM, everything sounds normal like a real The Killers´ show, but in DTS-MA the bass is a problem, don´t expect much more than a whisper from your sub...

B001NLKT60|4.0|You have never met anyone like Lisbeth Salander, the \\"girl\\" in the title -- guaranteed. Lisbeth is a tattooed, waif-like young woman with a brain of gargantuan proportions, an eidetic memory, an unsurpassed mastery of the Internet, and a mysterious past. In this unlikely but engrossing story of murder and corruption in the dark corners of contemporary Sweden, Lisbeth's past is revealed in an encounter reminiscent of the games played out in the bowling alley of the gods.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" is the second novel in a trilogy centered on Lisbeth Salander that launched with \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and will conclude in May 2010 with \\"The Girl Who Kicked in the Hornet's Nest.\\" Sadly, the author of this unique little crime series died shortly after delivering the manuscripts for all three novels in 2004. Larsson was the editor of a politically engaged magazine, much like Mikael Blomqvist, who figures in both this novel and its predecessor as Lisbeth's friend, foil, and sometime lover.<br /><br />The power of Larsson's spare prose and the extraordinary character of Lisbeth Salander vaulted \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" onto  best-seller lists internationally. Readers everywhere were captivated. There is much of the same experience in store for you in this sequel, but perhaps familiarity with the protagonists took the edge off my experience. I found this book slightly less satisfying than its predecessor, but I'm no less eagerly looking forward to its successor.<br /><br />(From Mal Warwick's Blog on Books)

B002YIHO7I|5.0|So much has changed in the decade since Sade released Lovers Rock. President Obama is now in the White House, today's pop stars are Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers, and AOL is a thing of the past with Myspace and Facebook taking over the web. It's good to hear Sade hasn't changed a bit. She and the boys pick up right where they left off with Soldier of Love. I'm pleased to see this new record getting alot of positive feedback since it's easily one of the best records of this short new year. Sade's still singing about love and how it can make you float in ecstasy or writhe in agony.<br /><br />The latter occurs on the intoxicating The Moon and The Sky, a track in which Sade mourns the loss of a man that she loved, but left her alone and lonely. It's almost like she casts a spell on him by telling him her love will forever haunt him. \\"You'll always know the reason why/ We could've had the moon and the sky/The reason why this love/The reason why this love/Ain't gonna let you go!\\" A haunting guitar string repeats itself throughout the song and really sets the mood of sadness and despair.<br /><br />The title track is very different from the band's earlier work. The music is more aggressive with it's heavy military drums, gritty guitars, and dark backdrop. Sade sees love as a battlefield that continually tears her heart to shreds, but she refuses to back down in defeat. \\"Still waitin' for love to come and turn it all around!\\" While the concept isn't the most original, Sade takes it to another level and it's a perfect choice for the first single. Unfortunately for some, nothing else on the album is as edgy (the same complaint of Jill Scott's last album). Fortunately for all of us, the other songs are top notch (which is also true of Jill Scott's last album).<br /><br />Sorrowful strings and a bit of piano open Morning Bird before a slight tambourine and Sade's weary voice takes over. \\"How could you/You are the river/Pour out of this life/How could you/You are the morning bird/Who sang me into life every day/Fly away.\\" Musically it's reminiscent of past songs like Pearls and Like A Tattoo. That's a VERY good thing, but I wish it were longer.<br /><br />To lighten up the mood, Babyfather slides in on a mellow, reggae inspired beat. A colorful song written for her daughter Ila (who sings a line on it) telling her that no matter what happens between her parents, her father will always love her. The chant \\"Your daddy knows... you're a flame!\\" is catchy and sweet. Band member Stuart's son Clay pitches in on background vocals and sounds wonderful.<br /><br />Long Hard Road sounds sad yet hopeful. Although life will get you down and you might not know where to turn, just remember that \\"everything's gonna be alright.\\" A great \\"I know how you feel, but you'll make it through\\" song despite how dark it seems. Be That Easy with it's country based background sounds like waking up on a Sunday morning with the bright sunshine coming in through the blinds. Hopeful and optimistic. The whistle at the end fits in perfectly.<br /><br />Bring Me Home picks up the tempo a bit. On a trip hop beat, Sade is once again weary and tired, but decides to give in to defeat. \\"Put me on a plate with petals and a fire/And send me out to sea/Turn my angry sword against my heart/And let me free.\\" She makes this high pitched cry that's addictive and perfectly conveys her frustration.<br /><br />Next up is my favorite, In Another Time. Like a mother, Sade comforts those with a broken heart and assures them that they'd \\"be surprised, girl/Soon they'll mean nothing to you/They'll fall into their brew/And take some of the boys with them too\\" and that \\"In another time, girl/Your tears won't leave a trace.\\" The music is perfect to slow dance to with it's waltz meets doo wop instrumentation. The swelling strings and Stuart's sax add to the beauty of it.<br /><br />The slow burnin' groove of Skin is another highlight. After freeing herself from a bad relationship, Sade will\\"wash you off my skin/I'm gonna peel you away/Cuz you're not right within\\" and also makes an MJ reference in the lyrics. Thankfully it feels natural rather than forced and is much appreciated. Rather than sounding hurt or depressed, she sounds almost happy to be rid of the jerk. Rumor has it this will be the second single. It should be. The acoustic The Safest Place rounds out the album with a softer finale.<br /><br />This album proves that while Sade's been gone for a decade, she hasn't lost her touch. Her voice is as smooth as ever and the band is always on their game. Of course you can't please everybody. Some people have continually accused their music of being repetitive and brand them \\"elevator muzak\\". I say they have lazy ears. Despite the haters, it's comforting to hear that other artists like Christina Aguilera, Beyonce, and Alicia Keys are excited for the new material and are respectful to Sade's sound and the influence their music has made on them. Sade's love is certainly king.t right within\\" and also makes an MJ reference in the lyrics. Thankfully it feels natural rather than forced and is much appreciated. Rather than sounding hurt or depressed, she sounds almost happy to be rid of the jerk. Rumor has it this will be the second single. It should be. The acoustic The Safest Place rounds out the album with a softer finale.    This album proves that while Sade's been gone for a decade, she hasn't lost her touch. Her voice is as smooth as ever and the band is always on their game. Of course you can't please everybody.

0823016714|2.0|As an artist I'd love a great book of facial expressions.  Unfortunately this isn't it.  It's very tedious trying to find the right expression the way this book is laid out.  I need to be able to search for a specific expression, not a model type.  Trying to find the right kind of dubious expression, or quizzical, confused, etc., is a mountainous chore because you have to search through all the various models.  I would like to see a book with fewer models, better actors, and indexed by expression type.
B002WY65VU|4.0|Woody Harrelson is flat-out hilarious as a man who shoots a ton of zombies while jonesing for Twinkies.  Abigail Breslin holds her own as a preteen shooter of the aforementioned zombies, while Jesse E. could be a ringer for Michael Cera and Emma Stone could be another Kat Dennings.      This is the U.S. of Zombieland, where even the rich and famous cannot escape the infection which has afflicted much of the population.  Somehow, the filmmakers manage to blend the gore with a lot of humor as several people come together in an impromptu family group on the road together, dealing with trust issues and constant zombie attacks--when they're not looking for those little yellow sweet delights.    Fun stuff!
B00006AVRK|5.0|This was given as a gift to someone who has enjoyed Steven Fry in QI the Series and Hugh Laurie in Black Adder.  I have had the opportunity of watching it as well.  It is as entertaining as I remembered!  The humor is dry British humor, intelligent and witty.  Many of the stories are familiar from reading them in a PG Wodehouse collection.  The boxed set is worth every penny.  Highly recommended.
B0001HLVSC|5.0|I receive an e-mail from amazon advertising delivery before Christmas, so i ordered under this assumption. To my chagrin the product arrived nearly a week after Christmas. So much for a merry Christmas... But it's a great naval movie.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|For a major \\"Horror Flick Fan\\" I was really dissappointed in this movie. It was very amature-ish, not nearly as good as the \\"Ghost Hunters\\"series (which I don't care for either) I watch it when I'm bored and can't find any thing else I want to watch. I consider it on the same level as that movie made by college kids on a school project in the woods.  This is my personal opinion of this movie.  You might really enjoy it.  Amazon has the best prices around and excellent service, I received mine within two days of my order.  Mary
B001N1DPDE|5.0|After almost 40 years of hiking, camping, etc. in the bush in all kinds of weather, I sat down one night and drew designs and specs of what I believed would be the best designed survival/bush knife for me - one handy enough to use for most smaller tasks, but solid enough not to have to worry about when chopping, splitting, batoning, etc.  A few days later, I came across the Becker Companion online and realized that Ethan Becker had already designed it.  For this knife to go off the market would be a tragic loss to anyone who really needs a great knife.  I think they should make the handle of better material, perhaps micarta. The plastic one is too slippery.  I bought an after-market micarta handle for mine and thinned it out a little.  It was a big improvement.  I also think they should consider making it of even harder steel or laminated steel for those who want to pay more.  But, the design - leave it alone.  Perfection cannot be improved.  I have Fallknivens, Bucks, Knives of Alaska, Gerbers, etc.  The Becker Companion is the one knife I would trust my life to every time. If you have to build a shelter in a storm using nothing but your knife, this is the knife you will want in your hand. Ethan Becker should get some sort of medal.  He certainly has my gratitude.  This knife whould be continually made with multiple variations in the handles and steel, not left on the shelf by its maker like it is.  Kabar is missing out on a great market opportunity.  Put a better handle on it and make it with laminated steel, and it it will sell for $300.00, easy.  I would buy two of them, and my great grandchildren would probably leave them to their kids.  Seriously, Kabar, what are you thinking not advertising this as your flagship knife?  Get out of Becker's way.
0061122416|1.0|This book is an absolute bore. I fell asleep every time I tried to read it. I had to read it for school. I can't stand the way the author goes on and on and on and on about things like Personal Legends, the Language of the World, and God of the desert and whatnot. It's a crappy book. Try reading East of Eden, by John Steinbeck. It's much better.

B001DRF84W|5.0|Although the Incredible Hulk has its moments, I still love this version of the Hulk better. I love how they delved into the psychology of Bruce Banner and why the Hulk is essentially an angry, hurt child. Ang Lee is a lot better director than Lettier in my opinion and aside from Norton, every other cast member is superior in this version. This will always be the quintessential Hulk movie for me.

0446567329|5.0|DEAR JOHN, wow!  This is only the second book I've read by Nicholas Sparks, the first being A WALK TO REMEMBER.  And thought A WALK TO REMEMBER was good and one of my favorite movies, it was nothing compared to DEAR JOHN.  Then again I imagine it didn't help that I watched A WALK TO REMEMBER several times before I read the book, and that the book was very different, yet the same if that makes sense, then the movie.<br /><br />After reading DEAR JOHN, I now realize what all the hype is about Nicholace Sparks'.  This book was well written and so much more.  I was down to the last hundred or so pages when I slipped under my covers around ten PM.<br /><br />I could not stop!  I had to know what happened.  When I finally turned the last page, through tears, I read the clock on my headboard.  It was two AM.<br /><br />ROMANCE:  Oh yea, it has it.  Loved that the POV was John's.  What a remarkable character transformation.<br /><br />GROWTH:  That too.  John went from a self-centered adolescent to a caring, loving, selfless man.<br /><br />WARMTH:  How could one not feel all warm and fuzzy inside experiencing John's love for Savannah, as well as for his father?<br /><br />The next morning I felt as though my life had been alter just a bit because of John's story.  Honestly, I wanted nothing more than to sit down and start from page one, rereading each and every word.  For now, as a writer, I've been inspired and challenged with a jolt.  Its novels like these that are at the heart of where I strive to one day be as a writer.<br /><br />I'm excited to see the movie, DEAR JOHH but will need to let the written words sink in and settle, first.  I don't think I can handle the movie just yet.  My emotions are still reeling from the written words.
1878424505|4.0|I had to read this book for a class I was taking. While the book is written with ideas that differ from the norm, the main ideas are phenomenal! I looked past the parts I didn't agree with because the overall meaning is so great -I have recommended it to many people and use those main ideas most every day - I wish I had read this book sooner in my life.
1569242739|5.0|My husband and I decided to take the vegan plunge just under a year ago, with few expectations. We were in a \\"recipe rut\\" in the pre-veg era, and becoming vegan forced us outside of our cooking comfort zone in such wonderful ways! Terry and Isa's books have been incredible in our transition. We started with the Veganomicon and then moved on to VCTOTW, Vegan Brunch, etc. Without them, I'd never know that I'm actually decent at cooking (and even enjoy it)!<br /><br />Having not been much of a baker prior to this book, I was a bit scared before making the first recipe, but they-as well as all of the others I've tried-turned out moist, delicious, and quite beautiful! We've made about 8 of the recipes thus far, and my favorites are the carrot cupcakes, but there are many more to try, and I can't wait to test out the rest! The tips throughout the book make it fool-proof, and since most of the ingredients that are called for should be staples in any vegan kitchen, they're generally quite inexpensive to make. I'm so grateful that these lovely ladies have turned vegan cooking into something fun and super, super delicious.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I have read all three of Robert Ludlum's books about Jason Bourne.  Often when I see a movie after reading the book I am disappointed because so much more is in the book and the movie seems to be \\"short\\".  That is not the case in the Bourne trilogy.  The movies are generally true to the books and Matt Damon is superb as Jason Bourne.  The other characters are well played, also.  Just an excellent viewing and entertainment experience.
0375842209|5.0|It might take a while to get into this book, but once you do...prepare to fall in love with every single character. Great read for adults and young adults.
B003102JDM|1.0|With the DVD jacket literally covered in 4-star reviews and having loved previous Coen Brothers movies, I thought this was a sure thing. Well, it's probably one of the top three worst movies I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. Please save yourself two hours and watch something else.
B0027CSNBM|5.0|I Really love the series, I got this one because it has stories I haven't read yet, and it was a great continuation since i haven't read the last book yet.     It came really quickly even though I didn't pay for express post, I got it like three or four days after i ordered it when they told me to expect it in like eleven days so that was a bonus.     If you like the series you'll love this book, it had awesome pictures in it too.

B0009S2T0M|4.0|This movie pulls you in and keeps you guessing. It's basically a story of revenge wrapped in a mystery. The second half of the movie is quite edgy. There is graphic violence and a fairly gruesome scene where the main character cuts off his own tongue. That little detail doesn't give away anything in the main plot, but it should provide our gentle viewers with fair and sufficient warning. Take the R rating seriously. This movie is not for kids or teenagers. It's for mature adults who occasionally like to explore cinema's darker realm. The ending has a clever, but disturbing, twist. Some call it brilliant, perhaps with good reason. It's like a bloody version of an M. Night Shyamalan film. The purple surprise package ties up all the loose ends. You won't be perplexed. You'll know exactly what has happened and why. The English dubbing is well done. You don't need to read subtitles. By the way, ever watch a movie called Angels & Insects?
1450515843|1.0|I don't know how these people get away with calling this a \\"1st Edition\\" -- Jane Austen books have been in print for 200 years.  Don't get sucked into paying such a ridiculous price for a new paperback edition of an old classic.  Download the e-text for free if you haven't read the book yet.  If you like it, buy a nice edition for less than $10.
B0013FSXT6|5.0|Kubrick definitely doesn't disappoint in this one. I thought it was better than I expected since I wasn't really sure  what to think with that cover and synopsis. All the great cinematography and strange themes you'd expect from Stanley are there. Definitely worth the buy, especially on Blu-ray.

1433502429|5.0|This is the most amazing study Bible that I have ever seen. It uses the ESV translation, which I find to be one of the best translations out there and my personal favorite. The study notes and cross references are top-notch and comprehensive. The articles at the end are magnificent and scholarly. It has everything that a serious student of the Bible needs. The TruTone cover is well made and nice to the touch. If fact I like it better than the genuine leather ones I have. If you could only have one Bible, this is the one you want.  UPDATE: I recently received a Kindle as a gift and this was the first book I downloaded. It's easy to navigate and the set-up between the Bible text and the notes is amazing.

B002VWNICW|5.0|I dared watch this movie on DVD with my wife, because my brother assured me it is awesome, despite being a girly movie.  Lo! and behold!  It is not a girly movie, but a work of literature accessible to everyone transferred to the screen with emotion and beauty!!  Wow!!      The next day after viewing it, I logged onto my email, and was about to delete all the advertisement emails I regularly get from amazon and other companies without looking at them as usual, when my finger halted, and I then unchecked the box next to an amazon ad saying \\"new blu-ray releases,\\" thinking to myself, \\"just in case Pride and Prejudice came out on blu-ray.\\"  I opened that message, and there it was - a sign from heaven.  I purchased it as fast as my finger could click, and watched it again as soon as it arrived two days later!      Very convincing acting, beautiful set design and very entertaining story!  Fantastic!    Only negative aspect of the blu-ray compared to DVD: title screen is ridiculous mechanized console with ludicrous sound effects -- very opposite the atmosphere of the movie.  Hurry and push play to see as little of the menu as possible.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|I decided to purchase this movie based on the excitement with which people reviewed it.  I read in one review approximately this: \\"Errol Flynn plays Robin the way Robin should be played: consider the scene where Robin walks into the castle where Prince John and his followers are dining, and throws a dead deer down on the table before them, knowing full well the penalty for poaching is death.  His eyes shift to the guards by the doors -- not with fear or hesitation, but anticipation!\\"      As soon as I finished reading that line, I hurried as fast as I could to click \\"purchase.\\"  It couldn't get here fast enough. The wife and I watched it the night it arrived and watched it again two days later, and may watch it again any day now (a couple weeks later) with a friend.  We adore it, and find ourselves smiling when we think of it just because it's so awesome!  This is the Robin Hood I remember from literature -- no boring, drawn-out modern plot changes to cast ambiguity on meaning or morality, but straightforward goodness and fun.      Don't let the year of production discourage you: the technicolor looks amazing, and the action is ten times more exciting than all other movies I've seen since Return of the King!  Buy it!  Buy two copies and give one as a gift!  Or keep the second just because it's that joyous!
0446567329|5.0|I love this book. It was so good. the way mr.sparks writes is so wonderful. I could not put it down.

B000B5XOSO|4.0|Overall, I am not a big fan of the 90s Batman movie series.  I thought the series ranged from melodramatic to campy.  However, I thought this movie was pretty good.  Just to recap how I felt about the other movies, I thought the first Batman, released in 1989, was a complete waste of potential.  The title character, Batman, was completely overshadowed by the Joker, whose performance I didn't even like.  There were other problems with that movie, but that was my main issue.  I actually thought Batman Forever was okay, something I'll go into detail on when I review that movie.  As for Batman and Robin, well, I don't even feel the need to mention that pitiful mess of a movie.  It killed the franchise for eight years, so enough said.  But this movie, I thought was pretty good.  It has it's flaws, and it's far from perfect.  But I think it is the closest thing this first movie series cameto making a good Batman film.    Let's start with the one thing I liked about the previous movie, the overall look of Gotham.  I thought that was the one good thing about Batman '89, and ironically, it's the one thing I dislike about this movie.  It just looks a little too dark and creepy.  I know Gotham is supposed to look dark and creepy, but that's because it's supposed to be overrun by crime.  It looks like the set of Sweeny Todd or Edward Scissorhands.  Now I know that in some of the graphic novels Gotham can kind of look like Burton's take, but this is supposed to be a sequel to his first movie.  Why does the city look completely different here?  Did the city get destroyed and have to be rebuilt?      With that out of the way, let's discuss Batman.  Michael Keaton reprised his role, and does a pretty good job this time around.  People complain that he doesn't have enough screen time in this movie.  I thought he had a lot more screen time in this movie that in the previous one.  But I'd have to time it or something to be sure.  Batman is developed a lot more this time, especially through his relationship with Selina Kyle, AKA Catwoman.  They still didn't really get him down pat, but they at least made the effort.  Michael Keaton is a pretty good Batman, but he's the worst Bruce Wayne by far.  It is arguable that it is just as important to play a good Bruce Wayne as it is to play a good Batman.  We wouldn't get someone who could do both until 2005.  This may not be Keaton's fault, he was just playing the role he was given.  But Bruce Wayne is supposed to be an arrogant playboy, not someone who will stand up to someone like Christopher Walken's character and try to do the right thing.  This approach to Bruce Wayne is not the worst thing they could have done with his character, but it still wasn't the right one.    Unfortunately, once again, Batman is overshadowed by the villians.  Let's start with Danny Devito's take on the Penguin.  In the comics, I don't think the Penguin is supposed to be some kind of deformed individual.  He's just supposed to be a short, stubby guy.  And he isn't supposed to be a crazy guy who wants to kill all the babies, he's basically just a corrupt businessman.  I know there's more to it than that, but this interpretation of him is way off.  The thing is, I like this interpretation better.  They did kind of createtheir own character and call him the Penguin, but personally, I don't think the Penguin in the comics is all that interesting.  That's just my opinion and you are free to disagree.  But I loved this interpretation of the Penguin.  He's deformed, he was abandoned by his parents, and that makes him want to do the things he does.  He is incredibly evil and sadistic, but at the same time you feel sorry for him because of his past.  Danny Devito's Penguin is absolutely one of my favorite movie villians of all time, right up there with the T-1000 and Darth Vader.    I thought Michelle Pfeiffer did a great job as Catwoman.  Her performance wasn't as memorable as Devito's, but it was still pretty good.  Secretary Selina Kyle is nurdered by her evil boss, Max Schrek, played by Christopher Walken.  She is somehow revived when a bunch of cats come up to her and start to crawl over her.  This brings her back to life, giving her cat powers.  This is probably the most underexplained point in the whole movie.  But once that's over, we get a pretty good interpretation of Catwoman.  She wants revenge on Schrek, and does stuff to tick him off, like blowing up his store.  She runs into Batman, and starts up a love/hate relationship with him.  At the same time, as Selina Kyle, she falls in love with Bruce Wayne.  This causes her to falter, but in the end she chooses her vendetta against Schrek over her feelings for Bruce.      Also...why does Batman kill?  He hasn't killed in comics since 1940.  He does not kill in The Dark Knight Returns, contrary to what some people think.  The fact that he doesn't kill is one of the defining attributes of the character.  I like this movie, but it is not Batman.  It is Tim Burton doing his own thing and calling it a Batman movie.  The fact that I happened to like it is irrelevent.

B002DKGWSE|5.0|Wow - incredible film!  I agree with Stephen King that this was the best scary movie of 2009.  The story is excellent.  The attention to detail is off the charts. The suspense factor is high.  Just an amazing film!
B002WY65VU|3.0|A few laughs here and there and the whole amusement park action stuff was cool.  Other than that its pretty stupid and corny, plus Amber Heard the hottest chick turns zombie and dies way too soon.

B002YIHO7I|1.0|It is a travesty! I have been robbed! My $9.99 is  gone like a fart in the wind!<br />The latest CD by Sade is an obvious obligatory effort. It sounds like they owed one more album<br />for their label. Ten years away and they return with a measly ten tracks to appease \\"massa\\".<br />Some tone deaf record executive got whatever Sade submitted and rushed it to his art department.They dressed it up in an artsy military façade.  Even shot a video for the best song.  Now the group's on a  brief promo / TV appearance tour in  New York to generate a buzz for their swan song  before \\"you know who\\" goes back into hibernation.<br />The title track is as good as it gets. The remaining nine songs serve as trifle filler. Sade's<br />lead vocals range from low to lower and offer no flexibility. Her male background vocalists shadow her aimless muttering and sputtering. The tone of this project is dead, gloomy and dark. After my two forced attempts to perceive this misfire objectively, I suspect that Sade needs Prozac, Zoloft or Xanax. Calling Dr. Feel Good! Sade needs a prescription to lighten her spirits up.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|Awsome collection of several well known favorites that get occasional airplay on oldies stations mixed with an abundance of tunes very rarely if ever heard- since I was there. Exposes younger listeners to more of the sound of the 60's and for those that were there, it brings it back.  One of the best CD's I've ever heard.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|Great classic story, we love aristocats.  no violence,a beautiful story with great animations and music,the quality is very good concidering how old this movie is!!!  I highly recomend this CD.

B000YDIA00|5.0|I'd wanted a pair for a while, as I'm big into trying to do the right thing for the environment, and I truly believe Timberland are trying. I tried a pair on in a store, a size 7, and they were a half-size too small. I normally am a size 9, but ordered a 7.5 and they're perfect. I really like the way they look, but best of all is how comfortable they are. They're so light, it's like you're wearing a shoe. Very good purchase!!
B002S9DRA6|4.0|I couldn't wait to get this collection.  Yes, I knew what was on it when I bought it and after listening to it...I missed the fiery sound of the originals.  All the hits are there, Sadeness, the Gravity of Love, both by Enigma and the other artists.  Yet, I felt like I was listening to a different Enigma, a more distant, cerebral (?!) Enigma.  These were not quite the songs that had grabbed me over the past two decades and this set would not be the first place I would go to introduce someone to the sound of this pioneering band.  However, the tribute bands exploded with some of the songs, louder, lustier, fresh.  The \\"Lost\\" CD could be from another band, all ambient, few highs and lows, mellow for reading, meditating.  Overall this is an okay collection for fans but the old material, sounds old, and the new material will be different from what you are used to expecting from Enigma.
B0026P3G12|5.0|From the moment I heard Susan Boyle sing this song on U Tube, I knew that if she ever put out an album I would buy it.  What more is there to say? She is wonderful and so is the rest of the CD.
B00150B2SS|3.0|I was really hoping to like this book, but unfortunately it wasn't for me.  I couldn't finish it---I just kept confusing the different characters and subplots.  Part of my problem was that I could only read it in fits and starts---twenty minutes here, fifteen minutes there, an hour here, and then a day or two missed.  And the problem with that is that this book is full of endless complex and nuanced characters, each with his or her own little important peccadilloes, and thus really does require focus and dedication.  I kept mixing people up, forgetting who was who, and what their different roles and traits were.<br /><br />What would have helped me is this:  a list of each character with a little explanatory paragraph about who they are, what their characteristics are, and what their role is.  Also, a glossary of terms might have helped, because half the time I didn't know what was really going on.<br /><br />Of course, had I devoted a lot more conscious energy to the book, and read it in a much more serious and dedicated way---as I'm sure many people do---I'm sure I could have sorted this out, and probably would have loved the book, but my reasons for reading it were different.  I read it as relaxation material---nothing requiring much from me.  Alas!

B001HQZKF6|5.0|High quality blue ray.  The boys still have it. A must have for any Police fan.  A nice 2 cd set that comes with it of the live show as well. One of my best live concert shows.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Enjoy with family, kids and adults alike. No need to over-analyze and break it down as to why it's good.  Sit back and watch!
0307266303|5.0|I heard a snatch of the author speaking about his book on Public Radio one day.  I decided to see if I could track down the book and purchase it for my brother,a marathon runner!  After a little research at Amazon.com, I FOUND it!  I purchased a copy for myself AND for my brother.  I loved reading it and my brother says it's the most interesting book he's ever read.  Even for non-runners (me) it was a very interesting, captivating book.
045122499X|5.0|Book arrived in reasonable time.  No hurry requested.  Condition was \\"excellent\\" for a used book.  Price was very fair and I am completely satisfied with the purchase.  Thanks Amazon for your usual reliability.  Now, I can't wait to read the book!
B002E2QHBS|4.0|I purchased this box set for my girlfriend as a Christmas present and she really likes it.  She's much younger than an actual Woodstock attendee, but an avid fan of music of the times.  She appreciated having some of the songs that are hard to come by and the live Woodstock versions available as well.  She is a big fan of the set.  It's nice to get so much variety in one collection.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|I suggest you contact seller prior to purchase to make sure you are not receiving a bootlegged copy when buying a used item.  We suspected this was a bootlegged copy, so we contacted Disney.  To describe the bootleg to you: the printing looked almost professional except it had a copied look to it; the \\"select angle\\" button came up a lot while we were watching it, although usually at the chapter marks; the picture was very pixelated while we were watching it when there was a lot of action in the scene. After speaking to Disney, also, the underside of the disc says, \\"Beauty and Beast Disc 1 D9A.\\" I was told by their representative that Disney doesn't print the name of the movie on the underside; rather, they print a barcode.  And we were asked to report it.
B002QNGKGW|5.0|I have not enjoyed many TV shows, series, especially after Sex and the City... but when my sister told me about Dexter .. at  first i was not impressed and thought, who wants to watch a psychopath killing innocent people, a serial killer. What could this show possibly have that would keep someone interested more than 2 episodes.. but i thought i would give it a try. So here i am...Season 4 Episode 12 ... and wanting more ... i know it is make believe but i love, the character he is so believable! and yet he pulls you in and you love the character, and see he truly does have a good heart, keeping you watching episode after episode wanting to change for his wife and family you see him really trying to become a better person... then the twist at the end of Episode 12... what are they going to do w the character next? how will it change the show? i want more and i need to purchasethe fourth season
B002YIHO7I|2.0|It really hurts me to give this 2 stars. I am a HUGE Sade fan and I am VERY dissappointed. I only like 2 songs. The first two tracks. I can't believe 10 years has gone by and this is the outcome. It is very boring. I thought it would be upbeat after hearing Solider of Love. The passion behind her voice seems to be missing. I think she waited too long to come back. Same with Whitney Houston and Maxwell. It really hurts to give her two stars. 1 track a year you would think it would have been much better than this. The CD is way too short and more tracks should have been added. I tried to like the cd, but I just can't. Her voice is even annoying. I NEVER felt that way about Sade.
B000GG4Y3M|4.0|When I first saw this at my friends house I thought that this was such a cool movie! It has action, romance, butt-kicking, etc everything that is needed in a good movie.
B000F0UUT6|2.0|The DVD color is a disaster!  The only consolation is that I'm not alone in my opinion.  The adaptation itself is brilliant, and having enjoyed the VHS, I decided that modern technology being what it is (or so I thought), the DVD version would be convenient to own.  I'm keeping the VHS plugged in.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|My daughter loves her, and I got her this cd for Christmas. She was in tears she was so happy! Good music and she seems like a good model for my daughter.
B000000HX0|5.0|This the best Smashing Pumkins album ever and listening to it on vinyl is an especially awesome experience. Buy this!
0439023491|5.0|I loved this book, as I loved its predecessor. Be warned this series is violent for a YA series.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I just got this today, it is beautiful packaged with a book, along with four CDs and one DVD.      I saw this advertise at other places for more money. this was certainly worth the price.
B001H5X7I4|3.0|The opening sequence was perfect, absolutely, gut-bustingly, eye-wateringly perfect.  Then, unfortunately...it's hit and miss after that.  But that opening, wow, recommendable just for that!
B001JRB16U|5.0|Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are just great together.  Bought this for my granddaughters and they have enjoyed watching it along with their grandparents.  A good clean family movie.
0385504225|2.0|I purchased this for my wife she was dissapointed with this book. She liked Dan's other novels but not this one.
0689878451|5.0|A sweet book based on a true story. Good way to illustrate that all it takes is love to make a family. We gave it to two very different 3 year olds and they both love it.
B001D2AYCI|1.0|Maybe all who were duped can file a lawsuit against amazon and others involved... i have a difficult time finding true sacds and dvd audio at a decent price that has not been misrepresented or a bootleg. if you are a seller on amazon and want my business in the future please respond to this and refund my money .
B000EHSVSC|5.0|it came great perfect conditions on the package and the actual quality was great, didn't actually see the movie but only a part of it as it was a gift for my grandfather but he loved it.
B000006UD8|3.0|97 remix is better than origional-mainly because the mix has a made in japan sound to it. I was wondering how you get the quad songs to play in quad? I have the equipment to listen to other discs both sacd and dvd audio.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|This review will be brief as the numerous reviews previously written say it all.     I will start by saying this album is somberly exciting. Each song works together to create a smooth groove of romanticism and tranquil spirit. \\"Soldier Of Love\\" is like a homecoming in that it's warm and familiar with a few new elements adding to the surprise and excitement of being back with someone that you love.    In short Sade's new album steps forward with a familiar sound fit for 2010.
1563898586|4.0|I read a few of the bad reviews here as I always do first off to get the lay of the land and most of them seem to have a problem with the morality of the story and the art work. To me this is strange as the art work is it's strength and I didn't find the whole thing particularly immoral though the invisible man character is amoral but is meant to be so... ?!?     Kevin O'Neill drew a lot for 2000 A.D. which I read as a kid and I personally like his style. Yes he isn't a classical artist, has funny ideas of perspective, is weak when doing action scenes, looks like he uses the thinnest pen nib available and his panels can get very cluttered - but I like it! I like the fact that there is so much going on in each panel, though sometimes it can make following the story difficult it always keeps me interested and he is obviously a very talented guy with his own unique style. His creativity and eye for detail goes into every panel and his city landscapes are bustling with people going about their every day business who have nothing to do with story. Most artists don't even bother, but Kevin O'Neil gives you the joy of checking out each page to make sure you don't miss anything. The big problem I did have was with the writer/artist mix. I agree with what other people said about this being more an exercise in research and cleverness. Moore's wordy dialogues don't really go with O'Neills detailed art - too much confusion, and that's why I didn't give it 5 stars.I was actually going to give it 3 stars but the art work was too good for that. The story isn't really gripping but a lot of the dialogue is funny especially between Quartermain and Murray. The best part of the book is the too short interlude between Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty - simple, few words and great art work - if the rest of the book had been like that I would have given it 6 stars.    In short this is recommended, it may not be the best comic on the planet but is of high quality and if you love comics you will not be disappointed.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much after renting it from Netflix that I had to own this DVD as my favorite collection. In addtion, I went to NYC and watched the play alive on broadway...I like the movie the most, beautiful songs with gorgeous people and lovely settings...Very well-done!
B000W745CU|5.0|Received product in excellent condition in a timely manner without any problems. I would use the system to purchase items again and inform my friends of my satisfaction.
0307454541|4.0|I thought this was a fascinating book, though not a perfect one.  The mystery was laid out thoughtfully and kept me in suspense until it was solved.  The secondary plot about the evil financier was less well done.  We don't spend time with this faceless man who drives this part of the story, so this section feels half-baked though the outcome is fun.<br /><br />I found the characters to be interesting.  Not all were as fleshed out as I'd like.  The large family had some fascinating people in it, but more revelations about what they were thinking and why they behaved as they did would have been nice.  I really liked the two main characters though.  The heroine especially is original and layered, and I can't wait to find out more about her in the next book.  Her combination of strength and vulnerability is unique to my experience and I read a lot, though not so many crime novels.<br /><br />A note about the crimes against women in the book.  The title of the book in the original language is \\"Men who hate Women\\".  And that's what the book is about, especially as seen through the eyes of the heroine.  She's a victim who's learning to reach out a bit, while still fighting for herself and other victims.  The book is, to my mind, very unforgiving of these crimes.  But it recognizes that there are different ways to deal with them, especially when taking the victims into account.  I didn't always agree with the characters' choices, but I understood them.  And I understood that these were the characters' choices, not the author's, and not meant to be instructive toward society.  But they made me think and question, and that can never be a bad thing.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book truly is probably the best book I have ever read. The plot is great, the characters amazing, and the writing style is fantastically vivid.  Rick Riordan's book sucked me, and I couldn't put it down.  My copy is so well thumbed that the pages are coming out- another advantage to the Kindle as opposed to ordinary books! So just try this book.  I bet every penny I own that you'll be glad you did.
B002T9H2L0|2.0|Long, boring, pointless. For a film about this crazy commando unit that goes Nazi hunting, there sure was very little of that going on. Just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. About nothing, and mostly from characters who weren't even \\"The Basterds\\". I think Brad Pitt and his merry band have a total of 30 minutes screen time in what is an insufferably long film. I should have guessed from the very first scene at the French farmhouse that this was going to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long while.    If you must, out of curiosity or masochism or whatever, see this film for yourself, I highly suggest renting it first.    I'm so over Tarantino. He's like the magazine collage maker of film. Just a bunch of stuff done by someone else pasted all over the place.

1591843162|5.0|This is a fantastic book. However, I would recommend listening to the audio book version because the author's enthusiasm really focuses your attention.

B0001AUAU4|5.0|I don't speak French, but Ms Bruni's voice is like a narcotic, and I can't get enough of it.  Some of the music is featured in \\"Conversations With Other Women\\", a rather interresting movie.  Although I liked the movie, I would have watched it again just to hear her voice.    bh
B00319ECHE|4.0|This album is definitely worth buying, if you have ever liked this band or just finding out about them, its definitely worth it.  What really irritates me tho, is that a lot of people are talking about Demanufacture and Obsolete, but the truth is who cares when and where this album fits.  Its become a trend these days for metal bands to get heavier, and if you dont believe me check out new releases from Dope, PM5K, Sepulutura, Soulfly, Mudvayne, etc. I guarantee if you check out any of these bands releases the older stuff will have reviews that say not as good as this one, and you'll prolly see sell out a lot.  The truth is times have changed look at when those cds were released, nu metal was huge and bands were getting signed right and left.  The trend back than was to drop the whole tough metal and go just a little softer, more radio friendly if you will.  Don't get me wrong this band and the bands i listed are bands I've been a fan of for years and I honestly can't complain about any releases they have made.  Every CD has its place in my collection, and I will frequent them when the mood strikes me.  One more trend that has been big recently is old bands who broke up are getting back together, Fear Factory is one of them, but look at Max and Igor, Living Sacrifice, VOD, Testament, Obituary, I even consider Slayer to be in that list considering the length of time between releases.  Bottom line don't try to compare to other releases just be happy this band got back together and made a very good CD.
B00000DHRX|5.0|I got this for my mom.  She loved it. It was in great condition. I also arrived within a week.
B00288KNJU|5.0|I read all these negative reviews about how awful the 3d part of this set was.  If you are smart enough not to expect it to be nearly as good as the movies I think you will be nicely surprised.  Just make sure you set your TV to \\"standard\\" mode and turn out all the lights.  The colors will not be nearly as good as the 2D version but they were not as bad as I thought they would of been either.    If you want a review of the movie itself there are plenty of movie review sites.  I think there should be PRODUCT reviews here since we are considering purchsing the actual products.
B002ZG98J6|4.0|Here's a review that fans of the book and parents alike should find helpful.  Despite targeting a younger audience, Lightning Thief is actually a fun movie that grown-ups can also enjoy.<br /><br />The Lightning Thief is based on the first novel in a five-book series by Rick Roardan.  Readers may be a bit confused by the film, as Percy is only 12 in the book, but 17 in the movie.  My guess is that Chris Columbus, who also directed Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, made the age change just to appeal to Harry Potter fans now in their late teens.<br /><br />Logan Lerman (3:10 to Yuma) does a good job playing anxious teen Percy Jackson.  Uma Thurman is a terrific addition as Medusa, though she could have gotten more screen time.  While the concept of Greek Mythology in the future sets the film apart from Harry Potter, the chemistry between Percy and his two companions seems a little familiar.  What's great about Lightning Thief are the frequent comic interjections by Brandon T. Jackson (Alpa Chino in Tropic Thunder), playing Percy's wisecracking best friend.<br /><br />Parents, here's the rundown: Teens and tweens will enjoy the movie's visuals, but a few fight scenes (Furies & Hydra) might frighten your little ones.  Rosario Dawson is gorgeous as  Persephone, the seductive wife of Hades; though her suggestive lines will go over most kid's heads.  For adults who aren't into Harry Potter movies, you'll still find the visuals fun, and the movie entertaining.<br /><br />Take my advice about one thing: Don't finish watching the movie when the credits start rolling.  You'll be in for a fun surprise if you hang in there for just a minute ;)
B003539QKO|2.0|im YOUNG JOE an UP n COMING rapper producer... i have a cd available on amazon myself in mp3 download format.. its titled The Last Hope i ask for ya to take a listen i promise none of ya will be dissapointed.. show some love n support to great music..
B0000025D0|5.0|Admittedly not a huge Bruce fan, although I've always loved Thunder Road. Elvis Costello mentioned this album along with E Street Shuffle when he interviewed Springsteen on his show Spectacle. Elvis gushed over them. So I bought both cd's. Not too crazy about E Street. Put this on....WOW! one reviewer mentioned a religious experience..yeah, that's pretty close to it for me.I had already heard at least four of these songs on the radio over the years, but this was the first time I had ever heard Adam Raised a Cain, Candy's Room and Racing in the Streets.Can't get enough.So Powerful!!! Even the songs I've heard over and over on classic radio stations like Promised Land, seem to take on more power or something when listened to along with these songs. One song feeds off the next. This cd has not been off my player.It's a great feeling to hear amazing music from someone you'd kind of written off...Maybe I'll give E street another listen.
B002KH4KSY|4.0|Having read several reviews for this remake, I can honestly say that I like both versions for their merits-some parts are comparable, others are not.  The acting in both at least to me is decent-although Issac in this one sounds like a fire and brimstone preacher, in the original, he sounds and acts alot creepier.  As for Vicky-I like Linda's portrayal better, I'll be honest, but you need to remember, a crumbling marriage means all bets are off...sometimes, so I understand why she acted the way she did, admittedly though I like Peter Horton better too.  The music in both versions is good, the special f/x are good in both, more differences than comparisons, and the ending is more fitting for an SK movie this time-the evil is stopped but not destroyed, not to mention at a price, a terrible one at that!  To make a long story short-both versions are good to me, but maybe I'm too liberal for my own good. Re-makes can be good, as I've often said-and they shouldn't follow the original scene for scene anyway, when they do for me it ruins the story both ways, predictability isn't always a problem for me, but with re-makes, changing the story can make it more interesting-what RZ did with Halloween/Michael Myers was brilliant, same with Jason Vorhees.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This is truly the best adaptation of Emma.  You will fall in love with the characters.  You can believe these characters are real.  You will become so involved that you will watch it over and over and feel you are part of the story!
1401307787|5.0|Liked WHEREVER YOU GO THERE YOU ARE: MINDFULNESS MEDITATION<br />IN EVERYDAY LIFE, written and read by Jon Kabat-Zinn.<br /><br />The author, founder and director of the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University<br />of Massachusetts Medical Center, does a fine job in presenting an introduction<br />to Buddhist meditation . . . the key is to practice \\"mindfulness,\\" a more than<br />2000-year-olld method of living fully in the present while observing ourselves,<br />our feelings, others and our surroundings without judging them.<br /><br />WHEREVER YOU GO is broken down into three parts. The first explores the<br />reasons why you should take or or deepen a personal practice of meditation. Part<br />two explores some of the basic aspects of any mediation practice. And part three<br />explores various applications and perspectives on the concept of mindfulness.<br /><br />I liked the fact that the book wasn't full of jargon, and that it was easy to both<br />understand and apply . . . I also liked Kabat-Zinn's amusing stories of how<br />mindfulness could be applied to everyday life, including \\"Cleaning the Stove<br />While Listening to Bobby MdFerrin,\\" \\"Cat Food Lessons\\" and the two chapters<br />on parenting as a form of meditation (and how he called children \\"live-in<br />Zen masters\\").<br /><br />Although I don't presently meditate on any sort of regular basis, the author<br />has gotten me to revisit that practice.

0330485377|5.0|Very well written, amazing story, It broke my heart. I didnt really think I would like the story so much, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Haunting story that will stick with you long after you have read the last page.
0470449764|4.0|For anybody with serious plans to improve their GMAT score, this book is an absolute must.  Regardless of your level of skill, this book will be at least somewhat useful.  Nothing can substitute for \\"official\\" GMAT questions, and this book will help any student get the hang of the GMAT's quirky style--and learning to deal with that style  is arguably as important as learning the math itself.      That said, this book has tons of imperfections.  First, there really aren't enough tough questions in here, especially on the problem solving side.  My students seem to struggle much more on the data sufficiency, but a 650+ GMAT student will have limited opportunities to break a sweat.    Sadly, GMAC has also cheated us a little bit.  There are only 74 new questions (the cover promises 75 new questions... and yes, I was silly enough to count them all), and they really don't break much new ground from the 1st edition.  As always, the explanations are often incomprehensible, and rarely explain the best way to do a particular math problem.  And many of the new questions also appear in the GMAT Focus tests, so you might end up paying for them twice.      Pretty annoying, but this is still a necessary supplement to the official guide.  Grumble if you must, but buy a copy anyway.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I bought the DVD for my 2 year old granddaughter. She loves the music and all the action.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|A valuable source of information on the war although from a British perspective.  The narration held my attention.  I would recommend the video highly to those individuals interested in viewing the emotional as well as the factual information through period newsreels and newscasts.  The coverage is incomplete but then when has the news ever been objective.
B0016OOM7Q|5.0|Great presentation on this vinyl Madonna, really a collectible item. 100% recomendable. Amazon thank you very much to get ahead of schedule.
0764207407|5.0|This beloved classic, Sense and Sensibility, never fails to please.  This recent printing, however, takes the beloved classic a step further.  Interlaced onto the pages are facts, trivia, and inspiration, enhancing the reading of the classic.  The \\"insight\\" brings humor and knowledge to the page - giving historical facts to help the reader understand the context, showing humor in an otherwise vague passage, and giving movie references (from the many cinematic versions of the story).  A Jane Austen fan will definitely enjoy this \\"insight edition\\" of one of her classics.
B0034EIVKK|3.0|I bought this without even listening to any previews. I figured it was Gil, so no worries. I was shocked upon hearing his voice. Perhaps I'd forgotten it had been many long years since he'd put out anything & many years since I'd seen him perform in person. So at first listen, I didn't like it at all. But I didn't like sushi at first either. Had to eat it a few more times before I could say I liked it. Reckon it'll be the same with this new output. I'll listen a few more times with fresh ears. I would like to see what he puts out next.
074322454X|4.0|Having seen snippets of the Band of Brothers miniseries, I was very excited to read the book. Of course, as a history major and knowing that this was a history book, not a novel, I knew what not to expect...but to be completely honest, I was still a bit disappointed. Having read Ghost Soldiers (about the Bataan Death March) last year and enjoyed that book as much as I've enjoyed any novel, Band of Brothers was a bit too fast paced at times and included what I felt were too many lists of companies, names, etc. to be extremely interesting. I know that Ambrose interviewed a lot of the men of Easy Company and I think he discounted some of their quotes and personal stories in order to make this more like a book a teacher would assign and less like something one would want to read for fun. Still, because I'm used to reading books like this (and far worse!) I liked it enough to give it 3.5 out of 5 stars...of course Amazon doesn't allow half stars, and I feel that if anything, the history was accurate, hence the bump up to 4 stars here.
0805091742|4.0|Gawande is a fine writer who knows how to tell a story or anecdote.  However, unlike Better and Complications, he tries to move from simply telling interesting stories to telling interesting stories in order to sell a larger message.   Unfortunately the results are less than satisfactory.  The stories are less interesting than those in previous books because we know long before we start where the stories are going (hint: see the title of the book).  The larger message, that the use of well thought out checklists can dramatically improve medicine and other comlex areas, is not explored in nearly enough detail.  Very few pages are devoted to the nuts and bolts of the design and implementation of checklists.  The book could have used far more analysis of where and why checklists have succeeded or failed and more discussion of their pros and cons would have helped.  In addition, he doesn't spend much time talking about innovative ways to implement checklists (e.g. would having a vast array of checklists available for instant access on an iPhone or iPad be valuable in a hospital?  Or would the cost, time and effort take away from face to face patient care.)  Overall, I think the book would have been better if either (a) he stuck to telling interesting medical stories or (b) he dived much more deeply into his checklist manifesto.  I would have preferred the latter option - I think his thesis is both correct and very important but it deserved a much more detailed and rigorous presentation.  At the end I felt disappointed - his talent and the subject could have produced a game changing book, instead he merely produced a decent book.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This was a really great movie.  It touched my heart in addition to being the type of fast action I expected from Clint Eastwood.  It gave me a lot to think about.  I very rarely find a movie that I would watch a second time, but I could watch this one again.
B0030BYWKK|3.0|I actually expected an album like this, kind of laser like focused and begrudginly dedicated to it's purpose -- which is to pay homage to some funky folk 60's sound.  Funny enough I think this album reminds me more of Banman than of Van Occupanther, where they just stuck to a sound and played it out through the album.  I don't care what anyone says about boring or monotonous, this album is interestingly dark, textured and meaningful and is a delight to listen to.  Midlake is a good band, if you take and listen to their three albums straight, I would say it's a rather mind bending experience.  I can't wait to see what they have in store for the next album, I have the feeling we won't be waiting as long....
B000VBJEEG|5.0|When they were airing movie trailers on Ratatouille it sounded like a fun movie to watch so I waited for it to arrive on DVD. I did not want to buy it before seeing it, so I rented it from Netflix and loved it. The fact it is a Pixar movie made that easy to understand as I had already enjoyed Finding Nemo which made the talking fish seem believable with very expressive faces. Ratatouille followed suit with mobile faces and very expressive eyes, and a story of a young rat named Remy who didn't want to grow up eating garbage. His way out was a restaurant in Paris that had once been rated five stars but lost two due to a bad review, and the death of its head chef. Enter Remy and an ambitious garbage boy named Alfredo Linguini who can't cook, but wants to. With Remy controlling Linguini, they make magic in the kitchen and win over the customers. Now they have to win over the very critic who had cost the restaurant one of its five stars with his bad review. Plenty of color, action, music, even a little singing, all form a wonderful picture I recommend to children and adults.

1557048630|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1RJIOMIW6VVYP]]I can't believe my eyes when I saw this books on the shelf at a local bookshop, two months earlier than its scheduled release date.<br /><br />Flipped a few pages, and saw the unique style of Nicolas Marlet, flipped back to the cover and found that Tracy Miller-Zarneke is the author and the movie's from Dreamworks. Those three names instantly reminded me of quality art book The Art of Kung Fu Panda. I'm glad to say that this book is as good and fun. By the way, Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois are the famed directors here.<br /><br />Inside the book are more than 350 development artwork, including early character designs, story sketches, and concept paintings. The books is divided into three parts, the dragons, vikings and the environment with stuff like props and houses. Discarded art and characters are also included, like Hiccup's mother - who can cook a mean dish with dragon meat. Accompanying the art are plenty of interesting quotes and commentary from the production staff.<br /><br />Nicolas Marlet and Simon Otto seem to be the lead character designers responsible for the concept art of the dragons and vikings, although a good amount of designs are actually from Nicolas Marlet. There's a wide range of wackiness and creativity to the drawings. The character digital paintings are great and the colours are really beautiful, kudos to Zhaoping Wei.<br /><br />The environment paintings from Pierre-Olivier Vincent, art director, are beautiful. This guy really knows how to draw scenic yet precarious backgrounds like sloping hilltops, snow-capped sea arches and Dragon island which is like an ice-cream cone with molten lava as topping. Not only that, his tranquil pieces are also spectacular, National Geographic-spectacular. He has created places you want to visit but probably not because one wrong step and you'll roll down the hill.<br /><br />There are even a few illustrations from Dominique Louis, who did some pastel concept art for Pixar. His using digital pastels now and there's no difference from his traditional work, I'm glad to say. The fun and stylised houses, statues, weapons, boats and other props are from Kirsten Kawamura and Mel Zwyer.<br /><br />It's a fantastic book showing the creative prowess of amazing artists. Highly recommended.<br /><br />-<br /><br />By the way, if you missed the \\"About the Author\\" section above, I have to mention it here again because Tracey Miller-Zarneke has authored some really great art books that you should check out.<br />- [[ASIN:1933784571 The Art of Kung Fu Panda]]<br />- [[ASIN:1423102657 The Art of Meet the Robinsons]]<br />- [[ASIN:193378489X The Art and Making of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]<br /><br />-<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog.

B002JIOQCO|4.0|This album comes after a so-called break-up. well,more bands need to break up,more often!They really came out swinging a huge hammer on this one.It from the start is decidedly harder and the fuzzy psycadelic stuff is even more matured.The previous album could be a bit sophmorish on some of the trippy parts but this record is definantly more aggressive. and its that in the good way.Great job,very good album!
B002YIHO7I|4.0|It has been a decade since Sade last recorded and released an album. Confirmed Sade fans will not be disappointed with the transition. There is a lot of the familiar Sade rythym that fans love, but there is a nuanced innovation to the tracks on this album. Sade accompanies herself with a throaty lower octave version accompanying her ethereal and relaxed familiar style.    Older fans will be rewarded by familiar Sade versions of evocative and pleasing poetry in the lyrics while new fans will appreciate the upbeat tempo and the evolutionary growth of a innovative and unique talent.    This is a splendid addition to the musical library of Sade fans and an excellent introduction for new fans who have yet to be exposed to this extraordinary talent. I highly recommend this album. John Amtsfield, Boyertown, PA
B001AEF6BI|5.0|If you have adollecents in your home you need to have this movie.Period.It was Hughes finest work as far as content and the interplay between the characters has went on for all eternity and went on with my children and goes on today!Hell,all 8th graders should be forced to watch this before entering high school!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie has increased my awareness of food quality and what exactly we are putting into our bodies. This movie has motivated me to choose my food more carefully, and educate myself on the origins of where my food comes from.     Highly recommended movie for those looking to improve their eating habits as well as those who want an in depth perspective on the American food supply.     This movie encourages the American consumer to choose organic and support local farms, all the while, not in an elitist or preachy way.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|What a fantastic return to home.Yes,we will always miss Layne.Will is a great fit though and Jerry,I feel,needs to understand how much he was a part of chains original recordings. When you here him talk about the past he doesnt seem to put so much emphasis on his contributions, or at least the importance of his input, but Black shows how much he was probably the driving force in Chains early coquest of music.Lets all realize the product was inturpreted and nashed upon and fed to you by Layne and they loved him like a brother, but by this album they all prove Chains can still do great things.Will Duvall, as stated earlier, is a great fit, also
B00319ECHE|5.0|Fear Factory is my favorite band so I was really anxious to get Mechanize. After some serious listening I've concluded it is a very strong metal album, especially if you compare it to some of the newer bands which, as one of the reviewers stated, make only nonsense noise. The sound quality is excellent and it is probably their heaviest album since SOANM. There are some minor issues though. First, some of Dino's riffs sound a little too thrashy (like Divine Heresy's Bringer of Plagues) - I like them better when they sound more mechanical or robotic or whatever that made FF sound so unique. Second, I wish the album was a bit longer. Again, these are just some minor issues and I still think this is an awesome album. I really like Burton's voice so everything he's in is good stuff for me (check City of Fire) but here he's heavier than ever - he seems reaaally pissed off when screaming in Mechanize. I hope they keep releasing albums for many years to come.    I've just edited my review because in reality I think Mechanize deserves 5 stars when you consider everything the band went through. Congratulations FF!
B000WQWPKA|3.0|The first time I watched this movie was back in 1997-1998. My first thought was, \\"wow what a good movie!\\"  All the explosion and the excitement makes this movie even more captivating. Will Smith did o.k. in this movie however I feel there was a lack of acting/ effort put out from this man. There was a lot of potentials. A quarter through the movie was interesting because viewers wonder what the humans will do to save themselves from alien destruction. From half way to the end of the movie, it was mostly humans vs. aliens, good vs. bad. All the major countries come together as allies to fight terror from out of space.  It gave you a nice feeling of patriotism, not for one's country but for mankind. I wouldn't say this is the best Will Smith film, but it's a fun film to check out.
B002XTBE6K|2.0|Sorry, Ms. Garai, this is almost a complete waste of time . . . Kate Beckinsale and Gwyneth Paltrow have said all that needs to be said.  This version interprets the heck out of this thing, and adds a lot of dialogue to clarify their interpretation while cutting much of Austen's (superior) dialogue .  Harriet's voice is grating, although they do develop her character more than some of the other versions.  Emma constantly echoes Gwyneth Paltrow's portrayal--not surprisingly.  I do like some of the points they make and some of the contrasts they draw: Emma's childhood fate, Miss Bates' poverty.  All in all, though, not worth it.  I would highly recommend either of the '97 versions over this.
B001W63DXC|5.0|After growing up with the fantastic memory of the world slavery tour,wich i was only able to view on video, being young and out of cash at that time,i can say that having been at one of these concerts was just the greatest day in my all life.. Iron maiden simply sounds just better than then,having now 3 guitars instead of just 2..<br />i was in monterrey,february 22nd 2008, and i have the happines to say that my favorite song from maiden of all time, and maybe the heavy metal song i have loved most in my all life,is wasted years.. i even cried when they played it. and now that precise song is included in the album,so how could i not have it?<br />i guess everyone that had the chance of living any date of the somewhere back in time tour will have the chance to get the same kind of feeling when listening to these album,so it's a completely positive strategy to have released it. iron maiden has always behaved as one of the most intelligent heavy metal band of all time,as proven by the tour,and everything they do..i still get chicken-skin every time i hear  the album, and if you were there, so will you... buy it!! and of course,the dvd too..
B002XMGGK6|1.0|I thought that this was a fairly good movie, but the ending sucked and ruined the whole movie for me.
B001FOR5XU|4.0|My sister and I recently did a literary quid pro quo - she read my favorite novel, Marilynne Robinson's Housekeeping, and I read one of her favorites - I Am Legend. Not being much of a horror fan and having already seen several films based on the story (which sis assures me are all totally off the mark), I'll admit I was a bit leery going in.<br /><br />But I've come to discover that this is so much more than a spooky tale of vampires/zombies. Matheson wrote this short novel in the midst of the Cold War and during the height of McCarthyism. In addition to the constant (albeit largely imagined) threat of communism, the status quo was beginning to be challenged by the burgeoning civil rights and feminist movements. The middle class suburban white male was feeling threatened and, in many ways, this book reads like a paranoid redneck's worst nightmare. After reading it, I'm extremely surprised that two of the most well-known film adaptations/interpretations (I Am Legend and Night of the Living Dead) starred African-American actors. That right there suggests to me that the filmmakers missed the point entirely.<br /><br />Robert Neville is the lone survivor of some sort of plague that has infected every other human on Earth. Some of the plague victims are living, some are un-dead, but they all come out at night to quench their thirst for human blood. During the day Neville roams the suburban California landscape dispatching the vampires as they sleep with hand carved wooden stakes. Every night, he barricades himself in his home while they cluster outside pounding on the walls and moaning his name. Typical horror story, right?<br /><br />But look a bit closer.<br /><br />Spread of the plague has been hastened by the fall-out from some vaguely referenced nuclear explosion(s). At one point, Neville himself ponders the demonization of the vampire race, likening them to minorities who \\"...are loathed because they are feared,\\" before mocking his own compassion toward them with, \\"Sure, sure...but you wouldn't want your sister to marry one.\\" He holds a particular hostility toward the women, mainly because he lusts for them, and his neighbor, Ben Cortman, the vampire who calls out to him by name, is a Jew. In a particularly creepy scenario near the end of the story, he describes the enjoyment he gets from hunting for the well-hidden Cortman each day. Not so funny, when you consider this was written less than ten years after the fall of the Third Reich. This is a man who spends his entire existence trying, literally, to beat back the alien hordes from his doorstep. Naturally, his battle is a futile one.<br /><br />Robert Neville is a man clinging to his carefully preserved little world even as he realizes that his time has come and gone. The Earth has been overrun by \\"the other\\" and he is no longer in charge.  He is now the minority...loathed because he is feared.n't want your sister to marry one.\\" He holds a particular hostility toward the women, mainly because he lusts for them, and his neighbor, Ben Cortman, the vampire who calls out to him by name, is a Jew.

0756404746|5.0|Absolutely loved this book, and I don't usually read fantasy, I prefer to read scifi.  Cannot friggin wait for the second book.
B00003CXC6|2.0|A rather wierd film with histrionic acting, exaggerated facial gestures, outbursts of creepy laughter and an obtuse philosophy.  Yes, I undestand the basic premise, but the execution itself is flawed.  Somewhat interesting insofar as dealing with Japanese customs and rituals with which most of us be might be unfamiliar.  The only real reason to view this film is that it's been deemed a \\"Classic\\"--so it's good to find out what all the fuss is about. And make up your own mind.
0618871713|5.0|I was browsing graphic novels and I wasn't even sure what this was about before I bought it, but the premise of it intrigued me. It pulled me in by the 2nd page, and it was one of those that I wanted to savor reading because it flowed so well, I could see myself finishing it in about a day or two. Alison Bechdel does a great job of conveying her life, not only with what's written, but the ink art as well. It was a pretty powerful story, and gave me some comparisons in my own life to compare to. It will definitely make you think about your home life in ways you haven't before.<br /><br />It's at times funny, enlightening, sad, and pretty deep throughout. This graphic novel has a lot to offer to anyone, and I will be recommending it to my friends. I loved it and it's is going to stay in my collection so I can read it again in a few years, and while I'm at it, look for something else she's written.

B002YIHO7I|5.0|It is November, workday, early morning. I have hit the snooze button twice. Turn the radio on with the remote, pull the blankets over my face. I hear the wind, the chimes, the horns, then the voice. I shoot upright stunned, I know that voice, but I have never heard this opening before IT IS Sade. I am on my feet at 5:12 am shivering as her voice rolls over me. It ends. Then it begins again from the top.  The DJ announces \\"Soldier of Love\\" and nothing more. I am up dressed and gone... Blues and Cool breathes again.
B001NLKSI4|3.0|interesting enough story although the telling of it was a little egotistical and at times left out the detail that would have made it better.
B000ZELISO|4.0|This was my first blu ray dvd that I bought.  I was surprised how much better the computer graphics looked vs a regular dvd on a regular dvd player.  If you want a dvd to test the difference between regular dvd/dvd player and a blu ray I would recommend using this movie.
B002TQKS14|5.0|a very well written book on the american diet. i havent been able to eat corn (or corn products) without thinking about the first section since.
B000QUUD60|3.0|I'm not the Elvis fan. My wife is. I never \\"got\\" him. But this is Elvis in Las Vegas, clowning with his buds, at the peak of his fame. My wife loved, loved, loved it. That's why I bought the DVD. According to my wife, Elvis is at his most gorgeous here. And I have to admit, seeing him in concert, he's a pretty impressive musician & a pretty impressive entertainer. Though it's supposed to be \\"candid Elvis,\\" he's always aware that the camera's on him, and you never feel that it's really natural. It's no \\"Hard Day's Night,\\" but, apparently, if your an Elvis fan, it doesn't really matter. As long as you can look at & hear the King, what else matters?
B002RSDW80|4.0|Very good movie, especially for foodies and fans of Julia Child. Meryl Streep is really amazing, she absolutely channels Julia.

0066620996|1.0|Collin's Good to Great is full of simplistic and moronic assumptions. E.g. All level 5 companies (the best) have leaders that make the company a Great Company even long after they leave the great companies they created. And level 4 companies cannot maintain their greatness after its great leader leaves. This is moronic thinking.    Here's a sports analogy to shed light on how stupid this concept of a level 5 company is: If a great NFL coach puts together a great sport organization and say wins five Super Bowls and then say three years after the coach retires that the team is no longer any good...then by Collin's definition this sports organization that one five Super Bowls in five years would not be considers a great organizaiton.    Anyway, by definition a best seller has to appeal to the intellect of the masses...people with average and below average intellects.  So, by definition only people with average or below average intellects would think this book is any good.    Read the review by H. James Madigan, \\"Not Good nor Great\\". He explains in detail why this book is soooo bad. Even some of the \\"masses\\" should be convinced by H. Jame Madigan's review that this book is very weak.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|great movie & story line for kids. i even enjoyed watching the movie with my kids
B001MW0J2O|4.0|Animal Collective has made a name for themselves with a sound that basically reflects their name.  Their albums are chaotic events, with each musician announcing their lyrics and thrashing at their instruments as if they were playing slightly different versions of the same song.  I was impressed by their goals, but in past albums I felt like it usually devolved into the musical equivalent of a riot, energetic, complex, but sometimes atonal and unformed.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0001J3VII Sung Tongs]] and [[ASIN:B000AMSRO4 Feels]] both had songs that I loved and played over and over (\\"The Purple Bottle,\\" \\"Did You See the Words?\\" and \\"leaf House\\" were my top three) but both records felt like they were bundles of bizarre jokes, only a handful of which I got.  Because of their tongue-in-cheek cacophony, I was never totally sold.<br /><br />This album, I'd been told over and over, was one of the best of 2009, and although I'd taken a pass on [[ASIN:B000UE64PG Strawberry Jam]], I decided to see what all those \\"Best Of\\" lists had been talking about with MPP.  What I discovered was that they were right; although Animal Collective hasn't discarded the playful energy of their sound, they have traded in their baffling weirdness for a more meaningful and touching eccentricity.<br /><br />The album plays out like one long romp through playgrounds and down rainy city alleys.  From the opening track -- \\"In the Flowers,\\" a blustery praise piece that starts with a slow burn -- it's clear that they've learned how to use just a little restraint to show twice as much heart.  Although a few of the songs border on cheesy digi-pop (\\"Summertime Clothes,\\" \\"Bluish,\\" and \\"My Girls\\"), their complex and infectious effervesence makes them stand out all the more.<br /><br />As in past albums, they make a lot of use of repetition, but just as you think they're going to stress the limits of the listener's patience, they wickedly alter the pace and pall of each song, keeping themselves and listeners on their tones.  It's very much an interactive album.<br /><br />It's still weird, and likely to confuse and turn off many people.  But their warmer and more heart-felt sound is certain to draw more curious ears than their past offerings did.  As lovely as it is loony, MPP finally shows the world what Animal Collective can do when they focus less on the animal and more on the collective.interactive album.

B002RVZV9K|4.0|You know the one I mean.  Edge and White are sitting there -- one a bonafide superstar guitar hero in his own right, and the other a new kid on the rise, representing the newest wave.  But both, regardless of their obvious age differences, are once again 15-year-old kids, listening to music way past their bedtime, sitting in mesmerized awe, thinking \\"I never thought I'd ever get to see THIS, 2 feet in front of my face\\" -- as Mr. James Page, in whose presence they both suddenly, terrifyingly realize they are MOST unworthy, lets loose with \\"Whole Lotta Love\\".  At that moment, Edge, White, you, and I are equals -- mere mortals in the presence of a god.
0439023491|5.0|**Contains Minor Spoilers if you haven't read Book 1**<br /><br />The Hunger Games enter their 75th round and everyone in Panem is looking forward to the special celebrations that occur every 25 years. This year, Katniss and Peeta along with their mentor are seen as possible mentors for the future tributes of district 12. For the meantime, however, they are obliged to go on a tour of all the districts as part of their Victory Tour. And as they start their tour, rumors of rebels in several districts make their way to the victors.<br /><br />Katniss's quick thinking in the previous hunger games managed to save both her and Peeta's lives. The people of Panem fell in love with the couple, and celebrated their victory. The government however, saw this as a deliberate act of rebellion because only one survivor should have been allowed to live. Katniss recognizes the threat she and her family are under and tries to follow the rules from now on, but things don't always happen as planned.<br /><br />When President Snow announces that for the 75th round each district would have to choose a tribute from the already existing pool of victors, Katniss knows she'd be facing imminent death disguised as The Hunger Games, since Katniss is the only female victor from district 12. Peeta is also chosen and the government's plan backfires as the people of Panem show their displeasure.<br /><br />A fast, interesting read that picks up where book 1 ends. I can't wait for the third to come out, and I hope it's just as good.
0307588335|5.0|This book was very interesting to read and not only provided great insight into the collapse at Lehman, but also into the complicated derivatives markets.  It covered such topics as CDO'S, CLO'S, and other financial instruments that are misunderstood by many participants in the markets.  A great read.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|First, I really like alternate history and alternate versions of classic storie, so this flick is right up the middle. I enjoyed the changes in character, like Spock in love, that will present interesting new situations as this version unfolds over the next several (I hope!!!) sequels.

0679781307|4.0|After reading any story, I always think: What was I supposed to take away from this? In the end I think this was a story about a woman who really had no sense of right and wrong.  She showed no remorse for sending Jews to their death then she shows no remorse in seducing a 15 year old boy.  She was a totally selfish woman-she learned from him, she took from him and ultimately he received nothing valuable in return.  But of course, in real life, things like this can happen.  I like books that make me think, and this one did.

B002HT17RC|4.0|As with other works of his, Orwell has a strong reformist purpose with this book, and in this instance, the topic under consideration is urban poverty, in its various gradations: unemployed and hungry, employed but stupefied by toil, and finally, homeless, or tramping, as the term was at the time. In each section, his the autobiographically-based protagonist has a number of colorful experiences and misadventures, which are then analyzed and remarked upon with Orwell's characteristic society-skewering and thought-provoking perspective.<br /><br />In the first section of the book, the narrator is minimally and then unemployed, dodging his landlady, skipping meals, and living from pawnshop to mouth. I've encountered other descriptions of being hungry in literature, of course, but Orwell dwells on it here and the unrelieved tedium, frustration, and discomfort that such a life entails, illustrating it with observations such as this: \\"Hunger reduces on to an utterly spineless, brainless condition, more like the aftereffects of influenza than anything else.\\" Reading this made me both grateful that I've never had to go through such hunger, yet also slightly curious to see how bad it is for myself.<br /><br />In the second section, the narrator finds work as a plongeur, or dishwasher, at a fine Paris hotel. To anyone who has worked in food service (as a waiter, caterer, dishwasher, or the like), it will be both humorous and sad how little has changed in 70 years; to anyone who hasn't, it will be an eye-opening look at what goes on behind the scenes at restaurants and hotels. Looking back on 19-hour catering jobs, I can well relate to Orwell's observation that \\"Work in the hotel taught me the true value of sleep, just as being hungry had taught me the true value of food.\\" And in that light, this section of the book reinforced my opinion that ideally everyone would have to do some service job sometime in their lives, both so they could sympathize forever after with those who later serve them, and for the intrinsically valuable lessons therein.<br /><br />In the third and longest section, the narrator returns from Paris to England, and spends a lot of time tramping among the work houses, hostels, and other refuges of the homeless and vagrant. While he certainly had some harsh words about the dehumanizing effect of mindless drudgery like that of the plongeur, he saves his harshest criticism for his home country and the laws governing and conditions pertaining to the homeless. He calls out the hypocrisy of those who consider begging to be any different than any other profession, and regarding the physical and mental degradation of a fellow tramp, he comments \\"He had lived on this filthy imitation of food till his own mind and body were compounded of inferior stuff.\\" Living in the Bay Area, with its substantial homeless population, Orwell's book has prompted some serious reflection.m, and for the intrinsically valuable lessons therein.

B000URDEB0|5.0|I'm a long-time fan of progressive rock, but only discovered Nightwish yesterday, and I'm sorry it took me so long to find them. At 52 I'm just getting into metal music (is this part of my mid life \\"crisis\\", along with my starting to play Dungeons & Dragons?) but this powerful album instantly drew me in. For years Alan Parsons Project, Yes, Renaissance, Rick Wakeman, and other prog-rock music classics were my faithful resources, but the well seemed to run pretty dry long ago.    My recent discovery of prog-metal in general and Nightwish in particular has re-ignited my love of this genre. It's soaring, it's dramatic, it's moody, it's exhilarating. And since \\"Dark Passion Play\\" was my first exposure to Nightwish, I had no expectation about Anette's succession as lead female vocalist. I think she is outstanding. The blend of haunting melodies, power chords, and tsunami vocals blew me back in my chair. In the car -- despite the near-zero temperature -- I had to roll the windows down to let the world share in the rush.    I'm looking forward to further prospecting in the prog-metal genre, though in finding Nightwish I've already struck gold and discovered a sizable nugget in \\"Dark Passion Play\\".

B000FP2OPY|3.0|I purchased a set of DVD's for the first season of Supernatural as a gift for Christmas.  When the DVD's were played, #2 (out of 6) played for about 10 minutes and then quit.  There is a huge scratch on the back of it.  I purchased the 'new' set instead of a used set.  According to Amazon's return policy, since the plastic wrap is removed, then I can only get half of the return price.  I searched the website and it stated that if you had any problems, then call the customer service number.  I looked all over and could not find the number.  I understand they are trying to protect themselves from people copying DVDs and then returning them.  However, their policy screws the folks that actually have a faulty product. I will try looking for the number 1 more time.  I would recommend to anyone wanting to buy a set of DVDs to buy them from a local supplier that would give easier and better 'recourse' for solutions to problems.
0307408833|4.0|When I had the cupcakes at the bakery -- my body devoured them. They were yummy AND nutritious and my whole being knew/felt it!    My copy of the cookbook reads \\"vegan, (mostly) gluten-free, and (mostly) sugar-free\\" so I don't see why others are commenting on the fact that not all of the recipes are not gluten-free.    That being said, I've made the chocolate and red velvet cupcakes -- and they are yummy! I beat the batter with a wire wisk and have no issues with consistency.     The vanilla frosting doesn't tastes like I remember at the bakery, but it's good. It also doesn't come out bright white. I beat that too with a wire wisk and have no issues with consistency.    Yes, the items are costly -- that's because sugar and flour is relatively cheap. And, that's why you'll find enriched flours and sugar in many foods -- they are cheap fillers with no nutritional value.
B00275EGWY|5.0|I was even more impressed how fast I received DVD.  Great quality and great price and most of all Great movie.  I would recommend amazon to anyone.  Look forward to many future purchases.
0452289963|5.0|Not what I would term 'an easy read', but a worthwhile one.  I had to go over chapters more than once to think and absorb the meaning at times.  The message of the book makes perfect sense to me and gives the reader a new way to look at life, even those hard to look at corners like death.   It is leaving the ego behind and really living and sharing and having compassion for others.  It talks of us being all connected and a part of the universe.  An excellent philosophy to adopt.
1932073221|5.0|I have probably close to 100 similar books in my personal library, but feel this is the greatest one yet.  The title may be misleading because it's valuable information, exercises, and playsheets go FAR beyond creating money.  I have been studying the laws of attraction and manifesting for awhile now and this book gives background, but also takes the reader through hands-on suggestions.  It is much more than mere pages of information.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|What a wonderful movie.  I like how it turns into a feel-good flick, but not until the very end.  Well done IMO
0894803123|5.0|I have made several recipes from this book with my kitchenaid mixer & the ice cream attachment.  Every recipe that I have made has been delicious!!!!  Every one from my grandparents down to my little brother love the ice cream that I have made.  I also like that it doesn't call for a lot (sometimes none) of egg yolks.  Definitely a must have for anyone who has an ice cream maker!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|What a treasure. I great gift for West Wing fans, I love all the extras includes comments from former presidents and other political leaders. It's great to watch the series in order and see the development. If you are or know a West Wing fan or want someone to understand how our government works this is the gift for you. Best money I've spent in a long time.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|Exciting and well worth watching.  Subtle message is to help one view others with tolerance and acceptance.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Price is a bit high but worth it! Need to come out with a bluetooth version
B002L6I9Z4|4.0|I purchased this camera for my 7 yr old son for Christmas.  It is very easy to use and actually takes great photos.  I chose this camera because it didn't look like a toddler device, but more durable than a traditional camera.  I highly recommend this for a first camera for ages 6 to 9 year olds.  If you choose this item you will not be disappointed
B002QGUFWE|1.0|I don't want to buy an edited cd...What's the point in that? It ruins the song and makes it sound horrible.
B002SJIO5E|1.0|On the movie: Please rent this blu-ray movie before you made your purchase. I am a die hard Sci Fic fan since don't know when. This movie for me is unbearable. I forced myself to finish this movie simply because I purchased it with my hard earn money.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|Heck, I am not into scary movies to begin with.  I saw the commercials for this and never had the desire to see it.  My new roommate handed it to me with big eyes, telling me she 'believes in this kinda stuff.'  Well I had some things to do today but had a little stress headache, so I decided to put them off and chill out with the movie.      I should have done the work...  I feel like I wasted time I could have used to do ANYTHING more important.      To begin with, I kept waiting for something really terrifying to happen.  It never did.      2nd - I wanted to like Micah.  You know, the devoted boyfriend.  But he really got on my nerves as the movie wore on.  First he let his girlfriend order him about like a child, and I found myself thinking, \\"He needs to grow a pair.\\"  Second, had any of this been legit or real, how realistic is it that he would 'challenge' the entity as he did.  Yelling out to it that it can't come in to 'his house' and blah blah blah.  Like a demon would care.  Like anyone in that situation would think they could challenge one.  A bit strong with the testosterone flow.      The psychic guy was a joke.      I didn't like the Blair Witch either, but it had some legitimately tense scenes.  This one was such a disappointment.
B001BVOSD2|1.0|Avoid this CD unless you enjoy poorly arranged synthesizer music.  This is one of those releases that appears to be a \\"greatest hits\\" of sorts, until you notice that it is not performed by the original artist.  Some of those types of releases are at least tolerable; this one is terrible.  First, it is all synthesized.  Second, the arrangements aren't even accurate.  I know the Star Wars theme like the back of my hand, and this \\"artist\\" manages to mangle it worse than a sixth-grade school band.  I actually have a copy that I was going to sell, until I listened to it.  No one should be subjected to this kind of torture.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Another great read by Dan Brown.  LOST SYMBOL has a well developed plot with strong character development.  Brown's books have always been able to grab me and pull me into the plot.  LOST SYMBOL was a gift to me, but before I began reading it I ordered it for my kindle---much easier to handle and carry around than the hard bound copy!  I am looking forward to the next Dan Brown book!
B0002JJBZY|5.0|I bought this as a gift to share and was delighted. I am a fan of the original show, with all its quirks and bad effects. This edition preserves them all as I first saw them. The packaging is interesting and will certainly keep your dvds safe.    Highly recommended.
B002KREVE2|5.0|As always, I am more than satisfied with this Leonard Cohen product.  It's nice to see him young again, and I'm thankful that the DVD and CD became available from that time.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I love collecting Supernatural seasons, each episode just gets better and better. I definitely recommend this but of course after you watch the first season. Three words to sum this DVD up is funny, suspenseful and brilliant.
B002N8A14M|3.0|The case doesn't look quite as pretty as depicted, but looks alright so far as hard cases go. There are a couple of functional problems: it's difficult to plug the headphones into the jack, and it's a bit annoying to use the control button because the hard plastic around it gets in the way of your fingers. Other than that, it's nice to have a case with a built in clip, and the arm band is a nice extra (though I would have preferred to just buy the case without it)    After a few months of using this cover, the face of the cover is all scratched up, making it difficult to see the ipod screen. I expected more from such a pricey cover!
1594488878|3.0|A little depressing with not enough of a satisfying ending for me, this book was entertaining at times but after seeing An Education I know Hornby can do better...His love and knowledge of music is once again on display, like in High Fidelity, although this one presents an aging rocker and two depressed people who lives interwine with his...Not my favorite Horny book...
0316096199|5.0|This book definitely needs a mature audience to handle. It describes in a lot of detail the rape of Alice Sebold and all of the court proceedings that followed. As having to deal with this in my own life, she provides gems of knowledge that really can only be learned from experiencing this type of event and it shows true genuine understanding of this problem. She really provides a lot of experiences that are personal but important because many rape victims will have to go through it (having people disbelieve her, feeling detached, changing in the eyes of others, the idea of saving herself or going unsaved). The book also proves that some rape cases can be solved in a court room but subtly reminds the reader that it usually isn't that way (with the other parts of her story) which is important to remember. I also feel that Sebold goes into details of pain that comes from rape that has nothing to do with the action, such as her relationships with others and how others sometimes just can't stand the idea of being around someone who has experienced such a terrible thing. Sebold discusses what no one really wants to; that sometimes as a society, people don't want to be near those who have suffered terrible events for some unknown reason. The only thing that I feel this book is lacking is explaining more about how she eventually healed. She mentions she did and it takes a long time for her, but the details aren't as descriptive as the beginning. I feel she discusses more the trauma than the healing (which is ironic given what she does write about in reference to the healing) however I do feel that is something maybe too personal to share so I can understand the lack of details. All in all, I feel it is a great book to help out as therapy, to help understand what it might be like, and just in all to read about what people want to forget about how life can be.
0307408833|5.0|I believe that this book is well-written and easy to read.  It's very hard to find baked goods or recipes that are both gluten-free and vegan.  I attempted to make the Banana Chocolate Chip Bread and was thrilled with the results.  I did find that I needed to adjust the baking time, but it tasted great.  I also appreciated the explanation of the various ingrediants (such as coconut oil), which let me know more about the benefits of them.  It's not only a great book for someone living a gluten-free or vegan lifestyle, but also for those looking to experiment with new ingrediants (coconut oil, agave nectar, alternative flours).<br /><br />Now if Babycakes NYC could just publish their recipe for their gluten free jelly donuts!
B000ZELISO|4.0|I was extremely pleased with this purchase.  The fact that it contained blue ray, DVD and downloadable movies was very important.  I had seen the movie previously so I knew what was coming.  All of the formats work well.    Yours Milt
B002P5XXR0|5.0|James Horner has done it again. I find myself replaying movie scenes in my head when listening to the soundtrack. I can honestly say that this score is very moving and I feel several emotions when listening to this fine piece of work. I firmly believe that the score is what \\"MAKES\\" a movie. As corny as it may sound, you feel emotions and appreciate the detail of music and what it brings to any film. I am so glad I own this soundtrack. I hope there's a second one in the works (like with Titanic & Braveheart).
B002WY65VU|5.0|ZOMBIELAND is the best zombie movie in a long time.  It's witty, gory, inventive and very funny at times.  Woody Harrelson and Jessie Eisenberg are perfect as the meek loner and the swaggering butt-kicker.  Add Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin as conniving sisters plus a great cameo playing himself and you have the ingredients for an original zombie flick.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|The movie was so heartwarming and upbeat. I loved the interaction between the old and young. I watched it twice and cried each time. I will watch it again and again.
0810982862|5.0|Great book, very nice format, good paper    Could be more graphic and less text though
0439023483|5.0|I love this book. It is action packed, and it has great character development. I am on the edge of my seat for the final installment. I try to get every single one of my students who asks for a reading recommendation to read this book.

B000ETQR3Q|5.0|My granson has totally enjoyed this toy. He wanted it for Christmas and his friends and he play with it daily. It's durable with the exception of the bullets and they can get messed up \\"if not taken care of\\" because they are just sponges. The price is reasonable too. It's good safe fun.
B00319ECC4|4.0|No doubt that when Fear Factory founder Dino Cazares was booted from the band years ago that the group's last 2 CDs were of mixed results. 'Archetype' the first one without Dino, was REALLY GOOD & proved that the remaining members didn't need him. Unfortunately the album that followed, 'Transgression' was a Fear Factory which left fans wondering \\"what the??\\" Not that it was a bad album, it just didn't pull you in like most of the band's previous works. Well now that Dino & Burton C. Bell are reunited with Byron Stroud on bass & the drum destroyer Gene Hoglan, Fear Factory is back with it's trademark metal artillery that fans can't get enough of!! There's really no need to expound but imagine 'Demanufacture' with a touch of 'Obsolete' & you'll get the point! Many great tracks on here but \\"Industrial Discipline\\" is a destined classic, then you have the brutal \\"Fear Campaign\\" & \\"Controlled Demolition,\\" the ominous \\"Christploitation\\" & \\"Oxidizer,\\"  & the \\"Resurrection\\"-like  \\"Final Exit.\\" Excellent return to form for a band which seemed lost!

B000024C7W|3.0|One can hear the sound of Wonder wondering what he's doing when the goofball experimentation gets too heavy, though thankfully this interesting mistake is simply an intriguing off-ramp; in lesser hands most of this would sound far worse then it does.

B00001OH7M|2.0|2 1/2      One of the few artists whose consistencies can't seen to generate emotionally resonant output for me, this album, like many I have, has all its merit in a few choice songs and otherwise plagued by mechanized intelligence.

B002Q4U9YU|5.0|To all of you out there that knew in your hearts all along who Michael was, I too knew. Seeing him in \\"This Is It\\" saddened me that I would never have a chance to share in seeing him live. Thank you to whomever decided \\"This Is It\\" had to be given to the world. I will cherish it and be reassured in knowing one day I will see him. What a loss we have all had in his leaving this world.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Though purchased for someone else and not having seen it myself, everyone I know who has seen this film found it to be simply excellent. There is a fair amount of graphic violence, however, it is a war film. Certainly not for children or the faint of heart.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I was in 2 minds about this book.  I thought it came out too fast after the others, so I did have lower expectations.  But it delivered the story, and did carry me along so I did not put it down until done.  It did seem lengthy and repetitive at times.  I almost felt I needed to know Washington, so in some ways the detailed directions were a hindrance as I did not know the places mentioned in relation to each other, but I felt the way he kept detailing the geography was for our benefit. My purpose in reading novels is to be taken somewhere else and not to worry too much about the literature of it all, although it is a bonus if that is good too.  This was meant to be an exciting read and that's about it.
B000EPR7NE|4.0|I don't usually purchase soundtracks, but the DaVinci Code soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is a great collection. My only issue is the CD should have had tracks adjusted for softness from when used as background in the film, as several tracks are simply too soft when just listening for the music.
B000001F45|5.0|I had this album on vinyl many years ago, so was excited to find it on CD, didn't know if I would still enjoy this music or if it was a silly phase I went through in my youth, but HELL NO it still rocks.
0060920084|1.0|I couldn't get past the first few pages and wish I had taken the time to read the reviews of this mean spirited, pompous, derogatory spew from this writer before spending my money.  With the daily partisan hatred being flung from the halls of Congress, I didn't need to read it when I was trying to \\"unwind\\" with what was falsely marketed as a \\"hilarious account of one man's rediscovery of America.\\"  Hilarious??  Rediscovery of America??  Nothing funny about it.  Go back to England, Mr. Bryson!
B0030BOCEG|5.0|Screamworks: Love In Theory And Practice. To me, I love all of HIM's albums. Listening to this one, it has that 80's vibe to it, and let's face it, at heart most of us love the 80's. It also keeps the vibe going though from previous HIM album's. Ville's voice is as great as always, singing us those love songs. Linde has great solo's on this album. This album shows how they have grown as a band and developed new sounds to be successful. Ville writes about what basically everyone goes through at some point in life, and he makes it very melodic and great to listen to. Listening to Disarm Me (With Your Loneliness) over and over again and Acousit Funeral (For Love In Limbo. Great songs just like the rest of the album. Those two are just my favorite. Anybody who is a fan of great music should definitely pick up this album and listen to it. It is well worth it.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|\\"Castle\\" is an extrememly entertaining series and a pleasure to watch.  Nathan Fillion plays Richard Castle, a best-selling mystery author.  Through his friendship with the Mayor, he gets to team up with NY detective Kate Beckett and help her solve the various homicides that come their way.  Fillion who was terrific on the prematurely-cancelled \\"Firefly\\" is just as good here.  However it is Stana Katic as detective Beckett who really steals the show.  I had never seen this Canadian actress before, (except for a brief appearance at the conclusion of the Bond flick \\"Quantum of Solace,\\") but she is both likeable and sympthetic as the put-upon homicide detective.  She is tall, beautiful and moves like she must have done some modeling.  She and Fillion work well together.  They get great support from the other two male homicide detectives that assist them and are there for basically comic-relief.  Susan Sullivan also steals most scenes as the tart-tongued mother of \\"Castle,\\" a former Broadway star who lives with him and his precocious teenage daughter.  The daughter is excellently played by Molly Quinn, who among other things has the most beautiful blue eyes I've seen.  This is a great show with wonderful dialogue, a terrific cast and great scripts.  If you want an hour of sophisticated entertainment, you should watch it.  The DVD set of season one includes bloopers and an interview with legendary TV producer and writer Stephen J. Cannell, who, among many other shows, produced \\"The Rockford Files,\\" a classic series very similar to this one.
006135323X|3.0|This book is an entertaining and thought provoking look at behavioral economics - related to, but much better than Buyology. Although some will quibble that the tests were not as scientific as they could have been, in my opinion, this did not take away from the overall theme of the book. One criticism I found valid was that of the author's knee-jerk reaction to socialist solutions for the ills discovered in his studies. It makes you wonder if he paid attention to his own research - why expect humans in government to be any more rational than the test subjects?<br /><br />In one interesting chapter, after a few tests where the author determines that people were less likely to cheat after reading the ten commandments, he muses in bewilderment over what happened to the professional standards in so many walks of life, particularly the legal profession. Lawyers have turned into complete dishonest jerks, in spite of a code of ethics. Attorneys in America have awful reputations and the code reads as if it speaks of another line of work.<br /><br />He wonders aloud what went wrong and what can be done. For this example, demographic trends offer helpful insights. When the code of ethics for lawyers was founded, the profession was made up mostly of White Anglo-Saxon Protestants, since after all that was the ethnic makeup of America as well as the source of the legal code itself. Fast forward a hundred years, and the ethnic makeup of the country has changed, radically in some areas. The legal profession went from a place were Jewish lawyers operated at the fringes to one where they flourish and excel in the profession. This was pointed out in Gladwell's book \\"Outliers,\\" where he noted that Jewish lawyers would take cases that the WASPS thought to be unsavory, unethical and bad for their reputations (mergers, in particular). This observation was seen as a positive by Gladwell, but Ariely did not explore the demographic shift as it may relate to the change in reputation of lawyers, for better or worse (i.e., nobody ever complains that THEIR lawyer is Jewish).<br /><br />Regardless of what you may make of the experiments in this book, you don't have to like the authors love of big government or his hopelessly academic and unrealistic 'solutions' to appreciate the nature of the book and its value. It is worth a read.r worse (i.e., nobody ever complains that THEIR lawyer is Jewish).     Regardless of what you may make of the experiments in this book, you don't have to like the authors love of big government or his hopelessly academic and unrealistic 'solutions' to appreciate the nature of the book and its value. It is worth a read.
0847830942|5.0|The photography is stunning and the history well-written and concise.  This book is a celebration of the beauty of bicycling.  There is one horrifically ironic twist - a book about the heights of craftsmanship printed in China!  Unfortunately, that shows in the poor quality binding of the book.  The content makes up for it, though.  You will start combing Craigslist to see what treasures might be out there.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|Finally, I can confirm (with a picture, see my image above) that the Blu-ray version of Let the Right One In has the theatrical subtitles. I purchased this from Amazon on 2/5/10, and it was shipped from the Coffeville, KS distribution center.  I hope this info is helpful to all of you who love the movie, but were hesitant to purchase the blu-ray for this reason.
B00013RC8O|5.0|This is truly a state of the art road movie of the early seventies.  Friends of old American muscle cars will love it and hate it in the end, when the Charger gets distroyed. Fans will also notice that Dodge was the overall sponsor. Most of all other cars are Dodge as well.  The typical scenes and camera movements of the 70ties are classic.    Sure , the film is loosing some tension in the end of the second third, but still worth to watch for enthusiasts. Lean back and enjoy to go back in time...
0743297334|3.0|Although Hemingway does not follow a specific path or point, it is somewhat evident that he is trying to challenge classic characters' perfect lives, and to describe life as it is realistically; jumbled and disorderly.   The Sun Also Rises is a representation of the post-World War I world of high-class scholars and women drinking and loving their way through Europe. Hemingway's description of Spain (unlike Paris), is praise-worthy. His contrasts between country and city, calm and fiesta, are concise and beautiful and certainly picturesque. His fiesta was somewhat dragged out, as is most of his book, but the depictions are fascinating to one's imagination and certainly leaves room for interpretation. The crowds of dancers and bulls and the massive amphitheater all leave the reader with a new impression of Pamplona's novelty.   Frustrating as Hemingway can become, he does bring the most important point of the story to an unfinished halt, rather than giving a concise happy ending or great loss of love. This contradicts most books and gives him a mysterious edge, creating an intriguing continuous plot that lets the reader create their own preferred ending. Without such endings, books become disillusions of life as we know it. Ernest Hemingway is gifted and unique, but it is easy to get lost in the way his mind thinks.
B002M2NA4C|5.0|Ryuichi Sakamoto reasserts why he is a major international talent that knows no bounds. Assertively melodic and constantly creative, he has continued to both push forward in the studio [\\"Out of Noise\\"] and relax in his performance environment [\\"Playing the Piano\\"].

038533348X|4.0|The end of the world has always been a difficult topic for discussion, probably because there is no saying when or how it will take place.  In 'Cat's Cradle\\" by Kurt Vonnegut, it is a topic that keeps coming up.  And if you are at all familiar with Vonnegut's dark humor, you would not be surprised.  The cause? Religion verses science.   It starts when the main character, John Hoosier (who is telling this story in the first person) is researching for a book to be called \\"The Day the World Ended,\\" about Dr. Felix Hoenikker, the man behind the atomic bomb.  This sparks a fascination, and leads him to contact this late scientist's children.    This book is full or random coincidences that seem to make no sense when you are reading it, but they all come together in the end.  All the characters, seeming slightly exaggerated, are not at all what you would expect.  There is a radical religious figure, Bokonon, and a Minister of science, Frank, who are all thrown together with ICE-NINE, a chemical that freezes everything upon contact.  The world ends when they are all on San Lorenzo, a made up island with a murderous dictator. It is very fun and also interesting.
B000M3452Y|5.0|Albums like Sound of Silver shouldn't be made anymore.  Listeners of the indie generation lost a feel a while ago for a great straight-through album, even one composed of universally well made songs.  Sound of Silver, though, doesn't remind me of other indie albums, despite its love of the modern-techno dance beats of the reinvented 80s-sound that's permeated indie music the last few years.  Instead, it reminds me of the Stones' Let It Bleed or the Who's Who's Next for a new generation.  Almost monolithically focused on the pains and pangs of aging and accepting adulthood, Sound of Silver is the type of album that forges an idea and pushes it so compulsively from one song to the next, you're almost immediately aware that you're in the type of album you never hear anymore - yet sonically, it's so advanced and up to the moment, lyrically so pointed and clever, it could only be made right now.  \\"Get Innocuous,\\" its 7 minute opener plunges you into beats so all-encompassing you don't notice what it seems to really, lyrically, be talking about - a fight to keep yourself from getting old.  That theme pops up again and again - from the loss that clouds \\"Someone Great\\" to the pounding, brilliant manifesto \\"All My Friends\\" that separates the album into two.  What are you to make of, say, \\"Sound of Silver\\" that has exactly one line (\\"Sound of silver talk to me/ makes you want to feel like a teenager/ until you remember the feelings of a real live emotional teenager/ then you think again\\") plunged into an absolute techno maelstrom?  That you're happy to be a little older and wiser and more stable, and still capable of dancing all night.  If any theme deserved a great album, it's that one, and it found its home.
0312305060|4.0|This book reveals the complicated yet common thought processes of everyday people. It unveils the private struggles everyone goes through every day in their head, a basic conversation and battle between every level of the subconscious. Every has questioned their past decisions or suicide (however tentatively) at some point. This novel shoves these thoughts into the audience; leaving it contemplating regret as they watch the characters do their best to survive. Personally, I loved this book and connected with each character immensely because of how frightening and standard their thoughts are. Laura especially made me fear for the future I'm creating for myself and made me wonder if I should be doing things differently so I don't end up trapped and desperate. Clarissa's character was the least likeable to me. It's unnerving and unrealistic that she would let Richard live alone. She spends most of the time thinking about him and claims to know him better than anyone and yet is completely surprised to find a terminal man living in his own filth that has been driven insane by a deteriorating brain committing suicide. It was pretty obvious to me that he was horrifically depressed and shouldn't be left to his own devices within a few sentences of meeting him. Besides this irritating fact this book was incredible and unsettlingly hammers how common it is to regret.
0439882826|5.0|This is such a great pop-up book.  The detail is impressive and there are even real glowing light sabers that pop out of one page.  I think it would be a great gift for older children who are into Star Wars.  Like any pop-up book you really have to be careful about opening the pages and closing them carefully.  It's really easy to hyper-extend the pages or close them too quickly causing part of the construction to catch.  I think this book is a great value and a unique item for a Star wars fan.
B000EGDAI4|5.0|About the flaw in Track 4 \\"Moritat\\":  It's not a defect in the CD, and it's not a skip in the master, either.  It's distortion.  Shortly before the distortion there's a drop-out in the tape.  I checked this track on the Prestige Profiles Sonny Rollins release, and the distortion isn't present on that version.<br /><br />Bear in mind this album was recorded in 1956.  If you listen to these old jazz albums with high-quality headphones, you'll find the tapes have all sorts of flaws.  I was listening to a track on a Grant Green album that had some strange ping-pong dropouts, making me wonder if it would get through the song.  It did, but barely.<br /><br />How the tapes were stored is very important.  This remastering was done in 2006, 50 years after Rollins laid down the tracks.  I'm not an LP enthusiast, but I think the original LP, mastered when the tapes were fresh, would sound better than digital mastering, regardless of the care that went into remastering.  Using original master tapes of older material might not always be the best decision in terms of sound quality.  The engineers should pick the best sounding tape of the track, not necessarily the master.  A later generation tape could sound better and be in better condition than the original master tapes.<br /><br />As far as the music is concerned, Rollins, Flanagan, Watkins, and Roach were masters of their art.  This is one of the most significant jazz recordings of the 1950s, and RVG did the best he could.  There's a reason collectors pay high prices for original LPs.  We're lucky to have as much of this stuff as we do.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|This sweeper is great!  Love how it gets in the corners and swivels.  It picks up messes with ease.  Too bad the battery stinks.  It only takes one time of over charging to make it virtually useless.  30 second run time and it starts dying.  Just too inconvenient to have to watch the clock in  order to charge it up just right.  (have purchased replacement batteries, same deal)
B002SJIO5E|1.0|i am a HUGE sci-fi fan but this movie SUCKED!  The directors tried to make it documentary style but the interviews and filming comes off feeling like a bad rendition of 'the office'.  Half of the movie consists of the main character (the south african version of the guy from 'the office') running around screaming 'f@#$' and shooting unrealistic guns at walls and aliens.  Brainless plot, action and dialogue. At the end of the movie I felt sick from the nausea inducing camera work and the overall disgustingness of the film.  And don't be fooled that this movie attacks apartheid, it is actually trying to explain WHY and HOW EASY the white south africans subjugated the blacks.  In the film we see blacks screaming for the aliens to be locked up and you can sense the white south african director smiling and saying, 'see, they want to lock up the dirty, disgusting, dangerous, scum as well!!'<br />Overall, a disgusting, tasteless, moronic movie that will leave you sick to your stomach.  Unless of course, you are the average imbecile who is desensitized to all of the violence and sadomasochism of our sorry 'culture' and enjoys GUNS GUNS AND MORE GUNS!!  (I actually saw a jackass family take their toddlers in to see this trash).  It bothers me to no end that this is under the sci-fi banner.
B001TD1XWG|1.0|Wayne's rap is deeply subjective, but this production turns him into  something else, not himself. Depersonalizing the personal. If this had  originally been released as a natural-sounding recording, and -then-, re-done later by some techno crew, it might make sense. As is, it's a derivative version of a project that never existed in it's primary form. Perhaps this is the product of all the pot Wayne smokes. Perhaps he's been distracted by his imminent imprisonment, and left production in the wrong hands. Either way, uh-uh.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I'm a long time Sade fan going back to when I was a wee lad who couldn't stop listening to DIAMOND LIFE.  I loved the jazzy blue grooves, and thought the singer was hypnotic in her delivery of meditations on love gone wrong and right.  SOLDIER OF LOVE continues the tradition of Sade, being a low key very jazzy affair that won't surprise fans.  It should please them though!  The title track is a little harder than what has come before, but the rest of the songs sound like what you expect from Sade.  There seems to be a little more reggae in here, but other than that you could play \\"Smooth Operator\\" right after any one of them and not miss a beat.  Great stuff!
B002OB9KPE|5.0|I was elated when I saw that Transatlantic was reforming for a new album, and they do not disappoint.  The bonus disc is passable, but the Whirlwind suite is their best music.  Pick this up, you'll be glad you did.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|This was a gift for my boyfriend for his birthday.  He said he absolutely loves these remastered CD's.  I debated back and forth on stereo vs. mono and it's really a personal choice.  I picked stereo and luckily I picked correctly!
B000QQFKYE|5.0|I was at first shocked when I was hearing and reading from Lynch fans negative feedback. It took me a while to understand what had turned so many otherwise open-minded viewers off. This film, though thematically most linked to Mullholland Drive, is stylistically a culmination of what has attracted Lynch fans all along. Take Lost Highway, with the inexplicably changing 'incarnations' and the two women played by the same actress. And at how many levels is Laura Dern playing her role? It would actually be quite a task to periodize the manifestations of Laura Dern's shifting realities and identities, yet there is a cohesive thread. As for a read? Well I don't presume any Lynch fan wants to be able to walk away with some cliched abstraction that is supposed to be the meaning of the movie. I do not find the movie any harder to engage than Eraserhead. In fact, I find Inland Empire much easier to engage. However, Laura Dern's descent is quick, and one would be hard pressed to convince me that it is not a descent. To where does she descend? Where else but that most feared place of psychic horror that despite our 'enlightened' sensibilities, we cannot brush aside.<br /><br />In short, two things make this film 'hard' to watch, both of which depend upon the viewer: 1. the thematic, emotional, and visual darkness of the film. 2. the realities within realities within realities. But it's like I wrote about Eraserhead: Lynch is by far the closest thing we've got to a filmaker-poet since Cocteau precisely because he is willing to make the conception of a cohesive plot (narrative) impossible. This is definitely a masterpiece for me, even amongst the other works of Lynch. In a away I'm not surprised about the negative responses. But I'm just as surprised that the audience that was glad to be horrified and removed from the mundane by virtue of shifting realities in Eraserhead, the film upon which Lynch was able to build a career, cannot accept an equally ambitious (and ambiguous) anddaring film. One thing that's missing: where are the people that are really excited about this film? I'm sure there are some, but I haven't met any. Some fans haven't even bothered to watch it.
B000002OR4|5.0|I bought this for a friend as a Christmas gift.  He was very pleased with the DVD as well as the quality of the DVD.  A must see movie for all.
B00319ECHE|5.0|I know a lot of bands say that their new album is the best album they've done since.........their one album that everyone says is their best.<br />I won't name bands, you know who I'm talking about.<br />But are their new albums a match for their masterpieces?<br />Hardly.<br />With Fear Factory it's always been about Demanufacture.<br />Some will argue that Obsolete is their best.<br />My favorite was always Demanufacture.<br />So upon hearing and reading about all the turmoil in the band I was rather happy with Archetype. It was still a great album.<br />Transgression on the other hand...............I blame the label for forcing the product before it was ready.<br />And then.............more band turmoil and we're now left with Burton and Dino again with Stroud and Hoglan.<br />And how does it measure up?<br />Does it actually match the almighty and eternal Demanufacture?<br />I didn't have my hopes set that high. I loved Divine Heresy's last album Bringer of Plagues and was hoping Mechanize would be at least half that good.<br />Man was I wrong.<br />Not only does this album equal Demanufacture I'd say its a few notches above it.<br />This album has done to me what NO album has done since I was a teenager.<br />I could literally feel the hair on the back of my neck stand up and by the time I got to Christploitation I was ready to break every window in my house.<br />This album literally made me want to go bezerk.<br />I'm 35 and it's hard to get an old geezer metal head to feel like this.<br />My favorite track is Christploitation but really, every song on this disc simply DESTROYS.<br />Everything that was great about Demanufacture is back and bigger and better.<br />It's heavy, it's fast, it's got the creepy keys and the creepy moaning vocals of Burton here and there.<br />This is simply the best disc Fear Factory has ever done and it BETTER NOT BE THEIR LAST!!!<br />Welcome back Dino, you really are the one who MADE this band what it was.<br />Gene and Byron bring a whole new intensity to FF that I've never heard before.<br />And lastly to all these bands that say that they can never do another album like the \\"old days\\".<br />I used to agree with them till I heard Mechanize.<br />If Fear Factory, after twenty years and constant in fighting can put out the album of their lives then what's YOUR excuse???<br />Mechanize is THE album on 2010. If FF doesn't get a grammy nod for this, then there IS no justice.<br />A masterpiece from start to finish.<br />Raw, brutal, unique and utterly devastating.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!at say that they can never do another album like the \\"old days\\".  I used to agree with them till I heard Mechanize.  If Fear Factory, after twenty years and constant in fighting can put out the album of their lives then what's YOUR excuse???

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I've always been a fan of the original Star Trek. Not the kind of fan who dresses up as the characters and goes to conventions, but a fan none the less.<br /><br />I always kind of wondered about the backgrounds of the original characters, like how Kirk became the Captain of the Enterprise and stuff like that. And like how Bones is the only one who ever called Captain Kirk \\"Jim\\", like they were friends. I mean, if you think about it, the TV serious started out with them just floating in space already. This movie did a great job filling in those gaps for me.<br /><br />The plot and storyline of the movie was very well written, it was well directed and the acting was very believable. And that time travel continuum concept was kind of cool too, along with excellent CG (Computer Graphics).<br /><br />This movie held my complete attention all the way through, from beginning to end. It is honestly the best movie I have ever seen so far.
B000ZELISO|5.0|Bought this for my fiance because he has a BlueRay player and it was easy to find and confirm the product since I am not familiar with the different products. Funny thing is, it was a gift for him and when it came in the mail he opened it thinking it was something that HE ordered for himself. So he got his gift early but was happy to see it
B002ODEJYE|5.0|I have to say that I've heard alot of Pink's songs over the years, and was never really a fan, but after watching this concert I have changed my mind. First, it has to be one of the best concerts I've ever seen, and she is one talented lady. I knew almost every song performed, and her renditions of cover tunes were great, as well. If you want to witness an abundance of great music combined with a fabulous show that's similar to a \\"Circ De Soleil\\", then this is the disk for you.

0764207407|5.0|I have just spent a delightful week with Jane and the editors of Bethany House. It is called the Insight Edition. It was with great anticipation that I opened the pages of this book for I had never read it before. I had only watched the movies which lent me great enjoyment. I knew, having read other Austin classics that the novel would be much better than the movies, and Jane (and her story) proved to be a most amiable companion.<br /><br />What sets this edition apart from any other, except Pride and Prejudice, is the wealth of added information from a Regency historical aspect, tidbits of opinion which evidenced delightful humor, and movie trivia. I even learned there was a S&S under the sea movie which I had heretofore never heard.<br /><br />Astoundingly, I was somewhat surprised at myself because I truly enjoyed someone else's pain and agony for a change of pace. For fully 30 chapters, Marianne was just as full of passion and sensibility at Willoughby's disgraceful treatment of her as any movie depicted. Elinor was just as full of suppressed passion and sense as the movies depicted her, and of course Mrs. Dashwood was so much more sensible than Mrs. Benton of P&P fame, which made for quite satisfying reading without the frustration of stupidity.<br /><br />If you do not have a copy of Sense and Sensibility for your library, I suggest you pick up this copy. It is well worth the money and is quite a satisfying read.
B001PJRAUS|3.0|I thought I would love this movie, but instead found it long and disappointing.  While the premise is really a great idea, some of the twists don't sit well with me.      I cannot stand the thought of poor Jane marrying that idiot Mr. Collins, and then Charlotte left for Africa and it turns out Wickham is noble??? It was all to much for me take. I held out hope that all would be righted in the end, but alas, no luck.    The best scene in the movie is when she asks Mr. Darcy to walk out of the water for her.  I laughed out loud at that, and then immediately, the next Sunday, watched my version of Pride and Prejudice with the fabulous Colin Firth.      Not for me, but I can see why some would enjoy.
6304806418|4.0|It was an enjoyable movie and it told a good story.  The music was what made the movie.  I think Madonna did an excellent job as well as Antonio Banderas.  I would like to see other movies by Andrew Lloyd Webber if possible.  I already have Phantom of the Opera.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|This was a very good cd.  I gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons: One because some of the songs had to grow on me and two because there are only 10 tracks! However, it's a really good cd. It's the same Sade and you won't be disappointed at all.  Most of the songs on the album are pretty slow and mellow. My favorite song is \\"In another Time.\\" It's such a reflection of where I'm at right now and it seems like her cds' are released at the right time for others and me.
080701429X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was an interesting look at suffering and the human condition as it applies to the most extreme of situations to the everyday.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I watch my videos from the first season to the last, usually a half an episode per day, and when I get to the end, I usually wait a few weeks and start again, though I admit I have begun to be able to recite some of the lines verbatim. I was recording them on television and watching them, but they got to the end too fast, and I did not like being tied to that much recorded television every day. This is ideal.   NO, I am not obsessed. I watch some Charmed each night as part of my unwinding before going to bed. Something very familiar is soothing and routine is helpful in getting to sleep. I teach high school, and though most are really good people, some of my students would not know a positive thought or action if it came up and kissed them on the cheek. These young charmed ladies always end up vanquishing evil in short order, setting me up for a peaceful thought before going to lala land. All the Charmed series videos are fun, and the series lets you see these fictional girls blossom into something strong and good.  I recommend the series.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is one of the greatest American novels of the 20th century.  The language is literate, but the style is modern - it's chaotic, which reflects the circumstances of war and the emotional trauma inflicted on Yossarian, the main character. From the first page where Yossarian is in the infirmary avoiding duty with a vague liver complaint, the absurdity of his circumstances is apparent.  Yossarian is a bombardier in a B-25 fighter stationed on an island off Italy in World War II. His brown-nosing commander, demonstrating the dedication of his squadron, keeps increasing the number of bombing missions required before (noun), despite the availability of fresh crewmembers.  With the high fatality rate for these missions, it's not a surprise that by the end of the book, everyone Yossarian has served with has been killed except the administrators and commanders, who find they serve their country best in a non-combat role.  Yossarian's view of war is confirmed paranoia - he believes people are trying to kill him, and they are.<br /><br />Now that I've read Catch-22, I see that it was hugely influential. MASH could not have existed without it, though MASH is upbeat compared with Catch -22.  Published in 1955, before On the Road, it is avant-garde in some of the same ways, but has a different value system.  Because of the non-linear timeline and the barrage of characters, Catch-22 was a slow, but not boring, read for me.  I can't remember another book that I liked so much that took so long to read.<br /><br />Catch-22 is a landmark book that everyone should read at some time in his or her life.  The sex and violence is understated (perhaps that's how it ended up in the Young Adult section?).  The language is rich and complex, and the ideas are fresh 50+ years later.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|The Avenged Sevenfold Live DVD is the best live DVD I have ever seen! I have watched it literally every day for the last year. The audio is superb. The clarity and 5.1 channel separation really allows you to hear every single note and cymbal crash in all its glory. The audio mixing is wonderful and everything is exactly at the right level. The visual component of the DVD is also wonderful. I saw a few reviews where the camera angles seemed too change too quickly for some people. I feel that the camera work and the video editing are beyond wonderful. The fast pace of the songs almost requires the camera angles to change quickly. If you watch closely, each angle shows something new and interesting and provides visual artwork with cool angles, in and out of focusing, and slow mo. My favorite is when they slow down a small video clip while leaving the audio at full speed to emphasize the epicness of a scream or high pitched note. The fact that the DVD is in high resolution is a huge bonus.        Enough with the technical stuff, Avenged Sevenfold is a great band live. The vocals are spot on. M Shadows does a wonderful job and even does scream like vocals. The rest of the band except for Johnny also put in great backing vocals. Most notably, The Rev (RIP) preforms wonderfully in both his backing vocals and lead vocals in Critical Acclaim and A Little Piece of Heaven (although he did forget to scream \\"Restraints are useless here\\" in the screaming section of Unholy Confessions). The guitars are flawless except for Syn stopping in the middle of the Second Heartbeat solo for no apparent reason. Drums were perfect. Overall, they had lots of energy, great enthusiasm, and put on one hell of a show (the fire helped a little too).         Also I was very surprised by the set list. I love the addition of Second Heartbeat and A Little Piece of Heaven into their regular song mix. The fact that they played A Little Piece of Heaven blew me away. It was an epic song to end with and it really was a huge surprise the first time I saw the DVD.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Do you guys remember Edward D. Wood Jr., considered to be one of the worst directors of all time? Tim Burton did a sought-after biopic film about him as well. Let's begin. It opens with a similar intro to Plan 9 From Outer Space with The Amazing Criswell (Jeffery Jones) introducing the basis of the movie. It shows Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) struggling to join the film industry. When he hears for an offer from producer George Weiss (Mike Starr) to join in the production of a gender change film, \\"I Changed My Sex!\\", Ed decides to take the offer because he likes to don women disguises with pretty much any women's garments, which is hilarious! He meets his childhood Idol Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) and they become friends and Bela joins in the movie. He wrote the script and showed to to his then-girlfriend, Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker), who loses her mind when he reviles his secret. He is also great friends with Bunny Breckinridge (Bill Murray), who decides to undergo a gender change surgery, but later changes his mind after an accident. He changed the title of the film to \\"Glen or Glenda\\"  with Bela beginning the film with his famous line \\"Pull the String!\\",and Ed was enthusiastic that he wrote, produced, directed, and starred in his own movie. Unfortunately, it failed commercially, critically and financially. He tries again to land a job at Warner Bros. and fund enough money for his next try at a movie, Bride of the Atom. That was unsuccessful, but he meets Criswell. At the bar, Ed meets Loretta King (Juliet Landau), who he thinks has enough money for his next film. Filming starts, but is put on hold. He convinced meat tycoon, Don McCoy, to fund the rest of the film, on the condition that they cast his son, Tony, and end it with a big explosion. He even meets the local Vampira Show host Vampira (Lisa Marie). As a result of Ed's transvestism and circle of friends, He and Dolores break up after the wrap party. Bela reveals to Ed that he has depression and a morphineaddiction, and tries a double suicide, but Ed convinces him to get help in rehab instead. Ed eventually meets and dates Kathy O'Hara (Patricia Arquette), who doesn't mind his nature. Ed begins shooting of another film with Bela outside of his home. The group meets up at the Bride of the Monster premier, with an angry mob chasing them away and looting the car. An angry kid even gets Vampira in the chest! Sometime later, Bela dies leaving Ed without a star. Ed convinces Reynolds that his script for \\"Grave Robbers from Outer Space\\" will result in a box office success. He finds a stunt double for the late Bela Lugosi in Kathy's chiropractor Dr. Tom Mason (Ned Bellamy). However, Ed and the Baptists have a problem with the title and decide to change it to Plan 9 from Outer Space along with his cheap movie-making skills. The pressure from the crew caused the distressed Ed to leave the set for the nearest bar where he meets another icon Orson Wells (Vincent D'Onofrio), the director of Citizen Kane, which I am planning to see later on. Wells encourages Ed to follow his dreams, finish the movie in his vision, and take action against the producers. The film ends with the premier for Plan 9, and Ed and Kathy getting married in Las Vegas, with an epilogue showing the outcome of all the main characters. This great, underrated, and sought-after movie shows a certain charm to Ed Wood's career. He made his movies super-fast and super-cheap. He didn't care about the casting and visual effects much. He mainly focuses on the plot despite the stories being dumb. It is another outstanding film by Tim Burton that rivals Edward Scizzorhands among others. It is really funny and features a message to pursue your dreams and that in terms of movie-making, the story matters the most. Most of the actors played the parts flawlessly, but the film's portrayal of Dolores Fuller was different from the real-life version, however. The black-and-white style enhances the mood like one of those early movies from the 40's and 50's and it worked out surprisingly well. If you find this movie, buy it. It is worth it to learn about one of the underdogs of film history.    P.S. When the Golden Turkey Awards gave Ed Wood the honor for worst director of all time, after seeing this film, I would rather give that honor to Uwe Boll! He makes Ed Wood look like James Cameron! Trust me!
0312427565|5.0|Wolfe really keeps you on the edge of your seat, and despite being accused of taking liberties with the literal truth still creates a book that will teach you a great deal about the history of the early days of the American space program.  This is one of the only nonfiction books I've read that reads like a well written novel.  I will be diving further into the Wolfe cannon because this book was so good.
B002Q02FS2|5.0|This is a great album for those who like the indie/alternative type genere. Its very different from most new artists, lots of talent in this girl, I love her and her music, I'm glad I found her! This version of the album in particular is a great buy withe the DVD documentary and the extra bonus tracks makes the couple of extra bucks worth while.!

B001FB4W02|5.0|Works perfectly! New to blu-ray it's good for what you get. Anyway, not new to smallville. Probably the last smallville set I will buy. They should have ended it on Season 8. The character of Lana Lang is no more, and the chemistry between the characters Lois and Clark can't compare.    Aloha
B0026P3G12|4.0|Susan has a great voice and a very good delivery.  She deserved her winnings on TV, but this recording is just OK, not great.  Perhaps she will mature with experience, I hope so.  Listening to this would not inspire me to purchase future recordings by her.
6305609748|5.0|My wife hates Sci-fi and does not like Star Trek.  However she did watch this movie with me and did really enjoy it because most of the Sci-fi was at the beginning and end of the movie.  A very good flick that has some great humorious spots.
B002BW7A58|4.0|When I first heard this album, I had a feeling it wouldnt get a good reception. Im sure most people wouldnt like this album because they just listen to rap! You really have to have an open mind and a likeness for rock to really understand and like this album. Yeah, some of the songs are really annoying. But its his first attempt at a \\"rock\\" album and I for one think it was a pretty good effort. If he makes another and I hope he does, Im sure it will be alot better. Its kinda like Andre 3000 trying to branch out to make pop music. It didnt go over well at first, but it caught on.   I applaud Wayne for trying to branch out and gain a new crowd of fans for his music.
B002RKXO6S|4.0|I wanted to wait to review this album into I had listened to all there previous albums again.Bon Jovi has evolved a lot since there 80's hair metal roots.They have released 5 studio albums of new material since 2001.None of these albums sound alike.   The Circle is there hardest rocking album since Bounce in 2002 and there best straight out rocker since 1992's Keep The Faith.I have added Born To Follow and Fast Cars to my Bad Day Playlist on my MP3 Player.These two songs are my favorite songs on the album and really help to put me in a better mood.   I recommend this album to all the Bon Jovi fans out there but for new fans get  [[ASIN:B00000I07R Keep the Faith]] and [[ASIN:B00006IX6E Bounce]] to see why this album is titled The Circle.This is mostly a postive upbeat album that is meant to be cranked to 11.

0061922315|5.0|Five solid gold stars for SECRET DAUGHTER (shakti)<br /><br />In their Indian village culture, boys are cherished, while girls are nothing more than an enormous and impossible pull on the family's financial future, and Kavita and her husband, Jasu cannot afford a girl. She has already lost one daughter in the most brutal way, and Kavita feels that she somehow has to save this daughter, this beautiful baby girl that she names Usha, even if it means she has to give her away when she is just a few days old.<br /><br />At the same time, in the United States, Krishnan and Somer Thakkar, both American doctors, decide to adopt a baby girl from a Mumbai orphanage, not far from where Krishnan grew up, not far from where his extended family still resides.<br /><br />Shilpi Somaya Gowda skillfully discloses what happens in the next twenty years after Usha is adopted, in this novel, SECRET DAUGHTER.  It is a tale about family bonds and mother-daughter relationships. It displays how just the slightest shift in perspective can reveal so much. It stresses the importance of tradition, and in the same breath, the significance of breaking old customs.<br /><br />This book was a treasure. The characters were all expertly drawn with remarkable prose, and I loved traveling via my reading experience to the two worlds inside India. While I continually devoured chapter after chapter, I hated closing in on the last page.<br /><br />If I had to mention one thing that I did not like about this debut novel, it would be the title. This book deserves a much bigger-stronger name. I would have named the book, simply...SHAKTI, which I have learned means, the sacred feminine force.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|I've listened to it and it's very good.  \\"Solder Of Love\\" was an excellent choice for the lead single.  It's very different from the rest of the songs.  The rest of the album is Sade's classic sound.  I also like \\"Be That Easy\\" and \\"In Another Time\\".  A great return for a favorite artist.  Highly Recommended!

B0013FDM7E|3.0|My comments no doubt echo those of other reviewers -- but I contribute in the hope that some filmmakers out there might actually get the message if they see it often enough: CGI just ISN'T scary!!!    In a nutshell -- Will Smith gives a good performance; using real people as zombies would've been a lot scarier than cartoonish CGI zombies.  Hell, even more realistic-looking CGI would not compete with flesh-and-blood flesh-eaters.    Roman Polanski -- for all his news-headline faults -- made a great observation on the commentary track for his film The Ninth Gate (1999): the best use of CGI is when you DON'T notice it.    CGI can be an effective tool -- it worked great in I Am Legend for creating a post-apocalyptic Manhattan.  When you overuse it, however, the result is like overusing any other cinematic tool: usually bad.    Richard Matheson's novel, I Am Legend, is one of my all-time favorites.  I also enjoyed the 1964 (The Last Man on Earth) and 1971 (The Omega Man) film adaptations, for all their faults.  I was so looking forward to this film version as I assumed it would be closer to that great novel.  I was disappointed: at least the '64 Vincent Price version had them as vampires -- and even the The Omega Man's hooded mutants came off scarier than the digital cartoons jumping around Will Smith's NY townhouse.

B002VH7P4O|2.0|We were so excited to give this gift to our son --a big Beatles fan and unfortunately the stem was broken during shipment making it impossible to remove the USB from the apple.  However, we have subsequently heard that the remastering of the songs is fabulous--we're probably resort to purchasing the CD's

B002RVZV9K|5.0|first off, the movie is great, especially if you're a guitar player.  however, i would like to point out that in the middle of a snow storm (approx. 3ft.), mixed media got this to me in two days.  Okay, so the movie doesn't have the best plot line. it's a guitar movie, what were you expecting?
B002BSHXJA|5.0|If you are a Beatle fan then don't think twice about picking up this box set. The CD's are packaged in mini-replicas of the original LP's and come with protective sleeves inside and out. But the real reason to own this essential collection is the music. \\"Please, Please Me,\\" \\"With the Beatles\\" and most of the singles included on the \\"Past Masters\\" set - or \\"Mono Masters\\" as they are called here were meant to be heard in mono. Producer George Martin and The Beatles spent a lot of time creating these mono mixes to meet their high standards, while the stereo mixes were usually regulated to staff engineers. At the time mono was the standard for recordings. \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"Beatles for Sale\\" sound great in both mono and stereo, but the stereo version of AHDN contains a bad harmonica edit on \\"I Should have Known better\\" and Paul's voice cracks toward the end of \\"If I Fell.\\" With \\"Help!\\" you get the mono and original 1965 mixes giving you the best of both versions. The title track sounds better in stereo while \\"Yesterday\\" is a particular standout in mono. But the real treats here are \\"Rubber Soul\\"(also with it's original 1965 stereo mix) and \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" which are far superior to the stereo mixes. The rockers on \\"Rubber Soul\\" are solid and punchy, while the ballads have a more lush feel to them. These mono mixes not only have a richer, more cohesive sound, but when it comes to Pepper the actual music is different. You hear instruments and vocals that were stripped away when the stereo mixes were produced. Lennon's vocal on \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" has a dreamier and more psychadelic tone to it and \\"She's Leaving Home\\" played at the proper speed here, has an added beauty that is absent from the slowed-down stereo version. There's not a track on Pepper, with the exception of \\"A Day in the Life\\" that sounds better in stereo. And then there's 'Revolver\\" and the \\"White Album.\\" Both the stereo and mono mixes of these recordings have their good points and you'll be surprised at how different certain tracks on the \\"White Album\\" sound on the mono mix. You will also hear subtle differences in the mono mix of \\"Revolver,\\" and tracks like \\"Taxman\\" and \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" that suffer from left/right channel issues in stereo have a fuller sound. I'm lucky enough to own both the mono and the stereo boxes which is the best way to go, but if you can only afford one then treat yourself to the \\"The Beatles in Mono\\" box and pick up some of the individual stereo CD's. I've been listening to these mono mixes for 4 months now and I'm still amazed by them.

B002T9H2L0|5.0|INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS<br /><br />STARRING: Brad Pitt, Melanie Laurent, Christoph Waltz, Diane Kruger, Eli Roth, Daniel Bruhl, Jacky Ido, Til Schweiger, Gedeon Burkhard, Mike Myers (yes as in Austin Powers; no joke) and the voices of: Samuel L. Jackson and Harvey Keitel<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Quentin Tarantino<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Quentin Tarantino<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Action / Drama<br />Release Date: 21 August 2009<br /><br />Despite having the word `inglourious' (yes, I am aware it is miss-spelled; so is basterds) in its title; Quentin Tarantino's latest `artsy' bloodbath Inglourious Basterds, is anything but inglorious. Behind only Public Enemies, this would be my second pick for the best movie of 2009.<br /><br />I'm such a huge fan of Tarantino's work, that I even give much praise to the continuously bashed and ridiculed Jackie Brown. Being rumored to have the nerve to walk up and personally hand-deliver a copy of his first script Reservoir Dogs, to actor Harvey Keitel; Tarantino is truly one of a kind.<br /><br />Any book on screenwriting will tell you that dialogue is supposed to be lean and that more is less. Thank God for his audience, Quentin Tarantino pays no matter to this ridiculous rule of Hollywood's thumb. The man has orchestrated some of the longest, intense, comedic and character driven tangents of dialogue, the face of cinema has ever seen. There is no shortage of them in Inglourious Basterds.<br /><br />The film begins with one in fact, and it was one of my favorite moments. We meet a French man who lives on a farm with his daughters during World War II. He is visited by the notorious Nazi, Colonel Hanz Landa, played by Christoph Waltz. The two sit and have a chat over a smoke from a pipe and a glass of refreshing milk. Their conversation? The details as to whether or not the man is hiding Jews under the floorboards of his small cottage. I won't reveal as to whether or not he is, but let's just say that what happens next sets up the entire second and third acts.<br /><br />Not long after, we meet the `Basterds.' They are a group of Jewish and American soldiers \\"dropped into France, dressed as civilians.\\" Their mission - \\"One thing, and one thing only... killin' Nazis.\\"<br /><br />Their leader is Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and he's one tough cookie. He has a heinous scar across his throat; the origin of which is never revealed to us. He seeks no greater pleasure in life, than hunting down and brutally killing and then scalping Nazis.<br /><br />Don't get too excited by this though; the only real complaint for the film I have, is there was not enough time with the `Basterds' being `Basterds.' Others would agree with me, in that we would have liked to see a few more scenes of them being `inglourious', to the Nazis. Luckily, Tarantino is already working on a prequel.<br /><br />I won't even go into any further details of the plot, as it would be virtually impossible to do without revealing crucial spoilers. I will say that is wildly entertaining and out there; as is to be expected from the mind of Tarantino.<br /><br />It will no doubt trump the Academy Awards; taking home Oscars for best picture, best director, cinematography and best original screenplay. I'd be willing to bet a small fortune that the amazing performance of Christoph Waltz as the disturbed Colonel Hanz, has already justified the engraving of his name on the Oscar for best supporting actor. He was electrifying and flawless in every scene. Tarantino had been working on this script since the early 90s, and is rumored to have put it on the back burner because he couldn't find the right `Hanz.' I think it's safe to say, he made the right choice.<br /><br />I was not at all surprised to find Brad Pitt blowing me away, yet again. The guy has perfected his craft to a serene art-form and you root for him the entire time. His accent and the persona he has given this character were hilarious.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the appearanceof Mike Myers in the film, I do have something to say about it. I'm not quite sure if it's a comment to him or not, but I mean no disrespect when I say: I can't take him seriously. He is just too funny. Much like Will Ferrell, regardless of how dramatic he is attempting to be - I am laughing.<br /><br />I'd further like to point out that Tarantino is well aware that this film is a work of fiction. Yes; there is no recording in history of the things that are partaken upon in this film. It's a movie. But we have seen countless `based on...', war films in the past. This is a new idea. A `what if' idea; and I can't think of anything more interesting then Tarantino's vision: what if LT Raine and the Basterds had whipped out Hitler and the Nazis?or not, but I mean no disrespect when I say: I can't take him seriously. He is just too funny. Much like Will Ferrell, regardless of how dramatic he is attempting to be - I am laughing.     I'd further like to point out that Tarantino is well aware that this film is a work of fiction. Yes; there is no recording in history of the things that are partaken upon in this film. It's a movie.

B001DEXDNI|5.0|This album is like a pice of fine china, showing off Annie Lennox's smoothe, smokey voice. I enjoy every track, but the ones I like best are Walking on Broken Glass, No More I Love Yous, A whiter Shade of Pale, A Thousand Beautiful Things, Love Song for a Vampire, and Shining Light.    I first heard it by checking it out of our public library. Once I listened to it, I knew I wanted a copy of my own.
B00005MP58|4.0|This is the most in-depth and well-done version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  I've watched it repeatedly, since it was originally released, and continue to be intrigued by the acting and the story nuances.  There were some weird stickers on the DVD case which disappointed me and that I didn't expect because they weren't in the picture of the DVD.  These were the sellers, I think.  They should have been removed or the disc should've been discounted, since the cover is defaced.
0385504225|4.0|I Love Dan Brown, But I just could not get into The Lost symbol.

0156907399|5.0|In what is perhaps one of the most well-known novels of the 20th century, Virginia paints the portrait of the Ramsey family living in their summer home on an island off the coast of Scotland at three pivotal moments. It's a simple story, but painfully beautiful in the telling.<br /><br />Written entirely in stream of conciousness, Woolf takes it one-step further than most and jumps from the thoughts of one person to the next with little to no warning. This can make it difficult to follow for many, but I only lost myself once and quickly figured it out. This is a storytelling device that has always greatly appealled to me and Woolf did not disappoint. The prose itself was more poetry than anything and many of the passages the words are strung together so beautifully that I can only describe it as hearbreaking. I am not a rereader of novels, but I could easily see myself reading this book once a year.
B00280LYHS|5.0|When I bought this book, I was like, Oh My God I have to read this! Obviously because this was the last book. And I wasn't dissapointed. Although I wished the books in the series were a little longer. Before I knew it, I was finished with the whole series! *sigh* MORE...                                 Anyways I know it's hopeless but still...             So just go and buy this book along with the other books!  Just an amazing book! (Too good for words.)
B0002YCVXI|5.0|I can't get enough of Yo Yo Ma.  I am not offically addicted to his music, and he has alot of it out there.  What beautiful music this is...I can't say that I recognize the scores but I love the music.  The music is whimsical, soft, and flows so nicely from one piece to another.  I will be going back to the downloads for more.  I would highly recommend this cd for the classical or anyone looking for something more contemporary.
B0030Y11XS|3.0|Excellent message about the perils of capitalism, and the victims of excessive, out of control profit seeking. I just love how the conservatives are all against the government until it comes to bailing themselves out.    But why does Michael Moore's ego compel him to make himself the centerpiece of every movie. The whole project loses credibility...and he turns into a joke...which really hurts the message of the movie.    He has turned into a Ralph Nader type character--the right message, but an \\"ego-gone-wild\\" messenger which hurts what the director is hoping to accomplish.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Unbelievable. J.J. Abrams is a genius. This movie recreated and reestablished the Star Trek genre to hosts of \\"Trekkies\\", star lost fans, and new fans alike; because he created a addendum, with room to grow, to the Star Trek legacy without taking anything away from what was previously done. Well done. I will be pulling this off my shelf many times over the next few years. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldano, Bruce Greenwood, Leonard Nimoy... etc.,etc. a most excellent work.

B0018CMJSU|5.0|Since I already love these movies I am pretty biased, however, the Coppola Restoration does have a few surprises. The supplemental materials contain some Godfather Trivia even I didn't know. The original film has been restored beautifully, though Godfather II is still a bit dark (at least on my TV). Any true fan will NEED this set for their collection. For the price it was an offer I couldn't refuse. (I couldn't help myself!)
B002GY9F9K|4.0|I enjoyed it, it has similarities to all the other movies with magic in them. So if you like these adventure/magic TV series that look like they're back in the year 1500-1800, you more than likely enjoy this one. There was a evil guy in the movie who dies in the end, which for a while I thought they'd keep him alive into season 2. Now that they fulfilled the prophecy, it'll be interesting to see what they do for season 2.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|I am really enjoying this book. I won't comment on it from a literary sense. Everyone has already exhausted that area. However, I will say that the kindle version is great except that the text does not always translate in the proper fonts. Every so often the author has emphazied a word and it shows in the Kindle as all upper case. I supposed it was supposed to be italics. A similar situation occurred in the Complete Sherlock Holmes. Certain symbols are not translated properly. The intent was still obvious. I was very reluctant to buy a Kindle at first, but I have used up all the available space in my home for paper books. The Kindle is a joy to read though and it goes very fast.
0786868724|5.0|I've read almost all of Mitch Albom's books and he is an incredibly talented writer. Each of his books contain so many priceless nuggets of wisdom and truth which we can apply to our lives.<br /><br />I love reading for many reasons: to escape, relax, ponder, feel creative, be inspired...the list could go on and on. While reading Have a Little Faith, I felt inspired and was moved to ponder so many different things about life and what is most important.<br /><br />I thought it was neat how Albom talked about his own upbringing in the Jewish religion, the dedication he had as a youth that diminished in adulthood. It was wonderful to see him embracing his faith again, recognizing how important faith is--how vital to our lives. It was also very interesting to read about his interaction with both the Christian and Jewish faiths and I loved learning about the things that pull all of us together.<br /><br />Author of [[ASIN:1599553643 Wrong Number]]
B00280LYIC|2.0|This is strange. I have the oddest feeling that I've read this somewhere before.  ...So let's tell this story, shall we? A misfit preteen, who lives with a horrible relative, discovers that he actually belongs to a separate race of people who have lived their lives for hundreds of years without being discovered by \\"normal people\\". Oh, and he has magical powers. Oh, and he is something of a celebrity. He gets his own prophecy and everything! He is the Chosen One to beat the Big Bad of Consuming Darkness (more on that later).  And so, this special boy is sent to live with other children like him in a special place where they can learn to master their powers. They are divided into different houses depending on their personalities (well, technically, their parentage. But one's parentage seems to determine one's personality, in this story), and one of these houses is full of nothing but big, nasty meanies--hence, our hero gets his very own nasty rival. These children all spend their time competing against each other in a highly-anticipated certain magical game. The place is run by a kindly, wise old man who doubtless has a beard. And our hero is enjoying himself, being accepted for Who He Is, until...  Oh no. He must go find a magical item. If it gets in the hands of the Big Bad, it would be disastrous! And so he, along with a booksmart girl and a goofy, awkward friend, go off together to find this magical item of Unquestionable Power. Through the ensuing shenanigans, he and his buds discover the power of friendship, a trusted authority-figure betrays them, and our hero returns to his mundane world just in time for an assisted murder. The end.  Now, if it sounds like I just summarized Harry Potter (more or less), then that is because I did. This is not an awful book, nor is it horribly written (I'm looking at you, Stephenie Meyer). But it is a shameless rip-off and, on top of it, is filled with nauseating attempts at snarky, \\"hip\\", kid humor. I am a kid myself, but whenthe \\"mystic Oracle\\" turned out to be a mummy...in a tie-dyed dress instead of rags, I had to cringe. In the midst of battle, our hero yells cliched one-liners like, \\"That's what I'm talkin' about!\\" and several of the attempts to cool-ify Greek mythology are simply ridiculous (Auntie M's statuary? Gee, in a story full of Greek monsters, who could possibly live here? And why did we come here, anyway? Oh yeah; it makes for a cool scene.) There was one thing I liked, though, and that was the Las Vegas take on the Lotus Eaters. That was good. I'll give you that, Rick.  But please, children, if you need something to satisfy your Harry Potter withdrawal, go look at Artemis Fowl or Inkheart, both of which are fantastic books.  There's really nothing new here.

B00000GAIW|3.0|Aqualung - Jethro Tull (3.21 stars)<br />Original Release: 3/19/1971<br /><br />Songs:<br /><br />Aqualung (4 stars)<br />Anthemic guitar line accompanies a lyrical description of a filthy pedophile-beggar who dies in the cold.  But the majority of the song's midsection features an acoustic guitar which softens the tone towards a character that the lyrics now invoke sympathy for.  Also there is an upbeat section with piano and acoustic guitar that then turns into a reflective, soulful guitar solo that in turn becomes a rock solo after the first four measures.  Great character sketch of one who has fallen to the absolute bottom.<br /><br />Cross-Eyed Mary (3 stars)<br />Lyrics seem to describe a Lolita-prostitute that has relative success over her poor piers.  Flute and mellotron start the song quiet and like the coming of some monster theme the intro builds.  Organ and guitar put a hard rock edge on the lyrical description of the song's protagonist.  This song is a good compliment to Aqualung (there is even a lyrical tie-in).  There is only a brief flute and guitar solo, but overall this is a good, funky hard rock song<br /><br />Cheap Day Return (3 stars)<br />Acoustic guitar passes briefly through a few melodies creating a sense of anticipation.  The song is short and the lyrics capture a moment, a day, that the vocalist looks back with derision to.<br /><br />Mother Goose (4 stars)<br />Lyrical encounter with various circus-fantasy figures strolling through the city.  Acoustic guitar and flute play a happy melody which draws out a sense of insanity from the lyrical events.  This song stands out for me mainly in its lighter series of engaging melodies.<br /><br />Wond'ring Aloud (3 stars)<br />Vocalist seems to be recalling images of his wife/lover who makes food and love for/to him.  Also there is a sense of drawing from these experiences deeper principles of life.  Acoustic guitar then piano then strings instrumentally decorate this short ballad.<br /><br />Up to Me (3 stars)<br />Lyrically this song looks at the world as an extension of one's self and avoiding giving up personal responsibility.  Flute and vocal laughter promise antics while the acoustic guitar plays the anthemic line.  The trickster-like sense of this song is appropriate to the theme of self-awareness.<br /><br />My God (3 stars)<br />The lyrics speak of what the church has done to God, commoditized Him amongst other things.  Acoustic guitar starts off warily.  This song has variety of melody and an instrumental section that fills out the song's length with progressive qualities.  With the guitar we finally get a good aggressive flute solo (which has been lacking somewhat from previous albums).<br /><br />Hymn 43 (3 stars)<br />The lyricists pleads to Jesus, but is sorry for how He has been abused.  This song is a piano rocker right off the bat with a guitar anthem.  There is definitely something of the holy roller passion in the vocals as well.<br /><br />Slipstream (3 stars)<br />Short song that seems to be a warning to the materialists in the pews.  Sweet vocals, strings and acoustic guitar counter the sarcasm of the lyrics.  The strings end in a vaguely chaotic dissipation created by some studio effects.<br /><br />Locomotive Breath (3 stars)<br />Return to a character sketch of desperation; this time about a man for whom everything is going wrong/spinning out of his control.  A peaceful piano intro. with Chopin-esque qualities gives way to a soulful guitar and piano movement, then a 4/4 rock rhythm, still calm but sassy.  Further instrumentalism includes a guitar and piano anthem.  A throbbing bass pushes this rock 'n' roll train along.<br /><br />Wind Up (3 stars)<br />Bitter resentment directed at the church in the form of a flat denial of their grasp on the truth.  A quiet guitar and vocals accompanies this lyrical message.  This melody repeats and builds instrumentally and in volume until the final guitar anthem kicks in.  The ballad then turns into hard rock.  This process repeats from quiet to loud to quiet, perhaps, suggesting a winding up and down movement.<br /><br />Album:<br />This fourth Jethro Tull album is yet another collection of songs but with a more coherent sound across the whole album.  The character sketches and the God-church songs represent a couple of themes on this debatable two-concept album.  Certainly the guitar has found a clearer more confident voice.  There is also a flirtation with the progressive rock form in a couple of the longer songs.  Jethro Tull continues to rotate through different sounds turning by degrees from blues to hard rock.  Some of the songs I recognize from the radio I may have already heard too many times and so their character may not impress me as much as it should (particularly \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\" and \\"Locomotive Breath\\").<br /><br />A couple of songs on this album strike me as progressive rock songs: Aqualung and My God.  Other songs indicate their penchant for complex composition but they have not yet broken through into this, at the time, still emerging genre.  Overall I not yet as engaged with Jethro Tull's sound on this album (rather I prefer particular songs) as I am on many of their later albums.<br /><br />MP3 recommendation:<br /><br />Four star songs (4 stars)<br />1.

386521584X|5.0|Robert Frank's book \\"The Americans\\" presents a stunningly visual portrayal of the 1950's culture and the times we lived in.  Frank's photographs brought back strong memories of people and places I remember.  I saw his anniversary exhibit in New York and felt the book really captured his photographs.  These are strong pictures, ones you'll remember.  I recommend this book to all--not just photography lovers, but to anyone who wants to see a slice of American life gone by.
B00260HH3K|1.0|As a hardcore fan of the DragonBall series, I felt it was my duty to review and report the epic failures that made up the live-action DragonBall movie, DragonBall Evolution. I would write SPOILER ALERT, but let's be honest, the movie's pretty much spoiled as it is.     Here is the good:    1. Master Roshi is wearing a Hawaiian shirt.   2. Master Roshi is still a pervert.   3. The Dragonballs look pretty amazing.   4. Chi-chi is pretty HOT.     That's about all. Here are 35 inconsistencies, failures, and generally speaking, crap found in the movie. Some of these are painstakingly obvious flaws, yet they must be mentioned:    1. Goku has no tail.   2. Goku goes to high school.  3. Goku hits puberty.   4. Chi-chi isn't the innocent little girl as we know in the series; in fact, she's a bit of a tramp.  5. \\"Air bending\\" is a misnomer used to describe ki energy waves.   6. Kamehameha waves can heal people.   7. Piccolo has Darth Vader powers.   8. Piccolo wears some sort of body armor.   9. Master Roshi is not old, nor bald.   10. World Martial Arts tournaments take place in a sumo wrestling arena.   11. Capsules operate with remotes...and no, there is no magical cloud with \\"POOF!\\" written out that appears.   12. There are no furry, talking animals.   13. Additionally, the setting is modern day Earth, unlike the anime which takes place in an alternate reality that is an amalgam of prehistoric times and the future.   14. The Eternal Dragon is a wispy, cloud. He can neither talk nor pass sarcastic comments.   15. The mention of \\"Namek\\" is an anachronism.   16. Piccolo somehow knows that Goku can tranform into Oozaru.   17. Solar eclipses make Goku go Ape-form.   18. The special effects are pathetic for Michael Bay's standards. In fact, the final fight evoked painfully supressed memories of Power Ranger action sequences.   19. Goku doesn't need incentives to blast awesome Kamehameha waves. In fact, he isn't supposed need anyone to teach it to him.  20. Chi-chi clone?!?! What the hell?  21. Grandpa Gohan is killed when a house collapses on him. This is retarded for three reasons. Gohan's supposed to be dead in DB. Gohan is killed by Oozaru form Goku. Gohan is one of the strongest in DB, but no, he dies because a house collapses on him.   22. There is an over-emphasis on the use of guns.   23. Bulma does not have blue hair, instead she has wispy blue highlights   24. Kame House is still located on an island. But the island is in New York City. Don't ask.   25. Capsule Corp vehicles are transformer robots.   26. The Power Pole is seen with Goku, yet he never uses it.   27. There is no Nimbus Cloud, which is the classic icon of DragonBall next to the Power Pole.   28. Apparently Goku has super-elastic clothes.   29. The clothing is too modern, especially for Goku who only wears training clothes in the anime.   30. Bulma's objective is to use the Dragonballs to harness energy. In the series, her wish was for a boyfriend.   31. Goku is insecure and a bit of a weiner.  32. The action was very un-Dragonball-esque.   33. Yamcha, the most poorly developed character, lacked signatures such as Puar, Wolf-Fang Fist, and a sword.   34. There is no awesome egg hatching. Piccolo creates minions from sci-fi DNA extraction and cloning.   35. Possibility of a sequel....oh crap.

0393075966|3.0|Professor Stiglitz's account of the causes of the financial crisis is lucid, and his advice regarding the need for regulation of banks and other financial institutions is sound. Stiglitz is an unapologetic man of the left, but his book is more balanced than many which have addressed this issue from the right. (E.g., Thomas Sowell's \\"The Housing Boom and Bust\\".)    Moreover, he grounds his book in a clear exposition of why advocacy for unfettered free markets does not duly consider imperfect competition (monopolies), externalities, irrationality, and asymmetric information, the subject for which he earned the 2001 Nobel Prize for economics.    So why do I give this book only three stars?    When I was an economics student in the 1960's, we learned our Keynes, and then we learned our Keynes, and then we learned our Keynes again. Over the next forty-odd years, as my knowledge of economics became antiquated, new problems arose and new theories were advanced to grapple with them, but I didn't have the time to study them. In the months after September, 2008, I devoted myself to relearning macroeconomics, which for me meant revisiting Keynes. With that basis, I couldn't fathom the ideas of the Chicago school...Lucas, Cochrane, Barro (although he is at Harvard), and others. Still, I came to some understanding of, if not agreement with, their ideas.    Stiglitz is harshly critical of their work, pointing out that their elegant mathematical models are highly constrained by assumptions that most of us would find unrealistic, and that they reach conclusions (such as that unemployment can't exist) that are absurd.     He further asserts that his own equally elegant mathematical models show the fallacies in the Chicago school's arguments. For example, he states that while they would grant that asymmetric information exists, they claim their models are \\"close enough\\", while his work shows that even small doses of imperfect information are sufficient to distort the operation of free markets to such a degree that efficient outcomes can hardly be assured. Thus, government intervention is required to produce better results.     The problem is that Siglitz does not offer the reader proof. It is true that this is because most readers (including myself) could not follow the mathematics involved, but based on the scanty evidence he provides, one cannot help being a bit skeptical. To wit:    1. He belittles the ideas of his opponents, but what arguments would they offer in rebuttal?    2. All economic models are approximations of reality. Are his opponents' actual policy recommendations as far out as he claims, or is he merely  using their models as straw men?     3. Are we to believe that government policy makers are any more capable of producing economically efficient outcomes? As human beings, are they not also subject to the perils of externalities, irrationality, asymmetric information, and even (in the case of government enterprises) monopoly exploitation?     4. When Stiglitz broadens his recommendations beyond the nuts and bolts of banking reforms, he seems to launch into yet another vain sermon advocating the perfectibility of humankind. Is that sound economic analysis or merely an expression of his hopes and dreams?    After reading the book, I don't know the answers to such questions. It may well be that Professor Stiglitz has an irrefutable case for both his diagnosis and his cures, but he asks the reader to accept too much based solely on his claims to wisdom.
0446569895|4.0|Ozzy has been the subject of so many rumors it is wonderful to have him tell his story.  Obviously, someone who was there when all it happened might have a different take on things but they are free to write their own book, right?  In my opinion this book is good but not great.  It has a whole lot of regret in it, and while it is HIS book and as such I respect his honesty, as a reader I find the story does get bogged down a bit in focusing on all his regret.  Not that he comes off feeling sorry for himself; he does a fine job of conveying sincere regret over some of his behavior without trying to beg any sympathy.  To its credit, it is a very \\"breezy\\" read; by that I mean one just gets lost in it and looks up later surprised that 100 pages have just come and gone!  And, as others have commented, there are several straight up hilarious moments . . . I'd expect no less.  But I see it as two things - what one thinks about Ozzy and what one thinks about Ozzy's book.  I have been a fan of Ozzy since about 1972 and realize that any lead singer is part of a very complicated experience called \\"a band\\" and although my personal belief is that nothing compares to his music with Sabbath he did put out some decent music after that period ended.  Three cheers for Ozzy.  I think most anyone would enjoy sitting down and tipping a pint with him . . . even if his by necessity now is orange juice.  No problem - he's got nothing left to prove to anyone.  And hats off to Sharon.  That kind of love and loyalty any man would give his left nut for if he has one lick of sense . . . one thing is certain and that is there's never been an Ozzy before and there probably won't be one again.

B00164KYV4|3.0|After being bombarded with The Rules, Sex In The City, a stream of romantic comedies and the like, we are at last seeing these principals in action.  \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" has been yet another dating training film, and while we laugh at the mildly amusing we are supposed to see ourselves in these situations and change our behaviors.  It is a shame that we put ourselves in these situations, but not that funny that we really do delude ourselves into thinking that something will come of a man who is, simply, not that into us.    The funniest, and most pathetic, is that of GiGi, who shows up at a bar wanting to return some guy's pen in the hopes of seeing him again.  In a not so ironic twist, the bar owner, Justin Long, becomes her romantic interest even though she talks to him as if he is her therapist before he too rejects her and he inevitably realizes that he likes her as well.  Drew Barrymore is guided through her minor trials and tribulations by her army of gays, her funniest scene is when they listen to her botched voice mails from her MySpace antics.  Jennifer Aniston has been living with her boyfriend for the last seven years and he's simply \\"not into marriage\\", causing her much stress.  And Scarlette Johansen is having an affair with a married man, believing within that he will leave his wife for her while his wife, Jennifer Connelly, is at home suffering.  So here are the situations before all the hype.  It's rather painfully obvious that all are in situations where their men are just not that into them.  We as the audience know this, but they don't seem to.  It's kind of pathetic really.    It has a few moments of entertainment here, but honestly, we as the viewing audience are \\"not that into this movie\\" much of the time.  It's alright, have fun with it, but what is sad is that there are a few major life lessons here for the clueless.
031606792X|3.0|I vote this book \\"best of four.\\" It's a real page-turner, and there's a good story line. The book opens with the wedding of Bella Swan and Edward Cullen. The setting is breath-taking; the occasion made perfect by the arrival of Bella's best friend and \\"best man\\" Jacob who has been MIA. The couple leaves on honeymoon to Esme Island in the Tropics.<br />They \\"do it\\" the right way, after marriage. Bella does not die. The information is given in a non-titillating way. Your 10 year olds are good to go reading this. Against all expectations, Bella becomes pregnant. This is a life-threatening complication, but Bella has had dreams of her child, and does not want to abort.<br /><br />It seems marriage is already good for Bella; she annoyed me far less in this book than in the previous 3. You will enjoy meeting Renesmee and it seems there has to be a sequel!

B002YIHO7I|1.0|Before my wife bought this for me, knowing I was eagerly awaiting it, I told her that I hoped Sade would infuse some of her upbeat, rhythmic song styles (like in \\"Maureen,\\" for example)...something with a little life in it and a little chutzpah. However, I hoped this knowing that she seems to have trapped herself in this slow, brooding style of her last couple of CDs.     Well, to my dismay she's even slowed it up even more and the lyrics have gotten even more melodramtic and pathetic. Ugh! This is one excruciating CD.     Enough of the sad, slow, torturous unrequited love crap and let's have some fun, Sade. You're 50 for crying out loud! You should be enjoying your trials and tribulations in love, not crying in your soup like some lovelorn teen. More Barry White, please.

0451228731|5.0|wow, this book is great but at the same time very dangerous, making our daily on-line activities suddenly not so easy to take for granted. nice writing, the words and the sentences just flow like water in the aqua duct, no congestion at all, and the plot, my my my, so intense and so tricky. i am not a gamer since day one i touched a computer, but those games described in this novel are indeed only strengthen my decision not to play any game, no matter how boring my life seems to be. this is a wonderfully novel with ingenious creativity. sincerely kowtow to this author and would grab any new book coming from his way.
B002T4LP6S|1.0|You would think that a book, from Richard Dawkins, headline titled: `The Greatest Show on Earth' with the sub-title in caps: \\"THE EVIDENCE FOR EVOLUTION\\" would be set to pin your ears back with rocketing fact after fact.    In fact, it's actually a fizzer.    Yes, I bought Richard's solid hardcover version, efficiently delivered, fresh from Amazon Books, with its seductively shimmering butterflies dust cover, but that was as solid a feel as the book presented. Its contents were mushy and anything but solid facts for the \\"evidence of evolution\\".    After having read his other books, I was expecting a change in his writing style, with plenty of the Indicative Mood and Declarative Mood in the way definite facts would be presented.     But, alas no.    After reading Richard's 437 pages of the hardcover version, I was struck by the number of times the subjunctive mood, of suppositions and imaginations about the Theory of Evolution, were palmed off by him, as ostensibly being \\"fact\\".    \\"Evolution is a fact\\" he retorts 10 times over like a chanting monk. When we read on to look for the substantiation of his claim, it is like reading the fairy tale about how the \\"Emperor has new clothes\\", when in fact he is nakedly bereft of such material substance.    Of course his mentor Charles Darwin, also entertained us with the Subjunctive mood, cleverly wriggled as if it were factual truth.  Darwin was proud to be in debates, a \\"great wriggler\\".    There were around 800 such uses of \\"maybe\\", \\"perhaps\\", \\"possibly\\", \\"might\\", \\"suppose\\", \\"could\\", \\"suggests\\", \\"conceivable\\", \\"seems to suggest\\" etc, in my copy of Darwin's 429 pages of \\"The Origin of the Species\\".    However, Richard surpasses his evolutionary high priest of Materialistic Philosophy, with 1,079 uses of such examples of the subjunctive mood in \\"Greatest Show...\\"    Funnily enough ...he admits to expecting us to fall for his \\"seduction\\" (p.45, 61), to accept such an excessive level of subjunctive vague concoction to be scientific \\"fact\\"!?    Here are a few examples:  \\"It is theoretically possible to imagine - maybe that's the way things work on some alien planet - that DNA might have been a coded description of a body: a kind of three-dimensional map rendered into the linear code of DNA 'letters'. (p215)    Notice `theoretically\\", \\"possible\\", \\"imagine\\", \\"maybe\\", \\"might\\". This is not the indicative mood of genuine fact. This is the conjunctive mood of ethereal dreaminess.    \\"It is an interesting question how the transition was made in the ancestry of mammals. Maybe there was an intermediate stage, which hardly bent its spine at all, in either direction, like a frog.\\" (p298)    Notice the use of the subjunctive mood \\"maybe\\". Where is the declarative fact of information about the intermediate stage claimed by Richard? It's not there. Hardly scientific. More like imaginary science fiction. He simply speculates on there being a transitional stage but has no fossil or other scientific proof of fact. Just his vivid imagination and his admitted love of \\"storytelling\\". (p37 The Blind Watchmaker)    \\"The theory that we seek, of the origin of life on this planet, should therefore positively not be a plausible theory! If it were, life should be common in the galaxy. Maybe it is common, in which case a plausible theory is what we want. But we have no evidence that life exists outside this planet, and at very least we are entitled to be satisfied with an implausible theory. If we take the Fermi question seriously, and interpret the lack of visitations as evidence that life is exceedingly rare in the galaxy, we should move towards positively expecting that no plausible theory of the origin of life exists.\\" (p422)    Notice, Richard's conjunctive mood feeling, that \\"no plausible theory of the origin of life exists\\".     So, considering his master Darwin's book was about \\"The Origin of the Species\\" by Evolution's natural selection it is contradictory for his protégé to proclaim \\"evolution is a fact\\",when there is still \\"no plausible theory for the origin of life\\".    His self-contradictory style of writing pervades his books. The subjunctive mood is here illustrated in \\"theory, we seek, should, plausible, maybe\\", \\"should move towards\\", and \\"positively expecting'.  All conjecture.  ...\\"entitled to be satisfied\\", \\"implausible theory\\".      Why should all of us \\"be satisfied with an implausible theory\\", as Richard is?    \\"But Odontochelys throws speculation back into the melting pot. We now have three possibilities, all equally intriguing.  1 Proganochelys and Palaeochersis might be survivors of the land dwelling  animals that had earlier sent some representatives to sea... This hypothesis would suggest that the shell evolved on land...  2 The shell might have evolved in water, as the Chinese authors suggest, with the plastron over the belly evolving first, and the carapace over the back evolving later...  3 Proganochelys and Palaeochersis might represent an earlier return from the water to the land. Isn't that a startlingly exciting thought?\\" (p179)    Notice here, Richard's heavy use of the subjunctive mood in his guessing games of: \\"speculation\\", \\"possibilities\\", \\"might\\", \\"hypothesis\\", \\"would suggest\\", \\"might have\\", \\"suggest\\", \\"might represent\\"    ...and to cap it all off, with a laugh: \\"Isn't that a startlingly exciting thought?\\"    Heh heh! Yes indeed, Richard.    His excessive use of the subjunctive mood with tentative tones, only weakens his argument, and leaves his 10 protestations about how \\"evolution is a fact\\" whistling in the wind, much like Jacques lines in Act 2 of Shakespeare's, As You Like It:   \\"Turning again toward childish treble, pipes. And whistles in his sound.\\"    From the same play; like \\"a soldier, full of strange oaths\\" he boldly proclaims his book to be the \\"evidence for evolution\\", and \\"jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, seeking the bubble reputation\\" he spends a semantically gymnastic chapter trying to prove Evolution tobe his coined \\"theorum\\" (sic) rather than as it is scientifically known, as a \\"Theory\\".    No. The \\"Greatest Show...\\" purports to be the \\"Evidence for Evolution\\", but by his subjunctive mood, you get the strong impression of Richard's \\"Suggestions for Evolution\\" or \\"Plausibility of Evolution\\". Anything but definite scientific fact for the \\"evidence of Evolution\\".    However, to be fair, Richard has shown some improvement.    If you think that 1,079 uses of the subjunctive mood is an eyebrow raiser, in \\"Greatest Show...\\" claiming \\"evolution is a fact\\", that is nothing to the over 1,500 uses of the subjunctive mood in Richard's \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\", which was of course, about the very blind, purposeless, unconscious, mindless, visionless, unintelligent, invisible \\"force\\" known as \\"Natural Selection\\", which Richard believes, brought you, me, and he, into existence.    Just like Jacques in Shakespeare's \\"As You Like It\\", when you finish Richard's 'Greatest Show...\\", you will be drawn to the conclusion that it is...    ...\\"Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\\"

B001NFTZPM|3.0|This version is okay, but I wish I bought another version. In fact, I'm still contemplating purchasing another version and selling this one. I like that it came with the bonus dvd with extra special features. However, I don't like the general look of the DVD case held inside the bat mask. I feel like the case would break leaving the dvd susceptible to damage. Probably not great for long-term use.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I have been a Beatle fan for over forty years and at last I have got a remastered set that sounds better than the EP and LPs that I listened to when I was growing up. I was so disappointed in the 1987 CD releases and I only mostly played the White Album from that collection.  In contrast, now I have the Mono Set I am now listening to all the early stuff and really enjoying the great music again.      The Mono versions sound smooth and full and the standouts are Sgt Peppers, Mono Masters, Revolver, Rubber Soul and the White Album.  My advice to anyone that is a Beatles fan is to do yourself a favour and get this set.  By the way I live in Sydney Australia and buying off Amazon was hassle free.

B002XTBEDI|4.0|Cranford is always a joy to watch - the cast of older, distinguished actors is wonderful and engaging, but I found this sequal a little shallower and less developed than the original series. I'm still working my way through the series, so this might be premature, but it's harder to be engaged with the younger, new members of the cast - especially Peggy.    Also slightly disturbing is the change in the established characters appearance - it's very slight, but the whole cast seems to have gone blonde all of a sudden (but kept their brown eyebrows)... a small detail, but it's distracting from the content :-)    Sorry! Otherwise a lovely, clean and engaging series

B002XTBEDI|3.0|While I could not give this sequel the 4 or 5 stars of the original Cranford, it was still very entertaining and like visiting old neighbors that you haven't seen in several months!  Miss Matty, Miss Pole, and the others were as wonderful as before, with the cast additions being a pleasant group.  Missing were the really strong performances of Francesa Annis and Philip Glennister, as well as both 'doctors' from Cranford I.    Imelda Staunton, Jim Carter and Julia McKenzie were back as well as the 'he's grown a foot taller!' young protege/beneficiary.  Emma Fielding as still wonderful as well as Miss Galindo.    Just about the most perfect cast you could want on all counts, with costumes, art direction and music just excellent.      If you want to live a little while in 1800s rural Britain, Cranford and 'Return to Cranford' (AKA Cranford I and Cranford II) are for you.
0679745203|2.0|so I saw the movie when it came out, and really liked it.  I always meant to read the book and finally found a copy.  I made several attempts to get started and found it confusing and impenetrable.  finally, I decided to plow through to the end believing it must be good since the movie was, and the book was a best-seller.    I must say that there isn't much to the book.  nothing happens; no real plot develops.  it just ends, with a little end-note about Kip the sapper after the war which was both jarring and unnecessary.    the most unsatisfying loose-end is the fate of the patient Almasy.  the book ended with him in bed just like it started, and never having been forthcoming with Hana, Carvaggio, or Kip.    also, once in the book it says the Bedouins treated Almasy with tannic acid which turned his skin dark.  that is truly bizarre. this is how you tan animal hides to make leather.  it kills the cells and makes them non-porous.  is there a dermatologist in the house to comment?

B00280LYIC|5.0|Mr. Riordan is blessed with the gift of whimsy.  The writing makes you smile, laugh and just generally \\"feel good.\\"  I bought this Kindle edition based upon the upcoming movie release, and I am glad I did.  Good character development, good plot and good twists without straining the reader's suspension of disbelief (well, if you can get past the whole \\"Greek gods are real\\" thing, of course).  I, as a 40 year old curmudgeon, enjoyed the book and my 10 year old nephew devoured the entire series in about 6 weeks.  Not many writers can lay claim to that broad of a readership.  I also salute the writer and the publisher for putting it out on Kindle at a price point that makes it attractive to take a chance on.    As a side benefit, my kids are getting exposed to Greek mythology, which serves such an important linguistic role in their education.  Kudos to Mr. Riordan for sneaking education into something kids look forward to reading.  I'm sure this means that the movie will be a big disappointment, but at least it motivated me to read a book I would not have otherwise read.  I look forward to readint the series.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I didn't expect to like \\"Avatar\\", the new film from director James Cameron, as much as I did. From the moment I first saw the trailer, the people Cameron spent almost a decade perfecting, the tall, blue Alien race created with new advancements in filmmaking and 3-D technology, seemed fake. And it didn't help when I learned the film would run almost three hours. Three hours is a long time to sit wearing 3-D glasses over your existing glasses. But as the hype began to grown, I dutifully purchased two tickets for a screening in an AMC IMAX screen. I knew I wanted to see the film in 3-D, but after experiencing 3-D on an IMAX screen, I knew I had to take this extra step for this event.<br /><br />\\"Avatar\\" is an experience, more than a film. The story is not the most original (I have seen two comparisons of how closely the story matches two other popular films, and I have been told there are more) but the same could be said of \\"Titanic\\", Cameron's last film. What sets the filmmaker's works apart from others is the scale of the canvas he tells these stories on and the craft he uses to tell these stories. It almost seems like he wants to get the story hammered down so he can start to concentrate on the other elements involved and craft a really great film. In \\"Titanic\\", he recreates the large cruise ship's only sailing to tell the story of two young lovers traveling across the Atlantic to what they hope will be new beginnings. Of course, they don't arrive in America as planned, but the story remains an indelible and romantic film. It also launched both Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet into a new era of their careers. As you know, it became the highest grossing film of all time. Until \\"Avatar\\"...<br /><br />So, it took some time for Cameron to come up with a follow-up. As the story goes, he went to a couple of his visual effects partners to talk about this project and they stated they were at least ten years away from being able to tell the story he wanted to tell in the way he wanted to tell it. What does Cameron do? He waits. And develops technology of his own to help improve the motion capture technology he would use, the same technology Robert Zemeckis (\\"Polar Express\\", \\"Beowulf\\", \\"A Christmas Carol\\") has been using for some time. The difference is Cameron has taken this technology to a new level, giving all of the characters more life and more human reactions, movements and expressions.<br /><br />It is also, in my mind, the first film to fully embrace the 3-D technology in a way that adds to the film. In many 3-D offerings, the 3-D enhances the look and feel of the film, adding dimension and depth to buildings, walks, etc. In \\"Avatar\\", the 3-D helps make the action scenes more exciting and visceral. It reminds me of the 3-D films of the 50s. \\"House of Wax\\" opens with a busker hitting a ping-pong ball to get the attention of people walking by. A few times, he hits the ball at the camera and people in the audience were said to flinch back because they thought the ball was coming at them. In \\"Avatar\\", there are a few moments when the characters are riding on these winged beasts and the 3-D camera work seems to scream, \\"Look at me\\" but in a good way. You actually get a feeling for the flight of these creatures and it makes an exhilarating experience.<br /><br />Jake Scully (Sam Worthington, \\"Terminator Salvation\\", the upcoming \\"Clash of the Titans\\" remake) is a paraplegic former Marine who steps in and takes over an assignment meant for his twin brother. He is going to travel to Pandora, a planet holding a necessary and valuable resource for Earth. Given the Earth needs the new power supply, they have already set up a colony on Pandora, to mine the resource. But the indigenous people, the Na'vi, blue skinned creatures standing seven and eight feet tall, are fighting back, trying to save their planet. Dr. Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), sympathetic to the Na'Vi, has come up with a program in which Avatars are used by real people to enter and hopefully help the people who are indigenous to the planet. They want the Na'Vi to relocate to allow easier access to the valuable and necessary mineral the humans of Earth need. The government and the private contractor they have hired are becoming impatient and want to move things along, so they decide to use trained Maries. The assignment is attractive to Jake because it allows him an escape from his wheelchair, giving him the freedom he craves and misses, even if only while using his Na'Vi Avatar. He quickly meets Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a fierce warrior who doesn't trust Jake at first. But Jake begins to help the Na'Vi in ways his boss, Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) doesn't like.<br /><br />I have seen comparisons of this basic story to both \\"Dances with Wolves\\" and \\"Pocahontas\\" and I have heard of many more. Most films made today could fall under the same scrutiny. It is very difficult, at this point, to tell a completely original story. What is important for me is how the screenwriter, director and actors make the new project their own. In \\"Avatar\\", Cameron creates a completely new world with the same skill and expertise he has used on every one of his previous films. While watching \\"The Abyss\\", I often feel I am trapped in the underwater vessel along with Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Every time I watch \\"Aliens\\", I feel like I am at Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) side as she battles the Alien. In \\"Terminator 2\\", I feel like I am along for the ride with Ahnuld, Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong, personally invested in stopping Judgment Day. That is Cameron's gift. He gives his characters such insurmountable tasks we can't help but find them intense. Their intensity makes them more interesting and believable. We feel every moment of pain they go through as they try to meet these seemingly impossible goals.<br /><br />He is also one of the few filmmakers who seem to invest as much in his characters and story as he does in the special effects. Cameron is a very creative filmmaker and doesn't care if he pushes the boundaries of what can be done with special effects. The 'water sprite' in \\"The Abyss\\" was created with new technology and this same technology was further refined to create the T-1000 for \\"Terminator 2\\". As mentioned before, when he first came up with the idea for this film, he had to wait for the technology to develop and to create some of his own magic to aid in the process.<br /><br />To give you an idea of the kind of magic Cameron has created here, a number of top Hollywood filmmakers, including Spielberg and Peter Jackson visited the set during production, eager to check out the new technology.<br /><br />As Jake becomes more invested in the Na'Vi people, we learn more about their lives and their culture. All of the people have these long ponytails they use to connect to the animals and their planet. When they are using these large winged animals for battle and transportation, they connect their ponytails to them and they form a symbiotic relationship. Neytiri also shows Jake how to use the ponytail to connect to the planet, the fibers seem to intertwine with the roots of trees. And all of these lead to a larger parable about the environment. The Na'Vi people are trying to protect their unique and beautiful planet. The humans are trying to mine a valuable resource and don't really care if they destroy it; Earth needs this mineral to continue to survive.<br /><br />There is a scene late in the film in which we come upon a large gathering of Na'Vi, sitting cross-legged in front of the \\"Tree of Life\\". All of the people plugged in with their ponytails, swaying back and forth, chanting, the blue palette glowing with the rhythm of the music. This scene initially struck me as a little too 'hippy dippy', but somehow Cameron managed to make me quickly forget it and I became even more involved in the story.<br /><br />Ultimately, what I am trying to say is that this film is an experience that needsto be seen to give it justice. Nothing I can describe or discuss would adequately impart anything that can do the film justice.<br /><br />Perhaps even more important? The film doesn't feel like it is two hours and forty plus minutes long, it feels shorter.<br /><br />And when you see it, please see it in 3-D. IMAX 3-D is even better.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Rejoice! The troubadour par excellence of the late twentieth century has risen from the crypt in which he had untimely entombed himself, and put to flight the rumors anticipating his final demise.  In this performance, Leonard Cohen is effusively grateful to his audience, and the audience reciprocates with unrestrained enthusiasm.  During his brief opening words to the audience, he observes that he hasn't been in London in fourteen years, and that on that occasion, he was \\"Sixty years old -- just a kid with a crazy dream.\\"  The audience responds with hearty, affectionate laughter.  After the intermission, he cracks another joke about his age, and thanks the audience for \\"keeping my songs alive.\\"<br /><br />He begins most of his songs with a brief recitation of the most memorable lyrics in his soft, rasping voice.  Then he swings into the tune with familiar ease, as each member of his ensemble takes up their part with passionate discipline, warmth, and sincerity. Almost all of the songs are drawn from his familiar, well-loved repertoire, starting with \\"Dance Me To The End of Love,\\" continuing through such stalwarts as \\"Bird On A Wire,\\" \\"Tower of Song,\\" and \\"Suzanne.\\"<br /><br />If there are weak points in the concert, it is when he sings a couple of songs -- \\"Boogie Street\\" and \\"My Secret Life,\\" authored by his \\"collaborator,\\" Sharon Robinson.  Although they go down well, the lyrics are distinctly less complex.  The feel-good moment of the concert is supposed to be Leonard's performance of a new political song, \\"Democracy,\\" and while the song is heartening, its literalism contrasts awkwardly with the lyricism of Leonard's other works.  Put simply, Leonard Cohen isn't Bruce Cockburn.<br /><br />The closeout of the concert is an exquisitely long affair with one song about endings segueing into the next.  \\"Take This Waltz\\" is the nominal last song.  Then they return for \\"So Long Marianne,\\" swing into \\"First We Take Manhattan,\\" and wind down again with \\"Sisters of Mercy.\\" After this second ending, Leonard reads the lyrics to a new song, \\"If It Be Thy Will,\\" in which he alludes to the \\"obstacles\\" that brought him to the brink of despair and led him to surrender his fate, leaving it to the Almighty whether he should ever sing again. After his two backup singers render the song in a touching duet, he rolls into \\"Closing Time,\\" \\"I Tried to Leave You,\\" and \\"Whither Thou Goest.\\"  By the time Leonard says his last goodbyes, the audience has been filled to overflowing, and it feels as if the Universe has been enriched by an exchange of great affection and warmth.<br /><br />I am sure that many people, like myself, had concluded that Leonard's dismal mumblings on \\"Ten New Songs\\" spelled the end of his creative time on this Earth.  Fortunately, he was gifted with the \\"obstacles\\" to which he alluded, and the travail roused him from the tomb.  As some of us know, the obstacles included having $5 Million stolen from him by his longtime assistant Kelly Lynch, a Buddhist of the Vajra Vampyre sect. No doubt this was a terrible experience for him, but the results have been good for all of us.  Leonard has lost a modest fortune, but regained his immense creative power.  In this performance, he stands before his audience in humble gratitude for helping him to reclaim this gift.ding, Leonard reads the lyrics to a new song, \\"If It Be Thy Will,\\" in which he alludes to the \\"obstacles\\" that brought him to the brink of despair and led him to surrender his fate, leaving it to the Almighty whether he should ever sing again.

B001N26GFM|5.0|Set during the World War II holocaust, The Boy In The Striped Pajamas follows the development of the unlikliest friendship between two little boys - one, a Jewish prisoner at one of the Nazis's extermination camps; the other, the son of the commanding officer of that very camp, who in his childhood innocence knows nothing about what his father really does for a living or the real situation of the war around them (which German children were taught had Germany as the 'good guy' and the Allies as aggressors).       Shortly after the boy's father is assigned the new commanding officer of the camp and he and his family relocate there (to an expansive manor - the contrast between the comfortable, supposedly civilized lifestyle of the German officers living right next to a death camp is striking), the boy, Bruno, who spends much of his time alone, comes to a wire fence and meets up with the little boy on the other side of it.  The little boy, Shmuel, is very relucant to say anything of his situation, likely knowing that contact with any non-prisoner is forbidden and would have severe consequences.  Bruno, for his part, is puzzled by the fence and why the other boy wears 'striped pajamas' (the prison garb) all the time, but decides, using innocent eight year-old logic, that all the people on the other side of the fence must be farmers who live there and just dress strangely.  Despite their differences, the two become friends, and Shmuel begins to tell Bruno more of his circumstances.  Bruno brings food to the fence for the under-fed Shmuel, and the two play games through the fence.       As Bruno is starting to have doubts about why is his father is running such a place, the rest of the family begins to learn more of the true nature of the camp.  Some seem undisturbed and others horrified, and the question of just when did the German people start to realize what was really going on in a major plot thread.  It's appalling to see the Nazi rationale for their actions, the explanations they give that the people on the other side of the fence \\"aren't really people\\", the warped propaganda that Bruno and other children are taught during lessons by their tutors.  Eventually, the friendship between Bruno and Shmuel is discovered, although Bruno remains determined to stay loyal to his little friend, leading up to a calamitous and heart-rending end phase of the movie.       Briliantly acted and produced, The Boy In The Striped Pajamas is meant to be accessible to younger viewers, so not all of the Nazi brutalities are shown as graphically as they might otherwise be, but it's still a harrowing watch in many places, and the clearly implied incidents are as effective as anything shown outright.  Upsetting and with a large focus on humanity's worst side, it also focuses often on far brighter or more positive aspects, including Bruno and Shmuel's friendship and also the reactions of certain other characters.  In the days when the commander's wife thinks the camp is merely a labour camp (as if that wouldn't be bad enough) with reasonably decent living conditions (at one point we see several characters viewing a Nazi propaganda film about the camps, depicting the workers happily going about basic chores during the day and gathering at night for socialization, entertainment, and dining - a ridiculously far cry from the reality, but very similiar to what the Nazi government actually put in its real-life propaganda) she gets to know some of the prisoners who are forced to work around the family estate, and starts to question what life is really like for these people on the other side of the fence.  Bruno's mother is one of the characters who's more sympathetic toward the Jewish people from the beginning, and even as Bruno starts to realize what's really going on, his mother is beginning to figure out the same conclusions on her own.         All in all, it's a dark and uncomfortable watch, but one in which certain moments of beauty and power continue toshine through.  One of the most powerful World War II films ever made, and an extremely moving tale.

B002YIHO7I|4.0|Sade is back and she is probably the only artist that could release a CD that I would buy without hearing a single song from it. But I DID hear \\"Soldier of Love\\" in December and instantly fell in love with it. It went without saying that I would pre-order her CD as soon as I got the opportunity, and that's just what I did.<br /><br />This CD is really not as bad as some of the reviewers are labeling it, and I do like it. However, it will be an offering that some other folks will probably have to listen to several times before it grows on them. As others have said, SOLDIER OF LOVE does sound like retreading over the formula used on LOVERS ROCK, which is my least favorite Sade CD because I only liked the first four cuts on it and not much more. But SOLDIER is significantly better than that one. For those people complaining about how the subject matter is \\"depressing\\" and \\"dark\\" - get over it. Unless you just became a fan of Sade's yesterday, then you know good and well that she has ALWAYS sang songs like these. Because of the lyrical content of much of her repetoire, she earned the title of a modern day Billie Holiday a long time ago. This is music that refuses to sugarcoat the fact that as good as love can be, it can also bring pain - and it's something that can happen at ANY age. SOLDIER is smooth, relaxing and classy as anything by Sade is - but I have to admit I'm just a tiny bit disappointed, and I'll explain why later in my review.<br /><br />The most solid and enjoyable selections, IMO, are the edgy title song and best tune on the CD, \\"Soldier of Love\\", the mournful \\"The Moon and The Sky\\", the lovely reggae-influenced \\"Babyfather\\", the folksy-ness of \\"Be That Easy\\", \\"In Another Time\\" (two exceptionally good tunes which both sound like they are going into Norah Jones and John Mayer territory), \\"Bring Me Home\\" and \\"Skin\\", where the track echoes the Sade of old that we all fell in love with. The remaining songs are just okay. \\"The Safest Place\\" is a pale copy of the band's earlier gem, \\"Pearls\\", but it didn't move me as much as \\"Pearls\\" did (and still does). \\"Morning Bird\\" (musically touches on the \\"Pearls\\" vibe again) and \\"Long Hard Road\\" are alright, nothing spectacular or groundbreaking about them but they are decent. I also miss the excellent saxophone work of Stu Matthewman - it only shows up sporadically on \\"In Another Time\\".<br /><br />I will always love Sade's music. I feel that she is one of the few artists left in the industry that is the real deal, and she's one to always keep you wanting more. Not many singers could completely drop off the radar for a decade and still come back strong (although I do wish a lot of today's so-called entertainers would drop off the radar permanently). However, I feel a little cheated, only getting ten songs after ten years. You'd think that since Sade always seems to take a long hiatus between CD releases, she and the band could have come up with more material and even tighter compositions than what we got here. I will never say that she has lost \\"it\\" because she hasn't, but perhaps now she might be at a place musically in her 51 years of life where she doesn't feel it is necessary to rehash the same formula she had in the '80s and '90s. But yet, she created something here that is merely a better version of her last studio CD. If you're a Sade fan like I am, then I definitely recommend it. But if you're just a casual fan you might want to go with the CD single of \\"Soldier of Love\\" instead and hope that we don't have to wait another ten years to get more quality material from her.r gem, \\"Pearls\\", but it didn't move me as much as \\"Pearls\\" did (and still does). \\"Morning Bird\\" (musically touches on the \\"Pearls\\" vibe again) and \\"Long Hard Road\\" are alright, nothing spectacular or groundbreaking about them but they are decent.

It gets the job done, it's just a tad counter-intuitive.  Other than that, I have enjoyed every episode.

1906694141|4.0|Stief Larsson's novels revolve around the character of Lisbeth Salanter, and every scene that doesn't involve her is flat or simply a set-up for her actions later. I'm not sure I understand the immense attraction of the Millennium series except to experience the wasp-quick domination and slyness Lisbeth suddenly has at key moments. The Girl Who Played with Fire is apparently titled after an incident involving Lisbeth as a girl, and it comes so quickly in the book it takes your breath away. But the story line itself and its revealed relationships are, to this reviewer, clumsy. The book has contradictory effects and is imbalanced, yet no one can argue that the eerie attraction of Lisbeth  redeems the story line.

B002YIHO7I|2.0|In the beginning, Sade was a group that put great effort and Pride (pun intended) into instrumentation, creating a rich and lush sound that combined the best of smooth jazz, R&B, soul and even older genres of jazz. I looked forward just as much to Stuart Matthewman's sax and guitar solos as I did Sade Adu's voice. But I also noticed a trend during the course of their albums - each album was slightly more minimalist than the last.     Diamond Life and Promise were musical Tour de Forces that layered rhythms, harmonies, solos and excitement. They were actually too complex to just put on at night and meditate to. Then came Stronger than Pride, and we saw the beginning of the trend to streamline the music section. It was still a strong album, but it was definitely beneath Diamond Life and Promise. And the grooves, even though they lacked the sophistication of arrangement that the previous two albums had, were upbeat and addictive. To someone who followed the path of Sade in real time, it was easy to just look at it as their inevitable movement more towards R&B and less towards Jazz.    If Stronger than Pride flirted with R&B, Love Deluxe was a full out affair. Love Deluxe continued Sade's path away from emphasizing instrumentation and for the first time introduced the very thing that would later become their undoing (in my eyes) - the \\"two chord\\". The \\"two chord\\" is a song that consists of, as the name implies, just two chords, or multiple chords that follow just two modes. The song goes up a chord for a few bars, then comes back down. Then up again, then down again. Sade introduced the two chord to their discography with Bulletproof Soul.    So was Love Deluxe a bad album? No, actually. In fact, it's a great album. It's the Sade album I probably listen to the most. In fact, I love Bulletproof Soul in all of its trip-hop prototype glory! And that's why I didn't identify the warning signs beforehand. Love Deluxe's strength was in its simplicity. It was sexy, it grooved and it \\"swinged\\". And when a beat is sexy, groovy and swings, then it can be forgiven for being an endless loop of one or two chords.    And that brings me to Lovers Rock - when it all started falling apart.    I don't know exactly what happened. Did Sade get together and say, \\"Man, I can't believe how easy it was to make Love Deluxe. We've got to do this again\\"? I don't know. But they removed the elements of instrumentation completely from Lovers Rock. No more solos, no more instrumentals, very little jazz. Completely digital rhythm section, completely engineered, and filled with two chord songs. The difference from Love Deluxe, however, is that it also lacked the groove and the swing that makes such affronts forgivable. For all the simplicity of Bulletproof Soul, it enveloped and hypnotized you. It bewitched and entranced you, like a Deep House song. Lovers Rock had no such effect. Rather than hypnotizing you, it served more to put you to sleep. You didn't focus on the songs the way you did in her earlier albums (especially her first two) - now the songs blend into the background of whatever you're doing at the time you're listening to the music. Only occasionally do you remember that an album is playing.    Unfortunately, Soldier of Love continues that trajectory with an even slower album, and therefore takes them further and further away from what made them great. The initial track, The Moon and the Sky, is the strongest of the entire album, although like every other song on the album, suffers from the two chord syndrome in parts. But it swinged, and that made it OK.    I knew there were dark storms on the horizon when I heard the title track on the radio the past couple of months. I suppose it's entirely a matter of personal taste, but I've never been a fan of \\"theme\\" songs, where the instruments and vocals and lyrics all converge to create a thematic effect, like rush hour traffic, or life in space, or in this case, war. It's all too \\"video game soundtrack\\" forme, as though I've reached the stage where I have to defeat the Ottomans and liberate the Armenians before something bad that nobody will acknowledge today happens to them.    Soldier of Love is the exception to the formula followed by every other song on this album, which veers between pale imitations of Pearls and the increasingly common two chorders. Sure, there was the \\"caribbean\\" variety of the two chorder, and the \\"R&B\\" variety of the two chorder, but few of them grooved (exceptions being Bring Me Home and the aforementioned Moon and the Sky), and they all blended into the background.     This album is more befitting Deep Forest than vintage Sade.    Listen, I understand a tendency sometimes to idealize one's favorite artist, and in the process demonize people critical of that artist as somehow \\"not getting it\\" or \\"not being sophisticated enough\\" to understand the nuances or being dismissed as a non-fan better suited listening to Katy Perry. I wrote this rather lengthy review to establish my bona fides as a Sade fan and show that I do love the group, I do understand the group, and I do know good music when I hear it. But part of being a Sade fan is being objective and honest in determining how an album stacks up to previous efforts. If you're a true Sade fan, you have an obligation to listen to it objectively, and not to play it while subconsciously playing Promise in your head. Do you remember the first time you heard Smooth Operator and how you would hum it to yourself in the shower for weeks/months/years afterwards? Have you hummed any of the songs from this album yet? That's all you need to know.    Ultimately, I'm not sure how an objective Sade fan could listen to this and think it ranks as a peer to Diamond Life, Promise or even Love Deluxe. And I say that with a heavy heart as a lifelong Sade fan.
1427201439|3.0|This work is very much a product of the 1960's and, though set in the distant future, appears somewhat quaint in 2010.    Indeed, it is odd to see characters with the technology to travel through space but without cell phones or computers.  Social and political organization is akin to early medieval times and totally remote of any democratic pretence. There are human servants about and no signs whatsoever of robots.  For reasons that are beyond me, as if in the theatre, knives and poison constitute weapons of choice.    The audio book's production is far from outstanding: various actors are called upon to impersonate the many characters and all are not equally convincing.  The problem may lie in the direction as the tone changes often considerably from one to the other. Possibly, the different parts were taped separately and edited together subsequently.    Contrary to my expectations, this work stands no comparison with the Lord of the Rings series in terms of imagination, depth or significance.  Some may however find it entertaining.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|My husband and I are hooked on Fringe.  He was really thrilled to open this gift.  He didn't start to watch the program until this year, so we caught up on all the characters by watching last season, while we DVR'd the new episodes.  We then watched them in chronicalogic order.  It was great!

1416550534|4.0|I really enjoy Kate Morton's writing. She's descriptive yet not overly wordy. She writes beautiful prose that allows for slow development of plot. I do think that the book could have been trimmed down by 50 pages or so, but I found the characters interesting and I honestly was surprised at the end of the novel. She builds to the suspenseful conclusion by dropping hints steadily throughout the novel. Unlike other British mysteries that read like a math formula, Kate Morton writes a mystery that is fully-developed within historical context that becomes an interesting portrayal of the time period.<br />While I liked this novel, I still prefer \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" by the same author. I think I may have to read everything she writes in the future because I'm hooked. In that sense, this book was not a let down.

I am a huge Raymond Herrera fan, so I was irked to hear they were doing an album without him, however Gene Hoglan (SYL/Dethklok/Dark Angel....the guy has been around..) is amazing and is probably the ONLY person who could step in on this...

B002XUL6QC|5.0|If Lola Montes were alive today I'm sure she would be a tabloid sensation or perhaps a reality television star famous for her notoriety. Born Eliza Gilbert, she reinvented herself during the late 1800s and tried her hand at singing, acting and dancing - failing miserably at all three. What she lacked in talent, however, she more than made up for in sex appeal. Rumours swirled around her about various lovers and Bavaria's Ludwig I bestowed upon her the title of Countess of Landsfeld. She challenged her critics to duels and dared to smoke in public.<br /><br />In short, Montes led a pretty exciting life ripe for cinematic treatment. Director Max Ophuls took up the challenge in what would be his last film and the only one in colour and Cinemascope. When Lola Montes was released in 1955, the critics savaged it causing the film's producers to panic and re-edit it. The film did have its admirers, chief among them filmmaker Francois Truffaut and critic Andrew Sarris. By 2008, Lola Montes was restored to Ophuls' original intentions and digitally remastered to its original glory, preserving its vibrant colour scheme.<br /><br />The first disc includes an audio commentary by film scholar Susan White, author of The Cinema of Max Ophuls. She states that Lola Montes is not a film for everyone because of the unusual attention to style. She discusses the odd casting of Martine Carol and what she brought to the film. White does an excellent job of analyzing the film's style and what it means in relation to the characters and the story. She also sheds light on the film's rocky production. This is a very informative track full of insight into the film and the people that made it.<br /><br />The second disc starts with \\"Cineastes de Notres Temps,\\" an episode of the French television series featuring several of Ophuls' collaborators, many of whom worked on Lola Montes. The film's cinematographer talks about the director's love of movement. In fact, everyone talks about his working methods and obsession with movement within film.<br /><br />\\"Max by Marcel\\" is a 2009 short film by Marcel Ophuls (Max's son) where he talks about his work on the film as an assistant director. Marcel interviews a few people who also worked on the film. The producers did not like the footage Ophuls was shooting forced Martine Carol and the use of colour and Cinemascope on him.<br /><br />\\"Martine Carol Hair Tests\\" features silent footage of the actress showing some of the fantastic hairstyles she sports in Lola Montes.<br /><br />Finally, there is the rerelease trailer.ovement within film.    \\"Max by Marcel\\" is a 2009 short film by Marcel Ophuls (Max's son) where he talks about his work on the film as an assistant director.

B000YRY8BG|5.0|State of Play by BBC miniseries is the best thing I've ever seen on TV.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that it ended.  It was given to me by one of my sisters who loved it.  Though it is six one-hour episodes, I watched this with my husband and mother over the course of three days...we were totally addicted.  It was suspenseful and quite humorous in parts in addition to being a great murder mystery.  I am buying this for my other sister as I know she will love it, too.  I recommend watching this before watching the movie State of Play with Russell Crowe.
1423113497|5.0|A page turner because of the imaginative scope.  I like imaginative and this one takes the cake for coming up with non-standard action that sucks you in, and there is crack up (humor) from every sector.  Set in our world while reading except through Percy's eyes.  And seriously, it's not too intense in any serious emotional way, but has a ton of challenges, so you get no drag whatsoever.    Again, I read 125+ books a year so I know it when I read it, and this IT, is it.      And lastly, this is well written and young readers will not have trouble with readability...  Kids of all ages love it.
B003102JDM|4.0|Ethan and Joel Coen continue to make films that make the audience scratch their heads even while they are laughing in response to situations and dialogue they don't clearly understand. That is part of the beauty of the Coen brothers' films.  They are conundrums, perhaps, but highly skilled and polished ones.  They are an acquired taste.<br /><br />A SERIOUS MAN has a fascinating overture  - a dark drama in Yiddish about a curse, a dybbuk ('In Jewish folklore, a disembodied human spirit that must wander restlessly, burdened by former sins, until it inhabits the body of a living person') and then plops us down in Minneapolis in a Jewish neighborhood inhabited by a strange group of folk - Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) who copes with the inanities of teaching Physics while coping with a venomous Korean student unhappy with his failing grade, an inane tenure committee, a son readying himself for Bar MItzvah while running from his dope dealer, a redneck neighbor on one side and a vamp on the other side of his home that is being torn apart by a wife wanting a Jewish style divorce to marry Larry's best friend and a brother who is a live-in raunch, among other distractions.  Somehow winding through these 'curses' we get to know the real serious man and all the foibles that mark life among these weird characters.  It is very funny at times, goes on a bit long at others, but the film is echt-Coen, and for most that is probably enough.  They do have their style!  Grady Harp, February 10

0140277447|4.0|As a historian, books of this type are important because they challenge the status quo of the established academic ideal.  Chang's little book is by no means revolutionary in the field of history, but it is important.  The history of the Nanking massacre is one that the Japanese have obscured to save face.  You could search Amazon.com right now and even find a few versions of the events at Nanking written from the Japanese perspective, and very quickly discover that Chang and Japanese historians differ widely on what exactly happened in Nanking for the six weeks following December 13, 1937.<br /><br />As a human being, it is impossible to read this account without being affected by the story of thousands of innocent lives perishing at the hands of others, who then escaped justice. As emotional as the account may be, all of Chang's facts seem to line up correctly, and her analysis of the statistics of the massacre seem to be handled fairly and with due compensation given (her research is solid). Whatever the biases of the author, she makes clear attempts to show that the higher estimates for the total number killed at Nanking are not ridiculous at all, but actually quite logical. Her argument is that the rape of Nanking was historically obscured because of various socio-political factors immediately after WWII, and that not all of the perpetrators of the crimes were brought to justice. Both of those arguments are clearly and logically supported, with a minimum of emotional hysterics (a very difficult thing to do, especially concerning the topic and Chang's Chinese background).<br /><br />Not only do I recommend this book because of its information about the Nanking massacre, I recommend it because it is a very revealing look at how war and politics can warp the morals of any man, and it is a very detailed look at the darker side of human nature; a look at man with his civilization stripped off him.

B002RVZV9K|4.0|Overall, this was an excellent documentary on the electric guitar, with interpretations and discussions by at least 2 well known musicians.  It was satisfying to see the verbal interplay between them, as well as snippets of them informally jamming together.  Clearly, out of the 3, the world class 'guitar god' Jimmy Page deserved to be there the most.  He is, by far, the most innovative, progressive, and revered of the 3.  The Edge is a good player too, as he was in one of the bands that help propel the 'new wave' (as it was called then), or 'alternative' movement with his interesting playing.  And although I liked Jack White the personality, I couldn't help asking myself just what in God's name is Jack White doing up there with such accomplished veterans like Page and The Edge?!  In my opinion, as a guitarist, he is nothing special.  In fact, I find his playing extremely boring.  Even if you're into throwback blues and pared down playing, there are many who surpass him by far (Rory Gallagher, Roy Buchanan, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Robert Cray, etc.).  But of course, I realize the producers had to find some one in that realm who is not deceased, and fairly popular with the current generation.

0099408392|5.0|Where the Wild Things Are was published nearly fifty years ago and won the Caldecott Medal for the Most Distinguished Picture Book of the Year. It has won several other awards, and it is clearly evident why. I remember enjoying Where the Wild Things Are a great deal during my elementary years so I decided to read it to my girls this morning. I have a four year old and a seven year old, and both of them were entertained by the read. They laughed out loud at times and weren't scared in the least bit. Where the Wild Things Are shows a boy named Max misbehaving and then being sent to his room without dinner. While Max is in his room he imagines to sail to a land where the wild things are. Although the wild things have sharp teeth and claws, they are actually pretty cute. The self-absorbed, but creative Max is crowned king of all wild things, but later imagines to sail back to his room after smelling good things to eat. The story ends with Max's warm and yummy supper waiting for him on a table. Reading this book to your children gives you the opportunity to teach them about obedience, stewardship, love, our choice of words, consequences, our imagination, grace and more. I hope to watch the movie soon.

0141030933|4.0|Pat Barker's novel, Regeneration, part of the Regeneration Trilogy, is mostly based in a military psychiatric hospital during World War I. Although the book is slow to start, it picks up soon after the first fifteen pages or so. The entire novel is based on four main themes: insanity, emasculation, parenting, and sexual orientation. Throughout the novel, however, Barker focuses on revealing the atrocities of war, as well.    There are multiple non-fictional characters in this novel -- in fact, there are more historical figures than there are fictional characters. Barker seems to make these characters her own throughout the course of the four main parts of Regeneration. Sassoon, a disgruntled \\"conchie\\" (or conscientious objector) and a historical figure, has a mind well beyond the grasp of psychiatry at the time. Dr. W. H. R. Rivers, a non-fictional character and the head psychiatrist at the hospital where the book takes place, is seen as a father-figure by the majority of his patients. These characters she crafts from these real-life people seem to take a life of their own.    Since this book is one of a trilogy, the ending does not seem to sum up each of Barker's adapted characters completely. We are left at the end with a sense of something missing, though we cannot identify what we are lacking. This novel is a quick read, however, despite the fact that there is no real identifiable climax.
B000003H34|4.0|This album was something of a revelation for me, as the last thing from Anathema before this was \\"Serenades\\", which, while good, certainly did not capture my imagination in the way this album did.  When I first heard this I was still expecting some variant on classic British death doom but the signs were definitely there that they were moving away from that sound and progressing somewhere far more interesting.  Obviously, the biggest change to the band were Vincent taking on vocal duties.  But stylistically there was more variance as well, more use of clean guitar, more creative use of feedback and other little embellishments that become more obvious on later albums.  I do find that I don't listen to this album as much as others in their back catalogue these days, but it did sustain a rather lengthy rotation through my CD player at the time.  I have given this album an overall 4 stars as it is a good, but realistically it is probably a 3.5 star album,.  It's hard to say that, but, realistically, they did improve and change so far from here that it would be hard to give the album a higher review, in light of that.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|I have had this turntable for a couple of months now and have had success using it. I would like to point out that this turntable DOES work with a Mac - it states in the technical specs here that it doesn't. After doing a little research, I was able to get it working well. The trick is to set your sound input correctly in the system preferences - after plugging it into the USB, make sure to select \\"USB audio codec\\" in the system preferences. Download the Audacity software [...] and any other extension that you might want. There are also a couple of options in Audacity to set up in the preferences. Play with these settings and you will be in business. One other note to make here is that you will not be able to hear it until you are actually recording it in Audacity software. Just start the recording before the needle is down - edit out the extra time on the front end after it finishes.
B00013VHI0|5.0|Firstly, I must share a weakness.  I love music with a story.  Whether that is a few songs tied together, or a fully fledged concept double album, I am always more susceptible to that album and it is more likely to end up as a favourite.  That is what happened when this album came out.  I remember not knowing what to expect when this album came out, as their last two full length albums had showed quite significant difference in their music.  This was definitely more art oriented than anything they had done before.  Right from the start I was hooked.  And that is rare.  Normally my more favoured albums, over a long period of time, are those that took some time and, more importantly, effort, to get.  Not so with Alternative 4.  Right from the start I found this an album that I could listen to, from start to finish.  The songs and moods ebb and flow and tell the story so very well.  If I had to pick a top three tracks off the album, I would probably go for Fragile Dreams, Alternative 4, and Regret.  But this by no means diminishes the other songs.  I still feel that the production could have been slightly better, but this one of those albums, that for me, the music is that strong that the production would have to be a lot worse to take a star away from the rating.
0451530977|5.0|Treasure Island is without doubt one of the masterpieces of world literature. It's enduring appeal to generations of adventure loving boys (big and small) is sufficient proof. I have read this book many times including even in Latin (yes, there is such an edition: [[ASIN:1449562671 Insula  Thesauraria (Latin Edition)]]) and still find it an exciting read. After all, what could be more appealing than a tale of vicious pirates, a fabulous treasure and a journey into the unkown across exotic seas? Another exciting book is [[ASIN:1449594565 The Drum]], equally suitable for young readers by AEW Mason.
B000055X3U|5.0|I never knew what to expect when this album came out.  It sort of took me by surprise actually, because I had not been paying attention to music news at the time, so seeing it in the stores was unexpected.  Based on the last few albums by this band, I had no idea what direction they would turn, expecting, if anything, a reduction in distorted guitars and a further concentration of atmospherics.  Well, no, not really.  This album is a lot heavier than Alternative 4, but it is by no means a doom album or even metal still.  Without a coherent concept, this time, the songs were allowed to shine for themselves.  And shine they did.  To alot of people this is the album where Anathema got it all right, songs and production all gelling together to make a remarkable record, start to finish.  Vincent's vocals had improved immeasurably over where he started with Silent Enigma.  The guitar parts, even though heavy, were well thought out and executed, conveying both subtlety and power when required.  All parts on this album, combined so very well, to the point where instrument was so strong it ruined the effect of any other instrument.  Three top picks off the album:  One Last Goodbye, Judgement and Anyone, Anywhere.

B00005JLCI|5.0|Whatever your views on different versions of Hamlet on film (and there are lots of them), this one is a must, a benchmark. In addition to its excellent, well-known actors (including Kate Winslet's debut), it gives us every line of Shakespeare's original. In other words, this is a great starting point and/or reference point for viewing other versions, and a major achievement by the directing team.      The commentary is also very good, and well-worth listening to as you go through the play. All in all, an excellent DVD.

0385340575|3.0|This Reacher book, the 12th, was better by far than Divine Justice, the previous volume. Jack's back on track with more of a mystery in New York City, finding his usual ease in working with a (naturally pretty) police officer, whom, as usual, he beds before the book ends. This relationship/one-night-stand is probably the most gratuitous of all the romantic encounters Jack has had, does nothing for the story except annoy me, as if the author feels that if Jack doesn't get the girl in bed at least once, the adventure isn't complete. Otherwise it's a comfortable read, with a familiar character that you know will win out in the end. Not challenging, but enjoyable.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|In a TV field already clogged with one-hour mystery sitcoms, what Castle adds is a working cop's angle, a blue collar procedural grit.  No necktied PI coming in when the dirty work is already done here.  No, this story centers on a precinct building full of clock-punching police working at uncomfy desks surrounded by sweating cinder blocks.  This is a mystery sitcom that works for a living.<br /><br />In some ways, this show follows the formula.  There's the daffy intruder who upsets everyone's apple cart, the sexual tension probably destined to go unresolved, the compulsory wisecracks, and the slowly unearthed secrets beneath the characters' cool exteriors.  What makes this show great is not that it does anything new, but that it does everything well.<br /><br />The physical design of the show is spectacular.  Breeze-block buildings, alleys, and cracked pavements emphasize just how workaday this world is.  Characters dress with panache, but it's clear that they shop at the mall rather than having a wardrobe team.  Stana Katic is sexy without having to slink, and Nathan Fillion has the manfulness of a guy who doesn't mind a second helping of dessert.  You could imagine walking into this world.<br /><br />And though the murders are elaborate enough that you couldn't imagine this sort of thing really happens that often, they aren't so elevated that they look silly.  The cops have to dig out clues slowly, and often have to let the title character break rules for them if they hope to get to the bottom of the case.  Once again, the procedural angle emphasizes that fighting crime is work, not constant clam.<br /><br />As much as I've enjoyed this series, I must warn you that the special features are mostly lame.  I enjoy the episode commentary, and the commentators offer insights into how an episodic crime comedy is made.  But the short featurettes on Disc 3 were obviously done up by the design team to have something to stick on the DVD.  Skip the special features.<br /><br />Though this is a short run on a midseason replacement, it's a slick, funny, engaging dramedy that will draw in a diverse audience.  Smart and playful, charming and tense, this is what more mystery sitcoms ought to be.  And it's just plain fun.season replacement, it's a slick, funny, engaging dramedy that will draw in a diverse audience.

B002RKSXJG|4.0|I'd never heard of Wilkie Collins before I got my Kindle. In searching out free classics, I of course found a number of references to this classic mystery. I inferred from the title that the woman in white was a ghost (who knows why!) so fully expected some specter to rise out of the misty moors. Instead, I was surprised to find myself in the grip of a diabolical and tragic tale told by several different and distinct voices. While a tad overlong - why use one word when you can use six? - my thumb rarely left the Next Page button. I had no desire to 'cheat' on Walter, Laura, Marion, Anne, the Baronet and Fosco with another book, and in fact could barely put down my Kindle until I could no longer keep my eyes open in the wee hours of the night. Collins was a genius at keeping the reader guessing, which I did throughout. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, Collins read my thoughts and threw me a curveball. And though the language is very old-fashioned and formal - think 19th century England - I had few troubles figuring out the odd unfamiliar phrase. Of course, it was tough not to chuckle at the quaint and genteel 'evils' that seem so commonplace today, but it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book. If anything, it added to it. After reading - and thoroughly enjoying - The Woman in White, I can clearly understand why this classic has endured.<br /><br />A note on Kindle formatting: I have seen reviews of other Kindle freebies that were badly formatted and/or edited, but that was not the case with this book. Not only were there few (if any) typos, the formatting was quite readable. The one addition I would have liked is a linked table of contents. If you find a 99 cent version that boasts such a TOC, I'd recommend buying it instead of downloading it for free as I would have like to have looked back at different characters' accounts after reading them.<br /><br />If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!ton below!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Sifting through the lifeless rubble of a fallen civilization, a small unprepossessing scavenger robot named \\"Wall-E\\" dutifully fulfills his repetitive tasks.  Watching how he sets certain items aside, and then later uses them for his own purposes, we begin to get a sense that Wall-E has a level of freedom and personality that is not traditionally associated with robots.  He does not have much to say, however, until he meets another creature, somewhat like himself, the beautiful and frightening Eve.  Eve has come from the stars to pursue her own vocation: searching for life on the devastated planet.  Sleek and polished as she is, Wall-E falls for her immediately, even though she has no interest in a creature as insignificant as he.  Wall-E's longing to be with his beloved Eve drives the rest of film through an exciting adventure that impacts the future of the entire planet and even the degenerate human race.<br /><br />The animation is just breathtaking during the opening sequences, levels off a bit as the story leaves the planet and goes on board ship, but still maintains a very high quality throughout. The story - as much a love story as a science-fiction/fantasy - is sweet, funny, and emotionally engaging for both kids and adults alike, and featuring graphics this impressive, Wall-E is well worth getting to know.  Superb.

B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Just when the genre looks like it's as cold as a mackerel, along comes \\"Brick,\\" the kind of film I'd fund if I hit the lottery, just to see it on the screen. I cannot believe I haven't seen Rian Johnson directing a \\"major\\" after this one. I saw a preview for this film on another dvd and that put the hook in. This is convoluted dialogue and plot worthy of Dashiel Hammet. Exactly the sort of film I bought a Prime membership to buy.
0684824906|4.0|Team of Rivals is a sparkling history by anecdote.  Kearns is a masterful writer, and the book puts the breath of life into her subjects.    Her theme is best summed up by the remarks of Lincoln's contemporaries, quoted on page 572 of the hardback edition:    \\"Herein, Swett concluded, lay the secret to Lincoln's gifted leadership.  'It was by ignoring men, and ignoring all small causes, but by closely calculating the tendencies of events and the great forces which were producing logical results.'  John Forney of the Washington Daily Chronical observed the same intuitive judgment and timing, arguing that Lincoln was 'the most progressive man of the age, not waiting to be dragged by the force of events or wasting strength in premature struggles with them.'\\"    As far as the story of a man always guided by principle--in Lincoln's last battle, to ramrod the Thirteenth Amendment through Congress--Kearns shows Lincoln twisting arms, dangling emollients and largess before its opponents, and dissembling if not outright lying--to successfully obtain its passage.  Clearly Lincoln could be savagely expedient, despite being guided by an unswerving moral compass.      But although she is always eager to burnish Honest Abe's reputation when it is clearly earned--Kearns is strangely silent on this account.  This is not to dismiss the book as hagiography, but simply to point out that it is not entirely even in its judgments.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|Sunshine is really one of the best unknown movies of the past decade. I remember seeing a trailer for it once when I saw another movie at the theater. After that, I never saw a single advertisement of any kind for the movie. It really is a shame the way this movie was left largely unknown, because it really is a beautiful thing to behold. There are some amazing visuals, an amazing soundtrack, and some great acting. I was really surprised to see some great acting out of Chris Evans after having seen him in fairly crap roles in Fantastic Four and Not Another Teen Movie. I was really excited to see Hiroyuki Sanada here because I loved him in The Last Samurai. Then, of course, is the always great Michelle Yeoh of Crouching Tiger and Tomorrow Never Dies fame. The real star here, though, is Cillian Murphy. This guy is just a great actor. I loved him in 28 Days Later, and he definitely brings his A game in Sunshine. John Murphy and Underworld put together the most moving and awesome original soundtrack I think I have ever heard.<br /><br />The movie itself is really enjoyable for me because of the stunning visuals, and because of the different take on Sci-Fi. It's not an extremely scientifically accurate movie (though there is a great commentary by a physicist that talks about the science in the movie), but it is a very emotionally powerful movie. It really is more of an exploration of the emotional and psychological ramifications of having the largest responsibility a person could ever have. The crew is on a mission that has the highest possible stakes for humanity, and there is a good range of effects that this has on the different crew members. A lot of people will dislike this movie for scientific reasons, but I love it as a visual, audible, and emotional experience, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who may be interested.
B0024F08RO|5.0|Prison Break is by far the best TV Series I have ever seen in my life. It is beyond what you think could ever happen. Eric & Rachael give it 2 thumbs up!
0743578171|4.0|This CD was a hoot!  Now, I did not see the movie version, so this review is strictly regarding the audiobook.  I am the Queen of a land called Insomnia, so I buy lots of CD's to keep my brain occupied in the wee hours, while my husband snores blissfully beside me.  This regimen of mine works best when the CD is entertaining, absorbing, or simply a tickle to the funny bone.  In the case of \\"He's Just Not That Into You,\\" I was pleasantly surprised, so much so that I might actually give in and see the movie.  It's sort of like watching the early weeks of American Idol, when you say \\"How can someone be that clueless?\\" except that in this case it has to do with being clueless as to the signals someone is sending when the relationship is not working.  So, if you're looking for some light-hearted humor about intimate relationships (and not, say, a scientific psychological study), then pick up this CD, plug in your earphones, giggle a bit and relax.
1400052173|5.0|This review will probably make some people angry, but I'll proceed anyway because these issues need to be addressed as there is a correlation between all of the events I am about to mention.....    I was first introduced to the life of Henrietta Lacks during my African American History course in college. The epic journey of Henrietta's life is priceless, as the cells of her DNA continues to be used in medical breakthroughs for curing many diseases and saving lives, her cells were even sent outer space to conduct studies of how her cells would react to the environment - and the cells of her DNA continued to multiply while outer space! Scientific research and medical experimentation revealed THE UNIQUE STRAIN OF DNA CONTAINED IN HENRIETTA IS CONTAINED IN ALL BLACK PEOPLE AND NO OTHER RACE ON THE PLANET!      Now I will mention other issues which are linked to Henrietta's situation:       The global eugenics program, involving eugenicists such as Gregor Mendel, Charles B. Davenport (An American supporter of Eugenics), President Calvin Coolidge, Adolph Hitler, Francis Galton, and the like, was based on their definition of certain people and certain races of people who they falsely claimed to have \\"predisposed genetic deficiencies\\". Part of their ASSumption was that the black race was inferior, and their aim was to sterilize all black people in order to curtail the growth of the black population worldwide. As for Calvin Coolidge, his opinion was, \\"America must be kept American. Biological laws show that Nordics deteriorate when mixed with other races\\". Their eugenics movement transpired into what is known today as Planned Parenthood, which was founded by eugenicist Margaret Sanger. As we all know, there are thousands of Planned Parenthood facilities located throughout the United States, and similar agencies worldwide. The irony of these diabolical eugenicists is while their aim was/is to reduce the black population, the strain of cells from the DNA of black fetuses fromPlanned Parenthood are used without the patient's permission for the same madical purposes as what was done to Henrietta Lacks.     Experiments performed with the strain of DNA from Henrietta also created what we all know today as stem cell research. Before the ban of stem cell research that was recently lifted by Obama, researchers discovered the strains of cells from the DNA of black people/black fetuses are the only cells which multiply and thrive successfully. They realized for the cells to thrive successfully, the strain of DNA must come from the original, indigenous people of this planet. This is where philanthropy comes in.....    The heart of focus for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is based on the \\"development of nations\\" in Africa. Bill and Melinda Gates are also aware of the unique strains of DNA found only in black people. So under the guise of \\"philanthropy\\", part of their efforts are going towards what Bill Gates calls \\"DNA sequencing\\". So when you hear Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, or any other philanthropists talking about \\"developing the nations of Africa\\" (or Haiti for that matter), not only is the land up for grabs, but so are the people. DNA sequencing is their way of owning the people of Africa or any other indigenous black people based on our unique strains of DNA. So as a result of \\"DNA sequencing\\", to the likes of what researchers have done with the cells of Henrietta Lacks and other black people, they are selling the unique strains of African DNA for research and profit.     A group of researchers from Emory University received funding for approximately $20 million towards \\"medical research\\" in Ethiopia, which is one of the oldest black civilizations on this planet. Part of their research involves \\"DNA sequencing\\" on the strains of DNA of Ethiopians. Part of the funding they received came from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.     These people are perfectly aware of the fact that all of us are not the same. So before, during, and after the physical life of Henrietta Lacks, the saga continues as these \\"researchers\\" continue to experiment with the unique strains of DNA found only in black people.     Also, the same deceit and disrespect that was done to Henrietta Lacks and other Africans is also happening in Haiti.

B0019IB26I|5.0|John Mayer, simply put, is one of the greatest musicians of this era.  A lot of people may disagree, but the amount of emotions that go into his songs is indisputable.  John Mayer's guitar has a voice of its own; the guitar solo at the end of \\"Slow Dancing in a Burning Room\\" will make the most glorious of all tough guys miss their ex-girlfriends, and bring the rest of us to tears.  John Mayer sounds amazing live, and in a lot of his songs, his live versions sound even better than the actual recordings.  This CD is a great chance to hear what people mean by \\"John Mayer is one of the best performers.\\" Another great thing about this CD is some of the dialogue that's put in with John Mayer and the audience at LA when this was recorded.  You get a little glimpse into who he is, and that's great to hear. Highly recommend this album. It's great.
B0000047D5|5.0|I was sad to read that Mr. Thigpen passed away in January 2010.  So my tribute to this now departed trio is my attempt at reviewing what has to be one of the best recorded jazz albums ever made.    If you are reading this, I am going to assume that you are already familiar with the Oscar Peterson Trio.  As with every album this Trio recorded, you get a little bit of everything.  There is electricity, speed, calmness and joy.  Where this album surpasses the others is in the quality of the recorded tracks.  Whether you have an audiophile quality sound system or computer speakers, you will be able to hear the differences I am attempting to explain.  Ray's bass comes out perfectly from one speaker and the quality is so excellent you can even hear him scatting while he is playing (check out the intro of You Look Good to Me).  Ed's playing issues as perfectly from the opposite speaker.  And I was amazed to hear all the little things that Ed does while playing as opposed to just keeping the beat.  The recording is so clean that you can actually focus your ears to the bass or drum lines or just let Oscar's playing take you away.    If you could care less about hearing the playing of each memeber, have no fear the selection of songs has to be one of the best groupings the Trio every put down on tape.  If you like the samba sound, listen to the Girl from Ipanema; 70's music more to your liking, the Trio covers People; prefer a good ballad, Time and Again will fill that niche and if you just want straight up jazz, I would challenge you to find a better example than Goodbye J.D.    For those that do have an audophile quality system with a turntable, get the re-released vinyl.  It is dynamic.    Why can't the record companies produce music like this any more?  I sure miss those guys.
1932907009|4.0|I'm not so smitten with the legion of \\"how to\\" screenplay books that are essentially just restatements of the same tired formula that hasn't changed since Aristotle.  But of all those formula books, this is most certainly the best.  And that's not intended as a backhanded compliment.      Lord knows we're talking about Hollywood here.  If you think you're going to make it big in Hollywood as a screenwriter by not writing to formula you're kidding yourself (and if you say \\"Tarantino\\", #1: I'll laugh, and #2: I'll tell you he made them himself -- no one in Hollywood would have touched his scripts).  We are talking about Hollywood. There are smart people there and the reason they make such dumb movies is because the film going audience is...well...generally pretty dumb (I apply the 80/20 rule here as in many things -- and there is no huge profit in making films for the 20% who rarely go to the cinema anyway. These people are readers). If you don't know (and obey) \\"The Formula\\" no one will give you the time of day in Hell A.  It's not because they aren't capable of making or recognizing \\"art\\".  It's because art doesn't sell.  And movies are first and foremost a business. If you have a message, it damn well better be sugar coated, or no one is going to swallow it.    So I highly recommend this book over all others as a tutorial for formulaic writing -- the kind movie goers demand. My only gripe is about process.  Time and time again Blake hammers home the notion that you need the structure in place before you write.  I disagree.  Ideas don't come to you fully formed in your head, they come to you when you write -- as part of the writing process.  And for the most part -- they only come to you when you write -- not when you're continually re-arranging your index cards.  Maybe his workflow works for him, and that's fine, but to proffer that workflow as a rule I think does more harm than good.    The time to implement Blake's process, in my opinion, is immediately after your first draft and in the re-write process.  It is only then that you should take what you've written and try and mould it into something that is saleable in tinsel-town.      By all means I think his advice is golden, I only take issue with his workflow.  Either way, I think if a Hollywood screenwriter is what you want to be then you should save yourself a lot of time and hard feelings and not only read this book -- but follow it to the letter.  You can use \\"the formula\\" as a structure either for you initial draft, or as a guide for your re-write. If you find this stifling to your \\"creativity\\" maybe Hollywood isn't the game you really want to be in.    So I give it four stars.  I would give it five if I didn't take issue with the details of his workflow which presents as if it were law.  It's not.  The formula, however, is.  You may not like it, but in Hollywood it is the law -- violate it at your own peril.  Three or four unsold screenplays down the road I promise you you'll come around to Blake's way of thinking anyway -- by sparing you that suffering and inevitable disillusion this book, in my opinion, is worth way more than the cost of admission.

B000RJO578|5.0|I love this movie. It is a fun, funny, and easygoing movie that's a satire of both comedy and horror flicks. Hoity-toity movie critics will probably find it less than adequate in all the typical movie quality categories. But if you just want to have a good laugh from a movie that pokes fun at small town life across the pond, you will certainly enjoy this one. Totally worth the $5 plus shipping I paid for it. Make sure you get the correct Region Code for your purchase of this fine British export.

B002BSHWUU|3.0|We love the music - once we washed all the CDs which had greasy fingerprints on nearly all of them.  How did brand new CD's get fingerprints on them?  What a way to sour a nearly perfect Christmas present.
B001BPJJ9G|2.0|Our parents read to us; my 5th grade teacher read us greek mythology, including the Iliad (or was it the Odyssey?);  I still read, quite a bit.  And I still think this movie would have made a lot of great music videos, or some stunning commercials, but it's a visually compelling yet pathetic movie, and the story telling part is largely what's wrong with it.  A good parallel would be Terry Gilliam's \\"The Adventures of Baron Von Munchausen\\", which was filmed almost entirely on a backlot but whose characters easily carry the movie into the realm of fantasy, and exotic places sometimes fairly cheaply rendered.  This film blows you away with its scenery, yet its characters, aside from Mr. Pace, are mere caricature and cliche.  For almost all of the movie almost none of them utter a complete sentence, but simply stand there as exotic elements in brilliantly colored costumes, contrasted against the scenery around them.  Darwin, dressed something like a bird and talking to a monkey, does get a few lines as does one of the actresses, otherwise the fantasy sequences are mostly posing with voice over.  And, sadly, given all the bare male chests that are quite a nice touch, none of the actors are very convincing as action figures, as when they run down the steps of an ancient tower they are obviously concerned about falling, something you don't see in Errol Flynn, or Johnny Depp as they sparred about in their swashbucklers.<br /><br />Mr. Pace is an injured stuntman in 1920's Hollywood, and he's lost his girlfriend.  So, as he convalesces in a victorian hospital that is our only scene set in Los Angeles (which of course, isn't L.A. at all, but isn't that a wicked turn of events?) he begins to tell these stories to a little girl who is recovering from having her broken arm set in plaster, and in the process he gets her to bring him morphine from the dispensary.  As a character, the girl is meant to be \\"absolutely darling\\" and with her puffy cheeks and missing front teeth, she is.  As an actress, her skills--combined with her age appropriate childishness, and her accent, make the very early Shirley Temple seem utterly brilliant even intellectual.  Oh, and talented.  This little girl has a nifty skill of waving off the lines she's fluffed or forgotten, as if we understand them anyway, and we pretty much do, given that she never really says anything terribly important, she certainly does not carry her weight in the film anywhere near the way the little girl in \\"Baron Von Munchausen\\" served to keep the Baron, and the plot, moving forward.<br /><br />The problem with the stories, here,  is that they never really seem to go anywhere, the more morphine he gets, the less able he is to continue the story line, and since he's a character both within and without, the actual stories don't really advance as much as they sort of progress in a series of incredibly colorful vignettes set either in the desert or in fantastic palaces and temples of the Indian variety.  Baron Von Munchausen sort of wandered through his movie, but all along you were still progressing and had the confidence you would even arrive somewhere, even if, at the end, it wasn't, really...  this film doesn't inspire that confidence, and when you finally get to the end, you realize that the film wanted to be, and was advertised as something far greater than it really was.<br /><br />Still, as much as I want to trash this film for wasting such a great opportunity, it is, again, so utterly beguiling to look at that, that if you can figure a way to have it on without having to actually pay much attention to it as a movie, you really ought to try it out.
0140143505|5.0|This book is one of my all time favorite books.  The book, 84, Charing Chase Road was loaned to me by a friend. I immediately fell in love with the book.  When I had to mail the book back to my friend,  I felt I had lost a good friend.  I was delighted to find it listed on Amazon.com. and thus I ordered it for my library.  The book is composed of  letters written back and forth between Helene Hanff and Frank Doel,a used book dealer. Helen has various needs and inquiries about different books she is interested in (as she is an advid reader).  The book is a  treasure of how a friendship can grow and become meaningful though twenty years of writing letters back and forth. Even though they never meet and they are separated by miles and live in different countries their friendship  continues to grow.  What a beautifully written book about the development of this rare treasure called  \\" friendship of the soul\\".
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Yeah, WOW hardly describes this book.  I don't wish to put out any spoilers, so I won't, but suffice it to say that I haven't seen the movie, though someone at work has.  We talked about the two and I can only say that the two endings (the book and the movie) are completely different!<br /><br />When a book makes you cry, and I do mean boo-hoo crying, at least for me, that's a richly written book, that is a delight to read.  I wasn't the least bit interested in reading this book, because I'd always thought Mr. Sparks' books were \\"mushy,\\" but when it knocked Avatar out at the box office the weekend of 2/6 as advertised on the MSN homepage, well, I just had to read it.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; I've heard that Mr. Sparks writes awesome books, but I've just never been that interested in them...until now.  I want to buy every book he's ever written and have them \\"delivered to my Kindle in under 60 seconds,\\" but I'll have to be happy with this one for now.<br /><br />The characters were richly written, and you felt as though you were there with them.  You felt their joy, happiness, sadness, hearbreak, the entire gamut of their emotions.  To me, that's a book wonderfully written; when you can see the characters, and feel what they're feeling, wow!  The geographic locations were richly described, the personalities of all involved made you feel as though you actually knew them.<br /><br />I kind of felt like a fool as I would sit outside crying; I had to take my hanky with me, and I was afraid I was going to get my beloved Kindle wet.  I was afraid it would short out or something.  When I neared the end, I didn't want my kids to see me crying over a book, so I went to bed with my Kindle and my hanky.  OMG - - I literally boo hooed (is that a word?) into my hanky for some time, and my heart just about burst with anticipation (again, no spoilers from me).  I really wanted the book to go on and on and on and...but all good things must end, and I was saddened when it did.<br /><br />As my title says, \\"Grab Some Tissue!\\" and if you're not embarassed by having your family see you cry, read out in the open, otherwise, you may have to hide out for a bit as you read this book, but believe me, it will be well worth it.<br /><br />Some might say it's the classic boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy goes off to war, boy gets Dear John letter.  Oddly enough, his name is John, so that would stand to reason.  It's much more than the \\"boy meets girl, they fall in love\\" story, and Mr. Sparks gets you involved in that from the beginning, so that makes this a delightful read - - you're part of it, you're in the thick of it, and as you get to know the characters, and as the story unfolds, I think you'll really be glad you read this book.<br /><br />If I could have given it more than 5 stars I would have.  Thank you for reading my review.br /><br />As my title says, \\"Grab Some Tissue!\\" and if you're not embarassed by having your family see you cry, read out in the open, otherwise, you may have to hide out for a bit as you read this book, but believe me, it will be well worth it.<br /><br />Some might say it's the classic boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy goes off to war, boy gets Dear John letter.

B001HN69AY|2.0|I thought going in that the transitions of Ledger to the other handsome devils would be jarring and detract from the enjoyment of the film. For the most part, however, excluding Jude Law who stuck out like a sore thumb, this was not Parnassus' downfall. The magical realism approach benefited the film greatly and helped to disguise the death of the main character in ways I won't explain for fear of ruining some surprise.   Gilliam sure does know how to make an imaginative landscape; CG or not the imagination scenes were pretty cool! Also Tom Waits was pretty fun as the devil. The other actors, for the most part, were forgettable (meaning they get the job done and nothing more) except for Vern Troyer-- who was AWFUL! Really monotone, no inflection...no wonder he never spoke in Austin Powers! Just terrible. His character could have been cut, for all I care. Ugh. Also the pacing of the film was sort-of off. Gilliam, while a master of visual splendor, has always had this problem. The Fisher King, his early 90's \\"masterpiece\\" (I use the term lightly, I prefer \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" or Monty Python shtick personally) fell prey to the same elements of talk-talk-talk, not enough wild, intriguing panache. There were times during this film when I felt excessively bored and just wanted to go \\"back through the mirror\\" as it were.      Also the denouncement lacked bite, when the big reveal of who Ledger's character was and what his motivations were. Ho-hum.      This is just another example (see MirrorMask) of how visual splendor cannot save a movie that has a bad script. Though there were moments of supreme elation such as the first imagination sequence in the forest, the film product felt a bit too cobbled together and ultimately mundane to be regarded as anything but another mediocre Gilliam outing, much in the same vain as the ill-fated Brothers Grimm, which, actually, I enjoyed more than this movie.
B0018BB20W|5.0|If I was on a deserted island and could only have one album, this would be it. I had it as an album in the '60s and bought the CD. This is my favorite of all time. It is very cool how you can picture the times of the day as the album goes on, i.e., the beginning of the day, dawn, morning, noon, afternoon, evening, and night all through music, rock and orchestra, with two way cool short poems in the beginning and at the end. Very well done. Because of the journey it takes you through, I cannot listen to this shuffled. This is one album that will never die.    The only thing is that the CD throws in bonus tracks that do not need to be there because when the music ends with Nights In White Satin in the original version, it stays with you and makes you ponder. They should have released the CD just like the album or given you that option. Unfortunately, they do not sell the CD with just the seven pieces.
B000065V3H|3.0|There wil never be an era like the 80s ever again. And this movie seems to capture the era tremendously. There's nothing funnier than watching the \\"cool kids\\" pick on the nerdy kids in this movie. It was a simpler time in the 80s. The jocks had their own special hall. Now everything is all PC. I want to go back to the old days where the nerds wore glasses with tape on them and pants up to their necks, held up by suspenders. And well, I want to go to any place where they have a collection of women that look like the young ladies in this whopper of a film.  That's not to say this movie is all about hot women. I mean, I have only seen the movie on TV so I can't really speak to the uncensored version. So for you pervs out there, there may more that I missed. In any case, let me get to the point. If you ever find yourself flipping channels on a lazy Saturday afternoon and happen to end up on the Oxygen channel, you won't regret it. The film has it all. The heart-warming moments where you really feel all mushy inside. The light-hearted moments that make you fall out of your chair. And the downright ridiculous moments that make you wonder,\\"There was a director who actually thought this scene was a good idea?\\" Ok kids, that is all. Watch this film on Oxygen channel or Lifetime or whatever channel it may come on.

0375413405|5.0|I purchased this book as a Birthday present for my daughter.  She watched the movie Julie and Julia and really wanted the book.  She told me they cost too much money, about $40.00.  She is a struggling student at a local college and I knew I could get it from Amazon for much less than $40.  I went on-line and right to your website and voila, there it was for only $19.  When the book came in I figured it would be all dog eared, dirty and torn cover, but to my amazement, the book was  pristine.  It was a reprint and an anniversary edition and I was extremely pleased.  I have to wrap it up and wait until early March for the birthday girl to open it, but as always, everything I purchase from Amazon is no less than perfect, even the used books.  Glad you are there for me and I do recommend you every chance I get.  Thanks, Amazon.

0060591714|5.0|My Spanish speaking and reading skills are fairly good, but I need to study more and to practice more. It gets to be drudgery to study textbooks. Reading great Spanish literature requires carrying a huge dictionary and can become too much like work to go through. This and \\"Ciudad de las Bestias\\" were just right for me.<br /><br />The descriptions and the characters where so real that I felt as if I were there. I grew to care about them. Isabelle Allende did her homework with these books and reading them felt nothing in the least like doing _my_ homework. I lost sleep at night because I had to find out what happened next. I won't tell you that.... you'll have to find it out the right way.

B002YIHO7I|3.0|Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Sade fan.  I have every album, know every song by heart, have seen her live.  I have overplayed every CD and loved every one - especially Lovers Rock!  I've been anxiously waiting for this new CD - I even preordered it so I'd have it the day it came out!!  When it arrived, I was so excited.  I put it into the CD player and sat back . . . WOW, the first 4 songs are really good, I thought - this is turning out to be a great CD (like all the others).  But then song 5 through 10 came on and I was really disappointed.  I'm not saying they're bad songs - it's just that they kind of all sound similar.  They're all SUPER mellow (which isn't a bad thing, but when you have super mellow AND they all sound similar - well, there's nothing to keep you interested).  I actually started dozing off!  Then I thought \\"well, that was only my first listen - let me try again.\\"  So I listened to the whole CD two more times (not in the same sitting) - still, I had the same experience.  I thought that after almost 10 years (1 song a year) that she would have come up with something a little more creative.  The Moon and the Sky, Soldier of Love and Babyfather are really good songs, all the others - I can take it or leave it.  I guess after 5 great albums, she's lost some of her creativity . . . makes me a little sad.    ADDENDUM: I have now listened to the CD about 9 times and it has grown on me a little bit.  I still wish she had included a few more slightly up-bead songs though.  It is a very mellow CD so you really have to be in the mood to listen.  I will, however, admit that I do like the CD far more than I did the first few times I listened.
B00005JO20|5.0|One of the most memorable scenes in any movie by anyone ever appears in this re-make of King Kong by Peter Jackson.  They are still in the jungle and Kong is going home, with Anne, finally understanding the ape's intelligence and love, following him.  He climbs up onto his perch in time to view, what he must view every single day, the sunset.  This is no dumb brute, this is the father of our poets and our aesthetes.   And clearly more admirable than any of the representatives of the other primate species in the film.
0451196716|5.0|I am no fan of Stephen King. I don't hate his books, but I think this is the sixth book of his I've read, and the first one I've really enjoyed. I got 80% through [[ASIN:0451169530 The Stand: Expanded Edition: For the First Time Complete and Uncut (Signet)]] before putting it down in boredom. I tried twice to get through [[ASIN:0452284694 The Gunslinger (The Dark Tower, Book 1)]] and failed both times. I've never really understood his appeal and haven't had an interest in reading anything else by him, but when someone told me the premise of The Long Walk - I was so intrigued I had to try it out. After finishing it, I finally got a glimpse into some of the incredible story-telling that King is capable of.<br /><br />Written under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman, the premise of The Long Walk is that America is a different society than what we currently know. On the surface, every aspect of it seems the same with two exceptions. The first, is that there was some type of war or military/government event in the past (which King only alludes to), and second, the premier sporting event is a yearly event known as The Long Walk, in which 100 teenage boys are chosen to walk as long as they can until only one of them is left standing, which is a foregone occurrence since contestants are shot if they slow down too much. The obvious draw to this story is the event itself. Why would anyone choose to compete in it? Well, The Prize is the obvious answer - anything you could want for the rest of your life. But even so, the odds are so overwhelmingly against you it seems insane that anyone would compete. The majority of the book is an exercise in character development. King spends an exhaustive amount of time slowly developing the characters and providing insight into their motivations and backgrounds. The main character, Ray Garraty, is developed through his interactions with his fellow contestants. One of the most interesting concepts about the story, is that these are not professional athletes. These young boys have not spent the last four years training for the Long Walk. King makes no references to their being jocks or physically superior to other average teenage boys. Some of the boys do mention taking practice walks, but it is clear that most of them have never participated in anything like this until they start out that morning in Maine on April 30. The winner of the Long Walk is not gifted with superior physical endurance, but emotional and mental superiority.<br /><br />If King has any other novels like The Long Walk, I would definitely be interested in reading them. It is a very quick read and one that I honestly couldn't put down, as the intrigue never slows down for a minute. I also found that my mind was continually thinking while reading. King would detail a concept or rule of the long walk, such as the rule about outside people interfering with a contestant, and I would sit there and think about all of the different implications that could occur from such a rule. What if a contestant hired someone who had nothing to lose to run out and attach a competitor? Could contestants carry extra shoes with them? What about different ways they could use the bathroom while walking and now slow down? My mind was active the whole time I was reading it, and even after finishing it. I really love when a book challenges me creatively this way, and I'm not just engaged in \\"passive reading.\\" For anyone who wants an exciting and well-developed novel, I would definitely recommend picking up a copy of The Long Walk.thletes.

B002EC3932|5.0|Overview:<br /><br />When I first heard this was going to be a trio and Rudresh Mahanthappa was not going to be playing on the CD I thought this couldn't possibly be as good as Vijay's recent releases.  Vijay and Rudresh have such chemistry ... how could the trio be better?  Well it is.  It is way better.  I love Vijay's prior albums but this one is really special.  Prior to this album I never really heard bassist Crump.  There was too much else going on.  On this format you can really here Marcus Gilmore on drums and Stephen Crump on bass, and they are really good.  And Vijay can fill up space like you wouldn't believe.  Having no other leads gives Vijay lots of room and he romps all over the place. Two other important things to note about this album:  #1 it is very modern and reminds me a bit of E.S.T.  #2  This is the first Vijay Iyer album where it truly is a modern postbop album and not a world music/jazz fusion album.  There is a tinge of world accent on the remake of Trident, but besides that this could just as easily be a modern Scandanavian trio.  While I love the world accent on the previous albums, it is impressive to see Vijay move past something that was successful onto some that is even better.<br /><br />Song Highlights:<br /><br />Dogon A.D. - This track is a modern funky romp.  Bassist Crump opens with the bow on the bass strings and gets down with it.  This really reminds of of E.S.T. ...man i miss them.  Dogon A.D. is an album by Julius Hemphill which was released in 1972.  Vijay really dug deep in history to find this one.  Thank you.<br /><br />Mystic Brew - Vijay reworked a Ronnie Foster song here.  Vijay does these killer staccato appegios that just rock.  It's upbeat and pretty and magical.<br /><br />Galang - very modern tune originaly written by Maya Arulpragasam.  Sounds like an electronica sound adapted to jazz.<br /><br />...  All the songs are good.  I could write more but you get the point.  This is a real gem.  Highest recommendation.  Absoluely essential for Vijay Iyer fans.  The other songs include 4 by Vijay Iyer (2 new, 2 remakes) 1 from West Side Story, 1 by Andrew Hill, and 1 by Stevie Wonder.he other songs include 4 by Vijay Iyer (2 new, 2 remakes) 1 from West Side Story, 1 by Andrew Hill, and 1 by Stevie Wonder.
0307454541|2.0|I am finally giving up, after reading over 200 pages.  I keep waiting for the suspense, the page-turner, but it's not there.  The writing is amateurish.  Just read some of the dialogue in isolation and you'll realize that the characters are cardboard figures, mouthing inanities.  I feel like I'm reading those long-ago stories that my teenaged students so valiantly forced from their pens.<br /><br />The point of view varies, too:  For most of a chapter we are looking through Blomkvist's eyes, and then suddenly, for one paragraph, we have Vanger's point of view...period.  And then we are subjected to summaries of Vanger's long, long family notes that Blomkvist is studying.  Blomkvist asked for this chore, but please don't expect readers to join him.<br /><br />One night Blomkvist visits a female family member, and within a few minutes we have a short, one-paragraph no-love scene which seems forced and included strictly to meet the requirement:  Have some sex.  And Larsson skips around from seemingly unrelated characters over and over again.  Will there ever be a matching of the mismatched?<br /><br />This is beginner formula writing, and if this is the best that modern mystery writers can give us, then let's go back to the real masters.

B001FB55N0|3.0|Okay, so this film isn't original, challenging or anything that would be considered \\"high cinema\\". But it is entertaining and pretty darned funny, which is why I gave it a lukewarm positive review rating.<br /><br />I give it a positive rating with a serious note of caution for Mr. Sandler. Now I'm not an Adam Sandler fan and, in fact, have often avoided his childish and mindless comedies (I point you to the insipidness that is [[ASIN:B00003CXPS Little Nicky]], [[ASIN:B00005JL93 Mr. Deeds]], and, well ...you can look up the rest). However he has surprised me on occasion with a flash of talent in such things as [[ASIN:B0007OCG56 Spanglish]] and [[ASIN:B000QFCCR8 Reign Over Me]]. But, in truth, looking at the trailers and reviews of BEDTIME STORIES, I was more than just a little hesitant to check it out. My big note of caution comes in the form of another early actor who lately has been putting out some of the worst films on celluloid. I'm talking about Eddie Murphy. Murphy's early career reads like the who's-who of great comedies: [[ASIN:B002DMJL9E 48 HOURS]], [[ASIN:B000O59A16 Trading Places]], and the king of them all, [[ASIN:B0019GO55U Beverly Hills Cop]]. These are films that are ingrained in the cinematic community. But look at what he's done lately and you can't help but become a tad nauseous. [[ASIN:B000PC6G92 Norbit]], [[ASIN:B000H6SXYC The Haunted Mansion]], [[ASIN:B00005JM4W Daddy Day Care]] and the abominable The Adventures of Pluto Nash. And that terrible list seems to be growing. Where Murphy apparently has fallen down is in that he's trying hard (and it's obvious he's trying too hard) to be family friendly. Everything he's done lately has been PG or friendlier. I'm not saying that PG films can't be good, it's just that they can stifle the creative process as production companies attempt to appeal to a broader audience. Which brings us back to Bedtime Stories...<br /><br />It's PG. It's good. It's not great. And it nearly slips into the shoddy category, but doesn't for a few reasons that aren't necessarily related to Sandler. The main attraction (for me, at least) was watching the two young kids, Jonathan Morgan Heit and Laura Ann Kesling. It is their infectious and animated actions that made the movie oh-so-watchable. One scene in particular that has stuck with me is when Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling) is in the bathroom and has shaving cream all over her head and says, \\"I\\"m Princess Leia!\\"<br /><br />Whenever Sandler is onscreen with the kids, the interest and impact of the story grows tenfold. And it's not just because that's when the bedtime stories are taking place, but because of the kids' interactions with Sandler and his responsiveness to them. This made it, dare I say, very family friendly and will probably bring a smile to the hardest of hearts.<br /><br />So, yeah, this is a fun film. It won't expand your consciousness or challenge your kids to learn anything new. But it will entertain them and maybe, just maybe, you might like it too.a few reasons that aren't necessarily related to Sandler.

B001EN71DG|5.0|People say that if you already own the previous box set why bother with this one. The answer is simple, if you view it from the point of a person who likes to pretend bad sequel/prequels don't exist then it makes a lot more sense to buy this. This is the set for anyone who wants nothing to do with the special editions that add unnecessary CGI or digitally add Jar Jar and Hayden Christiansin to ruin good movies. Bare bones original, no CGI just puppets and practical effects. Its kinda like drinking coffee black you get the full taste, add to much of anything else and it becomes milk. Bottom line if you don't own or even if you do own the previous set toss it out and buy this one.

B00006H67D|5.0|It's understandable that the wider public prefers to \\"Giant Steps\\" the Coltrane of \\"Blue Trane,\\" \\"My Favorite Things\\" (which established crossover cult status for Coltrane in the '60s), \\"A Love Supreme,\\" the Ballads albums (with and without Johnny Hartman's vocals), perhaps the largely iconic album with the maestro, Duke Ellington, and finally the many dates with Miles, including, of course, \\"Kind of Blue\\").<br /><br />But a musician or close follower of the \\"language\\" of jazz improvisation from Louis through Hawk and Lester to Bird and Diz to Coltrane has got to be most impressed by \\"Giant Steps,\\" especially the title song.  Coltrane simply raised the bar to a completely different level, introducing the major, most seminal, development in the expressive process of jazz improvisation since the complex melodic lines of Bird and Diz.  For an improvising musician to make the changes not in 5ths (ii-V-1), the basis of 99% of popular music (and classical sonata form), but in ascending 3rds, and moreover to improvise meaningfully on this foundation rendered unstable because of the rapid tempo in tandem with the frequency of the unaccustomed chord changes was a feat of Olympian proportions (listen to Tommy Flanagan, one of the very best, struggling during his piano solo).<br /><br />Coltrane was attracted to the popular music of Richard Rodgers, who had an interest in scales and occasionally in harmony similar to Coltrane's.  The bridge to Rodgers and Hart's \\"Have You Met Miss Jones,\\" for example, moves harmonically in a fashion very similar to \\"Giant Steps\\" and \\"Countdown.\\"  And scales are always the basis of Rodgers' melodies (very unlike a \\"motivic\\" composer such as Gershwin).  Not just in \\"Do-Re-Mi\\" and \\"My Favorite Things\\" but tunes like \\"My Romance,\\" \\"Spring Is Here\\" and \\"My Funny Valentine\\" Rodgers simply dazzles with the immortal melodies that can come from mere scales.<br /><br />Another album by Coltrane that deserves every musician's close attention is \\"Live at Birdland.\\"  The unaccompanied cadenza that Coltrane plays at the end of \\"I Want to Talk About You\\" (composed and performed by Billy Eckstine in the '40s) simply has to be heard to be believed.  (Compare it to Louis' \\"West End Blues\\" or his unaccompanied solo on \\"Laughin' Louis\\" or to Hawk's \\"Body and Soul\\" or to Bird's 4-bar break on \\"Night in Tunisia\\" (the Carnegie Hall concert version).  But as far as a second \\"indispensable\\" album, for different reasons, I would have to pick, out of the thousands of jazz albums I've listened to, Bill Evans at the Village Vanguard, which is not to say that either session is not without its imperfections.  (During Bill's session, the electricity went out, stopping the tape recorder while the music continued.  And had Coltrane learned the lyrics to Cole Porter's \\"Every Time We Say Goodbye,\\" it's unlikely he would have lost the melody each time around on the last 8 bars.  Tommy Flanagan was hardly about to correct him after the humbling experience of struggling through Coltrane's unprecedented title song.)<br /><br />Because of the singular importance of this album, the current edition, with the \\"out-takes,\\" is the one to own (even as an additional album to your current collection of \\"Giant Steps\\" editions).panied cadenza that Coltrane plays at the end of \\"I Want to Talk About You\\" (composed and performed by Billy Eckstine in the '40s) simply has to be heard to be believed.

031236198X|1.0|This is a children's book, and I read it in thirty minutes. The \\"lessons\\" are so simple that you won't need any extra time digesting them. The funny thing is, this book is aimed at adults, and not just any adults, but the kind of adults who want to be leaders or agents of change. Ha!<br /><br />Yes, it's a problem solving fable, but not ordinary problems: Catastrophic, life-threatening problems. I suppose that you could modify the eight steps to solve ordinary problems, but even then it's too elementary to be useful.<br /><br />Step number one is to create a sense of urgency in other people. In this fable, one penguin had to convince the other penguins that their home was doomed to destruction and many of them, especially the old and the young, would die if they didn't heed his warnings and take drastic action immediately. You see, these penguins had been living on an iceberg for many generations; indeed, it was the only homeland that any of them had ever known or heard about. But one curious penguin had discovered evidence that their iceberg was cracking and melting. The evidence was on the underside of the iceberg, easy enough to see if any penguin cared to look. The curious penguin was convinced that their home would break into little pieces within a couple of months, right in the middle of the dark and stormy winter season. Once the first step is accomplished (i.e. everyone is now convinced of doom and feeling panic), the next seven steps follow simple logic, such as building teamwork, coming up with possible solutions, etc. Yes, as with any decent children's story, this one has a happy ending. The penguins solve their problem by becoming nomads, moving from one healthy iceberg to the next.<br /><br />Well, what can we take from this fable, then? If the iceberg is a metaphor for the Earth, shall the human race consider becoming galactic nomads and move from one good planet to another? These penguins didn't have to fix anything, or learn how to get along with each other, or learn how to share and use resources, or how to create a sustainable existence. All they had to do was move to another place (which, by the way, is precisely what the Europeans did when they came to the \\"New World\\"). And there was an endless supply of great places to move to, without the conflict of moving to a place that was already occupied by other penguins. Wouldn't it be wonderful if the human race could just pack up and, after a day or two of travel, arrive on another unspoiled Earth that had no other humans?<br /><br />And how does this fable work for more ordinary problems? Let's say that you, a junior employee, think your company is going in the wrong direction. Okay, so you are first supposed to create a sense of urgency within your company: You try to convince fellow key employees that the company will fail under its present leadership. I can just hear The Donald yelling, \\"You're Fired!\\"<br /><br />But really, how can this story help with the serious problems we are facing today? Did the Bush administration read this book, and did they tell us about WMD in Iraq in order to create a sense of urgency, so we could \\"solve\\" the problem of terrorism? Or, did Al Gore read this book, and is he right about the catastrophic consequences of man-made climate change? Ah, but if only the evidence was as clear, and the solution as easy, as in this fable! That is where this fable fails to deliver: Defining complex problems is tremendously more difficult than this fable implies, and creating and implementing solutions is more difficult still. OF COURSE we have to define the problem, find solutions, and have good leadership and teamwork to implement it! But in the real world, it's easier said than done, and this fable doesn't help at all with how to do it. In fact, I think that this fable hurts more than it helps, encouraging people, whatever their beliefs, to try to create a sense of urgency in other people, and to take quick, drastic action. That kind of thinking can get us involved in unnecessary wars and using \\"enhanced interrogation techniques.\\" It can even create suicide bombers. Think about it.<br /><br />Bottom line: I think that a 5-year-old kid, and an adult, would learn more about business, leadership, and group dynamics from Sesame Street.<br /><br />P.S. This book has now been out for 4 years and is still available only in the more expensive hardback edition. I'd like to convince the author of the URGENT! need to publish a less expensive paperback edition, because young kids don't have so much money to spend on books.

B002ZG997C|3.0|I just saw this one in the theater.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I wasn't overly impressed.  Denzel Washington was great, as always, and so was Gary Olman, but the story line was a wee bit slow at times and kind of lacking a punch.  It was a little gory, too (at least for me, anyway--not really my kind of movie).<br /><br />The story begins with fallen ash and dead bodies everywhere.  There has been a massive war that has left many dead and the land stripped.  It has become survival of the fittest for the most part.  Gangs are worse than wild animals and often ambush folks and take whatever they can to survive. Water and food are hard to find.  Some people even resort to eating human meat, and they are the ones with shaky hands.  The basic scene is very similar to Mel Gibson's \\"Mad Max\\" movie from the 1970s (?).<br /><br />Denzel (Eli) is our hero.  He walks the land in peace, trying to survive, but he can also defend himself when others try to mess with him.  He is unbelievably quick with a knife, gun, or arrow and when he must kill, he prays over the bodies.  He carries a book with him and is on a mission from God to take the book to the West Coast.  The book is the King James Bible.  After the war, all other remaining copies of the book were destroyed.<br /><br />Gary Olman is a power hungry bad guy who is searching for the same book, because it is said to give power to its owner and he wants to create a kingdom for himself out of what's left.  Gary gets a bit overly enthusiastic when he finds out that Eli has that book and the struggle begins.<br /><br />As I said, it's good but not great, although both actors do an excellent job in their roles.  Would I watch it again?  No!

B002QGUFWE|4.0|i wasent exactly a  lady gaga fan at first when i first found  out about  her, but  after i heard  a  couple  of  her more popular, radio friendly songs, i started liking her a  bit  more, so i finally  decided to buy  this particular cd, and  i must say, i like  it  alot... i would  prefer if  it  wasent edited, but i dont  care  that much... im really  into the  first disc in this  two disc set, the  fame  monster, and  im really  pleased i got  both albums  in one, instead of buying the actual fame  monster cd, which at just eight songs, i consider an ep album, so i feel with this particular cd, im getting my  moneys worth, and  more.... i think lady gaga is  a  very  talented, and  eccentric singer, and  preformer, with her own signature style, flair, and  grace, and  it  is  refreshing  to see someone  like  this  with such diversity, and  virsility than all this  manufactured crap these days... its  nice  to see someone  who actually  writes their  own songs for  once, instead of  leaving  it  to the  producers hands....  the  songs  that i like  the  most off of  the  fame  monster disc are: alejandro, dance  in the  dark, so happy  i could die, and  of  course bad  romance... i havent  really  listened to the  seccond  dic  the  fame  all the  way through yet, but  love  paparazzi the  most out  of  all the  songs  i have  heard  so far... im glad  i finally  gave  her a chance, and  am slowly  letting  her grow  on me... i know  she  is  not  for  everyone, but  i do in fact appreiate  her individuality.... her fashion sense is  a  bit  questionable at times, but  i still like  her, so i will just leave  it  it  that for  now... all in all, i like  this  album, and  do not  regret purchasing it, and  look forward  to her other material in the  not  so distant  future.....
B002OSAT7U|5.0|amazing. If you like deadmau5 buy this! Not as good as random album title but only cuz that album has such a huge spot in heart. Real close tho that's why it get's 5 stars! Cus it's growing on me more and more every day! Overall amazing. Deadmau5 is the coolest canadian around!
B0001Z37HM|2.0|The only way this movie could be worse is if Arnold wasn't in it. A real dud. Brigitte Nielsen is nice to look at but she can't carry this movie on looks alone. A waste of Arnold's time. If you're looking for a third \\"Conan\\" movie this isn't it.
0307716988|5.0|Michael Jackson's autobiography, Moonwalk, is so worth reading. I not only got to know his life experiences that ordered his steps and drove him to becoming such a great singer, music writer, dancer..., but to understand how his unusual upbringing, starting at so young an age, made him see life and others idealistically. He was obsessed with creating what he believed would make people happy and \\"the world a better place.\\" His child-like trust and innocence was obvious in many of his choices. I can see how these characteristics in him were later to be used by some to take advantage of him and how he could be misjudged. Overall, Moonwalk showed me that Michael was a gentle, kind, and gifted man, and that he was a super success because he put his heart and soul into what we all remember him best for, his beautiful voice, music and dance. Michael's book, Moonwalk, like Michael himself, is a gift given to us all.

The man is amazing on stage, and his message in person is even more transformational than in print. I give Linchpin the book five stars, but the Linchpin keynote deserves six!     Thanks, Seth, for the fun and life-changing ride. I especially liked your collection of cafeteria worker photos!

B00110K62U|4.0|This was amazing.  It is the next best thing to watching the show live.  Highly recommend it.
B000BPFBVW|5.0|I can't overstate how incredible this disc sounds. The separation of the instruments on the various surround speakers if flawless.  I could listen to this album every day.  The immersive surround experience really makes you feel like you are on stage.  I never really thought I would be able to hear the difference between high-res audio and normal cd-quality audio but I most certainly can with this disc.  Any foreign artifacts in the signal are literally undetectable.  The clarity is outstanding.  For anyone who appreciates music, this item is a must-have for your collection.  And the great thing is, you don't need a special player to make it work!<br /><br />P.S.  I bought this for MUCH cheaper on the actual Monster website

B000MG1ZFQ|1.0|BUYER BEWARE!  This 2007 version is REMIXED. In fact all 6 DOOR albums have been remixed. It does not clearly indicate this in on the Amazon netsite. Being a Doors fan from way back I know all their songs very well. This MIX is different. As stated in the liner notes of the CD, PARTS HAVE BEEN ADDED. Ray Manzarek says piano, guitar and backing vocals were found on the original tapes and added to this new mix. I don't really like the added material. It was probably left out for a good reason. More is not better. In this case I find it distracting. Wishfull Sinfull and Soft Parade  are not better in my opinion. Soft Parade does not have Jim's \\"what did he say\\" after the \\"I really like this part....\\" Some songs have the instrumentation clearer and more up front than the vocals. The only thing gained is a new part in front of Soft Parade.   The overall sound is much better but it is not the classic mix and Jim was not here to approve or disapprove. If I had known this I would not of bought this version. I wanted to replace my original vinyl copy and this will not do. Even worse, the original REMASTER from 1990 has been discontinued!  I THINK AMAZON NEEDS TO CLEARLY INDICATE REMIXED IN THE PRODUCT DETAILS. There is no mention of this fact. (or I don't see one!)
0451209338|5.0|This is the second Daniel Silva book I have read and I enjoyed it immensely!!  He is quickly becoming a favorite author of mine.  His plots are tight and his characters gripping and real.  The action and story keep you going and 'on edge' until the last page.  Then you are happily satisfied (with the story) but sad that it's over and you will probably look for another Silva book soon!!!!
B002ZG98J6|4.0|**If you have not read the books, this review DOES contain possible spoilers. If you have read them, then nothing here will be a surprise... hopefully.**<br /><br />As an avid Percy Jackson fan, I knew that I had to go and see any movie based off Rick Riordan's tremendous book series. And when I heard wind that THE LIGHTNING THIEF was indeed coming out to theaters on January 12th, I made sure to take work off and be ready to see the midnight showing. Now that I'm fresh off the movie, I thought I would sit down and share my thoughts on the movie directed by Harry Potter's own Chris Columbus.<br /><br />First off -- this is one of your basic book-to-movie adaptations. That said, some things HAVE to be cut for sake of time. I wouldn't mind watching five hours of one of my favorite books being turned into a movie, but I realize that most people can't sit still that long -- let alone the whole bathroom // eating situation. Unfortunately, a LOT of plot is cut from Riordan's first book in the series, leaving something that is still rich in and of itself, but is not quite as complex as the book. There are also a lot of subtle changes that will probably irk book purists: such as Annabeth's hair being brown instead of blonde, Annabeth's blue eyes vs. gray eyes, and Grover being African-American (which I LOVED). Set that aside, there are also a couple of major plot points that are skewed in order to fit the two hour time slot.<br /><br />One thing I will note is the fact that a couple of the early action scenes didn't seem as \\"dangerous\\" to me. I didn't feel like the characters were in as much danger as they were supposed to be. It seemed like pretty quick fixes altogether at the beginning, and I would have loved to see those battles drawn out just a bit.<br /><br />**MOVIE SPOILER**<br /><br />As a double warning, this section contains spoilers on the major plot of the movie. The main thing I missed from the book plot was the over-arching plot introduced in the series about the big prophecy and the children of the big three gods: Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. This plot was completely thrown out the window (for now anyway), and also Kronos is not barely even mentioned. The actual thief of the master bolt is changed, which didn't bother me as much, but definitely changed the dynamic of the storyline. To be honest, I wouldn't have minded if Columbus had just added on another 30 minutes to the movie and given us this storyline. I would have loved to watch more.<br /><br />**END MOVIE SPOILER**<br /><br />Okay -- my nit-picking aside, there were quite a few GOOD things to love about this movie. For instance, Uma Thurman's appearance as Medusa was inspired and insanely creepy, and definitely it goes down as one of my favorite sequences. The whole set-up of her Garden Emporium was downright freaky and definitely made me jump. The other great thing was actually the look of Camp Half-Blood. It is changed a bit from the books, but the realistic direction they tilted was perfect. Capture the flag was great, as well as a scene in the Nashville parthenon (which is quite changed from the book). Also, the manner in which they have to travel across the USA was a perfect plot improvement that changed encounters with monsters from random chance occurences and giving them a reason to have to face such horrible things.<br /><br />Acting-wise, there were only a couple clunker lines that kind of fell flat, but overall the cast did a fairly manageable job of their roles, with a few shining moments (such as Uma Thurman) thrown into the mix. Logan Lerman does a decent job portraying Percy, albeit a bit older than he is in the books, but that didn't bother me too much. To be perfectly honest, I don't quite know why they chose to change Annabeth so much at least in looks, but it ended up working out okay.<br /><br />THE LIGHTNING THIEF is definitely a good movie for families to enjoy, but do be aware for really little kids there are a couple pretty frightening scenes. My main advice is this: Forget the story you love in the book and go see the movie as a separate story altogether that uses characters and events from the books. Overall, with the time constraints that they had, the movie crew did a fairly good job of boiling down Riordan's book as best they could.<br /><br />Here's crossing my fingers for THE SEA OF MONSTERS...see the movie as a separate story altogether that uses characters and events from the books. Overall, with the time constraints that they had, the movie crew did a fairly good job of boiling down Riordan's book as best they could.    Here's crossing my fingers for THE SEA OF MONSTERS...
B000DZIGE4|4.0|Jarhead the self-imposed moniker of the Marines follows \\"Swoff,\\" a third-generation enlistee, from a sobering stint in boot camp to active duty, sporting a sniper's rifle and a hundred-pound ruck on his back through Middle East deserts with no cover from intolerable heat or from Iraqi soldiers, always potentially just over the next horizon. Swoff and his fellow Marines sustain themselves with sardonic humanity and wicked comedy on blazing desert fields in a country they don't understand against an enemy they can't see for a cause they don't fully fathom. Sergeant Sykes is a Marine lifer who heads up Swofford's scout/sniper platoon, while Troy is Swoff's friend and mentor, a die-hard member of STA, their elite Marine Unit. Thhis movie has striking cinematography. Scenes in the desert, especially with the oil fires, are great. The shots are done perfectly and originally throughout while the score and soundtrack takes it to a powerful emotional level. \\"JARHEAD\\" is a viscerally unforgiving, psychologically heartbreaking movie.
B001EN71DQ|4.0|The dvds were in excelent condition and shipping was fast. BUT I didn't   know that certains dvds cannot be seen in other regions.

B00009APK1|5.0|Sauron's forces increase. His allies grow. The Ringwraiths return in an even more frightening form. Saruman's army of Uruk Hai is ready to launch an assault against Aragorn and the people of Rohan. Yet, the Fellowship is broken and Boromir is dead. For the little hope that is left, Frodo and Sam march on into Mordor, unprotected. A number of new allies join with Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Pippin and Merry. And they must defend Rohan and attack Isengard. Yet, while all this is going on, Sauron's troops mass toward the City of Gondor, for the War of the Ring is about to begin. The battle sequence alone represents successful movie making in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand movie making which is as entertaining and enjoyable as  a movie can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.
B001RTSPVY|4.0|\\"Breaking Bad\\" is a hell of a show. It follows the story of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher in New Mexico with terminal lung cancer who decides to use his chemistry prowess to enter the world of crystal meth in an attempt to make as much money for his family as he can before he dies. Sound insane? You bet. But somehow it works.    The second season of a television show is often thought to be the one that makes it or breaks it. In the case of \\"Breaking Bad,\\" its short first season was excellent, and suggested promise for its outlandish premise, but the second season would be the test of whether the show could really sustain itself. And it passed that test with flying colors.    The second season exceeds the first in every way. The stakes are higher, the premises crazier, and the danger greater than ever. The series still hinges upon Bryan Cranston's pitch-perfect performance as Walter, a wonderfully complex tragic hero whose downfall seems inevitable but for whom you can't help but root nevertheless. Season two finds Walter getting deeper and deeper into the dark world of drugs, and the show takes several dark turns as Walter does things we never imagined him capable of.     This show is one of the best and most innovative ones on television, and hopefully it will continue for some time to come (although, as is always the case with television shows, may it end on a good note before it goes stale). Season three is set to start next month, and it would be a mistake to miss it -- but it would also be a mistake to watch it without having seen the first two seasons, so if you haven't yet entered the dark and whacky world of \\"Breaking Bad,\\" what are you waiting for? You're in for a hell of a ride.
B00006CXSS|5.0|One of the best WWII series or war movies in general, if youve never seen it before take a chance if your into these types of movies, you wont be let down
B00337KM2S|3.0|\\"Up in the Air\\" had all the ingredients to be a great film: accomplished director and writer, talented actors, a clever and timely topic. And yet something feels amiss in this film, as though it came so close to the mark but just didn't quite make it.    George Clooney is Ryan Bingham, a man whose job entails flying about the country laying off employees because their bosses don't want to do the dirty work themselves. Ryan is a man who is detached from everyone in his life, and is convinced that he doesn't have a need for human connection and interaction. Throughout the film, two things happen: first, he is forced to take on a young trainee (Natalie Keener, played by Anna Kendrick) and show her his business, and second, he meets Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) a fellow professional traveler with whom he begins a relationship. The film follows these characters as they connect and disconnect and try to make sense of one another.    The characters are compelling, and at times the film is poignant, but overall the whole is not greater than its parts. Perhaps part of the problem was the feeling that two stories were being told: the first act of the film focuses on Natalie and her travels with Ryan, and then Natalie disappears for much of the second act, which centers around Ryan and Alex. Both stories are compelling, but they don't fit together very well, and as a result neither feels like it received proper treatment. This is not to say that films must end well-resolved and clear-cut; this is not the case. Nevertheless the characters in the film should undergo some sort of arc, and I'm forced to question whether the characters here were given enough time to have an arc, or if their stories were cut short but trying to fit too much into one film. The story for the most part is engaging, though it is often predictable and occasionally tedious, and I wonder if it couldn't have been a more nuanced film.    This is not to say \\"Up in the Air\\" is a bad film -- it is not by any means. It is fun (albeit depressing) and Clooney and Farmiga are both excellent in their roles. Director Jason Reitman is an accomplished filmmaker, though next to his past efforts, \\"Juno\\" and \\"Thank You For Smoking,\\" \\"Up in the Air\\" is his weakest film.    Perhaps my expectations were set too high by all of the acclaim and hype the movie received, but it is my belief that this film had the potential to be far greater than it was. It is certainly worth a watch, but something about it doesn't quite add up.
0375413405|5.0|I moved from Europe to the USA 3 years ago. I never heard of Julia Child, to the astonishment of lots of Americans I spoke to. I love to cook and bake from the comfort of my own house. In Europe I was a manager of a bakery/pastrie store, the kind you won't find here in America. What my employers there (the bakers themselves) taught me was never to fall for substitutes for, especially, butter and sugar. Going through Mastering the art of French Cooking, I was utterly pleased to see that Ms. Child stuck to that principle as well. I've made quite a few recipes from this amazing book. The notorious cheese soufflé is a true classic gem, and turned out to be perfect (it's really a matter of READING carefully). Like all the other recipes, I love the fact that she lists the ingredients that come with each step in the process of making the recipe. Very clear, no nonsense and in my opinion not complicated at all. I have made onion soup for years according to my own recipe and therefore I was very curious how Ms. Child's version would be like. It was more work for sure, she cooks the onions in butter and oil and for quite a long time. She also adds white wine, which I never did before. The soup was outstanding, only next time I will add the bay leaf I myself always use, I missed that subtle touch, however I'm planning to stick with her version of this tasty soup.  I do not always agree with Ms. Child, for example she almost only uses Swiss or Parmesan cheese in her cheese recipes, I find a nice matured Gouda a fantastic cheese to use as well. Like in the soufflé.  In her baking recipes that involves apples she mentiones Golden Delicious mostly. I find that these apples lose their flavour completely, probably because they miss the tartness I prefer. So I use Granny Smith instead.     But overall this book is must have! It's fantastic. Everything that involves cooking/baking is discussed. Tools, measurements, ingredients availability, although that might have changed over theyears. I'm lucky to have a Wegmans close to me where, so far, I've been able to find everything I need.  Oh...I've read in some reviews that one needs so many tools sometimes to make a dish, I find that that gives me a sense of 'real cooking'.  Tonight I'm making Bouillabaisse for the first time. I'm already excited about making it.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|\\"Moon\\" is that refreshing but rare treat -- a solidly entertaining science fiction film that doesn't fall into the traps of corny special effects and cardboard acting so unfortunately associated with the genre. The film breaks down the genre with a simple, character-driven story that could almost be executed as a play; the cast of characters and number of sets are at an absolute minimum. This should not discourage you from seeing it; to the contrary, \\"Moon\\" is a taut, tense thriller that grows in intensity as the film progresses and builds to a fever pitch.    The plot revolves around Sam Bell, a man whose long shift of duty at a lunar base is coming to an end. And then something strange happens. Do yourself a favor and read nothing else about the film before seeing it; to summarize the plot any further than I have is to do the film a disservice. Give yourself to this film and enjoy the ride; the twists and turns it takes are absolutely worth it. Everything about this film is spot-on. Sam Rockwell's acting is impeccable, the direction is tight and sharp, and Clint Mansell's score brings a haunting atmosphere to this dark and compelling film.     Science fiction is not a particularly successful or popular genre, and sometimes it is easy to understand why. Too often science fiction films focus on the special effects and the technology and the aliens, and not on telling good stories about real people. How refreshing to see a film like \\"Moon\\" that employs the use of such great talent to a genre that, quite frankly, could use the help. Whether you're a die-hard sci-fi fan or a skeptic to the genre, give \\"Moon\\" a go. It just might restore your faith.
6305128952|4.0|I had the VHS version of this video but the tape became corrupted due to use, so I purchased the DVD version.  Both my wife and I liked the story and the pace at which it developed the relationships between the characters.  I especially liked the maturity depicted by the children raised on the ranch and Robert Redford's ranch family.  The story is about an injured horse and young rider with the efforts to restore both to wholeness.  Of course, there is a romantic element in that the mother of the injured child, who is married, and Redford develop a desire for each other.     The performance by Redford is classic.    My only complaint with the ordered DVD was that it did not mention it was Widescreen only, as did other DVDs in the list, so I had hoped it was both Widescreen and Full Screen, as I have a very old TV.

0545091020|4.0|This is a really far fetched story but very well done.  My sister wanted me to read it because she has students in middle school who have read it.  I would be interested in hearing reviews from that age group. I really like \\"the reader.\\"  She has a good voice that easy to listen to.
159562015X|4.0|I found this book inspiring. The book encourages us to exploit our strength and be realistic rather than try to do things that we never know before. The book gave example about Michael Jordan that he knew that his strength was in playing basketball, so he exploited the strength. He wouldn't have been that successful if he tried to be an accountant for example. Must read...

0061922315|5.0|Gowda has written a powerful, entertaining, and enlightening book.  The story of a daughter born into poverty in Mumbai, given up for adoption, and raised in the US will surely hold the reader's interest.   Her literary skill and knowledge of India takes the reader to India in such a way that one actually feels they are there in slums and poor villages.           One of the aspects of this book that I found refreshing was that although there were marital problems in both families no one resorted to having extramarital affairs.  Both marriages endured the hardships and problems of life.      It has been a long time since I have read a book that I found so compelling.  I had difficulty putting in down and finished it in two days.  I definitely will recommend this book to friends.  Great first novel!
B0030BOCEG|5.0|This CD has become an instant masterpiece.  It takes something that we have not seen in HIM for a while.  It brings out poppy rock and just extreme happiness.  You can not help but just be incredibly happy while listening to this god of an album.  It is inspiring and just a must have not only for HIM fans, but for anyone into this type of music.  Highly recommended and would suggest getting the bonus disc because it is the whole album in acoustic.  If you are familiar with other acoustics, then you know that they are a must have.  Great altogether and hard to decide whether the acoustic or normal album is better.  GET THIS NOW!!!!

0764207407|5.0|Dear Jane Austen Fans,<br /><br />We all know the story of Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen. The Dashwood children loose their father and the prominent estate goes to the half-older brother, John. The sisters must move on to a lower standard of living together, a new little cottage. While living in Barton Cottage, the girls search to find love. This very beloved story is a true classic.<br /><br />Excitingly, a new version of the book has just been released. This edition has everything a true fan could want in this book. There are several side notes throughout the book with very insightful trivia. Who knew that \\"furniture from this time period was far from comfortable since springs weren't used until 1828 (p. 119)?\\" Or that the \\"average life expectancy was only 40, but if you made it past 20 and were wealthy, you could hope to live nearly as long as we do today (p.41).\\"<br /><br />At the end of the story, the reader will find a list of 12 questions for conversation. Although I wish it had questions instead at the end of each chapter, this book with it's side-notes and extras still make it a great addition to any fan's library. It would be great to use in a book club as well.<br /><br />So my advice to you is to get this copy to add to your memorabilia wall of Austen books today! You'll be glad you did!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Number One Austen Fan<br /><br />**** I received a copy of this book from Bethany House for free to review.

B00275EGWY|4.0|I've served in Iraq several times.  I give this movie an extra star for LOOKING like Iraq--up to this point, I have yet to see a film that captured what Baghdad or other large urban areas in Iraq look like.  From personal experience, Iraq, Qatar, Afghanistan, and Kuwait, and places within those countries, all look different from each other and this film actually got it pretty-close-to-right in this way.      Decent plotline, though it meandered at times.  Decent direction, decent camera work, decent special effects.  Some things coulda been better regarding the production but overall, a pretty well-made action film commenting on the combination of stress and enjoyment (yes, enjoyment) which many men get while performing their duties in war.  Jeremy Renner and Brian Geraghty are pretty solid.    If you are in the military and have Iraq experience, be advised there are a number of errors, from the outfitting of HUMVEEs to PPE to uniform wear to the blatant GO violations which are almost rampant.  Units seemingly moving willy-nilly on the battlefield without support or apparently even in radio contact with anyone.  A war crime which simply occurs and no one comments on.  Incorrect terminology is used, astoundingly poor (and illegal) decisions made by \\"veteran\\" characters at times.  Perhaps Katherine Bigalow would have been well-served by hiring a senior NCO or officer to \\"edit\\" her script.  It supposedly takes place in 2004 but many things look like 2007, then March 2003, then 2006, it's sorta all over the place in \\"historical consistency.\\"  You just have to look beyond it and acknowledge, like we all have to do when watching movies, certain liberties are taken by directors to make their movies work.    Nonetheless, a decent action flick.
0786868724|5.0|What a terrific read! Very engaging story, great character connection and what a wealth of information! Makes one think on their religious perceptions and beliefs. Highly recommend giving this book a read!
0142407542|5.0|For some reason, I did not have high expectations for this book. Perhaps because the original is such a favorite with my kids and it was done so well. The sequel always seems to let you down, right? Well, not in this case. It's every bit as much fun, and my kids seem to love having it read to them just as well. You may end up having to double storytime, though, in order to read both books. Not the end of the world. If you have the first book, you have to get this one. If you have neither - get both! The pair would also make a great gift for a little kid's birthday.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|even though it's only be out a few days I feel like I'm wearing grooves in the CD from constantly play. It definately was worth the 10 year wait. Gorgeously produced, with nice little R & B and gospel touches. It has her trademark sound but has a different feel than her other albums. Sade's voice is as rich and soulful as ever. A must for sade fans.
0385341008|4.0|I'm happy to have read this story. The residents' tales of wartime in the village, told in letters, were compelling. I was enjoying the more light-hearted present-day (right after the end of the war, that is) story as well, until I felt jarred by the ending. Even though I realize Ms. Barrows had to finish the story alone, I wish she had given more time to the ending so I could have believed in it.<br /><br />By the way, this is the first book I've read on my Kindle!
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book, let alone the whole series, was a amazing. As a harry potter addict I did not see many similarities in it as other reviewers had. Though there were few. I'm not here to compare the two. Out of the entire series from start to finish, minus the Demigod Files - which I have yet to read, I slowly grew attached to these characters. Percy, Annabeth, Grover, all of them really, even Luke, Towards the end I couldn't believe I was going to be finishing the books, and I was sad to see it end completely. After reading the other books and coming along to the last I thought it was amazing, everything I had expected for the book. I can't wait until he comes out with the new series and I will definitely be one of the first to buy and read this books. The way Riordan wrote the book, it made me feel like I was there just walking as another one of their group members. Definitely worth the read.
B000002JR8|5.0|This is the best Pantera album IMO.  Gotta love the variation of songs here.  Top shelf classic CD, Pantera just rules the planet.  It is not possible to listen to this CD and not get pumped up.  Not possible.<br /><br />Parental Warning:  Side effects include broken necks and smashing of innocent bystanders jaws for no good reason!

B0000E6XH3|5.0|First, to be honest, other than in the generic references of the pop-culture landscape, was I vaguely aware of House sensation \\"Daft Punk\\". Unknowingly exposed to their infectious electronic dance beat rhythms from tracks such as \\"One More Time\\" or \\"Harder Better Faster Stronger\\" by the commercial concepts of shrewd marketing firms using their material to push more things we don't need into the public conscious. Thus was I uninitiated to the scope of Daft Punk's material and the source album for this musical, the 2001 album \\"Discovery\\" (I wonder if the name and release year were an intentional homage to Kubrick's \\"2001 A Space Odyssey\\" which included the space craft \\"Discovery\\" famously hijacked by the HAL-9000 computer?).    It is that in being quite a fan of Anime and Japanese Animation and culture, and importantly, a fan of the animated works created or influenced by the inestimable imagination of Leji Matsumoto was my access point to this particular work. Matsumoto is very well known for his unique \\"retro\\" style character designs, his penchant for Science Fiction, and stories which capture the human condition with a kind of introspective discovery by the characters he creates.    However in this case Daft Punk's House Electronica with an apparently retro style from the source album fuses exceptionally well with Matsumoto's visual design.    What is most impressive is that the movie appears to be a derivative work, that is the album was created first and Daft Punk then approached Matsumoto et.al. to create the movie afterward. The music and movie concepts are fused so well that I would have thought that the music was created for the movie. It was almost as if Matsumoto was able to extract what was in the heads of Daft Punk when they created the album and expressed it visually. Indeed the appropriately corporate sounding pop name for the alien band on earth - the \\"CrescenDolls\\" I find hard to believe was actually the name of the track on the album as \\"Crescendolls\\" without that particular usage in mind! Or the track \\"Veridis Quo\\" and the way they were able to meld the ambiance of the Darkwood character in the movie and the corresponding movie sequence to this uniquely yet appropriately sounding track.    I am also an Audiophile, and I enjoy a wide variety of music, and am able to enjoy electronic music genres such as House. And as mentioned I am an Anime fan so it is easy to enjoy this movie. However unless you just cannot stand Japanese animation or House electronica, then this \\"Animated Musical\\" is just about appropriate for anyone, especially Daft Punk or Matsumoto fans.    Also if you are fans of Matsumoto you will easily recognize some of the character designs that recur commonly in Matsumoto's works. Such as Stella, the female alien band member, she is the requisite willowy retro-styled blonde. Shep, the pilot of the \\"guitar space cruiser\\" is reminiscent of the Harlock character. I am also quite sure I saw Captain Avatar of the Argo from Star Blazers in a crowd enjoying the Earth Version of the band as the CrescenDolls. And the blue skinned aliens will remind Star Blazers fans of the Gamilons, though these aliens are notably less hostile!    The DVD menu and interactive design is an art form itself, and its extras are not designed with the easiest usage in mind, but that can be forgiven. It is analogous to a \\"fan shrine\\" web site, rather than a corporate marketing web site in theme and usage.     The Audio on the DVD is well done. It is mixed for standard 2-ch stereo as well as 5.1 (dolby?) and DTS 5.1. Inserting the DVD prompts you to choose the English or French version, I used English.     I upconverted the DVD to 1080i using my Oppo BDP-83 Blu-Ray player, to my 50\\" 1080i Plasma, in DTS mode direct 8-ch analog audio output to a Sunfire TGP-5 and a 5.1 speaker system consistent of Klipsch Icon Wood speakers. The sound quality was impressive, and the video, being native 480p had a high average bit rate of around 7.8 -8.1 kb/s, and looked great even upconverted (with the lack of a Blu-Ray release this must suffice). The vibrant colors and powerful dance beats were a potent and dazzling combination to behold on a large hi-def monitor and on a high-resolution audio rig.    You could put this movie on at a party and satisfy gregarious dance types as well as the more introverted who may choose to chill on the couch, and keep the party moving just the same. Or one could just crank it up and zone out on the stunning visuals and throbbing music.    Overall an awesome product at an awesome price! If you like Anime or you like Daft Punk you should own this already.

1423113497|5.0|I bought these books for my 4th grader and my high schooler and college age child wanted them too! After some squabbling over who got to read them first, they all read them together. These books are awesome! Even Harry Potter didn't get the attention of all my kids at the same time!    When I asked my kids why, they told me the books were \\"Extremely interesting\\", \\"Fun to read\\", \\"I'm hooked\\", \\"You can't read just one page.\\", \\"Exciting\\"    THis set would also make a great gift for any age child - or adult!
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I just recieved my set on april 6th 2010 and I must say it was everything I hoped it would be.     The problems I had with the previous set were:  1. I did not like the 4 large square holes on all 4 corners,  i didnt like the idea that they were dust collectors.   and 2.  I felt I needed to be very cautious taking them out of the paper sleeves so as not to cause scratches.  THIS SET IS GREAT.  EVERY SEASON HAS ITS OWN CASE AND INSIDE OF EACH THERE ARE INDIVIDUAL DVD/CD LIKE SECURE PRESS PLASTIC SPACES FOR EACH DVD.    I also fits on the shelf perfect. an it has all  B S G  mini movies  and even includes \\"THE PLAN\\" which I didnt care for ,  but it is nice to have it included.  AND TO ALL YOU IDIOTS WHO THINK IT SHOULD HAVE HAD SOMETHING FROM  \\" CAPRICA\\" GET YOUR HEAD ON STRAIGHT AND REALISE THAT IT WAS A  D I F F E R E N T   SERIES.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Her voice is absolutely awesome.  She has the flawless voice of an angel.  The first song \\"Wild Horses\\" is so hauntingly beautiful and sad, I play it over and over, and of course \\"I dreamed a Dream\\" is exquisite.   There is a nice versatility in the CD.  Not one disappointment.   This will be something I will buy several of for birthday and xmas gifts to people that don't have her.  As always, Amazon's shipping was immediate.   One of my all time favorites.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I was very very skeptical when I first heard that Masterpiece theater was doing another adaptation of a Jane Austen novel, masterpiece is very hit or miss when it comes to adaptations. But this movie was GOOD! Actually, it really was a miniseries cut into 4 parts. If you have seen the most recent adaptations with Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam than you have to prepare for a different feel to this re-telling. It follows the book quite closely but it does take a few liberties. You can tell that they were going for a more realistic feel to this adaptation. Not every hair was always in place and not all of Emma's dresses were ball gowns. What I liked about this version of Emma was that they made Emma herself more realistic to her age and situation. She is young, only about 20 or 21 and has grown up loved but very spoiled. Also, her manner is consistent with how she would have grown up! Although born into wealth, she grew up around townspeople who were not of the same status. Although she knows her status and her manners reflect it, she is sheltered and used to her surroundings. This version was very realistic.   Two thumbs up! It's certainly worth watching and not to mention the two leads (Garai and Miller as Emma and Mr.Knightley) were especially convincing in their roles and had amazing chemistry with each other!

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Like many of you, I fell in love with the Planet Earth series from the very first episode. The one-of-a-kind visuals is what really makes this series so amazing. Although, I became accustomed to and enjoyed Sigourney Weaver's narration I ended up buying the BBC Series version because the blu-ray is of superior quality. I researched this far and wide before I made my final purchase because I really wanted the Sigourney Weaver narration. However, I'm happy that I ended up buying the bbc series version because the picture quality is impeccable and the narrator (David Attenborough) is not half bad either. If you're trying to decide which version to buy, I'd recommend this one because picture quality is the entire reason you'd want Planet Earth on Blu-Ray in the first place.
0684824906|5.0|A pantheon such as Abraham Lincoln and his presidential term(s) have been scrutinized and considered in uncountable written and spoken works. The trick then for any author wishing to undertake a new study is to find a fresh angle or (at best) unearth previously undiscovered and revelatory documents. Doris Kearns Goodwin chooses the former as she expertly exposes the Lincoln presidency as one which had a politically savvy, but initially overly antagonistic cabinet, which Lincoln must then manage while exhorting his administration to follow his leadership. In fact, the overriding point with this superb narrative is Goodwin extoling the seemingly limitless political acumen of Lincoln while he oversees a time in American history as crucial as any before or since.    Crucial members of his administration are profiled here, providing the reader with a unique, sort of \\"back-door\\" look at the Lincoln presidency. We see how the personalities of Edward Bates (Attorney General), Simon Cameron (Secretary of War), William Seward (Secretary of State), Gideon Wells (Secretary of the Navy) and Salmon Chase (Secretary of the Treasury) are generally elitist in nature and condescending to Lincoln in particular while initially being astounded that such a seemingly torpid character could become president. Asked to then participate in the administration in cabinet level positions, they almost collectively see their role as administering and reigning over the government while Lincoln serves largely as a figurehead. Goodwin's mastery here is showing the slow evolvement of Lincoln's ability to form a cohesive advisory body while applying his heretofore unseen political prowess in managing the government in an ever broadening crisis that threatens separation of the Union.     He takes office and is immediately faced with increasing southern secessionism and forced to take action to maintain the Union. The start of and subsequent prosecution of the Civil War absorbs his administration...Goodwin provides a dissecting view of the war from the government's perspective and shows again and again how Lincoln is adept at taking and managing one crisis after another. Topics such as his inserting himself into the war strategic effort where he recognizes the ineffectiveness of George McClellan, the dismissal of Cameron as Secretary of War with the brilliant decision to insert Edwin Stanton in his place and his administering of domestic policy to meet the war effort are given a fascinating review by Goodwin that goes far in further amplifying Lincoln's stature as a great executive. He finds an obscure general in Ulysses Grant and inserts him as commander of the war effort... another prescient decision that accelerates the conclusion of the war. All this while continuing to build strong and ever growing loyalties among his partisans forcing them (with the exception of Chase who continues to vehemently disagree and disparage Lincoln) to reconsider their initial perceptions of him and his leadership capabilities. Goodwin is overwhelmingly illustrative of the forming of these ties and the deep personal affection that each cabinet member thus renders.    The denouement of the war and Lincoln's assassination with the subsequent actions of the government, particularly Stanton, are the highlights of the book. We see the heart wrenching outpouring of affection and respect from the American public and the administration as all recognize that a great leader is no longer among us. The disarray that follows Lincoln's death is certified when Andrew Johnson takes office and we see how his southern leaning tendencies is the arbiter of a long and unnecessarily drawn out reconstruction effort...Goodwin compares this with how Lincoln may have handled reconstruction and determines that a much more compassionate and reasoned effort would have most assuredly ensued.    There are a surprising number of authors of historical biographies that are criticized for deification of their subject...and true, some of these paint their character study in an unreasonable light, but not so with this magnificent investigation of the Lincoln presidency by Doris Goodwin. An estimable scrutiny of his political faculty integrated with a marvelous historical narrative, Goodwin makes Lincoln \\"hero worship\\" chic while dispassionate at the same time, a tough combination. Highest recommendation.  .
B00000G3PA|5.0|Just because we're all doomed doesn't mean you still can't laugh. I think that's the best way to describe Bruce's 1998 action-blockbuster epic picture, \\"Armageddon.\\" And that makes it so much more unique and fun to watch because no other end-of-the-world movie takes themselves less seriously than this one. I hate watching a movie and being preached at (like \\"2012\\" did.) Instead, \\"Armageddon\\" removes itself from the equation and the producers, writers and director were all intelligent enough to realize that this is a movie, and people want to be entertained.     Bruce plays Harry, an oil driller who is recruited by NASA to go into outer space to save the world from destruction. Bruce played this role as he did any of his other signature characters with perfection and precision. Even though he wasn't in every scene (there is a very long list of very talented actors in this, including Ben Affleck) his presence could always be felt. And in the scenes that Bruce was in he almost stepped back and let the others take control, his larger than life persona did not overtake any of the other cast members. Only a very generous and humbled man could accomplish such an endeavor. But like they say, slow and steady always wins the race.     Once Harry tells the NASA head (Billy Bob Thornton) that he needs his team to get the job done the fun in inner space really starts. His entire team (everyone from Steve Buscemi to Michael Clarke Duncan) were all hysterical. The story was so ludicrous and implausible that you just have to laugh at it.     If you enjoy sci-fi, astronomy or just Bruce Willis than this movie is for you.
B001PB3RU8|3.0|Don't let my three star review throw anyone off... I don't overhype reviews and this album only scores a three in my rating schema because there are really just three songs on the album that have strong enough hooks to be iPod worthy. But, wow, those three songs are stunners!    The tracks \\"Dog days are over\\", \\"Rabbit heart\\", and \\"You've got the love\\" have me moving me everytime they play.  With a voice that is an exotic cocktail mix somewhere between Neko Case and Feist this group pairs unique vocals with fresh melodies. I heartily recommend \\"Lungs\\" and still consider it one of the best albums of 2009 (which was admittedly a very weak year in music). I guess what is most disappointing is Florence can win big airtime and top ten hits in the UK while our dumbed-down music scene in the US can only spoon feed us more Lady BlahBlah. Sad.

B001GKJ2DY|3.0|Mamma Mia / B001GKJ2DY<br /><br />I'm generally not a fan of \\"jukebox musicals\\" - musicals that are based around a group of pre-existing songs, with a loosely strung-together plot to connect the dots between the songs on the soundtrack. I went into Mamma Mia not realizing that it was a jukebox musical for ABBA songs, and I left disappointed.<br /><br />Not that there's anything wrong with the songs on here - they're catchy and upbeat, if you like that sort of thing - that is, if you like ABBA. If you're not here for the ABBA songs, though, the musical comes off as flimsy and anemic - with several plot points seemingly out of place, largely in order to lead into another ABBA song. Indeed, without the basic understanding that \\"Mamma Mia\\" is a jukebox musical, a lot of songs feel strangely out of place - \\"Honey, Honey\\", in particular, seems oddly sensual for a young woman to be fantasizing about her mother's lovers. The setting and timeline, too, are badly muddled - the musical takes place in Greece, but \\"Mamma Mia!\\" carries Italian overtones, and \\"Our Last Summer\\" wistfully places them in France when, to judge from all other plot points, they weren't. Mama mia, but this is very confusing to a viewer not in the know.<br /><br />If you really like ABBA songs, you may enjoy this musical, but I found the soundtrack to be the strongest feature of this movie. The actual plot itself is very flimsy, and often feels like an excuse to rush to the next song. The acting and singing is superb, and the movie is well-cast, but it's hard to hang a meaningful, compelling plot on a handful of catchy dance songs.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll
1594489505|5.0|There are far better writers here than myself to explain what this book is about and why it is so special. But I just needed to say that this is one of the few books that made me cry uncontrollably when I finished it. It is truly the very essence of what it means to \\"pay respects\\" to one we have lost. I walked around wide awake for days and look forward to reading it again. A highly moving story that exposes the burdens that compassionate, dutiful women have had to carry for misguided patriarchal thinking and behavior, not only in islamic societies but all and everywhere.
B00337KM2S|4.0|[[ASIN:B00337KM2S Up in the Air]] is a dark drama told from the point of view of a management consultant and the various people who pass in and out of his life.  He spends most of his time on the road.  His job, laying people off, is not the most logical source of comedic material.<br /><br />To many, the foundations of a good film are big name actors, A-list directing and a current subject.  But I have always thought that the foundation of any good film is the same as any good book: a good story based upon interesting ideas.  In that sense, the most important thing I gained by watching this movie was a keen desire to read the book upon which it was based.  I have not yet read the novel [[ASIN:B000QCSATA Up in the Air]] by Walter Kirn.  But, I will soon.  Because this story is based upon extremely interesting ideas.<br /><br />This is not a *one-size-fits-all* kind of a story.  This story will appeal to a certain group of people yet it is bound to polarize audiences.  The key thing you have to ask yourself before you purchase this movie is, \\"Am I in the group of people that will appreciate this movie, or will I be bored with it?\\"  If you are looking for traditional movie entertainment, this movie is NOT for you.  It's slow, deliberate, and at times depressing.  But if you have a dark sense of humor and can appreciate films that portray life's darkness without apologies, then you will likely appreciate this movie and where it eventually leads.<br /><br />About 60% of the way through this movie, I was ready to relegate this to the \\"average\\" category.  Sure, there were a lot of things that I loved about the movie.  I could relate to the dialogue and I could see the deeper significance that belies the story.  The paradox between isolation and freedom have seldom been dealt with so directly in a mainstream film.  And yet there were obvious problems.  It is true that some of the dialogue is trite and forced.  At times, the movie drags on, though I believe there is a purpose for that.  The point is, if you focus on any one element, it is not perfect.  In that sense, it's a lot like real life.  And in some ways, this movie captures the isolation of travelling for work better than any other that I could think of.<br /><br />But then at a certain point, the movie comes together.  As far as the plot goes, the actual events that occur are all predictable.  And yet the plot is executed in an honest way.  It never feels like a plot point was added to either throw us off or to conform to a clich&eacute;.  It feels more like a recounting than a telling of a story, which is the best compliment a dark comedy can receive.<br /><br />I love the cast of this movie, though to be honest none of them were given tremendously great lines when looked at as individual parts.  This movie is really more than a sum of its parts.<br /><br />While the core plot is very well structured, there are story elements that I might have done differently.  Some of the politically incorrect dialogue given to Clooney's character seems forced.  Yet the story is strong enough to overcome those small things.  By the end of the film, the things that were annoying in the beginning become after-thoughts.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this film much more than I thought I would.

Well, after a few months of all my friends saying how amazing they are, i had to buy it and start reading it. I FELL IN LOVE! I read the whole series in 1 week. Every minute my kids and husband where asleep i was reading till i had to get up the next day.<br /><br />People say Breaking Dawn is not as good. I loved it! Maybe being a mother helped that.

B002I9Z8CG|5.0|\\"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\\" is my favorite Star Trek film, there is not a moment in it that I do not love.  I love Star Trek II and Star Trek VI also, but I love this film just a little bit more.  Most of you know the plot: an alien entity is menacing the earth of the 23rd century.  Kirk, Spock and the gang must go back to 1986 San Francisco, in their captured Klingon vessel, to bring back 2 hump-backed whales, (extinct in the 23rd century,) to communicate with this entity.    What do I love about this film?  Practically every scene.  Directed by Leonard Nimoy, the cast has never been better.  I especially love the scenes of Kirk and Spock trying to deal with the 20th century: getting on a bus and then getting right off because they do not know the meaning of \\"exact change,\\" Scotty trying to speak to the computer by speaking into the mouse, Spock's mind-meld with the whales after climbing into the tank at the marineland where they are on display.  (Watch the faces William Shatner makes when Kirk spots Spock under the water with the whales, before anyone else sees it, hilarious.)  Catherine Hicks is both beautiful and adorable as Gillian, the marine specialist, who helps Kirk and the crew obtain the whales after they are released into the open sea.  (There is a scene with Kirk, Spock and Gillian in Gillian's pickup where they debate going to eat Italian food that is brilliantly funny.)  (As hard as this is to believe, Paramount was in discussions with Eddie Murphy, their biggest star at the time, to originally play the role eventually played by Catherine Hicks.  Nimoy actually went to discuss it with Murphy who thankfully at that time had already lost interest.  Murphy would have ruined this Star Trek film the way Richard Pryor ruined \\"Superman III.\\")  There is another hilarious scene where Uhura and Chekov, needing to locate a \\"Nuclear wessel,\\" (I won't say why,) speak to some ditzy young woman attempting to get directions to Alemeda, where the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, Enterprise is docked.  The reason this scene is so funny is because allegedly this was a real person who did not know she was being filmed, not an actress.  There is a San Francisco cop suspiciously eyeing the Russian, Chekov, that I have heard was real as well.  I have just barely scratched the surface of why I love this film.  I even like the music of Leonard Rosenman, never one of my favorite composers.  (Most of his music sounds like the soundtrack of Marcus Welby, MD, whose music he also composed.)Although he really doesn't touch Jery Goldsmith on ST-TMP Or James Horner on Star Trek II. (A minor quibble.)  Star Trek IV was the highest grossing Trek film until last summer's Star Trek reboot.  The ending where Admiral Kirk is busted back to Captain, (as a result of the events in Star Trek III,) and he and the crew are all reassigned to the new USS Enterprise, (the original Enterprise destroyed in the previous film,) never fails to bring a tear to my eye.  Star Trek IV continued the trend of the even-numbered Star Trek films being the best.  As stated, it is very close between this and ST II: TWOK, but this is my favorite Trek film.  The picture and sound quality on the blu-ray are excellent.  However, the special features are basically the same as the deluxe Star Trek IV DVD.  Heaven forbid Paramount go out of its way to give us some new features.

I will grant it is my fault that I didn't  get time to watch this for over a month, but a defective DVD is a DEFECTIVE DVD.     For all the years I have been an Amazon Prime customer, youd think they'd allow a return on a defective DVD without charging their customer for it.    I hope you get a DVD that works. Otherwise you'll pay double to get it from Amazon. I think I will buy it elsewhere now so if I get another defective copy I can actually return it and get my money back.    Yay PINK. Boo Amazon.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I just bought and did my first workout with Julian and I am very excited to continue with this. I have to say that sadly I didn't make it all the way through my first time because I am out of shape but she is very motivating and thats exactly what I need. This DVD consists of 3 levels of 20 minute workouts. You start at the beginner level and when you are ready to progress, you move on to the next level. I used to use Hip-hop abs before, and it was a joke compared to this. Jullian utilizes every opportunity to tone you up in the least amount of time here. It is very high intensity but it can be done by anyone who is serious about losing weight, even beginners, and you can't beat 20 minutes a day!
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|this was my 1st n. sparks book and i have to say i'm impressed. this was one of the first books to make me cry. you could really feel the emotion and relate to the characters. i'm a romantic at heart and this made me realize that there are so many types of love.  i literally read this in one night.  A+++   a must read!!

B000W03RHQ|4.0|I think that \\"End Of An Era\\" is one of Nightwish's best. I have not quit listening to it since I bought it through Amazon. The female vocals are great. This is one of the few Finnish metal bands that I listen to. The price was right and the delivery was fast and cheap. That is one of the reasons that I always buy from Amazon.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|1) I like science fiction movies that look like my video games.  2) I don't care for movies that require me to follow the story line.  3) I hate it when I have to pay attention to the stuff in the movie that's not cool explosions and stuff.  4) I didn't understand 2), but I understood 3).    If you answered yes to any of the above statements, you're gonna hate this movie.  Otherwise, you're in for a real treat.
B000024E9H|5.0|I won't bother to review this recording for its artistic merits, other than to say it is a favorite of mine. Back in the '80's, the old CD Review magazine listed \\"Nursey Cryme\\" in its list of worst albums of all time, while keyboard wizard Keith Emerson is quoted in Armando Gallo's \\"Genesis: Evolution of a Rock Band\\" as raving \\"No Bull, their new album really is incredible!\\" in 1971. Being deeply suspicious that a great 5-channel surround sound recording could be made from an old 16-channel master tape, I bought the European 2008 stereo remix CD version, which includes a nice booklet and a garish, hot pink Charisma CD. (I have never seen that version of the Charisma label before and hope to never see it again.)<br /><br />This recording was made in 1971 at the U.K.'s famous Trident studio. It's a good thing that an Amazon review doesn't require that you cite your sources, because I don't recall exactly where I read that one of the band members said that Trident didn't have the best equipment at the time and that contributed to Nursery Cryme's somewhat distant, muffled sound. (I suspect this was in a Melody Maker interview, since I spent quite a few hours in the CSULB library in Southern California back in the '70's!)<br /><br />After listening to the 2-channel remix by Nick Davis with Jeff Callingham and Tony Banks, I'm somewhat in awe of the amount of life they were able to bring to this 16-track production. It sounds as if the tracks came from different reels of multitrack tape, as some are better preserved than others. Opening song, \\"The Musical Box,\\" must have been particularly difficult. Listening on electrostatic headphones, I could sometimes hear the different tracks being switched on and off, some accompanied by a slight, but noticeable buzz. This was probably in the original issue of the LP and CD, but was masked by the background hiss of the stereo master tape. (The hiss is pretty loud on the older issues, including the \\"Definitive Edition Remaster\\" version from the '90's. Apparently that is just the way the old stereo master tape sounds.) There's also some distortion in louder passages, but Pete's vocals are much more life like than on any previous version.<br /><br />The songs that really stand out to me are \\"Return of the Giant Hogweed,\\" and \\"The Fountain of Salmacis.\\" On these tracks, the vocals are again quite clear and the drums are quite lively. I could easily get pulled into the action (and both of these songs are the rock/roll equivalent of an  \\"action-adventure\\" movie) as Phil switched from playing the full drum set to focussing on the tom toms. (It's hard to believe he was only 20 years old at this time.) The microphone placement was spot-on for picking up that \\"pounding skins\\" sound, but the phenomenal drum sound they would achieve on later recordings like \\"Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" or \\"ABACAB\\" isn't there yet. Guitars and keyboards are bold and beautiful and I would describe the sound on this remix as having a \\"vintage character\\" that is probably very close to what the band and engineer heard in the control room in 1971, before the noisy stereo master that many of us have listened to for so many years was created..

0739416707|4.0|Although the story begins slowly, (due to Du Maurier's painstakingly descriptive writing style), it nevertheless vividly sets the dark and gloomy atmosphere that pervades Manderly, the ancestral home of the hero, Max de Winter who is tormented by a dark secret.<br /><br />This is an excellent novel for those students of early 20th century British society and mores, and for those who like a good \\"who done it\\".
B001V7YWTQ|3.0|I haven't heard the album yet, but do recognize all of the titles from various albums I own or have sampled. Being almost as old as these two, I can appreciate where they have been in life. After reading Clapton's autobiography it is amazing he can still get on the stage at all(which might explain the renewed enthusiasm) Have always enjoyed Winwood's vocals. A tribute to still enjoying your work after so many repetitions.

B002NXSSBU|5.0|I think this is the last \\"Great\\" Stewart LP. From True Blue to Twistin' each song is very good, and of course don't forget the musicians on this. With the Faces playing on this what more do I need to say. This is the best I have heard this unless you can track down a clean vinyl version. I've had this on 8 track and it the music holds up all these years later. Grab it while you can.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|All I can say is very well done, I see some parallels between Avatar and the Abyss (another James Cameron movie) both movies send the same message.  The message is that we as humans must stop raping nature and stop the savagery among ourselves and other living beings.  Let's hope the message reaches those who are in charge.

B0002XH9Z4|5.0|If you're looking at this product, The Michael Jackson Collection (released in 2004), then you are either a fan of MJ or know someone who is and are looking for a gift. In either cases this is a great collection which covers his whole career, and  best of all the songs are all in order of release. You get songs, hits, unreleased tracks, demos and rarities(you can check the top reviews which describes the content and judge by yourself if this is worth it).If you're considering buying a compilation but would like to go one step further this might be what you're looking for. It doesn't cost a whole lot, is affordable and offers a lot for the price trust me; I've paid much more for less. The fact that you also get the excellent Live In Bucharest DVD with the set is another great reason to buy it. Do the math, buy the Bucharest DVD and a greatest hits compilation and there isn't a huge difference with the price of this set and you get much more with The Ultimate Collection. If you already have the DVD and own the original songs it is still worth buying for the unreleased content.A great way to honor the work of a great man.

B000IJ79WU|1.0|If Superman can turn back time at his whim, why go through the time and effort of fighting villains at all?  Time travel is such a cheat in story-telling.  And here's a thought:  If Superman turned back time in The Movie, thus undoing all the damage caused by the missiles, then shouldn't the rocket that destroyed the Phantom Zone in this cut of Superman II also have been undone?  Time travel.  End Superman: The Movie this way, and it's a bit annoying, but okay.  End the sequel the same way?  Really silly if you ask me.      Then again, we have the \\"magic kiss\\" of the Lester version.  Either way you go, sheesh.      That said, Donner's cut is too problematic.  I can see why they replaced him with Lester.  Lester's cut isn't perfect either, but it is preferable to me.  Rent this if you're just curious to see what you're missing, but don't buy it.  If you do buy it, you'll regret it.  Then you'll have to fly around the earth super fast thus reversing its rotation thus reversing time all so you can get your money back.  Save yourself the hassle.
1416572287|4.0|\\"How to Teach Physics to Your Dog\\" is a fun read, no doubt about it.  It is very cute, taking high-level physics into the backyard, and turning quantum-everything into squirrels and bunnies for the dog to chase.  If you've heard about \\"Quantum Physics\\" and you are just starting out in trying to figure out what that means, then definitely, this is the book for you.<br /><br />However, for those of us who have been science geeks for years (I'm a Professional Engineer and total science geek), there isn't anything new here to learn.  It's a cute rehash of what I already knew.<br /><br />This is quantum physics at it's simplest, and most accessible level.  Shooting at that - accessible - target, Orzel does a WONDERFUL job of making the complex understandable.  If that is where you are - then by all means, read this - I highly recommend this book for that level of reader.<br /><br />Beyond that level -- well, it's still a cute book.  Orzel and Emmy (his dog) have some fun conversations, and it's a nice, light, and very enjoyable read.

1400052173|4.0|Whether you know it or not it's very likely that your tissues or blood samples are on file somewhere.  They may be sitting in lab freezers at military facilities, in biotech companies, or hospitals.  They may be used for research into something you find objectionable, or a researcher may have already taken out a patent on your genes, selling licenses to other labs for hundreds of thousands of dollars.  And you will likely never find out and have no legal recourse.<br /><br />Henrietta Lacks was 31 years old when she died of cervical cancer in 1951.  She left behind a husband and five children.  But that wasn't all she left behind.  A sample of cancerous cells were taken from her cervix for research purposes - not an uncommon occurrence - and she wasn't told - also not an uncommon occurrence (neither in 1951 nor today).  The extraordinary thing about her cells, however, is that they're still alive and are all over the world.  They're known as HeLa and are among the very very few cells that have ever continued to grow and multiply and reproduce endlessly, making them extremely valuable for research.  In fact, HeLa is directly responsible for some of the most amazing advances in science - the development of the polio vaccine, in vitro fertilization, cancer research, cloning, gene mapping, etc.  They've been to space and inside nuclear bombs, they've contaminated cell cultures worldwide, and they are bought and sold every day.  Neither she nor her family knew anything about it, and they can't even afford health insurance.<br /><br />This is an interesting and important book and, in my opinion, has the potential to cause a revolution in the medical research and pharmaceutical industry.  Rebecca Skloot has written not a dry scientific text but a human story about Henrietta and her family and the stress and strain it has caused them.  It's important to note - and the book makes this very clear - that the use of her tissues wasn't done with any malicious intent. But in addition to the advances, and as Henrietta's story has become more widely known, have come a host of ethical and legal questions which are just beginning to be discussed.  The book isn't always pleasant - the Lacks family has had a rough time - and at times it sounds more like a travelogue of Ms. Skloot's journey to learn the story behind HeLa.  But it will certainly give you something to think about.  It certainly left me feeling a bit uneasy.vances, and as Henrietta's story has become more widely known, have come a host of ethical and legal questions which are just beginning to be discussed.

I wish the wires that the planets were on were a little longer so the planets would be a bit further apart (but we may be able to buy some longer wires and retrofit them).<br /><br />My 5 year old daughter got this for Christmas and she loves it. She turns it on before bed and enjoys watching the planets go around. It is not too loud.
1400108608|3.0|I purchased this audio book to introduce my 10 year old daughter to Little Women.  We began listening to it while driving on a seven hour trip.  We found that while the story can still engage a modern reader, this version of the audio book was not well delivered.  The recording is just a bit flat.  The reader sounds like the schoolteacher from Little House on the Prairie.  The production does not deliver on the emotional aspect that underlies the text.  Maybe we've been spoiled by superb audio-book readers like Jim Dale.  But I found this recording a bit disappointing.  My daughter finished by book from a print copy rather than continue to listen.

It is a good reference to see the correct form and muscles being used in various exercises and the details of the drawings are wonderful.  It also has tips for avoiding injuries and working around them if they do happen.  All-in-all I am very pleased with this book, if you are into body building or just interested in how the muscles work during motion I would highly recommend this book.
B00005MM01|5.0|No need to address the specific content or the hippie-days nostalgia, this has been done well and amply by previous reviewers. I'd merely like to say that, beyond those considerations, musically this is an album that is timeless. Melodic inventiveness at its peak, simplicity of chord progressions hiding small harmonic complexities, done with restraint and elegance, and great attention to the sound. Never has an acoustic guitar sounded quite like this, seldom has Donovan sung with such modesty, without falsetto pyrotechnics overstating the fact that he had one of the better voices of the era. He had already made it clear earlier that the comparisons with Dylan were ridiculous, although the media, always starved for a jingoistic concept, would cling to this notion against all evidence pretty much for the rest of his career (including today, when the distinction between the two is as obvious as it could ever be). With this album, Donovan cemented his independence, his enormous and original creativity, and his place in the Pantheon of superlative composers. It doesn't matter if you're bored with the whole atmosphere and really prefer to listen to Nine Inch Nails, if you're even just moderately aware of the qualities required to put music together that might pass universally for \\"good music,\\" you will acknowledge the presence of such qualities here, whether you continue listening or chuck the CD in the trash later.
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|This movie has one problem, KATIE HOLMES! She isnt in this movie so it kind of ruined it when they used another actress, otherwise this movie is awesome 5 stars all the way. I have a thing, I like to see the same actors/actress in sequels and trilogies, it keeps that flavor.
B001N26GFM|5.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is extremely intense, even painful, but so beautifully done that one becomes pulled in.  In this film, we see the holocaust through the eyes of innocence - and the eyes are German.  We experience the story in the heart of a loving family - and the family is German.  Because of that viewpoint, we can understand a little better how people remained morally unchallenged during the holocaust, even when the ghastly truth was literally just outside their gates.  We can see, achingly, that we, as good people, are not immune to allowing that which we now condemn in hindsight.  The film draws parallels between the world of the camp, with the striped clothing those interred there must wear behind electrified fences, and the stark, fortress-like house in which the German commandant's family lives, with it's barred stair rail and locked, guarded fence.  We come to see that both groups are, in very different ways, imprisoned.  The fact that the main characters, Bruno and Schmuel, are each eight years old, allows us to feel tenderly toward them in their different innocent circumstances, and levels our sympathies.  Bruno's mother is a sensitive and nurturing woman, and the daughter dabbles with the Reich teachings  and the Reich heroes in the manner that we'd recognize in a twelve-year-old girl of today idolizing media stars.  We are even shown the loving father inside the proud, severe military commandant.  This makes experiencing the film very difficult, as the viewer becomes emotionally engaged in the friendship between Schmuel inside the camp, and Bruno with his warm German family in their compound.<br /><br /> As a retired teacher I recall the difficulties of encouraging young people to understand this time in history.  To them, the holocaust is something that happened long ago, done buy a known monster, and something that they, as modern people, simply wouldn't do.  I wish I'd had this film to help them open their eyes to the commonality of people.  It shows us that Germans of the holocaust were ordinary people, too.  The film is fiction, but somehow it is truer than a documentary because it lets us into the hearts of those who lived in that time, and leads us to recognize that  the kind of thinking that lead to the holocaust is not, most unfortunately, banished to the distant past.  The seeds of the holocaust flowered into horrible fruit then, and the same seeds are within each of us now.  The film shows us through the commandant's innocent family that expressions of hate can devastate the hater as well.  We have an obligation to pass on the story of the holocaust to the current generation, so the mindset which lead to the atrocities can be recognized and avoided. Though it is difficult viewing, parents should watch it with children whom they judge capable, so that the priceless understanding that comes through the film will not be lost to the future.t shows us that Germans of the holocaust were ordinary people, too.

B000JVSUS4|4.0|First of all, This movie is great, and even better on bluray. As far as entertainment goes its 5 stars but i gave this movie 4 stars because there was too much love story telling more than the actual pearl harbor story. It was a bit distracting when the blood is rushing and flowing in other parts of my body besides my brain, I like the love story, but i feel it overpowered the historical attack on pearl harbor, the Movie is called \\"Pearl Harbor\\" so I feel it should focus more on the historical facts more than the love story. Also near the end, when the airforce plans a counter attack, it would be nice to see more war and fighting action, but instead it was a sad ending.      I am a history major at uc irvine and i learned in one of my classes that there was more depth in why japan attacked pearl harbor. It would be nice if this movie could explain that, but there are too many details to go into as far as japan/usa politics,I had to buy 2 textbooks for that class which covered a lot of material, it was interesting, but also a challenge to read that much. the movie would be way too long, but i wouldn't mind. Basically like the saying goes,\\" a good defense is a good offense\\". That is basically why japan attacked pearl harbor. But the movie didn't clearly show the reasons for why pearl harbor was attacked, it just jumped straight into: japan attacking pearl harbor and when and where are they going to strike? It would be more interesting to show a story with a wider spectrum of the attack on pearl harbor start to finish, and not focus so much on the love story. As for the love story,        I thought kate beckinsale was awesome, but the only problem is that she is so darn good looking that it actually distracted me from focusing on the movie. That is why i give this movie 4 stars because im afraid the may have made a mistake casting such a sexy lady to play the role. shes so darn sexy that I just focus about her and not the movie.      Anyway it would have been 5 stars if they did not use such a gorgeous hot sexy woman, i was a little hot and bothered, but for those who arent as perverted as i am, this bluray is an awesome 5 stars for those who do not easily get distracted by beautiful women.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|great show...me and my children loved it....one of his best shows ever!!! a few songs were lip synced but not 2 sad or surprised because with the amount of dancing he had i expected it...would love to have a show with blu ray quality but if you are a MJ fan and do not own this then do not hesitate
B001O7JHSE|5.0|This movie is great because it hits a spot in your heart, even though I give this movie 5 stars, it can be disturbing to watch in certain scenes.  Bluray is awesome, the picture quality is so sharp I can see the actors pores on their skin.        499 people give this movie 5 stars and i see 29 people give it 2 stars or less, made me try and figure out why, and see from other peoples point of view. Yes this movie is stereotypical, but some stereotypes are true, and some are false. Yes not every young white person is racist, duh. And not all black people commit crimes, duh. etc etc etc. Basically this movie has a deep message that we all face, most people have racist and prejudice  thoughts, but to different degrees. Some are extreme, some are peaceful and theres people in between. We as human carry this deadly virus that can either consume us, or if we choose, cure ourselves and live a happy enlightening life. But like a virus that hides deep wihtin our body, we need to dig down deep to find ourselves first before we can start fighting back for the good. The message this movie is sending cannot be any clearer. \\"HATE IS BAGGAGE\\". So true.       Those people who rated this movie with 2 stars or less have the right to their opinion, but after thinking and pondering, I can only conclude, that they may have some personal issues deep within that they may not want to face, because the truth can hurt you. Just like with anything. Whether you confront and face your fears or the truth, it can set you free. I give this movie 5 stars for 2 reasons, first it does it excellent job entertaining you which is why people watch movies, and secondly, it has a really good message that contributes to improving the quality of life, because after all, white, black, brown, yellow, pink, orange, red, or purple, we are all brothers and sisters one with the universe and until you cannot understand that concept, you will always be a victim of endless suffering caused of your own weakness. \\"Hate is baggage\\" what a simple yet profound message this movie emphasizes and reminds those who get caught up in the storm of hatred. Hatred is so powerful, is the what will consume life if we as humans let it, one day there will be no earth left, hatred is the most deadliest, potent, evil, dark, form of energy that can completely take over ones mind and change oneself completely. Hatred is so deadly because people under estimate its power over the mind. Yes most people understand the concept of hate, but once it has captured your mind, it is almost impossible to free yourself from it as your mind becomes saturated with such evil. Whether is is temporary or chronic, it can destroy lives in a second, or for thousands of years. \\"Hate is baggage\\", why do you want to carry baggage when you dont need it? I know that personally, I hate carrying baggage whether it weighs 2 lbs. or 50 lbs or 100 lbs. Just throw it away in the trash.
B0017PCX20|5.0|No matter how hard I try, I could never stand Radiohead or NIN. They are way too noisy. Too much fluff not enough music. This however, is a completely different ball game altogether. Music here is absolutely breathtaking! A Lot like the stuff from Katatonia and Porcupine Tree but not a copy cat by no means. Just the caliber of highest quality tunes. If you never heard of this band or did not listen to this album. You have been missing out. Don't waste anymore time. Keep an open mind and if you have an eternal thirst for beautiful music, I promise you would be gravely satisfied. Last 15 minute track \\"Too Much To Lose\\" sums it all up. There is just too much to loose if you haven't listened to these guys. Another awesome band in the Classic Rock/Prog Rock genre and I hope they continue to make music like this in the future and very soon they will get their proper recognition. Enjoy the music! Later guys...
B002JCMZA0|5.0|This CD is one you will never stop playing. The DVD has a beautiful final track with Diana's husband Elvis Costello and Elton John joining her. You can see what a great family life she has. Diana often mentions how she misses her husband when she is performing overseas on one of her international DVDs. A happy home life has contributed to Diana's maturity as an artist. This CD is just perfection.
0321344758|4.0|My first impression was that this book was way too basic...but then, on second thoughts, the problem with most UI designs is that the basics are ignored while we are in search of the holy grail. Steve Krug identifies the fundamental tenets of UI design (simplicity, self-explanatory, design for scanning, importance of navigational elements etc.) and reminds us to internalize them. All the points mentioned in the book should be self-evident and obvious; if we take enough time to step back and think about these things one will naturally come to these conclusions. The value I see in this book is not in any new ideas or techniques it introduces, but in identifying the basics and reminding us not to stray from them. In summary, the book reminds me the quote of an accomplished designer, \\"it is only by remaining as close as possible to the pure function of the object that beauty can be achieved\\"

I bought Travelogue and sat down to listen to it when I could steal a few moments alone at home. I immediately turned it off-because I loved it too much. I immediately sensed the respect it deserved, that I needed more time than I had, and to listen to it at a later date. WEll, that didn't happen for about 6+ years. I'd listened to JM when the material was new, and have a couple on vinyl. I tend to listen to the music more than the lyrics, and her young voice sometimes annoyed me. The poetry usually escapes me.  By now, her voice is mature, and it seems to me that she has finally grown into her songs. How could someone so young write these songs for the ages? (I often wonder that about a lot of music from the 60's and 70's, not just Joni). It's almost as if she put down this music to be dealt with or finished at a later time, knowing that she was so prolific that she'd never remember it all unless she did. If you're like me and have to be hit over the head to understand the meaning of the lyrics, I suggest you peruse the album reviews of all her albums here. Tons of insight there, by many \\"even\\" more eloquent than I, who did not put down JM for 30+years between then and now. Seeing the performance at the Olympics, I will now make Joni a hobby. For me it was the highlight of the show.l
B0000248VB|2.0|When shopping, I was excited by the list of songs on the CD and was looking forward to listening.  Unfortunately, the songs lack the wonderful vocals and orchestral back-up I was expecting.  Many of the songs have that 'Hammond Organ' sound.  I am disappointed.
0446567329|2.0|I admit, I was excited to read my first Nicholas Sparks book. After hearing how wonderful he is for years I finally picked one up. My friend told me to read Dear John because she was crying when she read it, after a few pages of the book, I was in tears myself, the writing was so awful. His idea was a good one, but there was no substance to his writing, it was cliche filled and everything was \\"forever\\" and \\"deep\\" when really, there was nothing going on, the romance, the suspense, the waiting and waiting and waiting amounted to nothing spectacular and overall, I finished the book out of obligation to my friend, even though I wanted to quit after the first few chapters.   Dear John, however, did have one very big redeeming factor, which was the father-son relationship. It was touching and it was something new. In the movie, Channing Tatum who is not known for his fantastic acting skills did bring me to tears in the emotional scene with his dad. I won't give too much away but I would almost venture to say that it was worthwhile to read the book and see the movie just for that relationship.   If you are looking for a good read or a challenging read, it's not going to rock your world. But it is not a complete waste of time.
1441498141|3.0|This book is NOT for real Christians!<br /><br />By one of the biggest anti-christians ever, Darwin.<br /><br />Not worth being in a library, a school, or your home.<br /><br />Sadly, some people still cling to these lies.  Its also long.
0670021652|3.0|I too loved Eat, Pray, Love but knew enough not to expect Committed to be quite the same. I was drawn in by the beginning but got a bit slogged down in the middle. I learned some interesting things about marriage and society along the way. Still, the personal moments and journeys are the parts I will remember because they were painted so vibrantly with words.
B0035MNSPY|3.0|After years of waiting, Fear Factory, or what we're supposed to percieve is Fear Factory, has finally released a new album... But there's something missing... Or rather, there's TWO things missing: Christian Olde Woblers and Raymond Hererra.    I'm not the first, nor I will be the last to disagree with the lineup, but with Rhys and Dino back in the manifold, this album comes out strong, with Burton's growls and Dino's riffs still at the top of their game, and Gene \\"The Atomic Clock\\" Hogland's trademark style of drumming rounds things out. Byron's bass goes without saying, as his efforts on the last two albums were nothing short of amazing.     Even so, I can't say this is Fear Factory without Ray's drumming, and frankly, neither can Christian and Ray themselves.    The lineup is more Supergroup than anything, but the sound is still Fear Factory at its finest. Reccommended if you can deal with the Political BS of 2 founding members being dismissed with no notice whatsoever.    Favorite songs in my opinion are the Title Track, Powershifter, and the soon to be VERY controversial Christploitation (Bear in mind, I am a Christian myself    I would have given it 5 stars, but by now, you know what I took them away for.

B002E01LL6|3.0|This is generally not my kind of movie, but I did like it as it had kind of a Rocky element going. I also thought the actors gave sincere performances and the story was gritty enough to keep your attention - I get bored easily.  As I watched it, I really felt this movie had a lot of potential to be great but because it was kind of rushed, it couldn't quite get there.  If it could have taken a little more time to develop the characters and their relationships, it might have gotten there.  I know that Channing Tatum is always criticized for his non acting ability, but if you really watch this movie, you can sense his potential, there were several times that you got a sincere sense from him that his character really wanted to do the right thing and Tatum does this more with expression than words.  The only other thing that I feel could have been better was the connection between Shawn and Zulay, I just didn't get a sense of actual attraction, it really seemed kind of forced, like there was no choice. Obviously not one of the best movies of 2009 but certainly one of the better ones.  I hope you enjoy it.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I just made a single CD of all of Sade's CDs, and when I play the songs randomly \\"Soldier of Love\\" fits in quite nicely with past efforts, even though the songs on this new CD have an edgier feel to them.  I no longer hear the forlorn emotion of the past, one that might have been from a younger woman.  I find these new songs to be more assertive in lyric, although the music is just as textured as before.  Truly, I can never get tired of listening to Sade, looping and looping on my CD player.

B000001DTM|5.0|Simply put, one of their greatest albums, which makes it one of the greatest rock albums of all time.  The fact that they made such a bold departure from the sound and style that make them the world's biggest band at the end of the 80's is a testament to their artistry.  It also paved the way for much less successful incarnations throughout the 90's and their rebirth in the 00's.  The only band of the past quarter century that can truly go toe-to-toe with the legends of the 60's.
B000FWAOVI|5.0|This book was a favorite as a child and I have looked for it many times over the years.

I ordered it immediately! The shipping was prompt and it arrived just as described and packaged appropriately. Thanks so much!!
B002M3GPOI|3.0|Ah, the album we all know and love. They should have included the Plumpton Race Course, Marquee, and Victoria Ballroom gigs. They are all better shows and quality than the ones included. Also, Victoria has Drop In. How could this ignore a version of Drop In? I hope Fripp will rerelease these. Also, they should have skipped the 2004 version. We all have that. They should have skipped the DVD. Why force something on those who can't use it? Also, 4(!) copies of the cover? Ok, it's a good cover, count 'em. The box, the booklet, the LP cover replica, and the buttons. Hey, don't knock the buttons. If I had a lapel, I would wear them like those who wear the flag. Oh, yea, the 4 fragments on the jewels boxes that you can rearrange into a schizoid vision of the schizoid man. The impact is even more intense in this day and age, as he is still the same after all these years, I honestly feel sorry for him now........Also, the history lesson on the CD and copyrights was ok, but if Fripp now has the masters of Wake, Islands and Larks, why were those 30th Anniv. issues so awful? Lark's Tougue was one of the worst ever. Those CDs have that really awful mismatch between the loud and quiet parts. The article made it seem like a big triumph, but it was not for the listener. I am not really looking forward to spending money like on this one just to get decent quality on those. So, I hope he does better next time around....

(think soundtrack from Indecent Proposal and \\"No Ordinary Love\\")<br /><br />This will be an album that grows on you and grows in importance in time.<br /><br />This music should appeal to the over and under 40 crowd.<br /><br />I hope I don't have to wait another 10 years, but I will for quality like this.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Finally! repackaged re-issue of \\"Battlestar Galactica (2004): The Complete Series\\" This version of The Complete Series also includes the unrated, extended feature-length movie, \\"Battlestar Galactica: The Plan.\\" the DVD will be in \\"Slim Snap Cases with an Outer Box\\" and the high-def Blu-ray version will be \\"Digipaks with an Outer Box\\".<br /><br />  I know a lot of fans were very disappointed and upset that the Complete series box set was bulky and the season boxes were cheap materials.  Also the fact the complete series was not \\"complete\\" as it did not include the last two hour movie.  Universal has made it a point to re-release the complete series on DVD and Blu-Ray to correct both these issues.<br /><br />I myself own the first Bulky \\"complete series\\" box set and I didn't mind it, although I agree it would have been nice to fit on my shelf.  So when I heard it was to be re-packaged, I was a bit irritated that I may have to re-purchase the set to get better packaging.<br /><br />if you check on [...] both sites have information on how current consumers can Mail in their information and have the new packaging sent to them for free!  I just mailed my information.  any consumers who currently own \\"the complete series\\" can receive this new packaging.  Anyone who sees this review I encourage to take this offer, especially if you don't like the current packaging.

B000JLQSWE|2.0|I appreciated the quick delivery, however the sound quality is not the best (the volume fades in and out). Regardless, it is still a good item at a good price.  I bought 3 CD's and 1 was great, the other 2, not so good and this was one of the 2.

B000P0J09W|4.0|This was not as bad as you remember ... it's a Who's Who of popular movies.      Kerri Green is still cute, Corey Feldman and Martha Plimpton are still irritating, Sean Astin is not yet a hobbit, and the \\"Tooz\\" never looked so good!  First movie for Josh Brolin.  The amazing Anne Ramsey and the Fratelli's are a stitch.    Yeah, the plot is weak.  The kids overact.  The timing is not great.  So turn off your brain and have some sophomoric fun!
0143171119|5.0|This classic became a worldwide bestseller and was turned into a successful movie starring Richard Burton as the British spy Alec Leamas (AL). It also enabled John Le Carré (JLC) to say farewell to the British Foreign Office and devote himself full time to writing. First published in 1963, this book has not really aged. JLC's books are about what Americans call HUMINT (human intelligence), with spies living under deep cover, determined to go unnoticed. In contrast to Ian Fleming's creation James Bond, JLC's heroes attach little importance to technology. For them no high living, casinos, amazing gadgets or crazy enemies planning to rule the world or steal the gold from Fort Knox. With one exception (\\"A Murder of Quality\\"), in JLC's novels in the 1960s and 1970s, the Cold War is the backdrop and the Soviets and their satellites, the enemy.  AL has been the Circus' West Berlin man for ten years, when his networks in East Germany are destroyed one by one by Mundt, who has quickly risen in East Berlin's intelligence apparatus after killing two of his own agents in London and managing his escape from the UK. AL returns to London empty handed, whereupon he is shelved in the Circus' banking section. This is the beginning of his life spiralling downward, or is he being brought back into play? Where people work with people, mistakes are made. AL meets assistant librarian Liz, who has been a Communist party member since 1954, and decides not to involve her in the legend being created around his person by Control and his staff, amongst whom George Smiley. The Circus is unaware of their affair...  Superlative writing, great characters, mounting tension, unexpected turns in the plot and a dramatic and cynical finale. It is a recipe for compulsive reading. JLC's oeuvre is eminently re-readable. Masterpiece.
B0011TMGKG|5.0|I remember the first time I heard Rachmaninoff's Prelude in G Minor and I imagine it's the same way kids feel when they leave the world of black and white panda toys or board books and come face to face with Logan the Lion.<br /><br />\\"This is what I'm talking about,\\" they must think, their eyes greedily devouring the bright red mane and the explosion of colors that stream away from it. \\"I don't know what those blue and green circles are called,\\" I imagine them saying, \\"but I'm going to eat them up--and that purple star too--even if it means I have to puke out a rainbow!\\"<br /><br />Logan the Lion is that good. He's a sensorial blast of different textures and bright colors. He's cheerful. And he's an unforgettable introduction to the wonderful world of colors. \\"That black and white stuff is OK,\\" they must think while raising Logan up in their hands, in sync with a rising smile, \\"but this is what life is all about.\\"
B001QOGYFO|2.0|What coulda been a contenda for a great thriller about nuclear material missing for over 60 years, turned out to be nothing more than a tired old mystery about valuable gems. The only saving grace was looking at Kate Beckinsale and seeing Tom Skerritt, two actors whose skills were wasted in a wasteland. The setting may have been novel but not the contrived story.<br />And let's get real, going out in 60 below (Centigrade or not) temps for longer than a minute is VERY dangerous!<br />It took four screenwriters to come up with this crap?<br />Unless you have 87 minutes to wile away or don't mind briefly seeing a hottie in her underwear, DO NOT buy, rent or steal this movie.

1591843162|5.0|Seth Godin's new book Linchpin is not about marketing. It is about work. Do you act as a cog in the machinery of business, or are you an artist that stand out and make things happen.    This book runs opposite to a lot of entrepreneurial startup books most notably E-Myth by Gerber, which instructs entrepreneurs to define jobs in a very detailed manner (thru job descriptions and systems) so as to be able to hire the lowest cost person for the position.    So who's right and who's wrong? I believe in both. Having beautiful (yes, beautiful is the word) systems in your organization keeps the chaos in focus relative the vision and objectives. It is the minimum, the starting point. What drives forward movements are starters, rebels, iconoclasts or in the words of Seth Godin, linchpins or artists.    If you want steady and normal growth, go ahead and create a machine and fill it with jobs. Make sure the rules are clear and go by the book.    If you want a crack at being Wildly Successful, hire the weirdos, the artists. People who see work as an opportunity to make a real difference. Bud do make sure there are systems and intentionally go beyond it.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|starts offas anadventure and turns into a redundant lecture. you will hate the fact that you were drawn into this book by the authors reputation and a fast start only to be &#34;sucker punched&#34; with a rotten ending.
B002XTXFU8|4.0|Everyone has heard of Charles Bronson.  Well, THAT Charles Bronson anyway, the title character here is definitely a far cry from the hardened film hero of the same name.  This Charlie Bronson was originally born Michael Peterson, who despite having a decent upbringing, grew up to be a criminal, and much, much more surprisingly.  Known as Britain's most notorious prisoner, Bronson manages to capture the ferocity of the man with tongue-in-cheek humor and sheer unpredictable moments.  Tom Hardy, who has been in quite a bit ranging from Star Trek: Nemesis, Layer Cake, and Rocknrolla among others, gives a star-making performance that should be seen to be believed.  Besides undergoing a physical transformation in bulking up, Hardy's performance may very well be akin to what Eric Bana managed to do some years ago with Chopper, in which he ironically enough, played famous prisoner Mark \\"Chopper\\" Read.  All in all, though it definitely isn't for everybody, Bronson is wholeheartedly worth your time, mainly thanks to the ferocious performance of Tom Hardy, whose stardom should most definitely (and deservedly) be on the rise.
B000UAE7RW|5.0|When trying to decide what release of Chinatown to buy, I was looking for reviews regarding the video quality of a particular release because some DVDs look like they were copied from VHS tapes.  Instead of finding the information I needed, I got \\"noir\\"ed to death.

B002RKSZWG|5.0|This was the first time I read this book.  I know it's a classic and all that, but I really enjoyed it.  It was a bit hard to get into right away, but once all the players were introduced I was hooked.  I was so nervous in the middle of the book because you really can't know who she's gonna end up with, if anyone!  It's a good read.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Being a Star Trek fan for many years, I was anxiously awaiting the release of this new addition.  I was not disappointed.  This is an excellent, action packed new look at a long time favorite series.  While some \\"expert\\" trekies have complained about some minor technical details, they are, in my opinion, just full of themselves.  This is a fun movie which does not disappoint.  The casting is excellent and the special effects are enjoyable.  Enjoy.

B0026NWBY2|3.0|Many years after EMI's disappointing \\"Best of George Harrison\\" (1976) and Warner's superior \\"Best of Dark Horse\\" (1989) comes a golden opportunity to compile all the Quiet Beatle's major and minor hits. Unfortunately, \\"Let It Roll\\" (2009) evades that simple task and omits several Harrison classics in the process: \\"Bangla Desh,\\" \\"You,\\" \\"Crackerbox Palace,\\" \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\" and (once again!) \\"This Song.\\" Instead, we get three Beatle compositions from \\"The Concert for Bangladesh\\"; album tracks from \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Brainwashed\\"; and one unheralded gem - a 1984 rendition of Bob Dylan's \\"I Don't Want to Do It.\\" This remastered collection cries out for an extra disc to accommodate the essential singles. More than ever, Harrison's solo work deserves a definitive overview.
B0019N95IK|4.0|This is not a review, more of a comment/observation.  This will by far, be the least difficult \\"Star Trek\\" series to transfer to Blu-Ray.  The show was the latest to air on television, combined with the fact it is already in widescreen (1.78:1 ratio).  Since the entire Original Series is out on Blu-Ray, logically the next series to be released on Blu-Ray would be \\"The Next Generation\\", however I wouldn't be surprised if this series is released on Blu-Ray before The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, or Voyager, due to the fact that those 3 series would need more clean-up and re-mastering.

B002QW7ALM|2.0|Pandorum starts off both well combining horror and suspense as Bower (Ben Foster) wakes from suspended animation aboard the spaceship Elysium. The affects of long-term suspended animation includes memory loss. We are thus faced with suspense as Bower attempts to remember where he is, and also, who he is.    The ships systems aren't working well and it seems he and (fellow crew-man) Peyton (Dennis Quaid) have another menace on-board; ravenous flesh-eating hunter-creatures.    The ship's cargo are thousands of people also in suspended animation - all hopefuls for a distant planet and a new start after the failure of earth to support life.    Along the way Bower meets passengers Manh (Cung Le) and Nadia (Antje Traue) both living against the odds against the hunter-creatures. Manh doesn't speak English. Bower must join with them to reach the engines to re-set them, or all the systems will fail.    Peyton stays behind in a commmand area to guide him but is soon met with a crazy crewman Gallo (Cam Gigandet) who may be suffering from Pandorum, a pychosis from space travel.    Then plot faults develop. Where the hunter-creatures come from is never explained. Nadia takes a guess, but that's it.    Why she nor Manh have ever attempted to revive any other passengers in order to gain help against them is never explained.    They meet up with Leland (Eddie Rouse) who somehow knows how the ship came to be in the state it is, and what happened to the three bridge crew even though there's no way he could know. He's also decided to survive by eating people.    The plot gets murkier and murkier as if they ran out of ideas on how to end the film.

0307269981|4.0|A thoroughly gripping and enjoyable book, nearly as good as the first, but not quite. I was fairly spellbound with the whole thing throughout, but must admit I found the ending slightly disappointing. It did not fully deliver what it had built up to throughout the narrative. Yet, Salander was once again deliciously typical and I truly savoured the read. Hence. A firm four stars.

I recently reviewed Sawdust Mountain by Eirik Johnson [[ASIN:1597110914 Eirik Johnson: Sawdust Mountain]] and as I reviewed that I realized that many of today's best photographers owe a debt to Robert Frank.  Buy this book and you'll see Franks' artistic descendants all over the place.
B0030MM68O|1.0|Wow... the writing and directing of this movie were way below par.  The scene where they are pinned down by the sniper is just ridiculous.

If however you don't like the setting for some reason or another you will not like this  book. The author tries to hard to have a plot twist every thirty seconds or so that can be quite frustrating at times. My suggestion is to go to barnes and noble and try to read the first 30 pages or so and if you like then buy it.

Speaking of Iraq, this movie was shot-in Jordan and looked exactly like what Iraq probably looks like (I've never been). I would like to meet a bomb tech one day and shake his hand. I bet he is one crazy S.O.B because you have to be to do that job.
B001NAZX6C|4.0|When I first heard it, I admitted I was a tad surprised by the style, although, after Achtung Baby (one of the best rock albums ever made) I guess this one could have been predicted. Due to all the electronics, it took me a while to settle into the album. However, listen after listen, it is clear there are really good songs on here and there is no denying the creativity and quality of the work. \\"Lemon\\" is my favorite and I like the extended edition on the album. To me, \\"Lemon\\" sums this album up. Bono, in an high operatic voice, electronic underbelly, sparse chorus, simple and elegant keyboard notes, and hypnotic melody- love the chorus- \\"midnight is where the day begins.\\"   Overall, this seemed a stage in U2, by now the biggest band in the world, continued to experiment and do what the heck they wanted and if you wanted to come along for the ride, so be it, if not, so be it. To me, it was the most cynical stage of U2 and the live show and even videos and this album had that aspect of it. They caricatured themselves, laughed at the \\"hype\\" rock bands get, all while giving the most over-the-top shows around.     Bottom line, it may not be everyone's favorite, but should be on everyone's shelf.
0545123267|3.0|I'm stumped!! And utterly baffled. I seriously do not know how to review this one. It's probably the hardest review I have written. When I was reading it I was uncertain what to rate it as. I really wanted to, give it 5 stars for it is a piece of art. A classic literature to me. The writing is beautiful, and the dialogue is the most realistic thing I have ever seen. I can imagine myself saying some of the things that were said. The emotion was dead on, and it was a beautiful story. If I were a director, I would certainly want to direct this movie. I can imagine it how it could be visually done. The characters were nicely put, and I could actually picture Olivia or Rachel as my best friend. I don't usually like two different POV's, in a story between the male and female lead, but it worked for Shiver. Even if there was no Grace or Sam (indicating point of view) on top of each new chapter, I could easily tell who was narrating. It worked beautifully! Maggie Stiefvater takes a realistic romance between two people and turns it into a believable supernatural tale. But I felt that if I gave it 5 stars, I would be lying to you. It is a piece of art, but it isn't my thing. Or I thought so, for 300 pages. Then by the ending, I started liking it. And I enjoyed it, and was eager to read Linger. Then the last page came, and it was ok. Could of been better, was a bit of downer after reading Finnikin of the Rock's ending. In the end, I decided to rate it 3 stars. I thought that was balanced. I originally was not going to rate it at all, then I was going to rate it 5 stars and now it 3. I think why I didn't like Shiver was it was too slow, had little action and too much romance. Usually when I read Paranormal/supernatural romance, it's balance. A little bit of the (insert creature your in love with) and a little bit of romance. 50/50 you would say. But this book was unbalance, and mainly romance. Too much of it for my taste. I mean it was pretty in terms of imagery, but just not me. Also it felt weird for a book to admit so quickly to what the supernatural thing was and having the female protagonist believe it so fast, and that unsettling on my tongue. But the love between Sam & Grace was real, how they acted and cared for each was truthfully. I thought it was a bit to fast at first, and a bit unbelievable that Grace's parents were that disconnected from her. I mean how do you not notice a boy sleeping in your teenager's room after a long period of time.<br />Sometimes I though Grace resembled Bella (Twilight) in some ways. Both were to clingy to there boyfriends, and both didn't really have lives after they left.<br />So in the end, Shiver was an amazing book that is fascinating in so many ways, but it was not my cup of tea. It took me through a roller coaster though. And if your wondering if I'll be reading Linger, well the answer to that is yes. I'm a sucker for series, and feel left out if I don't read all of them. Even if I didn't like there predecessor.e.

B000092T6M|5.0|I loved this movie when it was released. And having the two disc special edition makes it even better. The soundtrack is phenomenal. The bonus features are a lot of fun in their own right.
B000065VB0|4.0|Peter Gabriel's third album is quite the popular album... or at least USED to be quite the popular album.  Back in the early 80's a lot of people used to play this bad boy all the time.    \\"Intruder\\" contains quite the spooky and unsettling vocal melody, haha.  I love it.  Is that an xylophone in the middle?  Weird choice, but it works.  The lyrics that make you feel like you're being watched in your own home are just terrific.  Someone knows exactly where you are, but you can't see them.  A scary thought.    \\"No Self Control\\" is memorable for the chorus.  Peter sounds ticked off here.  \\"I Don't Remember\\" is probably the most dated song here, but I love the chorus so much I don't really care.  It jumps out to me immediately.  \\"Family Snapshot\\" is the best song on the album because it reminds me of Genesis during the Selling England by the Pound period in rock history when progressive rock was tearing up the charts... wait, DID prog rock tear up the charts?  I guess Rush, Kansas and Yes did.    The very end of \\"Family Snapshot\\" where Peter mentions his mom and dad makes me *incredibly* sad.  What a major reaction that moment sparks.  So soft, and the song just ends on a sad note, right down to the final piano note.  Oddly awesome.    \\"All Through the Wire\\" is definitely a bit repetitive.  I like it, but 5 minutes is a bit much.  \\"Games Without Frontiers\\" reminds me instantly of being a little kid in the 80's, and hearing Gabriel's vocals for the first time... man that guy used to creep me out, haha.  Good memories of my mom driving me to preschool with this tune crankin' though.    \\"Not One of Us\\" is a really good song too.  Gabriel certainly had his share of songs that should have gone straight to number one on the charts.  \\"Lead a Normal Life\\" is a weird choice.  It's almost an instrumental... almost.  There's an occasional slab of very pretty vocals that appear for a few seconds after 90 seconds in- very GOOD vocals.    \\"Biko\\" is a bit overrated, but I like the verse melody.    Overall, solid effort by a man who is now in the history books... or should be.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Vendetta was very passionate, with various mysterious puzzelments and shocking twists. A very bold movie, I loved it.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|In the movie, Gandhi began his work against the injustices of the British Empire when he was a young man in South Africa. After returning to India, Gandhi had convinced himself that he must get in touch with the masses and persuade them to follow him in nonviolent and non-cooperative protest against British Rule. Through marches, demonstrations, and protests, Gandhi was able to bring the attention of the world to India by displaying the violence of the British empire and not retaliating with violence. Although Indian Independence was Gandhi's main goal, he struggled with the idea that Hindus and Muslims did not want to live together after India had gained independence.   Gandhi was able to lead a highly effective march in South Africa, and his success caused him to return to India where he could work for an even greater cause, Indian Independence.  Gandhi died at a time when he wanted to achieve an end the hostility that the Hindus and Muslims had towards one another.     The \\"Mahatma\\" (Great Soul) as he was called by his followers. While traveling through South Africa, and being thrown off a train because of his race , until his death he led his people with hope and strong beliefs.  The British ruled the nation of India, and treated the citizens as second class. In this movie I realized Gandhi chose to be a better man.  In the movie the Hindu religion was depicted as a strong loyalty to ones beliefs. Religion was not only a belief but a way of life, not only something that is faith filled but makes up who you are. From the ways of what level of the cast system to the stages in which you follow throughout life. This shows that the Hindu religion requires strong will and devotion. After watching the movie the way of the Hindus was  beyond belief . Gandhi possessed such a strong devotion, faith filled belief in his way of life that was admiring. I was sorrowful for the violence  throughout the movie. Many lives that were lost and people that were injured and the greatest loss of all the death of Gandhi. Hindu religion was well portrayed in this movie it lead to a greater understanding of the Hindu religion and the \\"Mahatma\\" (Great Soul) Gandhi.
B00005B36H|5.0|This may very well be the most beautiful piece of contemporary musical artwork.  It is amazing, tender, touching, yet slightly painful.  While it is still inherently Tool, it isn't just Tool.  It is something more, something different than what they usually put out.  I cannot recommend this album enough.
B00004T9VY|5.0|It seems so inconsistent with Cat Stevens' beautiful, timeless message of peace, togetherness, and spiritual exploration to use hyperbolic language in describing his art, but I cannot think of a better way to phrase what I feel is true: that Tea for the Tillerman is the most gorgeous and poignant album of popular music ever recorded, and that the world at large would be terribly remiss to not actively celebrate it as such. Here are eleven tracks of sublime song singing and story telling, replete with a transcendent, heart wrenching appeal for harmony between all people that make it something of a manifesto on the modern human condition. I like to set aside an entire evening when I want to listen to this album, as the simple power of its music and lyrics invariably flood my mind with such profound and vivid thoughts and images of what it means to be a person with a soul in the world, with free will and self determination and so much art and culture at his fingertips, that I cannot help but attempt to create art of my own. In this way, in its inherent inspirational gravity, Tea for the Tillerman is a perfect work of art.    Unique among albums of popular music, each track is wonderful and meaningful in its own right, and each could facilitate an entire album around its musical style and broader philosophical message. \\"Where Do the Children Play\\" is a passionate, raw appeal for love in this world, for people to look outside of their own interests for just a moment and to consider what it means to be a part of a society: that our actions have consequences, and that we leave legacies; and that we do not inherit this world from our fathers, but borrow it from our children. When those first notes float from the speakers, one is immediately inundated with the passion of Stevens' appeal in this track.    \\"Hard Headed Woman\\" is a visceral appeal for love in this world, for genuine, meaningful romantic love, a love that is pure and lacks the self-conscious love of love that ischampioned by lesser popular music artists. This is a track about the human need for human contact, about the intense need that each of us has to be connected with another person. This is a song about symbiosis, and how the world has inexplicably commercialised love.    \\"Wild World\\" is the Cat Stevens song that everyone knows and immediately recognises, and this not necessarily a bad thing, as this track more so than any other here contains the essence of the album, and of Stevens' message at large: that the complexity and tumult of the world, and its effect on individual people can be overwhelming in a myriad of ways; that human emotions are subject to the tremendous inertia loosed upon us by the mind-boggling scale of our society, and that it is so, so easy to become lost. We are so beholden to the established ideology of the culture in which we persist that any sort of personal action is necessarily contingent upon the proper navigation through the staggering miasma of institutions and traditions, as well as to the physical challenges of living a meaningful life. This song is a bold underlining of the philosophy of \\"Tea for the Tillerman,\\" and a beautiful underlining at that.     \\"Sad Lisa\\" is a paean that celebrates the fact that human attachment can result in powerful and profound enough relationships that paeans are possible; it is an archetypical love song in numerous superficial ways, but it is complex and rich enough to transcend that label and be worthy of the Stevens name. The name of the song is something of a poem in and of itself in its halted iamb form and choice of the cliche \\"sad\\" instead of a \\"deeper\\" word: for in the world of Cat Stevens there is little more human than the simplicity and subsequent profundity of the human capacity to experience sadness.    \\"Miles From Nowhere,\\" is a powerfully introspective track about the relationship between the human spirit and the human body. While perhaps a tired notion in ad of itself, the way Stevens approaches this idea is unique: for him, and for us in turn, this relationship is a microcosm of the relationship that been sung about up to this point in the album: that is, the relationship between individual people and the society in which they live. The images of mountains and valleys described by Stevens here cannot help but summon up the grandeur and sublimity of nature experienced by the Romantic poets, and the pantheism it inspired in them. Here is a track from the heart of a man throughly invested in his own quest for spiritual peace. \\"I think I'll take my time to get there\\" may be the most beautiful lines in the entire album, and they beautifully anticipate the message of its following track.     \\"But I Might Die Tonight,\\" as its title suggests, is an affirmation of the profound psychological effect that necessarily follows an intellectual acceptance of one's mortality. Shorter than all but one other track on this album, the brevity of this song serves to facilitate its message that this life is short, far too short, and that we must, as the Romans would say, carpe diem. In a way, this is a transitional track, as the bent of the album moves from the introspective nature of the philosophy of its first half, to a second half focused on action. An affirmation of the brevity of this life, and the dichotomous nature of the human psyche, which needs thinking as well as doing to be fully realised.    If this album has a light track, then it is \\"Longer Boats,\\" a song in which Stevens expresses that he \\"don't want no gods\\" on his lawn, \\"just a flower.\\" In interviews (as well as in alternate versions of this track), Stevens has made it clear that this song is \\"about spaceships,\\" that the \\"longer boats\\" are alien spacecraft. This is a fascinating departure from the rest of the album on the surface, but upon consideration, it is actually not: for what better way to understand humanity than from without? That is, for the first half of this album, Stevens and the listener have been exploring the human condition together, side by side, a la Dante and Virgil. But what would all of this look like to an outsider, one of the helmsmen of the \\"longer boats\\"? As Stevens warns, \\"they're coming to win us.\\" Despite the sort of frightening undertones of this line, the pure excitement with which it is bellowed suggests a celebration of such an event. Perhaps it will take some outside intervention to bring people together, fully and finally.     In this vein, if \\"Longer Boats\\" is a fun song, \\"Into White\\" is a poetic track that again tackles the fleetingness of life. It does, so however, with clearly distinct intentions: this song is a poem that describes, with beautiful language, a specific scene, for the first (but not for the last) time in the album. Thus, the focus has turned from philosophy to culture: to what it looks like to be a part of this world, and that despite the intensity of it all, that there is beauty, and that the ultimate source of this beauty is simplicity. The \\"red legged chicken\\" of this track is perhaps something that the explorer from \\"Miles From Nowhere\\" has found in his quest to find himself, and as such, he has found beauty perhaps where he was least expecting: in a quiet domestic scene, where one can be with one's self and one's meditations. The poetry of the scene is captivating.     \\"On the Road to Find Out,\\" I must admit, is my favourite track on this album. This is a song that vociferously articulates the generally ineffable intensity of the human predisposition to travel and explore despite a superficially comfortable and meaningful existence. This is the song in which Stevens explains to the individual members of modern society that their inexplicable restlessness despite material success and the achievement of social expectations is a result of their humanity; that even though they may live in a \\"happy home,\\" they still need to get out and explore and find themselves, despite the odds. Here is the message from \\"WildWorld\\" being repeated, but also phrased slightly differently: for if \\"Wild World\\" is a track that suggests that the complexity of society makes spiritual exploration a daunting, awe-inspiring task, \\"On the Road to Find Out\\" is a track that suggests that this difficulty is a good thing; that nothing worth having is easily achieved, and that these sorts of experiences are what define us as individual parts of a global community. We must travel, we must explore to find what is in our minds, what is already there; it is a long and often painful journey, but it is desirous and necessary and wonderful, in the end, if we are willing to learn. This song is the narrative and philosophical complement to \\"Miles From Nowhere,\\" and the tiles of these two tracks together make something of a sentence that nearly sums up the general argument of the album on the whole: \\"[We may all be] Miles From Nowhere [right now, but, God willing, we are] On the Road to Find Out.\\" Here is the action to the thought; the Vitctorian to the Romantic sentiment.     \\"Father and Son,\\" is probably the most beautiful expression of the transient nature of humanity and the timeless message of the profundity of the relationship between successive generations ever recorded in popular music. This song catches the drift of the songs that have come before it here and puts it into the most meaningful and universal situation imaginable: the relationship between a father and his son. The father, defeated by this world, comfortable with his things (the message from \\"On the Road to Find Out to a tee; the son is clearly the singer of this previous track) explains to his son that, in the end, he shall settle down; that this is what people do. The son, tired of this lesson and the apparent investment that everyone around him inexplicably has in it, passionately sings \\"but it's them they know. Not me.\\" Here is the whole tragedy of humanity: that most of us are just passively receptive to the message seemingly lovingly delivered us by our forebears, and fail to explore ourselves, to get out own answers. And it is wholly irrelevant if we arrive at the same answers, for the beauty and necessity of this sort of exploration lies not in its conclusion, but in the journey itself; in our experience of the \\"wild World,\\" as we stand \\"Miles From Nowhere,\\" but are ever \\"On the Road to Find out.\\" Hopefully along the way we remember to ask ourselves \\"Where Do the Children Play,\\" and thus remember that there is so, so much more to this life than achieving material comfort. After all, we \\"Might Die Tonight,\\" and what will the goods mean then? This life is about personal spiritual exploration, regardless of what those in charge would like to make it seem what it is about.    The concluding track, \\"Tea for the Tillerman,\\" is a gay, ecstatic celebration, the only proper finish to any artistic project that actively engages the question of the human condition. For while the raw data may be depressing, and while there is suffering and misery and unjustness and preaching and prattling and a focus on materialism, \\"While the sinners sin, the children play\\" Stevens sings, beautifully, repeating this line to close out the album. \\"While the sinners sin, the children play, for this happy day, for this happy day.\\" This track is an exclamation mark at the end of this album, and turns from it a brooding, melancholy experiment to a piece of art that is pure joy; that is a celebration of humanism; that is a love song for everyone. For as long as a piece of art like this can exist, and as long as themes can be explored and these questions can be asked, then this life is worth celebrating.     I truly believe that Tea for the Tillerman is the most gorgeous and poignant album of popular music ever recorded, and that it is the most meaningful manifesto on the modern human condition ever articulated by a popular artist. Human beings owe it to themselves to take the thirty six minutes that it takes to hear this masterpiece, period. I cannot think of a more beautiful and perfect artistic achievement than this album, and though that may seem like easy praise and hyperbole, it is simply the best way I can conceive of to articulate my feelings toward this piece. If you are even a little bit lost, this piece will simultaneously tell you that it's perfectly fine to be lost, that, actually it's great to be lost; and that you must get out there and explore this world, regardless of how intimidating it is and how comfortable everyone tells you that you should be with all you have. Listen to Tea for the Tillerman and be a better, richer, and more genuine soul than you were before. Listen to Tea for the Tillerman and celebrate the dizzying wonder of humanity. Listen to Tea for the Tillerman and love a little bit more than you did before.    Listen to Tea for the Tillerman, and take its advice.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|About time we can now hear the Beatles music with clarity and precision. Outstanding job with packaging as well. I am hearing some things it seems like for the first time and I love it. I know that a large portion of the public prefer the mono Lp's with the first several albums and I am not here to argue that point. If you can afford to get the mono set as well then by all means you should do exactly that. Let me say this:  my 19 year old son is very much into music as well. He saw this box sittimg on the table in my room ( by the way he is not a big Beatles fan )and he said I am glad you got this. A couple of days later he came to me and said I was wanting to play one of those Beatles CD's which one do you want me to play? I said play \\" Revolver \\" so he did and under the headphones I might add. Next day I said what did you think of The Beatles you played last night? He said \\" Daddy I have never heard music sound like that before the switching speakers and stuff like that was awesome \\". Needless to say he is now finding The Beatles and it was thanks to this box and its superb sound.

B00338QENI|5.0|Couldn't resist this book. The author's persistence in developing a relationship with the Lacks family, especially Deborah, is admirable, and unlike other reviewers I feel it needed to be developed. The family had been subjected to press coverage that ultimately confused them and they had been victimized by a charlatan whose goal was to make money off them. The topic was totally engrossing and the impact the \\"cells\\" had on the family was absorbing. I don't feel that anything unethical was done considering the times. I'm glad, however, that we've moved forward toward \\"informed consent\\" although the ethical questions haven't been resolved to my satisfaction. Learning the extent to which blood samples, biopsies, etc., are stored for research was a little daunting. The timeline ended in 2001 and the book didn't make it into publication until 8-9 years later which is a shame. This book deserves a wider audience than I think it will reach.
B00275EGX8|5.0|Quite frankly, one of the best war movies I've ever seen. \\"The Hurt Locker\\" focuses on what it is to actually be addicted to war and the repercussions on those who not only crave it (through the character portrayed by Jeremy Renner), but those who are scared of it (Geraghty) and those who don't understand it (Mackie). Renner, who I've always thought to be a great actor starting with 2002's [[ASIN:B000A2X3MU Dahmer]] and 2003's [[ASIN:B00008EYA5 S.W.A.T. (Widescreen Special Edition)]], takes the lead in this drama as a rebel bomb squad technician who lives on the edge with every bomb he diffuses. An equally impressive Anthony Mackie ([[ASIN:B00005JPBO We Are Marshall (Widescreen Edition)]]) plays the spotter on his team, with Geraghty playing the assistant specialist.<br /><br />Most might brush this film off as just another war movie made by the liberal media. However, I believe it's anything but just that. What makes this one of the best war films I've seen is that it doesn't so much as focus on just the action as it does on the humanity itself as well as the psychological toll that comes with fighting a war in a country where anyone can -- and most likely will -- kill you. Add the constant unease of being in a job that is as dangerous as bomb diffusion (where every move might be your last) and it's no surprise to see the mental toll it takes on the three central characters. Each moment these guys go into the field, director Kathryn Bigelow easily conveys (with the help of Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders' on-edge score) the tense moments that fill any soldier's life during war.<br /><br />Bigelow deserved the Directors Guild Of America award for Best Director and the Oscar. The way this film was shot mostly had the feel of a documentary more than a major Hollywood motion picture. And that (along with using mostly slightly unknown actors) helped the believability of the story. I especially liked that the well-known actors used in the film were more like cameos and were not followed throughout the story (Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, Evangeline Lilly).<br /><br />For those who don't mind seeing films about war, this should be a must. For those who don't even like war films, you should still give it a try as I find it an essential viewing -- not just in cinema, but also for any film that truly encapsulates a post-9/11 world.throughout the story (Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, Evangeline Lilly).

Woody Harrelson proves yet again in this performance (and not just his Oscar-nominated role in \\"The Messenger\\") that he's a versatile actor and rocks in almost anything. Jesse Eisenberg has made amends for the so-so [[ASIN:B002BFBAWO Adventureland]] and Emma Stone ... well, she's always been great. She's one to keep an eye on; I think her acting will only get better and better. Abigail Breslin is cute ... but tough. And Bill Murray gets the award for Best Cameo Appearance in a Movie (ANY genre)!<br /><br />This is a fun movie ... despite the dread of knowing that most of the planet has been infected and turned to zombies. The script is fast-paced, sharp and witty. For anybody who enjoys zombie movies and comedies, this is for you. I even enjoyed it MUCH better than [[ASIN:B0006A9FKA Shaun of the Dead]].
B00006CXSS|3.0|I bought this for my husband and he rated it 5 star plus.  I'm very hard of hearing and need subtitles, even with my hearing aids, on most DVD's.  Band of Brothers only has Spanish subtitles, which are useless to me.  My lower rating of this DVD is because I have been unable to make out the dialog, which is so frustrating to those of us with hearing difficulties. I'm so surprised that an HBO production of such superior subject matter and quality of production would have no \\"English for the hearing impaired\\" subtitles.  Sadly, I will never have the opportunity of enjoying this DVD.
B003102JDM|4.0|As if they represent two halves of one soul, the Coen brothers definitely have a singular perspective on their films, and this richly idiosyncratic 2009 comedy feels like the most complete manifestation of their conjoined personas. An appreciation for Jewish culture would probably help in watching this film, but as someone who is only familiar with those traditions from late-night viewings of \\"Fiddler on the Roof\\" and \\"Yentl\\" on TV, I think the Coens manage to transcend the story's ethnic elements into an entertaining fable about fate and karma in suburban Minneapolis circa 1967, the same place and time when older brother Joel Coen would have been preparing for his bar mitzvah. That rite of passage is meticulously detailed with humor in this tale through bored adolescent Danny Gopnik, who would rather listen to the Jefferson Airplane through his transistor radio earplug.<br /><br />The movie starts unexpectedly in a shtetl somewhere in Eastern Europe back a century or so, when a poor man and his stoic wife are visited on a wintry night by a scholarly rabbi she knows had already died. When the mysterious man appears at their door, she stabs him to prove she's right, that he is a dybbuk, an undead spirit inhabiting the man's body. Flash forward to 1967 and we meet Larry Gopnik, a put-upon Jewish professor of physics surrounded by marijuana-smoking son Danny, constantly agitated daughter Sarah, thoroughly resigned wife Judith, and slovenly brother Arthur who refuses to leave the house as he works on some unwieldy numerological treatise. As Larry awaits approval of his tenure at the university, his life starts to fall apart piece by piece. Judith announces her intention to divorce him to marry their smarmy neighbor Sy Ableman, and he is forced to move to a nearby motel when she empties out their joint bank accounts.<br /><br />A Korean student named Clive insists the failing grade he received from Larry was unfair, and Larry then discovers an envelope with thousands of dollars inside. Pride overcomes temptation initially, but a series of unexpected events make the money more appear more desirable. To stave off his guilt and attempt to understand the root of his difficulties, Larry meets three distinctly different rabbis sequentially to sort out his troubles, but nothing seems to help.

B001GCUER0|5.0|ENJOYED SEASON TWO EVEN MORE THAN SEASON ONE.  HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGING ALL MY FRIENDS TO BUY THE DVD AND WATCH MAD MEN.   CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 3 TO COME OUT.
0316069906|5.0|This is the book that I want to give to all my meat-eating friends and beg them to read it!  In a well-written examination of what we eat and why, it examines the cultural, familial and societal ties that some have given to the meat industry.  It reads like a novel while weaving in a ton of information on factory farming and the way animals are treated.  There are many other books out there that recount the horrors of the meat industry, but I can't think of a single one that is as eloquent, touching, disturbing and informative as this one.  Read it and let it change you!
0385532458|5.0|This is another great John Grisham book, as usual he captures your imagination and keeps you reading.  I am enjoying this very much.  The format is unusual for him but very good read.
B000SMWUPS|1.0|I bought this thinking it would be easier than the city mini parent console for double strollers and I didn't want to spend the money. I should have just spent the $30 because this broke within the first month. It is made from cheap material and the straps are very weak. My strap broke and I wound up having to throw it away while we were on vacation so I had no cup holder. Save your money and don't bother with this product.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I LOVE this show!!  Great writing, great cast and having grown up in this era, it is very realistic, but also very entertaining.  Can't wait to see Season Two.

B002O4J4DO|5.0|Creedence was one of the top recording acts of the late 60s, with such classics as \\"Proud Mary\\", \\"Born on the Bayou\\", and \\"Fortunate Son\\". Now, newly remastered, we hear the band as it was during it's glory days. In addition, two tracks from their stint as the Golliwogs, are also included, as well as a short DVD of several of the band's promo clips. An essential collection for any fan of classic rock.
1428144552|5.0|First off let me say that is one of my most favorite books on CD, I believe there are a lot of truth in this book when it comes to visualization, postive thinking, giving, and focus.  Do I believe you can cure cancer with well-power or fix your own eyesight, NO!!!  I do believe that if you are ill, you must keep a postive look on life, because it does effect you immune system and if you lose the well to live you will die.  So keep positive.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|While I like the idea of this movie I have to say; it was very disappointing.  Pride & Prejudice is one of my all time favorite books and movies.  However, the writers take this way too far.  The characters are suddenly not at all like Austen wrote them.  I understand the outcomes would be different with this movie but I would imagine the characters should remain true to how they were originally written (and intended).  Instead you have Lizzie, who while is never seen, seems to think it completely acceptable to abandon her family and leave them to worry about her whereabouts.  Then there's Caroline Bingley who, as we all know, is after Darcy for marriage.  Spoiler alert here...What we might not have known is she is apparantly only interested in women but wants to marry Darcy because that's how it should be.  Not to mention that Georgiana is a brat who throws Wickham's name and character under the bus just to save her own skin because apparently he refused her advances and not the other way around.  And Darcy is just blind to it all...This is taking Jane Austen's work completely too far.  I wanted so badly to like this movie but I simply could not.  It had the chance, with good writing, to be quite good but instead it's a mockery of one of Jane Austen's most loved books.
0767020308|4.0|Love to have them both, but the other version of Emma with Paltrow is far better!!
B002OR18HQ|5.0|Taken from John Fogerty\\"s return to the Royal Albert Hall, this new DVD is a classic. Including inspired performances of his CCR and solo classics, it even has one new song performed especially for the concert: a rocking \\"Comin'Down The Road\\".
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Man, I bought this with the idea of reading it a chapter or two on the commute from and to work. I picked it up and could NOT put it down. I'm not quite finished with it tonight, but I will be in the morning. This is a well documented feeling book that at the same time has a wonderful narrative that reads like a novel. The stories are  wonderful and amazing. I was stationed in South Korea in my younger days, and picked up an interest in North Korea while I was there. This book does more to describe how people can follow \\"the leader\\" better than anything else I've read. If you are reading reviews you must be somewhat interested. If so you should so get this book!
0739368044|4.0|I loved the book!!! I wish it didn't take 2 plus years to publish the next book or that he would have kept to his original plan and finished at 3 books.  This is a great series but ready to have it over so he (Christopher Paolini) can get to another book or three.  He is a very good writer. He kept my attention and I don't generally like complicated series (ie WOT series I am still reading it but very annoyed). I will say I think the foreshadowing in this book and the previous 2 books  is very good and I think that even I caught it. All in all this is a very well written book and series I am very satisfied!
0140620753|4.0|The book and the story are pretty good, but Price and Prejudice will always be my favorite Jane Austen's book.
B00005ONMP|5.0|This is probably the last set of complete Mendelssohn Symphonies I'll buy.  Why, you ask?  Simply because this set is so good that I don't see the need to get another.  Abbado has a great sense of Mendelssohn's \\"sound\\", his tempos (actually \\"tempi\\" for real Italian speakers) are spot on, and the LSO responds to him perfectly.  Combine that with the fact that England was as good as Mendelssohn's second home during his lifetime, giving British orchestras a position of authenticity for Mendelssohn's music similar to the Wiener Philharmoniker's regarding Beethoven or Mozart, and I just don't see any need for me to spend money on another set that, after this one, would be surperfluous.
B002VZ4HMY|5.0|When I finished this book I hugged it and said, \\"good book! good book\\"! Dennis Lehane has produced another winning story.  Now, two years later, I am re reading it to see if there were clues I missed the first time.  I am so anxious to see the movie and can olny hope it packs the same wallop as the book.  More, Dennis, please.....
B000002GB9|5.0|Like a previous reviewer, I have just started listening to Styx.  I had always known about them but had not gotten into them due to other musical interests.  Now, with a lack of good music being put out anymore, I return more and more to 70s rock, expanding my collection.  I have to say, The Grand Illusion is outstanding, featuring 3 outstanding vocalists and many classic songs, along with former unknown album tracks that well compliment the singles. This is harder rocking than I had thought, through my previous years of resistance.  Though I had in years past much preferred Tommy Shaw over Dennis DeYoung, DeYoung's Grand Illusion in particular shows more of the rock influence that makes this a great album.  My personal favorite, though is Fooling Yourself, great contributions by all members are summed up in this song.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|2012 is so bad I can't even find words online to describe how idiotic it is. Unless your a 5 year old kid who has never blown up a Gi-joe with a firecracker, you shouldn't find this movie entertaining at all. The lack of imagination displayed in this movie is astounding, there are over 3 scenes where planes are taking off from runways with the runway crumbling behind them the entire time, 3 of them, its just stupid. There are also more than 3 scenes where a car is driving 50 mph with the ground crumbling at the rear wheels the entire time, how the ground crumbles behind your heels in this movie happens to many times to count over & over. What is the most annoying about this flick is the 30 or so \\"2 feet away from death\\" scenes. People in this movie escape from death by 2 feet every 5 minutes for the entire movie, its so ridiculous, After about the 5th one I got bored with the CGI. Bottom line is this movie just has no imagination at all, every scene is the same even though its different. I officially rename 2012 to \\"2 Feet away from Death\\", and I also advise people to NOT buy this movie & go to Shanghai instead, because not only do the Chinese build good doomsday ships like in the movie, the make perfect bootleg DVD's in real life. 2012 DVD in Shanghai $1.00 US
0767836286|5.0|What an amazing movie this was! Much better than I thought. The previews didnt give it justice as to how good it was. The ending messed me up though, I will just leave it at that!
B000BCE918|4.0|...But I will start with the positive points. For a great price, you get all 3 movies in the Jurassic Park trilogy. AND, on top of that, great bonus material for each movie. (These are single sided discs, and each disc contains a movie with it's corresponding bonus material.)     The sound and picture quality are great. The packaged set comes in a nice slipcover as pictured. Inside the slipcover is the boxed set which opens up and contains all 3 discs (you do NOT get separate cases for each movie). The box containing the discs has nice artwork both inside and out, but the discs themselves are plain - no background design, just the name of the movie, etc on the disc.    This would have been an enthusiastic 5 stars except that, as mentioned in my title, the movies I received are ALL full screen rather than widescreen. (I think it must be a manufacturer error, as even the discs themselves say \\"anamorphic widescreen.\\" I checked the settings to see if perhaps the movie came in BOTH full and widescreen, but not so.) Not a major issue, but still disappointing if, like me, you prefer widescreen...    Overall, though, this is a great deal. True, you miss out on a few of the frills you would get if you purchased each movie individually (such as individual cases/packaging and artwork); but you still get each movie, plus special features, plus a nicely packaged box to contain them all for a bargain. (I've noticed prices sometimes change on Amazon, so do the math and see if it is a good price per movie  for you, and enjoy!)
B002RKXO6S|5.0|Bon Jovi has always brought new music and themes in every CD they have created so far.   However, The Circle is by far one of the Best.  You have to get this CD, and don't forget to listen to \\"Working Man\\"   on the CD its amazing!!!!!

0061719544|4.0|I loved this bawdy and brave memoir, mostly because Ferguson writes well and dishes up his story with unflinching honesty.  Perhaps known best as an actor, stand-up comedian, and talk-show host, he manages to weave humor and humility into what otherwise might be one man's tragic story of self-destruction.  Raised in hardscrabble Glasgow, he grows up to begin a life of limited education, repeated job failures, alcoholism and drug abuse, massive debt, infidelity, broken relationships, and humiliating personal events.  He is sometimes unkind to others but mostly unkind to himself, chalking up bad choices on the board as if they were Brownie points.  Yet early on, at age 13, a seed of hope is planted--he father takes him on a brief visit to America and he became enthralled with it.  New York City, in particular, was a case of \\"love at first sight,\\" and Ferguson pledged to his father that he would live there someday.    But upon his return to Scotland, Ferguson starts his downward spiral in earnest.  Eventually, having hit rock bottom one too many times, he decides to commit suicide while in London by walking down to Tower Bridge and throwing himself into the murky Thames on Christmas Day.  Leaving his room over a pub, he had to pass by the bar.  His drinking companion of the night before was there and offered him a glass of sherry, a half-pint really, to toast the holiday.  \\"As the warmth spread through me as if from a thousand loving suns, I completely forgot about killing myself.\\"  Shortly thereafter, just before he turned 30, Ferguson got himself into rehab and has been clean and sober ever since.  It took him about six months to really achieve personal clarity, but once he did his fortunes started to take off.  Long story short, at age 32, he meets an old acquaintance who urges him to come to the United States in 1994 and offers to become his manager.  His breakthrough came when he played the character Mr. Wick on the Drew Carey Show from 1996 to 2003, and then in late 2004 he was picked to host The Late, Late Show.  His ratings have been competitive, and he is rumored to be in the running to replace David Letterman on The Late Show one day.  Ferguson is also a talented guy in other ways, having written and starred in three movies and authored two books (including this one).  He now has a child and is happily married to his third wife, for what he claims to be the absolutely final time.    So why become a citizen here?  \\"America gave me everything I have today.  It gave me a second chance at life.  Americans taught me failure was only something you went through on the way to success--it was a decision based on a belief in reason and fairness of opportunity.  [I'm] Scottish by birth, but American on purpose.\\"
0393075966|1.0|I bought this book because I really wanted to better understand all of the parts of the puzzle that is the housing bubble and its aftermath.  This book is a confusingly written politically motivated harangue against greedy bankers, enabled by rating agencies.  It basically absolves all of the other players.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to Stiglitz, just decided to \\"join in the fun\\" late in the game and were blameless.  He fails to mention that they were only partly \\"privatized\\" in that both enjoyed implicit credit guarantees of the US Government and that Congress declined to check them when they \\"joined in the fun\\".  Maybe the book got better, I was not able to finish it because the style of writing was rambling and confusing.
B00076RT24|3.0|So my girlfriend had me watch this movie for the first time since I saw it in the theatre, and I realize, it's actually not a bad sci-fi adventure flick.  It has an interesting premise, fun chase and combat scenes, and some interesting if underdeveloped characters.  The problem, I now see, is not that it's a poor film.  It's just a poor Star Wars film.<br /><br />The success of Star Wars Episode IV was in no small part its harkening back to the classic Flash Gordon serials of the 1940's and 50's.  This movie only harkens back to Star Wars.  It starts with no Act One and drops us into an ill-defined conflict, depending on our familiarity with the original trilogy to stay abreast of events.  It's confusing.<br /><br />More than that, it's unnecessary.  The point of this movie is to introduce Obi-Wan Kenobi to Anakin Skywalker.  The kid is the biggest drag on the film, always squealing and giggling like a punch-drunk teenybopper.  Everybody wants more of Darth Maul chasing the Jedi up and down the galaxy; that stuff is fun.  The kid just gets in the way.<br /><br />And the characters can be called mixed.  Though Qui-Gon Jinn is interesting, Jar-Jar Binks is inarguably one of the biggest miscalculations in movie history.  The other Jedi hang around dragging their heels.  And Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, potentially the most interesting new character, is wasted sitting in a beanbag chair, nodding like Solomon.<br /><br />If Lucas had started the prequel trilogy with Episode II, nothing important would be lost.  Of course, we'd miss the slick fight scenes where the Jedi and Darth Maul kicked each other up and down the galaxy, and that stuff is okay.  But we don't need it.  This is a fun sci-fi action movie.  But as a Star Wars film it's a wash.

068981528X|5.0|This book is particularly excellent, not only for its illustrations, but also for its originality in trying a new version of the timeless three little pigs. Instead of three pigs, we now have three sweet wolves and as the antagonist a big bad pig, very resourceful and dangerous in trying to enter their new homes, as they reinforce them with several security devices. Though I am not going to reveal the ending, I can just say that I found it original. As for the illustrations, they are wonderfully detailed and painted with great precision.<br /><br /> A great book to buy for the whole family. Even for adults.
B00000IL26|5.0|Ok. There was a free avant jazz insurrection going on in the 1960s. I have been privilaged to hear a good chunk of what Archie Shepp called [[ASIN:B000003N7M Fire Music]].<br /><br />That did not mean people forgot about good mainstreem jazz and the blues it rests on. Lee Morgan was one of the top envoys of this music, and Sidewinder is one of his best albums<br /><br />This is  simply creamy blues based hardbop with fantastic musicans and more than enough shuffle for 1000 feet. With this type of music, it is not the framework that is key--it is where the players go with it, and here, the soloing and backing work by all has amazing soul.<br /><br />I went to NYU in the late 1980s and got to see Barry Harris, panio player on Sidewinder, in a jazz appreciation class.<br /><br />I did not know who I was meeting and good for him. I probably would now drive the poor man insane asking him about Blue Note, Lee Morgan, the 1960s, and Sidewinder.
B002BWP4A6|4.0|I think it was back in November when I first saw a trailer for the Michael Haneke film Das Weisse Band (The White Ribbon). Initially the film appeared uninteresting but when I saw a trailer for it again in December I really paid attention to it and I thought to myself as soon as it opens up in Minneapolis, I will go see the film.<br /><br />I recently went to see The White Ribbon this month and I found myself constantly thinking about it after I left the theater. The time period of the film takes place just a year before World War I in a small German village. The village is plagued by a series of strange events that leads to human suffering. First the village's doctor is seriously injured when his horse trips over a thin wire. The doctor has to spend a lengthy time in the hospital. Another strange incident involves the baron's son who goes missing and is later found bound and tortured. A similar incident involving the midwife's mentally handicapped son occurs. Also a suicide, a barn burns down, and a young boy is restrained to his bed for admitting he self pleasuring himself happens through out the film. A lot of these strange events (not all though) somehow involves some of the children in the village led by the pastor's eldest daughter Klara.<br /><br />What makes this film so compelling and engaging is that the filmmaker does make this film a who done it? type of mystery but rather focus on human nature and just the levels of cruelty that some people (young and old) are willing to go. The one thing about the film that I didn't particularly care for was the narration. I could have easily done without that but I suppose if the film did not have the teacher's narration (when he is older) it would have left a void in the film. At times the film prodded a little too slowly but overall I enjoyed the film immensely.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is a happy movie that shows you love is all around us. I saw it in the theater and also watched it again on DVD. I like movies like these when I am feeling down. Fun to watch with your friend or your boyfriend because it is not a typical chick flick. Very cute ending.
B002ONC9NC|3.0|This was a difficult movie to rate. I thought the performances - especially Carey Mulligan's - and its 60s authenticity were outstanding. But the subject matter, despite being (purportedly) true, was not at my comfort level. It was unsavory, as another reviewer said. I kind of felt like I needed to take a shower afterwards, despite the fact that there was nothing sexually explicit in the movie.<br /><br />I found it unrealistic that Jenny's parents allowed her relationship to go on, even though Lynn Barber explained how this happened and how her parents were enamored with the sleazy David. (David, played charismatically by Peter Sarsgaard, is not nearly sleazy enough and certainly does not fit the description given by Barber).<br /><br />I suppose this could be labelled a \\"coming of age\\" movie, but it is one that I found rather bleak. As someone who is the same age as Barber, I cannot imagine anyone whom I knew in 1960 falling for this kind of seduction by a man twice her age. Nor did I ever know any parents who would have permitted such a thing this to go on. I almost hate to mention this, but I wonder how carefully Barber's memoir was vetted for authenticity? I am well-known by my friends for having a healthy skepticism about memoirs, and this one is no different. I just cannot help but wonder about the blurring of the line between memory and imagination.....

B001IYCMNA|5.0|Great WAP, I'm using it to extend the coverage provided by my Cisco WRVS4400n router.  Once upgraded to firmware 2.0.0.12 the interface is a snap to deal with.  The only configuration option I had an issue with was the AP Mode option to select.  I was under the impression that I should use the \\"Wireless Client/Repeater\\" mode, but that would not work with my router whatsoever.  A bit of research on the Cisco forums found another user who suggested using the \\"Wireless WDS Repeater\\" mode on the WAP and that worked like a charm.    One other issue, when using the Site Survey to find the wireless network to pair with my WAP would often lock up and then reboot on its own.  I finally gave up trying to use this option and simply typed the MAC address of my router in manually and the same for the WAP's MAC on the router and had no issues with their connecting with each other.  Obviously, make sure you match up the SSID and other security options on both the WAP and router or they will not connect to each other successfully.    Check out my review on the WRVS4400n v2 router if you're looking for a solid performing 802.11n gigabit ethernet router.
0545123267|2.0|I had wanted to read this book for a long time and I snapped it when I saw it in the library. But I was really disappointed.<br /><br />Firstly, I was kind of surprised that Grace fell in love with a wolf before even knowing that he could shift back to human. There is of course a reason for that but it was weird that she doesn't once question her obsession with the wolf. When she finally comes to know that the wolf is a human, Sam, she falls in love with him too and then she doesn't want him to go back to being a wolf. Kind of makes sense but still a little weird.<br /><br />Sam turns into a wolf in winters and he afraid that after some time he is going to remain a wolf forever. He has to find a way to stay with Grace forever.<br /><br />While I liked the concept I didn't like the execution so much. It was very long winded with the same things repeating over and over again. It was Sam trying not to turn and Grace wondering why she cannot change. The atmosphere the author created in Mercy Falls was great, I could imagine myself being there and starring at the wolf's roaming through the woods. But other than that there was nothing much. The writing at times felt a little juvenile. So I guess teenagers would really like this book because it also has that pining for first love feeling.<br /><br />If you love YA, go for it, else skip it.
0790729407|4.0|Michael Collins proves conclusive that  that Liam Neeson can play almost any role and make it his own.    Steven Rey also gives a first rate performance in his composite role of Ned Broy.  Julia Roberts has taken some heat for her role but it was not, in my opinion central to the movie. Alan Rickman plays an unsympathetic Eamon de Valera (does he EVER get to play a sympathetic character?) in fact it's reaching the point were he plays almost every character as the a pseudo version of Alan Rickman.    The picture itself is epic and beautiful it seems to emphasize the dark, this is very proper since it is a dark tale of a tough time of struggle violence and murder.    The tone and the color of the movie subtlety changes when it seems peace has come but starts to change back as the Irish civil war breaks out and it reverts back to the same tough time of violence and murder but directed even more by the Irish against the Irish.    The story here is more Collins than Ireland's so he is the protagonist and is made so. One can debate how much history there is in it but to critique it for being so is not really proper.    It is certainly a fine picture and worth your time.
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|I loved the first \\"Elizabeth\\" with Cate Blanchett, and so was eager to see the follow-up.    It doesn't compare.    It is gorgeous in design and costumes.  For the most part the acting is good.  But the plot and the writing are stiff.    Everything is a set piece.  People simply pose, deliver their lines, and swirl away.  This makes the movie curiously static.    There isn't much interaction between characters.  This becomes blatant with Clive Owen.  I have heard Owen declare in an interview that actors don't have to show \\"emotion.\\"  Well, in this one, he certainly doesn't.  He has two expressions: Amused in a Superior Way, and Sternly Serious.  These get old fast, and contribute nothing.  Owen is a kinetic actor like Tom Cruise, and when he is not in motion he is dull, almost embarrassing.    Geoffrey Rush is also wasted in this one.  He puts in his cameos and vanishes.    Worst of all, the plot jigsaw never fits together.  There is a vague suspense theme, involving Mary Stuart and Phillip II, but it is so un-suspenseful that it hardly makes sense.  There is even a suspense underplot, involving the Walsingham brothers, but again, it is limp to the point of sleepy.    The movie ends up feeling like a series of glamorous stills.

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|ohmigawd Gaga officially made the best album even of this year so far! i love the fame monster, all the songs are gold, except for the mad misstep of \\":Teeth:\\" which I hate with a passion! At first my fave was \\":Alejandro:\\" which reminded me of Madonnas La Isla Bonita, and then it changed to \\":So HAppy I Could Die:\\" which has a fresh sound and is so Gag but so relaltable, now my fave is \\":Speechless:\\" I love the old timey sound to it, like it belongs on vinyl... definite classic. i reccomend to anyone!

B000MRAAJM|5.0|The BBC is far superior to any other television production unit, in this case treating the viewer to an intelligent, cogent and comprehensive overview of the natural world which surrounds us. The photography is peerless, taking away the viewers' breath as it mounts the highest peaks, details the deepest oceans, lovingly records scenes from the planet we call home.     The discs will long be an integral part of your DVD discothèque, brought out to renew your spirits, not just used to teach children, enthrall them with the bounty of their home planet, show them what television is capable of.     This is the true reality series, not those sad hours of watching pseudo-humans. It is worth waiting for your Blu-Ray player and big-screen HDTV to be installed - absolutely spellbinding.

0156035294|5.0|A great book by Perez-Reverte, and made into a terrible movie called the Ninth Gate.  The book concerns a book dealer/detective who finds rare books for wealthy clients.  A job leads him to a group who collects the chapters of what was a serial, the Three Musketeers, and on the trail of an evil book wanted by a group of devil worshipers.  A bit of a detective story with literary history thrown in, and some interesting characters, set throughout Europe.  Like most of Perez-Reverte's works, a very enjoyable read.

1572814349|5.0|When we had a writer's workshop, a lot of different cards were put out for us to look at....angel cards, animal cards, etc.  I wanted the cards that were pretty, had a lot of depth in them, looked more like Renaissance paintings and were most like the original designs. We were told that Tarot came from the Italian game of Tarocci that was created to amuse the Italian court and were used for story telling, which is what mine are going to be used for, to break through walls of writer's block and spark new ideas. I'm delighted with how lovely these cards are.
B001TH16DI|3.0|I bought the DVD special editions a few years ago and LOVED the first movie.  This blu ray set really lacks.  The set i bought on DVD which is now discontinued is the best.  I would wait a while for the special editions.  I bought this and took it back.
0385504225|1.0|Few would argue that Dan Brown is a good writer.  His prose rarely rises above High School level, and he never met a cliche he didn't love.  He constantly inflicts long information dumps on the reader, either through narrative exposition or dialogue.  And his dialogue is laughable; just try reading it aloud--no one ever has or ever will talk like that.  His characters, especially Langdon, hardly ever rise to the two-dimensional level.  Finally, he writes the same novel over and over: Langdon and a female companion are racing through a big city attempting to forestall some terrible disaster and doing battle with a weird adversary.    Still, despite all that, he does manage to create page turners: ANGELS AND DEMONS and THE DA VINCI CODE were hard to put down.    But not THE LOST SYMBOL.  I found myself slogging through this book, wanting it to end, counting how many pages I still had to go.  I found nothing remotely interesting about the plot or the characters.  And boy was the climax a disappointment.  I won't give it away, but the thing that the CIA was desperately trying to prevent happening would not have been a big deal at all if it had happened.  Everyone could have spared themselves the trouble.    I can forgive Brown's poor writing if he keeps me entertained, as he did in his other books.  But I cannot forgive him for boring me to tears.
0446607274|5.0|I really enjoy the whole Harry Bosch character, he is seriously flawed and you probably wouldn't want to hang out with him, but if you need someone to help you out of a jam, he is your man.  I don't know how Connelly keeps coming up with these but I'm glad he does.
1592402690|2.0|Well, that's the impression you'll get after reading \\"Here, There and Everywhere.\\" Along with that, you'll discover that George Harrison was a \\"ham-fisted\\" guitar player, while McCartney was a veritable musical prodigy who could play everything from the bass guitar to God knows what.    You'll also discover things that are presented as facts but are completely incorrect. For example, Geoff tells us that the initial mix of \\"Penny Lane\\" omitted the piccolo trumpet flourish at the end, but was soon corrected and found its way onto the standard issue. This is backwards - the trumpet at the end was left off the commercial releases and is only found on DJ copies of the song.     Also, in George Martin's book \\"All You Need is Ears,\\" Martin explains how HE arrived at the solution of joining the two different takes of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and having them match perfectly by slowing down one and speeding up the other. Geoff takes credit for this in the book. Maybe George got it wrong. Who knows. I found myself encountering items like this throughout the book.    On the plus side, there are some interesting anecdotes that will please even the most die hard Beatle fan, but you begin to wonder how accurate they are.     This book leaves you with the idea that Emerick's hat size grew exponentially throughout his career at EMI, and wondering why his photo wasn't included in all of the Beatle's albums.

B002MW50KO|4.0|Many of the people who at first hated this have changed their minds. I loved it  from its opening notes, and I bet it outlasts Together Through Life (and Modern Times?).  Read Peter Doggett's fond, nuanced defence, \\"Sweet and Sour Turkey\\".  Christmas In the Heart is not awful, insipid (?), or drek (sic), to choose some of the  adjectives in the reviews; his voice is not \\"inappropriate\\" (how I hate that  school marm word of the 2000s), and it is not a joke.  It is an odd, quite beautiful,  often funny, joyous addition to the Dylan catalogue. While his voice may prevent it from  being universally embraced, I do think it will join the canon of essential Christmas  records.
B0000AUHQT|1.0|The Great Gatsby is a colorful, funny, panoramic book full of penetrating individual character studies and strong opinions about the lives of the wealthy.  This movie version doesn't communicate any of the book's depth.  The director focuses the movie on Gatsby's and Daisy's brief romance. It is the main focus of the movie. But in the book, their 'romance' is a minor point. It doesn't occupy many pages at all. In fact, one interpretation of the book is that Daisy doesn't truly love Gatsby. Rather, he's just another plaything for this bored rich woman, one that allows her to get even with her brutal husband's affair that he flaunts in front of her before Gatsby shows up.   The actors in the movie don't fit the characterization of the book. Bruce Dern portrays Tom Buchanan as weak. Fitzgerald shows Buchanan as a physically imposing, 6'3\\", 220ib college football star, who turns every encounter into a contest, a contest he intends to win. Dern doesn't show Buchanan's sheer intimidation. Robert Redford is OK as Gatsby, but it's not a hard role, because there isn't much depth to Gatsby. The interesting characters in the book are Tom & Daisy Buchanan and Jordan. Mia Farrow portrays Daisy as weak, unstable and easily upset. Fitzgerald shows Daisy as uninterested, confident and manipulative of situations.    This movie is a bust, but it's also 35yrs old. I hope a talented director and screenwriter see the opportunity for a new film interpretation about this magnificent book.   -  For film buffs, this movie is interesting in that it's a big money movie. Gatsby is released around the same time as Scorsese's & DeNiro's masterpieces of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull.  Those two geniuses to take Jake LaMotta's autobiography, and turn it into a cinematic masterpiece, one that is the forerunner of how films were made for the next couple decades. At the same time, Jack Clayton takes a masterpiece of a novel about dreams and wealth and ambition, the Great Gatsby, and removes all the interesting aspects of the book, and hands us only a tepid love story.  It's movies like Gatsby that show what a genius Scorsese is, because he takes everyday material and spins gold.
0793542049|5.0|I am a guitarist of many years who has started dabbling in playing bass (out of curiosity and recording necessity) and this book is just perfect for improving my bass fundamentals and my ear for harmony. No special knowledge theoretical is required going in, Friedland explains everything you need to know in the introduction, although approaching it knowing a LITTLE bit of theory (like intervals and the circle of fifths) will make it easier to process the examples.     Aside from some brief explanations at the start of each section, this book is almost entirely applied exercises, and they are paced very nicely for a beginning-intermediate player, and the play-along CD is very nice.    For those reviewers who are complaining about the lack of tabs in this book, it's true, there are no tabs, but it is a great way to practice sight reading on the bass clef in a gently-paced fashion; you just have to WANT to learn.
0143034901|4.0|For beginners, this book is stupendous and unpretentious (except for Fermin, who sports the best dialogue in the novel).  Every word is an adventure as the story unfolds, with intrigue and mystery and infatuation.  The story mostly takes place in Barcelona, Spain during General Franco's fascist reign.  There is a Fumero in this story who behaves like Stalin would have, tho he is a policeman, not a national dictator.  There is love and wonder and backstory that continually widens the scope of the overall tale.  Love this book, I do.  Recommend it to all.  And it's only a first novel.  Tho so was 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' by Ken Kesey. This work is more mysterious, however.
142313494X|5.0|The Lightning Thief is the first book in the Percy Jackson series, authored by Rick Riordan. I first learned of this book while attending a book festival about middle grade fiction for children, where Riordan was speaking (the Rabbit Hill Festival of Literature in Westport, CT). My interest was piqued when he said the idea came from the idea of viewing a child with a learning disability or a neurological condition (i.e. ADD or ADHD) not just as a child with a problem but as a child with other unique abilities thanks to the presence of their condition. The idea that a child may be different and superior in a good way in some areas while not normal in other areas (by someone's definition) is a paradigm shift. Riordan said he created these stories originally as bedtime stories for his son and it was his son who suggested he write them down. And so the Percy Jackson series was born.<br /><br />Percy Jackson is in middle school and struggles to learn. He doesn't have the high self-esteem and often feels that he's different and an oddball at school, he doesn't seem to fit in. He has never known his biological father, and his stepfather is verbally and physically abusive and spends a lot of time gambling and drinking beer.<br /><br />The story starts off with a bang and gets right into the action, with Percy soon discovering that he is only half human, because his father is one of the Greek Gods! Yes, Percy is a Demi-God! Unbeknownst to Americans, the Greek Gods are alive and well and living in the United States of America. Percy is sent to a summer camp filled with kids who are also Demi-Gods. Percy spends his summer on a quest and in the process learns that his weaknesses in the mortal world are strengths to him when living as a Demi-God, they give him his powers, help others and even can save his own life. Percy also finds true friendship that summer.<br /><br />The Lightning Thief book is a page-turner, action-packed story. I wanted to know what happened next and stayed up late at night to keep reading in order to find out. Riordan did a great job with keeping the pace of the book fast enough to move the reader along and not want to stop reading yet still manages to weave a good story in between (unlike the writers of most action movies who over-concentrate on the action and special effects). Riordan ends each chapter leaving the reader not wanting to put the book down--we want to plunge into the next chapter, and the next, and the next.<br /><br />After I heard Riordan speak and before I read it myself, I found out that The Lightning Thief has a reputation among parents, teachers, and librarians as being a book that appeals to reluctant readers. It is very much a book with appeal for boys but also some girls I have spoken to said they love the book as well. One of the secondary characters is a powerful girl which probably helps. In my area some public schools require all fifth grade readers to read this book so some girls I've spoken to were only reading it as they were being forced to, but they still enjoyed the read.<br /><br />The only kids I've spoken to who said \\"it's okay\\" instead of \\"I love it\\" are those who knew nothing of Greek mythology and were a bit lost, they told me, and they were being forced to read the book by their school teacher so they had to keep reading it. (I like to ask kids about what they think of the books I see them reading so I hear some very interesting insights.) Every child who already knows something about Greek mythology (especially the homeschooled kids who studied that in elementary history lessons) absolutely love the book. In Riordan's defense, as an adult reader I felt he gave enough of a brief description of each Greek mythology thing so the reader could keep up with the story. I have a feeling those who know more about it from prior learning are able to enjoy The Lightning Thief more (rather than the fault being something connected to Riordan's writing itself, the deficit is with the child due to their ignorance).<br /><br />My nine year old son recently read this and begged me to read it. He wanted me to enjoy reading it as he did, so I did read it. Then he compelled his twelve year old brother to read it; he loved it also and found it a page-turner too.<br /><br />If the child loves The Lightning Thief they can't wait to read the rest of the series and often dive right in and consume those also. At present there are five books in total. A movie has been made of this book which premieres this weekend (I've not seen it yet).<br /><br />The only controversial thing that one parent complained to me about was in The Lightning Thief she felt there was too much discussion on infidelity of married people and affairs resulting in babies being conceived, she thought that was too mature a topic for readers aged 9-12. Also she was upset about the abusive stepfather and felt it was unnecessary. She did say when she read the second and third books they were more tame. An additional concern of hers is that some parents were reading this aloud to children under nine years old.<br /><br />I love this book as an action packed read for children. It is great for kids who are not yet convinced that books are fun and that reading can be for pleasure reading not just being done for schoolwork. If this book can help a reluctant reader see the light that books and reading are great then I think Riordan has done a commendable thing for children by creating this book series.<br /><br />I do not recommend this as a read-aloud for children under nine years old. I feel this book is best used as an independent read to help lure in reluctant readers and to show all children who read it that reading is indeed a worthwhile, fun way to spend their time. I say let the child dive into the book by themselves so they can feel that wonderful 'escape reading' feeling and the pull of wanting to go on and on reading it, not wanting to put it down. Parents please allow your child that experience and pick something else for a family read-aloud (such as the full Chronicles of Narnia series by C.S. Lewis).<br /><br />I rate this book 5 stars = I Love It.year old son recently read this and begged me to read it. He wanted me to enjoy reading it as he did, so I did read it.

0385737424|4.0|When You Reach Me is an intricate, well-written mystery, with elements of sci-fi, time travel and nostalgia present throughout. It didn't grab me right from the beginning, but if I could find a way to bottle the last twenty pages and make everyone I know read them, I would. It has one of those perfect endings that feels like a light has been switched on in your head, and makes you immediately go back over all the little details that didn't register the first time.    Miranda, along with her family and friends, are exactly the kind of people I love reading about. They're by no means flawless, but they recognise those flaws and try to better themselves. They're nothing out of the ordinary, nothing special, yet they're all witness to an extraordinary series of events taking place right in front of their eyes.    As previously mentioned, the start of the story didn't grab me, and I was a good sixty or seventy pages in before I reached the point where I couldn't bear to put it down. It's a short book as it is, so I expected to be completely gripped quite quickly. Luckily, things got a lot better from then on, and I found myself enthralled by the Laughing Man, the crypic notes and all the talk of time travel.    As per usual, I had my own personal theories about what was going on, and none of them were right. I think I'm going to give up guessing, as it never works, and the authors are always cleverer than me when it comes to their imaginations. Rebecca Stead is no exception, and the end of When You Reach Me was absolutely brilliant. I can't wait to read the whole thing again, and pay more attention as I go along. Everything is relevant, and everything fits. I just have to piece it all together.
0060930349|5.0|I just finished watching C-Span Book TV's two hour session with the fascinating author Paul Johnson. It seems he is what I have been looking for for a long time. I have lately considered reading up on George Washington but was unsure of the author I should choose. Well it seems the heavenly father directed me to watch C-Span this morning and find my way to the right author. It was the best two hours I have spent watching the tv in a very long time, oh apart from the Olympic Opening ceremony.   Paul Johnson is one of those rare people that can lead an army of keen readers. I have not even read one of his books yet, but after listening to his long winded answers to many questions about history and current events I know this is the guy for me. Mastery just oozes from this wonderful man who the heavenly father has gifted with so much knowledge. He has the complete set of the Oxford English dictionary (20 volumes) and uses in constantly, at arms length.   Thank you Mr Johnson for being on C-Span this morning,(though it was taped) and thank you for being a knowledgeable author of history, I am zealously anticipating the arrival of your books to my mailbox.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Being a Sherlock Holmes fan for nearly two decades now, I've read every one of Doyle's stories and have seen a ton of different versions of Holmes and Watson.  Basil Rathbone was far too stiff, Nigel Bruce far too idiotic.  A few other actors were entertaining but didn't quite meet up to task (though Peter Cushing took hold of my heart for writing on his cuff - So very Holmes, that!).  Jeremy Brett has always been my all time favorite portrayer of the role... until now.      Downey's Holmes and Law's Watson are flawless, especially when you consider that all the Holmes stories except for two are written from Watson's point of view.  (Seriously, people, if you were writing about your best friend, would you tell them EVERYTHING about them?  Or would you couch your words to be as gentle, if honest, as possible?)  The Holmes in this film is the Holmes in the stories: a drug addict, a recluse until something catches his attention, suspicious of women (his behavior towards both Irene Adler and Mary Morstan reflects this), an expert fighter, deliberately \\"forgetful\\" when it's to his advantage, manipulative, impulsive, and extremely irritating but, at the same time, devoutly loyal to his friends, even if he may taunt them mercilessly.  Equally, we see the Watson as he was written in the stories: organized, caring, intelligent (something often neglected in other films), patient (with Holmes, you really have to be) but only to a point, and most importantly loyal.  The line in the movie that best describes Holmes and Watson is \\"Brother not in blood but in bond\\" and that is what you get with this movie.    I can absolutely guarantee this is one DVD that is going to get played a TON!
0393320928|5.0|Wit,humor and scientific inquiry are all included in this book. \\"What do you care what other people think\\", is a sequel to [[ASIN:0393316041 Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (Adventures of a Curious Character)]] and contains some of the most intriguing details of the great Nobel Prize physics winner and his early life. Within the context of the book you will discover what inspired Feynmans love for science as a young boy, as well as his relationships that incurred with women, or more particularly Arlene. Various letters between Arlene and Richard as well as Richard and Gwenyth(Feynmans second wife) are shown as well.  Within the midst of the book is a chapter devoted to images of Feynman at various places. Similarly, drawings in which Feynman drew are included which are all very well done. The second half of the book is devoted to Feynman at the Rogers Commission, If you have no interest in Feynman, but interested in the Challenger disaster of 1986, this book is recommended. Feynman gives a thorough insight on what occurred and what caused the disaster. Incisive figures are shown to give the reader an understanding of the shuttle and parts within. Many of the commission members will be understood through this book, many of whom are some interesting characters. Nevertheless, Feynman provides an in depth investigation of the O-Ring that ruptured off the Solid Rocket Booster as well as an investigation of Avionics,The Main Engine and many other parts of the shuttle. Many important facts are mentioned here regarding the shuttle, in which you don't want to miss! Ultimately, Feynman provides you with an appendix which was his report in the commission report. Also within the book is a lecture entitled \\"The value of science\\", this may very well be my favorite part of the book. It contains Feynmans views on the importance of science as well as the important outcomes that many tend to neglect. I HIGHLY recommend this book to all readers, whether it be one desiring a romantic novel, you will find it here. The same applies to those hoping to understand Feynman or one who hope to understand NASA and the Challenger Disaster, I can assure you, you will find it here.
1400052173|5.0|This is without question the best non-fiction book I've read in years. Skloot's debut is thrilling, original and refuses to be shoehorned into anything as trivial as a genre. Equal parts popular science, historical biography and detective novel, it reads as evocatively as any work of fiction.     Skloot repeatedly appears as a character in her own book, narrating her journey from first hearing about HeLa cells in a classroom to her attempts to contact and support the Lacks family. Her narration reveals the trials that the Lacks family have undergone since Henrietta's cells went global, and the sheer amount of trust it took to uncover the details of this story.   But this is really a book about three heroines - the two whose names grace the cover and Henrietta's daughter, Deborah Lacks. Skloot's personal mission to tell this story and Deborah's quest to know about her mother's life and legacy are central parts of Henrietta's story and they form some of the book's most compelling segments.     I write this review as someone who isn't typically a fan of historical non-fiction. Particularly in popular science, I often find descriptions of researchers to be distracting attempts at shoehorning in a human element that is out of keeping with the rest of the book. Not so here - this work has the most human of stories at its core, and never deviates from that important, and often heartbreaking, humanity. When science appears, it does so effortlessly, with explanations of cell anatomy or techniques like \\"fluorescence in situ hybridization\\" seamlessly worked into descriptions of the coloured wards of Johns Hopkins hospital to Lacks's hometown of Clover, Virginia.     Skloot's prose is witty, lyrical, economical and authoritative. But The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is not a comfortable read. Learning about Henrietta's devastating radiation treatments, the history of experiments on black Americans and the events in the book's conclusion are heart-rending. But the story is uplifting too, particularly in a stand-out chapter where Henrietta's children, Deborah and Zakariyya, visit a cancer researcher to see their mother's cells under a microscope.     All of this is to be expected of a book that refuses to shy away from tackling important themes - the interplay between science and ethics, the question of who owns our bodies, and the history of racism in the US. Actually considering these issues seems to be too much for some people, like the anonymous reviewer who appears to be attacking a straw-man version of the book. Those who actually make the effort to read the book and heart the story will be rewarded for it.     For all its grand scope, skilful writing and touching compassion, there is one simple element that makes The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks an instant classic - this is one of those stories that genuinely needed to be told. By right, it will achieve the same immortal status as the cells it describes.
B002DMJLTE|5.0|This really is one of the best movies made due to its human character development.  Additionally, the science and the human/techno response to the problem is not that far off at all.    It really is a great movie.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|Star Trek is very difficult to review, as it is on its own merits an excellent movie.  Very entertaining, good action, great characters, and is one of those great summer movies.  As such, I highly recommend it to movie goers.  However, as a star trek fan there's quite a few issues.  For instance (spoilers) has there ever been a star trek story where the plot involved someone going back in time and negatively altering history, where the crew didn't go back in time to fix it?  I mean, First Contact, City on the Edge of Forever, Yesterday's enterprise, the list goes on and on.  Here, they destroy the whole vulcan world, and decide just to stay in this altered timeline?  (END SPOILERS)  Also, the characters in some cases are very different.  Scotty wasn't really a silly crazy guy, but a respectable officer, and very capable.  Others are slightly different, but that's most likely a result of age, not the performances.  As such, the movie is very well made, but feels less like a star trek, and more like a great sci-fi movie.  I very much recommend watching this movie, but note that if you're a long time star trek fan, you're going to have some issues with it.
0006716776|5.0|This is the loveliest edition of this book that we've owned. It is of higher quality than other editions. The weight and gloss of the paper and the font of the text combine subtly to make this edition exceptionally magical.
B002NPCSJG|3.0|I tried to like this book. The premise is interesting and held my interest for a while. I wanted to see where it was going. But the writing constantly reminded me that I was reading a story by an author--I never lost myself in the book--and ultimately I stopped reading. Never finished it. Its not that the ideas ran out, but rather than the prose was a bit predictable and distant.

B002I6251G|1.0|When I first heard of The Editors, the name struck me as rather insipid -- why not just call yourselves The Publicists or The Consultants? How about The Behind the Scenes Advisory Committee? I have since come to the realization that there are just too many bands on Earth, as I later learned there was a short-lived outfit from Connecticut in the 1980s named Editors that also \\"idolized and imitated ... post punk bands like ... Joy Division.\\" And there was a late-'70s heavy metal band from Slovakia called Editor. I don't even know what god they pray to in Slovakia.<br /><br />In any case, I have a feeling both antecedents were livelier affairs than these mega-droll trolls from Manchester, England. The Editors' third release, \\"In This Light and on This Evening,\\" is an excessively limp affair in which, after a dozen or so attempts at giving it my full attention, my mind begins to conjure up visions of goth hacks She Wants Revenge covering Burl Ives.<br /><br />The Editors have always struck me as Interpol's IQ-challenged sibling. Both outfits are heavily steeped in the same gloom-and-doom idiom, drawing comparisons to early post-punk Brit bands Joy Division and Echo & the Bunnymen, but Tom Smith never sounds at ease behind the microphone. It's like he's slightly out of tune. On this outing, he shuffles uncomfortably between singsong Broadway and an imitation of Andrew Eldritch. The songs get more self-indulgent as they go along, until the album culminates in \\"Walk the Fleet Road,\\" a senseless, plodding exercise in falsetto overtop a bed of syrupy synthpop.<br /><br />What I guess you could call a departure from its earlier albums, \\"In This Light\\" finds the band almost completely morphed from a drums-bass-guitar formula, to layer upon layer of synth and what could be an iPhone drumming app hooked up to a speakerbox. It's as if The Editors are aiming for a (more marketable?) The Killers-Depeche Mode sound. Without at least the rock foundation, the album comes off all skin and no meat. Not satisfying at all.ying at all.
B002IVLH60|5.0|This is one of the best pearl jam albums I have ever heard. It is pleasant to the ears. I think every song was well written and created to lift your spirits. Not many alternative rock bands posses rock to please your ears to want to give it more and more listens. Pearl Jam really rock I really mean it. They are a good role model band for others to follow. They don't curse, they play pleasant rock n roll, the lyrics are creative, and it's very enjoyable. Good music to play whenever you want to feel good.
0307408833|3.0|My son has an egg allergy and is wheat- and dairy-sensitive, so I was excited to see this book.  I've tried a few of the recipes and they're ok...if you can afford agave nectar and coconut oil in copious amounts.  For me, even buying in bulk is too spendy-I bake every day or other day at least!  So for now, unfortunately, it's back to substituting spelt in all my vegan baking recipes.  I had higher hopes.  A word on the Gluten Free all-purpose flour: I don't like sweet things-I halve the sugar in almost all my recipes-but in the recipes that call for this stuff, you really need it.  It's nasty.  I don't like loading more sugar into a recipe to hide the taste of the flour, even if it's agave nectar and supposedly better for you.
1591843162|3.0|I, like several other people, donated some money to a charity and was able to read an early release of this book. Seth is a brilliant and creative marketer. It is no surprise that there are so many 4 and 5 star reviews for this book since most of these reviews are from people who received an early release of the book, just as I did, and are likely already fans of Seth.<br /><br />Not only this, but these people are likely already Linchpins themselves and are going to be very receptive to this book because they already have a connection. It's always exciting to read a book and say, \\"Wow, that's me!\\" or \\"So that's why I think that way.\\" I think this book does a decent job of encouraging people who are already Linchpins (people who are the glue that holds a society or company together by their creativity, adaptability and generous spirit) to continue to do what they are doing. I'm not sure that anyone else, other than someone teetering on the edge, would find the book near as riveting.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKED<br />The first third of the book is really good. I flew through it and found it very inspirational. If you are already a Linchpin, you will probably love this part of the book. He tells you that you are a genius, discusses how American society has been built on cheap replaceable labor, and explains the mindset of Linchpins and why they are better able to survive and flourish during difficult times.<br /><br />I thought he had some great examples of people who go out of their way to show generosity and integrity. It certainly made me take more notice of these types of people in the world around me and appreciate them more.<br /><br />I also liked his reference to Steve Jobs saying, \\"Real artists ship.\\" It is great to see people who are able to fight through adversity and actually deliver a product or service rather than just wishing they could.<br /><br />WHAT I DISLIKED<br />About midway through the book he began talking about your lizard brain and the resistance. Maybe I'm fueling the resistance by saying this, but I guess that is what keeps this from being a one-sided critique. Seth basically divides the brain into two parts, the lizard brain or limbic system, which is all about survival, fear, anger and resistance, and your creative brain or cerebrum, which is, as Seth puts it, the newest and most sophisticated part of our brain that is always overruled by the other parts.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Seth encourages you to completely ignore your lizard brain and focus on the creative, artistic part instead. Regardless of whether you agree with this or not, toward the end of the book, Seth laments the NO FEAR motto as, \\"either disingenuous or stupid.\\" To be fair, I think he is talking about recognizing your fear and managing it, but after his tone earlier in the book it comes across almost contradictory.<br /><br />Much of the latter parts of the book come across as Seth trying to be convincing, but either not certain of the best way to do it, or else uncertain of what he really thinks himself. For instance, in one place he says, \\"None of us knows the absolute truth, of course, but the goal is to approach a situation with the least possible bias.\\" Not ten pages later, he talks about people ignoring the truth by deciding to stay in their homes during a hurricane: easy to say in hindsight of the New Orleans tragedy, but what about before then?<br /><br />He also tells a story of how no passengers wanted to ride home with him in a rental car instead of remaining on a delayed flight and assumes that most of the people wanted to have a reason to blame the airline for their situation instead of themselves. In reality, these people made a choice, just as he did, but it wasn't the choice he wanted them to make so therefore they must be wrong. After all, he knew the truth of the situation and they didn't.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />I know it may not seem like it from this review, but I actually have a lot of respect for Seth and have found a lot of his writing to be very insightful and inspirational. If you are already a dedicated person and worker, you will probably find the first part of this book very encouraging. If your only reason for existence is to make a lot of money or just go to work, collect a paycheck, and go play, I doubt this book will change your outlook on life.<br /><br />Seth does practice what he preaches. He's been working on this book for over 10 years and he finally shipped! I think the timing may have been dictated more by the current state of our society rather than his understanding of how to communicate and inspire the remedy.are already a dedicated person and worker, you will probably find the first part of this book very encouraging.

0307269760|2.0|The most interesting story is the last one, from which the book takes its title.  It is historical fiction, about one of the first successful woman mathematicians in the late 1800s.  Her life has ups and downs, but the title is appropriate because overall, she found ways to overcome the constraints on women at the time (especially in Russia), and experience self-determination.  However, to use \\"Too Much Happiness\\" as a title for the whole book seems a cruel joke.  The very first story feels devastating.  I am not completely averse to dark material, but to put me through all that, I expect some sort of payoff at the end.  The ending is inadequate and contrived.  It reminded me of the beginning stories of children who don't know how to end, so they write, \\"Then I woke up, and it had all been a dream.\\"  After the first story, I almost returned the book with the remainder of it unread, but I forced myself to slog through the rest of it, to try to appreciate Munro's \\"genius.\\"  Most of the other stories have similarly dark subject matter.  I didn't love any of the characters.  Few of them dealt with their circumstances in a way that inspired me, except for the old lady in \\"Free Radicals\\" and maybe the old man in \\"Wood.\\"  This book made me wish to ask the author, \\"What was the purpose of writing these stories?\\" Was it mainly as a catharsis, to exorcise her own demons? It certainly was not to inspire her audience.  I came away from most of her stories, as I came away from watching the movie, \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\"--with the idea that, \\"Jeez, my life is not so bad, by comparison.\\"  I will be seeking out other authors, who can leave me with more than that!  Also, in my large-print edition, in the last story, sometimes the protagonist's name was misprinted as \\"Sonya,\\" while it was supposed to be \\"Sophia.\\" Where was the proof-reader?
B00005NQCB|5.0|This is one of those albums you just gotta sit down and really listen to. This is an Australian band who had a string of hits in Australia, but finally broke thru in the U.S. with the single releases of \\"Electric Blue\\" and \\"Crazy\\" which may be available on various compliations, but I think if you purchase this album, you will not be disappointed. This is one of those rare albums that's just put together really well. Stay 2nd, and enjoy :-)

B000V6BE6C|1.0|This review is posted as a direct result of username \\"barbarian\\" intentional posting of bad reviews for bands that play at least better metal than this steamin pile that he gave 5 stars to. Let's review \\"barbarian\\" style, shall we?:<br />1. Critical Acclaim - Anyone should be critical of any accalaim given to this waste of 5:14 sec of your life...<br />2. Almost Easy - Ironic because it was very difficult for me to make it through this 3:53 sec of excruciating pain.<br />3. Scream - need I explain that that's what I was doing within seconds of hearing this pitiful excuse of \\"music\\"?<br />4. Afterlife - wishing for it and the end of the current by the time half of this some was through...<br />5. Gunslinger - wishing I had a gun near by when this Shadow singer started in with his \\"who screwed the pooch\\" vocals...<br />6. Unbound (the wild ride) - yes, what a wild ride it was...and I'm glad it only lasted 5 min 11 sec<br />7. Brompton Cocktail - actually i was wishing more for pure Georgia moonshine upon hearing this screeching cat.<br />8. Lost - wishing I was lost...hiding away from the insanity contained in this mindless stint of torture.<br />9. A little piece of heaven - more like a lot of living hell to make your way through vocalist Shadows seemingly random blabbering screeches.<br />10. Dear God - I was pleading with him too upon hearing this...Dear God guide me to find the stop button ASAP!<br /><br />All in all, this band sucks in general and the lead singer should be led out in a quiet meadow...be given a head start and then gently shot from a distance of not greater than 500 feet from a sniper rifle.

B0026P3G12|1.0|I played Susan Boyle's performance on British TV on UTube over and over and tears came to my eyes for how beautiful her voice and how sensitive her presentation. I couldn't wait for the DVD. I must have cried over and over after I played it the first time for having spent the money. Her voice is still lovely but the choice of songs is poor, her crowning glory from Les Mis is somewhere in the middle and you'll miss it if you're not paying attention, and it's just plain disappointing. Another example of some smart and fast marketer taking advantage of the moment to get a product out, any product. It sure didn't do Susan Boyle or her career much good in my opinion. Stick to the UTube performance.
0525478183|3.0|I originally found out about this author by reading \\"Looking for Alaska\\" which I thought was a great book. Very funny with some sadness to it as well. This book has that, but the end I thought was a little anti-climatic. I just waited for it to go somewhere and it just didn't. But over, it was an ok read.
B0000062GK|5.0|If you love the electric guitar and desire more than just mindless shredding, look no further than Joe Satriani's Crystal Planet. Joe sets himself apart from the other guys with some real rocking tunes as well as downright beautiful melodies such as \\"Love Thing\\".   Some of his best work since \\"Surfing With The Alien\\". Joe is what I would call the \\"musicians musician\\".  Joe is a humble guy and probably doesn't realize how talented a guy he is unlike a few musicians. You can't go wrong with Crystal Planet.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said before? Fresh, honest, heartfelt. A gem. Masterpiece, even. I grew up the same way the main character Tom did (Smiths / Joy Division obsession and all). I would say I'm just like the main character, which is partially why I love this film so much. To wear one's heart on one's sleeve may be considered a burden by most, but to me, it's the only way to live.<br /><br />Buy this film. Love this film. Watch it over and over.

B002ZG4Q5W|5.0|After researching this Blu Ray release I am very confident that it is the best that this film has looked on home video to date.  The most compelling argument for this Lionsgate release is the extensive comparison done by DVDBeaver.  The blacks are blacker, the colors more vibrant, the picture is sharper - it is a noticeable improvement all around.<br /><br />Also, the Studio Canal/Lionsgate Blu Ray does have a wealth of special features.  While this may not quite be up to Criterion standards, it looks pretty close.<br /><br />As for the film itself?  If you've read this far you probably already know how good this film is.  Kurosawa was a filmmaking genius, and this was one of his finest films.  This is a brilliantly told story done as only Kurosawa could have done it.<br /><br />The five stars is partly for the improved video quality over the previous home video editions (even if it is still somewhat flawed), but mainly for the quality of the film itself.  It's a brilliant movie.<br /><br />(After watching this Blu Ray I can say that the picture is clearly sharper than the previous Criterion DVD, and the colors are more accurate.  The contrast is better as well - the blacks are blacker, but detail in shadow is greater than on the previous DVD editions.  There is noticeable film grain in darker scenes, but that's a good thing to a point - clearly excessive DNR was NOT used.  It does look significantly better than the Criterion DVD.  It should, it IS a Blu Ray release.  Could Criterion have done better?  Probably.  But not a whole lot better.  This is a good Blu Ray release of a great movie.)
B002UXRH10|5.0|Just press play.   No one other than Beyonce can do rock, R&B, hip hop with such versitility  than Rhianna.  Rated R gives you an assortment of all of these genres with catchy lyrics, tunes and melodies.  Her personal relationship certainly had an impact on the song selection but she makes good on all of the painful moments she must had spent. It was an unfortunate circumstance to say the least but I would like to ask Chris what other chick could really compare.  Her vocal command and effortless delivery will make her an easy Grammy nominee.  I like all of the tracks.  Hopefully she will make videos for most of them especially, Fire Bomb, Te Amo, Cold Case Love, which I feel will give this album ever more longevity and revenue.  I love her Barbadian accent and beauty which is quite stricking.  Kanye was correct as he is most times when he said Rhianna made Beyonce step her game up. Beyonce expectedly took it in stride.  They both do what they do well.  Jay Z is quite fortunate to have both these gorgeous talented women in his company.

B002ZBT84G|5.0|Our heroes and favorites -- no matter how revered in our personal pantheons -- can be hard to love as they age and get to AARP age.  The ravishes of time and vices on the beautiful falsetto of Brian Wilson, the troubadour par excellence voices of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, and the velvet tones of Billie Holiday can make even devoted fans turn and run back to the discs of their primes (instead of their last or latest discs).  Now we add Gil Scott-Heron to the list. But it is precisely his descent into the deepest levels of hell and his return from there that makes the quality of his voice -- the cracks now in what was that amazingly smooth baritone -- the key message here.  I was already captivated by his take on Robert Johnson's \\"Me and the Devil\\" on the radio before I realized who it was.  Everything you need to know about him, his last few years and what it is to be him now is captured in that one track in particular (listen to his \\"The Bottle\\" and that tune back-to-back and you have stunning bookends for his career).  He has lived what Robert Johnson first sang about and is now looking for the place where his \\"soul can catch a Greyhound bus and ride.\\"  Make no mistake:  this is a blues album...and just like some the Delta's best, it can be hard to listen to if you are wanting to be lulled by soft beauty or pleasant sounds.  But no record has hit me this hard and made me pull to the side of the road to relish it since the first time I heard Grandmaster Flash's \\"The Message,\\" Alanis Morissette's \\"You Ought To Know\\" or Brian Wilson's \\"Surf's Up\\" (all the blues in their own way).  This has already sealed a place on my list of Best 10 of 2010. Who knew that Dylan, Gil Scott-Heron and Joe Bonamassa would each in his own way make Charlie Patton the center of their universes and, in turn, bring him into the 21st century.

0783225903|5.0|Brazil was originally released in two versions: the 142 minute European theatrical cut, and the 131 minute American theatrical cut. Terry Gilliam approved both. Then there was the 94 minute \\"Love Conquers All\\" version shown on American television, which everyone agrees is dreadful. Brazil is one of my favorite films. I've seen the 131 minute cut about ten times, and the Criterion \\"director's cut\\", which is closely based on the European theatrical cut, two or three times, and I think the shorter version is better. We should learn from George Lucas that it is not necessarily good for the director to get everything he wants. The stuff added to the long cut is not that good, not necessary for the plot, and drags down the pacing. Another difference is that in the shorter cut, in the final shot, Sam is surrounded by clouds. It doesn't change the story but I think it's a better presentation of the ending. And there's one bit that's only in the shorter version: when Jim Broadbent slaps the plastic over Katherine Helmond's face, Sam says (ironically) \\"My God, it works.\\"    The item description says that the 1998 DVD is 131 minutes (or 132). This is incorrect. All DVD's are the long version, although the 1998 stand-alone DVD might be slightly different from the one in the Criterion collection. The 131 minute version was released only on VHS and videodisc.
B002C6K7N0|2.0|I must preface this review by stating that I love Megadeth.  I own their entire catalog.    There seems to be a large quantity of folks out there who have the opinion that fast metal equals good metal.  While I can agree that most tracks on this album fit nicely within the definition of thrash metal, I just don't think they're that good.  I think that the band members all sound tight together and the technical side of the guitar work is truly phenomenal. However, after listening to the album several times I still don't remember any of the riffs from it.  The riffs all seem to plod along at a hundred miles an hour, but I don't find them to be innovative nor catchy.  If this were an Yngwie Malmsteen album I might let it slide, but not an album from the guys (or guy in this case) who have given us songs like Hangar 18, Symphony of Destruction and Train of Consequences.    If the only problem with the album was that I didn't find the riffs particularly catchy, I think this would be a 3 or 4 star album due to the technical merits alone.  However, there is a far greater problem with the album:  the lyrics.  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not looking for Shakespearian sonnets here.  I don't even care if Mustaine writes about politics or religion or whatever, but I'd just rather that they didn't sound ridiculous.  To make matters worse, there is absolutely no flow to the vocals which only accentuates the shoddy writing.  If you sit down and read through the lyrics there isn't any continuity to them and it only gets worse as Mustaine tries to fit them into tight sequences of notes.    It's not my goal to disparage Megadeth here.  I have far too much respect for them as a band.  I just don't believe this album is that good.  I think a lot of the reviewers here have been a bit liberal with the 5-star ratings due to the fact that the music sounds like it could have been written in the pre-Countdown to Extinction era.  But, the difference is that the early Megadeth albums had riffs that were inventive and lyrics that mattered.  This one has little of that.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|If you've seen the first and second season, you have to watch the third one.  Dexter only keeps getting better and better.

0767827902|5.0|As a man who collects  movie's of all type's as one of my hobbie's ( I Have Over 300 ) I thought this was an excellent movie visually and as a period peice. In addition, it is the  first movie for Cybil Shepard  and the ONLY time she ever appeared topless on screen The part  by  Ben Johnson was excellent as always and if anyone is interested in  the  lifestyle in a     small Texas  town in the early 50's, this is excellent  movie.    I  Highly  Recommend  This  Movie.      Steve Mac    .

B00003CX9E|5.0|I will agree that this is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. It has a solid story, rich characters, beautiful cinematography, and, of course, a riveting performance from Orson Welles. The character study of Charles Foster Kane is the strongest part of the film, and it's really fascinating. However, in my opinion, I wouldn't necessarily call it THE greatest movie of all time, as some critics would say. To me, The Godfather takes that place, but that's a completely different movie. Also, while it is an excellent film, Citizen Kane is not one of my personal favorites. Movies such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, No Country for Old Men, Das Boot, & The Insider are some of my favorites, but Citizen Kane is not. I've seen it straight-through at least twice, and it didn't leave a huge impression on me. Still, I can acknowledge Citizen Kane as one of the greatest movies of all time (but not THE greatest). It's an excellent film, and it's hard not to like it. I would easily recommend it to every single moviegoer on the planet.
B000FA5TTW|2.0|Overall, I thought Alice Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones\\" was a decent way to pass the time I ordinarily spend sitting on a train listening to a podcast. Not very long, not very challenging, basically the literary equivalent of reality TV. We follow the story of murdered 14 year old Susie Salmon (\\"like the fish\\") and her post-mortem experiences watching her loved ones grow up with out her. Overall, there aren't too many surprises in this book (her killer is known right from the start), nor is there really all that much conflict. I was under the impression that the focal point of the book would be the hunt for Susie's killer. For the first half of the book? Sure, that's exactly what this book was about. It's at about the mid-point when Sebold clearly realizes that she's not much of a mystery writer, and instead tried to focus on the emotional pain the family members go through The author does fill some of the closing chapters with new story arcs that could have been interesting, but (in my opinion) fell extremely flat.
B002ZHKZD8|5.0|The flipper discs work perfectly well to start off so that it being a flipper disc is not a negative, but rather a positive since I can now play the DVD anywhere in my house.    The video quality itself is great, with nice deep colors and none to very little noticeable grain. The sound quality follows the video qualities example. The extras are also very well done, with a very informative commentary being the best feature of them all.    In summary, if you are a fan of the movies and blu ray, you'll love this package, as well with the other 2 flipper disc blu rays. They are not defective and are of a great quality all around.
B000V78URW|4.0|While I've been meaning to pick up this book for a while, I finally got around to buying a copy of Naomi Klein's \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" this past December. I always find it interesting to read \\"current events\\"-type pieces a couple years after things have settled down (most \\"current\\" references were to 2006), but I found that little has actually settled down regarding a large portion of Klein's reporting. If anything, some of the \\"slippery slope\\" situations she points out may have actually been... uh... slipped on? Since 2001, the \\"disaster\\" industry (surveilance, \\"anti-terror,\\" security, etc.) has boomed, making war and natural disaster something these industries need to survive, and the ties created by the Bush administration link the entire U.S. economy to the act of being perpetually at war.<br /><br />Her detailed descriptions of some of the ulterior motives involved in U.S. economic policy (Rumsfeld's refusal to sell his stock in the company that produces Tamiflu while simultaneously using his power has Secretary of Defense recommending that the Defense Department buy up large quantities of the same product he stood to profit off of, Cheney's well-known inside deals that allowed him to procure no-bid contracts for companies he had an interest in such as Haliburton) were eye-opening, begging the question: Who are our leaders really looking out for? Our best interest? I don't think so.<br /><br />She rails against the \\"free-market\\" economic theories of Milton Friedman and his Chicago-School approach to economics (basically, privatize as much as possible, eliminate public programs, cause an economic \\"shock,\\" and allow the system to self-correct itself). She outlines in great deal the results yielded by past attempts to implement this type of policy (see: Chile, Russia under Boris Yeltsin, etc.), and the economic collapse each of these countries faced following these experiments. Despite this, it seems that some historians continue to be blinded by the idea of Chicago-School economics, heralding each of these a \\"success\\" in their own right: revisionist history at its best.o-School economics, heralding each of these a \\"success\\" in their own right: revisionist history at its best.

1897166303|1.0|Obviously the positive reviewers don't have an overbearing, meddling, self-centered mother-in-law who refuses to cut the apron strings.    After nearly 12 years of trying to have a child (and dealing with a MIL who thought my infertility was all about her) I received 3 of these at baby showers for my newly adopted son.  Thankfully I read through all the children's books my son receives before reading any of them to him.  Crawling in your adult son's bedroom to rock him in the middle of the night.  Oh my, this made me nauseous.  ALL 3 went into the trash!!   Please, PLEASE, read all the negative reviews before buying this book, especially for a baby shower gift.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I am on day 6 of the 30 day shred. I did 2 days on level 1 and am now up to level 2. I can already notice my jeans starting to sag and my lovehandles melting away. I am significantly toned all over than when I first started. I started as a size 10 and although I am on a strict low carb diet as well I am already down to a size 8. The workouts are pretty difficult but they're 20 minutes so if you can hang with it until the 20 minutes is over you will be so glad you stuck with it. I'm looking forward to level 3 today and to see my results at the end of the 30 days!
B002H3F7F6|5.0|\\"The world is broken now/ all in sorrow/ wise men hang their heads.\\" -- Lullaby for an Anxious Child.    This is a very bleak album, a desolate rendering of winter.  Yet Sting manages to make it shimmer, with excellent musicianship and an emotional depth that has at times been missing from his more pop-oriented work.  Currents of grace do rise sometimes through these often religious folk songs, but often they feel like pretty ornaments clothing grim despair.  The soul of the singer here is definitely that of the \\"king of pain,\\" crossing \\"this bridge of sighs.\\"     At first I found this all a bit too monotonous, but I've become increasingly entranced by the album's moody solemnity.  More for fans of Sting's Soul Cages style than his world beatish \\"adult contemporary\\" or earlier jazz rock modes.  A beautifully bleak work of art that will continue to play, and haunt, for many weeks after \\"Christmas\\" albums have been put away.

B000OVLBFS|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie \\"Night Passage\\". The stories, although are not violently action packed are very realistic, human, and interesting with some good twists in the \\"who dun it\\" plots. They are filmed in beautiful locations, depicting very believable characters. I have purchased all of the Jesse Stone movies and have enjoyed each very much.

B000CNFC76|4.0|Every resident of North America who has taken up the game of golf as a hobby owes a debt of gratitude to Franis Ouimet, the former caddy from Brookline, Massachusetts. Ouimet's astounding victory at the 1913 US Open over two highly rated golf champions from the United Kingdom, Harry Vardon and Ted Ray, served to popularize the game of golf in the USA and introduce the sport to the masses. Prior to Ouimet's storybook victory, golf was the exclusive province of the wealthy and the privileged. After Ouimet's startlingly improbable tournament victory in 1913, players like Walter Hagen and Chick Evans made the game acceptable to the commoners.    The dramatization is remarkably accurate by Hollywood standards. The movie contains an occasional anachronism and the screenplay takes a few liberties with the plot (for example, inventing a romantic interest for Ouimet and making the tournament victory come down to the final putt on the 18th green when in reality Vardon fell behind on the 17th hole of the playoff round), but overall the story is wholly satisfactory. The dvd version of the film contains numerous valuable extras, which include an actual television interview with Ouimet recounting his victory fifty years after the fact.     Unlike the current generation of pro golfers, the players of this bygone era had to endure numerous hardships that made the game as much a test of stamina as of skill (in earlier tournaments, players were expected to complete two rounds per day in all types of weather and bogey golf was considered to be good scoring). \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\" is a fascinating recreation of a bygone era.
B00006JKOL|5.0|The next best thing to the vinyl cut of this album - with rich base notes and full bodied sound I would recommend this digital album to any audiophile with an appreciation for the genius of Jethro Tull.
B00319ECHE|3.0|I really REALLY wanted to love this album. Fear Factory has been a favorite of mine for a long time and Demanufacture goes down as one of my favorite albums of all time. Experimentation seems to have been all done away with on this album the abscence of Herrera and Wolbers is apperent. What is left seems to be a yes heavier yet less memorable album. Gene Hoglan is an amazing drummer but Herrera's drumming is a huge staple of Fear Factory and cannot in my opinion be replaced. Powershifter, Oxidizer and Last Exit stand out as great tracks but the bulk of this album seems to be rehashing and retreading much of the same old riffs and formula. One of the things I love most about this band was their willingness to experiment with various sounds and styles which has been done away with on this album.  Bell as always kills the vocals although I was a bit disappointed the man vs machine concept missing. I actually bought this album and Hypocrisy's latest album A Taste of Extreme Divinity and am much more impressed with Hypocrisy's latest effort. Overall Mechanize in my opinion is a good album but fails in comparison with the best of Fear Factory.
1401322425|5.0|I love this cookbook...true I haven't cooked too many recipes from it (YET) but those I have have been absolutely delicious..and they are so different from most recipes, with minimal ingredients, calling for a few fresh ingredients and really bringing out the best taste and flavor of each and every ingredient.  It is organized by season, which is great, so you know when you cook what is in season, then you're going to get the best flavor out of it.  The hardcover copy is a beautiful addition to my shelf.  Sometimes I pick it up just to read, even when I'm not planning to cook.
B002GYS1FO|5.0|This band just has IT.  Their groove is so nasty, thick and oil-soaked it just grabs you by the short & curlies and shakes you around at will.  An incredibly deep, thumping retro sound on most tracks, with some super mellow mayfield-esque slow jams for good measure.  \\"No Time\\", \\"What You Want Me To Do?\\", \\"Short Change Hero\\", and of course \\"How You Like Me Now?\\" are hot spots on a collection that's already scorched.
B002BW7A58|1.0|This is the WORSE Lil Wayne album in history. I cannot believe he came out with this mess. The music actually sounds pretty good, but the singing on every song is ridiculous. It wouldn't have been so bad if he could actually sing.   Also, I do not understand why there is a deluxe edition. There are only two more songs on the deluxe edition than the non deluxe album.
B002TKFEZK|1.0|The Kindle version is overpriced, especially considering the theme of the book. I guess the publisher thinks that this time their book is different so it is OK to overprice it.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|The Human Stain is the story of Coleman Silk, a classics professor with a terrible secret that is about to shatter his life in a small New England town. When his affair with a young troubled janitor is uncovered, the secret Silk had harbored for over fifty years from his wife, his children and colleague, writer Nathan Zuckerman, fast explodes in a conflagration of devastating consequences. It is Zuckerman who stumbles upon Silk's secret and sets out to reconstruct the unknown biography of this eminent, upright man, esteemed as an educator for nearly all his life, and to understand how this ingeniously contrived life came unraveled. If you are into light-hearted escapist movie, this isn't for you. The plot is intriguing, deep and difficult. I like these kinds of movies and this one is one of the best in class.

Here he finds a new talent, tackling people by pretending they're making fun of them.

A lightweight comedy handled with playfulness. \\"The Waterboy\\" scores big points for laughs. If you want an hour and a half of fun, see this movie.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I bought this CD/DVD-A for something to play in my new car's 5.1 Surround Sound system.  It lives up to all expectations: entertaining, high quality sound, and it beats the demo DVD-A that came with the car.     This is not a \\"best of\\" Beatles music; it's a soundtrack of Cirque du Soleil's \\"Love\\"...a show (at the Mirage, Las Vegas) built around a montage of Beatles songs.  There aren't many early Beatles songs here; they don't fit the Cirque format (if you've ever seen a Cirque de Solei show, you know what I mean) or the 5.1 format (many were recorded in mono).    I haven't listened to the stereo CD version since I bought it specifically for the 5.1 format.  But based on its content, I wouldn't recommend this CD/DVD-A except for the novelty of the 5.1 playback or for someone who wants to relive the show itself.    And, finally, buy the mono box set if you are just looking for Beatles music!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|HBO continues to amaze me with its mini-series.  With the depth of personality development and historical (or in the case of The Wire, current events) accuracy, they develop stories and ideas that I have never seen so finely achieved in any other fictional film media.  This series in many ways is even better than Rome - less melodramatic, a better treatment of the issues, and a wider historical canvass.<br /><br />This is essentially a bio-pic of one of the neglected founding fathers.  Starting with his career as a shrewdly ambitious lawyer in the British colony, we witness Adams as he becomes a revolutionary, following his more radical cousin, Sam Adams.  He established his national career by defending the troops who fired upon colonial subjects in the Boston Massacre:  he was impartial, relied on the law rather than mob rule, and on the street meticulously put together his case, which showcased his political skills.  His court victory, shown with high drama, got the attention of some of the best minds of the age, getting him into the original continental congress as a delegate, leading next to his ambassadorship in France and then Holland.  In each locale, we get a wonderful window into the local society:  it is funny, evokes the political culture, and portrays the evolution of the characters in it (i.e. Franklin, Adams, and Jefferson).  Upon return to the US, Adams is chosen as VP to Washington, then the second President.<br /><br />While you get a great sketch of Adams' career in context, the film does not shy away from showing Adams' warts, and there were many.  He was an irascible presence, concerned more with ideas - his idea of what was right - than the practical realities of politics.  Interestingly, as the US was in formation, this was in many ways needed:  he was setting precedents as he went along, which other would emulate.  However, this meant that he was not the kind of politician you would want at the top, at least in my reading, as he often couldn't compromise and confused being right with getting things done or at least preserving the potential to do so in the future.<br /><br />In addition, those around Adams are given a depth of treatment that is sadly lacking in the supporting characters in most historical films.  Abigail, Adams' political anchor and partner in love, is by far the best character, but there are also their children, many of whom had troubled lives, perhaps due in no small part to Adams' rigidity.  Jefferson is particularly subtle:  a brilliant and charismatic man, you can sense he is always operating in accordance with his own political calculus, though he is and was a good friend to Adams before becoming his worst political enemy; while conservative in terms of limiting the power of the federal government, he was also a radical democrat in favor of the French revolution and advocating a new constitution for every generation.  Franklin is also wonderful as a protean adaptor who revels in his environment; he was often at odds with Adams in terms of method and life style, but respected and then then used him to higher purpose.  There is a hilarious scene where his relationship with Madame Helvetius is made clear to an outraged Adams.  These portraits jibe wonderfully with my own research into these fascinating pols, who frankly ran rings around Adams in his rigid righteousness.  Finally, there is Washington himself, the great unifier, whose work takes place for the most part off stage.  The actors for all of these characters are absolutely first rate.<br /><br />To be honest, I was a bit wary of this purchasing this.  Though I greatly admire McCullough's writing powers, I think at heart that he is a sentimentalist, giving a kind of softball version of mythic American figures without enough context or skepticism.  I have not read his Adams book and will, for in this series I happily found I was wrong about his limitations.  Unfortunately, the accompanying mini-documentary shows him as a self-satisfied, if consciously humble, everyman who wants to produce literature as popular history (at which he definitely succeeds, don't get me wrong); he goes on and on about how happy he is, what a charmed life and marriage he had, etc., in the silliest kind of hagiography that exemplifies the sentimental mythmaking that I find an utter bore.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.

0446567329|5.0|When I first heard about this book, I was helping my Uncle shop for his 2 young adult children christmas presents. This was his first year doing the christmas shopping by himself since thier mother, his wife, my Aunt had passed away last Christmas. On his daughter, my first cousin, she had on her list she wanted the book Dear John. Well after picking it up and reading the back I just thought maybe she wanted this book because she was going through a separation with her husband whom was in the military as well and she had received a Dear Jane letter. However I did not choice to purchase myself one, well I had never read any of Nicholas Sparks Books, but for some reason I was shopping for something to read for my trip to Aruba in January. Well let me tell you, I started reading this book on the plane, I could not put it down. Even on my first day in Aruba on this beautiful Island, I was still reading until I finally finished.    However I was disappointed in the Dear John movie. Nothing like the book. So Read the book, forget the movie!  Veronica  Southeastern NC

B00196W840|5.0|John Steinbeck is an insightful, observant writer and East of Eden is a supreme example of his work.  The characters are at once both absolute realism and larger-than-life symbols.  Life blooms from each page as moral lessons are deduced without preaching.  Well worth the time to read.
