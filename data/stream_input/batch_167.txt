B0028K2RMO|4|I had bought this item before for another one of my grandchildren, so I knew what I was buying.  It serves it's purpose.
B006UYHX9G|1|Bought this before my son was born in February 2014, took it out the first time last week since I bought it,  tried to get the FREE app in three app store and it's unavailable,  or can't be found!!!! Called Infant I no hotline SEVERAL times and emailed them with no response to anything.....
B00AJSJE3C|3|It was a little shorter than I wanted and even thought there is a range for width I was having difficulties becuase with out the extender bar it felt a little short but I couldnt even get extender pice in.
B0081ZOV06|3|These were not as pliable as the pacifiers that my infant son had been using prior to the purchase.  He's 5 months old, and doesn't like using them.
B000XE4EP0|5|I've been deciding betwieen this one and the smaller version, and I'm so happy I went with the one that has taller back support. I started using it with my 5.5 month doughter and she loves it, she seems very comfortable on it. We've been using it every day, for over a month now. She goes between 5 to 11 times a day. I still get to change 2-3 wet diapers a day, but for the past 16 days she went #2 only in her potty and not even once in the diaper.<br />It's very easy to clean. Perfect size. Love it.
B000VLX1UO|5|This is an excellent attachment for the stroller. It is small, light weight and very easy to use. I would recommend this product to anyone with this stroller.
B00KZTY8N6|5|Super cute. Helps avoid the wet shirts from all the drool.  :)
B001WAJVZM|5|We have used this for a year now and it has been great. No mold problems and goes on and comes off easy. I love it and it does the job!
B00SK4V8YK|5|The engineers at SKIP HOP company got it right.  The SKIP HOP ZOO TABLET COVER is totally excellent in every way.  Although the illustration of the product shows the image of a monkey, this is merely a paper insert that must be removed before using the product.  The right side and left side of the product have red-colored flaps.  These flaps are really like handles, suitable for when you want to move your iPad around, while avoiding putting your fingers near the iPad's screen.  However, it is my guess that the red-colored flaps was more intended to provide amusement to users that are children.  The iPad slips easily into the product, and the Velcro on the fastening flap is easily secured, ensuring that your iPAD will not tumble out.  EASY ACCESS TO ALL BUTTONS.  Cut-outs in the simulated leather allow entry of the earphone jack, allow easy access to the on/off button on the top face of the iPad, and also allow easy access to the power-off button that is located on the edge of the iPad.  Once inserted, the volume control is easily accessed from the top.  As mentioned above, a large flap with Velcro ensures that your iPad will remain secured inside the SKIP HOP ZOO TABLET COVER.  POSITIONING YOUR iPAD ON A TABLETOP OR FROM AN AUTOMOBILE SEAT.  The rear of the product has a large flap that serves as a leg, for those who want to set up their iPad in the manner of a conventional television screen or conventional computer screen.  The large flap is made of thick simulated leather, and it is connected by way of a sewn-on hinge, and also connected by a thick canvas strap.  The thick canvas strap limits the extent that the large flap will flop upwards.  Also, the rear side the product has two belts, one to the right and one to the left, where each belt has Velco on it, enabling you to secure the iPad to the headrest of an automobile seat, for the convenience of passengers in the rear seat.  The two belts are also colored bright red, apparently to make the product more attractive to children.  The product also comes with an insert, for use in securing an iPAD Air, in view of the fact that the iPAD Air has slightly different dimensions than an iPAD.  ADVANTAGES.  The advantages of the SKIP HOP ZOO TABLET COVER are many.  First, it protects your iPAD against damage that might be incurred when your iPAD tumbles off a table.  Second, it shields the sharp bottom edge of the iPAD from your hands, enabling more comfortable viewing when reclining on a couch or bed and watching.  Third, as mentioned above, the product has a flip-out leg that props up your iPAD in a vertical position, allowing viewing in the manner of a conventional computer screen.  Although the product is being marketed to children, there is nothing about the product, aside from the bright red color of the flaps and straps, to suggest that it is a child-oriented product.  COMPETING PRODUCTS ARE INFERIOR.  I have acquired other devices from Amazon.com that were intended for securing and protecting the iPADs the iPAD Air --  however, all of these other devices attempt to secure your device with thin elastic band  --  a design that cannot possibly prevent the iPAD from tumbling out of the device.  Also, all of these other devices are made of thin plastic that have no padding function at all.  In contrast, the SKIP HOP ZOO TABLET COVER is the work of intelligent engineers.  The engineers at SKIP HOP company got it right!!!
B0070U6R9Q|5|This is the only cup my daughter would take at first as a transition from the bottle.  The nipple is much like the bottle so it was an easier transition.  It also has not leaked!  This is great for us as the reason I am pushing so hard to get her off the bottle and onto a sippy cup is because she insists on turning it upside down and shaking it - with the bottle it is a HUGE mess - with this sippy cup - I haven't cleaned up a drop yet.<br /><br />**Update 11/9/2015** we used these cups exclusively from about 6 months to around 15 months and LOVED them.  I bought a few more after my initial review.  We replaced the nipples once or twice b/c they will break just like bottle nipples if the child chews on them.  These are the sippy cups that I buy for baby shower gifts and recommend to all new parents as a great transitional cup.  Our cups are still in great shape and will be handed down to the next kid w/ replacement spouts.  I highly recommend.
B0002PR43O|3|My son has been playing with this for about a month and loves it. The only thing he is not interested in is the toy bar, I wish I would have saved $20-$30 dollars and got one a little cheaper with out the toy bar! I have however had a huge problem with 50% of my sons cloths becoming stained with pink spots. I have been driving myself insain trying to figure out what was making this since it was appearing on only half his cloths. I read anothe review stating the flower toy had caused this same mystery stain with her son. Sure enough when I took a wet paper towel to the toy it turned up pink. I really like this toy, and I am going to try and cut off the flower, but you may want to try another model!
B0014KUGNQ|5|I love it!  My baby girl and I have both been sleeping through the night since we got it!  The best money I have ever spent!
B0035ER8FI|5|We are expecting twins and when looking into buying two of everything needed a slim, inexpensive crib. This crib is just perfect! It went together so easily and I assembled it by myself in about 30 minutes. I've ordered furniture online before and it arrived with broken pieces and scratches - not this time! It was packed very well and arrived in perfect condition. My only complaint is the sticker on the top rail. After spending 30 minutes trying to peel it off I found a suggestion on another site to use vinegar to remove stickers from wood. I soaked a paper towel in white vinegar and placed it on the sticker until the sticker became transparent. After that, you rub the sticker with the paper towel and the sticker just crumbles off. I was amazed how easily it was removed!<br /><br />I can't wait to try out this crib when our little ones arrive!
B000I2Q0F4|5|A colorful firefly, I think it's butterfly, other than firefly.<br />Anyway, it's very beautiful, suitable for new born baby.<br />My daughter like it, I use it to help her into sleeping. She laugh if i play with her by this toy. A good online shopping for me.
B006YCS52S|5|Just as I expected!
B004I110D8|5|After trying to find a way to heat a bottle up on the road or in a store with a hungry, frantic, crying baby a few times; I started looking for portable warmers.  I searched high and low, but every product I looked at had horribly mixed reviews- which usually doesn't phase me too much, but in the case of the warmers, I didn't want to take the chance.  I am so glad that I decided to buy this warmer/ thermos.  It works for bottles and later for heating up solids.  I put hot water from my Keurig in it before I leave the house and then if I need to make a bottle, I fill half or 2/3 with the hot water and the rest with water from my water bottle.  It comes out perfect every time!  The water stays hot in the thermos for hours, and it is pretty much idiot proof, portable, and leak proof.  Plus, I can make a bottle as soon as I need it- unlike the warmers that are plugged in or operate with the heat packs.  Another option is filling the white cover up with the hot water and submerging the bottle in it- and letting it sit in a hot water bath to heat up.  Although, I haven't tried that option yet.  It is even handy to have next to my bed, so I can mix warm bottles up during the night, so one of us isn't constantly running to the warmer in the kitchen.  i think this is an excellent option for anyone looking for a portable warmer- it is easy, convenient, and much more reliable than the alternatives on the market.  Give it a try!!!
B002WQVKGI|4|adorable lamp for a child's room.
B008BT07IW|5|Easy to assemble. Hours with any color. Sturdy and definitely holds up against a toddler. I couldn't of asked for a better product for the price.
B008C0R684|4|Works well.  The seat release is a bit of a problem but may be more to do with the seat than the base.
B008TTQ29W|3|Crib is very cute and does the job. The wood is very soft and shows dents from where it held pressure while in packaging.  Overall we like it.
B008CGY7DA|5|We have had this model for nearly four years now and we are very happy with this product. We now have four cameras...three in our children's rooms. It's so nice when the kids are upset in the middle of the night or are having trouble settling in to sleep to be able to watch them on the monitor and figure out whether or not to go in or to just leave them be as they settle themselves to sleep. When they seem to be sleeping longer than usual its nice to be able to check on them without waking them too. I would recommend a video monitor for any new parent or for anyone who has a troublesome toddler who gets into trouble when left alone in their room.
B000LEG2WA|3|I bought this bag after a friend told me that the reviews must be crazy because she thought it was awesome. I do like the bag--I think it is set up nicely, has plenty of room, and looks really good, but there are a few issues. My zipper broke after a few months of use. The company sent me a replacement, but it wasn't a good sign for such an expensive item. The bag just isn't wearing well. The gray is dirty and easily stained and the shoulder pad is starting to fray. The compartments are nice, but I feel like the changing pad doesn't fit well in its designated pocket once filled with diapers (which is how it's designed to work). I really like the design and it is comfortable to wear. I also like that it clips to the stroller. Overall, I'd buy it again, but only if the company keeps replacing parts!
B0085UDCRA|4|Bought this for my DD and she have no problem sleeping on it. Very safe to use. My DD used it when she was 2 months old till 7 months.
B00OLRI5BE|4|The product is &#34;ok&#34;. Not really superior to cloth diapers, and in some ways a bit more work.<br />The child I purchased this for, however, is a &#34;princess and the pea&#34; type. She hates rough spots, corners, rough textures, etc.<br />So she hated all the little button things on it.<br />That doesn't make it a bad product for most people, but I thought it would be good to inform parents with sensitive kids about it.
B000U5FOT2|5|Sturdy, great materials, attractive, easy-ish to open gate<br /><br />Haven't installed permanently, but have used it in travel situations. Glad I made the purchase
B0038IWHR0|5|I love this frame. My parents had just lost their dog and this poem went right along with his personality
B0088N4AVQ|5|Love this bag. However, if you're looking for something that's expandable and has closed pockets then this bag isn't for you. The magnet enclosures obviously won't work if the pockets are too full. These fitted bags are not very expandable either. So it forces you to pack the minimum for when you leave the house unless you want the bag to be overflowing. Quality construction. Looks great.
B00WTBMSR6|5|I bought this product for our little 18 months old boy as he was not letting keep anything inside. Once this installed on the sliding door it worked so perfectly and so easy to install. I JUST LOVE IT!!!!!
B005LNJFX4|2|I didn't think the flanges got good suction- I liked the idea of them being angled but found myself having to hold them on to get the same suction I did with medela flanges.
B0071GPAZQ|5|We are really really happy with this stroller.  We also own the Flite.  Both are lightweight for their class.  Maneuverability is incredible for both.  Our daughter is really picky about sitting in any baby holding device (we mostly practice babywearing) but she loves this stroller.!  Good quality materials and well designed.  Well worth the cost.  There was a reacal of the front wheel, and Bumbleride notified us, made the process easy (all we had to do was apply for a retrofit kit for the wheel) and we got it from across the country in 2 days!  WOW!<br /><br />We had no problems with the wheel to begin with, but it never hurts to be safe rather than sorry.
B00NJJA73Y|5|I love this chair so much! I actually bought it to go in my living room and I love that two people can fit in it! The grey color looks so chic and I love the style. I have small children so it is a plus that it rocks so I can rock them. It's also pretty comfortable and my children can even lay down on it. It's a great addition to my living room!
B00E5LOPB0|2|I bought six and we loved them at first but all 6 zipper seals broke off after a couple uses. Pretty annoying ! And I was pulling them open super carefully and hand washing . Still broke.
B008B917C2|5|These are awesome!
B009SFJ7SE|5|I love this. The only thing that I would say about this is that it has holes in on the side and it lets some air in. Other than that awesome product.
B00BNEBL14|4|This warmer does what it says. Keeps wipes warm and is easy to load and refill. The light glow is just aesthetic but useful in the dark. The diaper bag dispenser has been valuable when i was out and about. Glad i had it in my diaper bag. A good purchase indeed.
B003CH8IM0|5|Love this.  I use it daily!  My daughter loves being close to mama.  I've shared this with over 130 women in my mama group on Facebook.
B00674S1Y0|5|So far, so good. I haven't fully immersed my daughter in potty training yet, but she likes to sit on this seat and hold onto the handles.
B00ZGPFD6A|5|Great! As promised.
B000RI2GT8|5|Great bottle!
B0051SDW38|4|I have had no issues. Trying to put a breathable bumper is tricky but does work
B00P0NOLWK|5|Excelent!!
B00310T2SW|5|pure and clean easy to use
B0035ER4WU|2|For some reason my kids spill more with this cup. It seems to slip down from their hand more than our take n toss cups which were the same width along the cup.
B003Q4MI6G|4|It provided additional shade when required during a rainy or a sunny day besides it is easily fits and tucks away.
B000ALIN8U|5|This is my 2nd Halo Cotton Sleeping Bag and I LOVE them for my little one! They are great quality, are the perfect weight and wash really well - plus they actually last when using them for months on end (using,washing,drying,etc)! Great product! And I really like the fact that they are all cotton and no polyester.
B002K226LW|4|Absolutely adorable...I just cant figure out why it cost so much! Can hold quite a bit of food and is very durable.
B0049KYXL4|5|These are a keep sake.  The person that sold them to me via amazon is a saint because my sons best friend is thomas the train.  It has been about three years since I purchased these and i refuse to pass them down to any one.
B0064CTIC4|5|Love that it changed colors.  I can watch my LO and just glance at the color temp at the same time.  LO loved to play with it too.  Great product & highly recommend
B00EZZHOSC|5|wonderful
B0046Q8218|5|I LOVE this swing.  Color scheme is so beautiful....thank you fisher price for ditching the ugly pink!  Very very easy assembly, everything works flawlessly, swing motor is not loud at all and what sound it does make is soothing and rhythmic for baby.  All the features are just wonderful and I especially love the power cord option verses batteries.  The fabric to the swing is very well made and nicely padded.  I got my swing at babies r us for $169.00 minus $34 off with their popular 20% off coupon they mail out or that you get with your receipt after making a purchase in store.  I am 100% happy with this purchase.
B0045JKUU2|5|This chair, although more pricy than another I had, seemed to fit the baby much better.  The back of the chair is wide enough so she isn't crunched as in some others that I looked at.  Padding is nice, and the toys are a plus.  Well made, and this chair can be passed on to future babies, grandbabies.
B00K2M2N2E|5|These stickers are easy to peel off the page! That's a big deal too! I've had some that were nearly impossible to get off. These were a breeze. I like that they look just as good in black and white as they do in a color photo. They're thick and durable feeling. Baby doesn't tear them  up while she wears them for her picture.  wonderful stickers!
B00EL3P4TE|2|Don't waste your money. The material and sewing of this blanket is very cheaply done. Definitely not worth the $23.95 that I paid. I will be returning this item. I definitely do not recommend it's purchase.
B00198PQHY|5|i bought this based on the other reviews. i was uncertain how much of a hit it was after it arrived my 2.5 month old thought it was ok but not that into it. at 3 months it became her favorite thing. now at five months she similes when i turn it on and talks to it for a good 20 min. its one of our \\"stations\\" in the am that we move her through as we get ready for work. every minute counts and this one gives us 20 :D im looking forward to the future when we can move it onto her crib (it is currently on the bassinet). it is colorful, pleasant, love the remote control feature, soft glow of light is good for bedtime soothing.
B00J7S5FHO|5|Awesome product, can't believe the rotten criminals at Verizon, charge sixty dollars for a standard flip case. This product is a model of simplicity and works as advertised. It has four little blue LED lights that indicate that is fully charged, plug your phone in and go for at least two full days and nights without charging. It also has a very handy blue LED to help you see the charging connector in low light. It is a no brainer for the price, highly recommend and completely satisfied.
B002USE0Q0|5|These are not just great for swaddling but for placing on car seat or swing, keeps the new baby nice and cool.<br /><br />No sign of wear after scores of washes.
B0037NXP18|5|This was the first pail liner we purchased because it was one of the best prices.  Now... just over 3 years later, it is still in regular rotation!  The laminate on the inside has cracked and \\"scaled\\" over time, but with normal cloth diaper use (with the occasional diaper very wet from swishing in the toilet) it has not leaked.  Magic?  maybe.  Happy customer?  yes.
B00MS2PP1C|4|It's so cute, I love it!!!! But the diaper bag is not lavender color, it's like dirty pink with broun ornament.
B007ATWM46|5|Works great fits the standard toilet perfectly!
B00E5LYF8S|3|I love this bag - looks functional, stylish, light - everything you might ask for. But! Designers put the most outrageous pink in it for lining, instead of something more gender neutral like red or green or orange.. I continue to check every now and then to see if the inside magically changed to red, but so far- no luck! If the pink doesn't bother you - go for that bag. Its fantastic!
B007QBEUA2|4|We purchased these four our infant. They look great and are really strong. Since our son is still pretty young the glasses are enormous on him. We'll definitely get a lot of use out of them when he grows into them, but we have not really been able to use them yet.
B006SFUDSU|2|I was disappointed to find that these do not stay in the brackets if mounted with the insert facing down.
B00DQDBCX2|3|Difficult to get them to use.
B00E9RMHD8|5|Excelent
B003CK3LDI|5|The attached toy helps keep the pacifier in the babies mouth, it also gives something for the LO to play with or hold. To clean, stick them in the washer and then sanitize them.
B00005QI1G|5|This is the absolute best bouncer you can find!  Whether you have a fussy baby or quiet baby, babies will love it and Mom and Dad love it too!  I have recommended this bouncer to everyone I know and they love it.
B004GJXM74|5|I absolutely love these swaddlers.  We recently tried the Halo swaddler and it is so bulky that it is more irritating than anything, my my little one got her arms right out of it.  Using the blanket to swaddle works out well, but it also ends up bulky and can make our little one hot at night.  These are great because you can get a great swaddle without the bulkiness or heat (they also offer fleece swaddlers if you want a warmer one), they are much cheaper than most of the others out there, and she stays swaddled all night without getting out of it (like she did with the Halo).  I ended up buying several more after we tried the first one, and will definitely buy more when she grows out of the small sized ones.
B0009OLSYO|5|This potty is the smallest one I've seen, so it's great if you are pottying a baby. My son sat on it assisted from 3 months, and unassisted from 5.5 months, by which time he could plant his feet on the floor. It has an ergonomic design, so even when he sat on it for 10 minutes for his poops, I knew he was comfortable (the Ikea ones leave a red ring around his bottom). He's 21 months now and mostly uses the bigger BB potty chair, but still uses this little one sometimes, and also uses the Ikea ones. The Ikea ones are taller, less ergonomic, but generally the same idea. The BB little potty is definitely designed for babies, and maybe short toddlers. Since it's one piece, you just rinse it out. No crevices to get yucky germs stuck in. Oh, and I like that this potty and the bigger potty chair are flat at the bottom of the bowl because the Ikea ones are round and the pee slashes out easily--not with the baby bjorn ones, though.
B008J1QP7Y|5|Product just as described. Very satisfied.
B001J23ZNC|5|Fast shipping, stroller is nicer than I thought from the pictures. It is a little big and heavy but all double strollers are. I love the fact that it takes two car seats since I am having twins.
B0009ET49K|5|have been using this for 2 years now after going through several bottle brushes in a few months.  works fine for regular size bottles as well as the phillips and still using for longer sippy cups and the phillips sippy cups.  good construction.  no wire = no rust.
B001BMWABI|5|This product took into consideration the few criticisms of the diaper genie 2 and improved on it.  It has a little pedal you step on to open the top lid, you put your diaper in and release.  Truly one handed operation, minimal smell because of the way the internal clasp seals the bag when you step on the pedal, and you never touch the inside bag.  Occasionally, if I don't step on the pedal all the way, I get a whif of the internal contents because the clasp doesn't seal all the way...but I figure thats my fault for not doing it correctly.  It now has a handle on the front so you can carry it with one hand, and emptying is similar to genie 2.   If your a fan of the diaper genie...you'll like this product.     You do still have to buy their refills, and that is the one big drawback.  I've seen the price come down to equal that of genie 1 refills, so if your already paying for them, then its not a problem.  Our refills last 3 weeks with our toddler's diapers.
B00ATLI7QO|5|My son uses this stool in the bathroom. He uses it for the potty and at the sink.
B004DC9T8K|4|I bought this stroller because it appeared to be the best one for a running mother, and 1 month into using it, I am very pleased. It rolls really smoothly for both me and my infant. It folds and unfolds really easily, pretty much can be done with one hand. I've taken it all over my neighborhood which includes paved sidewalks and dirt paths...and it's even been up high in the mountains on a bike trail. Super smooth ride, she falls asleep in it almost every time. I took advice of others and took my car seat infant pads in the stroller to support her head/neck so that I could run with her sooner. I put her in it at 2.5 months and her head is super stable using my car seat pads. I don't give it 4 stars because it's so expensive and I think it should be more available. I've gotten looks from people like &#34;oh, you have the BOB stroller, you must be rich.&#34; Folks, I'm not rich, but I saved the money knowing I would want this and I found an out of the box model at Amazon that was hugely discounted. The infant pads and other accessories should be included for the full price OR the price should be dropped to something more reasonable for the average middle-class running mom.
B000VDGZSM|5|This adorable First Love Bug Doll is just the right size for little hands.  It is soft and cuddly and will be loved and slept with by any little girl every night.
B002FB7HY4|2|This bag is thin, but did it's job in the diaper bag without much of a problem the two times I used it.  It completely came apart at the seam the second time I washed it.  Would not purchase again, although I can probably sew it back together.  Get the Kushies instead.  You get two for the price of this one and they're much sturdier.
B004LD6VLO|1|Very disappointed. Not at all worth the price. Total piece of junk. The display numbers never displayed properly, very hard to set. No volume control so the music/sounds are so loud you can't really use them! It looks nothing like the picture either. Dom waste your money or time.
B004S2GCDA|5|I use this when we have a few guests over (they include 10 and 12 year old girls). They enjoy the cute colors and the divided plates.  We usually use paper divided plates, so this is my attempt to be greener.
B002UHKMRM|5|Buy these instead of those unsafe crib sets.  Not only does she have safe bumpers on the inside, but the other day she was playing in her room, fell, and these bumpers protected her head on the OUTSIDE of the crib as well.  Right then I knew they are well worth the price.  I also love that I can easily change her bedding without removing them.  These bumpers are easy to use and most importantly SAFE inside and out!!
B00IOGHSNO|4|We have a Graco Ready to Grow double stroller & this easily attaches to it.  Having 2 year old twins and expecting a newborn, we needed a solution but didn't want to buy a triple stroller.  This has worked really well for us.  The twins love taking turns &#34;driving&#34; and sitting in the seat.  It does look like a really small bucket seat, but has worked well for my now 3 yr olds that are not small - weighing about 34 lbs.<br /><br />Warning that the straps need to be pulled & secured very tightly for it to function well!  Though it is a bit awkward to walk/reach around and doesn't always turn/back up smoothly...I would recommend this as a solution for needing an added stroller seat!
B000U5FOT2|5|I bought this gate a year ago to block the large entrance to my front door. I have 4 huskies that bombard the door when someone comes in & after one of them got out while someone was coming in, I decide I needed a barricade. This gate is great, very sturdy & considering I have 4 large dogs that was most important. I would highly recommend.
B005JDOYF0|5|I have the Keyfit 30 and just got the frame to use with it. I love it because I can open and close it with one hand which is handy when you have a little one in one arm. Two complaints:<br /><br />-- it isn't great on non-smooth terrain. It would be great if the wheels were bigger.<br />--drink console isn't deep enough. I have a coffee thermos that actually spilled over a bit because of this.<br /><br />I didn't do a ton of research on strollers before baby (too busy reading about other baby stuff) and decided on the keyfit 30 car seat a week before baby was born. I may not have gone down this path of chicco-ness if I did research but now that I'm deep into the chicco system, it isn't bad.
B000069EXO|5|Our favorite sleeper for our little one who can now roll. She moves a lot in her sleep and this keeps her safe and warm
B00QJT9OSA|5|One of my favorite diapers!!
B007ZZCQLO|5|This was the hit of the baby shower!  The mommy-to-be put it in the nursery closet that day and was thrilled with it.  The size separators are genius!  Love it!  Great color too.
B000LEG1PS|5|These disposable table toppers are the best!  They are thin plastic and easy to stick on any restaurant table. We take them everywhere, feed our toddler directly on the table and then pull it up when he is finished.  It prevents him from throwing dishes on the floor and allows us to avoid leaving a total mess for the wait staff to clean up after us.
B0000D14PW|5|I own the Original Bundle Me and bought the new Urban bundle me for my cousin's baby.  The Original Bundle Me seems to be warmer with the faux sheepskin on the inside instead of the micro-fleece on the inside of the Urban version.  The faux sheepskin seems to be cozier for baby, too.  When it is super cold outside, you have to add your own blankets inside either bundleme, but having the bundle me definitely helps keep the blankets where you put them.      One aspect of the Urban version that I liked better is that the nylon exterior of the Urban picks up less \\"debris\\" than the fleece exterior of the Original.  The fleece seems to attract hair, dirt, etc.  The nylon Urban is also rain/water resistant.  The Original fleece one never seemed to get wet even though it doesn't make the claim that it is water resistant.      Another point to make is that I bought the Bundle Me Lite for the spring and fall months, but didn't really use it all that much.  Unless you live in an area where the spring and fall months are cool for an extended period of time, I would just stick with the Original or Urban version.  Here I guess the weather goes straight from Summer to Winter!    The whole line of BundleMe products is an AMAZING god-send if you have ever had to put a baby into a coat or snowsuit and then tried to put the car seat straps around them.  I can't tell you which one will suit your needs more, just trying to help make your selection process more successful!!  Whichever one you choose will definitely make your life SOOO much easier!

B004ZWRJ6C|4|Easy to assemble.  The shelves don't feel terribly sturdy but you probably won't be putting anything too heavy on them anyway.
B00014PL9A|3|The carrier is great.  No complaints about it.  Evenflo, however, leaves something to be desired: we broke the front side-release buckle on the carrier by closing a car door on it.  Completely our fault.  I contacted Evenflo about a replacement buckle, saying that it was my fault and that I would pay for the replacement and shipping for the buckle.  They told me that they do not offer replacement buckles and suggested that I stop using the carrier.  Looking around online, I found a replacement buckle for $1.00 CAD.  I'm not sure what kind of company recommends throwing away a $120 CAD product because a $1.00 CAD part is broken, but such a suggestion is in my opinion inexcusable.  Although they make great products, in the future I won't be using products that are apparently disposable if the tiniest part breaks.
B0011URFRE|4|All around great seat coming from the Chicco Key Fit 30. Its long lasting and overlaps with the product before.<br />I only have the strap system from the Chicco but I adjusted pretty quickly.
B006T899QI|1|I was looking for a nipple that releases milk very solwly for my 1 week old baby, so I had high hopes in this product. It turns out that the flow is instead extremely fast, she was gulping down 30ml in less than 1 minute, to then vomit all of it.<br />I went back to the AVENT bottles, where at least you can control the flow, depending on how much you squeeze the cap.
B00CNY67BC|1|Bought this product thinking, Sony, now there is a name you can trust, wrong. It stops charging periodically, the volume will just randomly cut out even if you turn off the voice activated option. You need something reliable, you know, because this is for MONITORING A BABY and this product is not it.
B00BFQ5BMU|4|Protects my leather seats. I don't use the organizer as it is in an add place, below the feet. Useless really. Big enough to completely cover the booster seat width.
B00C4VX2KS|4|Cute design, but I don't think the sounds get quite loud enough. It's also annoying that the sound defaults to &#34;Twinkle, twinkle little star&#34; whenever you unplug it --- I move it from room to room throughout the day and I always have to reset the sound.
B0031KMAJK|5|We bought a different brand crib on Amazon and quickly exchanged it for the Delta Canton, and we're definitely happy with our decision.<br /><br />Construction:  Very strong, just a couple of real bolts (no cheap aluminum cam-locks).  Real wood throughout.<br />Appearance:  Very nice design, the &#34;feet&#34; stick out just slightly so your back-rail is not against the wall.  Looks solid.<br /><br />We received it with a small defect in the wood on the front grill and a dent on the side but Delta is sending free replacements.<br /><br />THIS ITEM IS BUILT WELL ENOUGH TO BECOME ANTIQUE IN 25 YRS.  Built to last!
B0062BVY42|1|These cups were bought as an alternative to the infomercial WOW cups. They seemed great. But after 3 washes they leak :(
B001U0PVWG|1|I can't believe I wasted almost $70 on this product.  First of all, it is hard as a brick.  I don't blame my infant for hating it.  His pack-n-play bassinet is more comfortable than this thing. Second -- it is too narrow.  My son is only 2 weeks old (around 9 pounds) and doesn't fit comfortably between the side positioners.  The only positive thing I can say around the product is the light -- I found it helpful when searching for the binky &/or trying to southe my little one in the middle of the night.  Otherwise, a complete waste of my time & money.
B001L3ZC62|5|My two year old son has had his Bailee the Bunny since he was 3 months old. Trust me, this Bunny has been through a whole lot of loving. He can't go anywhere without him. I highly recommend!
B000RFC3BM|5|this is very useful for my baby when giving him puree food... the rest of it, i will just have them placed on my baby's high chair and have him play with it..
B001U9OUYC|5|Good investment for my baby.  Just bought a second one to go travel with (hate to change diaper on the slanted back seat).
B0043D28B4|5|Our boys are almost 7 months now, and giggle and laugh when we read this book.  Sometimes we don't read the actual words, just talk about the pictures and show the flaps, but certain pages make them smile right away.  They have loved this book since we first showed it around 5 months of age.  We have two other Lamaze books so far (Panda's Pals, and How Do I Feel?) that are supposed to be good for young babies, but those books don't hold the boys' attention as well and have no flaps to lift.
B00OC6CKP6|5|these are amazing they fit so well they don't leak and the Misses don't stain the white inside material:! It's beautiful well put together easy to put on and take off I would like to get more of the inserts but I love this day thank you!
B0011URFRE|5|This is an amazing car seat. It's so easy to understand and use :).
B003YC0W86|5|I love this monitor, good quality image, right size, easy to use and carry on.  It just has interference with microwave while it is activated in the same room, but I think it is normal.  Highly recommended.
B001HLFPMY|5|I purchased the bedding outfit for our toddler being moved from her baby bed to the toddler bed.  We are very pleased with the quality of the sheets and quilt.  Good quality, good value!!!
B000GKY1N6|2|Cute but SMALL - Bought as gifts - Had to buy something else - Made me feel cheap
B00SP3TZNW|5|Loved the multicolored Baltic Amber necklace from this company! High quality and a great price. It's been helping with my 4 month olds teething. Customer service is awesome, highly recommended this shop.
B00M7TB07E|2|The writing on the shirt was coming off the first time I washed it.
B002JH7NXO|1|I chose this rating because as I began to wash my baby hair the water ran down his face....it didn't stop anything!!! Poor product!!!!
B002M77N22|5|As a first-time mom, the most terrifying time of day was nightime, when I was asleep and couldn't monitor all my baby's movements and sounds. Add SIDS fears, and I would panic at bedtime! We put her in this the first night home from the hospital, and I felt much better. We put it right next to me, and I could easily peek at her when she made noise, and easily see whether she was awake and needed to eat, or just moving and making sounds.  My daughter also had reflux, so this eased my mind about spitting up and choking (she spit up a lot, even though she is breastfed).  There are a couple of important things to know about this, though. First, the AAP recommends babies sleeping on a flat surface to reduce the risk of SIDS. Babies with reflux sleep better in equipment like this, so you need to weigh the risks and benefits.  Second, weaning her out of this was painful!! Even though she napped in other places (on us, in her crib), it took 3-4 nights (at about 6 weeks) before she was back to sleeping as she had in the rocker. She would fall asleep on us, then open her eyes immediately when we put her down (but rarely did this in the rocker). She now happily, peacefully, and easily sleeps in her crib at night.  For the next child, I will start with the crib, but would use this all over again with my first. It really gave me peace of mind and made frequent breastfeeding easier.
B000324Y7U|4|We have 2 bouncy chairs, in this one my daughter can lean over far enough that she would fall out if she was not held by the belt but  she has fallen far enough that she can not get back up though.(this is without the light bar on)  Our other seat has a deeper butt section and does not have this problem. <br />They do like the light bar and music
B000067PE5|5|I bought this for a baby shower and the mother was very happy with the Pacifier Rinser. I hope to buy more for next gift.
B002ITOC7S|5|I can not say it enough, I LOVE my Snuza. I recommend it to every new mom I speak to. Babies very easily roll off those movement \\"pads\\" the Snuza just goes with the baby. It gave me such peace of mind. I love, Love, LOVE this product! It is absolutely worth every penny, my husband even loves it & he originally thought I was being paranoid. Its so light its unbelievable. A MUST for a mommy =)
B0046N26YU|5|This is a great exersaucer and so different.  My daughter is petite and I needed something where her feet weren't dangling.  The seat height is perfect.  We bought this when she was just less than 5 months old and it was perfect.  She really enjoys it.  (The only part of it that is useless is the dangling, yellow horn off one corner, just a lame toy.)  She loves the mirror and the rattle and the microphone.  The music is cute and fun. She can entertain herself for a good 20 minutes.  I also like the fact that I can remove the seat when she gets older and she can still play with it.  Highly recommend this product!
B00EIGLTQ6|5|Great toy for a great price
B007A752K4|5|Perfect match for our other items!  Well made, nice fabric.  We would definitely buy this brand again.  Quality all the way
B00DJP14TE|5|The backpack is perfect for what we were looking for! It is light and easy to get my grandson in and out of.
B00483GAJU|5|These are my favorite liners and the seller delivered them promptly and well packaged. Will buy again !
B000EIB6RY|5|This fit easily onto my dream baby gate and gave me the extra length I needed.
B002HOQOMA|5|These wet bags are perfect for an outing.  They don't leak and keep in smells.  I've only been using them a few weeks, but so far, so good.  The only thing I would change is that they would only hold about two maybe three wet diapers.  I will have to send two in my diaper bag for a full day excursion or when my daughter is at the babysitter's all day.
B00006JZHI|4|Stylish bag, no doubt, but less room inside than I thought there would be.  I stuffed the changing pad in the bottom pocket which helped.  Otherwise great mesh pockets, zippers etc.  I read a lot of these reviews before I bought it and I see where the color confusion came in.  Some parts of the day it looks black, others it is clearly navy blue.  Either way, it's a stylish little tote and a heck of a lot less expensive than Kate Spade!!
B002EL4IYW|5|This is a very high quality mattress and I can feel good knowing that it is non-toxic and safe for my baby. He sleeps very well on it and seems  quite cozy. I use the American Baby quilted mattress protector since the mattress is not covered in plastic. In my opinion the mattress is way more important than the crib frame so that's where I cheaped out (I got a Graco Sarah crib on Amazon for $99, it fits well with the mattress).
B002YQS9TW|5|We loved this!  It is such an awesome idea!  We also bought a book that you can slip pics in for baby.
B002UD661W|5|excellent product, very good quality, as expected. very responsible seller
B000067K0L|5|Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!  My daughter has used this item since she was only weeks old, and she still uses it today at 6 months old.  Not only is it pleasing for the adult eye to look at, but I do believe that it has encouraged her development as well.
B00IH7E6OO|5|I bought it for my son's room at University - he loves it... and so does his roommate!
B004G4AKJ2|3|I've used this through 2 babies. I works just like it says. I used it in the high chair, walker, etc. However I really couldn't start using it until about 4 months when baby had good head control and then by 6 or 7 months baby was able to sit up well enough to not need it anymore. So in hindsight I wouldn't buy it again. I don't think it is worth the money for the short time I used it.
B000J4EKX0|1|This ran extremely small. I ordered a 2T for my 22 month old. It would have fit him at 1 year. I couldn't even pull them up past his knees. I do not recommend unless you purchase 2 sizes larger
B00M2UA7TA|3|I wanted to love this spork!  It is nice and small in height to fit in a lunch box... But the spoon part is soooo big!  It's more of a shovel than a spoon!  It works great for soup... But it's a little awkward to eat with for kids with little mouths!
B00ENXEZ3I|5|ordered this because it was a good price, i don't think ill use in bassinet or crib but this will be good for tummy time or extra cushion in swing or carseat.
B0088N4C8C|5|Very much loved by the little first who received this item as a gift. The perfect size for a young child's lunch. Very nice quality and it is very well made.
B00389VFH2|4|Its a neat system to keep a semi-enclosed space to reduce odors... but when you dump a diaper in the pail, the odor still escapes.
B003X3R6TO|5|I was new to cloth wipes and didn't know what to expect. These are great quality, durable and great feeling on the bum!
B000058DP3|5|Yep, a matching carseat (infant) with head snuggy is now available for the Glen Plaid Metro Lite!  I just bought one and it is very easy to click in and out of the stroller.  They are selling fast though- the Babies R Us near me sold their entire stock (about 15 of them) in three days.  Don't wait until the last minute to get one if you are as particualr about having a matching carseat as I am.
B00UQGW7CM|3|A bit difficult to see through the mesh in low lighting, but overall a good product for your new addition.
B002SZT35S|5|Has done it's job stated!
B0085E0ALC|5|These blankets are the best! I had my baby girl in the summer of 2014 and they have held up so well. Strings do pull more easily than the regular aden + anais blankets, but they are much softer. They have beautiful colors and patterns too.
B00A0ID90A|5|A great potty. Although it only does one thing (potty) and does not function as a toilet ring or step stool, it works phenomenally as a potty.<br /><br />Advantages:<br />Priced very competitively<br />Easy to clean<br />Insert has pour spout<br />Much bigger than some of the other potties (eg Disney) - great for large/tall toddlers<br />High back<br />Good splash guard
B008XA9640|5|Love the luggage. Perfect for young children....
B005P07HS8|5|I used these with my 2nd and now 3rd sons. Love Love Love Them!!!
B00005BX4W|4|This mirror worked great for us.  Attached it to a dog cage barrier that sits between the back seat and cargo area in our Jeep.  The mirror adjusts easily.  Definately a good purchase.
B006EVK68K|5|Today we used these guavamitts on our 3 day old baby girl and I must say we absolutely love it. She already has somewhat long nails and has been scratching herself. The mitts are staying on very well and looks super cute. These are expensive for baby mittens, but are certainly worth the splurge.
B00CXH2M2W|5|I'm on my second or third order of these.  They are stronger and last longer than the name brand version.  And you get more for the money.  Kind of a no brainer....
B002FQKB2Y|5|I was very weary buying a product like this online because there's so many of them. I definitely chose the right one. I love how sturdy it is. I have a ton of stuffed animals.loaded on it in my daughters room. Its fantastic and great quality. Buy it for sure!!
B005XENWTE|4|These are great wipes that you can feel good about buying!<br /><br />Information found on package:<br /><br />100% Plant Derived Ingredients!

Made in USA.<br /><br />1% donation of purchase goes to \\"For the Planet\\" charity.<br /><br />My review:<br />The package of wipes appears generous, 80 count, and good size wipes (7.1\\"X7.9\\"). It is a regular plastic-like envelope style with a pull tab opening. The wipes are quite moist, and sometimes leave a bit of dampness on the babys bum, but I kind of like the fact that they are able to *clean* - especially for the more messy changes- I feel quite sure that the area is actually clean- not just wiped off.<br />The wipes are kind of a medium weight thickness...they are not as thick as a Huggies type wipe, but not ultra thin like a dollar store type pop-up. They can tear though (probably because the fiber isn't as densely woven for easy compostability), a couple times when I couldn't get a hold of a wipe properly, the wipe would rip a little bit off. Not a huge deal to me because they are so generously sized ....a missing piece the size of my thumb hardly matters. But like I said, it doesn't happen often but is a possibility occasionally.<br />No linting or rashes from these. In fact, anytime my little one starts to get a rash from food-issues, it goes away very quickly- quicker than before I switched to these wipes. Not sure if its a result of the wipe or the combination of my 7th Gen diapers plus these wipes.<br />These are unscented, which is fine- but I usually prefer a light natural scent- but I really like these wipes and I am aware that a lot of scents are rotten chemicals anyway.<br />They are a soft, untextured wipe. (Meaning they have no print or texture stamped into the fiber, they are flat.) I prefer this style because the really rough textures tend to give my baby rashes, so I look for the kind that have the smoother texture.<br />All in all, I really like them and plan to order them from now on - or because these are out of stock (the 2 pack), order  the larger lot of these. I only rated them a 4 star, because they are a little overly damp when first opened and I know a lot of people don't care for that.(Even though I like that aspect.) And because they can tear occasionally.<br /><br />Hope some of this info helps! :)uicker than before I switched to these wipes.

B003II79P0|3|it;s ok
B0096ICL0O|5|Does the job. Cute. Clips fine.
B000JQ4B3C|5|this thing is just as good as the bob version If not better. we use it on our bob stroller and it holds everything I need it to hold. it's worth every penny ! I wish I could buy one for all my friends. if you're reading the reviews because you want to know if it's good. it's pretty legit. just get it . I have a bob revolution and it's perfect!
B0016L0MMS|4|I love how small this seat is.  I just keep it in the back of the car.  So far has been very helpful.
B001OC5UNK|4|The first one I received was damaged and unusable.  As soon as I made arrangements for its return, another one was on the way.  Although I works well and is good quality, I wish there were more size variations for the width.  The opening where it is used is just a little too wide to be as stable as I prefer (even with the larger extension) and too narrow to add the smaller extension.
B000HZDN9I|2|Bought this for my daughter....she loves it and it's a great way to entertain a baby, that's why I have it more than one star.  My daughter pulled off the tag sewn on the arch that shows foot positioning.  This tag is meant to stay on however my 10 month old pulled it off and ate it.  She choked and vomited and luckily I could pull it out of her mouth....just a word to the wise if you buy this be aware that the tag is not safe
B002J4U8P2|2|my baby loves this thing. my only complaint is that the suction doesn't work well at all!! you can detach the toy from the suction cup which is cool.
B00005QXPE|4|My in-laws live far away, and they bought this chair for my daughter to use when we stay at their house.  She has been able to comfortably sit in it since about 5 months old.  The extendable straps are great, and I've had no problem attaching it to a number of different styles of dining chairs.  I think my daughter feels like she is included more with the adult diners when she sits in this chair versus when she sits in her highchair at our home.  It really could be used as a permanent highchair.  The only reason I am not rating it with 5 stars is because the lid to the storage compartment on the back always swings open when I try move the chair, and has even fallen off a few times.  This storage compartment is useless and has always been a nuisance for me.
B006ZBIHVW|5|This stroller is wonderful.  I have owned MANY strollers in the 6 years I have had kids and this is tops.  Easy to fold, lightweight, easy to push and my 9 month old is very happy in it.  It is by far the easiest umbrella stroller to push and handles the cobblestoned, crooked streets of Germany (where I live) with the greatest of ease.  Some people have said that the shade is small, but you can push it down farther over the baby and seat.  I do not find that to be a problem at all.
B003N0JXSO|5|I love this stuff my cloth diapers come out fresh every time.
B00L2BMPRW|3|Directions are very unclear. Hate itself is sturdy but not great
B00501YN20|4|Super soft and fits perfectly on the changing pad. Really like the print. And super affordable compared to others on the market
B003DQC72C|2|this bracelet was easily removed by my teething 4-5 month old and as such presented a danger as easily a thing to choke on. disappointed
B00DU2T09W|4|The Squooshi pouches are great! My son loves them and they are very easy to use. My only complaint is that they don't seem to hold very much, and the zippered bottoms don't flare out to &#34;stand up&#34;. But those are minor concerns! They are cute, colorful, durable, and easy to fill and use by a 17 month old.
B006CFCNIE|1|I do like the night light feature of this unit. However the static gets so bad . one night it will be fine the next without moving it it is so staticy you can barely here child let alone sleep
B00GEF775Q|5|We put this little potty in the car for emergency situations.  Like we're leaving the store and don't want to try to wrestle the germy big toilet seats.  We put in the back of our SUV and have had to use it on car trips or short trips to the grocery store when my son just cannot hold it.  And an accident in the car is terrible so having this right there in the car is very convenient.  It's also very easy to clean which is another plus!
B0000E2DIE|4|Great Safety Product for kids. Installed on the bannister upstairs where my kid likes to stick his head and hands through. This product works great and is easy to install. The manufacturer gives you hole punch, grommet, screws and anchors, that could be required for installation. This product is clear. You will have to occasionally wipe it to remove hand prints. It is durable and fairly simple to install.
B004IY6AGW|5|As a mom & NICU nurse I can't ask for a better pacifer & little friend for your new bundle of joy. Each Wubbanub helps keep the pacifier in place and provides a cling to help soothe your baby!
B009SXIMP0|4|the length is really 53&#34; so i had to buy two, but still worth it. Looks great.
B00IIDRNWE|5|I love all of their products, but these are especially great because the fit perfectly on your shoulder and they can be worn as bibs for your baby as well!
B0018T1WUO|5|I bought 2 pairs of these along with Bamboobies and these are always the first ones I go to grab. They are so soft and absorbent!  I purchased x-small and was a 34B pre-pregnancy and probably a C cup now.  I think they definitely run on the bigger side.
B004OBZLUA|3|so it does what it says, however, SOMETIMES the kids skin gets a little caught in the folds, especially when they figit around (which is often - theyre kids). because of that, our daughter is now afraid of it so it has become useless.
B000YZD0QM|5|This car seat is ridiculously easy to install and use. i have the LATCH system, my husband doesn't. We bought one of these for each car and had no problem installing them with either. The only thing I've noticed is that we have to check each time we put him in that the shoulder straps are positioned on top of his shoulders. Our son is only 9 months and fairly small (17.5 lbs), so maybe we would have to check their positioning in any seat. Either way, I don't mind---you should check the positioning of all of your straps every time you put your child in a car seat anyway. Overall---love the seat! The colors and fabric are very nice. The baby seems to enjoy riding in it. Also, the TensionRight knob is awesome.
B007D1NKK6|2|We bought a bed from Ikea which has slats, and wanted to add this to make this very high bed safer. Unfortunately, because of the feet on the bars, it sits very high and creates a gap between the side of the bed and mattress, exposing the screws and creating a potential hazard where children might catch their fingers or get a toestuck. We instead purchased a bumper, which works perfectly and is much safer with that bed.
B0049O7OKC|4|I love that this makes it obvious that I have a girl in our gender neutral car seat. I mostly love it because it keeps people from putting their germy noses and hands in my daughters face. The main thing I don't like is that you can't put the handle down while this is in place.
B0007KMUH4|5|I have to say I went back and forth trying to decide if I should spend the $60.00 on this stroller when I already had a Metro Lite stroller. Well after a shopping trip to the mall using my metro lite as a travel system I broke down and bought it. It was the best choice I have made. I was so tired of not being able to get to the diaper bag in the basket with the seat of my Metro Lite reclined (I have an older model and you can't drop the basket down to get to your stuff). I would have to take the car seat out put it on the floor and then raise the back of the seat up to get to my stuff and when you have a sleeping baby you know this is the last thing you want to do. So I bought this stroller and have very easy access to the basket. I love the cup holders and it is very light and compact. Thanks Graco!!
B0030E9VK8|5|We bought this for our trip out of state. I know most people wouldn't take a crib with them but it saved us a bundle staying with family. Most hotels will offer you a pack and play which won't work with toddlers.
B003PCYMP4|5|Wubb goes everywhere with my daughter! The lamb doll is adorable and has enabled her to pick up her own pacifier and self soothe from the time she was a very small bundle.
B006UDLXGQ|5|Is very cozy, easy to remove, and wash. I would recommend this product. You can also use it in other seats such as bouncer chairs.
B004GJXM88|5|These work great. I have no children to use them with but I use them myself in public restrooms. They are just the right size.
B0070ZY80Q|3|It's a good product, but not exactly universal for all pedometers. I have a fit bit and I had to use a little ingenuity to keep the clip on.
B008HCXIU2|4|Good!!!
B004SBX6B2|1|One of the photos being used is a fleece blanket sold by a different company. I have the wholesale catalog from that company and have purchased the fleece blanket from them. Buyer Beware !!!
B000XT30G4|5|Shipping was fast and the gate works beautifully.
B0055DXEH8|5|I love aden and anais products but these bibs are great for a spitty baby like ours who has acid reflux.  We bought this larger size because even though our son is only a few months old he spits up a tin and I'm glad we went for this larger size.  They arrived on time and we are very happy with them.
B00AB5O6FY|5|These snaps are very high quality and easy to use!
B0038JDUUC|3|I really really liked these bowls at first. I would have given them 5 stars, but then I realized they were not microwave safe so that brought my liking down a bit. I was in a pinch and stuck them in microwave for like 30sec in order to thaw out some pureed carrots and the bowl in now totally stained orange! Very disappointing. I am staying away from microwave and just serving the food in them. I don't even use them for storage as I have notice some staining even in the other larger bowl that I didn't put in microwave.
B00QC2AYH4|5|excellent
B00GHAGDVC|5|cute and colorful
B004R97LX4|4|The rain cover fits the stroller very well. I used this rain shield about a dozen times and unfortunately one of the velcro straps fell off as it was only glued to the rain shield. I guess I expected a bit more longevity from this product.
B006T899QI|5|I love the calma!! My son has no problems using it and I like that when he drinks from it it 'squirts' as if it were coming out of the breast!!
B0052YO4WY|5|I bought this car seat when my baby girl turn one year old. The car seat has very nice fabric and it's very cozy and comfortable. The side impact head protection is big and it gives me a peace of mind knowing she is absolutely safe. It almost becomes a bed when reclined and every time we go on a road trip, she is the first one to fall asleep!!! I recommend this car seat to all mom's out there looking for good quality, safe and comfortable car seat!
B007Q4EGO4|5|I like this very, very appropriate is I want to ~ ~ next time and will buy, like this very
B001GQ2SA2|3|Baby really likes this toy, but the one-size-does-not fit-all-cribs design which makes the umbrella fail to spin due to tilt, and the frequent need to replace batteries (overly complex batter compartment) caused us to uninstall it, and question its value for the next baby.
B00GT0ACMG|5|Got two of these for our queen platform bed since our 5 month old is still co-sleeping.  They are unobtrusive and work well in our bedroom.
B002UXQRKW|5|My 6 month old daughter kept getting drowned by her sippy cups and I was just getting fusterated. One day at the grocery store I saw this sippy and figured I'd give it a try. She has used the NUK bottles since the day she came home from the hospital. I trusted this brand. I have a bunch of the bottles so i figured what's to lose. I handed her the sippy; she took it and did not choke or get too much. I did have problems finding just the sippy nipple, but found it online and ordered a bunch. This is a great learning product.
B000HKVG9C|1|I was pleasantly entertained by many of the reviews on this product and was looking forward to the arrival of this \\"Safety1st Outlet cover.\\"   However, when I tried it out, I was disappointed and wished I knew what I was getting before I ordered it.  Now that I have read more reviews, many of my concerns have been mentioned by others:  1. The maximum cord size is AWG 16/2.  That's typical insulated lampcord [as pictured on the box]. You won't be able to use a standard grounded cord with 3 wires.  That rules out your MacBook, your flatscreen TV, any self-respecting wire connected to a 3-pronged plug.  2. It's complicated.  I'm no slouch, but winding the cord and tucking it under the tab and holding it in place while snapping the outer cover over the whole mess of spaghetti is like trying to wind a pocketwatch from the inside out.  3. It's not reasonable for a frequently used device [laptop].  Winding your cord through tight turns is bad enough once, but the wear and tear on a cord to repeatedly route it under the tabs on the base plate is unsafe.  4.  It has a deterrent value of ONE SECOND.  If you route a AWG 16/2 cord as directed and close the cover over the baseplate and then apply a 10lb mass to the cord [away from the wall], the base plate bends and the cover pops off, exposing the partially removed plug.    That takes about one second.  I'm quick... but not THAT quick.    There is an accurate disclaimer on the box that reads: \\"CAUTION: This product is only a deterrent. It is not a substitute for proper adult supervision.  Discontinue use when your child becomes old enough to defeat it.\\"     Does your toddler weigh ten pounds or more? Can s/he pull on a cord? If so, s/he will be able to defeat it.    You may hear a faint 'click' when the cover pops off.  You may not.     *note: My particular model consists of a baseplate which mounts by way of a center duplex wall plate screw.  It has 2 \\"pinch\\" tabs but NO top tab.  The picture on the box shows a baseplate witha support tab on the top.  The cover has a raised \\"Safety 1st\\" logo without paint.  The model number on the box is 48308.
B00GQQVNP8|5|I got everything on time and it all fits great!!
B00TL68OCA|5|My Son and Daughter-in-law LOVE IT!!
B007BG2HKC|5|Everything I wanted in a 1st year calendar.  It has stickers and room to write on each day!  Very girly for your baby girl!
B00RP0GHBO|5|Very good
B000MEB3GE|5|If you really like routine this is great esp for the first few weeks when your mind is hazy. I did really rely on the &#34;L/R&#34; option at the bottom to remember which side we had last nursed on. It was also great for seeing how long between feedings and wet diapers (even if we didn't' end up waiting till the alarm to feed or change again.) It was also really handy to have the clock feature with me at all times so that I knew what time it was. Those first few months are so foggy, you need all the help you can get!
B010R1U7SG|1|VERY CHEAP! on only one in the box when is says 2, and 2 are pictured. SCAM SCAM SCAM
B00065H55W|5|I just returned to work almost 2 weeks ago and had purchased the Avent Isis. I have 2 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch. I was lucky if I was able to pump 8 oz during the day and my breasts were feeling engorged. It was very frusterating. I was able to return the Avent Isis and purchesed the Medela and already today on my first break it took me less than 5 minutes to pump 4 oz and I was amazed at how easy and comfortable it was!! I was really worried about my supply diminishing but now that I purchased the Medela I now have hope! This was definetely a smart purchase!!
B007HNUWTC|3|I bought this for my baby because I wanted him to have a non-toxic bath toy. It is really cute but I have to agree with other reviewers that it smells really bad even though I have been airing it out for more than 3 weeks. It smells so bad that I haven't given it to my baby and am not sure when and if I will.
B006P05SHO|2|Holds a ton of toys, but the plastic that holds the suction piece to the rest broke off with the suction still stuck to the shower wall. Not impressed!
B001NAAQP0|5|These are very soft and absorb a lot. Fit perfectly and so not show. I would recommend washing them before use.
B00QPQBZGG|5|Very soft and when put in the dryer they don't shrink like the other brands that I've bought.  They also don't need ironing.  They fit well and are a perfect size for my baby.
B003ZYE7F2|5|This is a great little set for I purchased for my one year old son.  The plates are a great size and he is easily able to drink out of the little cups.  The bowls are a great size.  They are sturdy and hold up well in the dishwasher and to everyday use.
B000OS8BP4|5|I love this. Our 3 month old had a really bad cold and was very congested. Being a first time mommy I couldn't stand to see her having a hard time breathing through her nose. My friend recommended that I get this and used with a nasal spray it works great! Now I'm out of control and I'm ALWAYS sucking her boogies out! THANK GOD FOR THE FILTER!
B006SFUEF2|5|My 4 month old soon love this thing. Between the projector and the different sounds it's amazing.  Puts my little colic child right to sleep.  Works great for adults as well. Love the ocean sounds.
B00ISS2JV4|4|I used to have the Recarro Pro Ride car seats for my kids but as they got bigger they had very little leg room.  I needed something a little smaller to fit in my small car, so I bought these.  They are working out pretty well, the kids have a lot more room with these seats.  My only complaint is that when my kids fall asleep in the car their heads fall forward now, instead of just resting back.  They don't seem to mind too much but they look very uncomfortable.
B002A9IZ0Q|4|Purchased this bed, very happy with it. No scratches, was easy to assemble. There was absolutely no smell to this bed. It stands right next to our bed and neither me nor my husband can smell anything. Its pretty sturdy. The only complain I have is that one of the screws was broken and I have to call and order one in. I definitely recommend this bed to friends if dont want to pay too much $$$$.
B003I86898|5|Great
B000WIPN66|5|the 1st gift to my girl~
B000CQGK74|5|This blanket is absolutely adorable and soooooo soft! My grandbaby's room was done in classic Pooh and this was the perfect touch! I highly recommend this product.
B003TJAGCG|4|I ordered a spare set of these diaphragms to have on hand in case my originals were damaged. Some reviewers received the diaphragms in a plain plastic bag and questioned their authenticity. I had no such problem ordering from Healthcheck Systems Inc. I received a Ameda brand package.<br /><br />Because these flexible membranes provide the barrier between the \\"wet\\" and \\"dry\\" sides of Ameda electric pumps, they are critical pieces. However, they are also made of thin silicone for flexibility, and therefore rather fragile. If one develops a hole, your pump will stop being effective. I wish they were made of a somewhat more durable material, but at least they are chemically inert silicone.
B0015H1D4E|5|Holds right amount for me
B0000482FN|5|Great
B00EWOOPXI|5|Absolutely adorable print.  Fits better and goes on easier than other toddler sheets ive pruchased.  Washes very well.
B00BSXTQEE|5|I found this product at a superstore (starts with W and is about 1/3 of the price Amazon is advertising) while looking for a harness to take my 14 month old to a festival.  I originally picked up a plush harness because that's all I thought they had but then I happened across this one.<br /><br />It's a parachutey-type material, which I prefer over the plush.  The aplix on the back allows for a snug fit.  I love that it will also work on a shopping cart.  I used that function today - put it over my daughter's head and then looped the belt through the cart seat and secured the aplix.  My daughter likes to stand up in the seat but was unable to do so, which made me feel a lot better.  Those cart seatbelts don't work very well (when they aren't broken)!  This gave me a wonderful feeling of security for my precious girl.<br /><br />The down side is the leash part connects on the bottom of the back instead of somewhere in the middle (this wouldn't be possible because of the design) so it sort of pulls up at the back when the child pulls against it.  I don't know how this compares to other harnesses, but it seems to work fine anyway.  It won't come off the baby since the belt part goes under the arms.<br /><br />I got the bear.  It is super cute.  I'd prefer something more girly but this one is fine and gender neutral.
B00GVZPF58|5|If people only realized that and acted accordingly,..wow...what a world this would BE
B00AV53YHU|5|So far my son is loving it! It weighs less than his glass bottles, even when full. He has taken to the soft spout very well and the whole thing is so easy to clean with no odors lingering at all. He even loves to chew on the travel lid! We love this bottle!
B00009VE5J|5|This cover was worth every penny of $40.00. Reversable and machine washable. With flu season coming, I couldn't imagine our family without it. I wish I saw more moms using this instead of seeing a tot teething on a bare shopping cart handle. BONUS: This even fits super large shopping carts like at costco or sam's club here in michigan.
B0049B3TD6|2|These did not do what I expected. They seemed to leak easily. They were good for the pool though.
B003ZFPRHS|3|Love this product but went through 3 in less than a year. Water tends to seep through and corrodes battery. Can't really change battery due to this problem.
B000F1QRII|4|We have both the Boulevard and the Companion and both of them have their advantage and disadvantage.      Yes, the seat is heavy and I do feel that it is a safe seat.  It is a perfect fit for an infant as well as a carry all.  I have not had any problems with the shade as it works keeping the sun away.  The cover is easy to clean as well as the material under the cover.     The price for the seats differ based upon the style of the cover.  If the cover is a newly released style, then the price will be higher.  Older styles are lower but from my understanding the seats are the same.  Therefore, you might be paying a higher price for a certain pattern and not the workmanship of the car seat which is more important. If you like a certain style of covering you can always purchase an extra seat cover of the style of your choice. Certain stores have certain patterns as all vendors do not carry the same patterns but again it is the seat cover that is the difference in the cost of the different car seats.  Before you purchase the car seat and you want to be certain that the workmanship has not changed, call customer service.  They helped me and I am sure that they will help you as well.     We did not have a problem with the baby getting too hot nor did we have problems with his head tilting as it was a perfect fit.  Other than the strap tangling, we have not had any problems with the car seat.    My problem with the car seat is the straps.  The straps are not tangle free as they are on the Boulevard.  If they were to add those straps to this car seat, then it would be a winner and that is why I gave it four stars.      However, I believe the car seat is a good and safe seat regardless of the hassles.  If I had to do it over again, knowing what I know, I would still purchase this car seat.  It is a winner even though trying to keep the straps straight wore us out.
B00L40SBAQ|2|Sorry, but this didn't work for us - and was not at all comfortable.  Appreciated the fact that it was returnable and refundable.
B00B7M7BN4|3|I liked this product, however, because of the trim around it I cannot put the window down when it's stuck to the window; I would've preferred to have something that was just the film without the fabric covering, but I couldn't find it.
B00F667QS2|5|Works just as expected. No complaints!
B00ILSIM58|5|I am thrilled with this roving wool----supersoft and definitely high quality. Received a very nice array of colors. can't wait to do some nuno felting with it! I will be buying again!!
B001F6L7ZA|5|These tiles are wonderful! I bought them when we first started physical therapy for my daughter. Her ability to sit independently is limited and she often falls over. We wanted something to help cushion the falls and would allow her toys (ones that roll) to be used as well. I researched several other brands and these were the thickest ones I could find. They are GREAT! The stay together very well, are soft enough that even adults are comfortable sitting on the floor, and have provided peace of mind for those unexpected tumbles. I highly recommend this companies floor tiles! I know they are a bit pricier than other versions, but are well worth the extra expense. I was given some of the thinner ones and they are not comfortable and don't provide enough cushioning.
B009ICN71K|3|My baby loves the crunchy noise this toy makes. His the most interested in chewing the two cloth pieces, like the baby in the photo!
B0054L4VB4|1|I don't know if it was defective unit but the accuracy was awful on it. +/- %50. The rule how much you'll pay for that much you'll enjoy it prove itself again. Will return it and get something better.
B00Q16V9DY|5|Love it
B002UWXHOC|5|Very adorable, great gift for mom :)
B004BFURFI|5|This cudly little lion was a perfect match to the taggie blanket that accompanied it.  Same pattern, and a perfect combination gift.  The patterns and taggies keep babys attention!
B001O9F6M8|5|i am pregnant right now and due is april 18. i bought this so that when baby is born he has a pillow already to use and not to have a flat head. i like it. its soft and comfy.
B00004YSZ5|2|My daughter loved the Winnie the Pooh T.V. but the bulb to wind up the toy kept breaking.  My daughter was only 6 months old when she had it so she was just looking at the T.V. I was the one winding it up.  We had two of these T.V.'s and both were the same.
B001H0GF0Q|5|this product is really cool, it arrived sooner than expected and I am very pleased with the product and services rendered. thanks guys!
B000OS3AP0|4|This was a bit annoying to attach, but once put on it works perfectly.  We've been able to exercise very comfortably with our 4 week old.  She is perfectly comfortable in the car seat (SnugRide), and the bouncing is absorbed well by the BOB's shocks - this was our only concern about using the stroller so young.  The main drawback is that the stroller can't collapse all the way, but it's such a great stroller that I didn't want to wait to use it and this is the perfect solution!
B008K0TNPK|1|Sadly this cute little pillow was SUPER stiff and way to thick to use in the car seat for my 2-3 year old as I had hoped.  Gave it away.
B0058O755G|5|Love it!!!!
B008R2KOEA|5|works great, we like it
B002QVGBP4|4|Love the print and the lightweight fabric! They're a good size for swaddling a baby past the newborn stage. These were great in the summer for covering the stroller when the sun hit the baby on a walk. Also worked well for tummy time. Price tag is steep, which is my only complaint. Would be much cheaper to buy your own cotton gauze and make some yourself if you're crafty.
B0043C5XYY|5|i got this one because i didn't want to use disposable nursing pad everyday. since i am planning to nurse him around 6 months or more, i decided this washable and reusable nursing pads would be a good choice. and it fianlly turned out well. it's very soft and hold the extra milk well. i wish i've got this earlier and i will recommend this product to anyone. i love it!
B00NFETB9Y|5|Very attractive mat. Real &#34;must buy&#34;, my son plays hours on that
B00003TL7P|5|This is a great diaper pail.  It seals really well so the smell is contained.  Unlike other diaper pails, this one doesn't require special bags so there is no additional expense.  It is also easy to use one-handed, which is important when you have a squirming baby on the changing table.
B003KMW4EA|5|a big fan of dr. browns products. this product meets those expectations
B0064DO9V8|1|Junk, complete junk. My kids, all under age 5, unlocked the window and then pulled the window up. Once it hit the safety lock, they pulled up and broke the plastic. This happened on all of them. The thin plastic on them breaks easily. These locks are fine if you have a 2 year old. But if you have a kid that can open a window, then they can definitely break these.
B00AMRF0R4|5|This is the most entertaining book from the time she could close her fingers around the pages with their crinkely texture and sound!!
B00A47J6Y0|5|I was on a business trip and saw this chair being used by a family in the dining area of the hotel.  They raved about it so I got one for our 1-year old.  Only a few weeks in our house and we absolutely love it!  Perfect to use if we go to dinner at friends or to visit family, not to mention at parks, the beach, etc.  Cleans easy, solid construction, lightweight enough. Would highly recommend it to any family that likes to be on the go.
B003I867US|4|This was perfect, I bought it for my husband and he carrys our three month old every where. The black and red design made it a simple enough pattern so that my 6ft 220lb husband still can claim his masculance while \\"wearing\\" his daughter. I definitely recommend the item. The only fault was I found the same item for the same price BEFORE SHIPPING at my local Target.
B0018CMQ7Y|5|I just love this bouncer and I haven't even used it yet. Looks much nicer in person. The red isn't so bright which is great. I love the way it reclines to hold a newborn and putting it together was a breeze. So far not a single bad thing to say about it.
B00AHPZZFI|2|It's very adjustable and has extra trays and folds away and everything but it is AWFUL to clean. My son is almost 2 and we've been using it daily since he was 4 months old. There are so many cracks and crevices and books and crannies that food finds it's way into. It's a pain. I absolutely hate it. We bought a high chair for our daughter for less than $50 and we love it. So cheaper chairs that are so much better are out there. Please save yourself from using everything from scrub brushes, tooth brushes and tooth picks trying to get food off of this chair. Pick another one
B003NSAY7A|4|PROS - We are impressed with this clip-on sunshade!  It is bendable to block sun virtually wherever you need it in your vehicle.  You do have to have front seat headrest bars, back seat roof handles, etc. to clip this onto in your vehicle though.  We use it to block the sun that shines through the windshield directly onto my 1 year old son in the back seat at certain times of day. Nice fold-up design also...    CONS - I think that the \\"bendy arm\\" could be more rigid so that it holds better where you put it, but overall it serves its purpose.  Actually, I would like two more of them for the back windows of my four door car so that I would have coverage when we turn into the sun while driving, etc.  Great product though... would highly recommend!
B000056HK2|5|This one is a bit more thicker than the other one changing pad and it was well worth it for $2 difference although I can't say for sure that my baby won't like the other one.  As for this one, my baby likes it so much that he rather sleep in this instead of his crib.   <br /> <br />This one has the screws to nail to the dresser altho I never used that since the pad doesn't slide.  Just don't leave the baby alone on there.   <br /> <br />I bought the Terry cover although it was slightly small.  The feel is awful but there's not another choice so I bought some extra large burp cloth to place it under the butt area.  So far it has worked really well since stain doesn't stick on the burp cloth as to the Terry cover.  I probably would buy some king pillow cases to see if that fits better. <br />
B001WAJVZM|5|This guys fantastic and he fit right onto my old outdated faucet. It will fit anything it looks like unless you have some new mod type faucet.
B008Y2DG8O|5|The pillow is very good, I liked the baby. Really good.I like。My baby every day asleep true pillow。It's really great
B00B4DD0MC|1|I'm usually a MAM fan. In fact it's the only type of pacifier my little guy has been using since the start. I decided to upgrade to the 6+ month, and I thought these &#34;air&#34; ones would be great. However-- they are much too big of a nipple. My guy is about 9 months and is not tiny either. These also irritated his skin on his chin from where the plastic part dug in. I would suggest the normal MAM pacifiers so the tension is evenly placed around our little ones mouth. Not these.
B00JKPUZV0|1|i have to enter dispute as they bassinet is not good quality; the bassinet when on stroller is titled towards head down and my child really feels uncomfortable.
B00F0T8WWE|4|This is the second one we purchased. it has everything that you need for your child(ren) grooming. Its a great neat gift.
B000T5PMZ4|2|It was oddly shaped, too short and I just couldn't figure out how to make it comfortable.  I just used a regular body pillow instead.
B00913CZWI|5|Great match for the Melamine plate set...great quality, and such cute owls!
B00JO5QBBO|4|😍
B00QHO2SLM|5|I received the booster seat guardian as a gift.  I really like how it holds the booster seat in place and keeps it from shifting around.  Even with the weight of my child in the seat, it tends to move a bit, so it's nice that the seat guardian helps keep it in place.  We haven't had any liquid spills, but the material seems like it would clean pretty easily with just a wipe down.  It also folds up and stores easily.  Really a nice product.
B002FB7FLY|5|I purchased these for my 17 month old toddler boy for overnights. We use prefolds with Thirsties Duo Snap covers mainly. At nighttime I just put in this hemp insert between the prefold and the cover. It works perfectly! He has had no leaks at all and sleeps for 10 1/2-11 hours overnight without a diaper change. In the morning when I change him, the prefold is not soaked at all, but the hemp insert is! I would definitely recommend this insert. I am getting a few pocket diapers soon, and I plan on using these hemp inserts as a doubler at nighttime in the pockets as well.
B004WG5F6M|4|Got this free through my insurance. I haven't used any other pump before so I have nothing to compare to. But here are my thoughts:<br /><br />-as far as what the main purpose of this is (to PUMP) I have no complaints. I get 6 oz in about ten mins of pumping while at work on my break from my crazy busy schedule<br /><br />-I received everything in the package necessary to pump (pump, tubing, bottles, etc) and haven't tried any other bottles to see if they are compatible. I just transfer my milk to a different bottle when I get home or freeze it right away.<br /><br />-I somehow misplaced one tube and was planning to order another but not sure how easy/cheap that will be from the sounds of other reviews but I'll post that when I find out!<br /><br />-I like that it is a small size- I just leave mine at work in a reusable plastic shopping bag<br /><br />-sometimes I wonder if the motor will go out someday since it it so much power in a tiny box but so far so good and I've used it about two times a day (only while at work) for a month.<br /><br />-Overall, it's been great. No complaints here.
B004NGJDSM|5|Looks great on my day care room walls, sent out in timely manner
B000F1OGCC|2|Bought this fir my preschooler and 7 month old baby only to read when received that it's not to be used with baby cause they may become entrapped and suffocate ... It should say this on the product description!!!
B002NGNF60|5|I still use these after a year. Built well. easy to clean. Seems like the liquid flows easy, but doesn't spill out when knocked over.
B001D1CO04|3|I really wanted to love this permanent place mat, because my son loves pushing his (fill in the blank) off the table, or whipping the entire place mat off the table magician-style (but without the cool trick of leaving the plates and silverware still in their setting), and I thought this would prevent said mischief. It does actually prevent liquid spills, and even discourages him from dumping everything in one fell swoop, but after one day he learned that he could simply pull the Stokke Table Top toward him and off the table (in conjunction with pushing off from the table in his Tripp Trapp, which allows him full room to drop anything). The suction cups are great for preventing anyone from lifting it perpendicular from the table, but offer zero resistance to a parallel pull--it slides like butter...<br /><br />Also, the surface has already gotten scratched up from only a week's use (albeit not simple dining use). Granted, better the scratches appear on the plastic place mat than my wooden table, but for $89 I had hoped for something more durable against the mad banging and smashing of a 7-month-old. I doubt he's going to get any gentler in the next couple of years!
B00G3XR9SO|5|Love this stroller! Super lightweight even with an infant car seat attached! Maneuverability is excellent! Great for strolling in the park in all kinds of terrain. Highly recommend this product!
B00OVSBY20|5|Great gift for a Great Granddaughter
B001P22Z2I|5|I bought this item for my daughters 1 st baby and she loves it.  it is very pretty and will fit her needs.
B00VWDTS7A|5|Great product!  Keeps the bugs out and our two month old sleeps great in it by the pool or on the beach.  We just keep in the shade and we have a little battery powered fan we put in there if there is not enough breeze.
B000FHS97Y|5|These are the best!  I was afraid to cut my baby's nails when the nail/skin finally separated.  These were recommended from a friend with 3 girls.  It works so fast, and smooth, my son hardly notices (and he is a mover).  The way they are designed, you really don't have to worry about cutting somewhere you didn't want to.
B00282DQMC|4|I was looking for some soft \\"toy boxes\\" for our basement.  These aren't huge and don't hold a ton of toys, but I bought two and they definitely work fine.  For the price, they were definitely worth it.  Nice soft top, good color and big enough to hold some toys.
B00M1MLV6C|5|Check around for a better price on this changing table. I really like the table for the price I paid.... which was under $50.
B000WPVCQE|1|I like the bottles, but the specs says that is low-flow nipples, and they arrived with medium-flow, not at all what I wanted! Bad advertising
B0045IH74K|5|This item was so perfect.  Lavender is the color and you can hardly find anything for babies in purple.  I would recommend this to anyone for their special little girl
B006Y7OS9M|5|Super cute, adorable, and durable for putting blankets, toys, or anything you can use as a storage piece in the room. Love the many animals you can choose from. This is a good size for storage. Also, you can flatten it when choose to put away which create more space to store.
B008J1QP7Y|5|She really liked this.
B0055ABONC|4|I bought this so that I could go to a theme park and not worry about who is taking off with my stroller. I loved having it! There are times when it is difficult to get the lock in, but other than that I think it is worth the purchase.
B00E00P1SC|5|Great price, great quality!  My 2 1/2 year old grandson couldn't wait to put his new back pack over his shoulders Christmas Eve!  He filled it with as many other toys as he could and walked around the rest of the night with it on!
B000XT30G4|5|This gate looks great.  Not something I would be ashamed to have guests see blocking off my hallway.  Installation was simple.  Very sturdy.
B000BMKEVC|5|This is a fabulous stroller. I am not crazy about the belt to clip, but otherwise it's awesome. I tell everyone to get one! I love the cup holders and how easy it is to fold down. It's very lightweight and easy to put in the car.
B001T7PO0Y|5|I have included many of these in various gift baskets I have created for my girlfriends for their baby showers. This makes for a great, unexpected, little surprise. My own son loved his blue version of this toy. P.S. The toy smells heavenly.
B00AGJFNCA|5|This mirror is awesome!  I did quite a bit of searching and read lots of reviews to find mirror that would allow me to see my entire backseat and both kiddos in carseats...this is it! It installed super easily and the clarity is great. Very happy with this mirror and would recommend it to anyone! I drive a mazda 3
B000056J8N|5|these are great. got them in 2009 for my son - never used as a diaper...  these came in handy in a bath, and when baby was falling asleep he would use it to cover himself . Now with my daugher I am using another pack of these - would recommend
B00GY8J8GO|4|looks nice and comfortable
B000YDKBT8|5|Really good product for my daughter, she's now a year old and I still use it on her!  I can see exactly what's happening in her room and I don't panic at night.
B00MUZVKY8|5|Excellent
B004X0WBHS|5|Good price and an awesome toy. I bought it when my son was two months old, now he is six months, and in between that time frame it has been neat to see him develop and play with it more and more. It's light weight and big enough for him to encircle his body around it and try to sit up or roll around with it. At six months he just loves the wheels on it and when I squeak the top of it.
B006Z2C032|4|Love the crib. The only problem was it came with no instructions to put it together....luckily it wasn't to hard to figure out.
B0043D28B4|3|Slightly disappointed that this is not a quiet book. Didn't realize that every page would be a crinkly page. Other then that, cute book.
B0091538FE|5|el producto llego a tiempo, en buena envoltura, como se indico en el anuncio, son unas sabanas muy bonitas para mi bebe
B0080AGNX0|1|Complete cheap bean bag. My son sat in it only a few times before it ripped -- and he is a total lightweight!!!
B004UOTWWY|3|I love these CB diapers (small), the ease of use, good absorbency, great fit, lovely colors, easy to clean. However this specific batch I received - 3 of the 6 diapers have incorrect and missing snaps. On two of the diapers, there are 3 snaps on the top left side and only 2 on the top right side. Another diaper has 4 on the left side and one missing below; the right side is fine. I'm not sure if its a quality control issue or if I received &#34;seconds&#34;. I've washed these 3 times am overall happy with them.. its just kinda stinky the snaps are messed up in half the order. I have a hand held snap machine at home, and may try to fix the one side so they fit proper as my baby grows.  I also have it these set in size Medium - those snaps seem to be fine.  Thank you.
B0043IS18I|3|My son distroyed one of the blue things in the first time he uses it.  very deliated. besides it use 2 aa and they do not last long
B008CMQTZI|5|Bought one at first for my granddaughter & ended up ordering another one so she wouldn't feel 'caged in'. I would recommend buying two sets to make a nice big play area. My son & daughter-in-law love it that my granddaughter can move around by holding on to the sides. Smart purchase.
B00OTXYEZQ|5|Love this set - my 2 1/2 year old hasn't seen it yet but it is lovely and soft with beautiful vibrant colors.  I know its gonna be a hit!
B004L2JJAK|2|rubbish! the mirrror is not clear... has a filmover it that scratches... and doesnt sit on the rest well.. useless
B00A4ENM5W|5|Juppy Baby Walker is an amazing product Moms have been dreaming of for years!  You'll surely love it and it will save many hours of back pain!  You can read my full review at [...]
B001V7QNPC|5|I ordered this product because my son grew out of his receiving blankets about a week after birth, but still fights sleep at three months unless he's been swaddled. I was using a fleece blanket (the only blanket that was not to big but not too small), but my son would sweat, so it wasn't an ideal situation. I swaddled him last night in the muslin wrap, and this morning, voila! No sweat, and he slept great. I didn't have to worry about him being too hot or too cold. My partner and I do a lot of backpacking and this is also a great camping blanket, since it keeps baby warm (on cool nights) and from over heating (on hot summer nights). The large size is one of the most appealing things about it.
B006L4C2L4|5|My baby has loved this since she was 4 weeks old! She is now 13 weeks and will stay under it for a good 30 minutes.<br /><br />The only con that I can think of is it does not store very easy (you can't just fold it up quickly and put away).<br /><br />Our baby LOVES the light and I love that the music is calming and not annoying like most baby toys.
B00HAZUJMC|5|This crib fits in all the small rooms of our house, a big improvement over the full sized pack & play.  Very easy to assemble, lighter weight, fits in the carrying sleeve, and is adorable.  Very happy with this product!  I only wish it had storage on the bottom like the bigger version.
B00JVOD4XG|3|Does not fit all cribs.
B000O7SR18|5|Great.  True to color.  Very soft!
B000056HKN|4|The sheets fit the pack 'n play pad well and do not slip off with a squirmy 5 month old.
B0069MDTD8|5|Bag is not overly huge but not to small either. had NO roblems with it.Very comfortable to wear. Of course this bag isn't made to please Everyone I will say it can withstand some tugging, pulling and plenty of spills. Easy to clean. And since I bought it for my wife she thought it was perfect. It suited our needs and most of the time I wear. And as you can see it's quite fashionable LOL. I have no problem wearing this. But now if it was pink and flowery.... ehhhh idk. But overall it's a great product. If your a dad and you know you'll be having it with you most of the time, Look no further.
B003C1Q1ZW|5|My daughter loves this piggy bank!  It is a nice size and is very cute.  It came well packaged with no chance of breaking in shipment!
B00ASI748K|4|What you get:<br />car seat (snugride click connect 30, ie up to 30 lb child)<br />car seat base<br />stroller<br /><br />We bought another (click connect) base for 2nd car. It was identical to the one included here.<br /><br />I thought it was ridiculous how much some systems are selling for. After doing a lot of research (pick a good safe car seat, consumer reports among others) we decided on this one. Time will tell but they look sturdy enough for hopefully 2 kids eventually.<br />The Finley color seemed gender neutral and it's nice.<br /><br />The instructions are bad in my opinion. The pictures are supposed to make thing clearer not worse. This is really nerve-racking because you don't want to make mistakes. For the base installation, I looked for Graco videos for this specific base and couldn't find it. There is a LOT of leeway for correctly leveling the base. It has a color indicator but every position I tried gave me a blue (good) indicator. I researched it and apparently you aren't supposed to trust the level indicators. One book says to cut a piece of paper 45 degrees and put that on the back rest of the seat and the top of the paper should be level (back rest should be 45 degrees), ugh frustrating.<br /><br />The stroller was easy to assemble (even with the bad instructions) and it rolls smoothly. I was worried the wheels would be too small (I didn't see it in person until it arrived), but the wheels are good.<br />The &#34;FastAction Fold&#34; is pretty good. It's hard to find videos that show how to unfold it (probably because it's not as fast). To fold you just yank on the handle in seat. That's it. To unfold, pull on the same handle and lift up on the push-bar but you may need to hold the wheels down with your foot (not as elegant!).<br />It takes considerable force to unhook the child cup holders (I keep thinking I'm going to break the plastic lever I have to pull on under the cup holder tray.<br /><br />The seat clicks on the stroller with no additional straps needed.<br /><br />The buckles on both stroller and seat are hard to push but I'm sure that's by design.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Yes. It works and the price isn't ridiculous.
B00CYJ5PD2|5|Beautiful! Thanks
B006CFCNDO|4|My mother is visiting and we had to set her up downstairs as she was unable to use the stairs.. Worried about not hearing her if she need help in the night I thought of my old baby monitor and ordered this. Perfect. This model is pretty quiet unless there's a sudden noise and along with transmitting the noise, makes an annoying buzzing sound so that if she coughs or calls out, and I'm sleeping,  the buzzing  wakes me.
B00A4ENLB2|5|I loved it.<br /><br />Didn't hurt my back.<br /><br />Just my arms :)
B000YQMWLU|4|4 weeks ago, I had my baby girl and immediately had problems getting her to latch correctly as this is my first. This caused me to have cracked, blistery looking nipples that were so painful I would cry every time I had to breast feed her. I tried the medium nipple shield in the hospital that was given to me by the nurses, but I felt that it was way too big to fit in my newborns mouth so I decided to trash it. I went on Amazon here and purchased the small which fit my nipple and her mouth a lot better. At first she didn't want nothing to do with this plastic contraption and fussed quite a bit before she finally got the hang of it. I found that squeezing my breast to get a little bit of milk inside the shield helped her latch onto it and keep a latch. I do find that it's sometimes a pain to keep on if the breast gets too wet from the little ones slobber, like it will move and cause the milk to spill out before she gets it all.
B00HDM3VXG|4|Really nice and soft.  I agree with the other reviews that say these are a little bit thin, in material, however, it more than makes up for it in comfort and softness.  Would have like if there was also a neutral yellow color, mixed in with this set, but overall a really nice set.
B003KTLYHQ|5|Works great on my summit x3 double which has limited accessories. I did move the brake to make it fit better.
B002ZYM3MW|5|I was looking for a hands-free pumping bra that was more fun than the beige ones they sell in stores.  This bra is exactly what I was looking for!  It is cute and stays on nicely.  I like that the closure is a lot like a bra - it makes it easy to fit no matter how full I am.  I haven't tried washing it yet, so I can't comment on how it holds up in the laundry.
B00BFEUM3A|5|Daughter said her 6 mo old son, who's teething big time, loves to chew on cold things in this.
B004BSFOJY|5|I received this as a gift for my 4 month old daughter, and it quickly became her favorite.  It's light enough that she can pick the whole toy up herself, and she loves to chew on the dog's ears.  The tags are nice for developing her fine motor skills.  I liked it so much that I ordered a back-up!
B00D3EWJQI|5|I bought this as an add on camera to the Lorex BB4325X bundle with the PTZ Camera, Wifi Cradle and Handheld monito.  See my review of that product for more details.
B00ASK7SKC|4|We have another Bebek trainer cup that is awesome!  This one seems to lose its plug more often abd therefore leak.  Overall though we like these cups abd would probably buy another one.
B001PTGPYA|5|My 3 year old granddaughter LOVES this step stool.  She's really tiny 4 her age.  She uses it 2 get on the toilet & in front of the sink 2 wash hands, brush teeth, etc. ;)
B00CA68V44|4|This is a beautiful, thoughtful gift for my new grandson due in June.
B007PK4M34|5|Worked great for a great price!  I would definitely purchase again.  My tube ends were magenta colored and not yellow, but it didn't affect the quality or operation of the product.
B0000DH5TU|3|I have this monitor and have no trouble at all with static or humming sounds, in fact I think the sound is very clear and works well.  This is our second monitor, for our second baby and the reason I don't rate it higher than 3 stars is because the lights are very bright in a dark room in the middle of the night.  They are great during the day when I can check them from across another room but the monitor in our room looks like an airport in the middle of the night, I wish you could turn the lights doen like you can the sound.  The other reason I don't rate this very high is the fact that you can't put batteries in the base unit.  This was a problem this moring when I woke up and we had lost power at some point in the night, the monitor near the bed works because it has batteries but the one in the babies room doesn't so I had no way of hearing her.  I don't know how I didn't notice that during the set up but it doesn't make any sense that the listening monitors have battery power yet the base doesn't!  That is why I am writing this, it wasn't something I noticed until you need it but our poor baby was crying away and because our room is on another floor we had no way of hearing her.
B0028K2RNI|5|Seriously. We purchased a high-end mobile for one of our twins. It was cute but standard. THIS mobile is awesome. It moves in two different directions, and has 3 different songs, along with just the ocean sound if you want. I wish I had gotten 2 of these! I can't believe it's so cheap! This is the one you want!
B00IJEYFSW|5|Looked adorable on my great niece on her Christening Day!
B00FEFSYJA|5|Amazing. I will keep rebuying these as long as I need to
B004044LD4|5|This top-ranked crib mattress did not disappoint me. It is at a low-range price, but has satisfactory quality. I like firm mattress more than a soft one, and this mattress happens to meet my requirement.
B00L2FPBXS|3|Super cute necklace.  Great colors. Perfect fit. Problem is the amber started cracking and breaking off in the first week.  Choking hazard issue when the amber falls off onto the floor.
B000XA6DC6|5|I have a Britax Convertible that this fits perfectly into.  In the past I would ask airline for a bag but I have been running into airlines no longer having them available.  Decided on this one because it had wheels and other reviews saying there was extra room to stuff items into and yes it does!  Canvas is very durable and wheels are nice solid rubber.  The last thing I wanted was to strap something to my back and I am glad I went with this one.  We stuffed beach toys and towels in with the carseat on our last trip and it was perfect.  I highly recommend for convenience and durability.  I see this bag holding up really well over the next few years!
B00KZBXTWU|5|Loved how easy this swaddle was to put on my baby. And the air vents on the side were nice - not too big either. My baby gets warm when he sleeps (at least to me!) so I feel better having him in one layer and the vents are a bonus. Definitely a lot easier to use than other swaddles with lots of wrapping and tucking.
B0036ZSVWU|4|I really liked how comfortable the kneeling pad is.  Works great when bathing the kids and  cleaning the tub. Thanks
B000PKXBRY|5|I have a two story house and bought this basket so I didn't have to run up and down the stairs all day to check on my napping newborn.  It is fabulous!  I keep it downstairs so my son can be in the kitchen or family room with me.  He sleeps very comfortably in it, it looks great, and the price was right.  An extra bonus--my daughter can use it for her dolls when my son outgrows it!  I would definitely recommend this product.
B004DIUAB4|5|I love the color, it is vibrant and fun.  We get so many compliments that no one has ever seen such a bright seat.  The interior is incredibly soft and our son seems to love the comfort!  The handle is a little awkward when carrying it so I usually carry it with my forearm...which leads me to the one thing - the weight of it.  Its a big seat, bigger than most I think.<br />One thing I did read in the reviews before buying, that I expected and now know since using - the weight, especially with a 12 week old, 12lb baby!  Just make sure you have your snap n' go ready!  ;)<br /><br />Awesome seat and worth every penny!  4 1/2 stars!!!
B005GL82Y4|4|Its Heavy duty, tough, and long enough for my energetic toddler. Havent heard anything from daycare that it doesnt work well
B00005CARW|5|Very convenient, but the price can add up after a while. We have the nurser set and the vent-aire set.<br /><br />********************************************************************************************************<br />It has been 9 months since I wrote my initial review (above). Now that my husband and I were able to try something else, I realized that the Parent's Choice liners (from Walmart) feel a bit sturdier. These are still great, but the others are cheaper and feel like they are higher quality. We didn't have to buy too many of them, since my son was ebf; he only drank from the bottle when I was at work (expressed milk). It saves time since it is just one less thing to take care of. Works really well with the pumping adapters.<br /><br />Used this to pump milk into, along with Playtex Drop-Ins System Breast Milk Storage Kit. It was so easy and really convenient. Would definitely recommend to others. This may honestly not work as well for you as it has for me if you are formula feeding. The measurement readings do not seem to be very accurate. The times I pumped into the Medela bottles instead of these, I saw a significant discrepancy in the measurement readings between the two. This will say you have more than you actually do, so formula may end up being too concentrated.
B005JCPKTK|5|I just received my stroller today and could not be happier with my purchase!  The assembly literally took 10 minutes max!  The car seat snaps right in to the stroller (thanks to the car seat adapters that come with the stroller).  I purchased the red set and it looks just as beautiful as it does in the photo.  The stroller can easily be closed with one hand and is very compact, which is a relief as I know that when I take baby out and about I won't have to fuss with things more than I have to.  I priced this product locally (car seat and stroller) and cost would have been $450+ (given I live in Hawaii, everything is overpriced which is to be expected).  I was ecstatic to find this system for $311 TOTAL, and Amazon shipped this to me in 2 business days with the free shipping!  I can't imagine things haven been better than this!!  I look forward to using this stroller with our upcoming bundle of joy.  Definitely would recommend this to any parent looking for a travel system for baby.
B000GLRNT4|2|We received this bed as a gift for our toddler.  When it arrived the box was torn and tattered with pieces of the bed, as well as hardware hanging out of it.  I will look past that when reviewing the wuality of the item as it's likely not the manufacturer's fault.  However, the one piece of the bed hanging out was NOT right.<br /><br />We had ordered the \\"cognac\\" color.  When ordering online I expect some variation in color as it's difficult to tell with monitor calibration and what not.  Before we ordered I checked out the color on my laptop, desktop, phone, as well as my work computer for good measure.  On all computers it looked perfect.<br /><br />Well, it arrived today and this isn't even close to what's pictured for cognac.  It looks just like the \\"cherry\\" color.  It's considerably darker and also much more red, just like cherry.  My invoice does state \\"Stork Craft Soom Soom Toddler Bed, Cognac\\" so unless the wrong product is in the box, their picture is way off.<br /><br />I will keep this as a 2-star review until this is settled and I can get the bed put together for the main purpose that one has to be able to trust the photos of products sold online and if one cannot, then that's not acceptable.
B00005TN7O|5|I would not give this up for the world. The bag is awesome. It really was warm enough for my one month old. It was cool and windy today and the nano bag held up to its word.  My son stayed warm and did not feel the elements of the wind. I would recommend this bag to anyone. My sister also recommended this bag as well!!
B000ZX6XA8|5|I will give these a good review because Dr. Browns products are great but my babies didn't use them. I ended up having to return them.
B00E4WMYLI|5|I bought soooooooo many props for my photobooth and party favors as well, but this is the one everyone loved most.  Get it!
B000A88JZU|4|I use these at work to wipe my accessories down after using the pump. They can be used for just about anything, but are pricey, so I like to save them for when it's absolutely neccessary. The product description of this does not tell you the quantity, but this is the larger economy size, and should last you awhile.
B0043RQJQU|3|Difficult to figure out how to put on
B00KLO5F78|5|We've been using the stroller organizer for about 5 weeks now and my husband and I both love it. There's enough space for two water bottles and the fabric is easy to wipe. There's a nice pocket for snacks and a place for your cell phone. The zip purse can come in handy. I like how there's extra storage if needed, and how it folds away nicely. Only drawbacks are the straps are a bit large for my personal taste, and the drink pocket is a little deep for a &#34;tall&#34; Starbucks drink to fit without the lid catching. However I usefulness highly outweighs these minor complaints.
B00FWRR8W4|5|My baby loves this ball! She wanted it stright out of the box! Just the right size to grab and suck on. It smells nice too. I would buy again!
B00008ODBG|1|I hate this product.  Not only do you have the maintenance of always having to keep the pad wet (trust me, you don't think about that until it has already dried your wipes out), but when it is wet and working, it makes the wipes TOO moist!  It's just supposed to warm them, but moisture builds up in it and makes the top wipes way too moist.  Now that I have it and it's opened, I'm just using it to hold my wipes, I'm done with plugging it in.
B00BMTKPZS|2|The package was not appropriate. It came in a cheap tube that did not protect the decal. The tube was bent in several parts, which affected the decal's ability to stick to the walls. The decal would fall off the wall after a minute of putting it. I had to use an additional clear glue to help it stick.
B008SV8UIC|5|Supreme quality! Even more beautiful in person! It is extremely plush and looks luxurious in person. Very happy with my purchase!
B003XMWFBE|2|bought this because i am veryyy ocd about my cars' cleanliness and organization, thought it would be a good organizer for my daughters sippy cups and books and snacks,,annoyed when I first tried to put it on my passenger, really had to play with the straps to get it to fit around the bottom,,my boyfriend had to,, strap really doesnt irratate whoevers sitting in the passenger seat, overall, its a good idea yet the quality of the material is very flimsy and cheap and the sippy cups, bottles, books,snacks, etc are constantly falling out and not fitting right,, looks a little cheap too
B00D04R3LW|5|Reaserched for months before I purchased for my very tall 3 year old. Carseat has highest height for harness use out of competitors.  Very happy with look, style fit. I have mini van and it fit perfectly.
B004S8MGHU|5|It is hard to pump double sides without a hands free bra, this bra did the trick and works perfectly and is easy to adjust as you get smaller or bigger.  While nursing, I'm a 40F, and the XL size is a great fit. As I lose weight, I just tighten the band.
B004QQMYAI|5|This lettering was prefect for my Dr. Seuss Nursery. Easy to put up and very durable vinyl lettering. The plain black makes it veery versatile.
B0051RIELY|3|This is very cute (I did actually get most of the room setup too and they are all well matched and equally adorable) I love it for display however I am hesitant to use it for serious use. my reason is that after only 3 or 4 times of her sleeping with the comforter the threads are starting to come out of the design. I've decided to turn it into a wall decoration for her room rather than risk her unraveling all the threads or getting a finger entangled in thread. Luckily we were gifted many blankets as well, but if this was to be your only blanket --consider durability over cuteness...But if you can just do cuteness this is definately tops and Ilove the pattern--I looked all over for classic pooh bear and amazon was the only place I could find it!
B00J0YTS1E|3|Love the Owl itself, however when you pull the cord the music does not play properly, sounds wound down and broken every time, not impressed
B000056J8C|4|I really like this drying rack.  It holds 8 bottles and has little compartments where I can dry the shields from my breastpump and stack bottle caps.  I wish it was a little bigger though!
B004CLBX8G|4|The gate installed fast. After reading several other reviews, I decided (even before install) that I would use wood screws that I purchases from the hardware store. I did receive a black gate even though the picture shows white. I'm going to get more.
B002VLW9XM|4|These are great. Great for napkins, great while cooking and cleaning up the counter. Perfect for all but the nastiest messes.  Paper towels do have their place, after all. These are not ultra, ultra absorbent like the old Linens and Things kitchen towels I have that are called flour sack towels, but they're close. I'm gonna keep on the lookout for the smaller size baby diapers, that have a wider mesh and are absolutely as absorbent as a paper towel. But still much, much better than using paper towels.
B00D6N22YU|5|Wonderful for hot weather! !
B004GFIW28|1|I ordered this to replace my original cariboo mattress - what I received was a cheap piece of foam - less than an inch thick - covered in a cheap plastic cover that looked like it was sewn together by a drunk blind person.  The little cover you see doesn't exist, or doesn't come with the mattress.  I do have to say that Amazon was really easy to communicate with & made the return process as pleasant as possible.
B003CJFED4|5|Great for an easy wall decoration! Looks great on my wall. It is a one time use though.
B00GSP5CNQ|5|LOVE!!! LOVE!! LOVE!
B00PTL6VLC|2|Maybe my children are just super chewers. My son is autistic, and my daughter is missing part of her brain. Together, they managed to chew right through those valves in about 2 weeks. They drip, they stream, one is even completely chewed off. I'm open to suggestion if anyone knows a soft top sippy that my autistic baby can use that can take the abuse of his chompers!
B002ZYNTO8|5|I have been pumping pretty much non stop for the last 16 months.  when pumping 4 times a day every day, having your hands free is just a must.  I found this comfortable, easy to use, accommodating of my very well endowed size with no real issues.  It can hold 2 full 6oz bottles with no problems.   I did find the organic tended to stretch out a bit more and not bounce back as well, which makes sense as it is cotton.  After about a year or more of usage the microfiber one has stretched a touch (but i will admit I probably dont' wash it as often as I should to help it bounce back) - but even slightly stretched out it works fantastically well.   At a 42H i was even able to use a size Large in a pinch, stretched to fit, and it still held the horns just right.   best hands free out there in my opinion.
B00C6CS8PE|5|Oooooooh it' s even prettier! in real life...smile...just a sweet and clear looking print and it just makes your heart feel warm!...smile...alllll the kids that see it just love it and want one.....it's for allll children!...smile...so do not hesitate! to buy one...smile.
B00F18FMZ4|5|Great value and product
B001QU25K6|5|Purchased as a gift for my two year old grandson and he really loves it! Another Lil People hit! Thanks!
B0002VAF3Y|5|Our baby's bed is a twin size bed but with only one mattress, seems that these rails are made to be put between two mattress (like box) and not in a wood bed, anyway, we cut the piece that allows it to move it and make it firm and permanent, for small babies is fine, now that she is growing up wants to stand and watch over it... thanks God I allready tought her how to get down from the bed in order to take away the idea of jumping the rail.<br />I will recommend it, good quality, nice price/nice product.
B00PJRBUEY|4|I cant say anything bad or great about this pillow since my grandson uses it. I bought it since it was recommended by chiropractors. I do use a pillow case cover and I have not washed it.  It feels a little lumpy to me as I prefer a down pillow.
B001OC5UMQ|5|Great price. Nice looking. Easy set up. Great for use with pets or children. Can be fixed permanently in place with four screws or set up with compression only making it easily portable, if desired. Good value.
B00P8ELNTK|3|Size is good.  Pretty much like all the shades I have bought.  Doesn't really stay on window long.
B001H9NUBO|5|bright, cheery and fun.
B004JU0CFU|4|Bought this cover for our son who has terrible eczema.  Pediatrician suggested that the synthetic fabrics in carseats and strollers might irritate sensitive skin. We have a chicco infant carseat and this works great contrary to what other reviewers suggested.
B00AJF7S6A|5|My daughter is 5 montys old and really not into sucking the pacifier but loves chewing on it. The teddy and the tiger she prefers more than the caterpiller bc she can put the arms in her mouth easier. Easy to wash bc you just put in a laundry bag and wash.
B000I2Q0FE|5|I bought this for our three month old granddaughter for her to play with when we babysat but she loved it so much it went home with her and we had to buy another one to stay at grandmama's and granddaddy's house.
B00LVPJCNE|3|Works as described. The only problem is the handle replacement is very bulky and heavy. If you want to use one car seat only and not to use the stroller with the extension, you can easily replace the handle. So you are stuck with the large handle, even if you are using it for one car seat.
B00BV0EP22|5|My son loves to shake his cups upside down to spill water out but nothing comes out with these cups! They also have really held up and seem to be durable as he throws them all the time. These would not be good for a beginner straw user as it's harder to suck from than others, but my 16 month old son has no problem with it.
B004U5FQJ6|5|Cute then, cute now. My toddlers love their skip hop zoo lunch bags! Held up well for over a year and still going strong! Would definitely recommend!
B009WKC264|2|Like the other reviewers, this product looks great but did not stick without an additional application of glue. I used an Elmer's gluestick and a month later, the tree is still up.
B00KAMHLPA|5|Without a doubt, this is the most amazing detergent I have ever used.  I was skeptical at first; but, after using it exclusively for 2 months, I remain amazed at the condition of my clothes, towels and linens.  Everything is soft, smells 100% fresh and natural, no &#34;filmy&#34; residue and the whites are whiter than ever - which I thought would not be possible.  I have not had skin allergies; but,t have noticed that even living in a very dry climate, my skin is not as &#34;dry&#34; as before?  Hard to explain this one, but true.  Additionally, my nicer clothing, especially natural fabrics, are not showing the &#34;usual' wear-and-tear.  I highly recommend this product - based on my personal experience and observation.  I will never use anything else.
B00FE8BEJE|5|When I first opened this, I didn't think that it would give as much padding to our portable crib as it did.  It washes up beautifully and makes it that much more comfortable for our little one.  It also fits our Evenflo portable crib as well as our Pack 'n Play.
B00DDTXVHY|5|It was very cute my daughter loved it
B005LAJF32|1|My hubby asked me why we needed to buy \\"baby\\" wash clothes instead of just using our own and I told him it was because they were supposed to be much softer on baby's delicate skin. These do not fit the bill. They are rough and super thin. I would've been fine just using our own which are nicer. Shouldn't have bothered with these.
B0006FHBBA|5|The best bottle ever :) my child love eat with this bottle.
B000JFEV1K|5|Incredible invention. Just for 8 dollars your life gets a lot easier. I find the mechanism safe and easy to operate as well. Don't overload it though.
B000M4K4BY|1|This swing could barely move with just the car seat in it and wouldn't move at all with the baby in the car seat. Forget about it if you have other kids running around the house as well, it's the perfect height for little hands to poke the baby!
B008X6RGZA|5|We have about 20 of these. Easy to clean. We removed the inside plastic so it is not spill proof, but at least it is easy for him to suck water from.
B00ATLI7QO|5|It's very sturdy. We've never had an issue with my daughter tipping it over. She loves that it's light enough that she can carry it from room to room by herself.
B000HIP38Y|1|Didnt' last very long. Tried changing battery. Won't work anymore.
B001DK876U|5|My baby loves it and that's all that matters. Plus it's safe, soft, comfortable, easy to set up and clean. So far so good.
B0016ZX7AI|4|We have a 5 year old who really did want to stop sucking his thumb.  This really did the trick to help remind him about it.  It did take a good two weeks to really sink in and change the habit and he still sometimes wants to suck his thumb but he remembers and stops himself.  I would recommend this for sure.
B006PB2EXO|5|It is a gift.
B00674S1Y0|4|This is very well made (especially for the price) and fits nice and snug in the toilet. The handles are great to give them a little more stability. My only complaint is that for boys I have to push their junk down towards the water or pee ends up getting everywhere. My son has quite a stream. Don't have this problem with other training potties that have a higher guard.
B00832U5R0|3|This brush is okay, could be more thickly bristled. I paid too much, saw the exact same brush for $1.00 at the dollar store. I doubt I would buy this same brush again because I need more diverse sizes but if you only need a bottle brush and nipple brush it is okay.
B003VP435Y|5|This was perfect for the Christmas letter and at such a great price!!! To clear up any confusion there was when I ordered (there was no definitive answer on how many sheets there were) there are 100.
B005JN6304|5|We bought two of these (matte bronze) and love them.  It is very clean looking and goes with most any decor/look.  It is set up so the vertical bars are always even (none will be offset) and the screws that go into the wall mounts can go in and out to get it to the right width.  I don't really love having to have the screws almost all the way out on one of our stairs, but I would like it less if the vertical bars had to be offset, so I'm not sure there's a way around that.  My husband did have some trouble getting the wall mounts installed in the correct position & level, had to redrill a couple times but all of the extra holes are covered by the hardware still, so ended up not being too big of a deal.  I would buy these again!
B003CUSJAS|5|works great
B0000A1O7P|4|Purchased them for our 11 month old twins, 18 pounds. Work nice but have had trouble fitting under table certain tables. Which it would work with most. Now looking for alternative at Grandparents without needing regular highchairs.
B00913CZ5A|5|very nice, got the back pack and lunch bag, my 2 year old preschooler loves them, it's been almost a year using them, very good quality, nice design, perfect zippers
B000I2Q0F4|5|So I bought this for my daughter a month ago she just stared at it haha but now that she's 3 months she loves it keeps her occupied for store trips. It has different sounds shapes colors and textures for babies development which is awesome it has a squeaker and crinkles and rattles its made very well and by far the best toy we have gotten her its actually very large as well! I enjoy this brand and would buy it again! I think this is a must for development!
B00HAZSBIG|1|In theory this would be a great toy, but it hardly blows any bubbles and the motor is hilariously loud! I thought maybe it was my bubble solution that was the problem but I've tried several and this thing only blows maybe one bubble for every 20 rotations. My son got impatient with it so it's in the trash now. Waste of money. So unfortunate since I have several other Munchkin brand items/toys that are good. This toy is an embarrassment to their brand.
B007QQFN58|4|I had been looking for a horse crib bedding set for my little boy and I couldn't find anything until I looked into amazon they offer the best price because other websites sell it too for a higher price, I am glad I found it here for less!!
B001NPD72Y|5|Our 3 year old loves her \\"big girl seat\\"!  My husband watched the installation video online and it was a breeze to install.  It is VERY secure and I feel confident that our daughter is safe in her seat.  Our third Britax and we love it!!
B00AJSIXUM|5|My daughter loved the bright pink color and we loved the seat. We liked it so much we bought 2 more for our other car and one for Grandma!
B0064QLRTW|2|Before purchasing this item, I did quite a bit of research into what material it was made of.  I especially wanted to avoid PVC, a.k.a vinyl (which many sun- and rain-proof stroller shields are made of), because PVC usually contains phthalates and emits harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs), especially when exposed to bright sunlight and/or heat.  However, the most my research turned up was the product description on B.O.B.'s website stating that the sun shield was \\"nylon mesh.\\"  So I went ahead and ordered it, thinking that it must by PVC-free.  Plus, it's made by B.O.B. specifically for its strollers, so there would be no issues with the sun shield fitting the stroller incorrectly, etc.  Well, imagine my dismay when the sun shield arrived and I discovered that was made not only of nylon, but also of PVC.  Granted, as B.O.B. states on the product packaging, it is phthalate-free PVC.  But phthalates are only one of many reasons that PVC is a less-than-safe choice, especially for products aimed at babies and young children.  Phthalate-free PVC/vinyl can still contain dioxins (a carcinogen), VOCs, and lead & other heavy metals.  Worse still, heat and humidity can increase the release of these chemicals, which makes (even phthalate-free) PVC particularly ill-suited for a sun-shield!  It practically goes without saying that I'll be returning this product.  The sun-shield was a wonderful idea by B.O.B. for its outdoor jogging strollers, but until they replace the PVC with a safer alternative, I'll have to pass.
B002KCMSPQ|4|These changing pads are very useful and handy. I also use them as a sheet protector for my newborn once in a while. You don't have to throw them after every use, only if they get dirty, that way you can use them for a few weeks before disposing them. I have taken away a star because they are little expensive I'd prefer to get a few more for the price.
B002TUTPCI|5|It works very well with graco infant car seat. it protect my kid from wind, rain and sun. We also light the light weight. we have it for 20 months and put about 100 miles on it but still works great. it's made of plastic though.
B002LQ00OW|5|nice to have even though they are too tight
B004RP6FNA|3|It looked pretty cheap, I wouldn't recommend buying it as a gift, I got it for someone's new born baby, and it just didn't look that great.
B00EAC8F74|2|In the description it says this is the Potette Plus, but it is NOT! We purchased this b/c the description said \\"Potette Plus\\", showed a Potette, and my daughter loves the color green! The photos and description are misleading.  This little potty chair is a travel potty that folds flat, about the diameter of a small dinner plate and about 2 inches thick.  The legs pop up to raise the height to about 4 inches, and they hold a bag (no absorbent part)in place for the waste to go.  However, the legs do not pop out to allow this to be used on an adult toilet as the Potette does (and photos indicate).  I can't give this a poor review b/c it probably isn't a bad little potty.  But is also isn't what's shown on the item's description either.  Just be aware it cannot be used on an adult potty!  We'll be sending it back.
B002QYW8LW|4|Great tool
B00948PMPW|5|Got this for my grandbaby boy.  We have cold winters and<br />this flannel sheet is very nice...warm and comfortable for<br />him to sleep upon.  It fits nicely on his crib mattress and<br />washes up great.  This is the second one purchased for him.<br />Cars on it are so cute....first one had circles....colors are great.<br />His mommy likes it very much also.
B005GG7VHI|5|So much better than sleepsacks and other baby sleeping-bag products that we have tried.  Would recommend the style that has the snaps on the shoulders - much easier to get on and off.
B00LV8N3RC|1|i didn't work, like at all, had to return it, would not recommend the WiFi setup directions are extremely difficult to follow and even if you do figure them out, its still not connecting to your network as it says it should.
B0006BAJN6|5|LOVE these to clean the bottles - and most especially my breastpump parts as well!  Helps to get into the little nooks/crannies.  Nice product which serves its purpose.
B009YXFWDY|1|I will learn one of these days to read the measurements, way too small to learn any thing. What happened to the big ones, this was all I could find and was happy to find it to only be disappointed at the size
B00BUBNZAK|1|It is too large than needed. Its fabric isn't good as seem in the picture.
B00FZGLKPI|2|This bag was great. I love the mesh pocket. I put a change of clothes and diapers in it. However, like other reviews stated even if you wash it on cold and then line dry it the plastic gets weird. And the bag is already coming apart at the zipper. Poor quality fabric. It's a bummer because I really like the bag. I use it all the time but now it's falling apart and my son is only 2 months old. Really disappointing. Also the snap strap isn't strong enough to stay snapped while I'm holding it which is really annoying when you have it around your wrist and it just falls off.
B000LXQVA4|5|After an extensive search for jumper for my daughter, I decided to buy this rain forests jumper by Fisher-Price. My baby thoroughly enjoyed her new within one hour after the jumper was assembled. My six month old daughter uses it everyday. It's worth every dollar. This is one of my favorite purchases for my daughter so far. Highly recommended.
B00PHQ1LIC|5|No more digging in with a qtip and praying that you've gotten all the gunk out only to go back at another point in time to see that your dinky little nasal aspirator is black on the inside!  I am so overly happy about this purchase that I bought the smaller one for a friend who is due with a baby boy next month.  She squealed, &#34;IT COMES APART!!&#34;<br /><br />Thumbs up for this bad boy.  He may be bigger than the ones you are used to, but that just makes it all the better and easier to clean. :D
B00L8JIO4G|5|I ordered this product to keep my dogs away from my gym.  It is well made, material is made of steel and wood.  The best part, it is not an eyesore.  Looks elegant.
B00849L490|4|Serves it's purpose!
B009YSYCZS|5|all came in good order with no visible flaw or damage. Wife loves it.
B00T8VQ4AW|5|I am a huge fan of any baby items that can &#34;grow&#34; with your child due to the amount of items on the market with a very short lifespan but high price tag.  I feel that this is an investment worth recommending not only because my daughter likes the projection star show but because it can be set on a table once the baby is too old for a crib mobile.  The mobile can then be detached and reattached to the stroller and the projection feature can continue to be used in the toddler years.  This is a very unique feature.  The included remote is a nice touch so that you do not have to disturb your baby.
B001T7TN2E|5|Our baby loves this toy and it soothes him when his gums hurt.    To address some of the other reviews:  -Yes, it is loud and squeaky - it is a squeaky toy.  -Yes, it smells like rubber - it is made out of natural rubber  -Yes, the coloring does come off eventually - like they state on the box, it is food paint  -No, it is not a dog toy...and if you expect it to cost $0.69 like a dog toy, then it would be made in China out of synthetic materials.
B00AM5NTIS|3|I was just saying that \\"someone\\" should invent a reusable food pouch. I'm so tired of spending a dollar (on sale!) on the grocery store pouches. I'm really excited that the \\"someone\\" turned out to be two moms in California.<br /><br />Follow the directions and really blow on the spout to get the pouch to open up. Fresh out of the box it looked like the pouch was more of a flat bag. It wasn't until after I had hand washed the pouch and was playing around with it to fill it up that I got the whole bottom to open up. Once I got it fully open it stood on its own. This allowed me to rest a [[ASIN:B000079XWD OXO Good Grips 3-Piece Funnel and Strainer Set]] (I use the bigger funnel in this set) in the open top and easily fill the pouch.<br /><br />If you have some grocery store pouches now, save the tops! They fit the Little Green Pouch and I have to confess that by the time I had cleaned my pouch, prepared breakfast, and was ready to fill the pouch I had already misplaced the white cap it came with.<br /><br />I was able to fit 8oz in the pouch after lightly tapping it on the counter to get the contents to settle. I had to very carefully close the zip top so nothing would ooze out so you are better off leaving it at 6oz. The meal was bananas, apples, blueberries, and whole wheat cereal. My 15 month old had no problem emptying the pouch and we had no problems with food sticking inside the pouch. I rinsed it with water right away to make \\"real\\" cleaning easier.<br /><br />As of the writing of this review you can find these pouches cheaper if you head over to their website and order them directly.<br /><br />----June 2013 Update----<br />I've downgraded my review from 5 stars to 3. These seemed simple to keep clean at first but now I see how annoying they truly are. I wash them first with a bottle brush, then I wrap cotton around the blunt end of a bamboo skewer (think extra long cotton swab) and use it to get the tiny food particles that stick in the creases at the bottom of the bag, then I wash them with a bottle brush again. Thank god the bottom is clear so I can see what I'm doing but the end result is time consuming and not always worth the effort.<br /><br />I still think they are a great idea and out of all the reusable food bags out there these are still your best bet. I just don't have the time to spend to keep them properly clean. Defeats the purpose of the pouch in my opinion.
B0002Q92V0|5|We bought this set when our son was just starting to reach for toys, hold them in his hands, etc., and we couldn't have picked a better set. All of the toys have something easy to hold on to, especially for tiny hands.    By far, the best in the bunch is that fish though! This has been his go-to toy for months now. I keep it stashed in the diaper bag whenever we go out, and he never seems to grow tired of it. He's ten months old now, and we're still getting use out of all five toys.    As another reviewer said, everything can be washed in the dishwasher. I've also thrown the fish in with a load of laundry before.
B002ZB8298|2|For installation of the movement sensor pad under the mattress, the instructions ask that you place the sensor pad between a sheet of plywood (not included) and the crib mattress.  This complicates installation and portability (for moving to another crib).    The monitor does not have the option of operating without the movement sensor pad.  This impacts the portability and setup time of the monitor if you want to move it to another crib (like when you're traveling with the baby).    The vibration feature does not activate when the baby cries.  It only activates when the baby hasn't moved for 20 seconds, the room temperature has moved outside the set limits, or the remote connection has been lost.  If you want to listen to music or watch a loud movie, you will need to hear the crying on the monitor to know your baby needs you -- it will not vibrate.    If the movement sensor pad does not detect movement for 20 seconds, an audible alarm is activated on both the nursery unit and the parent unit.  This means that if the sensor can't detect the baby's movement, it will wake up your baby.  While this makes sense for making sure your baby is ok, it is much more likely that the sensor pad will have a problem detecting movement than for your baby to actually not be moving.  The sensitivity of the movement sensor pad can be adjusted, but you might have some problems waking up your baby while you find the best setting.    Because of the alarm that is activated due to a lack of movement, you'll need to remember to turn off both the nursery unit and parent unit when you remove the baby from the crib to prevent the alarm from sounding on both units.    OVERALL: While I did find this to be an innovative technology for monitoring the baby, I found that the issues above do not outweigh the benefits.  If portability, ease of setup and noise-activated vibration are important, you may want to consider another option.
B00DZ0MAD2|5|My three month old is super chunky and was getting a rash in his neck rolls.  Even with wiping out his rolls, keeping them dry, and occasionally applying ointment, nothing was making it go away.  The other day I just wiped his neck down with one of these Nose and Face Wipes and his rash was almost gone the next morning!  I don't know what's in these...but they work to keep my baby's neck clean and rash free!
B00CWN3JME|5|Love it..
B006ZVV0P2|5|They protect my seats from my kids kicking them in my 2014 Ford Fusion perfectly.
B002SE6SWU|5|This is perfect for the crib.  The colors are amazing and fabric is very soft.  This is a must have with to complete the set.
B000TCV0MQ|5|I love this walker. It is so different than all the others out there and my baby loves it. She enjoys lengthy playtime by herself in it and I can easily carry it to any room I am in because it is light weight. I have not had any problems with clips as I read in other reviews. This is the second one I have purchased to keep one at our house and one at the grandparent's house since it is such a hit in our family.
B00HY58696|5|This sleeper is adorable. Fits great. Great quality. Got it for Valentine's Day, but she wore it beyond the holiday, too. :)
B00005BYUR|5|Originally I was thinking of buying the Playtex nurser system, but did't want to spend more money on those little plastic inserts. My baby has bad gas, and I knew these bottles would help. They have proven to be the best there is. There are a few parts to each bottle but it is easy to put together in no time. And I'd rather clean a few parts then spend more money on those plastic inserts. It practically stopped his spit-up, he's never had colic, and by using these bottles and giving him gas drops, he's got no gas, and is a happy baby! I also like how these bottles easily connect to my breast pump---they say it's best to pump into the bottle you're going to feed your baby with, I don't know why. I bought the 4 oz bottles for when he was a newborn, and now we use the 8oz bottles too. I'm trying to spread the word about how great these things are. And they aren't expensive!
B00F0NN88S|5|My grandchild loves his stuffed animal and doesnt consider it a threat to put it on,  I am looking forward to many springtime walks without the worry of him running into a dangerous situation. In addition, putting their favorite take along items on their outing.
B004RCIGX0|5|It's great for our needs.  The one-cup size is perfect for storing watermelon, strawberries, bread, etc.  Very pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />My only complaint...is that the threads are really hard to screw together.  Sometimes it takes me forever to get the lid on, because I can't get the threads to line up right.  It's bewildering, I don't know why the lid doesn't just screw on like it should.  It almost always gets cross-threaded.
B00BEIHZ5U|5|Item was as expected. 6 month old grandson loves it!!!<br />Great quality and easy to put together. Would buy again.
B002TUTPCI|3|I thought of this idea 28 years ago about 20 years before it was ever produced commercially and what they ended up with was really an annoying cumbersome dissapointment compared to what i had envisioned.  My daughter actually bought this through my account and she feels that its just best to just start with a jogging stroller since you'll need one eventually hahahahah
B0056Y4PFQ|5|Just wish we could pick the pack of colors we could buy. My son got purple.
B00M2U9ZMK|4|Great accompaniment to Goodbyn small meal box for my preschooler's lunch box. We haven't observed any leaking from the dip container, however, we have only used it for yogurts and hummus.
B007VBXJB8|5|I bought one of each of several types of bottles when I was preparing to go back to work and needed to have my son (at that point, 2.5 months old) start eating off a bottle. I ended up returning the rest of them, because he tried this one and did great. Since I'm breastfeeding and pumping, he will probably never need a larger bottle (he eats ~2-3 oz every meal). He does need to burp afterwards, but he needs to after he nurses as well. We have not noticed any additional spitting up with these bottles. We only use the newborn nipple (and won't be going past that). It comes out pretty quickly, but after the first few minutes of the first bottle feed in the morning he gets used to it.<br /><br />I have seen two interesting changes with him since he's been using these bottles.<br />One: he doesn't always like to change back to nursing. The bottle is &#34;easier&#34;, so we have had a few times where I had to wait out a crying fit because he didn't want to nurse, he wanted the bottle. We don't give in, and he eventually naps and eats or just settles down and eats.<br />Two: when he bottle feeds, he tucks in and eats until he is done. Before, when he was nursing exclusively, he would sometimes suck once then pull off, latch again, suck once, and pull off. He could repeat this for 10 mins before he would settle down and eat (if he ever did). Now that he's been using this bottle, he will almost always tuck in and nurse solidly until he is full. This has actually reduced his spitting up.<br /><br />They are easy to clean but do have a tendency to hold onto a thin layer of the fat from my milk. I simply wash them out with very hot water again before I pump into it or use it.
B000S9A37I|4|We've had 2 of these now.<br /><br />the first one was in a crib with a solid bottom at it was great ! then we decided to get a different colored crib, that one had a springy mesh bottom.. it doesn't do to well on that.
B006ZISQVQ|5|I used to have like 4 of these, they r amazing! I used two in the car so that my todlers can step n on then n clim in the car seat,  n then another for the potty n another for the sink. I boutg7them.like 4 years ago n they still where amazing, however i recently moved n they got lost.  I bouht them for 12 dollara in kmart but cant finaf then any where else noww i know thay r discontnued.
B000XGC7WK|2|I have had these bottles for a few months.  They were fine at first.  I but them in the dishwasher (top rack)  The print has pretty much all come off including the oz. measurement.  And I have just noticed now that they are collapsing sometimes as my son is drinking (8 months old).  But they were good for a while.
B004Y426MI|5|Baby enjoyed it. So did the cats.
B004UJO98Q|1|This base unit failed after 90 days of use and can no longer link with the handsets.  It's in warranty but very frustrating, this seems like such a simple type of technology to produce a quality product with, but for some reason brand after brand has had many issues.
B002WN2BVO|1|Cheap price but I wouldn't buy it again. Part of the time you can't hear what you are listening too on it. It makes a popping noise the whole time it is on and it cuts itself off.
B000FFL58Q|5|My infant likes the colors and all the toys that dangle, the music too. I thought that the toys are supposed to spin, but they dont, but it still is a good product.
B00DR9SZ6C|3|Love the look, but there just isn't enough space for everything with the mini-cooler. It renders half the bag useless if it's in there. If I thought I could fit everything in there, I'd love it.
B00D97W0FO|5|I purchased the small box. It is light, sturdy and the cover is attached. Absolutely perfect for a 3 yr old. He loves it and takes it everywhere.
B00005NBE5|2|I think this monitor has the right idea but unless your child sleeps in the middle of the crib directly on top of the monitor pad you will get false alarms. My twin boys are 7 months old and the only reason they ever wake up in the middle of the night is because the alarm on the monitor is going off. I had to set the sensitivity on the monitor all the way up and just like before we still get woken up in the middle of the night because one of my sons had moved to the foot of the crib.
B00HAZS6BS|3|This rocker is solidly built; it was very easy to assemble it. The smell of the cushions was terrible. It took three weeks of airing this rocker out in our cellar to get rid of the smell. Without the smell, I would given this product a five star rating.
B001D7JPTQ|3|I thought the material would be a little thinker so it doesn't do much good for cold winter nights.  However, its big and fits my 2 year old well.
B0002ZOI92|3|I have a 2 month old that is finally getting to like the swing more and more.  It's pretty nice.  Not too bulky and not too heavy.   <br />The flaws: <br />-I wish the handle bar would open so I can easily carry my baby in and out of it.  It's really diffult to get her in and out of the swing <br />-The swing is too fast at the lowest speed <br />-I wish we had the option of just using the lights without the music, if it does have that feature, mine doesn't work
B000F1MUKM|3|This gate is high quality. However, it was very hard to install properly. Once it is installed, you won't want to move it as it is designed to stay up all the time. I don't recommend this for a space that you want to be able to open up at any point. For us, it's between the kitchen and living areas to keep the dogs out. But when we have guests over, we'll want to move it and that is going to be a huge pain.
B000XA8N2O|5|We have had this booster seat now for almost a year and we love it.  It's comfortable for my daughter and she can climb up by herself without the seat moving an inch.  The seat has traveled with us to several family members and I have never had any issue with the varnish coming of a chair.  It is also used several times a day and is cleaned just as many times.  I have yet to see a tear in it.  I would absolutely recommend this seat unless, of course, you have padded chairs, then this seat is not for you.
B004GXA6MO|5|I bought this car seat for my Grandson<br /> It is very easy to use and works great.<br />Cost was good.  It was sent very fast.
B006NK5K74|1|A pice of junk and a rip off.  The item does not work and is made of very cheap looking plastic.  It looks toxic.
B0014J0W8G|5|keeps the cabinet securely shut.
B00GRS9YQK|3|I have a six-year-old and an eighteen-month-old, and surprisingly, they both played with the little bath toys that came with this Sassy Splashin' Fun Bath Tub.  The turtle “cup” has holes in it for a shower-like effect and fun play, but it will retain water long enough to dump the majority on the baby to rinse off.  Those are probably probably the best features of this set.  The tub is light enough that the little one (1 and 1/2 years) picked it up, and the plug hole is easy enough to remove.  She did this as well, which was an immediate cause for concern.  And unfortunately, she took it completely off the tub.  It’s easy to snap back on, but I don’t see it staying in place for very long.  While we no longer need the newborn mesh at this point, I did place my 21-pound baby on it and it stayed. It was easy enough to get on but took a bit of effort to remove.<br /><br />As for the “storage” bin, I don’t know why I bother to replace it when it repeatedly falls off.  Don't carry the tub by this end because the bin is very easily removed.  The storage areas themselves are slightly curved but should hold all normal-shaped bottles, and sample/travel sizes well--but not round ones.  Plus, they’re not very deep, so I can see bottles easily falling out, and they really don’t provided much room to store the toys, a feature prominently mentioned on the box.  That said, the tub itself is great and works just as well as the other baby tubs I have used over the years.  It's useful for giving our baby a bath and for storing a few of our various tub toys.
B004GCJN5G|3|Not what I expected but its ok my son still likes the music on it. I was looking for more of a white noise machine..
B0096XGTNE|5|My son, who is now One month old LOVES this seat... well, he's never complained :) *I* love it!!  He sleeps in this every single night right by my bed. It's a great option for moms who want their baby close enough to touch, yet not in their beds!<br /><br />This is so portable we take it in and out of my room to the livingroom in the day for the occasional nap {he also naps in the day a lot in his crib to get used to sleeping flat on his back as well.} Very light weight, I can carry it with one hand {which I have to do quite often!}<br /><br />When he needs a little movement it's super easy to rock back and forth with a gentle touch. This doesn't rock on it's own.<br /><br />There has been a Recall-to-inspect put out for this because some people found mold under the padding, but that is a user problem not the manufacturers... I can't see how the padding could get so wet it could grow mold unless you spill something in it, leave a bottle in it? Or a heavily leaky diaper that wasn't cleaned up?  I think most people who buy will never have a mold issue.<br /><br />I LOVE the snugamonkey line, it's all so cute. The Monkey fabric is soooo soft.  But I'm sure all the Rock N Plays are just as wonderful, just choose the style you like best!!
B006SFUEF2|5|We purchased this sound machine in 2012, when our son was born. I think it is simply the best. My son likes the sound of the ocean now, but for the longest time he listened to the music. The volume is great, you can adjust it to where it is super quiet or really loud. The pictures that come with it are also great. There are 3 of them and they are bright and clear (I had another sound machine, which was cheaper and battery operated and the difference was amazing!). At one point I dropped the machine on the floor and even though the light and sound came on, the picture quit moving. I thought I had broken it, but after taking the disk out and putting it in again, it started moving again. Needless to say, I was thrilled! The only thing I don't like about it is the blue light that comes on when you plug the machine in. It seems to be very bright at night and since our son slept in our room for 2.5 yrs, I could not fall asleep with it unless I unplugged it or put a cloth over it. It does not bother my son or my husband though, so it must be just me :) I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a sound machine/projector! We are expecting a second baby and I am considering purchasing another one :)
B00004YMZE|5|We have this gate at the top of our stairs. It is a really good one. My 5 year old cannot even open it but it is no problem for my husband and I. IT is strong and sturdy and looks nice. Wood is always more appealing than plastic.
B00BHRBNZQ|5|perfect fit perfect for toddler girl and boy,easy to clean and store.<br />i would recommend this product for children 18 months to 4 years.
B001RAAKZM|5|We had a need for smaller car seats as I have three &#34;car-seated&#34; kids and a Chevy Cruze.  My one son is in a booster and then I have a 2 year old and a 1 year old.  We where able to fit two of these and a booster seat safely and comfortably in the back of the Cruze.  My child are safe in these seats and they are very compact.  They are easy to install also.
B00J1901JQ|5|We originally bought the 2013 Clek Foonf for my wife's car, and liked it so much, we ordered another for my car. This is a heavy carseat, and you can definitely see and feel the quality!
B0045I6IA4|1|came with broken box and wrong color.
B00WTJC9NQ|5|My son got this blanket. We love it. People are always asking where we got it.
B0000A1O7P|3|I haven't used this as much yet as I planned.  It is heavier and more adjustment  than the simpler one I had 30 years ago.  But it looks safe.
B000HIP38Y|2|Bulky, hard to read. Give signal even when out of water (so I assume accumulate water inside already after just several weeks of use). Won't buy again.
B003W5WP6W|4|My baby liked this very much but I wish that the crown was as soft as the doll.
B003BQWBUW|5|served their purpose. helped me to pump with my madela pump in style pump.
B00G29KLMK|4|Arrived on time with all the pieces. Disappointed that the bottle measurements are not marked in a different color than the bottles. It's hard to read the raised measurements just because they are as clear as the bottles.
B0031KMAJK|5|Good crib and easy to assemble. Thank you!
B0048SOBGO|5|Great lables that stick well! I use these on my baby's bottles for daycare. I was them in the dishwasher every night and they stay on extremely well.
B009F1OC54|5|really comes in handy and so easy to install to handlebar. I just wished it came with the stroller instead of paying $20 something for it..
B004PEITQO|5|This is honestly one of the cutest stuffed animals I've ever seen...and, having 2 children, I've seen quite a few. I got this for my 2 year old; we named her \\"Olivia\\", and now she's one of my daughter's favorite toys. Aside from being completely adorable, it's very soft, a good size, and it's durable. I've washed \\"Olivia\\" several times, and she's held up well.
B0011URFRE|5|My lil girls absolutely love these car seats.   I had gotten one for my 3yr old from walmart, and the next week, the price jumped 20%.  Found this one on amazon for cheaper than I bought the pink daisy one at walmart, and it's the same exact car seat with a different cover and pattern.  The cupholders are fabulous as I used to always have to be reaching in the back to grab drinks from the kids while I was driving so they didn't end up thrown on the floor and spilled.  They are very well padded and extremely comfortable for the kids.      I have also noticed the the seat is deep enough that when they fall asleep, their head doesn't droop over or hang to the side like it did in our old car seat.  Would definitely recommend spending the extra money to get this car seat, as it's ability to convert allows your child to grow into it.
B005537IFW|5|very soft pink doll. no long ribbons or hair so safe for little ones and very cute  love this doll.
B001HX4DNE|5|Scared baby at first but at 5 months started to enjoy it
B00BO9HRXY|5|my son has reflux so unfortunately this gets icky sometimes.  cleans up well in the wash/dryer though.  love that it is soft and helps to comfort him while changing his pampers.
B00JRYEV1E|5|After some terrible advice from a lactation consultant (she told me that I needed to get bigger flanges), I bought these. So very glad I did. They fit better, I no longer have misshapen nipples after pumping (too much aerola was pulled in on the bigger flanges), and the soft plastic is much more comfortable to pump with. The only two issues I have with them is that it seems that milk gets stuck in the tube (the end piece has only three holes at the end) and that you can't sterilize these in the microwave.  They are for smaller nipples!
B00G5DVCKS|5|We use this daily to watch our house when we travel.  It worked perfectly and shipped on time.  Thanks!
B005PBPMKW|5|GOOD
B000XP7EIS|5|good product
B003HS5JMQ|5|This backpack is so cute I can hardly stand it. I use it mainly to cart around my 2 year-old son's toys and books in my car in case I need to keep him entertained somewhere but there is not a whole lot of room in the backpack.
B004QZBEFK|5|These little containers are perfect! The lids come apart for easy cleaning. Just throw in the diaper bag and go.
B00EI1ML6S|5|I ordered 3 of these bath rings for my triplets. My boys are loving taking a bath in these chairs. I feel that they are safe and I can bathe them all at the same time.  Although one of the rings came with defective suction cups, after I contacted the seller he wrote back and immediately shipped a new one.
B003KMW4EA|5|Dr browns works well to reduce the amount of air the baby gets when bottle feeding. You can upgrade the nipples as the baby grows
B00005QI1G|5|This chair has become a life saver for me.  My daughter has sat in it since she was one week old.  As she gets older, she loves it more and more.  The lights and music caught her attention right away, but now that she is two months, she loves batting at the toys.  Fisher price chose a great set of colors.  Another great feature is the removable toy bar.  My daughter sits in this as she is watching her Baby Mozart videos or as she watches us.  This gives me a little &quot;hands-free&quot; time.  I loved this priduct so much, I bought the Oceans Aquarium bouncer for my mothers house and my daughter loves it just as much.  This is a must have toy.
B00GJIXMZW|4|Heavier than I thought it would have been but well made - very well made.
B009147RJS|4|~BACKGROUND~<br />I purchased this product to start using with my 2 month old son to aid in the development of his neck and back strength.<br /><br />~PROS~<br />- Soft, comfortable feel to the Bumbo.<br />- Bumbo feels stable and solid.<br /><br />~CONS~<br />- The leg holes are snug even for my 3 month old 15 pound baby with average thickness legs.  It's especially challenging to get my son out because one or both of his legs gets stuck and ends up pulling the whole Bumbo up with him.<br />- Not for babies with chunky legs and larger babies.<br />- The safety belt is difficult to use.<br /><br />~TIPS~<br />- Do not leave your baby unattended while in the Bumbo due to the potential for tipping over.<br />- Best used for babies who can sit up on their own.<br />- Add the [[ASIN:B000NAOH1A Bumbo Seat Play Tray, Ivory]] to provide a playing surface.<br />- Add a suction style toy such as [[ASIN:B006YDFZSO Infantino Stick and Play Highchair Toy]] to stick to the play tray.<br /><br />~CONCLUSION~<br />Even with the seat and leg areas being a little on the snug side and the challenge of getting my son out, I recommend this product.  I use the Bumbo daily with the before mentioned Play Tray and Stick and Play Toy and my son sits in it for up to 45 minutes playing and interacting.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I would expect another month of use at most with the Bumbo once my son is 4 months old and is too big for it.
B0012E4FV8|4|the item arrived very quickly and without having to pay for extra fast shipping.  we have yet to use it yet, but it looks like just the thing we'll need to keep our 18 month old happy on the airplane in his own seat for the first time!  and the best part is that this is the ONLY FAA approved airplane seat device that is approved for take off and landing, and it is SO tiny and light weight, unlike carrying your own big car seat with you!
B001LNNQUQ|5|I have these in the dragonflies. i too thought they were stickers but had no trouble at all applying them. my daughter even did a few and she's 11 years old. I think they look alot better than the sticker decals.These actually look like you had them painted on your walls. Good product and yes i recomend them.
B00FNJ7FR4|5|One of the top three purchases we've made for our baby. It gives him some independence and lets him explore, and he loves cruising around the kitchen and hallway on his own ! It was a great way for him to start walking, and also has given his mama some much-needed use of both of her hands. ;)
B007S1T42O|2|I received a gift card to a high-end baby store.  This was one of the least expensive items in the store (at $40).  I thought it was adorable, albeit, impractical.  However, I had the gift card so I bought it.  My daughter is 2 months old and we've been using it 1-2 times a week since she came home from the hospital.  We've put it through the wash twice.<br /><br />I'll start with the pros.  This bath is adorable and your baby will be even more adorable in it when you take pictures.  It is super soft.  I've got 2 other girls who I bathed the old-fashioned way when they were newborns (holding over the kitchen sink, trying not to let them literally slip out of my hands).  This bath allows me to set the baby in the petals and wash her without feeling like I'm going to drop her.  For the first time (in baby bathing history at our house), the baby doesn't scream through bath time.  It is a very relaxing experience compared to my other children.  It is a very snug fit in the sink, but I like it because it allows the baby to sit up more.  Some reviewers didn't care for the fit in the sink, but I don't mind.<br /><br />Now, for the cons...the bath is expensive and poorly made, in my opinion.  We've only used the bath a maximum of 16 times (I really don't think we've even used it that much)and the seam that connects the center to the petals has already split quite significantly.  Also, it is difficult to wring out (even if you follow the directions of pressing all the petals to the center) and therefore, quite heavy (which probably contributed to the split seam).<br /><br />While I love bath time with this, I wish it was a higher quality product.  Maybe then it would be worth the $40+ price tag.  As it is, I can't recommend something this expensive that has not kept it's stitching.
B00J2P9WS0|5|A safe way to keep my granddaughter from running off when we go to the mall.
B004G8QSYO|5|Thank you
B0014HKRWO|5|This is a super flat mattress pad for the crib.  The top layer of cotton is soft and so is the vinyl backing for waterproofing the pad.  I washed as instructed and the top cotton side is very soft.  It is easy to change in the middle of the night and have purchased 2 more for the crib.<br />I also bought the flat pad as shower gifts and my friends love it too.
B00GXGOEC0|2|It did the job for my baby girl but it wasn't my favorite. The liner is not detachable but only folds out to wash. Not very user friendly for me. It took a lot longer to dry and bundled up in a ball so it didn't wash as well as my other diapers. I would not buy this again. She also grew out of it very quickly
B00648KTCG|4|I bought this in orange to brighten up the room. The baby loves it and I can have piece of mind he's safe while I run around the house. It's large enough to contain him, his floor gym and some toys. 2 kids could easily fit in here.
B00CA78DH8|4|I just received mine today and haven't yet used it but I thought it would be good to mention to others that this comes with a hood. It doesn't say that anywhere and it isn't shown in the pictures so I did not know that. It also comes with a carry bag that you can clip to the front and store all sorts of goodies, extra bonus. I wish I would have known it came with the hood though because I ordered the accessory pack. I wanted both the hood and the infant insert. In hind site I would have just ordered the infant insert and saved myself the 10 dollars.
B00SGP6316|1|I really liked that this baby soap is an all natural product.  I am pregnant and purchased this baby wash to use on my soon to be born daughter as well as my 20 month old son.  I wondered if the citrus scent would be a good choice for babies and in my opinion it is too strong for a new born.  I have used it on my son for about a month and really like it except that it stings his eyes.  He would start to fuss, cry, and say &#34; owie&#34; when I washed his hair and face with it.  At first I thought he was just being difficult but then I washed my face with it and it really stung my eyes!  At least he could tell me that it was hurting him, but a newborn would not be able to.  I definitely will not use this product on my new born and won't purchase it again.  CK
B0000DEW8N|5|I bought this booster seat for my 8 month old son.  I always hated putting him in the highchairs at restaurants because they always seem dirty and covered in residue/food/spit and whatever else the bus boy's dirty rag didn't wipe off.  I purchased this seat because it seemed portable and easy to set up.  This product was not a disappointment. When sitting at a booth - I merely slide the seat in besides me and unfold easily.  With his own little tray there is no need for him to touch the table - he has his own little area to eat on!!  On chairs you strap the seat in tightly both bottom and back and it is like a make shift high chair - again with its own tray.  My son feels like a big boy at the table and the wait staff always raves about my \\"little man\\" at the table!  Portable, secure and easy to assemble - GREAT!!!
B001BX5154|3|I really do like the reward chart. It sticks to the fridge and has velcro stars to put up each time they sit on the potty, go potty, etc.  I think it is cute and it actually worked for my son! Trust me we had a hard time and this was great. I tried making my own reward charts, I tried a sticker thing and bribed him with Hershey kisses, etc.. That said, the price is way too high. The book and certificate aren't very useful - I really only wanted the chart and stars. The other thing I will mention is that there are exactly enough stars to fill all of the spots, no extras. We didn't lose any but I am sure people do (like under the fridge!).
B009SP943M|5|Fit my Bumbo perfectly. I had a hand-me down Bumbo that was in good shape but the color had faded. This cover updated the look and it's easily removable for washes. I love it!
B000E16658|3|I purchased this bag so that we could check our MacLaren Quest stroller. While it's true that the bag is padded it is only padded in the upper smaller portion where it unzips. The rest of the bag is un-padded and that's where it left me a little nervous since it offers very little protection for the stroller itself. To put me at ease, I wrapped the more fragile areas with blankets and padded with some diapers. I also asked the airline to stick a \\"Fragile\\" sticker on there to lessen the chances of it getting dog piled below a bunch of heavy bags. We successfully made it through one round trip but I'll definitely continue to pad it and ask for the sticker.
B006VXLBQM|5|Bought this Elmo shopping cart  cover for my 1 & 1/2 year old daughter because she loves Elmo.  The color is great, it ties to the cart & a seperate belt tie for her.  It was a great price. Recommend it to anyone :-)
B00K0SCI3E|5|Very accurate and easy to operate. Very satisfied with my product.
B001GQ2P96|4|Purchased this for our newborn to sleep in our room. He is now 8 wks old and is still sleeping in it. It is sturdy and he seems to be comfortable in it. I love the color as it matches the colors I went with in his nursery. The one drawback is that the light and sounds stopped working after about 4 weeks. This is not a big deal since we have a nightlight close to it and sleep with a sound machine anyway. I hope it will remain solid when I start using it as a play pen
B00EEYZCTC|5|This is my second bedrail, and only good things to say! It arrived on time and I couldn't have beat the price
B00CA353FC|5|This might feel like a bit much to spend on what is essentially a small piece of wood on a string- but it is nice and smooth and functional and cute...and not made in China! Which is rare nowadays. Baby is not chewing on dangerous plastic, silicone, painted wood, etc. Just pure unfinished alder wood. This is the safest chewing option for teething babies! The quality is good. It's a bit larger/thicker than I thought it'd be. Baby seems to like playing with the string as much as chewing right now. Nice to have something to keep hands busy while bfing.
B005JN6304|5|Very happy with the look and quality of this gate.
B000O3GCFU|2|I use this to send my daughter's lunch to school.  I heat the food as hot as I can in the morning, but she complains that the food is cold by lunchtime.  Her class goes to lunch at 10:55 AM, which I think is a pretty early lunch.  I am looking for something else that will actually keep her food warm.
B00AA6LQKM|5|These are perfect for my 6 month old! We first made formula pops but have since moved on to fruit. And vegetable pops.  Good size for his little hands and good size for amount of food!
B001DVRTEA|5|These are so practical.  I use them on high chairs, strollers, and car seats. No more picking up the toys off the floor and having to wipe them off. And my son even likes to try out his new teeth on the strap.
B001CFFX90|1|The item does not grip to the wall and you can not put any weight on it, when you do it falls off. Not what I wanted.
B00CJD5Y4I|5|The car seat protector is perfect my husband and I bought a new charger for our 50th birthdays at the same time had our first grand baby  So this works great to protect the seat from car seat. Would highly recommend
B00439UNR4|5|Thirsties are our favorite diaper covers. They rarely leak, seem comfortable and are high quality.
B004OSF4J6|1|the actual holder part is fine but the snap unsnaps incredibly easy so i find the pouch in the driveway, car, store floor, etc.  it just falls off whatever you've hooked it to much too easily unfortunately.  i've purchased another one from a different company that hasn't fallen off once.
B002GWVZDG|5|Love it just what I wanted and expected by an Amazon vendor.
B0098RIARQ|5|Wanted a style that was more bangle than beads and so I was very excited to find these. Was a tad more than I wanted to spend, but both of my twins really like them. Like really, really like them. It's an easy way to always have a chew toy on you. I have some of the necklaces that are popular, but I'm not into them as much as I am these and I can't be yanked/choked with these. :-)
B00LCJ4Q9O|5|As described.
B004QZBED2|5|Great to hold all sorts of snacks! Love the style and colors! Easy for my small daughters hands to reach in for her snacks. You can tip this cup upside down and it doesn't lose any snacks! And yet keeps the dog from taking away any items, unless my daughter provides them to her!
B0092NNQ98|3|The bumbo was perfect for our little one when he was about 3-5 months old. It was about the time he could hold his neck up and that offered some much needed relief for the back of his head (it was so flat due to laying on it so often). This enabled him to sit up and watch me cook, clean, or read to him. The tray was useless because it's just not big enough to keep all the food on it. I'd get this item used or borrow it from a friend since it really can only be used for a few months. A portable high chair will work fine and lasts longer too.<br /><br />If you are looking for more products to add to your baby registry, check out the website, AllMomsArePerfect for what you really do need and what you can live without. It's got tons of good advice for new moms too.
B002RL808Y|5|This is our second Precious Planet high chair.  It's a great fit, easy to assemble and easy to clean.  Very comfortable and safe.  The removable tray cover is a great benefit.
B00WG405FI|1|DO NOT BUY!<br />Worst diapers EVER. Even alvababy diapers are better than this junk. Spend a few extra get a better brand.
B001IYQ7QS|5|This is a great mat and does the trick for a good price. Easy to clean, provides good coverage under the high chair and folds up easily. Didn't smell too plastic-y either when I first received it. A great value!
B008BKU61O|5|I bought these as a gift and the mother really likes them.
B00ERBJ61W|5|Great no problems..fit great
B000IDSLOG|5|I can't stress enough how amazing this toy is. I must admit I was skeptical when I bought it, but right out of hte box my daughter grabbed it and did not put it down all night! We've had it for about  a month and it continues to be her favorite toy, by far. We bring it everywhere. It's the only thing she does not lose interest in after a few minutes. It has become her item of comfort at this point. I don't know what it is about it - how easy it is to hold, how it feels so good on her gums, the cute squeak? I may never really know what she loves, but just that she loves it!
B002UD6F3Q|4|My son loves to play with these, and they are adorable. My biggest complaint is that they flip upside down in the water too often because they are bottom heavy.
B00H3X80TU|3|I use this tub for my 6 month old. I had previously been using one of those large bath sponges but as my baby started rolling over it was difficult to keep him from rolling into the water. This bather helped with that. This bather requires you to fill the tub with more water so that it keeps the baby warm during bath time.<br />I did not have it when my baby was younger, but probably wouldn't have used it. It would be better if it held in some water (when using at sink) to help keep the baby warm.
B009Q9YNPO|5|This was very easy to put up on the wall.  Despite instructions I was able to do this alone and it looks amazing in the nursery!
B000XDXD08|5|This bib catches all the spills and washes up quickly.  My niece loves using it for her daughter.
B009XFLHZA|4|She says it looks like Mike from Monsters, Inc and loves the towel.  After two weeks of use, I havent seen any flaws or problems.
B006Z6D61I|3|It holds toothbrush and toothpaste pretty good and design is cute, but it gets moldy inside quite often.<br />you need to clean inside often otherwise, your toothbrush will get moldy on the bottom side.
B009IW3Y3Q|2|I bought this bag because of the good experiences I have had with other Columbia back packs...fast forward six months and the seams are coming apart at the straps and the main compartment.  I only used it for air travel and occasional hikes so the bag did not even withstand the wear and tear of every day use.  When I called Columbia to see about making a warranty claim they informed their diaper bags are made  by a company called California Innovations and that I would have to contact them.  California Innovations did respond to the email I sent them and has offered to send me another bag, although I don't really want it.  Bottom line... this bag is poorly constructed and I will not make the mistake of buying another \\"Columbia\\" diaper again.
B002RXPQHK|5|Good quality sheets that fit our mattress well. It is also organic. We liked it so much that we bought a second one.
B00ERDG7EE|5|Love it. Bought for 19 month old grand-daughter. She is tiny. (19 lbs). This was perfect. She loves to put her things in and pack them around.
B00LIRJ2KI|5|It was built tough and steady. Fits very well for my 3 yr daughter.
B000GX0B3M|4|Before buying this wheely I spent a LOT of time reading through all the reviews as to whether to get the small or large wheely for my 1.5 year old boy/girl twins.  And I made the WRONG decision - so I am hoping I can help others.<br /><br />I have big kids (95% on height) so I figured I should buy the big one so they can grow into it.  When I first bought it for them they pushed it around with their hands, but quickly got bored because their legs were too short to ride on it.  Now that they are 2.4 years old and their legs are long enough, they are more excited to ride a tricycle or a scooter, and this is too 'sedate' for them.<br /><br />So this is what I would recommend.  Measure the inseam of your kid's legs.  If they are 14\\" or longer, then buy the large size.  But if their legs are shorter and you want them to ride on it now, then buy the small size.<br /><br />Now, something to think about - I keep the wheelys outside - so my kids have a lot of options of things to ride on.  So they hardly ever choose the wheelys.  If this was an 'inside toy' with no other exciting options to ride on, then they would probably use it more.<br /><br />So, to summarize:<br /> - legs (inseam) shorter than 13\\" - buy the small.<br /> - legs (inseam) longer than 14\\" - buy the large<br /> - if your kids are already on tricycles, scooters or anything that goes a bit faster, they will be bored with this outside - and I would plan on it being an 'inside toy' where it will be used more.<br /> - if you are going to use it inside, then I would buy the smaller one because it will take up less space and will be more maneuverable.<br /> - Basically I should have bought the small so they could have used it when they were younger and not yet ready for faster toys.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful to you!
B002OOWAC6|5|Arrived promptly and the owner of this product is in love! Very awesome!
B000GGD3O8|5|I love this gate! I have two. One is to corral the doggies in while we are away and the other is for my daughter's play area.  The gate is very strong and easy to use, while holding a squirmy baby in the other hand.  It's not loud and the magnetic closure has minimal noise, and doesn't wake up my baby when she's sleeping at all.  I highly recommend this gate!  Super easy to install -- my husband did it in less than 10 minutes.  The second gate that we bought from Amazon actually had a defective piece, so I called the company and they sent us a new one right away.
B000TZVW9E|5|I use them with thirstys duo snap covers and they contain everything except for a huge occasional poop, and if I don't change her often enough and the diaper gets soaked, it can leak onto her clothes a little. I love them, had them 2 months and a few do have what seem to be permanent poop stains, but that can be because I'm not using the right detergent
B004L2JX06|5|So comfortable!!
B00CEH60UQ|2|When I first opened the Kawaii Little Green Bamboo diapers they felt nice, very soft, and good quality. It was after a few months of use (in a large rotation) that I finally got rid of them. Sadly after just a few washes they were horribly pilly. But they still worked so no big deal. But after a dozen or so washes the Velcro stopped sticking: first to the laundry tabs, then to the Velcro strip across the waist.<br />I gave 2 stars because I did keep the insert from my green baby bamboo's and still use them a year later. However, I could have bought bamboo inserts for a fraction of the cost of these diapers.
B004ECJWK4|5|Love these! Can't give enough stars, highly recommend!
B000BV4T9Q|4|We have it already 3 weeks, it works very well, we can hear every little noise. The 2 way function also works well. We're very satisfied with it and sleep much better since we got it.   There are only two minor shortcomings: first, that the baby's unit isn't rechargable, so if you want to move it to where the baby sleeps during the day, for example, you have to plug it to a socket. And second, that once the parent's unit is recharged, it lasts only for one night, maximum two.
B00GSNFDQ4|5|Excelent
B0045I6IA4|5|Great product! Easy clean up, babies love the shape and texture, long lasting. Bought like 15 of these.
B008ESOIJE|5|Love the product as its help keep mom from back tracking her toddlers last steps. On the many adventures of who saw the sippy cup last.
B000U3U1WY|4|This product was exactly what i wanted... My son was having trouble getting enough grip on his play mat to be able to roll over which is why I bought this rug.. It goes with the theme of his nursery perfectly. This product came sooner than the estimated delivery date which was awesome.. I love amazon's service it is great, and I will use the sight again and again
B005XHHLD4|5|my child loves it
B0050386O4|5|Love this seat. Using with our second baby now. We only have britax car seats and love their dependability. We use it with the b ready stroller system and love it.
B005DOS2EE|5|A great product!!! I love it
B0000DZCTU|5|This is exactly what I wanted for my daughter's room!! I love it!!! This is so cute! I want to buy more!
B002M77N22|3|I bought this item when Fisher price sent out its updated catalog of new items for this year.  It was super new and there were no reviews yet.  I like the material on this sleeper.  Unfortunately the picture is deceiving. It is super deep for a baby to sleep in. I currently have two towels and a baby blanket in the bottom so my son doesn't sink.  Therefor, I can't use the safety straps.  This would be great as a portable sleeper for a 6month plus baby who would fit in it comfortably. It really needs an option to keep it still rather than being on rockers at all times.  I wish there was a lock to keep it from opening again once you close it up.
B003UGZAZ6|3|Works great, baby loved it, but the fabric make me and baby really hot, really quickly and it hurt my shoulder a lot. I didn't use it but 3/4 times.
B004AHKUHM|2|I bought this because it supposedly was the longest range one I could find.  It DOES NOT work for the 2000 feet as the description claims.  It does work well within about half that range.
B001QXCF0I|5|This was bought as a Christmas gift last year and my niece loves it. She eats in it all the time.
B001BX1C5W|5|very good
B0038JDD2C|5|Started using these at two months old. The pink ones are a little lighter than the picture which I liked. Baby leans her cheek on these because they are so soft. I do have to wash them often because they get dirty fairly easily, but they have held up extremely well with multiple washes!
B0006DR1MQ|1|it is a very small bag, and have not used it much since I bought it.....i suggest dont buy..and save your money
B002VBXY68|5|I honestly wish I had gotten a portable swing to begin with. I received this as a gift for traveling and we use it everyday. It's so easy to close up and put away. It's not bulky and my little girl LOVES it!
B004IPBH50|5|I bought this mattress two years ago and I've been very pleased with the purchase. I just bought another one for a family member. I have not had any issues with odor, and its light weight has been a definite plus. There do not appear to be any lumps or bumps after two years of use -- or any signs of wear and tear for that matter. I don't think the mattress cover is worth the money, so feel free to save yourself sixty bucks.
B007ZPFO6S|5|I'll start this by saying that manual breast pumps can be quite annoying, and hard/tiring to use.  That said they are significantly cheaper and can be much simpler to store/travel with for occasional use.  The Avent pump is great because it hooks up to all things Avent, bottles, storage canisters, etc.  Everything designed to work.<br /><br />We have a single electric pump as well and it feels that the device is very close to the same, however of course this one has a handle and a mechanism to create a vacuum.  The handle is comfortable, but you probably still will get tired.  One thing to note after using other cheaper products, is that there are no leaks, the vacuum works quite well, well designed and will work great, but try to get an electric one if you will be using it a lot.
B002A9JCWQ|5|I recently purchased this item and I wasn't sure if it would fit my Dr. Brown's wide neck bottles but it does!!! It's a must have especially if you are planning on feeding your child on the go. It can be placed in your diaper bag or attached to the stroller. It does a good job in keeping the milk cold up to five hours. I am very impressed with this item!
B001F0WSWM|5|I have tried different brands and shapes of pacifiers, and so far the Avent are my favorite. My daughter has really big cheeks and the NUK pacifiers would leave marks on her face. These are great because they stick out farther from the face and do not have the suction affect. They also are a lot easier for her to suck on and keep in her mouth. I would definitely recommend these over the NUK brand.
B002SRINP2|5|These sippy cups are wonderful! My son hasn't been able to figure out how to use the sippies that require you to bite down on the spout while sucking. These cups deliver the beverage with sucking only. They're study too, which is important since all kids chew on their sippy cups. They are not leak proof though--so we continue to use his Born Free sippies for travel.
B000U5FOT2|5|I have 4 and sometimes i attach them all together to make a giant play yard.
B007WF2PGS|4|Sometimes it stops
B005IH6FXQ|5|I've tried a lot of diapers for my baby and this one is our families favorite! It really is an ALL IN ONE unlike some of the other types that claim to be all in ones but you have to snap a soaker pad in. This is actually one piece. This is the only velcro That has held up for us even after 10 months of use. I love sending these with my daughter when shes at a sitters house because they are so simple, nobody gets confused about prefold and inserts and yadayada these are just like a disposable only they get washed and reused instead of being thrown away!<br />They do take a while to dry, our dryer is old so we dry them on high heat twice then air dry the rest of the way.<br />If you are looking for a true all in one cloth diaper that will last BUY THIS!
B001FB5BG6|1|The harness system is too small for my 22 month old son. He weighs 30 pounds and it pinches him and squeezes into his neck. I can't even figure this darn thing out anymore!All I know is it is already as loose as it can go. SO much for being able to grow into it.
B0097F3YES|5|After a couple months of use we had a small problem with one of the buds. I emailed the company and they responded within hours and sent out a replacement the same day! They were extremely understanding and respected the urgency of the matter since we are only a few weeks from our due date and felt this was the most crucial time in our baby's development to use the product. It literally came within 2 days. What I thought was going to be a drawn out issue was solved with a few quick emails. Very impressed with their customer service. We love the product and our baby gets very active every time we play music or our voices.
B003E6OBMA|5|the light  material is nice. very roomie for his lil feet
B001ALLVL0|5|Great Product for your kids and yourself. PingPong rated one of the best indoor games and you and your family can have great fun with this great game this christmas. You Sure want to miss it?
B002UXQRKM|4|We were a bit late to the learning-to-brush scene, and got our daughter these brushes around age 11 months. At that point, our daughter had about 8 teeth, but no molars. She loved the brushes, and chewed on them constantly. She would toddle around the house, waving them above her head and squealing. I think that they would also be a big hit with 6-9 month olds. My review (4 stars) is for that age set, because I think those are the babies they are designed for.     For a 11-12 month old, I'd give them more like 3 stars. They aren't particularly durable for an older child. They started showing serious signs of wear in about a week. The teether one held up better, because the head of that one is a solid piece of hard teething rubber. The more brush-like one is coated with a softer rubber, which didn't hold up to my daughter's tough love--it started peeling off very quickly. The handles of both are coated with the same soft rubber, and also showed teeth marks and peeling after a week or two.    So in sum, these brushes get   *4 stars for younger babies (6-9 mo). I took off one star because I think that they are probably not 100% durable for younger kids either.  *3 stars for older babies (10 + mo) because my daughter managed to chew through the rubber in a surprisingly short time.
B00313JBIK|5|We bought this car seat for our babysitter to use. I chose it because it was one of the top rated seats from Consumer Reports. It is very sturdy and easy to use. My husband and I have Britax seats in our cars, but I didn't want to spend another $200+ for the babysitter to only use a few days a week. The padding on this seat is not very soft. I would definitely not use it for a long trip, but for short trips around town, it's perfect. The most important thing is that it is safe, and this seat is definitely safe.
B0052QYLUM|5|This camera is great for the price!  We have one monitor in my son’s room and one in my daughter’s.  We are able to flip back and forth between the two and see what’s going on if the kids are not sleeping.  The picture is very clear when the kid’s lights are on or off.  Sound is very good and clear!<br /><br />I also like the option to have no sound / no picture if nothing is going on in the room.<br /><br />Battery life is very manageable for our needs.  We’ve never ran out of battery during a normal usage (nap/before we go to bed).<br /><br />Can’t beat the price of this monitor!
B000056W6I|5|EXCELLENT ARTICLE. EXPECTATIONS FULFILLED THAT DESCRIBED IN THE SITE. VERY GOOD SUPPLIER. I RECOMMEND IT. VERY GOOD CARE.
B000X4NYS8|4|This is a beautifully made rattle that my 5 month old has had since birth but just recently begun to take a real interest in. It really holds her attention for quite some time ( in baby terms that's a whopping 5 minutes)! There's just one little problem - the green wooden 'leaves' are quite heavy and when baby gets to transferring this from hand to mouth, as babies inevitably do, the leaves tend to wack her in the face & eyes.
B00PO8W52E|5|Have yet to use it on my baby, but I tried it on myself and it does as advertised. The file is pretty as it fades from the blue to white and it has a good thickness to it. Thicker than your traditional emery board nail file, but not too thick to file and work. Seems very sturdy, but if dropped it will break as any crystal file will that's tempered. The front of it has a grit on it that makes it slightly rough, but not uncomfortable. Still very gentle when filing. I think when using on my newborn even with the slight grit, it won't be as uncomfortable as the emery board. I was worried prior to purchasing that it would file way too easy quickly leaving my babies nails too short, but after using on myself, you do have to put in effort but nothing too bad. Leaves my nails more smooth than nail clippers and a regular emery board. Love that it doesn't have that awful smell like emery boards.'  One thing that I wish the product came with instead of being just in a thin protective case is a metal type case that fits the file perfectly (not letting it move around). If a case like that came with it instead of the thin clear wrap it would make it very easy to travel with (in your purse or diaper bag) because you wouldn't have to worry about it breaking. Also when at home if accidentally left out on the bed our sofa it and pressure is put on it without seeing it then it will break. The case would prevent that thus possibly make the product possibly last even longer.
B00AJSJE6O|5|Our son loves his Exersaucer, with his favorite activity area changing all the time. Very safe and secure, and keeps him amused for a decent period
B00LKC20Z0|5|Received this cup today and my little one loved it, she tends to spill drinks and with this one she didn't..The handles give the little ones an easy grip..Cute cup for the little ones!
B001N44UVW|2|We purchased this model because it had all of the features we wanted from a baby monitor. We thought we were getting the top of the line. The video is decent but the constant stream of interference is maddening! It screeches, pops, crackles and is sometimes so loud, you have to leave the volume all the way down and just keep checking the video. Every staticky noise registers on the light bar so interference can register as the baby crying at the top of the scale. I expected this item to work flawlessly given its high price tag, however it's like trying to watch an analog tv while moving the rabbit ears to get a clean signal. It requires too much effort for the cost. We've resorted to using our hand-me-down, audio only monitor as it works as intended. We would love to replace this with another model but we're afraid to spend the money for mediocre results.
B0045I6IA4|5|I love the colors of the pacis, and they are very durable.  My daughter loves their shape, and they are hard to lose because of their bright color.
B000324Y7U|5|This is something that I didn't think we needed, already having a swing, but I am glad that we made the buy. It is light, easy to put together, and the little guy likes the lights and especially the bubbles. The music is a lot like the other Fisher-Price products and he likes it. The first time we used the vibration it freaked him out, but on subsequent occasions he has liked it. <br />Like I said, it is light and stays out of the way. Its good to have other weapons in the arsenal.
B00B2G6OQA|5|Haven't used it in the oven yet but it is perfect for freezing puréed food. The lid helps prevent ice crystals too
B00FKXYY1I|4|Lightweight,easy to use, has alot of functionality, seems really sturdy and will last for a long time. My son is comfortable in it so is our neighbors kid as we let them use it too.<br /><br />I mean it is an umbrella stroller so it isnt as sturdy as a full jogging stroller BUT for sure its better than other umbrella strollers out there.<br />The &#34;Jeep&#34; moniker on there - has me scratching my head. I cant see jeep making this. Its gotta be anothe brand, that paid to have the jeep logo and name added to it.<br />Either way, real nice so far and i like the colors as does my wife.
B00F2MQ7XK|5|My son loves it!!!
B002UD6F3Q|4|Kids loved it.
B00UVXYUXE|5|Love it! I'm a car seat safety but and I really don't see how this could possibly mess up how a car seat works. You have to keep an eye on them and make sure it doesn't get around neck or anything but it works perfectly and my son will take 2-3 hour car naps now when we are on trips! With all kid items, you need to supervise.
B000058CC7|2|Extensions should automatically come with this gate because no one has a doorway small enough for the gate to work by itself.  The gate is flimsy if you extend the rods to the full capacity, so basically it doesn't extend to 34\\" without jeopardizing the security of the gate.  The gate only extends to 31\\" safely.  Overall I returned both gates for the Sure & Secure Extra Tall Gate which is better because the extensions were already included in the price.
B008DDPLEG|3|The pee guard is not tall enough for boys, and he pees out the front every couple of uses.  This is the main reason for 3 stars.  I keep the power switch off after the second day of use.  The water sensor on the bottom of the potty triggers the music immediately, and my son thinks he's done peeing, when he still has more to go.  The flushing lever is used as more of a toy for him now, so its not helpful.  The product still works as designed, no issues with that, but I think a basic potty with a taller pee guard would be more effective.  You can see the seat height differences in the picture and the pee guard differences between this and a very basic frog potty.
B00G4C0HEW|5|I was a little nervous about starting potty training since I'd heard more than my fair share of horror stories, but I really do think this chair made it easier. My son just turned 3, is pretty opinionated (stubborn) and is not prone to sticker charts. He also can be a tad anxious like his mom and was nervous to sit on the toilet. After his first try, he was completely comfortable and felt so grown up to sit on the &#34;big potty.&#34; The handles made him feel secure, and I love that I can grab it easily off the toilet when he's done. Splashing is not an issue because of the lip, and it's easy to wipe off. I live in a NY apartment which means space is precious, so the fact that the seat stands up on its own when you're not using it. Space is precious. I now tell all of my friends who are starting potty training to use this seat.
B0012E4FV8|4|Slides down the chair a bit but kept my child secure. A bit expensive in my opinion but it is the only choice out there.
B006P54WFI|4|It's a pressure gate.  It works.  The only thing better than this gate is the KidCo gates that are permanently mounted.
B00B652YQ6|5|Looks good in the nursery!
B0075M5GZ0|5|bought for my youngest granddaughter ,she loves it, just the right size for a baby and will grow with her
B0067GKHVS|5|This wipe dispenser is indispensable! I just ordered my third one. I keep one in my second floor nursery for diaper changing, one on my first floor for dirty hands and quick clean ups, and ordered one for my sister who is expecting. This works perfectly, one wipe at a time. I use BabyGanics thick n' kleen face, hand, & baby wipes. They come 100 in a pack and fit perfectly. My wipes stay fresh and moist. Even better, I can see when they are getting low! I highly recommend this product :)
B00IOS3OIK|5|quick delivery good quality !
B009YSYCZS|3|I like how this pump is made. It is easy to put together and all the parts clean very well. Unfortunately, the flange is too small for me, so it ends up being very uncomfortable and I cannot pump very much with it. If they had alternate sizes of flanges, I would really like this pump.
B00LYCR718|5|I have only washed them once so far but they washed well.  They are indeed very soft and are a great alternative to disposable wipes. They are also made out of very respectable materials. Customer service was very prompt and not a hassle.  Try it!
B00F0LDTJ8|4|We are the first time parents, and it took us a while to choose a right Infant car seat. After reading tons of reviews with all prons and cons, we decide to buy this one in RED (very cool color). Yes, it takes lots of space in the back, but I guess all infant car seats are like this due to the position it has to be in. The best thing is - it's very lightweight if you planning to carry around, and it compatible with many stroller including ours, of course through adapters.<br />However, once we were caught under the rain and of course it got wet. But after it dried out, seat was covered in dark stains like it was dirty. I hope stains will come off  after laundry, but this is unacceptable for that price. So, if you planning on purchasing one of this, choose the right color!
B00Z52R76S|5|Great product! We use it every day to check in on the baby. We started using it around 15 weeks and it worked perfectly. Definitely recommend this product for moms and dads who want to check in on their growing little one :)
B001W2YCG8|5|Great mattress, love that it is not filled with dangerous chemicals, since my baby will spend so much time on it; to us it was worth a higher price, plus it will also be used in the toddler phase;
B004Z9NIPQ|5|This item was purchased for my grand daughter who spends 4 days a week at our home. I am so impressed with this pail. First it holds a lot of soiled diapers. I kept it next to my sofa for a month so I could really see how good it was. I NEVER had a hint of bad smell and it was full of soiled diapers. When the lid closes it twists the bag closed and seals in any odors. And emptying it is also a breeze. You just snap shut the bag and pull it out of the front door and never notice any odors. Drop a new bag in and we are ready to go again.<br /><br />The only con I see to this is having to buy new bags, but I am so happy with the performance of this pail that I don't mind. It's worth it to have a clean, odor free system for disposing of Kirra's diapers. I would say this is a necessity for moms and grand moms.
B00A2HUFBA|3|Britax is a highly rated car seat.  Major disadvantage is it is very large and very heavy.  It is not a car seat that can be used as an infant carrier as it has no handle
B00F9Q3FPC|4|We bought this to use as a second seat. We have a marathon for daily use and LOVE it. This seat is almost exactly the same minus some nice bells and whistles on the marathon. I did experience the issue of not being able to get the straps up against my daughter, but after doing some research found if you clip the bottom buckle first, then tighten, then do the top buckle it really reduces this issue. I also find the infant insert strange but I am using it since it says it is required for children under 22 lbs. I like that the g4 series has all of the safety information on the side of the seat, because I would have assumed the pillow was just for newborns. One thing I wish Britax had was a ball level like other seats have telling you if you have the correct angle, not just the line--- regardless, I will only buy britax carseats with steel reinforcement (note the cheaper version of this seat does NOT have steel) I just think they are superior for safety.This is a great seat, like all britax seats it is easy to tighten straps and buckle in, and it is nice having a second seat that functions just like our primary Marathon. One issue that has bugged me is the pad that goes on the strap for in between her legs keeps coming off... it is just the little things like that that make this the budget option :)  People complain about the weight/height limits but my daughter is petite so I know she'll use this seat for a long time.
B00005BX8Z|3|My favorite thing about this mobile is that it plays classical music, and for about 15 minutes at a time!  My 1 month old daughter settles right down with the music and seems fascinated by the mobile...until the mobile stopped working!  Then I read some of the reviews and saw that others have had the same problem.  I thought about calling the company for a replacement motor for the mobile, but then I would still be supporting the company and this product.  So, my husband and I decided that we will get a different brand of mobile.  I have a music degree and have quite the collection of classical music, so I'm just going to make a CD for my daughter to listen to!
B001VDYF7Y|5|I love these prefolds! Very soft on baby's skin.thicker than the other prefolds  that I bought from the other organic brand. Absorbent, highly recommend! Perfect with wool diaper cover since wool can absorb some water without feeling wet. Better on baby's skin. One recommendation, buy from size 2 for 17lb or up since baby really grow very fast the first two to three months. And you as new parent is very busy and tired. The size 1 really last only in very short period.
B00KHR7JU0|5|My Grandson loves his chair.
B003C0CBM0|5|I love seeing my daughter when she uses these. Unless the team is having an off night... Heh. They are a middle size - not too small for a newborn, but not super big like the ones for toddlers are. I think the middle size is great and my 10 mo. old likes them.
B002UXQRDO|1|I tried these hoping to stop using disposables, I put them on and they were hard to shape to my not so small boobies but I was willing to look past that to save some money but after a few hours dd was hungry so I go to take the pad off and they were stuck to my already sore nipples. Ive tried them a few times and every time they stick to me and feel like sandpaper as soon as you leak and the milk dries. Deff do not recommend.
B004Y7WRII|5|this was my sons first stuffed animal. he loved the zebra on the mobile so i thought this would make him smile and indeed it did. this is a nice toy, large and stuffed very firm. he uses it as a body pillow and really loves this guy. i have used it a wedge for him too. success
B004FVNJYY|5|5 month old granddaughter smiled when she saw it, so I would say its great. She actually watches the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse show. Ears crinkle, rattle in tummy and almost as big as my granddaughter. Should last for a few years.
B000U5LXSS|4|I have mini dachshunds that shouldn't be going down the steep steps outside the door.  So I got a ramp (at my vet's suggestion) but they refused to go down the ramp.  The measurements of this extension fit perfectly, so I ordered it and even if it looks a little odd (it does match the limestone though) it did the trick.  The dogs use the ramp exclusively now and I am very happy.
B000JK148I|4|The Prenatal Heart Listener does work provided you know what to expect. You will not hear the choo choo beat of your baby as you do in the doctor's office using a Doppler. You will hear various thumping, rushing, and wooshing, which sounds are explained in the instruction manual. Initially, I was disappointed that it didn't sound like an actual heartbeat, but once I learned to recognize the various noises, I liked hearing my baby's noises, hiccups included!
B00008ODBG|2|I received this item as a gift and truthfully I dont think its worth it.  The wipes are cold by the time they hit the babys bottom.  Its just another thing to have hanging around the nursery to be plugged in. The latch on the warmer doesnt pop open when pressed and it doesnt close properly.  Not worth it!!
B000BF2V56|4|This product is pretty easy to use, and baby likes being wrapped up in it.  He sleeps soundly for a couple hours at a time (he's only a few weeks old) and I don't have to worry about anything coming undone to block his breathing.  Love the price too!
B004M5EKV4|5|We've had the pink and green polka dot diaper bag for 2.5 years and it looks as good as when we first bought it.  The size has been perfect too.
B00CZFAZGM|5|purchased for a shower gift. Expected mom loved it.
B000096LVC|5|These letters are thick and a perfect size for the bath. They are durable so if my baby decodes to chew on them I don't have to worry about them being a choking hazard! Highly recommended!
B001N2LWCO|1|This thing is terrible.  It shrunk to the point that it does not fit on the crib at all after ONE wash.  The part that goes under the mattress is a paper mesh type stuff that got holes in it during the fist wash.  I did not dry it. It is a much more yellow white than pictured.
B00PUXA90I|5|August Belle is a sweetie and is only 5' high!  Her little outfit is darling and it just makes her more precious!
B0085CBA90|5|Love it, love it, love it! Super comfortable, works with my medela pumping thingies, and my pumping bra. What more could I ask for? :)
B00CMR05I6|5|I made a good choice in getting this nipples for my sons bottles. I couldn't find them at walmart or target. I recommend it to parents with infants 3-6 months
B000LSL5ZK|5|These spoons are great for feeding time with my 5 month old.  They hold enough on the spoon for him to get a good bite!
B00GSM2D0E|5|Excelente
B00LHATUGW|4|Both my autistic 4 year old and 9 month old like these chewers. I do wish there was room to thread a baby ring through for the little one,  but it's not a deal breaker.
B00C5J3PR4|1|Cheaply made and not nice to look at. My kids hated sticking their hands in it. Save your money and buy something better
B00BV0EVE4|5|My 11 months old is a picky eater and was not eating as much as we wanted.  I opted to buy these plates to have her eating by herself and it did work.  As she cannot remove the plate from the tray, she focuses in grabbing her food and eating it!!! Great product.
B003Y3BGZ8|4|They do what they say they do....keep my daughters toys in reach so they don't get lost while on the go.
B00CWN8IK2|5|I really like this humidifer.  It is compact, easy to fill, quiet and it doesn't need a filter.  The previous reviews really helped me feel confident in my purchase.
B005DVU0J2|5|Good stuff,It was valuble! Good for kids!
B00LK5J73U|5|Love it! very useful!
B005SZKICW|5|We have one of their cute lunch boxes from the previous school year and are extremely pleased with how it held up. Several spills/leaks of food items and thermos (not skip hop brand) were easy to clean up.  The lunch box will get wet with major leaks, but it is easy to launder and looks like new each time.  The only reason we are getting a new lunch box for this year is to also have a matching backpack.
B008DDPL32|5|very cute and soft for our newborn. We bought this to put on the side of our bed after we co sleep those first few months. Once our daughter is use to the night time and can sleep on her own. We like how it folds up for travel and storing away when not in use. Overall very sturdy and functional.
B009AE77EO|5|I bought my baby the banana toothbrush teether and he loves it so I decided to buy him this one but he doesn't like it as much.  Of course that's his preference but I think it's really really cute.
B00JFUN6WK|4|My 17 month old loves this thing! He can play with it all by himself for long periods of time. My only complaint is that once you press the  big red button, the sequence does not last long enough - it should cycle through more than one little song.
B002WGI5NO|2|I wanted to like this so much and did LOVE it for the 1 hour it actually worked on the plane. By the end of my 2.5 hour flight, it has sprung a leak. The flight home, I had to keep refilling it with air. Needless to say, I had to return it. I really wish it would have worked as it's a great idea and stores nicely inside my diaper bag to be able to take this on the go.
B000ICZ9Y2|5|Thanks
B00JY6R1GC|5|so cute , and i think it will be a little bigger  for my 2 years old nephew~
B000WG1Y4S|5|If you have two children, this is a must-have stroller!  It is SO lightweight and SO easy to fold up.  I especially love it because it fits through most of my doors at home, so we can go for walks and if the kids fall asleep we can just let them sleep in there once we get home.  We use it jogging around the neighborhood as well.  The only downfall is the storage underneath is kind of a pain because it's kind of far in the front, but I wouldn't trade this stroller for anything.
B003BTXSCE|5|Works great for micropreemies
B00TUI4NZ6|1|About half of the bags in one package leak at the closure. The quality has gone down greatly while the price more than doubled. Don't let the thickness of the bag fool you.  Will try another brand next time.  As I've stopped breastfeeding and am using the frozen milk I'm finding that (no exaggeration) out of 15 bags 13 have leaked. I'm more than slightly pissed.
B001OCE15S|4|I PURCHASED 4 OF THESE 6 MONTHS AGO AND THEY WORK GREAT. I BOUGHT THEM BECAUSE MY BABY KEPT  HITTING HER MOUTH AND HEAD ON THE TOP RAIL WHEN SHE WAS STANDING UP. HOWEVER THIS WOULD WORK WELL FOR KIDS THAT ARE BITING THE RAIL TOO. THEY ARE PADDED AND SOFT. I HAVE A PORTABLE CRIB WHICH IS SMALLER THAN A STANDARD CRIB SO I CUT 2 OF THEM IN HALF AND QUICKLY HAND SOWED THE EDGE TO COVER THE SIDE RAIL. FOR THE FRONT RAIL, I JUST FOLDED THE SIDES UNDER A LITTLE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO LONG. THEY WORK GREAT AND THE CREAM COLR MATCHES WITH A LOT OF COLORS. THEY LOOK NICE ON THE CRIB. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 4 STARS IS BECAUSE THE HOLES THAT YOU PUT THE STRING THROUGH TO LACE IT ON THE RAIL DO NOT HAVE A DOUBLE SEEM AROUND THE HOLE SO THEY EASILY RIP IF YOU PULL TOO TIGHT. IF THAT DETAIL WOULD'VE BEEN SOWN TO BE MORE DURABLE, I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS. ALSO, I HAD TO CALL THE COMPANY FOR DETAILS AND MEASUREMENTS, AND THE COSTUMER SERVICE WAS GOOD. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE A LITTLE PRICEY. IT IS TRUE THAT IT DOES TAKE A LONG TIME AND WORK TO TREAD THE STRINGS THAT TIE THE CUSHION ONTO THE RAIL, BUT ONCE IT IS ON, IT SURE IS TIGHT,
B0082I1IA8|5|We lover these binkys.  Our son has used sever different ones but we found that other brands can get water in the nipple when washed and I always fear there will be bacteria that grows.  These are great and very cute.  Our son is 11 months so we will be retiring these soon but we have another baby due in April and plan to start using MAM from the start.
B005KBU5PO|5|Another great toy I used to wrap a baby shower gift to outside of package. Nursery theme is Safari animals and this just fit into that category nicely. Baby will love it!
B004GE8J54|5|This nibbler with cap is very beautiful.my duaghter like it very much,this is very facility<br /><br />I love it ,so.you should buy it
B0025YWL4W|4|I purchased these liners to use with our Bumgenius 3.0 one sized diapers.  These are used when we need to use diaper creme to prevent/heal a rash.  Using diaper creme with microfiber diapers can cause \\"repelling\\".  We use the large liners and haven't had any trouble.
B0016C1C44|5|I bought this changing pad (in Lime) when I was pregnant.  I loved the color, shape, etc.  I've used it since we came home from the hospital.  My son loves it.  He will lay there no problem while I change him/dress him.  I like that I don't need a cover and that cleanup is a breeze for when you have a blowout or they like to spray ;-).  He lays on it content, and for the middle of night changes, he will often stay half asleep when I lay him on it to change.  I recommend it to anyone!
B003VNKLI4|1|Aweful experience - This product was rated as like new....came without the bracket mounts and instructions.  How is that like new.  What a hoax.  I had to pay for 1 day shipping to get a new replacement and in the end this product is not as adaptable to many configurations as it claims.  The wall mounts would not stick out far enough to fit our thick floor molding.  The bannister brackets only fit a bannister exactly like the photo above - forget it if your bannister is thicker or square.  Too bad, I can't find a product that has the flexibility to fit our top of stair issue.
B007LXMQRY|5|This is my favorite changing pad cover that I have. It is incredibly soft and doesn't get overly hot or cold with temperature changes in our house. It is adorable cute as well. Easy to clean and holds up well. Overall, a very good product.
B00064MUQC|4|My grandaughter has two of these type of books and really doesn't use them. This one is very cute, crinkles nicely and is a good size for baby hands and mouth! However they are not her favorite toy.
B00E8KJYNC|4|I am surprised this product gets so many negative reviews, but it works really wonderful for me.    It does everything I would expect when I see its name \\"formula maker\\". I regret that I didn't know this product during my baby's first month.It would save the new parents tons of energy if we bought it before baby is born.    I did read most of the negative reviews. The main problem they mentioned is formula clogged in the dispenser. I followed the instruction to clean the funnel everyday, wipe clean the bottom of the dispenser, and put the funnel back after it is completely dry. The formula never clogged in my machine.    Another thought maybe the formula brand. I use Similac Advance. Maybe other brand is easier to clog?    I give 4 star because I do hope the company improve some minor issue:  1. provide 1oz increment instead of 2oz. My baby eats 4oz per meal right now, but I don't think he can eat 6oz right away. It would be nice if there is a 5oz option.  2. a little too noise. Winter is coming and I move the machine to our bedroom to ease the midnight feeding. I didn't feel it is noisy when it was in the kitchen, but in a quite bedroom in the midnight, it is quite noisy.    Bottom line and hint: your local R us store is probably selling this machine too. It is not hard to find a 20% coupon:) And, if it really doesn't not for you, you can easily return it.
B00MIBUZHW|4|A little Creapy lookin' but my 6-mo old seems to like it.
B002QYW8LW|5|Great Item
B00HPQTJ18|5|I purchased this stroller because it had a good rating and it has lived up to that rating. It was affordable and not as flimsy and cheaply made as the $20 strollers at my local Walmart. I needed something a bit more durable that my son wouldn't have a fit sitting and riding in and this stroller fits the bill.
B00393C04E|5|We purchased the Skip House pink mouse backpack, and were looking for a coordinating lunch bag. We bought the Skip Hop Penguin Lunch Bag.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />My daughter was wild about the penguin design. It is incredibly cute! (They all are, honestly.)<br /><br />I loved that it is BPA-, Phthalate-, and PVC-free.<br /><br />It's very easy to clean the inside. Wipes down very quickly with a damp cloth.<br /><br />Internal name tag space.<br /><br />Adjustable carry handle<br /><br />Can be laid flat and unzipped all the way around. for easier unpacking at lunchtime.<br /><br />INTERNAL FIT:<br /><br />It has a small mesh pocket on the inside where I tuck her fruit strip, or pack of cheese bunny crackers, and a folded up napkin and her ID card. The main internal portion easily holds our square sandwich container, small container of crackers/cookies, and a Contigo Autoseal Kids Cup.<br /><br />POTENTIAL CONS:<br /><br />It does not easily hold the shorter/fatter food containers (wide thermos-style). Nor does it easily hold a small yogurt, mini ice pack, water bottle, AND a plastic sandwich container. But if you pack your sandwiches in those small reusable bags, that might work for all the extras,  though the sandwich might be a bit smushed. ;)<br /><br />I really wish it had an external pocket (like the Skip Hop backpacks have). The inner mesh pocket is good for a few things, but not a lot.<br /><br />Does not hold afternoon snack and lunch. Not an issue for us, but might be a concern for others.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />I highly recommend this for a single lunch container for a young child (preschool or kindergarten). We keep her snack in her regular backpack, so this one works fine for lunch only.<br /><br />5 stars because it works great for our needs, and our daughter absolutely adores it. :)<br /><br />But once she's older, we'll be moving on the a larger lunch bag. She'll be very sad to not be able to bring her Penguin buddy to school. But for this year, it's perfect!
B0020727N4|5|Our son is in construction, we had bought this set in yellow for our grandson and when we saw it in pink, had to buy it for our granddaughter. They love using them. What a fun way to eat.
B0053OSS2K|3|Smaller size than expected. Never had a chance to use it because it was uncomfortably small when received.
B003G2YUU0|4|I'm so glad I got this for my 2-month old. He can't take away his eyes from it. For the price it's really a steal. The only con: the strap on the back is quite short - our crib has a tall headboard, and it barely fits it. Also, this product is really for convertible cribs with a headboard on the side, otherwise the mobile might be too low and dangerous for the baby.
B000747O6W|5|My son had this when he was a baby.  One thing as a new parent, you worry about things breaking off into a baby's mouth causing a choking hazard.  This is a durable toy and perfect size for small baby hands. Soft and durable for repeat washing.  I tended to add mine in a pillowcase when washing and drying.  Now 16 years later, a co-worker expecting a child, I gifted her this size and the next one up to allow growing. These were my son's favorite comfort toys.
B00005V6C8|2|I loved my Diaper Dekor for the first six months while my son was exclusively breastfed.  But once we started solids, it didn't seem to work at all.  Now I have to either put dirty daipers in a plastic bag before putting them in the pail, or throw them away somewhere else.  I still like the ease of the system, but a trashcan with a lid would be just as easy and work just as well.<br />Also, my 13 month old son can take things out and throw things into the Diaper Dekor by himself.  That's great for him to feel like he is helping after his diaper is changed, but it means I can't leave the thing out, which makes it pretty inconvienient to use.  Other models I've seen don't have that problem, so in the end, I wish I'd gone with something else.
B001O2AJKE|5|I bought these cloths for my daughter to give to an elderly woman who is bed bound.  The woman wanted something thin and very soft.  The woman loved these so much that we bought her a second set.
B0007CS4EU|5|These are great.  I feel comfortable freezing milk and homemade baby food.  We bough 4 trays and constantly have them rotating with new foods. Great, highly recommend!
B00LIX3AW8|4|Super, super cute chest... but unfortunately there was staining on the lid.
B000HEE73K|2|Th strap covers are absolutely adorable and very soft.  The only problem is that they are SO thick!  Much too thick for a newborn.
B000W8PZ0A|2|I should have listened to the other reviewers, because the size of this is ridiculous. I got a 12-18 month size (my son wears 24 month clothing) and it is gigantic.
B00HAZSC3K|5|Safe and a good weight for warmer seasons.
B001TXZEWG|5|These sheets worked wonderfully on the new mattress purchased for my 50 year old bassinete.  Very nice for the need.
B002QYW8LW|5|My son started enjoying this teether at 5 months and it's still going strong!  I will say it is extemely sticky and picks up every speck of dirt/dust, so I end up cleaning it a lot, but it's worth it.  We don't actually use it as a toothbrush at all.  Just fun to gum on.
B002FKAMJ2|5|I ordered the Edushape Edu-Tiles 36 Piece 6x6ft Play Mat, Letters & Numbers Set. These really finished the look. Exactly what I expected.
B000AV5LZ8|5|My two-year-old loves this seat! It makes it so easy for her to get on the potty by herself and gave her enough feeling of independence to want to use the potty instead of going in a pull-up. Highly recommend for anyone potty-training!
B00IOGJ9AO|5|This tub is great value for the money. I had another tub I paid more for, but it was not as large and the quality was no good. It cracked the second time I used it, so I bought this one and have been using it even since. The feet keep it really stable and the drain plug is convenient as well. For the price, I don't think you can go wrong with this one.
B001LONW40|5|great value!  very nice
B004U5FPOC|5|Cutest backpack!  It is small, so don't expect to be an adult and comfortably wear it.  I use it for a purse.  I just love it.
B00G5JWON6|5|Wife got it using my account.  She seems happy with them, happy wife, happy life.
B000MQQR9U|3|Great Idea, but I didn't even open the packaging because it came in pink rather than a neutral color.  Kind of sucks I couldn't choose a color or I would have actually kept the item.
B0001CTZ8K|3|The product was in good condition, easy transaction. The only thing was that I ordered the wrong product by this company and they don't carry what I was really looking for. Otherwise, the product was in good condition.
B00FQUBO3G|4|I Can't use them in my kitchen because my handles are too close together for the smallest setting and in the bathroom the handles are too far apart, so make sure you measure before ordering.
B00F9Q3ETE|4|All in all this thing is great but it fits awkwardly on the BOB Motion stroller.
B0052QYLUM|4|The camera resolution is actually very good. I was surprised at how crisp the image was. Also, the range was a very important part of this item. I was concerned that it wouldn't work from my son's upstairs bedroom to our downstairs bedroom. There is no issue there either. I am very happy with this purchase.
B000LZDUJ2|1|Strap broke and if folds over making it pointless
B002MQFGY0|1|when I bought this nursing tank I thought it would be easy to use, instead every time I want to nurse I have to take the whole strap down because the opening is not big enough and it does not stay out of the way. Maybe it will work for big breasts but not for medium or small. I hated this tank and I do not use it anymore.
B00EIGLTQ6|5|Was perfect and a great price. Came quickly and she loves it :)
B000ZYM8TW|5|These were one of my son's favorite toys, but we lost the first pair. They're easy to hold, brightly colored, great to chew on, and fun to bang against stuff. Keeps my 8 1/2 month old entertained.
B00BOSTN46|5|We received this as a gift and my son loves it.  I love that it is made in the USA and proceeds go towards benefiting autism research.
B000S9RF4M|4|I'm not sure why, but our little one just doesn't seem to like this much. The configuration of the clamps and joints is great though and I intend to bring it back out when he is older (he is 4.5 months now).<br />Seems well made, is very cute, and attaches to practically anything - even to odd angles because of the joints.<br />I have faith that he will probably warm up to it ina fe weeks.
B007C2R3AE|5|also recommended by police to prevent window entry.
B00P11BUZC|5|This mat is well made and so cute! My daughter was thrilled.  We've received serveral complements from other parents too. Great purchase.
B0031QPN66|5|I absolutely love this chair and ottoman combination.  I bought it for our baby's nursery before she was born and a year and a half later, it is still super comfy.  The fabric is durable and easy to clean up too (we've had a few accidents with a new baby).  It's a very smooth rocker that doesn't make any noise.  The color was neutral and it matched the furniture in the room.
B00A4L7GOI|5|I tried a couple of different other cloth diapers with my son and they either were a pain to put on and/or leaked. I gave up on them for awhile, and decided to try this brand. This is an awesome diaper! I bought more and hopefully will go all cloth within the next month or two!
B004FVNJYY|5|He may be only a 1 year old but he knows what he likes, and Mickey Mouse is it for him these days.
B00BJCFOYK|1|My child was 7 pounds at birth.  This insert was not worth the packaging it came in.  The ergobaby is well designed and did not need the insert to fit the small child.
B0002PR43O|5|Completely satisfied with the product!  My daughter loves it!  It is very colorful and keeps my daughter very entertained!  I definitely recommend this product!
B000056C86|5|Absoulutely, amazingly, NICE!!!    It is so colorful all around and roomy, our baby loves it!    Best of all the playyards that we saw when we shopped around.
B0002JETPQ|4|Great gate for your money. Super big exactly what we were looking for.  Recommend this gate for those large spaces and it's very durable.
B00DHINGD0|5|I'm a mom of now 4 kids & having to buy a new stroller with every child because they all break I researched strollers for months while pregnant I read the reviews on this stroller on every website it is sold as well as watched you tube videos. Well I've been using it now for 4 months with the car seat & with out & I am so in love with the stroller & here's why<br />1. It's super light weight, spins on a dime, super easy to push with 1 hand, ( so easy that you have to remember to put the brake on)<br />2. Fits in trunk space perfect, easy 1 hand collapsing (easy enough my 10 year old does it)<br />3. Super durable both frame & cloth easy to clean off dirt<br />4. Canopy & under storage are big enough ( highly recommend buying the parent storage for the top holds cups well plus hidden storage.<br /><br />All in all this stroller is great for a great price<br />Don't recommend the car seat but that is the only stroller that fits I the stroller<br />The car seat is first & for most very heavy over 10 lbs without baby!!!! The does not come off easily from base in car does not feel very secure when the car seat is in base<br />When the base is alone in the car with out the seat in it it rattles allot.<br />The latch to remove the car seat from base is not the same as the latch to remove from stroller which is really dumb. If I had a chose to keep this awesome stroller & not the car seat I would but I love the stroller too much.
B005UBCKES|5|A consumer magazine that shall remain nameless, ranked these as the safest car seat. That's what I wanted for my grandson. His parents though love it because they said it's easy (relatively) to install and he is comfortable in the seat.  He was involved in a minor accident while in this seat and had no ill effects. It did it's job.
B000K53UEI|5|This worked well for it's intended purpose, it sat by the sink for 2 years and was used constantly to dry bottles and sippy cups and tops.
B003EUEOPK|5|i used at my 4 years-old bathroom and he loves his own aquarium, all the kids love it and we coordinated it with his bath toys.
B00L2FPBXS|3|It's great except it's too short to fit around my daughter's head.
B00F1CPBQ0|5|Trust all the reviews and buy this mobile.  We have it on our newborn's FP Rock n Play, which we use during the day, and she loves it!  We love it too as it provides stimulation that helps promote the development of her eye muscles as she follows the animals going around.  Each animal has a patch of black and white on it, which helps the little ones follow them since they can see the high color contrast more easily than other colors that their newborn eyes simply blend together. Whether you're buying it for yourself or a friend you won't be disappointed!
B002DYIIIM|5|I love this. I bought it back in 2009. And still use it for my son. Never had any problems with it. Deff worth it<br /><br />Update. This product is still working great. My sons almost 4 now and it still works no problems. We now use it for both him and his sister.
B00A6F2QJC|5|I pump at work and I need to clean the accessories 4 times a day while I am in the office with more people. I leave the accessories under water with this Soap, then I rinse and all done! Then I put them on the steam bag. After 5 minutes, I have everything clean and ready to use again.
B0054QOIKS|4|Cute little toy. It crinkles. It squeaks. Its soft. And has a small mirror. Covers all basics. Good fidget toy to keep in the diaper bag. Plus it easily attaches to a paci chain for safe keeping.
B00KCNIOOY|5|Love the one piece design and very easy to clean.
B004UUHRL6|4|The costume idea is adorable, but I just feel that it was poorly made.  The stitching, especially around the collar, was loose and showed on both sides, so that it looked like both sides were inside out.  I know I only paid $30 for it, but I still feel like the craftsmanship was poor.
B005MZ0V7K|4|These little containers are great for storing baby food. Each one holds about one serving. It is nice to make enough for a couple od days this makes it easy because there is a dial on the lid with the days of the week. So if you make something one day, and something else the next day, it makes it easier to know how long you have had it.
B003XMWFBE|2|I got 1 for each seat of my car. On the side where my 3yo sits, the organizer tore at the top within a month or 2. The other one, which my 10yo uses, did not. The kids still throw their stuff on the floor a lot but it's good for cleaning up the car fast without sorting through everything. Also my kids seem to like to use the pockets as cup holders. I did want it to hold papers and they don't hold them well.
0980027594|5|I bought my son 1st and 2nd year calendars because I thought it would be easier to jot down day to day things...We are almost at the end of this 2nd year one and love it!  It has places for pictures and cute little sayings or memories.  I'm really happy with it!!
B009UQPSE8|5|Give great lighting in a dark room. I love how it has a light sensor. Great purchase. I want to buy more for the rest of the house!
B00A67C57S|4|We bought this car seat based on the good reviews for safety side impact--and so far we haven't had any accidents and hopefully won't with our precious cargo. We got the Beaumont style to match our car and it is a perfect match and is a great gender neutral color and style. It's pretty comfortable with enough padding and even comes with a pillowy soft attachable headrest and infant head support One thing with this Beaumont style I do not like is it doesn't come with the seat belt covers that the other models come with and I wish it did because the belts are pretty snug on my son's neck so I had to buy some covers separately which was an inconvenience. Also I don't like the style of the infant head support because it is not as cushiony as the other styles so it really doesn't offer the head support you would need, especially when our son falls asleep his head tilts forward and has no side support, another item we had to buy to fix this issue. We were using the typical car seat with carrying handle and decided to get this one so our now 7 month old son can use it until he is of booster seat age, but is now still using it as a rear-facing. Using it in the rear-facing position is quite large and we have a newer model station wagon that was super spacious with the older car seat, but now we had to move the passenger seat all the way forward and seat fully upright for this car seat to recline correctly. I don't know if this car seat would be a comfortable ride for a newborn, although it says it can seat a 5 lbs. and up infant, it seems better suited for an infant that can be in a sitting position. The reclining lever is very easy to use, the seat belt harness adjustment is easier than older car seat models, and attaching the anchors from the base to the car was easy too but we had to add a rolled up blanket to level the car seat to the correct line for the rear-facing. I can't wait to use it forward-facing because I think it would eliminate most or all of the issues I currently am frustrated with. So if you are considering this car seat, it is great and well-made, but look closely at the pictures and description when choosing a style, not just based on color but also features/accessories it may come with.
B001L61286|5|Love this net!
B0010WFVRO|5|I am babysitting a very \\"fussy\\" 4 month old...I purchased this hoping she would like it...so loves it!!! It's well made also. The one downfall is it will only go on certain door frames, lucky for me my daughters home where I babysit has old door frames, it would never work here in my home.
B001OC5UMQ|4|I REALLY LIKE IT. IT WORK EXCELLENT FOR MY PET AND MY BABY. I LOVE AND I WILL RECOMEND IT 99.9%.
B000LF17GK|5|It met my expectations and was of very good quality.  Highly recommend for this type of high chair.
B002RP0S5I|4|Bought one of these to help organize my cloth diapers, since it is on the small side (the size of a nightstand) I'll need to order a second one but it was easy to put together and will serve the purpose. Wish the color on the fabric was deeper (its a washed out brown) b/c it would make it look less cheap but still think its a cute storage option. If you are on a budget and want to avoid plastic bins etc with a small space this is a good option.
B004T8NRPE|5|I use these to clean my metal and reusable straws~ awesome. I am very happy with this purchase with I am sure you will be as well!
B0019RW36W|5|I got this bouncer from my mother. She bought it to use with my neice and It is the itsy bitsy blue version and it is so solid and well built and the detachable washable fabric holds up so well and doesnt' show wear after many washings. Baby recently tried to flip it (we are not going to use it anymore he is now 4 months) but it wouldn't budge. the legs on this baby are 3 times as thick and sturdy as a bright *wallyworld* starts brand. We needed 2 of about everything since we have a huge staircase in our home. battery pack is great. We used this hours a day and only changed batteries about on average once a month! Invest! This is going to be the most used thing you buy in the beginning. It is a Sturdy little work horse. I am missing it already. I will hold on to this for the next kid for sure.
B001TXZGH4|5|I bought this a replacment for a  cradle my mother had made for me when I had my 22yr old son. Now my great niece sleeps great.
B00CBVHLWQ|2|I've been happy with this high chair until my daughter had a huge blowout in it this morning.  I took the cover off to wash it (great!), but when I looked to see how to take the lap straps off (which were victims of the blowout), I realized they cannot be removed!!!  That's a huge design flaw in my opinion.  Babies spill, spit up, have blowouts, etc. and the straps should be removable so as to be thoroughly cleaned.
B001AH8JNC|1|I received this watch and it was dead on arrival. I opened it up and put in new batteries. It then would turn on, but the second I closed the case it stopped functioning and gave me an error message. It does not even keep time it is just a potty timer. So if you want a timer that has an exposed computer chip on your toddlers wrist then this is the product for you!
B0000479VK|5|Does the job. Doesn't last forever, but, it works fine and is inexpensive and easily replaced with all the drill holes inside the cabinet, so, once removed, no mark. Cabinet can only turn one way, now, but, you get so used to it, I forgot about it until I read another review. The important thing is that there is no \\"play\\" in the door--no pinched fingers. This only works on cabinets with a fixed \\"L\\" shape door that attaches to the shelving and goes around inside the cabinet. I'd prefer something unseen, but, have never found something for the lazy susan that is as safe. I installed ours at the bottom, which at least makes it less seen.
B000JVXZGG|4|Not bad. Is exactly what it says it is.<br />My daughter didn't take to the reward system so was a waste of money.<br />But once I stopped trying to train her to early she was trained within a weekend ! She's 3 now. Was trained last year sometime.  Like probably 28 months old? I know she was like over 2 but under 3. Don't try to early you will drive yourself nuts!
B00KHZPH74|5|This was the perfect transition between swaddling and a sleep blanket. It got us through a rough 1-2 month period that would have been much worse without it. It looks really warm, but our kids slept in them in summer in 75-78 degree rooms without issue.
B008KCR7VK|5|My wife and I purchased this as an addition to the britax B safe and B agile carseat stroller combo. As far as a carseat base goes, this base could not be any simpler to install. It has two seat belt style latches that attach to d rings that are found attached to the seat frames of most modern cars. Simply click them into place, tighten the tensioning strap and your ready to go. If your vehicle doesn't have the securing rings in the seat, the base also leaves a gap in which any lap belt will slide through.
B007JDNDPA|4|a little smaller than expected, but cute as a newborn gift.
B000F1SCJK|2|So I was hoping that this bag would be the answer to the big bag vs little bag dilemma . . . Great concept, but poor execution. Both the buckle clips do not hold well, I can snap them open by just pulling on the flap instead of actually pushing the buckle together - not great if you plan to attach to anything like a stroller, or even to hold the bag closed when a bit full.  Also don't like how it bulks up easily with just a few items in all the compartments. Still searching for a perfect nappy wallet then . . .
B00G6AJYPK|5|I like them because they're like the old fashioned thick pins
B004NRNSRI|5|This bath is the perfect combination between beauty and practicity. It holds a lot of water and my toddler felt super comfortable in it. totally recomended. loved it!
B00005BLMG|3|You must order 2 kits if you need to provide shade for 2 car windows.  I thought the word 'kit' implied that it contained everything I would need. Not so.  I'll probably just order another one instead of having 2 different shades, but who would ever need just 1.  Weird way to package this product in my opinion.
B000SMWUPS|5|I love my Britax stroller, but was lost without a drink/ wallet holder on top. This thing fits easily, works perfectly. It has a drink holder on each side and a small zipper/ mesh compartment for a few dollars in the middle open area.<br /><br />The canvas seems to wash up well. Very durable and practical. Our handle for our stroller flips down to bring the stroller up to you when sitting. This flips over the handle to hang on the handle in both positions.<br /><br />I would recommend also purchasing a similar thing for baby when he/she is older if you have the Britax stroller (or similar).<br /><br />I like the tasteful, simple black, but would have preferred some color/ pattern options. Or, maybe even a more intricate picture on one side for the baby to stare at...just a thought :).
B007HKOL92|5|I would recommend these to anyone with a baby! They work great and are easy to take apart and clean.
B003ULP592|5|Easy to install, and the directions included are easy to follow. We are using it on our convertible Sorelle Princeton crib. Excellent quality, and it is tall and sturdy enough to do a good job of keeping my restless sleeper in his bed at night.
B00JV9INP0|5|Great carrier! I had the name brand version and hated it... this is more comfortable. The stitching is X stitched and is decent quality. Can't go wrong.
B007E5B8UU|5|These burp cloths are a great buy! They are super soft, even after months of washing. My baby has very sensitive skin, especially on his face, and these cloths are silky and smooth, never irritating. Great price, too!
B001QXCG3O|3|I purchased this for the great cool colors and features. Car Seat is very nice and I loved the easy to use recline feature. But, this is a smaller model car seat.   Would be great for a smaller baby or newborn. A larger baby/toddler may have a tighter fit. I do not see how you would fit a child over the age of 2yrs or 30lbs or more in this seat.  Also very hard to to adjust the strap height on this. This does come latch equipped, but we own an older car that does not have the latch system. It is VERY difficult to install rear facing using the car's own seat belt.
B0093DOY0C|4|I think for a teether, its a little pricey. DS likes it but its not a favorite. Like most babies, he chews on anything you give him, so he doesn' t have a favorite. I have found he likes to chew on hard items/toys more than soft, not sure why. However, I like it when he has the jChew because he is wild with is arms and when he has a hard toy he often hits himself in the face, with this one it won't hurt him. Wash it often though because it's always falling everywhere. If you can afford a $15 teether it's probably worth it.
B004GIFIMW|4|very cute
B005WHQL54|5|MY EVALUATION (briefly)<br />As the parent of... quite a few kids and having used at least half a dozen different car seats over the years (counting the booster seats) I feel that I can state with confidence that this one - My Ride 65 - is way up there when it comes to design, quality and, equally important, safety.<br /><br />I won't say that this is the best car seat your money can buy because deciding which one is better when comparing largely similar product can be subjective but I can say that the product is worth the money spent because the seat is meant to 'grow' with your kid and it supports children up to 65 lbs. It's unlikely that you will need another for your kid as he/she grows.<br /><br />One note of caution: this car seat is... big. If you are planning to use it in a very small car, make sure that you can return it after you open the box and try it out because it just might not fit very well.<br /><br />MY INVESTIGATION<br />There are two main configurations: rear-facing (4 to 40 lbs.) and forward-facing (20 to 65 lbs.) I didn't test the rear-facing configuration with a baby but I did go through the two installation procedures for both configuration and tested the forward-facing with an actual passenger.<br /><br />I wish I could state otherwise but setting it all up is not 'easy', which explains the 56-page manual. There are many options and configurations and the makers expect you to follow everything to the letter if you want your baby to be protected rather than harmed by the seat. I found that doing it all 'by the letter' can be quite time consuming (1-2 hours for each of the 4 configurations I tested) but it absolutely worth the time because you only do two major installations (with adjustments as your kid grows) for the seat's lifecycle.<br /><br />On each of the 4 installations we ended up with an extremely comfortable and protective seat. I was confident that a child will be as safe as one can reasonably expect given the circumstances of a moving vehicle.<br /><br />THE MANUAL<br />As I mentioned before, following the manual to the letter is critical. This is a complex product and the expectations are high for a product that's expected to protect and even save a child's life. I am pleased to say that the English/Spanish, 56 pages for the English version only manual is very well written and, while there are many considerations and many steps to take during installation and operation, everything is well explained and well illustrated.<br /><br />The manual discusses all the options when it comes to installation, the things to consider (airbags) BEFORE placing a child in the seat, the do's and don'ts of installation and maintenance. Again, the manual covers a lot of ground but I am happy that all the details are there. It should be kept as a reference for as long as one has the seat because I can see myself getting back to it every time I need to make an adjustment just to make sure that I do it right.<br /><br />INSTALLATION<br />The basic configurations are rear and forward-facing configurations anchored with either LATCH or the seatbelt. Then, there are various adjustments such as picking the right strap slots, adding or removing the head or body support, etc.<br /><br />Installation too a log time for the first configuration because I had to get used to using the manual and become familiar with the seat's design but I never felt that I was doing anything unnecessary. Everything was covered by the manual to the right level of detail.<br /><br />OPERATION<br />Once all is in place, it's as easy and getting the child into the seat and tightening the seatbelt. While it's likely to become better or more efficient at taking the seat in and out of your car I would not recommend doing this very often. This seat is complicated and bulky and I would get two of them if my child was to ride in two vehicle.<br /><br />Graco recommends that you place 'something' like a towel underneath to protect your car seat and our past experience agrees with that. The manual is very good at explaining how to clean the product but we didn't try that yet.<br /><br />DESIGN AND COMFORT<br />My Ride 65 is comfortable and protective. There is a lot of padding and the various attachments, adjustments and seating configurations should have any child riding comfortably and safely up until the time they don't need a car seat any longer.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT<br />After testing this product, if I was seeking another car seat I would pick this one again without hesitation if I could afford it. The product appears to be safe, comfortable and built to last.ur past experience agrees with that.

B000067UY7|4|These pillows are so expensive! But, I guess considering the fact that I used it every night during my first pregnancy and am using it every night now that I'm pregnant again, it was worth the money. The pillow could be a bit firmer in my opinion as the filling has started to separate and I have to smoosh it up towards the front to get the head support I want. In doing so, the portion that is supposed to go between your legs is getting flatter and flatter. I may have to open this puppy up and fill it with some polyfill to beef it up again.
B0056Z2BTM|2|they don't state its size but it's a mini bag<br />a diaper bag that probably won't be able to fit just teh baby bottles<br />i'll need to use both sizes to just be able to put the necessities
B0049I2FO8|5|Works perfect to air up stroller tires! I love the size too! We have it with us at all times!
B006ZISU76|2|GREAT configuration but it was long and heavy. I had trouble getting it latched to close and that is why I returned it. If it doesn't close the 1st time, I have two small kids, too much work for me and i don't have time to fuss with it.
B002L3T6AO|4|We got this travel system because it was rated so well by Consumer Reports and also because a friend recommended it and we have not been disappointed. I have used this stroller twice a day every day for ten months and it is a serious workhorse. It has made the trip from Southern California to New York getting tossed around at airports, with no problems. My only 'complaints' would be it is a little on the heavy side ( but that is probably part of why it is so durable) and I don't think the stroller part was padded enough for my little guy ( I ran out to a fabric store and got some foam to add extra padding and now it is SUPER comfy for him) Car seat is great all around. We could have gone more expensive ( way more when you see what's out there) or cheaper, but this has been a great buy.
B0031ES8UG|5|I bought one and a couple of months after bought two more.<br />My grandaughter loves it and I did not want to be out of stock.<br />She started using it close to her after beeing born ( small , no chances of sufocation) and now eight months after she crows looking for it
B007BYN460|5|Oh I love this thing! The musical mobiles you buy now a days you still have to wind. My sons broke and would only spin half way and stop. So I was searching for a new piece and I came across this one! It has a green button to turn it on and a red button to stop, how awesome! It just goes as long as you need it to. I love that! It goes a bit slow, but my son loves it, so mommy is happy :-)
B00011F5US|4|This doll is as expected.  It's for my two month old niece so I'm hoping she grows into playing with it at the appropriate time.  It's a soft doll with no parts on it that seem like they could come loose.
B008D1HFCY|1|Item purchased has a severe crease down the middle from being folders in order to shop at a reduced rate. Unhappy with that aspect!
B005UVR0N4|5|We just recieved this travel system today and it is gorgeous! I searched online for a few months looking for a good stroller but always knew in the back of my head that it would be a graco since I have had nothing but great experiences with Graco products and strollers. I am so happy that I chose this system and I can't wait to use it for real in 4 months! The design and colors on it are beautiful and work for a boy or a girl. I highly recommend this system!
B0038JE63W|5|well made & seems likely to last, does it's job well.  will consider another for the automobile.  perfect for small tight areas
B004HFQOMW|3|One bottle record is smashed and not clear,the others stuff are still fine.But to avoid the exchanging trouble.I had keep them.
B003XLIXYI|5|Excelente.<br /><br />Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.<br />Do compare to similar products and share how long you've used this product.<br />Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort & fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.
B0029009TG|5|Even at the young age of five, my granddaughter loved this! It looks great in her room. It should last quite a while.
B00NF9KKLC|2|Not worth the price IMO. It's a good umbrella stroller but still too flimsy wheels to warrant the price tag
B001KZH69C|5|This organic mattress cover is so soft!I will def buy another one. And i also use the Amercian baby's mattress sheet. It feels the same way too. Love it!!!!!!!!!Best purchase on Amazon!
B001UFD2ZO|5|Seriously, I have been extremely skeptical of this thing since my daughter was born. She is now almost 2 1/2. She has a really bad cold and can barely breathe because of all the junk. I finally broke down and decided to try it, considering my only other option was to rig the family vacuum cleaner. I now feel like a bad parent for not having gotten it before! We went from needing two people to pin her down so we could aspirate, to just me with her sitting up while she presses the button and giggles, cuz it tickles! My life with her would have been so much easier had I just gone ahead and gotten before.        It works wonderfully. The suction is good enough to pull boogies (and any other lovely junk!) but not so much that it will pull out any brain cells, lol, I would totally use it on tiny babies. Make sure, if there is congestion along with the nose problems that you use saline before using the aspirator, as doing without makes it uncomfortable for the baby.   I noticed the first time i used it, it worked great, however, after I cleaned it, not so much. After reading the instructions I found you are supposed to hear a tiny click, to make sure the reservoir is in place, I guess I didn't push it hard enough. It is not so much a click but a fitting past a small groove within the device. I was trying to be careful not to break it, but it can handle being pushed firmly so that it sits all the way on the bottom of the device. Once it is seated properly, the suction is great again :)         The only other thing I have run across, is that with very thick mucus (that of a nasty cold) the tip tends to get a little clogged. Just run some hot water through it (I just turned my kitchen faucet on high to blast it out) and you can go right back to clearing stuffy little noses.
B00005C6OI|5|This is a great bottle!  Dr. Brown really got it right this time! <br /> <br />My baby has virtually no gas and is happy happy happy!  She has struggled with gas while other bottle sets.  The cleaning process can be a little tedious and long, but it's well worth it!  A little more time or a lot less gas... you decide! <br /> <br />Nothing can compare! <br /> <br />Thank you Dr. Brown!
B008Y2DFLM|5|My son uses this pillow during supervised naps and when he is on his play gym. It's super soft and his head shape is already improved. It's a great pillow!
B005PWVIZE|5|This are very simple to install (more so than any other device we've used).  They do the job, but aren't quite as easy to open as some other devices.  So, they are probably more appropriate for cabinets and drawers that aren't accessed regularly, but ones that you'd still like to keep your infants/toddlers out of.
B001NGFSMK|5|The shape really does help to get all of the food out of the bowl.  It's great even when I'm holding the phone etc. in my other hand.      I read the inventor's story online and WOW!  WOW!  2 sets of twins and living with MS?  Not only do I love the bowl, I'm glad to support this amazing woman.
B00006966I|5|For me, the best bottles. My two kids used them for about 4 years. Never had gas or colics with them. Perfect!
B00PY2RJ0I|5|My baby won't sleep if not swaddled and at 4 am in the morning baby blanket origami just isn't that easy. I highly recommend it, buy two so you can wash one and still have a clean one to put baby in.
B00064MJDQ|5|my grandson just laughs constantly in his jumper - it's the highlight of his day.
B00MIRTH3E|1|These short cups do NOT fit the Baby Bullet - the thread on the top of the cup does not match the thread on the Baby Bullet blade top. DO NOT BUY if you want to use these cups with the Baby Bullet system. A total waste of money!!
B000N5KTCQ|1|I hate this stroller and am getting rid of it.  I intially bought it because of the peg perego reputation and it looked good.    CONS:  Big, bulky, HEAVY  Hard to open and close  Horrible instructions  Too complicated and time consuiming to change from stroller mode to carriage mode   Hard to reach basket when car seat is in  cup holder is a joke  No hood window so you can't see the child  doesn't go over curbs well    PROS:  Good construction  Smooth ride
B00318CLTQ|5|perfect cup. No leaking when closed. The open angle of the cover can be 180 degrees, the cover won't touch face when drinking.
B003VNKLHK|4|We have a small dog that can jump over any other fence.  It's amazing how high he can  jump .  This fence is easy to assemble and he now stays put in the area of the house we want him in.
B00FOL7RWY|1|How do I return this?  If is inexpensive but do not purchase this poorly engineered pack and playish item. The &#34;release button&#34; is microscopic. Ridiculous. Now onward to wasting my time returning junk.
B005BEG0N6|5|Our daughter has had awful reflux from the beginning. At 5 weeks she was put on Zantac because the upper GI test had really poor results. That took away the projectile vomiting, but she was still very &#34;spitty&#34; and uncomfortable. We used the necklace from 3-6 months and noticed a huge difference around the 3 week mark of her wearing it. She had it on her neck during the day and around her ankle under a sock in her jammies at night. If we forgot to put it on for a couple days her symptoms came right back. Her diaper rash also cleared up, and her poop, which was always green, turned into a normal color. Now she is 8 months and doing much better with the reflux and such, so she doesn't wear it anymore. It was a huge help when she was young, though!
B007A6TIFA|2|It arrived cracked :( the overall size seems slightly small and more appropriate for baby bums as opposed to toddler bums.
B00008439C|1|This what not what I expected it to be.  My son did not like it at all.  I had to sell it to someone else, but their son did like it....
B0014J0W8G|4|Have Large knob on cabinets.The last time bought, Sliding part was thinner. To wide to fit behind knobs. Guess can only use with handle type now!
B00003TL7P|1|We were former diaper genie fans until after about 8 mos of usage it was nearly impossible to change out the refill containers.  It seemed that the ring on the inside had worn down, and the refill wouldn't fit.  We became frustrated and went immediately to the store and purchased this diaper champ.  I so wished I had read the reviews on this product prior to my purchase.  I loved the fact that you could drop the diaper in the small opening and it immediately vanished to the inside of the pail.  However, the smells remained, causing our son's room to reek of waste.  No matter how many times we changed the bags, the smell never went away.  Nice concept, but a total waste of money.  We ended up going back and buying another diaper genie.  The one star I gave it is for the neat way you drop the diapers into the pail.
B00KDOELSA|5|I love this item.  It looks great on my wall and it was easy to put up
B006GH8CME|5|My mom order these for my son and I am so grateful!! They are fantastic!!! If you have a baby that has boogers you should own this item. I will get a pair for all the new moms I know.
B000067R64|4|We chose this seat because of the design (it's nice and simple, no cartoons and animals) and the fact that it was the only handle I could push the buttons in and could actually move!  The latch does get easier over time.  You don't even think about it after a while.  It is heavy, but being a first time mother I just figured they were all like that.  We now keep the car seat in the car and carry baby to and from.  We use a sling to carry through store.  As for the loud click in handle, we just push/pull it gently and slowly and it's not as bad.  It's easy to clip in/out of car and works great with the matching stroller!
B00DDT1GZ8|5|great price and quality
B00GF9B2Q6|3|I have received the Neoprene Necessities product line from Infantino to facilitate my review.<br /><br />I liked this product set. The changing mat is a standard size changing mat. It is of very nice quality and very easy to clean. It also lays flat nicely. I prefer this mat to the two others that I have.<br /><br />The actual bag I am not as crazy about. It is very small in my opinion. However, it is nice to throw inside my purse on small trips. That way I do not have to take the whole diaper bag.
B005XJ2VGE|5|This was a gift for my granddaughter little girl. The shipping was fast in good shape still can't figure how to put the foot rest in yet but we love this high chair
B00171WXII|5|this thing work GREAT!!! It's a MUST for babies. It's the only thing I have ever gotten to work in clearing up those little noses. By son is 28 months & I still use it. Easy to clean, too.
B006ZASO8E|3|Hello i love the monkey and the images but it wasnt to comfty the bumpers i tough it was going to be more fluffy was to skinny<br />The other parts are beautifull
B00UGITIIQ|5|This is a very useful product.  People who have kids know that there are all sorts of bath toys sitting around your tub.  This product gives you one convenient place to store them all and it's very easy to use.<br /><br />It works with suction cups that stick to the wall.  Usually, suction cups keep falling off the wall.  Not with this one.  I put this one up almost 3 weeks ago and it hasn't moved.  It's a great suction system.  And I have a TON of toys that I'm storing in there so my bag is pretty heavy.<br /><br />You basically attach it to the wall and fill it.  It keeps everything within reaching distance, yet nicely organized.  No more toys all over the tub!<br /><br />I can heartily recommend this product.<br /><br />I received a sample for review.
B0046C3SQQ|5|I never write reviews, but this playpen sheet is REALLY WELL MADE, VERY SOFT, SAFE AND PRECIOUS!!!!  It is well worth the money...much nicer than any sheet that I have seen before!!  I do not at all regret spending more to get a true QUALITY product!  It is also a SAFETY SHEET.  It slips over the entire playpen mattress, so that your baby can't get caught-up in it and strangle.  The material is high quality, bright and cheery!  (Looks like it will last a very long time.)  I also ordered the 3 inch deep &#34;Dream on me Playpen mattress&#34; & an &#34;American Baby fitted port-crib waterproof quilted mattress pad cover&#34; to go in my Fold 'n Go  Pack & Play playpen. Now it is much more comfortable for my baby to sleep in.  These RS Kids Inc. No slip play yard sheets fit nicely over both the mattress & pad.  Now my sweet baby can sleep safely & comfortably!
B00H8MSEXS|5|Great, Item is as described.
B00067AUNY|5|Was a present for my new great-nephew, and per his mother, he loves it!  Seems to calm and quiet him.
B00EU76CCY|3|Very beautiful only problem...decals coming off, not sticky enough
B0040GJ0UG|4|We bought this before a trip to Europe because of all the reviews that say it will keep your baby busy...I am sure it does the trick for some babies, but it did not work with mine. I actually did not use it because during a couple of months she did not play with it once. Kept pushing it on her, but nothing, she is just not into it. Hopefully one day otherwise I bought it for nothing. The product itself is well built, it has different things that spin on three sides, a mirror that also spins and some little cubes on one side to be moved on some curved wires. I think its a nice toy and I would reccommend it as every baby is different :).
B00E0HHQVK|5|Exactly as described and just what I was looking for!
B00MNMM6LY|5|I love these hangers!  Speedy delivery.
B0047PAHUW|5|We only use the pacifier at night or during nap time but without fail my son would lose it and flip out waking the whole house. Now the pacifier doesn't go far when it falls out of his mouth and he finds it everytime.
B000S8O9ME|1|Not worked at all
B000F78UAU|5|I've had this chair for almost 5 months now - since 1.5 months before my daughter was born. I'm giving this 5 stars because for the money, you just can't beat it! I really wanted a glider rocker, and I couldn't afford to spend $400 or more on one. The cushion isn't the best quality and the bottom is already starting to get thin, but the chair still works great.
B00B507D7C|4|I'd go with a 4 1/2 star rating.  The marks on the straps are great for making sure at a glance that nothing is twisted.  The seat is comfy, etc.  I wanted to comment on the one thing I hadn't seen mentioned... and that's the shoulder strap pads.  They are sewn in, which isn't necessarily an issue in my opinion... the problem is that when you tighten the straps, the pads pull up slightly into the slit in the seat.  This doesn't seem like an issue, but when it was warm and my daughter was wearing a tank top, her skin ended up getting pinched between the belt under the pad and the pad itself.  The belt was moving but the pad wasn't, so it just pulled a little bit there.  Not enough to draw blood or anything, but it definitely left a red mark and surprised her.  I'd rather have straps that aren't attached to the seat as I've never had a problem with the regular kind before.  I just make sure to watch closely when tightening her in now.
B000Q7PMNC|5|This makes a great security blanket!  The tags around the edges give babies something to tug on and the variety of colors and textures can help them explore.  Makes a great gift for expectant mothers or those with still young children.
B005MPAQAW|5|My baby (6 months) was just refusing to drop the swaddle. He does not sleep without it. We had other swaddles that worked fine (the kind that velcro) but he was outgrowing them. I was so glad to find this! This mega baby size still fits him with a bit more room to grow (7 months and a bit chunky). I love that he can wiggle around a bit more than in the velcro swaddles (I think it might help transition to no swaddle). He can work his little hands up to his chin or even his mouth inside the swaddle, but not so easily that he scratches himself or flails awake. And it fits great and I have no worries about it covering his face at any time. Plus, I'm loving the snap feature with the arms. We're going one arm out occasionally to start to wean him off.<br />I don't know what we would have done without it!
B000K50780|5|Shipping=Excellent<br />Product=Excellent
B00I90KGQ6|4|They are good. The only down side is having to buy hemp or bamboo inserts for them because my daughter can wet through the microfiber ones kind of fast.
B001LQLLNC|5|I bought one of these to hold my grandchild in an antique highchair. Evidently babies are slippery. This thing did the job and the baby stayed put every time.
B001TK8MY6|5|These cups worked perfectly for my granddaughter as a transition cup! They were low leakage and she actually now prefers them over bottles!
B0000645D7|3|It works like it says and is simple not to complex or insane set up.    remember to wash and let it dry out after every use...and those little parts too.    it does take more than 1 hr to pump just one side..but it depends on your milk supply too.
B00NN4I19M|5|I bought this for my grandson as his first pillow and he loves it.  He seems so sleep longer and wakes up more rested.
B00A6GIEJW|5|holds two of our soiled/wet AI1 cloth diapers
B000MVQBG4|3|We needed something beside a laundry basket to hold toys, and I didn't want to trust anything with suctions cups. This basket honestly, does not hold very many toys. I do like that I can move it to different areas in the tub. My LO does like to pick it up and dump all the toys out.
B009WPUMX4|5|I've been using Dr. Brown bottles for about 10 years now with 5 different children.  With my 5th I decided to get some glass ones to try out and I love these bottles even more!  So much sturdier and I have noticed these leak less then the plastic.  I've never had big issues with leaks anyways.  It would happen sometimes, no big deal.
B0054YZDWC|5|These are very handy, I use regularly with my 2 year old.  The cups and lids seal well and prevent minor drips and leaks for the most part and the straw is held in reasonably securely to the lid.  They are easy to clean, just tossing in dishwasher, and allow for that transition from bottle / sippy cup to normal cups with less risk of a mess.  Just a note that these can leak if they are dumped on their side, tossed etc... if you have a kid that enjoys being really rough on drinking containers these probably are not the best option, but they can be tipped over held on side for a few moments as any toddler may do without creating a complete mess.
B006SFUD2G|1|Did not warm milk in avent natural bottle. Buyers beware if your baby bottle is uneven in shape.
B00FK599DE|5|I had been using the size that came with my Medela In style pump for 5 months now. I just recently realized they may be too big for me when I started experiencing discomfort while and after pumping. I didn't want to spend a fortune in case I was wrong and the 24mm we're actually the proper size for me (because c'mon, how often have we had to size our nips lol).  They are perfect! I didn't realize how uncomfortable my other ones were until I got theses in the 21mm. I also like how the 'neck' of them is wider for cleaning and that they are one piece (other than the doodads at the bottom). Very happy with the price, simplicity, and quality.... and my nips are very happy with the proper fit! ;)
B002VX3RCW|5|It was just you would expect from Lamaze, they make great toys and the baby loved it which was the most important part!
B00014PL0E|3|This border is really cute, but difficult to put up. We tried using wallpaper glue like others have suggested, but it curled up on the edges and looked really tacky. We started over and used a staple gun and it looked fine. <br /> <br />If you are looking at the Sea Life nighlight, skip it. It is too large and heavy for the socket and leans over. It almost won't stay in the socket.
B00DNBA82S|1|This did not work at all for us. We could get the sound to work. If you yelled in the room, and had the monitor to your ear and the room you were in was quiet, you might be able to hear it. We were disappointed because we have another foscam wireless IP monitor that is pretty good - though come to think of it the sound doesn't work on that one either.  Anyway, we returned this one and got a different model completely.
B0041LYXDO|5|I thought it would be a little thicker material.  Bc it is for winter weather.
B005XJ2VGY|5|This chair has been really great for my son. We live in an apartment so this folds up to put to the side very easy. We can also fold it up and put it in the trunk when going to great grandma's house for the weekend. The wheels and compact design allow for wheeling him from one room to another as well so he can watch us make dinner and then come to the front room to eat at the table with us. As long as you wipe it down regularly, it is easy enough to keep clean, even in the crevices.
B006Z6D5X2|5|Works well with toddler and older kid/adult toothbrushes. Smaller than expected but fully functional!
B0083YMDX2|5|I absolutely love this set! It was perfect for my son's nursery. The fabric is great and the colors were exactly what I was expecting.
B00073HJG8|5|This is a very big hammock - the description says 6 feet. It may not be that big, but do try to put the stuff in, before you finalize the hanging. In our case, I didn't spread the 2 corners wide enough - it seems as I've expanded it well enough but as soon as I put in all the stuffed animal the hammock sinks.... Now it touches the couch which is annoying
B000FCW15U|5|I was looking for something to hang on the wall above the changing table when I found this.  From the first moment I layed my baby under it (at 8 weeks) he smiled and \\"talked\\" to the lion.  It was like it was a long lost friend.  It's the best reaction he's had to anything yet.  I could not be more thrilled with this!
B0049NYYQK|2|Really thin fabric so the pattern on the boppy shows through. :(
B002Y5XJCU|3|The product does what it should but I believe the picture is a little deceptive, as it's fairly short.  My daughter is small and if I strap this to the tray on her stroller, she can't reach it unless I have her propped up.
B001QVCH0S|5|Sooo soft! My sons love it! Its definitely for a smaller child or infant, its a bit small but its so cute and is still soft after washing.
B009SDGUGS|2|Too thin and too small.
B004QZBEBO|5|Love this brush set! The straw brush and the lid brush are perfect for cleaning breastpump parts and sippy cups.
B00272DB0U|4|Lighter than image but still cute though
B001TK32JG|5|We received this blanket in a neutral green for our daughter's baby shower. Three and a half years later it is still THE blanket. She has dragged this thing through almost every grocery store, zoo trip, car ride, park hop, and walk we've ever been on. It's still in fantastic condition. No holes; only minimal wear on the corner where she rubs at it. It is STILL soft as ever even after all of the abuse, washes, and dries.<br />If I had to make a complaint it would be that it takes forever for this blanket to dry. We usually have to put it through the dryer twice, or through the dryer once and then out to hang. I always wished I had a spare for those days when she really needed it and it was in the wash.
B00188XW26|1|We purchased this toy at a local store for our son who was only a few months old.  It was cute and he loved it.  It was one of the toys I put in his pack and play while I would shower, etc.  One day I came out and the plastic case had broken and the little balls were all over his pack and play.  He was only a few months old and this toy is rated for 0 months plus. DO NOT PURCHASE!! My son could have easily choked on the balls and I would never have known.  He was very little -- I was shocked when I saw this.
B007BEHSDU|5|Had to get a second pair. My son was very sensitive to noises at a young age, so we got him his first pair of these, and they were easy enough and comfortable and worked well enough that they have become his security blanket. If something is too loud or too scary, he can put these on and be pretty much invincible. Really works well for live music or being around loud vehicles.
B000F1OT3I|4|Awesome for your diaper bag. I didn't think I needed this item, as my diaper bag had spots for all of my diaper items. But..I learned that lugging my entire bag into the bathroom to change him was a pain. Not to mention fishing around for all of my separate diaper changing items. With this, everything is in once place. I only need to pull this out of my diaper bag and head off to change my little guy.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Several pockets<br />-Easy to manipulate zippers and buckle<br />-Zip-off changing mat<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Little padding in the changing pad<br />-Wipes holder doesn't keep wipes dry and it difficult to work with 1 hand. (I actually use a different wipes holder in this bag)
B00D1HC4LW|5|Squishy turtle rocks. Our daughter was obsessed for awhile, and it still provides regular save-the-day distraction from time to time.
B007JYZW08|5|Exactly what I ordered and perfect for what I use it for. I've even caught my husband using it to watch TV when I am not home.
B001FYT722|5|We bought the Peapod Plus through Amazon in 2008 and it's been great. We purchased the bed for our daughter who was then 28 months for an overseas trip. She had reached the point where she could climb out of a pack-and-play, so we needed something different. Our daughter loves her tent bed and it helps give her a familiar surrounding when she's in an unfamiliar house or hotel room.    We made sure that we ordered the bed a few weeks before we traveled and we initially set up the bed on our daughter's bedroom floor. We gave her the option of sleeping in her bed or in the tent at nap time and night time. She chose to sleep in the tent for a few nap times and one night time before we traveled. We were careful to make sure that the tend bed was a positive experience for her before we first traveled with it. Then when we did travel, she was excited to see her tent bed with its sleeping bag come out of the suitcase. When we travel we set up the tent with our daughters pillow, one of two of her stuffed toy friends, an extra blanket, and her flashlight.    The Peapod Plus has been durable for us, and it has survived spilled milk, flooded diapers, and a sleepless night of throwing up in a hotel room. Despite all that, it's not torn and it's not stained.    Setting it up is a breeze. Folding it up does take some practice, and you may even need to read the relatively simple instructions ... but please don't tell anyone that I actually had to read the instructions! When folded up, it's not tiny, but it fits OK in our larger suitcases and is relatively light.    Having been used locally, interstate, and overseas ... at home, at both grandparents' homes, and in hotel rooms, I only have good things to say about the PeaPod Plus Travel Bed.
B0054HSVGE|5|Very firm,  water proof,  and durable.  I have bought a total if theee if this mattresses obe gor each of my kids and they all seem to love it. Only problem I encounter was tearing on one of them, but then again I've had that particular mattress for over 3 years.  So I would categorize it under normal wear and tear.
B0042D69UQ|5|bellisimo y util
B00CPV2582|5|Hot it on timeand it was exactly what I or
B005IWM7WE|5|Nice little chair  Does the job!
B00BU8APWO|5|I purchased a Tady Tote for my niece and she (and baby!) just love it! I recently saw them at the park and they had the baby happily playing on it. It's large enough when spread out for the baby to roll around but folds up so easily for use as a tote. My niece has 4 children and said that this gift has been the best thing she's received for any of her children. It's durable and very easy to clean. This makes a great baby shower gift..highly recommended.
B004CLZH9W|1|Monitor worked great for the first 30 days or so until it just STOPPED turning on!  After contacting the manufacturer directly to see if this was a consistent problem the product they told me \\"Yes, this is a poorly made product that usually always breaks.\\"  Needless to say I did NOT want a replacement just my money back.  Shame on Levana for selling a product that they know is so poorly made!
B00NWBZP68|4|We put this around his ankle and it really does help with the drooling.  We were dealing with some constipation and I wondered if it was related but was never able to figure it out.  This is authentic, screws on easily, and has a nice deep dark color.
B004K4Q9BG|5|My daughter had it and used it every day til it died. Through 2 kids, very well made and does the job.
B004071ZR6|5|Kid is only 3 weeks old, and I'm trying to get him started on his golf career now.  I hope by wearing the clothes now he'll have a head start on what to wear when he gets out on the course in a couple months.  I mean, 6 months is as old as they have to be before they can start their training, right?<br /><br />Well made, hasn't fallen apart, and it's kids clothes.  Matches the description and priced ok, so no complaints at all.
B00GXVDM1Y|1|This pump did not work and killed me.
B0009RNXNA|4|I love this bag--great quality, easy to carry around, HUGE, and definitely fits my Britax Roundabout 50 with room to spare.  However, when I arrived at my destination, I found a hole ripped through my brand new bag.  Luckily, the seat was not damaged.  What I learned is that you cannot allow for open space between the bag and interior of the seat itself.  On my return trip, I filled the area with a bag of dirty clothes and had no problems.  The airlines must have placed a large item on top of the spot that had no support underneath which resulted in the tear.  I would have given this items 5 stars if it weren't for this issue. My advice--fill the extra space to avoid any problems.
B0047O2C3S|5|Soft and refreshingly different from store bought versions of a wash cloth.... especially the R Us versions of it...Recommended purchase for the naive mother and father to be.
B004WPKWNO|5|This is a wonderful set! Easy to apply and reposition if needed! Worked well on our wall. The animals are so cute and the letters are just the right size! Our nursery turned out super cute with little effort. A winner!
B0012QQQ7C|3|And you could probably do a better job yourself.. The messages are cute, and I love the idea, however.. A better be interested and paper would have made a huge difference. . I ended up copying the sayings,  buying mints and printing them out myself.. looked much nicer
B007MJSHTI|5|The quality is nice for the price and we love the little designs of ladybugs, leaves, etc. Highly recommend for a little girls nursery. Our crib is the Daydreamer and it's a bit smaller than most cribs. We like the Bumper set because the ties allowed us to tuck to make it fit.
B004OR1DZG|5|This was perfect for storing all the pens, pencils, markers, etc for our kids room! The design is very cool!
B0010SGZEG|3|The product description says '9 years and up'.  This is listed in the baby bath toys section.  BE CAREFUL in purchasing these products that are mislabeled or miscategorized.  Look for phthalate-free toys for babies that chew/teethe on everything.
B0037NXAIQ|5|This diaper cover is great.  It holds prefold and fitted diapers well.  It is easy to fit with all the buttons but can be a little challenging for grandma.  I like it better than the imse diaper covers I have (hand me downs) as they are not quite waterproof.  The price is a bit higher than I would like to spend but since it's a one size diaper cover, it should last till the end.  My son was 8lbs 6oz at birth and is currently 13lbs.  He's getting chubby and the cover has fit him well in both his skinny and bulky stages.  I would highly recommend.
B0007V644S|5|this is better than the similar product I bought from BabysRus.  design is the same but it controls odor better.  I recommend this very highly!
B0067HLO6O|5|Recommend this item buy all coordinates because are very nice, and combine wonderful for the room of girls.  Buy this item and I happy with this.
B0050GD2AO|4|I'm a new mom and really like this stroller, it turns on a dime and folds up very easily. Takes a little to get used to opening it but it works well and is solidly built. I have the adapter and use a Chico key fit car seat. It also works pretty good!
B000EGZ40G|5|This item is GREAT. It came just as described and has made storing my milk SO much easier. I agree with the other review that milk storage bags are messy and take up so much space in your freezer. I was also blessed with very active milk glands and at 6.99 for 25 bags..I was spending upwards of 30 dollars a month on the bags! This bottle storage system takes care of everything and you can use the bottles on my breast pump and the nipples from my bottles fit on them too! SO convienient! BUY THIS PRODUCT! I wish I could tell all mom's about this BEFORE they buy the bags and spend the money on them. This product pays for itself in a the first month! AND you can also buy extra bottles if you need them! A+++++
B006ZSYKDO|5|Love how soft these sheets are. Only complaint is that they snag easily. Definitely be careful washing with anything with Velcro or even using the Velcro swaddle blankets.
B007NG5UF4|4|Great way to keep tabs on my granddaughter when she's napping in the other room.
B006YBHE6M|5|The baby LOVES this. She goes to sleep so much easier when this is on. Love the fact that there is a button for her to turn on and off.
B003ZUXNRO|5|I am very satisfied with this product. It's so soft and really does the job! I will be purchasing another set of these for our next baby due in March. They are so much better than the covers that come with the car seat. Must have item!!
B006V84MWM|2|it's very hard to suck the water from the straw, even for adults.  My 2 year old simply can't drink from it, and from what I see there is no way to adjust it.
B002UJGK1C|5|Love these thermoses!
B001T9EWLY|5|This is the first ring sling I have owned. I am still getting used to it. I have found the higher I carry my 13 pound daughter in the side carry the better I feel.  The pocket is big enough to hold a cell phone, a jar of food, bibs, wash cloths, and a few spoons.  It could easily hold a few diapers.  At 5 foot tall the medium has the pocket near my knee.  You don't want to get this light green color if you will be doing any work in front of a green screen.
B002OOTYPC|5|Good Quality, my 15 mo old is trying and my 3 yr old loves the graphics, he also likes the case, washing well.  The spoon could be deeper but mostly i got this for the fork, its just right, not too sharp but stabs food- perfect for a toddler.
B0042D69XS|5|This is a very nuce product. It vibrates, has bird sounds and plays soft music with volume control.  The fabric is soft and comforting for your little one.
B00A47J6XG|5|We take this everywhere with us. It is very lightweight and easy to fold up and assemble. Instead of using booster seats in restaurants, we use this instead and I know it's clean.<br /><br />We also go camping a lot and this chair makes it so easy to bring the baby with us.
B000WJPCFW|4|there are good and fun charaters on it, and it is safer than other items.  BTW, it was little high for 7 month babies when it was fully down.
B004IU40IG|5|My granddaughter LOVES these pacifiers and they are so cute!  In fact I bought my youngest daughter two of these as a gift at her baby shower and it was a hit!
B00006IZQY|3|I bought the wipe warmer thinking it would be better than the original warmer but it's not. Within 4 days the lid broke.  It does keeps the wipe nice and warm though.  It's just a pain in the neck to keep picking up the lid off the floor when you have more important things(baby)to worry about. For the price, I would've thought it would stay in one piece.
B004GIFIMW|5|Perfectly perfect!!! I love them!
B000067K0L|5|I bought this mat as my first real baby purchase on one of my first days out of the house after my son was born.  I was quite sleepy when I bought it did not really know which activity mat to buy but I chose this one and so far it is great!  I had no idea how much we would both end up enjoying it.   <br /> <br />I initially just put him down on the mat next to my dining room table to see if it would quiet him while I ate breakfast but both my husband and I got drawn in to his reaction to it and now I spend every morning eating my breakfast on the floor next to the baby while he discovers new things and coos.  We have used it for just over a week and he has already discovered how to grasp the mirror to move it around, how to kick the bird toy to make a sound (the wings crinkle) and how to reach for and try to grasp the monkey's feet. <br /> <br />After we showed him that he could touch the different animal toys he started to bat at them on his own and now tries to grasp them.  He is now just over 6 weeks old (but was more than 4 weeks premature) and I am amazed at how this toy seems to be helping his coordination.  I have used this mat interactively with him by playing with objects myself and then moving his hands to the objects and then seeing if he will repeat the action.  So far, each day he has learned that he can do something new or improve on something he did the day before, which is exciting for both of us.
B00CHZ7LI0|5|Grandkids love this tub.
B003X3R6TO|5|I bought these because I was considering switching to cloth wipes.  My husband was against the idea.  The normal disposable wipes I buy happened to be sold out.  The ones I ended up buying my daughter was allergic to.  These are working out great no rashes.  One wipe is all I need for a diaper change.  I wet one with warm tap water.  Rinse it out well and wash with my diapers everything comes out nice and clean. I'm gonna buy another set of these.  Update:  In total I have bought 5 packs of these wipes.  We have both decided these are really great wipes.  My kids have started using them instead of toilet paper.  Say they don't hurt their bottoms.  I keep a bucket with soapy water next to the toilet to put the dirty ones in.  Makes it easier to clean them.  I wash along with my cloth diapers.  I hang dry them only.
B006ZSYHCI|3|I bought two of these sleep sacks for my 4 month old after having friends who loved them. I like the softness of the muslin and thought they'd be perfect.  However, I think they're too thin and don't really do anything to keep baby warmer than his footed pj's already do. We have central A/C and ceiling fans and I've ended up putting a blanket over the baby on some nights. The 4 layer muslin ones would possily be a better choice.  Also, the zipper isn't very high quality, it's come \\"off track\\" a couple times and I've had to fight to fix it while it's on the baby.  I'm glad I didn't pay the full retail price for these.
B001I481LM|5|I love this mixer! I can mix all of my baby's bottles for the whole day and I know the formula will be completely mixed. I ordered this because when I fixed bottles myself sometimes the formula wouldn't mix all the way and leave clumps. Not anymore.. It only takes a few minutes and I have all his bottles completely mixed. Very glad I decided to purchase this!
B003VNKLHA|1|We have a split level home and ordered two of these gates. We specifically bought this kind because we needed one that was extra wide for our stairs. We got it, my husband installed it, and then we realized that the although the whole gate itself fits our 4' stairway 48&#34;, the walk-thru part is only 16&#34;. We are not large people but this is ridiculous to try to get through. It's an even bigger pain when I try to carry in groceries or when I have my baby in her carrier and have to lift her up over the gate when I get to the top of the stairs. The gate is not incredibly sturdy...sturdy enough that it will keep my baby from going down the stairs but it's very wobbly and it isn't because of the install, I guess it's too wide and without having any support along the bottom it's just kind of wobbly. I would have returned these gates if I wasn't in such an immediate need for them. I would not at all recommend anyone buying this product.
B00B7XUVM6|3|The bag is beautiful and exactly what my granddaughter wanted, but after trying to put 'baby needs' into the bag,,, it definitely could stand to be bigger. Will still be used though.
B0010TODHG|4|Purchased this crib in espresso few weeks back.It is beautiful when put together and very very sturdy. The quality of wood is very good. Overall a safe  and beautiful place for your baby.<br /><br />BUT the piece that we got had 2 SCRATCHES . One was down below and the other one was on the upper visible side. Unfortunately we noticed it only after putting the crib together and did not replace it. So if you are getting this, be sure to check the wood pieces for any damage before putting it together, so that you can get a replacement. i did get a 20% from amazon for the defect.<br /><br />Assembling: Assembling took couple of hour. Instructions were OK but the wood pieces doesnt have any numbering on it to follow and that makes it challenging. Would request for sticking numbers on the wood and match it in the instruction manual to make our life easy.
B002U73L48|5|Easy for baby to hold on to. Fits perfect in their little mouth. Used these for my first child. Love them.
B004LYARXQ|1|I returned this Winnie the Pooh. It was way too small & dinky looking. Not what I expected at all!
B006SFUCT0|3|Two drawbacks of this product, one is it counts time not temperature, if you warm up a 4oz bottle got out from freezer and next time a food jar at room temperature, they will require quite different time and you need to rely on yourself to make it right. The other is so weird, you have to turn that spin button to more than 2 mins otherwise it won't stop working and dry the water and burn the bottles. I am still using it for I am now quite experienced with time estimation and making sure everytime I make it work more than 2 mins even though it is not needed. But if you haven't chosen one, I suggest you to purchase a better designed one.
B006PB2B6O|4|I bought this for occasional use as a second car seat.  Our primary seat that gets daily use is a Graco Nautilus which is more durable, but also much heavier and difficult/cumbersome to move around from car to car.  This Evenflo seat is very lightweight and easy to install and secure.  My in-laws have used it in their car as well and had no difficulty moving it and securing in their vehicle.  The seat itself is nice and roomy.  It is at a slight recline, whereas the Graco is compeltely upright. I  am considering using the Evenflo for an upcoming long car trip because it seems like it will be more comfortable for my two year old to sleep in.<br /><br />The seat seems comfortable for her, she like to ride in it.  The straps are easy to adjust.  I am not currently using the cup holder but it doesn't seem like it would hold up for very long with a toddler :)<br /><br />When I purchased this car seat, it was available at a price if $47.99 with free shipping which I thought was an excellent value.  I really like the seat and would recommend it as a very service-able second car seat.  It may hold up for more regular use, but I can't attest to that.  For our purposes, it was a very good purchase.
B001WAJVZM|5|Great product. Easy to put on and it does the job, looks cute too. Would recommend this product to others.
B00IK1UDDU|5|This book is so cute! My son's nursery is a woodland animals theme and I used this book to hold ultrasound photos. The only thing I'm confused about is mine came as a set of 3. So I got 3 for the price of 1!! I don't know if I'm looking over it but I didn't see where it says it comes with 3 books...
B0000649E5|5|I don't use these for diapers, but I do use them for EVERYTHING else!  My son has one at his side all day long!!  He loves to snuggle into it!!  Helps his fall asleep, they are soooo soft & cuddly, I want to sleep with them too!!  They wash well also, they don't shrink, and I wash them 2-3 x's a week!  Great for mopping up spills, spit up, drool.  Wonderful product, highly recommended!
B00005C6OI|5|My first daughter had terrible colic we went though 4 months of no sleep I tried everything but nothing worked. When my second daughter was born and also had colic I thought I was cursed. I went through a month of fussiness until I saw Dr. Brown's bottles at Babies R Us. I tried a 4 oz pack. She was 85% better the first night. Needless to say I went back and bought 3 more packs. And I am here today to buy more 8 oz bottles. They are great! As both a nurse and mother I highly recommend them.
B00BFEUM3A|3|I had the mesh bags and my kids never liked them.  So I decided to try this and was hopeful that this would work better.  It seems big for a tiny mouth and quite stiff and hard to chew on.  My kids never really like this one either.  Maybe its just my kids but they seem to just go from baby food to small solids quite easily.  Bummer I was hoping they would like it better then the mesh bags.
B00IBO5O6W|1|This mat is slippery and the colored dots are slightly raised and hard as a rock!  My daughter slides all over the tub and has bruises on her knees from the colored dots.
B006ZVV0P2|5|I am very satisfied with these mats as they are what was advertised.  I would recommend to anyone to purchase this product.
B0049ZOEA4|5|My daughter absolutely loves this teething fish! out of all her teething toys she plays with this the most. its easy to hold and very simple to clean!
B009ERZDJ8|5|Great product!
B003G2YUUA|5|First of all I purchased this item because it had the projector and the mirror (my son loves to look at his reflection). The music is nice, there are two volume levels to choose from and you can switch from classical to nursery rhymes or animals sounds. The projector is more than what I expected, very bright and the colorful and enough to hold my 5 month old sons attention because it switches back and forth between two scenes. Also if you take the projector out of the slot and prop it at an angle towards a bare wall it expands (of course) and the wall becomes a source of entertainment for the little one. Overall I feel that this was a great purchase and I would definitely recommend it!
B000BNQC58|4|perfect as a gift to any child. turtle is very soft but the shell is hard so be carefully leaving it in cribs or beds over night.
B00029TCR6|3|Not so easy to put together.  Lots of knobs didnt fit accurately for handles.
B00U46546K|5|Great quality, its perfect.
B003KN27EG|5|I don't know how we would have survived a MI winter without it! I bought it so that my three year old daughter would be warm on the stroller ride to drop off brother to school (round trip about 20 mins or more outside).  She's as tall as some four year olds and this fits comfortably.  It's possible to zip up to her neck but she prefers it to sit at her waist.  It's super warm and cozy and we typically just pop her in with only socks on.  I still have her wear her coat and hat.  So we have the Orbit system toddler seat and with her coat on and even a bit without the straps are not long enough.  But the whole thing stays in place without even being attached to the straps.
B00IP8A9S2|1|I truly hate this car seat.  It was impossible to get a safe (tight) install with the latch rear-facing and the seatbelt install wasn't much better.  I bought this for my mother's car, because it was an inexpensive seat with side impact protection and a steel frame.  I guess you get what you pay for.  My mom refuses to use it, not just because the install keep loosening, but because the mechanism for loosening the harness is so difficult to operate that she is afraid she won't be able to do it by herself and my little girl will be trapped in the seat.  Will be purchasing her a Diono seat, which is exactly what I should have done in the first place.  Very disappointed.
B00849L4MW|3|This is a large bag, too large for everyday use.  The interior is black, which I hate, because it is hard to see and find things.  The overall construction is not very sturdy.  It appears that if you stuff the bag to full capacity as a diaper bag, the bag may break soon.<br />The bag has 2 very large exterior bottle pockets, each can probably hold 2 water bottles.  One large zippered compartment with 3 pockets inside and one large slip pocket right at the front.  Interior:  2 mesh pockets, 2 side bottle pockets, 2 slip pockets, and 1 zippered pocket.  Great that this bag has many pockets inside and out.<br />But...please manufacturer... no black linings inside a diaper bag.  Eyes get very tired searching for things.  Also, the exterior front slip pocket should be zippered, with slip pockets inside for cell phone, etc.  Moms don't want to open the large main compartment just to access cell phone which could happen several times in an hour.<br />To me, this bag could be a good bag for picnic.
B00009VE5O|4|I was very pleased with this product. However, the material inside does tend to &#34;pill up&#34; and comes off very easily. There's many concerns from other customers about the same issue.
B0006H5WJ6|5|My Husband and I are having our first \\"DAUGHTER\\" and hated the idea of getting frilly pinks and princess stuff for her room. We wanted to do a more earth tone colors and show her that just because she's a girl doesnt meant she has to always have to have pink. The fabric is FANTASTIC!!! The different textures on the blankets are a great asset and all the matching accessories are fun and very eye catching. The quality is great.. yes a touch pricy, but it will last a long time.. remember, you get what you pay for...  We get loads of comments and it goes well with our dark mahogany crib...
B00ZSRJHKY|1|There is no listing of quantity.  That is why I can't buy this.
B004K6LMSO|5|Love these storage containers.  Just ordered a second set.  They are the perfect thing for storing homemade baby food!
B005LXO9TE|1|purchased as a perhaps helpful tool for security of disabled senior living alone.  very disappointed it beeps no reason at times and the one-way communication makes it's use very limited.  Not pleased at all with the product, below my expectations.
B00M2F0OYS|1|After our first child was born we got the Motorola MBP36 and absolutely loved it!  The only problem we ever had was that the power cords frayed at the end of the parent unit (electrical tape fixed this).  We loved the product so much that we recommended it to lots of our friends.  When we had our second child a couple of months ago, we decided to upgrade to the 36S so that we could view the two kids in the &#34;split screen&#34; mode.  I wish we'd never spent the money.<br /><br />The first monitor we bought, we purchased at a local chain baby store because it was an exclusive item that came with the parent unit and two cameras.  It was quite a savings to buy the set, rather than buy the parent unit with one camera and add an additional camera separately.  We began having problems with it as soon as we took it out of the package.  When switching back and forth from one camera to the other, the picture would get pixlelated and distorted and we would have to switch back and forth a few times for it to become clear again.  At first it wasn't a huge deal, but eventually the picture became so bad, that I took it back to the store and exchanged it for a whole new set.<br /><br />After we got the replacement, things seemed to work great....for a few weeks.  Our favorite part of the monitor was the &#34;picture in picture&#34; feature (one camera view on the large screen and the other camera view in a smaller box in the corner) that is advertised by Motorola.  Although we could only hear sound on the camera that was in the large view, it was very easy to manually switch back and forth between cameras.  We didn't love the &#34;scan&#34; view, where it switched back and forth between cameras every 12 seconds, so we used the &#34;picture in picture&#34; view constantly.  One evening after putting our kids to bed, I grabbed the monitor to make sure they were settling in and the &#34;picture in picture&#34; view was gone.  Instead, we saw the two camera views in two TINY boxes at the top of a screen split into 4 boxes (the bottom two boxes, intended for additional cameras, were black).  I was perplexed...I thought maybe I had hit a button or our 3 year old had accidentally changed a setting but nothing I tried fixed the problem, so I called the company.  We were on the phone with customer service for about 40 minutes and the representative we spoke with put us on hold about 10 times (was he googling the problem, we wondered?! :))  Finally he told us that the &#34;picture in picture&#34; was a factory setting that got changed into the grid view due to some sort of a software upgrade and there was no way to change it back!!  This makes NO sense at all!  He said that there was nothing else he could do and that if we were not satisfied with the monitor we could take it back to the store.<br /><br />Needless to say, we did take it back.  Highly dissatisfied!
B000JVXZF2|4|We watch our 13 month old grandson a few nights a week. For the money it was perfect. Cleans up easy.
B00I3ZI2W2|1|They have recently updated (downgraded) these zippy cups.  We used to only buy these cups, but with the update they have a very cheap clear plastic that breaks very easily.  We bought this 4 pack in the middle of february and all 4 of the cups have broken.  This is not even two months later.  Very poor quality, and unable to find the old version.
B000H1IYXW|5|We bought this for the side of my child's bunk bed sense the bed is from my husband's child hood it did not have side rails.  This worked great, little challenge to put together but other wise I love them!!
B003MHUAKS|5|THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE CRIB SET IS JUST WHAT WE WANTED FOR MY COUSINS SHOWER. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL SET.
B00162ZLVE|1|Not happy because I ordered wiht the strap kiwi and was not included<br />Only came wiht the withe boll is not the same as the picture
B00D7IEF26|4|After reading a few reviews Stating that this blanket is complicated to use, I was compelled to write my own review to dispute that. It's simple, and just in case you can't figure it out on your own, it comes with very simple directions. (This is coming from someone who usually can't even process directions!)<br />Also, my 3-month-old has never kicked out of the leg pocket, despite others mentioning that it is easy for their babies to do so.<br />We received this blanket as a gift, and while I probably wouldn't have shelled out the big bucks to buy it myself, I'm glad we have it. My baby can easily break out of my tightest swaddle in her aden + anais blankets, but she has never escaped from the miracle blanket. I gave it four stars only because for us there is no \\"miracle.\\" Ever since we saw ultrasound photos while I was still pregnant we've known that our baby prefers to sleep with her arms up by her head, and when she is swaddled she sometimes struggles against the fabric trying to break free. It makes me feel guilty! The past couple of nights we've left her arms out, and it hasn't seemed to affect her sleep.<br />However, if you have a baby who needs to be swaddled in order to sleep well, who breaks out of traditional swaddles, I'd recommend the miracle blanket to you. I'd also recommend it as a great shower gift!
B007PQOVNE|5|After searching high and low for a line of truly safe and organic baby shampoo/wash, I was happy to come across this brand. Most other brands that claim to be organic and natural still have some ingredients that I don't want to expose my baby to (especially synthetic fragrances/pthalates, endocrine disruptors, etc)I also love the well balanced of the lavender scent not to much making my baby smell like lavender oil and not to little leaving a slight refreshing lavender scent. I can't wait to try the sweet orange scent and plan to use this line for both my baby and myself!
B000RHJT6C|5|These bags are great, we bring our dispenser and bags everywhere with us. It is GREAT to have when you are at a friend's house changing a stinky diaper...you aren't just throwing a stinky mess in their trash. It helps to have the scented bag to mask the smell a bit. We have even used the bags for dog walking, definitely got our money's worth!<br /><br />They are a bit more pricey than I would like to see, but in my mind, they are worth it!
B004J4VXWM|1|They leak and the lids pop off.  I called Ziploc to complain about their product and the told me they are not responsible since it is not one of their products.  What!?!?  So they don't even stand behind their name on the product.  Don't bother with these cup.
B000JQ0BAY|5|Love it!
B00HT6EA2C|4|A little cumbersome to turn, but much better than a double stroller. Works great for us.
B001D4951C|1|I have received the sleepsack, but it does not get the swaddle. Does the swaddle sent seperately ? I really need the swaddle.
B00003ZACP|4|Rather than purchasing a changing table my husband and I got a new low dresser and use this changing pad on top of the dresser.  We screwed the webbing straps into the back of the dresser (a must for safety!).  It has served us well and is a nice thick cushion.  However, because we screwed the webbing straps into the back of our dresser the removable, washable cover is no longer easy to remove for washing!  We get around this minor difficulty by placing a waterproof liner on top, and a towel on top of that.  Now we simply whisk the towel into the diaper pail and wash it along with the dirty diapers.  It has served us very well.
B000MBZJ62|5|:)
B004RJZ0KU|5|These really are one size fits all! I can't believe the difference compared to my other OS diapers. and I LOVE the Coolmax, it is so soft!
B00P0A6OM8|5|These work great! We had the kind you pull down and the suction cups kept coming off. With these, the sun glare is diminished and they can still see out the windows.
B0043IS18I|1|after much finagling and fiddling I got item to work, but after that one time it never worked again. my husband (an electrician) believes the on/off switch is not working correctly and yes, we tried changing batteries several times. I only spent $8.00, so it wasn't worth paying shipping to return and receive another one of same quality. also, I didn't expect it to work wonders. however, if your looking for something that has tremendous blowing power this item is not for you.
B00318CO6G|5|Loved it so much had to by a second one.  Really durable and easy to clean, just pop it apart and put it in the dishwasher.
B000067QMJ|1|I have a boy, and like many of the others who have wrote a review, I am very disappointed in this product.  While I'm thrilled when my son tells me he has to go potty, I'm tired of cleaning up the floor after every trip to the \\"royal throne\\".  This product was very poorly designed.  Boys somehow shoot through where the top of the pan meets the bottom of the chair.  There is no way Fisher Price did any \\"trials\\" on this product before putting it on the market.  And as for the music, the batteries quickly ran out because the thing was playing music all the time, even if no one was in the room.
B002U41OI6|5|I have had these car seat now for a couple weeks with my 8-month-old and have been nothing but pleased with it. Since my baby seems comfortable and happy in it, I feel like it's more important in this review for me to address issues that other people seem to have had with this car seat that caused them to give it a negative review. I will say that the fabric has caused my normally sweaty son to not get so overheated, and the cover removes easily for cleaning. I also love that the shoulder straps are tied in to the adjustable back/side air pocket supports so that as baby grows you won't have to repeatedly disassemble the whole strap mechanism just to adjust the height.    Some people have said that when rear-facing the seat causes their child to sit \\"too upright.\\" This will only be the case if you have installed the seat incorrectly. I confess I almost made that mistake myself, so I can see where other people have done it. There is a level line on the side which should be parallel to the ground, and if it's in correctly the seat will be very reclined and comfy for baby. Yes, you will need to put a rolled towel under it to get it lined up correctly. From what I understand this is pretty common with convertible seats.    IF YOUR BABY IS TOO UPRIGHT IN THIS CAR SEAT, YOU HAVE NOT INSTALLED IT CORRECTLY! THIS IS YOU ENDANGERING YOUR CHILD, NOT THE CAR SEAT!!    In terms of size and fitting into the vehicle, I have mine installed behind the passenger seat of a 2004 Subaru Forester (so it's much smaller than a new Forester). The front seat is now pretty close up, but not all the way forward. This isn't a problem for us because my husband and I are both pretty small people - it's actually pretty close to where I have to have the driver's seat anyway! However in addition to the safety features we chose this seat in part because if you see it in the store next to a lot of the other convertibles out there it is clearly narrower and we are hoping to add another car seat to theback in the next year or so. :) If you have a compact car there could be a problem with size, but my Forester isn't much bigger than a regular sedan. Our other car is a Mini Cooper - I will update my review after I try installing it in that!!    As to installation, the first installation took me a while because I was still getting familiar with it and reading the directions. Probably about 20 minutes. Some tips: When rear-facing, you will probably need a rolled up towel or two so be prepared when you first head out to install it. The instructions may tell you to remove the cover from the bottom, but then you can't put it back on once it's firmly installed. I found it best to push aside the cover from the right side where the latch strap is tightened from. The instructions tell you to pull the strap through the access hole, and this is a good idea. The second time I installed it took about 2 minutes. I also want to note here that regardless of what the directions say, an average mom simply pushing down on the seat \\"firmly\\" with your hand does not exert enough pressure to securely install the seat. The best thing to do is kneel on it with as much of your body weight as you can (making sure not to compress the strap) while tightening the straps down.     I also noticed some comments about the ease of using the buckles and harness straps. I have had absolutely no problems with this at all. The buckles I found to be easier than on my Chicco infant seat, actually. And although clearly my son isn't old enough yet to have enough dexterity to open the chest strap buckle it looks like the design is such that he won't be able to open it himself for a long time. I also found the straps to be softer than on other car seats which is kind of nice so I don't feel like they are cutting into his chubby little legs. The access point for the strap release is a tiny bit difficult to push because the hole in the cover could probably stand to be a little bit bigger.    Overall we are verypleased with this car seat, and my mother is probably going to get one for her car.
B00012FGA6|5|I've been talking abotu buying these for years. I don't know why I just never did. But finally I have them and finally instead of falling between my kids' beds and the wall, all their stuffed animals are safely tucked up high. It makes for great organization, being able to actually see what you have and it's cleaner. I'm tempted to buy a bunch and just start throwing all kinds of things in them! It's always good to take advantage of vertical space! Go ahead and try them, I wish I did sooner.
B000ROOA32|2|We bought this soothie attahcer for our 2 month old thinking it would be a great purchase because she was used to the soothie pacifier, being a preemie she had the use of one in the hospital for over a month. It turns out that this attacher is quite bulky and heavy and she did not want to keep the pacifier in her mouth. She would cry because she wanted the pacifier, but it was too heavy to hold in her mouth, and we ended up taking the pacifier out of the holder, which defeated the purpose. This may work for older babies, but I would not recommend for newborns or preemies.
B00LWRI3MC|3|Cute and good quality but it does not stand like in the picture, too soft to stand. As well not enough to hold 2 meals. I returned it
B00HZDP532|5|So perfect
B005SZP22S|1|Very small. Had trouble obtaining the return label
B00AZNE7A6|5|Good starting set for babies/toddlers.  Big handle for them to hold.
B00545Q8IY|4|Very nice bag plenty of space will be great when I travel.  I just wish some of the zipper pockets were a little deeper but other than that it's a great bag. I would buy it again. Also, the bag is BROWN, pink & tangerine.  Looking at the picture I thought it was an olive green color.  I'm not disappointed or anything just an observation.
B00IAOVRM8|5|I love having this in my diaper bag when we visit the doctors are for short trips to the doctors office.
B008J478JK|2|I wish I had read the reviews before buying this product. I liked the larger sized bin - it holds a lot of ice, but getting the ice out of the rubber tray is impossible. Even running warm water on the back does nothing to budge the cubes until they melt and become a wet mess. Don't buy it, it's a waste of money!
B001ZVR38K|5|Great material for teething babies to chew on. I would recommended this product to go with your ergo carrier for sure.
B0000DEWH8|5|Only sorry our grandbabies out grew it already
B00JY6R1GC|4|The material is very hard, bent drooping ears, differences with the photos.
B0036VDNBS|5|These cups are so darn cute.  My 19 month old says, &#34;Miwk!  Cup!  Skulls!  Wittle One.  Big one.  Skulls!&#34;  with glee!  Tops stay on so they don't spill.  Unless the babe turns them over, which she does about half the time, but oh well:)
B002SNAKCK|5|I don't have much to compare this to since I only have one kid, but we have really loved this stroller. We purchased it a few years ago for Jazzfest in New Orleans when we took our son for the first time. We selected it primarily for the larger wheels, the rain cover and the reclining seat.<br /><br />It still looks and works great. Easy to fold up and expand. The cover washes up in the machine on delicate perfectly. Glad we bought it.
B007G174LY|5|I purchased this online for my son's cherry wood crib. I was searching for a soft, effective bumper that didn't have an overly busy, obnoxious print. When this bumper came in the mail, I was pleasantly surprised. The colors are as shown, slightly muted and relaxing. The print is subtle and my baby boy isn't going to wake up to big-eyed animals staring at him, which so many other bumpers seem to have. Also, the bumper is reversible, which is a nice option.
B00DNBA82S|5|Had it for a eight months and it is still in great working order.  This has been an excellent product thus far.
B000VY1WPC|3|I like this kind of toilet trainer because I am not a fan of cleaning the bowl out if you would when you use the little kid potty version of this. I only use it as a stepper seat to the regular size toilet. A little flimzy and a pain in the you know what to put together. At first you see these big plastic nuts and bolts which is cute if you want your kids to help, however, they give you this little blue tool that is indescribable. It looks like a four leaf clover with a Philiphs head on it. I have small hands and have a hard time holding this to get a good tight fit.
B00012CHFI|2|It's way too short! My son outgrew it by the time he was 3 weeks old, and he's average length. Also, he rolled to one side in it. Big waste of money!
B002LHP90G|2|These sheets are too thin and there is something about the material that I don't like.. I can't pinpoint but it is not like my other crib sheets.. It's very flimsy and when I try to fold it(I am very picky about folding my fitted sheets) this doesn't feel right.. The elastic hangs lose and off
B00OWFZMFW|5|I bought these boots locally on consignment for more than they are here. We've loved them so much! You can't go wrong with these boots and at this price I wish they were the next larger size.
B00DG0U5A6|5|The gate is exactly what I expected and exactly what I needed!  I have two fur babies and this gate works perfect! I have an add-on to my house that used to be a back porch and now is a sunken-in dining room with laminiate flooring that is a work in progress.  I keep the pups in there while I'm at work and they have plenty of room to roam around and the gate will keep them out of harms way - and trouble!
B004CL9YZU|4|I researched many gates before deciding on this one. We needed one that our smart toddler would not figure out. This one you can mount to the wall or use pressure. We have had it about a month. The little gray peice at the bottom, that can stop it from open which ever way you choose falls off alot. The door space is nice and roomy. I can open one handed and have no problem going through with a basket of laundry.
B004VL2VS8|4|All in all I've been very happy with this monitor. We used the command velcro hooks to attach it to the wall out of reach of my now 10 month old daughter.  My only issue with it is that the voice activation is sometimes faulty.  It either takes a while to kick on or it turns off too soon.  There have been a number of instances when I happened to look at the monitor to see my daughter playing in her crib even though the sound didn't kick on.  It makes me feel much more secure to be able to see her, but I wish the sound was better.
B00O4F2I2U|4|bought it for kids to watch grandkids. they really depend on it while getting chores done while babies are asleep. seems to have a long battery life and very durable ( the two year old likes to play with it). takes a little getting used to looking at the picture when the room is dark but otherwise they are very happy with it.
B004G8QSYO|5|These blocks are great! I let my daughter start handling them right around 3 months old. She LOVES the crinkly ones! She is 6 months now & they get plenty of use. She chews, throws,  and squeezes them. They hold up great, and I actually wash them in hot soapy water and rinse them well. After a few hours they are dry and retain their shape. Cheap fun for your little one!!
B00IVNEGLW|2|I purchased this swing for my first daughter 2 years ago and it was amazing. I purchased this swing again for my second daughter and Fisher Price has since updated this swing with low quality parts. The fabric and the comfort of this swing is amazing, the only issue is the mechanical parts of this swing are horrible. The motor on this swing is way to loud and it clicks like crazy. It also shuts itself off after 4 hours. I know letting your baby sleep in a swing is not recommended, but come on, this swing makes it impossible to catch a few desperate minutes of sleep for your newborn and yourself. I regret buying this swing. A couple years ago this swing was amazing, not anymore.
B001AXJ8O0|4|I am the mother to an almost three year old, and am expecting my second boy 4 days after my first boy turns three. While my son doesn't like using strollers right now, I know that when the second baby comes along and begins to ride in the stroller, my first will want to jump back on. That's why I began looking into sit and stand strollers. The Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem stroller had almost everything I needed. I had the universal car seat adapter, and the place in the back for the older child. I ordered a parent organizer for cheap, and it fits perfectly. I do agree with other reviews that when the car seat is on there isn't as much room in the back to sit, and you can't really access the storage underneath, but it is a great stroller. I was able to put it together by myself, and the minute my son saw it he needed to ride on it. We love this stroller!
B00B9ZRZI0|5|I bought my first bouncer for the last two kids. I would put the baby and the baby could distract himself and eventually fall asleep.<br /><br />I wanted another one for the new babies in the family to use when they visit me. I had the opportunity to try it out this week and it was still the same great product I had before.<br /><br />The construction is solid and you do need a Philips screwdriver to put it together. You also need 4 A and 1 D batteries to operate. It took about 10 minutes to put it all together.<br /><br />I really like it as the part where the baby seats is very soft and plushy; plus it is very pretty. It looks like it could wash easily (once I wash it I will update this review).<br /><br />The waterfall and the vibration make a nice touch to an absolute wonderful bouncer. I highly recommend it.
B00D3TPGB8|4|Great little bib to keep in the diaper bag for travelling and eating out.  Can even fit in a purse.  For everyday use I would have liked if it were a little bit longer as it doesn't quite reach the child's waist to catch all that drops and can also get hung up on the tray of a high chair.  For a pack n' go bib though, it's great!
B009JV34RC|5|Great pillow, perfect size for my 2 1/2 year old.
B001BXRMLU|5|Was exactly what I wanted matched everything perfectly
B003SPODNE|5|hello,    we own several sizes of kleen kanteen water bottles.  they are the best because of the options.  when our main spout got damaged, we ordered several more and they are all interchangeable with the different size bottles.  they are very handy, lock very well, have no leaks, and look great.  the provided cap for the spout keeps everything clean.  the delivery service was outstanding.  you can't go wrong with kleen kanteen products.
B009IW2HMA|1|Don't waste your money!!! It is very noisy, not powerful enough and small.<br />I wanted something smaller to make it easier for myself but I am finding myself just pulling the good old blender.
B005C3IT62|4|Item was delivered within 3-4 days of ordering.  It's very cute, but I wish the strings to tie it to the crib were made of a different material, they're satin-y and so they slide a bit.
B0070WGV9K|3|Bought this to use as a rail on a convertible crib and it doesn't really work since it needs to attach to the far side of the mattress as well. It will probably work OK when we switch to twin beds. My only other concer is the extra long strap which could easily be a choking hazard. We cut it to a more reasonable length.
B00D04R3LW|5|Love it. Son enjoys it and it's not bulky
B00GUN3Z1W|4|Purchased to keep a dog out of my son's room in his apartment. He said it works just fine.
B00B7M7BKW|3|Color is almost black, not the grey as in pictures. Product is very nice and works well, but really stands out against my grey leather seats.
B000YDDF6O|4|I bought this toy for my one month old baby... because  he is so small he cant hold it but when the music is playing and the lights are blinking he stops whst he is doing and it holds his focus...if only for a little while...
B00004TFLB|5|Bought several years ago for my first grandchild.  Every grandchild  gets one now unless their sibling passes it down.  Absolutely love it.<br />Beautiful music, add or subtract instruments, or have full orchestra,  on/off switch/  color lights up.  The kids really get into it.  Age 1 to about 4.
B009H9754O|2|Rosary came un connected and with incorrect settings, we had to look up the proper bead count and redo it.
B002NUWQUW|1|Absolutely do not buy this! The zipper is such poor quality. I am a large and the actual bra fits as I followed the size chart on the back of the package, but I have to zip it up first and then pull over my head the zipper, I would say 99% of the time busts open during this process.  In normal life a silly zipper would not make my blood boil, BUT as most of you know reading this, or will soon learn, messing with a zipper at 2 am so you can pump some milk for your screaming newborn is enough to send you over the edge. If you still buy this bra I would recommend either sewing in a better zipper or putting snaps on it.
B0034KQ8JA|5|I was just sewing a button back into this and realized how well it's worn.  2 1/2 years now and the little one has beat it up a bit lately but I was just surprised and how good it still looks.
B00DOGUZQG|5|Made well! We are still new to them, been using them for 2 months with a newborn. I will update as we have them longer.
B001LENCUE|5|I read all these reviews about it's a hassle to clean, WHO CARES?! Honestly, I have a son who has colic and it's amazing how calm he is.Regular bottles made him spit up constantly, hiccup like crazy and the whole time we'd feed him he'd clutch his tummy from gas pains. Now he does none of that!!! He doesn't cry, no spit ups, no hiccups everything is gone. He's content and happy, sleeps better, still has a little gas every now and then but what baby doesn't? It highly recommend these bottles!! It's worth taking some time out of the day to hand wash some bottles for my son.
B00NVFUB6Y|4|Seemed to help but we have a chunker so he could only use it for about 2 weeks
B00005BYUR|2|These bottles leak like crazy if you tighten them too much or not enough.  It takes FOREVER to clean the zillion parts to each bottle.  Not worth it.
B000067EH7|5|This tub is a must have! my baby girl loves to hang out in the bath and since the sling holds the baby and my hands are free to wash her its perfect for those babies that are slippery. I wouldnt want to be without it.
B00EW9RIUK|3|Nice picture but so hard to put on the wall, considering it came all wrinkly and bundled up!
B004JU0H6O|5|Our little girl has spent her first several months sleeping in a play yard so she can be in our room.  Not something we planned on but she has respitory issues so this is what is safest.  Before the mattress she seemed uncomfortable and would wake VERY often, like every 20-30 minutes.  Once we got the mattress she started sleeping much better and within a week she was sleeping for 7 hours straight at night!  This was a dream come true for us :)
B000GB3G04|5|I absolutley love this thing and am thinking about ordering a second one.  The price is right!  The shelves are height adjustable and it spins smoothly.  Baby is 8 months old and has stages 1, 2 and 3 jarred foods that all fit on here (stage 3 are twice the size of stage one).  And what an awesome idea to store spoons at the top!!  Now I don't have to worry about additional germs getting on the spoons.  If you have limited kitchen counter space, this food organizer is IDEAL for you! Get 2!
B007GBT6B0|1|It looks like a puffy Barney,  and the reason I gave it one star, is because the voice is not even close to Barneys,  dissappointed.
B001GQ2PIM|5|I've used it on several vehicles, even when traveling by plane. It's simple to assemble and disassemble, also very simple the machine washable linings.<br />However no The only thing I see is that where the child sits, is very little padding and if it becomes annoying. What I did was put a few layers of foam material is used under carpets.
B00FZGLKQW|5|Great size for on-the-go.
B0000A1O7P|4|Portable, light, easy to put on. However, I prefer the old plastic sassy seats that were easy to wipe off. The cloth cover is washable, but not as easy to deal with. Make sure you put a plastic sheet underneath to catch the food that misses the mouth.
B00F6TZ8QG|5|Thank you!
B00OQXS0OK|5|OM GOSH  this blanket is SOOO soft and cuddley and good size love this blanket!!!
B00FNJ7FUQ|1|The pieces do not fit together.  Im due any day now and stressing because i purchased a bouncer i cannot put together, now im going to have to spend money to send it back, i am very upset and stressed.
B006UDLXGQ|5|These were the perfect size and price for newborn twins. Twins are normally small when born, so we will be using the Boppy longer than babies of single births. Having protection for the head and neck in one unit is a plus. They are well make of quality fabric and should be easy to clean. I gave them as a gift for my grand babies.
B00HHYVT7U|1|My 12 mth old who still puts everything in his mouth occasionally, easily put holes in the rubber on the handle. I have had to start using it myself to feed him so that he wont end up swallowing pieces of rubber. The point of this type of utensil is to help he start to self feed. I should've returned them.
B004HZGW8S|5|I purchased these suspenders for my 15 month old son and love them. They don't come off when he tugs at them, they hold jeans/pants up wonderfully and are super cute.
B00AEUCC16|1|Doesn't really work, just buy clippers
B001OC5UMQ|3|We bought two of these with the intention of using one at the bottom of our stairs and one at the top of our stairs. The one at the bottom of the stairs works well, but we aren't comfortable using this at the top of the stairs. It doesn't feel safe enough as our 1-year old loves to tug on it. Unfortunately we aren't in the window from when we purchased it to send it back, so we've had to hold on to it, but also purchased a different top of the stairs gate instead. One other note - the KidCO y spindles DO NOT work with this gate. We were hoping to use the y spindles to to add extra support to the gate at the bottom of the stairs where they are pressure mounted to the baluster but the KidCo spindles don't fit this Regalo gate.
B003VNKLHA|5|We have an older house with wide doorway and hallway openings. This gate is perfect and simple to install, we have two in our home. I love the latching walk through gate.
B00073HJG8|5|Got these for my girls and they worked perfect!  They hold A LOT of stuffed animals and very easy to install!
B000GKU4Y6|4|As with the Bob Revolution, this weather shield is a great item. I've gone out with it in a complete downpour and my child has been bone dry. My only issue with it is that it is not designed properly for the early stages when your child needs to be reclined. At 2-3 months old, my child did not have enough neck support for him to be upright in the stroller, so I unclipped the back portion of the carriage so he was more prone. This exposed him to the rain since the back yellow flap of the shield is not designed to go that far. I resolved the issue during this period by rigging the yellow flap down over the back of the reclined part of the carriage. Reaching into the back of the stroller from the front, I used three large spring loaded office paper clips (the black kind with silver handles) to hold the yellow flap to the back of the carriage. With this fix, just ensure that the vents are still working at the back. This fix worked for me but I wish Bob had a way of making the shield work for this position as well.
B00005YWN0|5|I already had a monitor but I really wanted a video monitor. I have a six month old that rolls all over in her crib and this would allow me to check on her without going in and disturbing her. After I read some of the reviews and talked to some people on my birth club board I decided I'd try this out. I bought it at Toy R Us knowing they have a good return policy just in case. Well, brought it home, hooked it up, and I think it's amazing! The picture is incredible, even in pitch black! I will say that the sound get's screachy if you turn it up to high, but that's not what I bought it for. I bought if for the video image and it's awesome. I'd say try it out and if it doesn't work for you then you can always take it back.
B009EDSWJA|4|I'll keep it short this has been a great product for us and our 18 month old with one exception -- its perforated.  If you're a naive new parent like we were it may not occur to you that liquids of all sorts may find their way into these perforations with no way to get them or their odors out. For me its a good product and i'm sure there are good reasons to make this item breathable, but this is a drawback leading me to purchase another one already and it won't be this one due to this \\"feature\\".
B007D1NKK6|4|Note that in order to use this bed rail, you must remove the mattress and strap the bed rail around the box spring.  The description on Amazon's website does not tell you this.  You really need 2 people to remove a mattress, especially on a bed that is bigger than a single bed.
B002M77N22|5|I went ahead and bought this sleeper and I am so glad I did!  After my c-section I had trouble climbing into the bed so I put the sleeper next to the couch.  Later on, we were able to easily move it to the bedroom.  My son loved to be rocked in it and the angle enabled him to see me when I put him down into it.<br /><br />It's lightweight and portable, so it was perfect when the in-laws came to visit and decided to stay in a hotel almost 2 hours away or when I took my son to the babysitter's house while we were having work done at our house.  I think this would be wonderful for grandparents/other people the baby frequently visits to have handy at their house as well because it folds and can be put away.  It easily fit into the trunk of my car.<br /><br />The yellow one comes with a little rabbit with a square of fabric attached and it rattles a little.  My son (now 8 months) loves this little toy and it's the perfect size for him to hold.<br /><br />I did read the warnings about the babies developing flat heads or their heads tilting to one side so I bought a Snuzzler to go with the sleeper.  Problem solved.  When our son was a newborn, we put the entire Snuzzler in with him and we were still able to buckle him in.  When he got older, we just used the part that went under his head.  It helped keep him snug and on his back.<br /><br />Overall this is a wonderful item, especially for those with limited space available, babies with reflux (a problem we thankfully didn't have), or for overnight stays with the baby.  It's affordable too, so I would also give this at a baby shower.
B0016DXZNE|4|the material is a tad different from the first one I bought and the feel of the material is the whole reason my little one likes it so much(supposed to be same exact product)
B005IWMB3E|2|I ordered these rattles because my kid likes shiny things - who doesn't, right?  When it arrived I pulled it out of the box and it looked used.  Under the plastic outer case were scratches in the silver plastic and trapped particles of some sort.  I had never returned anything to Amazon before and didn't want to go through the return process so I decided to keep them assuming the plastic outer case was sealed.  But, when I washed them I had the same experience as the other reviewer - soapy water became trapped below the clear outer case.  I'm not sure they will ever really be clean and in time trapped water may cause mildew.<br /><br />I'm giving this 2 stars because when I did decide to return the item Amazon was great about it and provided a full refund without having to return the item.  The Amazon return process was much easier than I expected.<br /><br />As for this item, they will probably be going into the trash.
B001A0K43M|4|The pillow is pricey, but it is what it is. This pillow has helped a lot. I've been able to sleep a lot better since I got it.
B000GBIKWI|3|These are very good, sturdy big covers.  the problem is that they don't fit well in a normal purse - they are more for if you carry a backpack or diaper bag or extra big purse.  Also, they aren't flushable I don't think so you have to take it to the trash after use. The size and convenience (flushability) aside, these are good for young kids who need to hold on still and that makes the standard covers too small.
B003ULP59M|5|awesome organizer
B00208KJ0G|5|My little boy had been biting up all three sides of his (expensive!) wooden crib, with me shaking my head in despair, until my sister saw what he'd done and mentioned a CRIB GUARD to me. As a first-time mom, I'd never heard of these clever little contraptions before, but I hopped on Amazon and ordered the highest-rated one I found. I was not disappointed. The Trend-Lab guards are high-quality, easy to use, and most importantly, they work great! They are thick and have a great water-proof underside to prevent my son's teeth and drool from further damaging his crib. Highly recommend this product.
