B000GV3J7Y|5|Perfect replacement and it looks soooo much better!
B0074ZL828|5|Love these grips! Fast shipping!
B00BHD6710|1|Not worth
B0006IX87S|4|This is my second fresh water filter i have purchased for our RV. They work great. I would not hook up my RV to campground water supply without it!
B005PZMKZI|5|Exellent
B00HFWYZO8|4|Fits my 2005 Ford Escape with no cutting necessary, though the front mats are a little narrow. I would have given a 5th star if they were wider. There is no odor and the rubber seems to be pretty flexible and grips well, allowing them to stay in place.
B00AOA8012|5|Works as expected.
B00032KBFE|5|worked fine.
B008JPYXIS|5|Fit perfectly in my 06 Acura TL 3.2. Easy to put in.
B008DUUA7C|4|Fit great and worked good
B000C7RZBS|5|Perfect fit in my '95 Volvo 940, and finding all-brass heater cores for older model cars is getting harder and harder. The R&R procedure is a pain in the butt, hopefully this one lasts ~20 years like the original did.
B00K1HPPMK|5|I've taken the newly mounted cb and antenna on some pretty rough trails that past few weeks, and am happy to say nothing vibrated loose and worked well even on nasty washboards and when rock climbing in 4 low with both diffs locked up.
B004Y9YIU6|5|wal-mart has the same lights for $35, so yea great for the price
B000BZAEGY|5|As expected ... a quality component.  GOOD price.  FAST  Delivery .  What else do you need to know ?
B00VUP3Y34|5|EXTRA BRIGHT Fit in my dual brake/tail lights.....Safety is my concern.
B0002CAD9Y|5|Hose didn't fix my fuel issue but as far as the hose goes have not complaints
B00BHM5OS8|5|The EVS Sports R3 Race collar is perfect and well worth the money.  Thank you!
B0024NWW9I|5|great replacement product.
B00UGZ2SIQ|5|good
B00DBENFIG|4|Bought for my 06 mustang dome light. I had to modify my cover to fit them in. If I have to do it again I would have found a smaller bulb.
B001TI5IIQ|1|No  good
B00KSF291K|5|I love this bumper sticker! I bought 2 and gave 1 to my sister.
B000F2ZYHC|5|Looks great.  So far, no need to use the included 2-sided tape to hold it in place.
B00CS7T0IQ|5|very well pleased
B00XZ9N2F8|5|Easy to program. Just follow the directions with the correct sequencing and you'll be using the new remote in less than a minute.
B008C8WDR0|5|works good pretty bright its a light bulb.
B007KP52QU|5|Fit was great.
B00H91SB4U|5|Fitted my truck to the T.
B009DK6A2U|5|It looks beautiful on my car
B0002SA40Q|5|works great provides shade and protects front passengers in rain.!!))
B00EE56UAG|4|Locks well
B0058DIDTY|5|I usually do not write reviews for anything, but i think this needs to be said. This vinyl wrap looks like the real deal at first glance, not kidding at all. its a 60&#34; by 20&#34; roll, which is 5ftx2ft=10ft total wrap give or take. Im saying this because there is 3m grade product for sale by the foot on amazon for 11$ a foot.... do the math which is cheaper for purchase. Besides, this is a 3m product anyways! do not know how that works but fine by me lol. I wrapped my center faceplates with this vinyl and it took me about 3-4hours to complete all of this (1st time ever wrapping). Yes its not perfect around the radio, but thats my fault not the wrap. Its holding up very well in heat as well! The process is used was i wrap the item first (make sure to prep the surface your are adhering to!), then heated it up with a wagner heat gun (hairdryer may suffice), and then putting a LIGHT coat of clearcoat over the top. I say light because the silver portion of the carbon fiber fades to black if too much clear coat is applied (2-3 coats). I sprayed it on heavy in the backside so that the clearcoat would keep the wrap in place. for 20 bucks (w/ expidited shipping), i think that for the money this is the best wrap you can buy period!
B000JZT0FC|5|Used these parts as opposed to those that came with the parking brake pads, much better quality.  Well worth the money and not to reuse dirty parts.
B004ZP3EJU|5|Nice product
B0051WJEZY|5|any problem
B00IS94J8E|5|Good fit
B00CSXJPFS|4|Very high quality, washed bumper, wiped down with denatured alcohol,  used spacers where indicated and lined up arrow with center of latch as instructed. It stuck great but then i realized the alignment arrow was offset to the right  about a 1/2&#34; so its not perfectly centered. Shame on me for not double checking. It's very nice though just be sure to measure your alignment arrow before installing.
B004TOZRMO|5|Amazing difference switching to this shift knob from my previous one. From the look, to the amazing weight! Shifts are so much smoother, especially paired with a short shifter.
B000CLJTKE|5|I bought to sets of these style brake pads ... one set for my Honda Accord, and another for my Honda Odyssey. They have been on my vehicles for about 2 months, and they work well, and sound nice (very quiet).
B002MGKN2A|3|It did great on her first excursion of 2k miles plus.  Honda Metropolitan sat solidly and well balanced.  I used a two device anti-wobble system; the one supplied and the kind that works as the &#34;cotter&#34; pin with a bolt (WalMart).  However, VERY disappointed with rusting!!  All over in spots inside tube, and other places.  Went through some rain and nearly the day after, rust!!!!<br />Also, the ramp storage holes (also rusted)  would not line up with the bolts (you guessed it, rusted as well)  and I had to drill another hole.  This is no biggie, but, this should not be.  Someone is not paying attention!!  There have been several posts about this.
B00LMNB6IE|5|Beautiful top!
B001JSY9Q8|5|Works well once I smoothed the coin openings. Plenty of room in the lower compartment for quarters
B00QKYNHXM|5|Parts fit my 2006 325i BMW perfectly
B00D8LA0SK|5|everything went great
B00T7GYDTC|3|A
B003RQBKLC|3|Works super well but is sensitive to bumps and becomes disconnected.
B000JFJLP6|5|Super to carry with you for those emergencies, whether they're your own or to help someone else !
B004C443SK|5|cool!!
B00UBNH2W0|5|The Polisher was exactly as expected and works great! Its a huge advantage in detailing and helps to achieve absolute perfection in paint. I must say Gloss-its customer service was the shining star of my experience. My Evo 21 showed up with a minor crack in the plastic housing, Jacob at Gloss-it sent me the replacement piece immediately after I contacted and provided tracking info, all at no cost to me. I'd suggest the Evo 21 to anyone looking for a high class orbital. The Evo 21 is as good or better than the Rupes and the Flex, and much less expensive. Thanks again Jacob!
B00RZHG3PM|5|Exactly what I wanted.  Quick and great product.
B004AIIVUO|5|Great fit, easy install and fixed my window.
B007ZJTYZ6|1|It was gift and person said it was great
B0009NUG66|5|Arriving today from New York to Houston Texas. Excellent performance and security. Without issues. Was a great purchase.
B00H3ZCRDI|5|Fits perfectly and functions nearly so. I do wish the surface was a little tackier to help keep items from sliding, but that's a minor quibble. I recommend this to anyone who wants to keep the cargo area clean.
B0032J1KAK|2|Very very cheap!
B00EI6CKVE|4|Good product, read and follow directions precisely.
B00G09LTAK|5|Good kit.<br />Included many common adapters to fit most uses.<br /><br />Used it to press bushing and balljoints on a 4wd truck.  Nice not to have to rent a tool that's usually abused or damaged.
B00TO7NM6Y|4|it does what it's supposed to. good quality. recommended
B00COOS5NY|4|I love the lights put them on my 2005 z71 Tahoe it really bring the whit out on my truck getting the fog lights nexts
B00HS5V3Y2|4|Just got these today. The rotors do have straight cooling vanes. Upon inspection, the pads seem to be in excellent condition. Then inspecting the first rotor, everything seemed fine, no scratches or dents. Moving onto the next rotor, I found one deep scratch and another mild scratch. I'll sand them smooth to make the edges flush and update later when I install them to tell how they perform.<br /><br />Update after installing<br /><br />Before I installed the rotors, I painted them black, mainly for rust prevention. So far, the brakes are great. There is a difference when I brake, I can stop quicker now which is a big plus.
B0016KFVJS|5|Love it
B00INZ65B2|5|I've had them installed for a few months now with no issues.
B00LDOO1J8|5|Easy to replace old case with this. Works perfectly after 3 months. Like OEM.
B004G9KVS2|5|Noticeable horsepower gain at the pedal. Performs flawlessly so far. The true test will be when I I have my cabover camper on while towing a 21 ft jet sled over the mountain passes.
B004J398Y8|5|After $238K miles on my prius I thought it was a good time to replace the MAF sensor.  Installed the sensor in a snap and immediately began seeing better fuel mileage.
B00HLYJBWG|3|Okay
B000VUB4CW|5|Works great on my 2007 Honda Fit.
B009II5CMQ|5|work perfectly at a great price.
B000HEBR3I|3|The product is awesome and does its job perfect. The shipping speed was the slowest I think I've had in anything ever!!!!
B00P0HD802|1|Unreliable   i ordered this in February and the camera has already messed up on me at least a dozen times.  1. Hard time formatting the memory card for the dash cam  2. half of the videos that are supposedly recorded aren't.  3. the battery has crapped out on me after just 6 months of use.  4. &#34;infrared&#34; lighting is a just a regular light.  5. the camera will automatically shut off on you randomly  6. very unpredictable camera. don't know when it will record and not record
B00GI2CBIS|5|Unlike flimsy  sunshades, this auto shade is very substantial. The fit is perfect for my Toyota Camry, shading all the leather interior . I LVE the zebra print, so much more fun then the traditional silver shade, although one side is traditional silver. I was so happy to review this product. here in the south, summers with temps in the 100's are bad news for leather. This product takes care of my car!
B008S9LGFS|5|Very well made products.  have been using tec mate for years and all products associated with them are top notch.  Durable and work great
B001DRJO3S|5|bough it a few times already. works as excepted
B00E9BPWSG|5|Cute statement of support for my favorite breed.
B0007M1ZGE|5|This didn't work for my travel trailer, so I needed to order a different type (one with U bolts - Ultra-Fab Products 35-946402 Universal Hitch).  This WILL fit a 4&#34; bumper (might be tight and need some force to get on as mine did).  It did not work for me because my bumper is not fully extended out past the body of the trailer.  Your bumper must have clearance on the backside of the bumper to allow for the back plate to push up and then allow for the insertion of the bolts. I did read some reviews before purchasing this item and heard of the not fitting.  The reviewers failed to give details.  I hope this helps anyone looking to purchase a hitch like this.  I am rating it a 5 as the product itself is very sturdy and well built.  It just didn't work for me and that is not the fault of the product or the manufacture.
B0061M9RBY|2|One fan plastic was not shipped w/order one was metal no match but both are working
B00498ZQCG|5|Exactly what I needed.  Cheaper than most and works great so far!
B00PJDT0LI|5|6'1&#34; 190 lbs. XL fits nicely with the sleeves being just a touch short. L would be more fitting in the body but sleeves even shorter for my long arms (35&#34;). Just rode last night in some unexpected rain and the jacket was marvelous at wind and water resistance, my Tshirt was not wet at all. Vents are sufficient in 80degree weather as long as you're moving. This jacket is an excellent buy.
B00DBEO7LA|2|Not very bright, certainly not good enough as a map light or reading light, i took these out and bought the 16 leds and those r waay better
B00E5OUOCQ|2|VERY small!  Did not fit my Sienna minivan and barely fit my husbands Hyundai Elantra. I measured my window and it appeared it would only be an inch too small but the fabric edges just collapse and make it WAY too small. ***When you measure and look to purchase a shade, go by the measurements of the round wired part!!*** That is the only part that will really matter because the edges will just collapse.
B000BZL0LC|5|half the cost of OEM and works just as well.
B00DVWH1HY|5|The stickers were clean and free of debris. The backing came off easily and the stickers adhered to the auto window I applied them to without issue. A great product!
B009LRUJOU|4|Great inexpensive easy to install replacement part for my vehicle.  Work great, my only complaint is that the hatch is a little harder to close now than before - takes more muscle to close. Not terribly difficult but different than the original. I'd still purchase again and recommend them though.
B000C55XT6|5|I must say, I am impressed. This inner tie rod is a very solid part. It feels better, and looks sturdier than the OEM part I pulled out. Now to see if it lasts the test of time. I will update this review in the future (6 months to 2 years) to tell you all how it is holding up!
B00063XX5U|3|It does the job, somewhat well thought out. Just be sure to watch a video first as the instructions on the back are incomplete. Being my first time I wasn't aware how the bands actually stayed tight, when you tighten them you must bend the tab up WITH the tool still tight or you ruin the band when you cut it.
B00OZDMCSQ|1|So I purchased 2 of these about 2 months ago, and I'm hooking the first one up for the first time today, a section of the leds didn't turn on. Not impressed by any means, but you get what you pay for. I'll see how the second one does in the next few days Not even a year later half of one is out, and the 2nd is completely dead, will be tossing this Chinese garbage and seek an American replacement
B0016IDVGK|5|Quick shipping, easy for my non-mechanic hubby to install.
B006VFL0SO|5|Makes good hookah bong hose
B00K7935KQ|3|These license plate frames came up for a search for motorcycle license plate frames, and there was no size listed, so my assumption was they were for motorcycles. They are definitely NOT. These are for standard size automobile license plates. For what they are, I guess they're OK.
B00KBINF7G|4|I have not tested it on a car yet, but overall feel and charge is good so far.
B00S4HFNXK|5|Here's what I really like about this style of fender. It doesn't blow up with air, so no chance of a puncture rendering it useless.  This model also has nice PLASTIC grommets which make it easy to attach permanently to a dock without worrying about the metal tarnishing. The &#34;contour&#34; comes into play when hanging from a boat gunwale, it can &#34;fold over&#34; and match the curve of the hull. The included lines are of high quality, although they could be a tad longer.
B00D8LA0SK|5|hard to find - perfect  for my carbon 22 gmc sierra. matches perfect. I love it.
B00XV4ZXPO|5|Jacket fits true to size, zipper works great, and it has tons of pockets. I took it for a trial run in 78 degree weather and it was comfortable with the jacket unzipped.
B0052LGF5G|3|Kinda small
B003IVX7J4|5|Will bubble up but it's a beautiful sticker
B0007ZL174|5|Fit perfectly on our horse trailer roof.
B0066QER74|5|This is a really great jacket.  I have owned several jackets that were much more expensive and this matches up to most.  I love the ability to open all of the vents of which there are many and the air really flows through.  For a heavy 3 season jacket it is well worth the money.
B007IZX3IG|4|This was a good replacement for my broken key, However keep in mind you cant just replace the plastic top and put your cut key in the new top.  The key is not removable so you must then take it to a lock smith and get the key part cut (~$8).
B00K2QRYQ0|5|Just what I wanted
B006E0KSK2|5|Fits my 2005 Toyota Sinnea AWD, the AWD does make a difference....
B00QU6MAV0|1|Is bad is came brock
B000ALBZK8|1|I bought this to re-attach a side view mirror.  My readings said to use this stuff instead of the sticky pads included with the glass.  I followed the instructions to the letter.  It held well for a couple weeks, but then lost its grip on the mirror housing and came loose.  The worst part is that the mass of epoxy still clung to the glass, so I had to buy yet another new piece.  This time, I just used the stickies that came with the glass.
B0016ITCVS|2|So far no leaks, but I had to go buy a torch and pipe bender because the pipes were bent the opposite way. It was a real PITA. I'd rather spend a few extra $ on parts that actually fit.
B0043SCBD4|5|Very good product, it secures my trk bed, very hard to detect and removed.  It prevents the tailgate from being stolen.
B00RCEIWV6|5|Product was just as described. Very inexpensive accessory that gives your car a custom look.
B0045VC2GA|5|I keep this set of wrenches in my truck, since I always seem to have my truck closer by than my toolbox when I need a wrench.  No problems with these whatsoever.  I use the largest one as a lever to adjust the manual top link on my tractor.  Really saves my knuckles from getting banged up!
B00R3KUS3Y|3|The fan shroud barely fit and this was a replacement. The company is very easy to work with but it seems to be lacking a little on the quality control side.
B00DNJQ2YI|5|Holy crap is this an amazing cover. I ride an 83 goldwing.  Without the back luggage case, this thing fits like a custom glove. Sturdy but delicate.  Sounds wierd, I know.  Be careful pulling over brake and clutch handles.
B006EN689E|5|Excellent
B00K72C1T4|5|Keeps the batteries good
B00CS8BJI4|5|Great product, great price, great customer service. Highly recommended!!!!!! Just a tip, order one size bigger than you normally wear. I usually wear a medium and ordered a large and they fit perfect.
B0001EW03A|4|Function & form, nice job AVS. Could be a little better in the fitment, I can see where I'll have to replace the 3M adhesive on these in a couple years. But overall I'm happy.
B00LB17IP2|4|Look good..
B000CM3I2S|3|Its not glass
B001GH1PU0|5|Great switches I will keep buying these!
B00CRT8VPS|1|As one person already stated they are very small. Probably made  for women and children but they wont fit most men  who are likely to purchase this item for work. don't waste your money
B002713IUY|5|Solid and the leather is off a very good quality.
B0076NQ6XO|3|color match was good but the paint was thick and before i could use it one month later that product was too thick and dried out to use even thought the top was on very tight to prevent it from doing so.
B00BLKXW9O|5|Direct replacement for expensive Volvo ATF. Save $
B00KTIUG5C|5|easy to program for a 2010 F250SD.
B008U1KO0M|5|I have had it on for a month now and not issues.  Seems to be a quality product.
B00EPDLCSM|5|Looks great on the wifes White SUV.
B00B5VN94W|5|This is awesome works great I've had to replace two brake lines and it works great shaped the lines just like the old ones New one went back on the car so easy thanks
B003LVWLCA|5|Great product and I still do not understand why Flaming charges so much for this product.  I guess we pay for a quality product which it is definitely.
B0017OGD04|5|Does a fine job. Wish it was a little longer . But can't have Ur cake and eat it to
B00029XHZ4|1|junk--doesn't work
B00ANVNVB6|3|I had 1 tab missing out of the box. Installed in summer. Expected them to be a little less brittle. Still, they stay on, and the finish is good. A good buy overall to dress up a small car.
B00LHNVKTY|5|Perfect
B001AT20MG|5|Nice items. Quick turn around.
B00SY416RU|2|I thought the cord would be longer and it falls out of the lighter hole
B00LTYA31C|5|Looks great I got the C5 cover. It looks like it came from the factory that way. It covers up any little crack in the vynal
B000CO8SCG|4|Well built and easy install
B000HDWXHI|5|Good quality!
B00VWYWFHE|3|could not justify the prices...afterwards...<br /><br />the heater hose is really really had to get on as the fitment is tight....
B00YBGAYLE|5|Nice add on.
B00E1V2OVM|5|Loved the plate,  everyone thinks I'm from California it's so real looking,  I'll definitely be buying another soon
B00C5R9CJ6|3|For the price it works pretty good. I had to get the lower part of exhaust reworked to fit the new down pipe.
B00GSAUHB8|4|Like the product
B000VWS5ZY|1|Very poor quality:did not fit the locks,rough finish.I had to return and will never buy from them again,
B0018GVUHC|5|It did exactly as I hoped
B0082AOSEO|1|These are junk, I got suckered.
B00WHW227I|4|Does not fit as tight as the original but it does allow the spare to &#34;breathe,&#34; keeping moisture and mold to a minimum.
B005N71G2Q|5|Great shirt for my runs with the guard
B00JLBDCFO|3|Do they work while you're at the dock, yes. I don't like the fact that you can not keep them on while riding. I personally think they are way over priced.
B004J00GII|1|collapses and don't stay shut
B00RW7WTVW|5|Great quality at the right price
B006CN9FNM|5|Great kit easy to work with
B00EXIEVO6|5|this thing sucks
B00F2OKXEC|5|on time and what I orderer would buy again
B00ELHT5J0|5|This great product at great price . I could actually hear the differance (quiet motor)
B003808EWA|5|Great sound, easy to install
B000E7SY02|4|Brackets are a bit close, hard to load mountain bikes
B006ODTR0G|5|Received Honda exhaust extension on time and is just what I wanted.
B00L32LGKM|4|fits just fine. not much trouble installing. done in 30 minutes
B000NW4OPC|5|Exact part, fairly priced, fast stellar, would recommend to friends.
B00RW3OC3Y|1|The cap doesn't seal properly and I ended up with water in my gas tank. Caused a major problem and a lot of time to correct....I don't think the gasket kit comes with is thick enough.
B00T7EN6MY|5|Perfect
B005C43YHU|5|Outstanding product, made our Volvo XC70 look like new. Also it covers a lot of surface and can be used certainly more than twice.
B00CUBMJBA|4|The carb worked great but the stems at the top that the cables go in to were too long so I used the ones off the old carb. The price was the best part.
B00QX64HWW|4|We really like & are very happy with our new seat covers.
B007BYHWOA|5|Have the life proof nude so you can see it and it's protected.
B000FW2NEY|5|Fits the steering wheel, much cooler when the car is out in the summer sun.
B0029TQDLA|1|They melt and wart does not stand up in the,sun
B004VFYCZE|4|As expected!
B000182F1S|4|Works
B000CC98VI|4|Nice snug fit.  Good feel.  Not like the steering wheel wraps I remember from long ago--better quality.  The color was a tinge off.  I ordered blue but there was a purplish hue to it against my otherwise 67 Ford blue vinyl interior.  I'd buy it again
B003SWNVL2|5|I can honestly say that after reading the mixed reviews on this product I was a little skeptical that it would come through for me on our camping trip. I am very happy I purchased this and would recommend it to anyone who asks me about it. It held more than I expected it would and once the eight straps were secured, the carrier did not budge one inch from where I attached it to the roof racks. Without a doubt, this is one of my better purchases - online and in-store.
B000ABIDJE|3|Removed light grease in engine bay, but nothing really caked on.<br /><br />I applied this to a cool engine, but on a 90 degree sunny day.<br />I used the &#34;mist&#34; setting on my garden hose spray nozzle to gently went the engine bay (Just a bit of mist)<br />used about 1/5th of a bottle using a spray bottle to all the nooks and crannies of the engine bay.<br />I covered up the battery terminal, air intake and the fuse box (as directed in the car manual Ford Expedition EL Limited 2007)<br />I let it sit for 15 minutes and rinsed using garden hose with spray nozzle in the &#34;stream&#34; setting&#34; then &#34;flat&#34; setting.<br />While it did remove &#34;some&#34; gunk, it left a lot behind.<br />I then used another 1/5 of the bottle to re-apply to the areas where it was still very dirty. Waited 20 minutes and rinsed again using garden hose. This really didn't remove anything more than the first time.<br /><br />I then used an air compressor with a nozzle to get rid of any pooled water in the engine bay (particularly near electrical connections, coil over plug wells etc) and let it sit to dry for about 4 hours. After it was dry, the engine bay looked worse because now you saw more of the dirt and general grime. Using simply a wet microfiber cloth got a lot of the hoses and plastics much more cleaner than this product.<br /><br />I think this product is very useful for cases where you've had a bit of spill in the engine bay (e.g. spill power-steering fluid while filling it up), then you would use this product to clean up the hard to reach places. Otherwise, I think using the same amount of time as you would with this product, it would be better to hand detail the engine bay.
B00K1171W8|5|No problems just what I needed
B00CZEZNGU|5|Easy to install though a little smaller than our originals so I couldn't hide all the mounting holes. The lights are nice and bright making it much easier to see inside our traiker.
B00Y3FJGK8|4|Good mirror. Mounted easy, but with upper bag, its awkward. After a few dusty rides, it already looks weathered.
B001DEPOLC|4|I use this to store all of my Barber equipment. Good price for storing important materials.
B000WK5N14|1|These have only three tabs to hold in place.  The OEM lens have four tabs.  These Kuryakyn Deep Dish fell out after only two hours of riding.  Three tabs do not hold the additional weight in the OEM sockets.
B0062ZGYNE|5|I have used SenSen struts on an Accord before purchasing these for my GTI.  Good quality OEM replacement.
B000Z2CDU8|5|everything it is suppose to be
B00EHLUAXU|5|We bought two of these singles and they work great.
B00RM327NG|3|Really easy to put up. Strong Magnets. I like that it has the outer magnet and the one that goes in the case. I used both and both work pretty well. The outer magnet seems stronger, but the one that goes in the case also did the job. Only negative is that it is sometimes hard to keep the mount in place in the air vent. When I am done and try to pull it off, sometimes it comes off the air vent and if i try and turn my phone sometimes it tends to loosen up a bit. Other wise i like how easy to use it is
B00HLW18T2|4|Great lights very bright. I use them driving through back roads on my motorcycle at night
B00BQYCIVI|4|Perfect
B000BUQOGI|5|I hope this short review helps you in your shopping. I always depend on them when I shop. This is a great product. We run into a variety of electrical situations when we go out in our RV. So I have adapters for 50 amp. and 30 amp. and one to hook up to a standard 20 amp when we are home. This is one of the adapters. It is heavy duty and well made. And that is about all you can say about it. But that is about all that needs to be said.
B000AMLWH8|5|I love Meguiar's products.  This is just like the other, awesome!!!
B00KYYAJM6|5|It was the exact fit and came quicker than expected.
B003U2P17W|5|Solved the problem/at much lower price than at a Dealer!!!
B000MT7OSK|4|I use these with the strap outside my helmet and really appreciate how well the strap stays in position. I like the smaller profile of these goggles compare to the ones I've worn previously, but one unfortunate result is that they cut off a fair amount of my peripheral vision making over the shoulder traffic checks difficult.
B0015RQRRW|5|It is definitely a filter
B005DM5MX0|5|Perfecet
B00BG8OFW4|5|This fit our truck perfect and it was very easy to put on .
B00DMLFWOS|5|It'so a great product and came in the mail fast
B007HOGOFW|5|Good enough to prevent a kid from walking away with a bike in a crime of convenience.<br /><br />Would barely even slow down a determined bike thief, but that's not what a product like this is for.
B00LDRA342|5|Great lights with a affordable price! Makes my Camry stand out!
B00D9C2CDO|5|We bought this to use on a family vacation from Nebraska to San Diego CA. It fit luggage for 7 people. No wear was noticed from the drive. We also drove through 3 storms with heavy rains and high winds but our belongings stayed dry. Highly recommend this product.
B002DPBI74|5|This jack is by far the smoothest operating one I've ever used. I will be putting the same type on all my trailers
B00KTI9UQ8|5|Worked as advertised - including instructions.
B00V30J86I|1|This looked cool for the first 5 minutes until the clips attaching it broke off. It will cost me more in gas and shipping to send it back. I really had high hopes for it but, the clips are too cheaply built to function.
B00QHQK9RU|4|Not quite as awesome as I had hoped for but it's useful.<br />The net goes across the back of the trunk closest to you.  It's just a pocket you can stuff things in and keep them from flying around in your trunk.  It attaches to 4 knobs inside the trunk.<br />It will hold a case of water and a bit more.
B0002NIJVC|5|They look good on my ford ranger
B00G4BXSGM|4|No problems worked as headlights  should .
B00GSAUHB8|4|Love the product and works better than what I was previously using. It took a few times to figure out how to close the sunshade but I'm sure I could have read the comments on Amazon to figure that out easier. Very happy with my purchase and am encouraging my partner to purchase one as well
B00SYFJ9F0|5|perfect, just what we expected
B00J4PKASO|5|nice stuff
B00EUICU9W|5|Purchased as a gift for my S.O. and he loved it! Easy to put on yourself, as I had to by flashlight in the middle of the night so he could walk out to his surprise. Makes him beam with pride every time someone mentions it.
B00RRBP424|5|Awesome sauce!
B00WM2I19G|5|fast shipping & it works great so far
B007HBWAX0|5|I installed these steps in my drive way.  It would have been easier if the truck had been on a lift so I could have walked under it instead of crawled under it.  Many times.<br />  The wiring was the hard part.  Bolting the steps on was relatively easy.<br />  The instructions called for installing the control box, then plugging in the wiring harness.  But, because of tight access, I couldn't plug the  harness into the controller when it was installed.  So, I had to remove it.  Even with it removed, it was very difficult to make the connection.  I had to use my work bench vise, to hold the controller, in order to generate enough force to compress the gasket between the controller and harness plug before the plug would lock into place.<br />  Access was also difficult in other places; that is you needed two hands in a space where only one hand would fit.  This happened at the controller, plugging in the wiring harness; at the motor cover with the plastic rivets; and splicing the light pig tails into the wiring harness at the steps.<br />  The wires leading to the back step lights on both sides were longer than needed, the wires leading to the front lights were a little too short.  I had to splice extra wire on the passenger side front light.<br />  The instructions that came with the power step were for model years 2008 through 2015.  Unfortunately, they didn't accurately show the pins and wires my 2010, or any other year, for that matter.  The illustrations were too small to see what was what, and a critical arrow supposedly pointing to the proper wire, was pointing into space.  Splicing the step wires into the truck wiring is important, so it needs to be done correctly.  I could have called for help, which may have been the intention, but instead, I down-loaded an alternate set of instructions that covered fewer model years, but had better pictures, and a properly placed arrow.  The wiring turned out ok.<br />  The steps have to be installed a little far back from the front of the truck to accommodate Tundra's curves in the stowed position.  The steps are completely functional, but a little awkward-looking when parked/stowed.  My truck is white, the steps are black, so it is probably more noticeable on my truck than it would be on a darker truck.  It would be nice if the steps were contoured to fit the truck's curves so they could be installed a little further towards the front.  Or, maybe auxiliary molding made available as part of the step kit, or sold separately, to cover the space between the front of the step and the wheel well since the step cannot be installed all the way forward.<br />  The steps are long enough for the crew cab, so are too long for double cab, which is a shorter truck.  The instructions call for cutting 15.5” from each step when installing them on the double cab.  I opted not to shorten them so I could stand on the extra length to reach into the truck bed.<br />  All in all, I like the steps a lot.  The components seem to be high quality.  They operate as they are supposed to; the lights work.  They actually look pretty good, and make it a lot easier to get into the truck, which is why I bought them.  I'd buy 'em again.accommodate Tundra's curves in the stowed position.  The steps are completely functional, but a little awkward-looking when parked/stowed.

B00VVG8950|3|I use Sirus so the loss of reception was not much of a factor. I would not even think about buying this if you do not use Sirus, XM or your phone for music. In S. Florida I expected to get more reception of FM stations. Regardless it does look good replacing the factory antennae make the Jeep windshield easier to clean and reduces wind noise.
B00PRQ3914|5|Perfect fit to my daughter's green beetle.
B00FDGZIFI|4|Excellent product. Just what I wanted. Wires could have been a bit longer for easier installing.
B003UXUGUI|5|FAST SHIPPING, NICE BAG.  THANK YOU
B00B9EWHGQ|5|Perfect, just as advertised!
B0006MTRJ2|5|Working great!
B001BS9K3I|5|Fits like it should, and fast processing and shipping! On a side note: This one has a housing made of plastic, but the one I pulled off of my truck had what appeared to be a metal housing. Hopefully this does not affect the longevity of the new part, but it is OEM...
B000E3FEZY|5|Great bang for the buck shocks. Same as Quadratec &#34;Hydro 7.0&#34; but with red boots and Skyjacker decals.
B000LGAT0E|4|Excellent replacement! ! ! ! !
B00DP5LCRW|3|The letters look great--and so far seem to have good adhesion.  The letters and numbers are not well organized on the many sheets and are somewhat difficult to find.  Also, it might be nice to include something to help line them up on your watercraft.
B0040HA9Y6|5|Good set. use them in the shop all the time. Will order again.
B006TOGX16|5|beautiful  couldn't wait to get it  came when suppose to.
B00HZ27K6I|5|Fit great
B008K7ZIFW|3|The instructions didn't come with this item!
B00M78820I|5|I am very happy with the product; it is both sturdy and flexible and it works! I have recommended the product to my friends.
B002R0LJFG|5|worked &fit well
B00G4RZZOE|5|This arrived on time. Even though we are in 100 degree Texas weather, the paint arrived safe and sound. I did a little bit of touch up on the front bumper of my Lexus.  The paint color matched with my car well.  I can still see the little touchup job that I did but I am happy with it because I am not professional and this is the best that I can do!
B001HZKGCE|4|handy
B000NPUJQC|5|These are great for making order in your tool box
B00E1SMDU2|5|Good price.<br />Nice stout looking product.<br />Fast delivery
B000EDUTR2|4|good
B000E8T83S|5|Works great - especially with MAG1 synthetic 5w30 oil!!
B002JFQFNA|5|awesome thanks
B004C5P98W|5|Very Efficient Product!  Well built!  Relatively easy to install!
B009HQ7FX8|5|My husband was able to fix our basement door handle with this and it worked perfectly. This was on our RV.
B00QNUO7FK|5|fantastic products!
B00CZG1ZRY|2|It didn't fit the NC Quick Pass transponder.
B00UA7RAQU|2|The wires did not hook up to the car I got them for. And the wires that came with it did not even plug into each other. I had to cut the wires and fix it myself.
B001FCV8QM|5|Put on puts out great stuffer eat fit & finish.....a little pricey but quality
B004C443QW|2|I bought them in XXXL to be sure they would fit. But, I can't even get them on. I normally wear a XXL. They see to be decent, but run WAY small. You would need to get them at least 2 sizes larger than you normally wear, and even then they might be too tight. Be sure you want them as returmn shipping is only .98 cents less than cost, even through Prime.
B006X8AHWY|5|Great parts, fast shipping. Clear communication. excellent purchase
B000GD5FMY|4|I love that they come in both smoke and clear. A bit tight, but they won't blow off.
B00W4B525Q|1|Did not work as advertised.
B00Q3UQQPO|2|When I got it the software wouldn't even install.
B00CKZJH1Q|5|These lights are amazing! There is a big difference from the standard lights and these. With these lights you can see a lot better and they are a lot brighter!  I would recommend​ these lights to everyone!
B000FW4LT4|5|Brass is best for scratch free glass. This model is a wee bit small so I will keep one in each car for when I am unprepared with the larger scraper.<br /><br />I did not like that this was an add on only item.
B00BYH6C1E|5|This is a great product.  So much so that my wife now wants one for her van.  I would HIGHLY recommend this product if stuff falls between your seats.
B00K7938LW|1|Doesn't fit my car and it said it did smh
B000CZ3UFA|5|Great bolts
B003ZE6NW2|4|great d-ring and solid. However, the red has been fading in the sun and I've only had these 4 months.
B00KTJ9RQ0|5|Awesome
B0015J6OK0|5|I really like the stoner glass with water repellent.  I use it on my shower doors. When used, I find there is no need to squeegee the door daily. The water repels for about a week of constant use.
B00AW62VCC|5|Perfect fit for my 2012 Charger hood liner.
B001PTCTL8|5|I didn't need all parts, but it got my pump working, again. Brought the pump for $5 at thrift store, so I'm happy.
B00HK589PQ|4|4 well earned start, but not quite 5...<br />Although the estimated delivery was about a month away, with no tracking info, the roller came in about a week. The box was a bit messed up but the roller was fine. It DOES come with the spacers for your acorn style lug-nuts like seen in a few pictures (like the Eastwood one too). They are on the handle, which the ends just unscrew to get to.<br /><br />I managed to roll &#34;double wall&#34; steel fenders including the spot welds, took about an hour a side, but it will do them.<br /><br />It would be 5 stars, but I'm giving it 4 because of the lack of adjustment. With my Mustangs suspension at almost full droop, I practically maxed out the range of motion. The one review guy seems to have found an alternative to that, just look at his pic.<br />If it had a few more adjustment holes for the arm, it would be perfect.<br /><br />In the end, rolled fenders, and no more cut tires! Cheaper then Eastwood, and probably just as good.
B00065ZIJ2|1|Terrible item, the metal welding broke after 2 weeks of use
B001449I5E|5|This was everything they said it was. It took me just 30 minutes to install. Way better than trying to splice. Great product very helpful video to go along with it. :)
B00GUF74HQ|5|Product works as indicated in write-up.  Easy to install.  Suggest watching product video on you tube for installation details that are not very clear in the printed instructions.
B00IE3Z4DS|5|Replace the cheap plastic one that came with your very expensive custom boat trailer. This one will bend, but it won't break off.
B009FUF6DM|4|They do what they should do and I'm happy with that.
B002308E9O|1|This puller expanded as it pushed against the crank and became stuck inside the rotor threads. Removing it resulted in the rotor threads being completely stripped. A new KLR rotor is $500. I recommend a flywheel puller made in the states.
B000QQZ9P4|5|I don't write many reviews, but I have to say this product exceeded my expectations.  The quality is outstanding.  Shipping was super fast and seller was very helpful as well.  Highly recommend.
B00DBEOFTE|5|Never heard of the brand and no reviews. I decided to give it a try because it was what i was looking for. I haven't used it for long or installed it yet but i tried it in another socket. The led seems to be bright. Doesn't look cheap and the reason why I gave 5 stars is because it fit very snug in the socket, just like the Phillips band. I haven't been able to find an off retail brand that does that. I also purchased the red leds so I'm going to wait until I receive those and try it out before i install the ambers in the front. 2015 wrx is a pain to install front side markers.
B00D7ICMY4|5|Great
B00EQMPE4A|1|Description said it would fit my 2004 Ram 1500 but didn't.
B000182EXC|3|I have two complaints about these ventshades: 1) they should extend a little further down the window--maybe a half inch or so more--so that you can roll the window down a bit more than just a crack and get more airflow into the car, especially if you're leaving the windows open to vent the car while it's parked in the sun, and 2) the description says these fit my 2005 Escape, and although they do indeed fit, the rear ventshades don't fully cover the window when you open it.  On any Escape 2001-2012, the rear passenger windows are not rectangular, they are slanted toward the back of the door; the ventshades don't cover this slanted part of the window, so when you crack the window open the interior is exposed to the elements.  It's not a total deal breaker, as it does cover most of the window, but if you're trying to leave the windows cracked open in the rain or in a parking lot, it could be a problem.  If these ventshades were really made for an Escape, they should have been designed to curve along the entire shape of the rear windows and not just the top of the door.  The front ones fit fine, though.  Overall, they look good on the car and they do the job somewhat, though they could definitely have been designed better.
B004Q83TGO|5|Did not work for either of my vehicles
B00DB8RB5U|1|It showed up in a package that was less than protective, a few of the grill bars were a bit tweeted. Not a big deal they bent back in shape fine. As I looked at it closer I noticed a obvious blemish where the powder coat did not adhere to the metal befor baking. Then looking at it held up I front of the truck I realized the advertised image was either a a different grill all to gether or some camera trickery. The return process was less than forthcoming as well.
B00AH16VQE|5|I bought this for my son.  He is a proud American, and loves to drive down the highway showing this pride.  He gets saluted by officer, military, and civilians alike.  He said, it is the best gift he was ever given.
B000S0J8IW|5|Look great come with everything you need to apply them. Spend the money well worth it.
B00J12P8S2|4|Lost the keys to the 4wheeler months ago and didn't have the cash to take to a service shop. This made my life easy with the convenience of two keys and new ignition. Does not come with instructions so I recommend looking up a how-to on youtube for instillation, but all in all super easy installation.
B001PYO0AQ|5|Works great
B00KY0B4FQ|5|Fit perfect and works just as well. I installed on my 99 maxima
B000QJG1HG|5|sounds nice not to loud not to quite love it
B005EYRQ0O|4|2002 subaru wrx, it fits perfect no cutting needed. Might need a bit of force to get it in there but hey! It does what it's suppose to do! Rather spend 60 then 200+ on a perrin when they both do the same thing just a different name
B002YKFA3G|4|Excellent product
B007Y86B5O|5|Great fit, easy install and fixed my charging issue with my battery.
B001MOZ2E2|5|Exact fit, easy replacement for passenger side switch on my 2005 Prius. Works perfectly again!
B004BCHHRC|1|Bought these headlights in April 2014 to replace hazed over original OEM lights.  They look great, but unfortunately they don't hold up.  After 14 months, the drivers side headlight is filling up with water after a rain and remains &#34;fogged&#34; showing moisture constantly.  I contacted the seller and was told that I'm past the 90 day replacement warranty and 1 year manufacturers warranty. I would skip these and find another manufacturer.
B001UFXZK6|5|pros:<br />-black material (not painted).<br />-very flexible (took a direct hit from a car and still intact).<br />-can be easily trimmed when going to 35s.
B00UXI766K|5|Not easy to put on
B00DDYNUC0|5|I turned it into a QI charging cubby on my 02 suburban!
B007WPBZUU|5|Coils work awesome car has plenty of power and price is very reasonable. You can't go wrong with Denso products
B00PCRY9G2|5|Fantastic kit, installed in my Buddy 50, broke it in the first 300 miles, runs strong now, i hit 55mph, 45-50 on hills
B00MTHPAN4|4|I know this adds nothing to the car but dang these are cool.
B002EO2AW6|5|Looks GR8 on the car. Better than the smaller sized logos & stands out
B006LJ99MO|5|Perfect fit for my sons highlander. Still waiting for him to pay me back. Would definitely order again if i owned a highlander. Very easy install. But i would not order for him again. He's a tall goofy looking kid with glasses, if he asks you to order something for him, don't do it.
B001U9IBIS|5|Awesome
B000W7K588|5|Neat bottle.  will make my brake fluid bleeding job easier.
B00MHTJXVE|4|Amazingly stout. Hammered the krap out of the shaft and puller even made a fulcrum and lever which I struck with a 3# hammer and still did not damage this tool. Eventually removed the bearing race from the axle of my Honda Recon axle shaft.
B003K5S4NW|5|works great no longer have to flick the wrist to get my windshield
B004W4ME22|5|Bad A$$ headlights.
B00XJ1E3LO|2|Very small to pricey if was an inch bigger than it would be worth the 5.50 disappointed but used it anyway.
B00HR26X6O|1|Rear license plate LEDs flicker
B00S3XMSY2|5|Easy to install and take off and on. Really strong grip on any steering wheel without sliding off while go the move. Best price as well!!
B00IYHRJNM|5|product is Ok
B00BSZARMM|5|Very convenient! Everything you need for an oil change and everything is OEM so you really can't go wrong.<br /><br />The only downside is that they forgot the washer. I messaged them and they said it's usually taped to the box, but mine was missing. I'll buy again, but early so that I can verify the washer made it.
B003ZZJVWA|5|Wasn't expecting such good quality for the price
B004LY41QK|5|Great paint
B00Q4R97NY|5|Awesome
B00FZJZFZG|5|Great tiny lights. I only have a couple of tips:<br />-attach the brackets to the truck first, THEN  attach the lights to the bracket. You will avoid any binding with metal bumper this way.<br />-use thread locking compound on any bolt. In the raptor's natural habitat, these will come loose if not secured properly. even the supplied locking washers did not stand the vibration.
B0038KE6G8|5|Just what we wanted
B005CQ691Q|1|the blinker light holder melted when i turned on running lights product is cheaply made junk.
B00KKQRADE|2|I didn't like the smell, wished that they offered other scents. I gave it to my fiancé and he likes it. Diffuser is fashionable and works well. Hopefully they will offer other all natural scents like Lavender and Citrus.
B00BSKYM82|1|It sucks, when it rained it turned cloudy. Still picking pieces off my land cruiser. Buy the sheet rolls or go have a pro do it for you. You really have to &#34;tent&#34; your vehicle. It gets everywhere
B00G9W95IQ|2|The listed weight of 1.6 ounces in not even close.  It is closer to 4 ounces. Not the ultralight bag like the product description / specifications state.  The bag seems well enough constructed, but the Amazon technical details are wrong.
B00MTHLPKG|3|Very hard to transfer
B00D3PDCZ4|5|Indeed it worked fine for my 2001 330i but it arrived without the seal ;-( Amazon gave me a discount for this mistake but still got a sour effect because I was in a hurry and I could not wait for a new seal and I ended re-using the old seal.
B00404ZDAO|5|Gift for my daughter in law that LOVESSSSSS PINK!!!
B004JBW4RS|5|Works perfectly no issues
B0040RG2QK|5|got it for my homo friend, fyi he is not gay
B007QBQW8K|5|Product was excellant,
B0030VIR2O|5|nice piece a little more solid than stock part.
B00BXO70UU|5|Great fit fast shipping
B0040DVL6U|4|Good quality product. The convex mirror gives me a wide field of view, but it takes some time to get used to how far objects are in the mirror. Everything in the mirror looks brighter and sharper than the factory mirror, but the flip up or down for night driving to reduce glare no longer works. It adds to the overall weight on the mirror mount so vibrations are exaggerated. But even with all these drawbacks, i still like the product because of the dramatically increased field of view.
B00407TTEW|5|Perfect match! As the can says
B000O0E8B8|5|Fits and looks great on my 2012 heritage. Nice thing is I can put the passenger seat on right over to of the bib to better protect the paint finish on the fender.
B00GSAUHB8|3|it has good quality but is too small to fit my Camry LE 2012
B0054YCW62|5|What a tangled mess!<br />But once I got it untangled, it was a great cargo net. Fits my full size pickup nicely.<br />Also, you will NEVER run out of hooks!
B00SAGB83Y|5|Work very well but  directions are almost completely useless so can be confusing to set up
B001JT5OPC|1|Piece of crap!!!!!!!!broke so easy from my own use!!!!
B00FO5R25W|1|All the pieces were not inclued with the order
B00AIJY2ZM|1|Bulb burnt out after 2 weeks of use!
B0094MF3F2|5|Cool stickies!
B001DRL6NO|5|great
B00KQPOSQ6|5|My husband loves this for our camper. It's easy to wash off & helps us from tracking in too much dirt.
B00412YT8W|5|works perfectly
B000C19DGY|5|Easy to install, and works great!
B00PWIK3WK|5|Yes! It did fit my dodge neon 2000 without any problems
B000B8JUNY|5|So far so good.  Replaced my '99 Civic cap as it malfunctioned somehow, requiring an act of congress and/or executive order to unscrew.  This one has worked fine thus far.
B00E9IEX2K|2|Cheap lights the rubber was not even glued on the clip part didn't want to hold in place made very chinsy
B004TCZYHO|5|It was a good fit and it looks sleek. It could be a bit brighter during the day but it does the job.
B00ULQLR46|5|Promt s/h<br />Great fit.
B00SSKUHAC|4|Bought for my 2015 Tundra. Fit perfectly. Great way to create decent storage for the large center console.
B000VUE9RE|5|OEM, perfect fit. LED is nice and bright, clean connectors. Fixed all my issues of bulbs randomly turning off. The connector was melted on the old one.
B004AGGHHA|5|OE fit and quality
B00U6G8ICA|4|Works great for the price.  Hard to say how long it will last - cheap Chinese steel, but it will do the job.
B001DRHMMI|5|Simple install, works as advertised. Brilliant offer. Garage wanted to charge me a fortune for it.
B00K7938O4|5|Love them!
B004YTWFTW|5|I had a BAD accident last August.  The nurse at the operating room was riding with us that day.  A great way to say thank you,
B00JSJMUBQ|4|Perfect in my honda civic 2012
B003ZOH63W|5|good product, good price
B00063XDP0|5|AAA+++ Buying experience!!!
B00KWH0FPG|4|I love it save me a lot
B00P8BRET6|4|As advertised. Arrived in perfect shape and is now adorning the back window of my truck.
B002P8DFXO|1|it did not fit, on the website it said it was for a 2000 ,  on the box it came in a 2004-5  don't quite remember now but a different year.<br />had to eat the shipping charges to return.
B004IYQUTY|3|it work ok no problems
B00DDV3LAE|5|Fast delivery, great price!
B0085XH58O|5|great badge fast ship
B00837D9C8|5|Fit perfect and covered up every bit of cracked dash.
B00W60I00O|5|100%
B002IZDM1Y|1|Don't work
B00ELHTC1G|5|Love the Royal !!!
B00G3JVS8A|5|I ordered this for my husband. He loves it. Summers are hot in Alabama, he no longer drives around to meetings wearing a  hot suit coat / sport coat.  Easy to fix to the head rest of his car,  he uses it every day.
B000VSFNQW|4|Great product!!!  Would have been 5 stars if original product sent was correct.  Originally received incorrect parts and had to return and took approximately 2 months to get what I ordered.  1 month to get the defective and another month to get the right parts.  Please note that image of product differs depending on vehicle.  I was a bit disappointed to find out my vehicles bar was curved outwards instead of pictured strait but in the end I still really like it.
B00IXDGKTG|5|beautiful on my bike...love them!
B00LIAJJZS|5|Nice fit,good quality
B00LUZTTL0|5|They work perfect for the job. Arrived on time. Good packing. I used with a R410A refrigerant, and get me the job done perfect. Nothing to complain.<br />Good product. Thks,
B00R68R368|2|despite being properly described, this battery is too large to fit the chassis that BMW made for the battery. It is too deep and too tall. Because it is difficult to return batteries I have McGuivered it into place. Pityt, because the battery itself is working great and the little trickle chrager will probably keep it working for years.
B00EKN2P60|4|Put them in our sailboat and they produce a warm natural light unlike some LED's. The only reason for 4 stars was that a couple bulbs didn't work in a certain fixture so I had to try different lights in different fixtures to get them to work. I little annoying but nothing big.
B0074UZX9M|5|Excellent fit for my Audi Q5
B000MWJYUS|2|Does not fit with any tire size larger than factory.
B006LJBMCY|1|Despite the glowing reviews of this product as a drop in replacement, the unit i received did not work properly. The window would wind down and would not be able to come up again. After many frustrating hours of trouble shooting (everything seemed to work as it should but the anti trap function would kick in when trying to close the window from a fully open position.), realised that the window holder was twisting against the roller housing when in the full open position and causing the window to trap itself in the guide rails.Pushing it from below while pressing the up button worked to regain function  as the nudge was enough to release the bind. Returned this for the OEM part (that cost 50$ more) and the OEM part fit perfectly and works perfectly. I may have gotten a lemon of a part.. but based on the description that it was supposed to be an improvement over the OEM part... I think not.
B00YTZ9EEK|1|Worst thing ever piece of s*** would not recommend buying it I regret it.
B00Y1OC9KA|5|Fits like a glove
B00LW6JO5I|5|Perfect fit for 6.5 diesel,easy install...
B000CLJTKE|5|I am very satisfied with this pad. It was my first time installing brake pads and I followed the instructions on youtube. This feels much better than the ones Midas put on my older car before. It has been about 4 months and so far it is very good.
B00130L5AA|1|Singular product. NOT a pack of 12--maybe came from a pack of 12. I ordered 12, yet received 1 -- Individual.
B002LGSI2I|4|Everything was great. Went together without a problem.
B000ALJ4MY|1|This has got to be the absolute worst product I've ever purchased; what a waste of time and money. If I could rate it a &#34;0&#34; or lower I would.<br />I thought I'd give it a try to on a small &#34;bullseye&#34; in my windshield --- what a waste. I'm an experienced Mechanical Engineer with 25-year career, so, yes, I do understand the product and concept as well as know how to follow the instructions. Just to make sure I did everything absolutely correct, I watched the online video and followed the instruction/procedure exactly. During the &#34;curing&#34; phase, I left vehicle out in a cloudless, sunny day with temperatures near 95 DegF (Houston). ... it did absolutely nothing. Hole was still there, nothing filled-in, nothing cured. I'm wondering how to get my money back, but for $20+ is it really worth my time? I'm sure that is exactly what this manufacturer is hoping for---that people won't take the time to try to get their money back on this scam product.
B001GG6DAS|1|Horrible purchase!  I was led to believe I was ordering purple sticky horseshoes - instead got very bad color - not at all what I ordered!
B007QBU1LE|1|Part did not fit my truck though Amazon web site confirmed it would.....
B0088V424S|5|Arrived quickly, looks great.
B006WQRCHA|3|I was in need of &#34;another&#34; hub and bearing for my 2006 Ford Explorer. My Explorer has 117,xxx miles.  I had a reputable company do one side  a couple years ago at a cost of around $650.00. Being on a fixed income I decided to do it myself so I could save a few dollars and I am a basic mechanic so it was a job I could handle. I shopped the local auto parts stores and most of them wanted anywhere between $160 and $375 for just the part. I decided to go online and find he part. I found Detroit Axel offered the hub/bearing on Amazon. I remembered Detroit Axel from many years ago as being a GREAT Company with a reputation for GREAT auto parts. Little did I know that Detroit Axel is NOT the Detroit Axel from the past. DETROIT AXEL is a company in China using the name of a very reputable company once in AMERICA. I was very let down to see &#34;Made in China&#34; on the box that the hub/bearing were in. I have been very disappointed in products made in China. Most everything is of a lesser quality than those made in America. Although the fit was great and it looks like it &#34;should&#34; I'm very skeptical on the life of the bearing.  Buyer beware, made in China not the Detroit we all know.
B009OFC0OQ|5|I like it
B010WE6NOK|5|Perfect fit ! After stripping one of my OE screws that attach my top and I was looking for a suitable replacement.  These are great and there is also no need for tools for removing them anymore you can tighten them down by hand with ease and there is no awkward positioning of tools anymore!
B000CO869Q|4|Thanks...
B000B6DG4U|5|Worked great great product
B005HVG4GQ|5|Everything was just the way it said. No problems thanks. Great item
B000NW7H38|5|Well made and will last a lifetime.
B009B1APA4|5|excellent!
B00NVPA862|5|Fast shipping! Just take your time putting on and looks great!
B00JRYHG70|5|This was the perfect solution to a cable that frayed and the worry about turning with a cable connected. Buy the 6' length or longer.
B000CSGWZC|5|Excellent plugs. Noticeable improvement in performance and gas mileage.
B008032N2W|5|Fixed my 1999 pathfinder now it's dependable again.
B00BK85FAQ|4|I like this a lot.  It fits perfectly and weather tech floor mats.  The only issue is the metal mounting bracket and clip on the passenger side tends to squeak when you drive over bumps.  Otherwise i would totally recommend this.
B001KXN3YQ|3|Slowed leak a bit, no miracle cure tho, just Thick oil.
B00YML13OU|3|We have only used the magnets a couple of times and the magnet edges seem to be loosing strength.  It is not overly hot where we live, so I am not sure why this is happening.
B008JORKP2|4|I sit out around 9:00 in the evening and it's awesome and gives just the right heat.
B005LDBU0U|4|This item did not work as well as I expected.  My first long ride with it did not relieve any pressure on my tailbone.  I plan to use it again and hopefully it will meet my expectations.  If it does better I will update my review.
B00DWKYS3K|5|looks good
B003A8D6YG|3|Very sticky. Holds anything, but doesn't leave a residue on that object. If you are the type of person that keeps things on the dash of their car, then this might be for you. It does attract dirt, fuzz, and finger prints. When this happens I just wash it with soapy water and let dry. It is as good as new. On very hot days, it it difficult to remove everyday items from its surface.
B000C9PHTS|3|Threads were messed up which took a ton of time and stress cleaning / dressing so they would not strip.
B007XE5LTG|4|I had never used an OBDII scanner before, but decided to get one when a co-worker pulled his out of his car and plugged it into my van to see what was wrong when I had some mis-firing going on.  I purchased both this wired unit and a wireless unit, the ieGeek® WIFI Wireless OBD2 Auto Scanner Adapter Scan Tool for iPhone iPad iPod.  Both work well, but the wireless version has the added benefit of being able to monitor engine functions LIVE, so if something intermittent is going on, you have a better chance to spot it if it is not leaving the MIL codes.  The Autel AL519 will display live sensor data as well, but there is a cable in the way and I already have a nice dashboard mount for my iPhone.  To make the ieGeek WiFi Wireless work, I purchased a $5.95 app at the iTunes App Store, so the real price of the wireless model is about $35.<br /><br />Since I am new to this OBDII scanner stuff, the Autel AL519 might have important features I have not tried yet that make it a better overall choice, but for the amateur like me, I think the wireless devices make more sense.  I also purchased a BlueDriver ODBII wireless scanner, but it was more expensive and even though it came with a free iPhone and Android app, doesn't seem any better than the ieGeek version.  The BlueDriver is more compact and easier to leave plugged in all the time, but for the price difference you really need those features to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />I plan to leave one device in each of our families 3 cars, so they are readily available when needed.
B009PDC4SY|2|Although it was the right remote, it was it was pretty knicked up on the outside, some buttons were sticking and it wouldn't work at all because the battery seemed like it was dead. I had to change the battery immediately to get it to work and even program it. I had to clean it all up. Other then all that it's working now .
B000ONZXPK|4|Good oil but difficult to get into differential due to GM's engineering...adding a pump, while tedious, saved a spill
B009Q0Z5D2|5|Perfect fit. I'm a real customer who was worried it wouldn't fit, would look different, or install would be hard. Happy on all counts
B002MRFD60|5|Great fit and protection of the interior carpet and floor board area also extends far enough under seats to protect for splashes and spills!
B00BTLEHSK|4|They are really nice...only thing with the fitting for the back seat of the Sequioa was it was a bit loose...otherwise we would buy again even have others asking where we made the purchase...the price was reasonable as well
B00Q3CM4S0|4|Wife loved them!
B000NJ4D5G|1|Not long enough.
B00029WRKA|5|They do the job intended and they hold tightly to my truck mirrors. Because of the design of my 2005 Toyota Tundra passenger side mirror, this mirror didn't help on that side. The body of the truck mirror extends from the door at about 45 degrees so this mirror doesn't add much more visibility. This is no fault of this universal mirror.  That's why I rated it a &#34;5&#34;.
B00DZUE05I|5|Got it on time, and was what I expected
B00NXMBYTS|2|It breaks every time you pull it ober a three ft. section.  Way to long shipping because it came from china.  Want buy anything again that far away.
B000CP0G1G|3|Worked fine,  wish they offered a complete set Qty 4.
B00C8E8LGQ|5|Great product! Worked great on my van. It is made very strong and will last much longer than the rest of my van will I'm sure. I had no problems installing this.
B005JCS8KS|5|Product came very quickly in mail. While putting it on my wife's van i found that the tensioner was very tight!! Took 2 of us to loosen while the other slipped the belt on. Other than that no issues so far!!
B000B7PHW8|5|Worked perfectly thank you.
B000EQPAS2|5|2006 Saturn direct fit
B00H04WOV2|2|way dimmer than expected. Using as a replacement bulb in a &#34;littlelite&#34; not enough light.
B00BMLVLOK|3|Came with all but one main gasket....was kind of disappointed when I rebuilt the exhaust
B00B51XWTO|5|Very happy
B008RBAB2G|5|good product good service
B002T76TXO|5|Sound great on my GL1800
B004U00H8G|5|AMAZING
B000FKIURK|5|Literally  just plug these into my 2003 Wrangler and wow what a difference over stock lights.
B00E9KL1FK|1|Did not realize it had California on it . Should be able to pick state or it should be blank . BON JOVI has noting to do with California .
B00KZ2YBRG|4|Great LED. Maybe a bit too bright for some purposes.
B0015RYAHG|5|Great for my frontier
B004I0VCLO|5|Fits perfectly
B00GVOCWY6|2|The red worked fine and was the right color. The clear wouldn't hardly come out. The clear was very very thick and it wasn't a pen, it was a dry marker.
B00NWT8ZPI|5|Definetly did the trick on my 05 Ford F-150. Way cheaper than the factory and do the same job.
B009OBW23O|5|Works very easy  it's looks more clear then white when applied. But it goes on very easy and comes off easy. I would recommend this to anyone<br />Who owns a white car.
B0009V4G8W|3|Not as heavy as other bras I've  used but still ok for the price
B007ZRZQ8C|5|It was perfectly amazing
B0009PSA4O|5|great mirrior
B00RA48SG2|5|Perfect.  Exactly what I needed for the sides of my motorcycle.
B00Q8FU79U|5|Product was exactly as described.  I actually used it for a 5.3 swap in a 1991 C1500.  Worked out great.
B000CQ6IYO|5|Excellent....exactly what was advertised and what I expected
B000FIY08U|5|Vers good no problemes with
B00I30B5NU|5|Works great just like a factory pump !
B00HVHMXS2|5|great product
B003VLBPJA|5|Worked great
B00P2SYBJG|5|Exactly as expected.
B000BQR100|3|my steering still get hot, vehicle not feeling cool at all
B00CPKV8JU|5|Took a trip this summer to the Tail of the Dragon. My girlfriend and I rode there from Houston, TX, with a side trip to Lake Cumberland KY. 10 days, over 2,300 miles on a 750 Shadow Spirit. The best decision I've ever made was to buy her a Butty Buddy seat before taking the trip. I also took some memory foam and made a cushion to fit the seat. The combination worked like a charm. Not one complaint about a sore butt!  If you have a bike with a postage stamp sized back seat, like I do, I highly recommend this product.  I also recommend a trip to the Dragon/Smoky Mountain Area! Beautiful scenery and great roads everywhere you go!
B00FFAX2A0|4|Excellent service. Went in the same opening no problems
B00BLZBTH6|5|Exactly what I needed
B00144D09O|5|It worked perfectly on my 89sea ray and the price was great. Thank You!!!
B007CLM120|5|Lights work great and are really bright.
B00IGZQT38|4|Perfect fit as it should be, nice thick quality rubber protects the floors well.  The back ones slide around a bit so sometimes they get pushed forward under the seats somewhat.  Overall pretty nice mats though
B009XQKCQY|5|Great value...waterproof too!
B00HJAQP7G|5|Looks great,easy to install and much cheaper than OEM
B000NJ39E2|5|Does what it is suppose to do. Nothing more.
B00O3ODSUI|5|Arrived right on time and exactly the color I wanted!
B0040CX3B2|5|Worked great, Just as advertised.
B00860JCJ6|5|Perfect fit, quality item.  Extra capacity is certainly a benefit.
B000C5YD4M|5|Fits and works like OEM. Cleared my bank 1 (front) sensor heater error.
B0092P19T0|5|Works great!
B00EN4MV9M|5|Great quality vinyl and its withstanding Arizona heat pretty well!
B00BTLEJAQ|5|Exactly what I wanted. Snug fit and I had to work around a  few issues since my back seat (bench seat) does not move but after I got the covers on they look nice and were very affordable. The material is excellent. Worth twice the price.
B000FPYW4K|5|Removed my cam and ream main seals without fuss. Much safer that with screwdrivers.
B00RDYOFD4|5|These are great frames. Dressed up my Caddy beautifully. And they were more reasonable pricewise than going through Cadillac
B0028PJ10K|5|Looking forward to using our own.  Friends loaned us theirs to use.
B00KANYRS8|5|Sturdy easy to peal off sticker.  Bought it for my DYI emergency kit and is the perfect size for my box.  Very good quality.  Took longer than expected to receive.
B00OLVG4GI|5|great
B009LREACM|5|Great stuff works on all my foam aircraft
B004SZVOJO|5|Very pleased with this. I'm not sure how it will hold up to someone that knows it's in there. But a smash and grabber has no chance. Easy to install. Less than 5 minutes, and fits perfectly. I have already recomended this product. If I sell this truck, I will buy another for my next truck.
B00R1NWR0K|5|Great product & fast shipping
B00DSD5DI0|5|Now all will know that I too like LOG via car, laptop, or any other adhesive surface. Wowie!
B000C9DPDS|5|2004 Yukon, parts fit and adjusted fine, better than the factory original which were not installed correctly.  You go Mexico or Wisconsin.
B00T6J2TGE|5|Great looking addition to my Harley would recommend to other Harley owners...
B002KS6AS6|5|Worked perfect for taking apart my  Thermador stove. Seems to be well made. No complaints here.
B001CEXR9E|3|Great center console for the money for my 1993 jeep wrangler yj. The spice color matches really well also. It is true that it is too wide but it does fit non the less. Moving the passenger seat up and down is kind of a pain because the seat belt always gets stuck.<br /><br />I give three stars because 2 of the nuts were missing, and the nuts that came with it were standard and the bolts metric. Also the front most anchor bolt was too long so I pretty much had to buy all new hardware.<br /><br />The locking mechanism worked well but I modified it and put a combination cam lock in so I don't need an extra key. The lock is called a Combi Cam
B000AMOEGY|4|4 stars
B00OJY7RPO|5|Beautiful picture of my love Sting on the air freshener. It's big and very clear. Made of good material I can see it lasting a long time. Well worth the money.
B00473W5V8|5|works great
B00M9O8R4Q|5|Fit in a 2003 Audi A4 5 speed.  Definitely noticed the difference from the worn out stock snub mount.  Feels very smooth during shifts and acceleration.
B000N37D7W|1|Don't buy these plastic devices unless you want to struggle for an hour to get the fuel lines apart.  I learnt the hard way with the fuel lines on my suburban. The part that inserts into the coupling is too short and too soft to work. I wonder which genius thought of making these plastic to save a few bucks. Get the metal ones that look like scissors.  The metal ones work in seconds.
B00HEVF34Q|5|Awesome quality and great price!!!
B001R4RMUY|1|This bearing failed after 3 months. Only about 4000 miles on it.....very disappointed.
B0031HEIDY|5|Nice upgrade to the standard bulbs that were in the car originally.
B0013FSLJS|5|part was just what I needed
B002FY6DF0|5|the fit was perfect and it came with the lite took me 30 min to install cause im a newbe lol but hade np with it and all the plug fit right on ty cant beet the price
B004VSE9FE|3|Aroma is awesome. I purchased the Creamy Vanilla. Unfortunately, unless you are using in quick mass quantities, I would recommend the individually wrapped wafers. These quickly dry out in the container despite me taking special care of quickly opening and closing the lid and storing in an airtight Ziploc bag.
B00RRXP8SW|5|Love these. Am on my second pair and they take a beating (rather than my body) when riding moto. I'm a 150-lb woman about 5'8&#34; and wear a medium. Perfect fit.
B007QXQKNA|5|Had them for about two months. Not a problem yet, easy to install. Looks so much better than oem and extremely cheap.
B00BBZXL5E|5|DOES JUST WHAT ITS SUPPOSED TO DO.  SLOWES ENGINE WHEN UP TO PRESSURE, WHEN PRESSURE DROPS DOWN IT SPEEDS ENGINE UP.
B000TYOQVQ|5|Works well. Fits great.
B0002SR4Q8|5|unscrewing the oil filter by hand is frustrating on my evo x.  it's located right underneath the engine in a spot that is too tight, and a position that is very uncomfortable, to grab with both hands.  I would use rubber surfaced gloves and even then it took me awhile to get it off.  this tool does it in seconds while giving you another reason to use a socket wrench and takes away the dread of fighting to torque it off by hand.  highly recommend for evo x or 4b11 owners
B0000AY3X8|5|Been using these for years, and nothing compares. I've tried the rest, and my oldest Absorber ( Now almost 20 years old and handed down at that) will still mop the floor with them (pun intended). We take them camping, as they're great towels for the beach or boat, since they only require a quick rinse out before storage. No more line drying your towels all night. Great for cars, housework, and especially for pulling spills out of carpets. With kids around, one of these has single handedly saved my carpet.
B000K2PTD6|3|This wiring harness also fits Lexus 2004-2006 RX330 with Tow Package option installed. (see photos)
B00EUIDPLO|5|Great-looking metal license plate frame.
B006MX81FA|1|Product is good quality but does not fit my vehicle seats. The online information I entered confirmed it would fit but this is not the case
B006VOSH5O|4|Easy to install, louder than the stock with deep sound, especially during acceleration. Sticker was on pretty good and hard to remove so I just burned it off going down the highway at 75....probably my only complaint about the muffler
B000E4PCFA|5|Item arrived as expected. Swift installation, works good.
B00AFV7DHW|4|Perfect fit for my 2014 Toyota Tundra. They even look good on the truck, you can't tell they are snap ons. As one reviewer did state... The mirrors do vibrate a bit. I noticed even with my radio on low they vibrate to the speakers by the doors.
B00BU618V8|4|I bought this helmet to use for my first ever open track day at the Streets of Willow.  I don't know how much I will actually track my car so I wanted to start with something that wasn't crazy expensive.  The helmet seems to be of good quality.  I'm by no means an expert in this field but it looks and feels solid to me.  I wore it through a few sessions in 100 degree weather and it wasn't too bad.  It was 100 degrees in the desert so of course I sweat a bit but I never felt that the helmet made my head burn up.<br />I gave the helmet 4 stars because of its sizing problem.  I didn't know what size to order and I don't normally wear caps or hats so I went to the Zamp website to figure it out.  I measured the circumference of my head based on their directions and their chart told me I should be a medium.  Unfortunately that was too tight.  I had to return it and had to pay for return shipping.  I'm very happy now with the Large size.  There is one other review that mentioned that the sizing might run a bit small and I guess I should have listened.  If you measure your head and you're on the border  between two sizes I would recommend going for the larger size.  I now use the helmet to go to K1 Speed indoor karting so I guess the helmet is more useful than I originally thought!
B00496OHHI|5|fits perfectly and excellent quality .. MADE IN MEXICO
B000C59V58|5|love moog products and very strong products would definatly buy again if needed
B002M3FZNA|5|Works great on my RV. No or one doing duo a tires in back.
B002E22CUS|5|its a gasket and it seals, not much can be said about this
B000CPI5Z0|3|I trust red line but no, I couldn't tell or see a difference. I assume everything is clean. I have 285,000 miles but like I said, if any product would've worked, my money is still on this one.
B00CTUSEMU|5|Used for fluid exchange in my 2008 Prius. Since it's toyota is a replacement and should work fine, BUT you should check the dealers price, it may be cheaper. My dealer was.
B000C57VYG|5|love moog products and very strong products would definatly buy again if needed
B003CEN0U8|1|This was a waste of money. I bought this to use on my road bike, only to find similar reports in the other reviews. The presta valve input has some sort of sizing problem. It doesn't seem as though the valve can be fully inserted into the gauge. As a result, I get pressure readings (if I get them at all) in the 15-20 PSI range -- obviously not correct for a road bike. Lesson learned...read other reviews more thoroughly next time!
B000BGHYDO|5|This will work great for my holding tank. Plenty of water power to rinse the tank after emptying into my portable tank. With this I will not use as much water as I would normally to empty my main tank.
B00TDJDCZ4|5|Super bright and great lights, I thought we needed 4 total lights on the golf cart... he said no, 2 was enough... guess what he was right!
B00TPY559S|5|FAST SHIPMENT; ITEM AS DESCRIBED. AAA
B009MAT4S8|1|I returned this item because I thought it was the hard firm kind that folds up.  This one was flimsy much like the kind you can buy in the store really cheap.
B00YB5GAEA|5|Light is great but impossible to mount on my recumbent rack.<br />I am disabled and have to ride the recumbent trike.<br />Your light only mounts to a bar like the bar under the seat of a normal bike.<br />I cannot find any way to mount your light on the rack.<br />Really sad situation since I ride my trike a lot at night.
B008QUG3H0|2|I gave it a rating of 2 stars because there was not clear instructions on how to install these covers.<br />The insert had a number to call and there only suggestion was to send me 2 small bungie cords.<br />After much trial and error, I finally got them on and they are nice seat covers.
B008XNRENW|3|I had mix feelings when going to buy this. I loved the smell of my little ozium container I kept in my car. But hated the spray bottle. So I bought these and decided to give it a try. 1st off - for some reason I assumed they were for your car vents. They're not - they have sticky pads. So far it doesn't look like it's hard to remove. It helps the smell in my car for the most part. I'm a smoker and hate the smell of stale ciggarettes. This sort of helps. And not by masking it either. Really gets rid of it. But sort of died out soon. Can still smell it but it's a little difficult after 2 weeks. Then again, it's summer so the heat may have something to do with it. I would say these little things would be great for someone who isn't a smoker, or has bad smells in their car but just wants it to smell clean.
B00JJRBPMW|5|Thanks
B00EZPBRCG|1|TO DAMN SMALL screw to small very hard to install
B00LG07MZE|5|Arrived perfectly in two days. Fits my 2500 Chev Silverado to a T.<br /><br />The sunshade keeps my truck cool and blocks UV rays completely.<br /><br />Great experience all around.
B00S4HFNXK|5|The Extreme Max Fenders are a square contoured design which works well for small vessels such a small boat or Jet Ski. The bend in the fender wraps both the upper and lower section of the side of the boat. This is a good value pack because it contains two fenders as well as the fender lines. Fender lines are around $5 a piece just for them.<br /><br />We have a large boat that we have the big round fenders for but we also have a Jon boat for fishing and these work better for it. They also take up less room when not in use. With the square design, they take up little storage.
B00VYB3JJ8|2|It was advertised as fitting the Prius steering wheel and it didn't fit; too big.
B002E39XXG|1|Very bad product it fails with leak by the side in the middle. I installed it on May this year (2015) and yesterday (august, 03, 2015) fails with several tiny leaks on the side near the level reference, very bad product.
B004HAEFS2|5|Great lights, better deal. Worked perfect on a trailer I repainted. Now it's safer, legal, and looks good.
B00P73KWE4|4|Delivery was 1 day early which was great. I thought it would be a little thicker metal. Works for my chain saw and other hunt club tools. Well see how tough it is come deer season. If it'll hold up to a deer I'll change my rating to 5 stars.
B000AMBHGE|5|Quick mailing, installed quickly and works great - thanks!
B000BUQODG|5|These are great and will protect your hatches from sun damage and allow you to keep them open during rain. The install was easy and straight forward. Make sure you position it correctly and it will work as advertised - you cannot open the hatch 100%, but more than enough for air movement.<br /><br />I am ordering one more for my third hatch.
B005FM0SCI|5|Fit good nice profuct
B005N6Z3VW|5|For a buddy
B001O11GXO|5|Very happy that I decided to change my own brake pads and save a few hundred dollars. These pads are high quality and I'm very pleased with their stopping power.
B0014GDGPU|5|Jerry on.

B00O2DE3LS|1|Did absolutely nothing. Waste of time and money
B007V2CTKO|5|Works great on my 2010 TL and keeps my car much cooler while it bakes in the TX sun while I'm stuck inside the office all day.
B00Q8G3PUW|5|good fit
B003BYFT9O|4|I wish it would have a possibility to fasten it with a seat belt.  It follows the shape of the seat cushion pretty well, but sits pretty far away from the back rest.  I don't believe it will stay i place when I would have to make an emergency breaking.  I plan to modify it to be able to belt it down.<br /><br />The product quality is pretty good and meets my expectations.  it would be almost perfect if it would come in more colors and could be belted down.
B00DBHDIAI|4|worked as designed
B000BZIM54|5|Ansolute top quality starter. 100% new Bosch starter, and as of this writing it's considerably lower priced on Amazon than the rebuilt Bosch starter. Odd. Works perfectly, very strong! Very difficult install on my vehicle. I was able to replace entirely from the top, contrary to some DIY articles. Very tight working conditions, but possible. Remove all the covers on top at firewall and you can just see the 2 bolts. Use a 3/8 ratcheting box end wrench for best results. Then you can move starter around to detach the wiring and maneuver up and out. I would not recommend taking on this task if you lack mechanical experience.
B000C34KT2|5|Very quite and my problem with the belt noise is resolved
B000F19XE8|1|None of the vent holes line up. It fits the dash though.
B004RCUVFQ|5|Installed and works good
B0077RM6D8|5|Bought this set of bars for my 2012 Vw Jetta SportWagon. They fit and worked like a dream.<br />The craftsmanship was also really good, you couldn't notice that they were not a name brand.<br />I used them with a cargo rack too, and also would good.

B000KITSMI|1|DID NOT WORK AT ALL TOTAL WAIST ON THIS ONE  I WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE IT ONE STAR  BAD BAD  CHOICE  WAS TO BE USED ON  FORD RANGER,  THIS SYSTEM DOES NOT USE A SCHRADER VALVE  BUT A RUBBER BALL VALVE SO IT DIDN'T WORK,

B00FDQPCR2|4|very nice for the money
B00X04JRMU|5|I have to say I was a little skeptical about the product at first in spite of all the rave reviews. I have been detailing my cars for over 40 years and tried a lot of fine products, Wash Wax All really rates with the best of them. It's an excellent product to maintain a clean, protected paint surface for your vehicle whether you decide to use it between conventional hose and bucket  washes or as your primary method. It really is as easy to use as described. Best to start with a somewhat cleaner surface with a simple dusting or damp wipe down. Afterwards, a simple application of Wash Wax All and a no-effort wipe off, your car will gleam with a smooth and slick finish. Ive done the first application and a followup a week later, and it couldnt be easier. 20 mins or so from start to finish and not a drop of water runoff.. particularly effective in drought-hit California. The seller Aero Cosmetic was awesome as well. Received my order 3-5 days earlier than quoted. Through no fault of the seller, some of the product leaked in the packaging causing all the contents to arrive damp. USPS did retape but did not replace the box itself. I reported the incident to the seller and was promptly offerred an additional 16oz bottle for my troubles. If there was ever to be a true 5-star seller, this is that seller. Buy with confidence - a great product and outstanding customer service.<br />*********UPDATE*********<br />A year and a half after my first purchase, I've followed with 2 additional orders since. I've shared with family and friends and all have been truly amazed with the results I've shown them. They are always impressed with the silky smooth finish that is unmatched by other products. WashWaxAll is still the easiest product to use with really great results. You can buy this product with confidence. Thanks again to Aero Cosmetics for a great product and superior customer service.
B00651CLCS|1|Terrible product. I literally could not tune in a single station after installing this antenna.
B0093NAAY6|5|Easy to install in my 2007 Odyssey.  In fact my 13 year old did the job for me.  I simply checked his work.  Very easy to install.
B003COTFS4|5|Worked better than ward which
B0093AA5KI|5|Would highly recommend. With the tinted windows on the sides and rear, no sunrays escape into the Challlenger to do any damage. Fits so well the visors are not needed to keep sunshade in place
B00T5G53ZM|5|Good item
B00SBZRELY|5|This is the cleanest way to transfer gas I have ever seen. It shuts off automatically when the receiving tank is almost completely full. The only question I have is when the plastic of the filler hose becomes brittle and starts to breakdown, is there a replacement you can buy or do you have to replace the whole unit. It would become a bit pricey if every couple of years you had to buy a new unit. Otherwise it was money well spent to have this unit to transfer gas from the storage container to all my gas powered equipment. I recommend this product highly.
B00JW1VY1M|5|perfect replacement for the factory cupholders
B00I5HRFYY|5|I use it to lift up front of mower to clean under the deck.
B001QV83G0|5|Looks great arrived quick, gotta love Prime!
B00ROU39Y8|5|I purchased these as a replacement for my fathers 2001 Audi A4 1.8 turbo and i must say i am very pleased. they look great and are good OEM quality. i would HIGHLY recommend these to anyone looking for good wheel cap replacements and at a very great price. i would purchase these again for sure.
B005R27ZK4|1|They were nice but extremely huge for the my 1994 Jeep Wrangler seats
B0015YC0PI|5|It fits and does the job
B00Y3YAM98|5|I like the 5&#34; monitor 1080  what's what I'm Look for for my truck
B0066IUPH8|5|As expected.
B00UNK30SQ|5|Works fine. Very handy for storing things for our little one.
B000CD8HQY|2|replaced oem Subaru wiper blades easily within 5 minutes on the first one and 2 minutes on the second. I use Rainex additive in our washer fluid. Many time I don't need the wipers on at high speed, but when I do need the wipers, these clear them completely without streaking or noise. Love em.  Went quickly from a 5 to a 2 star after 6 months of use. The extreme end of the wiper started to bend and twist making considerable noise and worry for the user. To its credit, the wiper still functioned by clearing the heavy rain but it looks and sounds like it is about to fail completely. This appears to be a product or design flaw. No wear or breakage is apparent. Can't wait for mfgr. replacement, so will source another solution. TB.
B0002JN2EU|5|Great product, really protects your two and four cycle engines as well as Cars and trucks.
B0091KCH6U|5|They work very well. Used them on my '04 Grand Prix.
B004HEUJ3I|4|plugs into a DIN power socket to power my tire pump that has a cigarette lighter plug.
B00A8NTOZQ|5|I feel like it's easier to find my car among everyone who has the same car and it adds character because I'm not the type of person to stick stickers all over my car.
B003X9TLUK|4|works great
B00QL6PIZ4|1|After receiving this product I had to rebuild it front to back it completely fell apart when I tried to plug the USB in it

B0027ERAY6|5|just like the factory one that came with the car.

B0049ZB7FO|5|pricey but good product
B0041DX8JW|1|Good luck with the motor assembly on these.  Mine died after a couple days.   *Installation Hint* Make sure you have the metal window clamp sleeve (the part that clamps onto the glass)  in Exactly the same location as the old one was clamped.
B000C9DDEO|5|Great part, great price.
B00AO6I1ZG|5|Great helmet
B005H4YJWO|5|Perfect match!
B00A1A6PT4|4|Part worked perfectly!
B0006IX80K|5|Perfect fit,came as scheduled and the price was right.
B00USC2CEW|5|I was going to use this light on my front bumper on my Polaris RZR. It shined back of the polished aluminum bumper and made it hard to see. I ended up mounting it on my sons Honda 4 Trax. He loves how much light it puts of and how it helps him see so much more out on night rides. I am looking at buying a second one for back up lighting on the RZR. We have been out in dry and rainy conditions. In the mud and this light has held up well. Great light for the price.
B000C9ULJ4|5|Good stuff
B004HYRI28|5|Very pleased.  The installation was easily completed by myself.  The fit is very good and secure.  It is a much better look than the caps I replaced.
B0051OKBC2|5|Great product
B00551DZ3S|2|It's ok,  it works
B000BOAZM8|5|put a stash of this gook on an exhaust pipe,  there is quite  good service
B002MQCY7C|4|Works as intended. Wish it fitted tighter when it slides in to connect. Certainly easier and quicker than the tie strap method!
B0060A7JI0|5|needed it
B000F285EG|3|Works great!
B000QV2D4E|5|Meets my expectations and will fit my needs.
B00B1FQHNC|5|Product was received in the expected time frame and fit well!!!!
B00NGOS022|5|Perfect replacement for my car mirror that broke. Exactly as described and I appreciated the adhesive tabs to help secure it.
B0010GFW88|5|Dealership price was too much.  The amp is in and working good so far. 07 GMC Acadia
B00NLG4Q2I|4|Loved it. I got a set for front and back.
B000C2EGCE|5|Just what I needed
B00DQZ5VLE|5|Better than expected. The quality is great. Shipping was just as described.
B00A00IIJU|5|Perfect fit.

B0067SLSHS|5|Works great!
B004SS8UUM|4|Nice laynard. I'm in Nursing School and was always having to dig around in my bag for keys. Now they are much easier to find.
B0041FZ8L6|5|exceent buy would recommend one for anyone that has trouble getting into the back of the truck. For people with leg problems it works very well
B002VFH5J6|5|Perfect fit for my 2011 WRX. Wouldn't have thought the old one would get as dirty as it was in just 50k miles.
B0014JL96A|4|Item worked perfectly.
B001EAQTRI|5|Does as advertised. I use this in my pickup to take the high pitched squeal out of the radio when I plug my phone into the aux jack and charge it at the same time. It is a little bulky so you will have to get creative to find a place to hide it but it's worth it to me to have clean sound.
B009YR00MI|2|Well, it wouldn't jump start my 2015 Chevy Silverado! It did make the starter motor click. I wonder why the AAA technician brought a beater battery pack and the truck fired right up? Let's see what else it can't do....
B00S1NT2SE|4|Okay functional not well made.
B005JU5UEW|5|very good
B000HS6SF6|5|Good fit nice sound.excellent.
B004Q1DANS|5|It was just what they said it was. And the size was just right using their chart. Shipping it came in days before I thought it would.It's a great helmet and matches my scooter great. I would recommend it to everyone and I have.
B004EWI8M2|5|product good
B00MSE89CC|5|Required for removal of catalytic converter and D plate installation to convert Yamaha 1200 cc engine from oil injected to premix.  If you have a waverunner DO THIS before the oil injection system fails and you end up in the middle of the lake with your engine in pieces!  Slight mixup with order which was immediately corrected by seller.
B00BP5VUY4|5|need to use oil to get them on then glue them
B008MOOD8Q|5|fit perfect on equinox2013
B003UT3S6Q|4|Its a fantastic product. It's also fantastically expensive. I clean the whole wheel, not just the face.  There is enough product to cover 9 1/2 wheels.  In other words, ALMOST twice.
B002R105L4|4|I took a rock to my marker light while traveling down the highway which cracked my light.  I looked at the reviews for this replacement light and decided to purchase it.  Like the reviews said there is a little more of a gap on the trailing edge where the light meets up with the fender. For this is the reason I am giving it a 4/5.  No one will ever notice but myself.  Other than that, the light seems to be of good quality and priced much better than OEM for my 16 year old 4runner.
B00PJ21ZX0|4|Very good, real loud clear wish there was more bass but overall real nice.<br /><br />Con: screen is unreadable while riding bike and I have it angled right at me in middle of handle bars better off jus mounting unit remote.<br />Also wish the wired remote lit up.<br />Pro: Super loud no joke. Clean criso almost can go to 100% volume maybe 1 to 2 clicks below full before distortion.
B00YAMUMAW|1|Adhessive used not good, came off the bike.
B004MWTW1U|5|Very nice decal.  Looks great, and easy to install.
B00WDSVEE8|5|Price was right, product even better. Far exceeded my expectations. Well built,very effective. Would by again if i lost them
B003CJCCKM|4|The part was exactly as promoted and arrived very fast. It was exactly what I needed.
B000C7YQIS|5|Good price and good quality.
B002QHFHNU|5|Awesome product fast and easy to install. The fastgun turnbuckle blocks the gas door on my 2004 double cab Tundra, but all I have to do is unhook the safety pin, lift up the handle and the unit is unhooked allowing me to fill up. Again, fast and easy.
B0084UK7XI|2|The front two are OK, the back two are useless. Even with the clips they rattle and fall out. I use the front two only and its not a problem, I raley put the rear widow down and it looks on since my rear windows are tinted very dark. Besides that they are all micro scratched. It is not a clean clear plastic. Looks like they were cleaned by a dirty towel or a ruff dry towel.
B000C5YCZ2|5|Excellent price. Excellent product.
B007W45M6O|5|Completely woke my truck up after replacing the OEM exhaust with this aFe system.  A programmer is required as this deletes both the DPF and CAT.  If loud is what you're looking for this is it, roll the windows down hear the twins roar as the only restriction is the downpipe.  Removing the old system tougher than the installation took maybe 30 minutes after I got the old system out.  Unless you're going to save the old system, just take a saw to it and save yourself hours of hassel.
B0074Y3R5A|5|Fit 08 zx6r and are very comfortable
B00CMVB5R2|5|Worked perfect, fast shipping, easy install
B00KY0DF9Y|5|Bought this as a replacement for a 10SI single wire on an upgrade Ford 8N tractor.  I chose this as a replacement for several reasons--The higher charging current, the additional cooling capacity, the fact that a 3 wire setup does a better job of charging the battery.  I have added extra lights and an electric cooling fan so wanted a better charging rate.
B000KL19SQ|5|Perfect fit.  Thanks
B004PC4AOG|1|Nothing fit right they are way too long. Look like you are riding with 2 feet of pipe on your bike. I guess you get what you pay for.
B004GCFAM6|5|Perfect fit for my 2003 Honda Element. Easy Install.
B00H2VVQNU|5|great product - goes on thin...do not put on too much at one time...if it does what it claims - I will be happy
B000CLJ73S|5|A+ for warehouse deals. Description, fit, and delivery were right on target. Great deal!
B0066QT33C|5|OE part for half the price of OEM - love it
B001F1Q2CS|2|Would be great if I could use it. I cannot get the kicker bars, amazon keeps saying it is on back order (since june) really sad and a waste of money.
B00LGZYS10|5|I bought this gift as a birthday present for my mom and she loved it...ran out and put it on her truck window right away. LOL!
B000CGINTW|5|This axle shaft is like for like compared to the original part. Included with the axle are bearings, bearing oil seal, studs and lug nuts. WARNING: the axle does NOT have the O-ring where the C-clip gets  inserted. Transfer the old O-ring to the new axle by use of a dental pick. This O-ring does not act as a seal of any kind it is just some sort of cushioning device and perhaps to make the C-clip fit a little tighter. This axle was made in India. Summit Racing also sells this axle sold by Dorman and the tech reps at Summit Racing speak highly of Dorman parts for ordinary every day original equipment replacement parts. Praise does not get much higher than that. I did not press my studs in place, I put the studs in the holes in the flange. Then applied a lubricant to the studs. Thread the lug nut on with  the FLAT side to the axle flange. Then tighten with an impact or use a breaker bar. It will require quite a bit of force, but the lug nut will pull the  in with stud and fully seat the stud onto the back side of the flange. I lubricated the stud so not to damage the threads since you will be applying quite a bit of force to the lug nut. I could not use the supplied lug nut because they were  not compatible with my original 1988 Town Car alloy wheels. I had to use the original lug nuts. You could also buy an axle from Rock auto for less money (about $100) or at Summit for about $100.  I removed the old bearing and seal at the same time with a rented bearing puller and slide hammer. I put in the new bearing and oil seal with a 1.5 inch deep impact socket and hammer.
B00EOX2IRW|1|Do not bother if you have Whirlpool Duet pedestals.  I had some hope that some of the other reviews were wrong, but I shouldn't have wasted my time.  The drawer doesn't open by a good 3/4&#34;.  The plastic is not pliable enough to try to force it open.  I am returning it.<br /><br />However, I did walk my 260lb washer over the lip and into place and then back out with no damage.  It is definitely a good piece of plastic, just advertised wrong if you have one of the post popular pedestals on the market.
B008BLPMOO|5|Exlent products and good shipping
B000BZIL3C|5|Perfect fir
B000C04O5K|5|good stuff
B00DMMU2MY|5|Love it!
B00IS95GZE|5|Nice look some like my self will even call it sexy lol just make sure you match it up perfectly the 3m tape is no joke sticky it won come off for nothing which I like
B00NOL6RSG|5|I have got a great deal buying it. The lights are very cheap and they are very bright too. At this price I don’t think I could have got anything better than this. Also the wire is long enough and that made it all the more easier for me to install it in my ambulance.
B008VHUIQK|5|This company sent the Dual Capacitor out the same day....this was really appreciated because my family was suffering from heat exhaustion.<br /><br />Thank you!
B000CITKCE|5|Love this thing!  I've been using this on my jet ski (which I keep on a floating dock) for the last 3 months.  It keeps the battery charged enough, so that I can jump on and ride at any time.  With the jet ski being kept on a floating dock, that means that this battery tender is exposed to the weather 24/7.  Being in Florida, we get extreme heat, and extreme storms.  3 months in, and this thing still does the job.  What really impressed me though is that one time I didn't give the cable enough slack.  It eventually ended up getting disconnected from the jet ski, and fell in the water (salt water).  It must've been in the salt water for a couple of days before I found it, as I didn't ride the ski for about a week.  I dried it off, plugged it back up, and its still working perfectly fine.
B0024GQ1AG|5|Nice helmet! It's a lot cooler for summer riding. It's light weight and very comfortable and it looks good too!
B00M78820I|2|I was not a fan of the Car Sun Shade Jumbo for the following reasons:<br /><br />(1) Fit - I bought it for my 2005 Subaru Forester. While I could get it in place to block around 75% of the front windshield surface area, putting it up was always a struggle. On the best days it would only cover 85% of the surface area. The corners folded in always exposing part of the windshield. Plus, it always took about 60 seconds to get it set on the windshield.<br /><br />(2) No Aluminum Reflective Material - There is no aluminum reflective material on this. The plastic is just a silver color. I don't think it reflects much sun to be honest with you. My steering wheel still felt hot when I got back in my car.<br /><br />After using this for about a month, I bought an accordian folding aluminum-covered shade from another vendor. I am really happy that I did. It goes on in about 5 seconds, is a perfect fit for my vehicle, and keeps the inside of my car much cooler. This was a better choice for me even though it was about twice as expensive as this sunshade.
B005G0ZSQA|5|SICK!
B00OZ6SOGM|5|This plug is off the chain. I bouth this for my housekeepers car an Audi A4 2010 2.0T great fit and no leaks. The main thing is that the original was an allen plug and because some auto mechanics are so cheap they strip the head a little, so this one is perfect!
B000C53Z9Q|5|Used these to replace worn rear springs on a '97 Grand Marquis. These provide a near stock spring rate and load rate resulting in a very comfortable ride. Now my car doesn't sink or boat excessively with six passengers and luggage.
B000E4OK3K|3|All plastic and youre going to need different hardware since the studs are smaller than the original. Once installed, it works perfect.
B000Q81B4K|4|I love my other weather tech mats I have in my car, but this one could stand to be just a little bit bigger to cover more space under the driver and front passenger seats, especially when the driver seat has to be adjusted closer to the dash.
B00NO08IX4|5|OEM part - thank you
B00L2PRQ8G|5|I've been using it for a while now and I like it the best. I have used the regular NT (standard in the kits) and a CNS carb. CNS was a mess, nuff said. The NT worked very well although I think the only difference between an NT this one is the jet size.<br />I'd buy it again.
B0017OANWI|2|These bulbs give out good bright light. Unfortunately, after less than 7 months one has burnt out already.
B00857CM8S|5|It awesome detail is excelkent
B00REJX764|4|So I'm pretty happy with this considering the price. I found that if you put the tailgate seal on then it actually holds the back of the cover up a little and I didn't like the looks of it. So I took it off. Without it there is a little gap because of how tight the vinyl is. I think they could probably place the clamps further towards the back and it would help seal up the back better. But then maybe the middle would rise more, not sure. But it's exactly what I was expecting. I like the hard covers but I actually use my truck for hauling things and didn't want the trouble of taking a hard cover off. I'm happy with this.
B00BGPMZZ6|5|Nice looking
B00252GRJY|3|Does NOT fit a Volvo V70 2001, the Amazon parts finder/garage did state that it does, BUT it doesnt, dont make the same mistakeI did
B007SYVREY|4|It is a good light it does real good for what I wanted
B000A113WI|1|Hitch did not fit. Modifications had to be done to thevrear bumper and longer bolts had to be purchased as well.
B003S6GWQ4|5|Works and looks great.  Thanks
B003Q1U71W|4|they look great.
B0060A9JQK|5|This glass was a perfect fit, easy to install and the enclosed sticky pads are still sticking!
B0050VGZLM|5|I have found these very useful and as of now have one attached to my wife's key's, which I have to help her chase several times per week, as well as having glued one onto the bottom of a MacAir which I may put down nearly anywhere around my home or office. Problem is it's so thin that it slides under papers or books, so that having it hooked up has saved much time in at least ascertaining what floor it's on. I have no lack of objects to which to attach one of the 4 beepers that come with the central call unit.<br /><br />Great example of use was yesterday when my wife's car keys were &#34;in (my) pocketbook&#34; but not visible after I'd dumped out numerous objects, yet the beeping sound came from the table where it lay. As I moved the pocketbook closer, beeped again, the sound still came from the table where, as it turns out, the keys lay under the substantial Sunday edition of the paper. This may sound not so smart but would otherwise have taken another several minutes to track down after open every part of this medium large pocketbook. Two minutes here and there over the week saves 20-30 minutes per week plus much frustration.<br /><br />The largest problem, or limitation of these devices is probably inevitable: you can't simultaneously have them small enough to be convenient and loud enough to be heard from everywhere, but I doubt anyone else can either. Otherwise, they've been quite useful and I've gotten value for the price. I can easily see these being round-the-year gifts for those who seem to need nothing else I'm likely to buy them.<br /><br />One of the best aspects of the product is that the seller is very interested in customer satisfaction, wiling to provide individual attention, and I'm sure if I ever need her help she'd respond very, very quickly. Something great about dealing with a small, personalized, caring business and owner.
B00192JGDU|5|We love this table. We got it at a steal of a price. It is a great addiont to our camping gear.
B008HZMP30|5|Perfect
B00S0JSOQU|2|I bought three different dash cams. This was the first and I returned it.<br /><br />It's way too big, so if you have something on the side of your mirror such as a Toll i-pass or similar, view may be blocked.<br /><br />Couldn't adjust camera angle: so, like most people, the mirror is not facing perfectly to the front, so Iost all the left side of the camera view due to angle. The camera has all the impression of allowing adjustment but couldn't find out how on the cam nor online.<br /><br />Mirror is darkened: so its not very clear to see, specially with sunglasses.<br /><br />I went with a garmin dash cam instead and I'm very happy.
B00BITHTAG|5|very nice
B001HR2L16|2|Did not fit 1999 BMW 323i, oil level sending unit comes with seal attached.
B008XKGLS4|4|It works well
B00JGQKHKM|5|Worked great I read other reviews about the clips not working but these installed on my 2012 with no problems and these things are super bright also
B009DIWCDS|1|did not fit my vehicle even though it is listed as a direct fit. returned with no problem.
B008UVVFQ4|3|one of them keeps fogging up..
B005LGTT1E|5|Thank you Sincerely z.k
B00FTB2U26|5|good and easy to install
B0067DZTXW|5|Had on in the car and I took a whiff of it and had an amazing aroma to it. So I bought dome in bulk for the car I drive.
B0012ILZAS|5|5 Stars for these horns, I installed them on my 34 ft Silverton Boat and they are so Awesomely Loud. I love them, Great buy
B0055AW0N0|5|Its perfect for my needs. A little awkward between the seats.
B00008RW9U|5|I knew I loved it when I bought it. No more dirty car in this drought. Fast shipping, great product.
B00OUL26PM|1|GARBAGE!!!! DO NOT BUY, SELLER IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH. THE COLORS ARE NOT WHAT THE IMAGES CLAIM TO BE!! THESE ARE CHEAP CHINESE MADE LIGHTS BEING SOLD BY SOMEONE OUT OF THEIR GARAGE!
B00B5UJ9HO|5|LOOKS GREAT ON MY AMMO BOX
B00KJGPMZI|5|I finally got my headset someplace else but they work great! First one never got to me. Best on the market id say. Battery life is great and works great. Every so often you will have a bug but sena puts out and update that fixes it! I couldn't imagine riding without this! Listen to music and talk with bud or make a call at same time. Put ear buds away and buy these. I swear you wont regret it!
B00H7LPKKU|4|Great product.  Much better than a standard tip.  It can still get stuck and is a little bigger than a standard tip. Over all the this product will make greasing much faster and cleaner.  Will by more in the future.  This one can be rebuilt and come with a rebuild kit.
B0094JKMII|5|So far worked out well!  Strong.  Arrived on time.
B002P8D5J8|5|This mirror was an exact fit for my 1999 Ford Explorer Sport.  I would highly recommend this seller.
B00PEWNQOG|5|Great stuff
B009IF1Q4W|5|This item works fine on my Chevy Cruze. No problem, just take bad one out ant put it new one ok
B00OFEBLSW|1|They are definitely not for a 2015 Ram 1500.. The add says it is but will not work
B00HSCNM4O|2|I used this on my vinyl couch to repair ripped cushions. i bought vinyl material, sprayed this on the back and covered the seat cushions.  It started to peel up after a month.
B00C7Z4N3Q|1|small for my motorcycle
B00GSAUHB8|5|Love this sunshade! It's easy to put up in a hurry if you're running late for work. And it's easy to twist up and slide between my seats to store. Fits perfectly in a 2012 Hyundai elantra. I still have to put my visors down to keep it in place but I use it everyday because it's so convenient. I would definitely recommend. Ditch the accordion shade and buy this one.
B000C2E5T8|5|It is a gasket. No problems with it
B002GTKAHQ|4|Bought two pairs, one mirror fell off on the first ride. (First review 3 stars)  2 months of use now and the ATV flipped, one broke off and the second miraculously survived and works though it got very banged up. I gave it an extra star for durability
B009EADIO2|5|Exactly what we expected it to be!
B002QD8SFI|3|The tool its self is very good and suppliments the master kit I purchased a few years ago.  The only thing that sucks, is it came with the manual for cars up to 2008...thats what my old kit has, this kit updates fittings to cars up to 2013, and I still got the old manual?!?!  Now I have to try to find the right manual which everyone seems to be out of stock for a few months.
B003L35936|5|Good deal
B00JIIZCM6|5|Worked well, will order again.
B00TLHPE4A|5|GREAT lights. Bright!
B007PJ2CXW|1|This part was not a Mercruiser 7.4L MPI alternator. Neither the bolts and mounting nor the wiring connections were correct.
B000F1Y7OO|4|My original factory mats were getting worn and frayed. I these Premier custom mats saw them on Amazon. So I purchased them. Perfect fit on all four mats. They are almost as good as original Mercedes at half the cost. Shipping was no charge too.  . Original mats still better made but a good value for the price point.
B00BQ04C7K|3|Does the job but miffed that the factory part doesn't last very long.
B00681BE2S|5|Awesome product
B00BFE5JQK|5|The seal works perfectly and solved the issues.
B00O6530S4|5|Great kit, high quality and compact.  Stores just about anywhere...
B000C7TUMU|5|Great quality
B00CX7KXLE|5|Installed easily. Look great and function properly. Great value.
B00C5RB03W|5|Fits perfectly on our 5th wheel camper
B000701HF0|5|This is the second time we have used this item for our travel trailer hot water heater. Works exactly as needed, arrived on time and reasonable price!
B00DCX96I4|5|Has done a super job of protecting remotes. Still looks new after 1year. Well made. Have two of these and glad I purchased them.
B00X72IO9C|5|Great
B00B2AEV4S|5|Hard to complain, this was the best price & availability at the time when I needed this driveshaft to go with a SYE kit. Fit, function, it does the job well. Beefier than a stock front XJ driveshaft. Only complaint, if anything, would be the cheaply done paint job on it...but that's grasping at straws.
B00SXEQ86U|5|I haven't used this cover for a long time, less than a month because I bought it recently.  So I cannot comment on its durability.  I use it mainly to protect my car from the sun when parked under the carport. The carport gets the sun and it's hot here.<br /><br />I have no complaints about this item.  I can wrap it easily around the car even when there is a breeze.  Since this cover is light, it's a bit more difficult to do in breeze conditions, but I don't have much problem doing it.  I don't think I could deal with it if the wind was strong though.<br /><br />I live in a dry climate where it basically never rains so it's ideal for these conditions.  I wouldn't use this when it rains but it's not what it is for.<br /><br />In short I got what I wanted and I am please with this item.
B00REJXHIM|5|Recently purchased this cover for my 2014 Toyota Tacoma. Installation was easy and cover made my pick up look awesome! Just returned from taking the family on a road trip from Texas to California and spent two weeks on the road. Encountered extreme heat and rain on our trip and bed cover withstood all elements and kept rain out of truck bed where we carried our luggage! Definitely would recommend this cover to everyone.
B00RD7KPTO|5|It is one of the funnier ones I have seen so I got it and just have had nothing but laughs from it.
B00JEUHVOU|5|Best thing I ever bought for the interior on my XJ.
B00USO9YVO|1|Much much smaller than shown
B00B2JCNSK|5|Quality oil that meets the specs needed at a reasonable enough price to keep me out of wal-mart.
B0009JKGJW|5|The best gas and oil additive that I've ever used for gasoline engines. A little per tankful of MM13R cleans spark plugs, carbs or fuel injectors, top-end deposits, and lubricates the fuel system for smoother idling. You can hear and feel the engine performance difference in a few tanks of gas or less.<br /><br />You may also get 1-2 mpg better mileage with up to 10% ethanol-blended gasoline. It essentially pays for itself while doing good internal engine work with no fuss. Relatively inexpensive per bottle and on the U.S. market since 1923. A non-smoking gas/oil additive that is alright for cars and trucks with catalytic converters.
B0058EDGE0|4|Works great but occasionally slips if I put to much pressure on it. It only has 2 allen screws that tighten down on your buffer rod.
B000IYSKBY|5|Product did exactly as it says worked woderful!!! Had to replace 30 amp fuse under the hood that blew when original fan failed fits my 02 sl2 great!!
B003CSP1EM|5|great quality, easy to use, easily removable and keeps things secure with tail gate lock.
B00XZ9N6J0|5|Excellent.
B008BZU5OW|5|Worked great
B007HRND44|5|What I needed . Great transaction
B00IY3YLCI|5|Very Bright!  I used these on a Toro ZTR mower.  They flood the yard with brilliant white light making it easy to mow at night and consume a tad under 1.5 amps each making it a no brainer for mower lighting.  One of my neighbors commented that they lit up the whole neighborhood as I was out testing it.  Housings in summertime heat seem to do a great job extracting heat.  These would definitely make for great vehicle fog / road lights.
B000CPCBF0|5|Have looked inside to see if it's working :)
B00KRQVW68|5|Shipped fast, quality product.  I love it.
B00DSVMCQS|5|This vest is awesome! Make sure you order it at least one size higher for proper fit. (i.e. if you normally wear a Large, order an XL). Everything else about the vest is perfect especially all the pockets.
B00T1RKITG|5|The item was good and easy to apply. I will give it five stars to it for the kind of service by the seller and their dedication to make things work for a person who was doing it for the first time.
B001GC2LVM|5|Works well
B007UTPUPO|5|Looks and works great!
B007USCM7E|5|This item came with easy to understand instructions and made a definite improvement to the air coming out of the cars vents. I will be buying more of these.
B00EUZZK60|5|Perfect for what I wanted. Secure, easy to install / remove and looks great. Gas mileage improved as well.
B004UHG8FK|1|This battery arrived too weak to start my Honda Metropolitan and will not hold a charge.
B00MGSC2IW|5|Perfect fit ...
B00KTIY4ZA|5|worked great right key pad shipped quickly, pleasure doing busines
B001GQ41NY|5|We were surprised that the item is so sturdy.  My wife is very happy with it.
B000PW9S7E|5|best product on the market
B00979N8MW|4|Great gloves, though I would question the size.  My son's hands were the same size as mine when he was 6-- point being they're very tiny.  The tip top of my middle finger to the base of my palm is only 6 inches... the &#34;medium&#34; fits really tight on my hands.  They definitely work for me though wouldn't be very comfortable to work in if my hands were any bigger.
B001CF1A6U|5|Great quality tow hook.  Will give many years service to my Jeep Wrangler.
B006L76RXU|5|Much enjoyment outta this
B00W8JB6PY|5|Great  material , looks beautiful, and great delivery time.
B00KTGLMYS|5|perfect fit
B00HQZASRW|5|couldn't have an rv without it!
B00CIZ8GG0|5|LOVE it!
B00IS90I98|5|These parts are exactly what I needed to &#34;spruce up&#34; my 2001 Chevy Silverado.
B00M2SYXN8|5|Strong broke my winch before I broke the rope
B003ZOH63W|4|It took me about 15 minutes, including the climb up onto my trailer to remove the old and install the new antenna on the old mount.  Without any rotation or tuning I received about six channels.  We camped at several campgrounds and had the same result.  I consider it a great purchase.
B00K87WD8C|1|Rubber boot ripped after a month... Very cheaply made
B001NYE26U|5|goodgood
B000RN04VU|5|Works great had plenty of tiedowns
B000BQSQOK|5|Exact OEM product. Excellent
B00BKNNRZ6|5|Great product
B007WICK4M|4|the cover was quick to install and fit the dash well, but not satisfied with how it fits over the light sensor.  the hole in the mat rides up on the sensor, causing the automatic headlights to come on anytime the windshield is not in direct sunlight.
B00GYDBPL0|4|For the price, I thought they would be more metal. The ribbon is completely plastic. But they look great and are sturdy. I love them!
B00ELHNM3K|3|Seem to be getting less MPG compared to Castrol synth blend.
B00AFPVYE6|4|These fit my 2007 Nissan Altima great. My only complaint: the front passenger door handle didn't fit as great as the other three handles. The cut was a few centimeters off around the keyless entry sensor, but it's not that noticeable unless you're studying the handle itself. It doesn't even hinder the sensor from working; it's just a small cosmetic flaw. Overall, these handles make my car look like a million bucks and I'm very pleased. Time will tell how well they hold up.
B00CD0HGDE|3|I wish the light wasn't so damn bright. In the nights I have to hide it under my bed so I can sleep in pitch darkness. I wish the light would come on once when I plug my phone in and then when my phone is completely charged instead of just being on the whole time. The blue light is so ANNOYING!
B00GSAUHB8|5|&#34;My experience with this seller was excellent! The sunshade was as described, and it works great!! I would definitely buy again, and recommend to a family member, or friend!&#34;
B00230GVLC|5|Good value, fit like they should and would buy again
B00EOPUSF4|4|Great part great price
B00G3BRNOG|5|Good deal
B0036IQ90S|5|Worked very good
B009SX3P6Q|5|Product was as described.
B007JSH7O8|1|Let me say that the frame itself looks very nice.  It wasn't as good a quality as the other frame I bought but not bad.  My problem is that it doesn't fit an Illinois license plate! I tried it on four different plates and it is about a quarter of an inch to small.  To my knowledge Illinois does not have over sized plates so I'm not sure if plates vary on a state by state basis but I've never had this problem with a frame before. I am in the process of returning it now but with fairly expensive shipping both ways I will be lucky to get half of my money back overall.
B002NBOWI0|5|I've been replacing my air filter every 13 months using this product. Easy installation,  that's all I can say.
B002G29LLE|5|I love these. They are my second set. Very firm and work great for tires or other straight line trim. I'll get more.
B006QZ7Z4W|5|Delivered in 4 days. Very happy with it so far. The range is double what I expected for the size of it.
B00873J0YY|5|Does exactly what they are supposed to do. Took my husband and I MAYBE 15 minutes from box to rooftop.
B00XM1NC40|5|Good quality product
B00BJL29QM|1|If I could give neg. feedback I would ! I do read reviews but ultimately I choose to do what I want in life and ordering this was no exception. I am not impressed with this product at all!<br />First off it smells nothing like leather. NOTHING !<br /><br />Second, the chemical smell gave me such a headache I threw the rest of this crap in the trash !<br /><br />The only good thing about these is the fact that the smell lasts maybe 10 minutes and then its gone even in South Texas direct sunlight. Its been in the 100's around San Antonio for the last week or two and my truck is black. I know it gets nice and hot inside the truck and I assumed (like any other air freshener) the heat brings out the smell.<br /><br />Save your money !!! stay clear of this product..... its worthless !!!!!
B003CGDPVK|5|Fit my 2002 tj very easily took me about ten minutes to put it on and I love the look . I use this In the summer and take the back seats out and let the dogs have a blast rolling around town with their faces smushed into the mesh smelling the wind. This is secure enough that I do not worry about the dogs getting out and it dose not require any tools to apply . Easily the best accessory I have purchased for my jeep in terms of ease and cost of application.
B003U4D3PM|5|Works very well in the back seat. Now my boys won't spill all over the car.
B000C9JCIK|5|Exact fit and match!!!! It was perfect great fit bolted right up no problems at all. Only took 20minutes to install and was on my way.
B000LN2XR4|5|Great fit no problems with this order
B003MB4NUC|1|Was sold as a fit for 2002 Expedition but does not fit.
B000V5PAEK|5|Great heavy duty belt
B00FJH70R0|5|Excellent match
B002T0AW16|5|Good product.
B00607QH9K|5|Seems well built with good reviews
B002IBRI9K|3|Not as bright as I expected.
B000C57S1W|4|i can haul about twice as much as i used to
B00VAVUSZA|3|We only got the front set. The company was out of the back set. Since it is the front set that was difficult to track down, it is only slightly inconvenient that we didn't get what was listed. As far as the product, the car is running better; but since the back ones aren't on, I can't say much more than that. Anything is better than what was on the car before changing them.
B00HNMLQAG|5|Perfect
B00BQYCKE8|4|excellent
B0090Q8IJA|4|Send on time as promised, didn't fix my problem which appears to be some other burned out electrical component on the bike.
B005FV2RQY|5|Just what I ordered and wanted,
B00BGEO7DK|5|Love the mats. They work well and hold up great. They save my Grand Cherokee from muddy shoes. The mats are easy to put in and remove when needed for washing. Work well and worth every penny!
B00080QHMM|5|Quick and easy to use, nice at night or dusk when I always seem to be checking my truck and trailer tires. High pressure reading helps too for the truck tires.
B00KL3ALGO|5|I love these! As a woman who takes great care to limit my sun exposure for the sake of my skin, these are very handy! They stay up on the window and are easily adjusted and/or removed. A small investment towards making your skincare $$$ more effective. I've recommended them and will be purchasing more as gifts. As a business woman, I'm also very impressed with their follow up and marketing efforts!
B00QNUO7FK|5|This is my second order of these rags.  One is good enough to dry my car after washing, but really needed a second for when I do the SUV or for when the other is in the wash.
B000AS3D42|5|Use on my pristine 1997 Lexus LS400 - works very good - especially with the Mag1 5w - 30 synthetic oil!!
B00FVPZKR2|4|I installed the alarm by using the plug and play diconecting the plug with the loop wire and conecting the plug from the alarm directly into the scooter plug.....did not use the plug with the wires from the alarm but the only problem is that I can't start the scooter from the remote control...if someone knows why it dosen't start remotely please let me know....thanks
B000C53RXA|5|What difference these shocks made to my vehicle. No more small bumps are felt and the bigger ones are near as bad. Pretty smooth ride
B001URUSDQ|4|I guess I really haven't done much review writing.  This was a good deal  I got it for the winter months.  It is much more convenient to put on this one unit than all the layers of other things you'd need to put on to go outside.  I like it.
B000B61WEG|5|Exactly as described; Extremely fast delivery.  Thanks!
B00WED26WQ|5|great!
B00MAOK0CW|3|Just ok. second set i've had for bike cause they color fade so quickly. this new set has already started to fade and i just bought them. they look sharp when brand new.
B000KL6QHU|5|It took a little while to get here , but it works fantastic !!
B00EKEGRVS|1|Don't bother these brake and fall,off constantly.
B000CSW7GK|5|GREAT VALUE WORKS GOOD
B001S2VKZI|1|First one didn't last one year. The trailer manufacturer sent a new one and after 2 years most of the buttons don't work and those that do work don't respond properly. Most expensive piece of junk I have purchased in a long time.<br />Will NEVER touch a Jensen product again!
B008X02JIU|5|Exact fit and easy install
B004TRKBOK|5|Awesome deal
B001C6Q34S|1|Does not fit a 2014 Subaru Forester as was described.  Of no use to me but too expensive to send back.
B00MIA309S|4|Overall, the shifter works well. Not the highest quality, but not low quality either. Does feel smaller in your hand than the stock shifter on a Honda Fit, but you get used to it.
B005G5S2WW|4|They're thin but great for the money.
B004BWU8H8|5|Top quality sturdy heavy duty lockable storage.<br />Holds 2 sub compact pistols and extra mags.<br />Absolutely necessary for secure storage of your valuables,a must buy.
B003JBVL00|5|Exactly what I wanted. Thanks
B004ME8MZ0|4|mirrors fit perfect ,look great, work great , have a vibration to them at high speed but not enough so you can't see ok. Only thing I did not like is on my chevy silvarado  I have mirrors that match the paint on my truck, after taking the towing  mirrors off after first trip I noticed marks on my paint, it was coming from inside the new mirrors , on the new mirrors there are tiny ridges on the inside that look like they came from the molding process ,that were not sanded down properly, even though they put a small amount of thin protective tape on that side, it still left small marks on my mirrors, I sanded them down a little more , then called K SOURCE who makes these and explained to them what happened , and ask them to send me some more protective  tape and they did after I provided proof of purchase and pictures of the scratches.
B004AH4OJC|5|Exactly as advertised and a heck of a lot cheaper than my local WalMart.
B00P2VL8IK|5|Good
B003D4O9JS|1|W/o a muffler shop there's no way this will be an easy install on a PT Cruiser Turbo
B00B7SL73I|5|Perfect replacement, easy to install.
B0006307WW|4|Some say the K&Ns offer no real improvements for the money invested but I've been putting them in my vehicles for several years.  They give the engine a bit more growl.  You decide.
B005BTL4RI|5|Purchased to replace a worn-out Honda CR-V tire cover, this new cover looks and fits great on our car. Boomerang called me to confirm that my order would fit my vehicle. Great customer service, and fast delivery.
B00KTLZPS2|5|When I got this bike I was excited gotta really frustrated when I had to take all the nuts out to get to the bike after putting on the handle bars I was ready to ride but the bike wouldn't start I called monster moto and they said the carparator might be flooded I went to the website watch the video and boom my bike worked if you have the same problem make sure you have carparator spray first bike goes very fast must have tags helmet license to ride I will be ordering this product again
B000GU3KHO|5|Great cover!  Saved bike in couple of rainy days.  Good luck packing it back in carrying case...lol
B00MAQMZSW|2|These are probably very good fenders, but they have a terrible smell that doesn't go away.
B009Y7CZCG|5|So far I love it! It makes my 2012 Impreza look so much better.
B00ZV1E1U8|5|Very satisfied
B00FJ5HAJU|5|This is my second purchase from these people and I got near 5 years from first one and probably would have got more except an idiot friend left the parking light on!
B004JV6OMO|5|Functioned as advertised
B003YMRNWY|5|Worked and fit exactly as it should. Great deal from warehouse deals. Great description, delivery, and price.
B004AY3NHE|4|On the right type of repair I think this would work great. In fact, it worked pretty ok on a repair it doesn't claim to work on, a mechanical break near the entrance to the resonator on my Focus. Its something like fiberglass mat coated with sticky asphalt tar. Keep that in mind when planning your repair. It definitely helps to heat it up somehow before applying. I stuck it on in 80 degree weather and heating helped a bunch. When its hot its sort of stretchy feeling and gives you a lot more confidence. Also, if the repair area is smaller, which it should be, or your expectations are too high, just keep wrapping around the same area, don't do the 1 inch over lap they recommend on the bag. This should get me through one more winter in my white trash winter beater before it gets turned into Chinese tuna cans.
B00GD8HQSW|5|As discribed, quick delivery
B00QU88EHM|5|worked great
B00L9F3HI2|5|Absolutely frustrated and unhappy.  Packaging was great--it was double boxed.  But when I took the unit out of the box, removed the styrofoam end caps and plastic bag, the unit/head was deeply scratched and marred and it looked like someone had taken sandpaper to the finish.<br />UPDATE:  I was contacted directly by Menachem Abrams regarding this situation. He made it right and has taken steps to correct the problem.  It is never about how an organization does routine things routinely, it is how they respond to adversity and the unforeseen.  I appreciate that Abrams responded quickly and corrected the situation. That is how loyalty is built.
B000BGK22E|5|Great product easy to install.
B001UHQXQ2|5|Great product fast shipping.  And it does smell nice.
B000C9PVZS|5|ok
B00JB2WJX4|5|Good quality, look's great.
B00VGL6QLY|5|good value
B000MD4YNY|5|good deal////about the same at store, but a little cheaper
B00R56ZQCE|5|Worked great! Holes lined up perfect to those marked on vehicle!
B00F5MUB66|5|Best shower head on the market.  The shower hose is a little stiff until hot water is turned on.
B000CO7I04|5|Exactly what I needed.  Great product for the money.
B009DJWJHQ|5|Fit perfectly and looks like OEM.
B0031H0H5M|3|This does NOT fit a '91 F-350. The gear is too large for the motor housing, as are the plugs...they will almost fit with the original gear (which was in fine shape), but there's no way to fit more that one in at a time.
B0049W06GS|4|The cover fit well and was exactly like described.
B00XV9QRXQ|4|Looks good on my we
B00317DY48|5|Fast easy installation, competitive price and helping a good cause win win win
B00JKBSHAA|5|This is solidly built, fit together nicely, and was easy to assemble. Works well, and is useful for multiple puposes.
B00C53NU7K|5|Works great!! Trunk button not working, but I read there is a valet trunk release switch that has to be flipped for it to work? I can lock from my apartment window! Battery works good. Panic button Perfect helps me find my car! Ladies it's easy to program, done it myself! I have a 2009 Nissan Sentra (base)
B000OCIX9E|5|good product tank you
B00H7DT0UY|5|Bought this battery for our Yamaha Raptor 350. The battery fits perfect and started the quad on the first crank. Well worth the money.
B000E3BVX8|5|I purchased this seat to build a heavy duty office chair.  I never intended it to be in a vehicle.  I just got tired of all my chairs breaking in six months to a year.  Three years later, and my chair is good as new.
B000C32ISC|5|Does not look like the picture, but still a great product. One belt to rule them all.
B00MGFFUSO|5|The mounts had a great price and where exactly what I was looking for.  I have been looking them for awhile and I found a great product at a great price.
B000Q6SL2W|5|Tested air leak on my 13' Mercedes E350.  the adapter cap had a tight seal on the brake fluid master cylinder.  pumped air pressure to 15 psi and waited for pressure drop, dropped to 12 psi in about two minutes.  pumped air pressure again to 15 psi, and pressure will come down to 12 psi in two min.  I think this should be good enough to pressure flush the brake fluid out when I am ready to change the brake fluid.  If not, I can ask a helper to keep pumping to the desired pressure.  The motive products power bleeder black label will save me a lot considering the mercedes dealer's expensive charges.
B0091OE6II|5|Works great keeping seatbelt from neck.
B000NBVFN2|5|worked perfect
B000C11PYW|1|doesnt seem to help.
B00BD5GVVI|1|Way too small!!!!! I was SO excited to get these and they look absolutely beautiful just as shown above but as soon as I got them and went to my car to put them on it was so upsetting to see they didn't fit correctly. :(
B0023VIVCS|5|Perfect!
B00E867A7I|5|Shipped quickly! It was exactly as pictured and a great quality too!
B000CRHLZ8|5|Item as discribed.
B00J7HBRL8|5|So I bought a pair or a set of ten of pretty much every LED bulb out there to see which one would be brighter for stern area of my boat and these by FAR are the brightest.  Very nice.
B004O45Z9Y|5|On time, great price, very happy.
B00B1EE6YU|5|Fit my car great! Even came with two, in case the other one gets hit by some hail :)
B001CEJH0W|4|Easy install , fits well , smells good !!!
B000AMBNPY|4|It cuts down on the Texas sun beating down on my left side as I drive home from work.  It's a bit smaller than the window but so what, it protects me enough.
B009P7QVJS|3|Wrong part. It says it's for a Harley Davidson Fatboy but doesn't even come close to fitting.
B000GU24HG|2|Ripped pretty delicate. .. but nice
B008427D88|5|Just what we needed
B009OAWSAW|5|Just got my hoodie in the mail! Fits perfect and its very comfy! I haven't gone for a ride yet but I know it will work great! It's easy to move in and I feel like I will have a good amount of protection for the type of riding I do. This hoodie is made very well!
B000BGHYJS|5|Tight seal, does the job without having to work on the old valve.
B00CMUDB6Q|5|Works great!
B00I8IP28G|5|good as the mazda filter
B001RKH7FS|3|doesn't keep items as cold as I'd like
B0058WXNOK|1|Repairs crack, but paint doesn't look too good.
B00O5BC7I8|5|Very sturdy wire terminals.  Make sure you have a tool for crimping these on to the cable.
B0063CU2KW|5|I actually didn't know how this would look since it was on a car, I am used to SUV's but finally got tired of 18-20mpg. I just got a 2016 Elantra and noticed that the hood is getting riddled with everything since it slopes down so much. It installed easily and looks great.... Kinda low profile, but still just enough to push some stuff away from the hood.<br /><br />Edit, I used the existing Hyundai push clips instead of the what came with the carflector. From what others are saying, it sounds like the 2016 has newer clips, they are T shaped on the top and rounded screw like on the bottom, and work perfectly and fit tightly. They pull out easily with needle nose pliers and push back in securely with a good grip, producing NO movement at all.
B0090UN116|4|One pcs is brock. Evretheng is good only one pcs brock
B000JWOPIC|5|A perfect, leak free fit. I use Gold Plug on all my cars.
B00KNPI06I|5|Awesome Fog lights for the price!
B0040CYZK0|1|They wer th wrong size
B00UEABZ3M|2|The helmet quality was fair to poor. The sun visor did not work correctly, one side was not correctly attached the mech. Also the wind visor rattled.<br />It was certainly not the quality that I expect buying it through Amazon.
B00NLQVR4S|5|Snell certified protection for under $150 is a great deal. The pin lock visor is a great feature and the overall construction feels top notch. My hat size is 7.5 inches and a large fits perfectly. This is the only helmet I have where the vents actually make a difference in air flow. The guys at RevZilla do a solid video review of this helmet and that was what convinced me to get it. This saves you from breaking your skull without breaking the bank.
B004ZF3Y40|5|Great hid kit. It is plug and play as advertised. I installed it on a 2010 dodge journey and ordered the computer warning and anti flicker kit. Both work great and looking to order the highbeam and foglight hid kits. Thank you Kensun
B00LX0C8XS|5|Perfect purchase as needed
B00061SMS0|5|I used this to remove the pitman arm on my '02 Ford F150.  I'm very glad I purchased this puller.  It took all I had to get the arm to pop off - a little heat, Air Cat 1150 impact gun, 3' breaker bar,  penetrating oil & time.  I put A LOT of torque on this puller and it handled it fine.  There is no way one of the cheaper pullers would have removed this arm.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.
B0066QWDE8|5|Perfect for my 2004 745
B00KQPOSQ6|5|Exactly what we needed!  Do wish it came with a case as some on EBay do.
B00U21WK3M|4|The frame is fairly cheap plastic, but the mirror itself is good quality. The mirror spins within the frame. Of the two I received, one spins with a bit of effort, the other is loose. For the latter I plan to glue it down - once I am sure of the right viewing angle.
B00FRHOC82|5|Fit like a charm! this fit my 2011 Hyundai Tucson perfectly. it was easy to get on and wipes clean and clear.
B00JQOPQ50|5|Works great once you get it set up. Very safe with the brake lever disconnect. Works well, looks way better than the cheap black plastic of this style.
B009R7W550|5|smooth transaction, as described
B000C9RNPO|5|great quality
B00WZ9ZPPY|5|There is a little up and down slop in the clutch lever, but from what I've read that's about normal. Plus for as inexpensive as these are it isn't a deal breaker
B007T9BTBY|5|No problems with the fitment of this solenoid.  Bolted up as it should and performed like it should.
B00REJXVEW|5|Very nice cover. Fits my 2011 ram 6.5 box perfect
B001G6LRTK|5|Perfect for a civic 1.6 2000 lx distribuitor. No more leaks
B000COCRXM|5|I used these to hold down the lid on my garden tractor. Works perfect!
B006SRAJK0|5|Fit perfect. Glad I didn't have any trouble
B00FBWJXDC|1|I put it on my back window and as I was lifting it the whole thing tore up after I tried it several times I'm not buying from here no more.
B00MB0EDTG|5|Everything they said and awesome price!!!
B000B8U97A|4|Exactly what I needed..
B003123IQW|5|Installed and fit perfectly on 2014 v star 950 tourer.  Looks great!
B00I0L86K2|5|AAA+++ Buying experience!!!
B004TDMJ2Q|4|they're good at everything except the squeal it makes and it disappears for a while when I wash the calipers with water when the rotors are cold but it comes back also I found deep scratches on the rotors caused by the pads. I think the ceramic ones are tougher than metallic on rotors.
B00029XI2Q|5|As advertised and it works great!
B0126A02AO|5|Absolutely great seat covers for the price. The look and feel of the covers were better than expected. If you properly install the covers, there shouldn't be any problems. Great product, awesome value!
B003YLH8KM|5|Nice product,easy install...
B00DCX8I7O|5|Love it!
B00BCRM9YA|5|Fits perfect in my car
B00PHLM4T2|5|Installed it in my Corolla 2010. I had it installed professionally. FYI: I had tints added to my windows (which are 35%) and in addition to this auto dimming rear view mirror, I am not blinded. I still see the cars behind me. This mirror works perfectly by blocking excessive light from headlights. I love the sleek design upgrading the look of my boring Corolla interior. I also enjoy the compass as an additional feature. Very nice!
B00MB0EX46|4|I am a teeny bit disappointed in this product. In the picture it shows the two clips to be fastened at the bottom of the frame. This is specifically when I bought it, but when it came it only had holes for the top of the frame. It is still a nice material and looks great on my Jeep, but beware the picture and product are different.
B0081YSIGA|5|It is awesome for my 2007 versa<br />I have befor the 12smd and now 24smd
B000VSHYEG|5|Fit stock Harley grips. feel great.
B001NJJ94U|5|Smells great
B000VL3RVM|5|Perfect fit. No problem, would purchase again similar product from Amazon. The price was good also.
B0016KJ5MC|5|Seems to be very sturdy.  Takes a little bit to figure it out.  And make sure to take it off before backing up into your campsite.  It makes some weird grinding noises when moving at slow speed and taking tighter turns, but it does stabilize the trailer on the interstate when being passed by a semi.
B001E4E0ZW|1|No POS<br />Broke second day I had it
B005C5E81U|5|Someone stole my 2014 - R6 but the fit was great on my R6 lol so now im partly covering my 2015 - FZ-09 lol It covers all the important things hahha Little expensive but papa wants what papa wants hahah
B001FCB4JS|5|Easy to apply.
B004MDXVRU|4|Does what it's supposed to, very useful product, well made
B00I8X5BMS|4|All pieces were of good quality.  Especially nice that it includes the power valve.  Only issue was the gasket for the needle seat was too small, so I had to reuse the old one.
B0053HCYZY|3|Kinda small
B003U4O414|5|I have a 99 Mercedes with 305,000 miles and it was starting to get a tick. This and the valve cleaner eliminated the problem.
B00F8TRDI0|4|The frame itself is solid. The letters and states are just stickers, but they look pretty good. Happy with my purchase.
B00SSMOS5U|5|The best sunshade EVER! It fits like a glove and really does help keep the car cool.
B001T5C0ZS|3|Good durable product but the design could use some improvement: (1) back waistband rides high and irritates my back. The workaround is to wear cotton underpants beneath and pull that waistband higher than the armor waistband, so your underwear sits as a layer between the scratchy part and your skin.(2) Back of the knees gets irritated. If I ride more than an hour with these, the fabric bunches up behind my knees so I end up with a slight abrasion. A 250 mile trip yielded a callous this way. I think its the synthetic material doing this, so I may sew a thin cotton layer back there to see if it helps. I expected more thought in this department for a $175 product.
B000N3OD9I|5|Just like the original pre filter which came on the ATV, in my case a 1993 Polaris Trail Boss 250 4x4.  Fit was great, decent price and very prompt shipping.  Would buy again-no problems.
B00N30V36Y|5|Good s***
B00BQ03TQ0|5|Great fit<br />easy install
B00BCRMC1U|5|Love it love it love it. I didnt even finish install the hall thing but i already received so many compliments. The quality is better than what i expected. Really recommend it. Fits perfectly on my versa'07
B00RH4ZHL4|5|Works great.
B0007VANJ0|4|Sturdy build.  Easy to install.
B00HESFIJ4|4|Seems pretty good, though one of the gauges (of two) is off by about 2-3 psi.<br /><br />The long tube is convenient, and also the fact that the reading is held after removing the gauge from the tire valve, till you depress the pressure release button.
B0002NYDZ8|5|I must have bought 3 or 4 different ones before I came across this one. All my others simply were a pain when refilling, or would get air in them and not work, a real pain.  This one worked and continues to work without any issues. Great small size for the hard to reach places (I use this on my boat engines where its tight).
B00TOZOPT4|5|Loving my spacers!!!!
B009DJQIIC|5|Arrived as described.  Great price!
B005FIHDNE|5|Great value for this amount.
B005INX0DI|5|PolyDyn's TX7 engine treatment is a no brainer. I use a bottle of this on every oil change. My vehicle is 10 years old with over 180,000 miles on it, and the engine works just as good as the day I bought the car. Not once have I had anything on my motor breakdown. If your looking to keep your vehicle for many years to come, I would recommend using this product.
B007VRCUT4|5|Very clean looking.
B009BEGV6S|5|This really does what the company states. No signal lose with any of the 6 sensors on a 36&#34; rv and constant monitoring works great. Let me know I had a slight leak in one tire; loose valve stem. Great product.
B000C39C6I|5|It is more than it meets the eye. this little fellow works great. It took a couple of tries to get it tuned in but it does a super job controlling the electric fans, yes two of them. I by passed the ignition switch to prevent percolation after shut down. They stay on for  about 12 minutes but no noticeable drain on battery, starts right up. So, it is actually a stand alone cooling system, so far, so good. Getting a second one for my '69 Cutlass. And for the money? can't ask for more.
B00O5MVOYA|5|Great for the price.  You are going to need a razor blade to cut corners after installing.  No other way in my  opinion to make this work.  Looks really good on my 535i side bumper.
B00BQHE4OO|5|Prompt service and proper fit
B000C2EGBA|1|Same as below, too much slack. Had to cut and use RTV as well.
B003TQIIPG|5|EASY, EASY, EASY!!!  Made some planters out of horse troughs for the wife.  Wanted to use something that could handle the Texas heat and weather and prevent rusting.  Worked perfect.  The low flow air gun is NOT reusable but, because its so cheap why would you need to keep it.<br /><br />Would recommended wearing gloves (rubber) to apply if purchased.  Not like paint.  Once its on, ITS ON!!<br />This save me about $400 bucks!!
B000C5CEKC|1|Junk! You'll spend several minutes trying to lock and unlock this cap. Cheap locking device.<br />Came apart once. Pure junk and not worth 10 cents!
B00446YIYK|1|It never has worked.  Bad buy.
B00WNGV0WG|5|Works great in the car for my 4 and 2 year old. Stops them from spilling their snacks and crayons everywhere. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.
B00G5DESZE|5|Ordered two 5 gallon containers for my new log splitter. Filled hydraulic tank and the splitter works great! The cost for the 10 gallons of oil (delivered) was less than 5 gallons at local stores in my area. 5 of 5 stars in my &#34;book&#34;.
B004AIDK50|4|Good fit
B004GD0JOE|5|Perfect fit .. Very happy with everything
B0127BV0A8|5|Put the old battery and PC card into this one.<br />Make sure you assemble it with the hold up so the PC Card seats fully into the rubber cover as you snap the rubber cover into the bottom portion of the shell.<br />If the PC card slips too far toward the ring hole, it will not work properly.<br />Sit in the car, close the door, turn the key on and off twice, quickly.<br />With ALL your key fobs handy, press the lock and unlock buttons on each, in turn until the door locks cycle.<br />You have to sync ALL your key fobs at the same session.<br />There are YouTube videos that also describe the procedure.
B00DDMQHOK|2|not particularly effective did little to desolve the dried on corrosion
B00CIVE9HE|5|Perfect fit.  Looks better than original.
B007KTIO02|5|This is a great product
B0085X4IZM|5|I've used this thing several times on a Ford Explorer, a 4Runner, and now a Dodge Ram 1500. My buddy got a flat last night and I told him I had a small compressor at home but I don't know if it its strong enough, but sure enough it blew it right up so he could get home no problem. Great buy
B000C1QOGQ|5|Perfect fit. Super fast delivery.
B0050SYSRS|4|Works just fine
B00BK879VE|5|great fit, great look.  very securely attached. Im very happy with this purchase so far.
B00WW87O6G|5|Worked perfectly.  Easy to install.
B000EQD4H6|5|Denso is a great product and I would prefer to use Denso wires on all my Honda and Toyota vehicles.  The plug wires came as advertised, were the correct length, and snapped on with no issues.  Great Product with a Great Price!  :)
B00SISDC5Q|5|This is worth the money its super Bright
B00RBIUX2Y|5|looks and works great.
B00L3KDUD0|5|great
B00464GO7O|5|Great service and that is SO important and an unbelievably great product! Love love the wipers!
B00SG3MUOC|5|Just want I needed. Wrks great.
B00YIJT0UK|4|Direct fit.  Be sure to take backing shim off your older inner pad as theses don't come with one.  Went on without a hitch.  Big question now is:  How durable will they be?
B008I7O65C|5|👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
B0009IQXJK|5|good fitler cheap price
