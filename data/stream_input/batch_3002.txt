B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Now You See Me is based on the heist genre. This means the elements on screen will be drifters, magicians who pull off tricks such as robbing banks, entire bank accounts, have disappearing skills and are highly trained and masters of their profession.<br /><br />Firstly, lets talk of Jesse Eissenberg - I don't know why he did this film, he is a complete misfit in this outfit. He is a very intelligent actor and of course the film begins in an interesting tone but half an hour into it, you get this sinking sensation that you have seen the whole film.<br /><br />Woody Harrelson is so 1994 and I'm afraid he can't get out of that mold.<br /><br />The rest of the cast including Freeman and Ruffalo are there just to act like antonyms.<br /><br />Overall, this film is not smart, it is very smug and assuming...<br /><br />If you thought Ocean's 12 was a very good film, you will definitely like this one.<br /><br />But if you like me, believe in the velocity of the punch more than the need to throw one, you will want to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Looking for good similar films? Try \\"The Criminal\\" , \\"Hard Eight\\" , \\"Rounders\\" and \\"The Prestige\\"<br /><br />This film was terribly disappointing because of the very root of it. It's not the acting, it's the story, bad bad story.
B001KZG99A|5.0|I'm glad this was taken care of quickly!  I didn't get the run around on this one! Thanks a bunch, Suzette!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I believe the curse words although few could have been left out however VERY AWESOME!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not done yet but there is a lot of bondige going on not sure the woman is very grown up yet maybe things change when I get more into it
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|I thought his first CD couldn't be topped, but he just keeps getting better. This guy has been blessed with an amazing instrument! If you've never heard him, start from the beginning. You won't be disappointed if you love real talent.
B000000OR9|5.0|It got here quickly and in great shape.  Thanks a bunch, Suzette! It has all that I needed and I've really played it a lot!
B0019NG73G|5.0|I live near Gettysburg and viewing this movie before I visited it during thier 150th Anniversary really provided additional perspective on the ment, personalties, strategy and horror of the three day event. Living in the Mid East gives me a great perspective all the major battles and struggles.
030746363X|5.0|I enjoyed the chapters that I have read so far. It gave me a great understanding of many things. Tim has put himself through many years of experiments so that people like myself can use the benefits.<br /><br />Thank you.
B005NNURES|5.0|One of the more underrated albums of all time.  Honestly, I think &#34;The Wall&#34; is incomplete without &#34;The Final Cut&#34;.  This album kicks ass.
B005R4255C|5.0|This was where I was able to get what isn't available from the regular market.  This has exactly what I was looking for to go along my other CDs from Michael.  Thanks a bunch, Suzette!
B001VNB54A|5.0|As expected a great movie depicting many of the key battles of the Pacific.  It would be great to see a similar movie ( sudo documentary) about Vietnam and maybe even Korea.
B0050DZN4K|2.0|I signed up for free HQ to use Feedler on my iPad iPhone. I can't subscribe to yet another service now. I would use this app if i could sign up via FeedHQ. Then I'll add stars. But for now i cant even use it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it!!!!! A very fun game and tricky. Looking forward to playing more levels..but would like to suggest adding hints.
B0001Z37HM|5.0|It got here quickly and in great shape.  Thanks a bunch, Suzette! I love Arnold in this one, hard to find and for a fraction of the cost, Thanks a bunch, Suzette!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Although I have liked all of Stephen King's books, I really generally like his older books. At least until I started this one and could not put it down! I am a big fan and will continue to wait impatiently for his next book. I really hated to reach the end of this one!
B00F91RYL8|1.0|I was about 30 minutes into World War Z when it became glaringly apparent that the filmmakers were going through great lengths to avoid including blood and violence. Honestly, historically speaking, gore has probably been more important to the zombie genre than story (which is incredibly weak in this movie, anyway). Pitt is terribly unconvincing as a stay-at-home dad that is secretly a badass (and apparently way smarter than the worldwide scientific community). If you genuinely like zombie movies, you will not like World War Z. If you like the book, you'll be disappointed by this movie. Apparently, Brad Pitt is going around saying he wanted this movie to be PG-13, so his kids could see it. That's absolutely untrue. This movie is PG-13, so they could make a profit. It had an incredibly high budget, and they needed it to be more accessible, as to recoup that money. Make no mistake, this is a Brad Pitt vanity project.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Listening on Bose 901 makes you feel like you are there live. Unbelievable talent, didn't know blues can sound that good.
B000002JSN|5.0|This was only 4 dollars and only online impossible at any store anywhere.  Thanks a bunch, Suzette!  Exactly what I was looking for costing less.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|This is really a very good game for anyone who likes mystery or trying to find things in a picture.  There are so many levels to play and the fun is just great!  I would recommend this to others.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This came out while I was preggers with my first. I died laughing. Saw it 3 times in theaters & at least a dozen times since!!<br /><br />LOVE IT!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this app on a regular basis. Solid, well-coded, &amp; well thought out.<br />The ads are discreet &amp; not at all obnoxious.<br />Thanks for your work!
B000000OQ5|5.0|For a fraction of the cost and in perfect condition factory sealed!  Amazon.com carries so much great music not usually found in the stores from a band I've haven't heard in so long!  Thanks a bunch, Suzette!
B009JZWO3I|4.0|The good wife has consistently been a great series each and every season. I'm looking forward to season five for sure!
B001DE29SS|5.0|I love this movie. I have from the first time I watched it. This movie made me a Robert Downey Jr. Fan and introduced me to Chaplin. Since the first time I watched it I have watched Chaplin's films and read his autobiography which this is partially based on. An interesting story behind a cinematic genius.
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|I purchased a DVD a couple years ago for a road trip for me kids but they may have been too young to enjoy it. Now, we all love this movie so much! Its a cute story line, the actors are know and add their personalities to these animated characters, and it cracks us all up!<br /><br />We had it recorded on our DVR since we misplaced the DVD, but it accidentally got deleted. My youngest was throwing such a rant and wanted to watch it one day that I had to rent it on Amazon just to get him to calm down. $2.99 is a small price for happiness.
B000AO4NJA|5.0|This is replacing an old cassette for a fraction of the cost and has exactly what I was looking for.  It got here well packaged and very quickly in the condition described!  Thanks a bunch, Suzette!
B005IA9JZO|5.0|I LIKE HOOK BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD MOVIE. I RECENTLY PURCHASED IT FROM AMAZON.COM VIA MY INTERNET COMPUTER DESKTOP.
1423141997|5.0|My son just love this Author, he love read his books!<br />Great job Rick Riordan for keep my son entertained
B002RMVAZ8|1.0|I didn't watch because it wasn't the version I was looking for. Looking for the Mel Gibson version.  Maybe watch this one later.
B001HN69B8|5.0|I'm glad this is on Blu-ray.  it works great, it replaces an old copy.  This was also in the best condtion as expected.  Thanks, Suzette!
076780421X|5.0|Matt Perry and Salma Hyek what a pair in this movie, I could watch it over and over again. Salma's Mexican heritage is wonderful in the movie, loved it all.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I love Chers new cd. Its great to dance to and it puts me in a good mood . I really love the song Womans World!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|While written for young adult - this is a must read for everyone !  Beautifully written !  Exceptional story telling page turning writing !  Any unusually easy read for such a painful story !
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Good show. I think it is very clever. Lawyers can sure twist things to make it work for them! A definite watch.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|Jake and Ann are wonderful in this movie, so sexy the both of them. Lots of nudity if your into that.
B009KWU6Q2|2.0|I rated it 2 stars do too, sound for this movie was poor.  I kept having to turn it up and down.. either to soft or too loud.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|it is nice and i used it and i put it to use after I used and its a lot of words 15 lame
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|God bless America. Myles, Mark, Scott and Brian really blew this album out of the park. I didn't even know they were scheduled to release another album and what a gift. Myles aways brings it home with the lyrics and Mark just tears it up on the guitar. I have to say Cry of Achilles really rocks to start off with but my favorite song is Waters Rising with Mark and Myles on the vocals. Those two are just badasses and I hope they continue to produce kick ass albums like this. All their other albums are worth getting too if you don't have them already. :)
B000ZHCQ5U|1.0|This is the worst movie that I have ever seen.  I don't particularly care for Peter Sellers but he was adequate in the movie.  The other actors I enjoy but not here.  I had to watch it for a class assignment.  Otherwise I would not have made it beyond the first five minutes.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed the book, however I thought it was disjointed.  Also did not understand the necessity of Marcos story in Greece.  It just didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the subject.  Discussed it in our Book Club & everyone agreed. It did show the love & also guilt & jealousy among the sisters.  All in all it was enjoyable.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|I liked this movie.  Will Smith wrote it and his son starred in it.  I don't analize movies.  I watch them for their artistic point of view.  This movie was given a bad rap just like John Carter.  Everyone is entilted to their opinion.  I respect that.  This is mine.  Original plot, story and face it; father and son team.  If you put yourself into the movie and the characters you'll see that it was a good movie.  A young man trying to be like his father, a war hero and savior of the human race.  A 15 year old boy having to become a man to save the life of  his dad, survive in a hostile environment and overcome his fears and prove to himself that he can do the things that he believed that he can do.  I liked it and I'll watch it again.
B000035P5E|5.0|Donald Sutherland is great and as a spy during WWII gets his reward. This could have been based on actual events too.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Great book! I really like this author. She does a good job of taking you through the Cathys journey. I enjoyed this book so much, I went on to read Human Remains.
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins is precise and systematic in his breakdown of religion and the perils that come with it. I recommend this to atheists as well as &#34;on the fence&#34; believers. If ever there were something to persuade you to the side of science and reason, it would be this book. Absolutely wonderful!
B00BATWJFE|4.0|Quick, enjoyable read. Graeme has a way of creating characters that are endearing. Also, a nice glimpse into the adult ASD world and how, even if wired differently with limited social or intimate abilities, it demonstrates the value in us all.
B000AP04L0|5.0|This is an absolutely HILARIOUS, multi-layered movie with the best casting in the world!  Peter Gibbons plays a man with a job in a cubicle who hates his job.  One night he is professionally hypnotized to feel completely laid back and unworried about consequences for his actions.  Before he can be snapped out of it, the hypnotist keels over from a heart attack.  To say the least, Peter only goes in the office when he feels like it and many very funny events arise from this.  His boss, Mr. Lumberg, is hilariously played by a stodgy Gary Cole who couldn't be better in his role (WHO hasn't mimicked Lumberg who has seen this movie?).  The list of characters and their side stories goes on and on with more and more laughs (such as Peter's next door neighbor in his apartment who just yells through the walls to talk to him).<br /><br />Can't recommend this movie highly enough because I know you will love it.  It is worth it for the scene with Peter and his co-workers taking baseball bats and sledge hammers to one of the copy machines that is always breaking!  Try it....you won't regret it!
B005MYEPXC|1.0|Movie was not right could not play til the end..very disappointing.According to guidelines..I must write 9 more words..Will not buy another movie online
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I like Castle and set is great. I wish you had all the seasons available. Everyone should buy this set.
B003XURDAY|5.0|Just thinking about the sequel they're going to make made me want to buy this fantastic movie that Ridley Scott directed.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A biographical account of all that can go wrong within the justice system.  Chilling in that it raises the questions of nature versus nurture in an unique context.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A story of a teen-age girl, abandoned and alone, finding kinship with a 91 year old woman. Their paths very different, but with the same loneliness and heartache. Their friendship teaches them both about who they are.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The book was multi-faceted...I learned so much about flowers and their meaning; however, the story also was multi-faceted, including foster care experiences, relationship experiences, psychological issues and how people came together eventually to make it all work for this extraordinary woman.
0061801313|4.0|I ordered the books from Mexico and they arrived before I expected them, that was a really nice detail, but the box and the books were a little damaged. Still I appreciate the package because the price was great and the conditions were fair.<br />The books are small and easy to read and I highly recommend them to anyone, especially if you are into the pretty little liars tv show. I feel like there's a lot of people complaining about the contents of the books and I have to say that yes, the subjects that are talked in the books are strong but nothing that it's not actually happening among the teenagers, so it felt real.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|Hi, I'm Squirrelflight, the deputy of ThunderClan. I recently downloaded this game on my Kindle Fire (that I took from some Twolegs, shh) Anyhow, this game could be better, such as multiplayer mode on the free version. Another bit of mousedung about it, is that the other paddle will do this weird rapping thing with the puck. Fun game however. It's a great way to pass time when I'm not organizing patrols or hunting.<br />Oh Bramblestar's calling me! May StarClan light your path.<br />:)
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Great follow up to The Secret.  Simple chapters that offer practice and deeper explanation of &#34; the secret&#34;. I found myself happier daily
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing and i love it when it gets harder to do and the game pace gets faster and i get alot of coins
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was not sure what to expect from this book as it had such mixed reviews but I found<br />myself laughing and thinking how witty Ana is as well as Christian. Very well written and an intriguing love story.
B00F52YOPA|3.0|It's okay as a time passer. I've had some trouble on the technical side, at one point I had to start over because the game would not advance. I went to level 83 and it just wouldn't load. But otherwise than that it's simply okay.
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|What can you say, It is a classic of all times.  There is not a better Rock and Roll album.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This  is the best game ever but a lot of hats to put on your shark  cost gems which you have to pay for with real money.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|When I received my CD of Earth Wind, @ Fire group it was so wonderful to listen to over and over. I have always liked Earth, WIND, @ Fire group since 1972 and bought there albums, CD and went to the concert when they came to my town too. The group is the best group from the 70's threw now with this CD now.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Now I can't wait to see the movie! I wasn't going to get the other books in the series but now I think I will.
B004J4X73K|4.0|I don't know if this is the last book. I could spend a lot of time with these guys. Good book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was fun. Though I wish the items you need to unlock certain characters weren't so<br /> large. It also needs more. Different things to interact with in game.
B004TI5N38|5.0|David Baldacci never disappoints.  Once I start reading, I can't put it down.  I love his characters in each novel.
B000TU16GS|5.0|This book was one of the best book I ever read because theirs suspension and best of all action .
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|The best hunting game I've played in my long search for a good one seriously I love it<br />I will be playing this forever
B003XVYLDU|5.0|A literary classic that really doesn't require anymore analysis at this point in its life.  Wonderfully written with fantastic characters.  If you haven't read this, put it at the top of your list.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|the new update makes the screen kinds lags and slow when shifting between tracks, makes it very difficult to play will give more stars when fixed.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Although I have not yet finished this book, I have a hard time putting it down! Like the first book, I really get into the scenes if you will. Excellent reading!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is a perfect scifi thriller. The characters are wonderful and rich. Loved the rest of the series as well
B0011XBLUS|5.0|My favorite western!<br />Nothing else comes close to this. This is Eastwood at his best.<br />Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef provide the perfect chemistry.<br />Ennio Marricone did a superb job on the musical score...overall a timeless classic!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. You can do whatever you want with your world. I haven't experienced any bugs. The graphics are as minecraft as it gets.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoyed The Hunger Games.  It held me captive from beginning to end.  I sorry I did not see the movie when it came out but I'm glad I could watch it on Amazon Prime.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This series is unbelievable, not just only for the excellent acting of all the cast, but the well worked story that make you astonished chapter after chapter. It's not the same genre as Fringe but it's equal in thrilling and captive me for the next season and made me a fan of this one. Congratulations to Kevin Space an Robin Wright, your the best in the series.
B00BMR4RIG|1.0|Does not keep up with other cities you try to put Melbourne it gets some other city ...poor. also the layout is poor and tried to sell other app despite stating add free

B004I744AS|5.0|I love this app very much, it is useful and real funny with all the options at your disposal. I recommend it
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This movie was in perfect condition. I had seen Avatar at the theater and the 3D was amazing, so when i got a new 3D TV I wanted to test it out but, the 3D was no where close to how i seen it in the theater. But I love the movie and have watched it several times.

B009LXEBD4|5.0|She is the original American Idol and proves the success of the show.  This CD doesn't have any bad songs on it.  So if you like her, you will love this CD.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE HER MUSIC!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was the best book in the entire world<br />I thought it was just perfect and beautiful I fell in love
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Very helpful....a must read! Easy to read and understand. An invaluable tool to help you self publish!  Five Star for sure!
B006LSZECO|3.0|What started out as a great story that I could not put down, had an extremely unsatisfying ending.  It seemed Flynn just gave up because she couldn't decide how to end it!  I was so mad, I wouldn't pick up another book for almost a week!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I would like fewer to no ads and easier navigation to todays hourly forecast.  I know, I know, its free.
159463176X|4.0|Thia gifted writer did not quite match his Kite Runner but was another exploration of his talents for probing the minds and hearts of his characters.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Like the original Self-Portrait, Another Self-Portrait has many songs that will never rate high in the Dylan canon, including a lot of covers that are interesting largely because Dylan clearly considered them influences on his own work. The same cannot be said, IMHO, for the outtakes/alternative versions of several of the stellar Dylan compositions on New Morning, such as Sign on a Window, Time Passes Slowly, and the demo of I Went to See the Gypsy. Like the alternative versions from the NY sessions of Blood on the Tracks, these performances rank at the same high level as the \\"official\\" releases, and give new insights into the emotions, and genius, from which they sprang. It is wonderful that these compositions have now been given a chance to live and breathe in the world, with the others. For me that makes the album well worth having, even at a two-disc price. More casual Dylan fans, however,  might still do better to focus on acquiring other Dylan albums that are clearly more essential to the canon.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|Great movie.  Interesting for people older than six as well.  Flynn is hilarious.  I would definitely watch it again.  Ponies.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|All of my favorite JBJ songs in one album, and for $5. Can't beat a deal like that. Love it.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|i am now ruined for any other author on historical romance this book was the best of the great series
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like it . It nice that I can do every thing on my phone or my kindle . Thanks
B008RA3X5E|1.0|The clock never has the right time.  It's only purpose is to be the gateway to sell you a different app.  It's being deleted as soon as possible...
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love having the app, although too easy to search and spend my money. However it is extremely handy when my girls are explaining some item and we can look that up right away.
1479159778|3.0|I like the large letters but there are typos in the boob which is annoying. Besides, if the cover is colorful, the book will be more enjoyable. It is understandable to have the authors picture on the the cover but her appearance is not as facinating as her writing. I would rather see the beautiful characters on the cover.
B003UESJ9W|5.0|I remember that I ruled out having any interest in seeing this movie when I saw the trailer in the theaters, as I'm not a country music fan.  However, I just happened to run across it when it came on one of our premium movie channels, and I decided to give it a shot.  First off, I'll offer that the \\"country\\" music in the movie is done - in my opinion - in a style that is at least half-way toward pop music, allowing it to appeal to those who aren't country music fans.  From a marketing perspective, this is pure genius - I absolutely love the soundtrack of songs played in the movie (side note: the music in the movie is spread out over TWO sound track CDs, sold separately, and all the songs on those CDs that are NOT in the movie are truly, purely country music).  As for the movie, wow - it blew me away - it was entertaining with the music, but has a serious and dark element to it as well.<br /><br />A few words about the cast.  I won't comment on the characters, so as to not give any of the plot away, but I will discuss the actors/actresses.  Tim McGraw - it's really hard to not like Tim - he just has a natural charisma about him, no matter what kind of person the character he plays is.  Gwyneth Paltrow - the movie's main character - she's tremendously talented, as her many accolades attest to, and SHE SINGS - no voice-overs or lip synching in this movie!!!  Leighton Meester - I would consider her the converse of Gwyneth in this movie, in that Gwyneth is a great actress who can sign well, Leighton is a very good singer who can act well.  I really like Leighton in this movie; she got to flex her acting skills more in the movie than any other in which I've seen her, especially the ability to show vulnerability in a very convincing way.  Garrett Hedlund - in my humble opinion, Garrett stole the show!  He can not only act well (also showing genuine vulnerability), he can sing country music as well as anybody out there.  (As I watched the movie the first time, I wondered whose voice Garrett was lip synching over, only to learn that he was actually doing the singing himself!)  Apart from the solo's in the movie, he and Leighton did a duet of the first half of Garth Brooks' Friends in Low Places, which I really, really like (no disrespect to Garth - he's a legend - but his version is a bit two twangy for me in how he sings it).  Unfortunately, this song does not appear on either of the two soundtracks; despite that, this movie is a treasure trove of great songs.<br /><br />One bit of warning: this is not a glitz at the top of show business, rah rah, feel-good type of movie.  It has some really good acting and very good singing/music in it, and the plot moves very well.  However, at its core, it is a serious movie that reflects on some of life's greatest joys and most painful realities.<br /><br />In sum, I loved this movie - one of my all-time favorites.  If you get it, I hope you will enjoy it as well!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I could only have improved over time.<br />Should have had at least 3 seasons.<br />It was cancelled way too soon.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|The characters were portrayed very well and the plot was exceptionally well structured, with surprises at many points.  Would strongly recommend it for viewing.
B0057VY45O|5.0|A good pilot episode... I think I am gonna be hooked on this series. I have been putting this off for quite some time but today finally decided to give it a try.. and I am glad that I did. If this pilot episode is any indication of what is about to come than I am sure I am in for some lawyer entertainment :)
0321934318|5.0|I can't imagine slogging through Lightroom without this book. Very clearly written.<br /><br />Should be useful to both amateurs and pros.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I really enjoyed Twenty eight and a half Wishes. It was just plain fun, although I did have some issues with it. It was mostly a light and hilarious read, so when the emotional bits came, I was surprised at the power of it. I loved the heroine, Rose, and her growth throughout the book. She had no trouble saying what she thought, and I was so proud of her I wanted to clap.<br /><br />&#34;Rose, are you alright?&#34; His voice softened.<br />It made me cry even harder.<br />&#34;No.&#34;<br /><br />Can't express how awesome this was. I can't tell you how many times the heroine says &#34;I'm fine&#34;, &#34;I'll be ok&#34; when they're usually not. This was refreshing to read.<br /><br />I loved Joe, except when he gets friggin mood swings. It gets explained why he does this later on, but the way he completely shuts off Rose sometimes frustrated me. He also can't seem to find the right words when they have a fight and says &#34;Let me explain&#34;, but he never does while they fight, he's too slow and keeps letting Rose get away. -_-<br />- However, Rose isn't afraid to back down or hesitate to give her own sweet revenge, so this did not bother me much. And for the first time, her dating another guy at some point in the book (which usually sends me the indecisive/fickle heroine signals) made me so happy!<br /><br />Since book 3 has scared me*, I will probably only read stand alone books from this author, if she has any, because I really love how she paced the romantic development. This one was such a solid read, and best of all, it was free. I recommend it to anyone looking for a light-hearted read, with mystery and romance thrown in the mix :)<br /><br />-----<br /><br />* I have read a book 3 spoiler which made me really sad and decide not to emotionally invest myself further in the series
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|This is a GREAT game. I loved it, but beat it in a day. If it had more levels I would give this 5 stars.
B003D0E3FM|5.0|This was Star wars back in the day! And who doesn't love Robbie the robot and Leslie Nielsen as a leading man.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game soooooo much. Its very fun and I play every day when I get home from school
6304666799|5.0|I show this to my Dance Appreciation classes at the college where I teach.  The students love watching it because of the variety of the choreography.
B00439MV42|5.0|I love all 3 movies just waiting too get the 2nd one and the end of the month cant wait
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Good performances, each episode grabs you and engages with the following. Good performances, each episode grabs you and hooks up with the following. Series production is first level.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|Easy to use, nice features like emailing from the app.  If you know how to use Office, you can use this.  I needed a word processor on the android tablet for my elementary school child and didn't want to buy Office.  This really did the trick and had many more features than what I expected for a free app.
0738212415|5.0|I bought this for my 14 year old son and he loved it. The book came in the condition as advertised and on time. I recommend this seller and this book.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Problem is there is no skip button for the tough ones.  Otherwise a fun game.  Fun for all  ages and makes you think.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Wonderful cast of actors and actresses, good script and great stories. The narrative is fast and entertaining, as well as the secondary story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is cool and better than subway surfers.it is like subway surfers and temple run .I also love the outfits and the minions.
0316010669|5.0|Besides The Secret.  THis book is fantastic and wonderful reading material.  I finished in two days.  I couldn't put it down.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've always liked his southern lawyer depictions. This comes at me from a completely different angle: a black lawyer in prison. I'll leave it at that for a tease and no spoilers. This book is page turner from the gitgo. If you like Grisham you'll love this.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I enjoyed it very deeply. It was kind of repetitive when the new armies kept popping up when they needed them, but I liked it all the same. I was upset when it ended. Okay ending.
0061537969|5.0|I loved this novel.  I don't usually read fiction, but on the urging of my friends tried this book.  It was wonderful.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|I love love love it and at such a great price. It has most of my favorite songs. And a couple i hadnt really listened to before but now like.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have been a fan of heavy rock since its inception (and before in its forerunner incarnation vis a vis &#34;boogie woogie&#34; and Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard), so I find it very comforting to see hard rock alive and well with Green Day.  My three favorite cuts here are American Idiot, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and Jesus of Suburbia (a true rock classic).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The story and characters are so interesting as a family and the servants. These are the yesterdays of a time really gone by. The class system and class within class is so different from today in the USA. The series has a way of drawing one into the individual lives of these people. I have enjoyed this series so much. So anxious to see #4.
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|awesome action packed movie - have watched it so many times and still love it. I dig deneros performance - itbis sad to see these awesome grow old and I don't feel when have anyone with that calibre
B003008RWA|5.0|My children loved this movie, also, their eyes are open, widely now.  They see the world differently. My children asked me, for the first time, what the Government shutdown is about; I told them, the relationship between the Government shutdown, Obama Care and what the movie was about.<br /><br />Now my kids promise, to watch the news.<br /><br />Thank you Micheal Moore<br /><br />Safia Mohamed
B003ES61EE|5.0|I like that the lens cleaner nub can be reversed between a large and small width.  This is a basic must for all digital cameras.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|Was looking for a compilation and this fit the bill. Second song seems out of sinc with the others. Would have liked an additional song from Final Cut.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|love love love it<br /><br />get this book it is so good because it has so much action and it is for all people
B00D3LA71K|4.0|I have not been a fan of Matthew in much that he has done but in this instance I thought he performed brilliantly in his role as an on the run killer who befriends two young boys in the backwoods. I particularly liked both of the actors who played the boys Mud befriends as they both really believed that love and marriage is for ever and they couldn't understand why it was a normal course of events that in their neighbourhood it was far from that and they could see why Mud had killed as a result of the disrespect his long-time girlfriend had received at the hands of this thug type in Texas which had now caused his running with the father of the guy killed pursuing Mud with a group hell bent on returning the favor.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|This monitor is very small and non-intrusive, so small that I have almost lost it a couple of times. It works for me just as advertised.
B00CF0ETBE|5.0|This is one of those recordings that you will listen over and over; there are songs that you may have never hear before like The Beatles' &#34;Blackbird&#34;.<br />Just buy it you will not be dissapointed.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Kept my children's interest, and mine! They love the books, and the movie was not a disappointment. Very enjoyable. We will watch it again!
B008GJV2OA|5.0|Amazing film. So much funnier now that I know Slim Pickens was unaware the movie was black comedy. Peter Sellers is at his best.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I was disappointed in the book.  It was slow and hard to keep reading.  I probably would have stopped reading it if it didn't have so many good reviews.  The only good thing I liked was the epilogue where I  told you all the what if.  Wouldn't recommend this to a Friend.
B00E1SM5UA|5.0|If you really are a Beatle fan, you'll be surpised by Al Di Meola's work on their songs. He really did an unbelievable work and the arrangements are perfect.<br />This is a MUST HAVE for those who like The Beatles.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like the variations in the hidden object searches,  I did have one issue.  I started the game, then down loaded another game from G5 and it cleared out all of the stats that I had earned.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Love this series and have since the very first episode! I have a feeling this will have a long run like Friends did with 10 seasons. I am looking forward to the direction that this show will take. If you have not started this series you should and you will not be disappointed!
0307352153|5.0|This is a must-read for any interovert, or extrovert! Very well thought-out, informative and insightful. Great for teachers and parents.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|My 17 yr old daughter and I watched this movie together and she never watches t.v. or movies! We were on the edge of our seats the entire movie. Luckily I had read one famous reviewers review of the film which inspired me to rent it. Will and especially his son were awesome.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|This movie really sucks.  The movie is way too long and by the time it really becomes a little iteresting I completely had lost interest.  Even watched it again to see if ot was better knowing the twist and it wasnt any better.  Booooo Tom Cruise.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|Awesome book! Enjoyed this one a lot. From the first page to the last. Couldn't put it. down! Great !
B00F0XATY4|5.0|The sound quality is great. The songs are a pleasure to listen to, often having more spunk than their studio counterparts. This is a live set you hit play and let play.<br /><br />A fine addition to any fan of The Band...  all the more fantastic since I didn't even know it was out there.
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|It was one of the worst reads I've done for any book club.  I'm sorry to say that I was the person who selected it.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|This movie is a great mix of comedy and action.  I love Bruce Willis.  His acting just gets better with age.  Mary Louise Parker plays her stereotypical self hut it works well in this movie.  I am antipating Red 2.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This is another exciting Mitch Rapp adventure based in Afghanistan and surrounded by current events of today. The chief of CIA operations in Afghanistan has been kidnapped and Mitch is assigned to find him quickly with no holds barred. Mitch's mentor, Hurley, even helps on this job. Ironically Hurley has been diagnosed with terminal cancer.<br /><br /> My thoughts and prayers are with Vince Fynn's family and may you RIP Vince. Thank you for all the Rapp adventures.
0792839749|5.0|came quick and all sealed like expected.  have always loved this movie,  very happy,  and my 3 year old son actually loves it,  well he loves the songs
B0017VG66I|5.0|One of my most favorite gun fights is the climax of Shane. The guns sound real and I have always loved how the movie builds up to that intense situation. Also, Jack Palance moved like a hungry predator in the movie. What a cool bad-guy.<br />Lee Marvin steals the show with his performance as Liberty Valance. The movie is old fashion fun, but the story about how media turns fiction into truth still wrings true today.<br />These are classic Westerns that deserve to be seen by younger generations so that they can appreciate good story telling over special affects.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|I love Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man.  I loved 3.  Watched over and over.  I wish I had purchased it instead of renting.  Iron Man rocks.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Good story and well written.  Enjoyed the honesty and human struggle to discover self and priorities in life.  A good read.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Love this movie......still makes me smile every time I watch it. Patrick is is awesome and is missed. Love him
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Classic Stephen King!  Beautifully written, scary as he'll but still ends leaving a tear in your eye.  King gives good horror.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|This movie truly takes you back in time.  It wss really a good story and great actresses.  I loved it in regards to the racial segregation and abuse.  I think it was a great representation of the racism that America has overcome.  It is a must watch.  Definately a great one to purchase.
B00FEJIVRQ|5.0|I like Robert Downey Jr and got what I thought with this movie.  It was mindless fun, exciting and funny.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|This app is truly fun. It creates some beautiful designs in beautiful colors. The longer you keep your finger on the screen, the more<br />the designs grow and become real interesting and so fantastic. Kids would love this too.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Pretty cool game keeps me coming back. Good help in the beginning to help you start<br /><br />Fun and addictive.. Love that you are playing real time people
B00F91SCXC|4.0|This moviebwas engaging and was a really good movie.  I had no idea it was a zombie movie, which I am not into.  But it was a great action movie with drama and suspense.  I will definately consider owning it.
B00DJ735KI|5.0|This book is very informative and written for anyone to grasp. You do not have to understand or like biology  to read this book. I highly recommend this book as it will change how you perceive the makeup of humans and how our genes do NOT run our life. We can change and for the better! No longer should you blame who you are by your genes and think that you are doomed.
B009X01C64|5.0|I love this leather carrying case for my Kindle Fire.  It's easy to carry, lets me read more hands free and is so easy to use.  It is a bit more bulky than some but it didn't put me off.  Keeps my Kindle from damage, too.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|An already great story gets a few more twists and the obstacles facing Tony Stark seem overwhelming. Then the core of who Iron Man is really gets to shine in a truly awesome battle of epic proportion. This movie was my favorite of the latest Iron Man series and I would recommend it to anyone who is even remotely interested, you will not be disappointed!
B0021L8V0W|5.0|Action packed. Jolie does a great job. She is buff and tuff. A must see if you like action! Get it.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|It is hard to understand Chaplin's role in making the movies the Art form they became.  Robert Downey is excellent in displaying the many dimensions of Chaplin.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Love Chris Pine. He's a wonderful actor but he's great as Captain Kirk, in fact all the cast was very well chosen.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I love this app. It helps alot with making pictures i can do cool effects with timer cam awesome job
B009WUBERW|3.0|It wasn't that good of movie it was a star studded cast of actors and good action but I feel like a lot of the actors are just getting too old for this type of movie
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Good app for a quick check on the weather to start the day. And a gives a lot of information at your fingertips. Offers you the chance to check on other locations.<br />.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love this application!!! What more can I say...<br />Love the alarm options!!! Sooo easy to set alarms!<br />I highly recommend this application!
B0066WJLU6|2.0|I would give this app a 5 star IF the LED light worked. The regular light is brighter than most of the other flashlight apps and it works great, but it is called &quot;Flashlight HD LED&quot; why even call it that if it doesn't work? It's just another app claiming to do way more than it actually can. If the LED light worked and was brighter than the regular light I would change this review to a 5 star rating. I hate when apps advertise false information just so they'll get your personal information.
B009GQ57ES|3.0|The album is okay but, can get boring after the singles. The group seemed to run out of material to be honest. I know they stand up for great causes through their music but, some of the slower songs are just boring.
B007XNTDPA|4.0|It is easy to read these books on Boone, but they have deeper underlying meanings. All ages can read them. This one raises the whole issue of being blamed for something you didn't do, and the ramifications. Well worth a look.
0670026557|5.0|\\"Give and Take\\" is an extraordinary book that proves through examples that otherish givers are more successful than takers, matchers, and selfless givers.  Otherish givers give in a way that avoids burnout (meaning they don't give to the point that they are a doormat), they trust but verify first, they become matchers in their exchanges with takers, etc.<br /><br />At first it may appear givers do not get ahead in business. However, Adam Grant proves with his numerous examples that, in the end, supreme givers like Adam Rifkin and Peter Audet are extremely successful. The author also proved this in his classroom at Wharton through a giving exercise called the Reciprocity Ring. He had each student make a request to the class asking for help and they in turn would try to use their knowledge, resources, and connections to help fulfill that request. What he found is that many successful alliances were formed. For instance, one student received valuable advice from an ex-CEO of Six Flags about his hope of running a Six Flags of his own.  What these experiments also showed is that the act of giving puts others in the mood to give, which is why Freecycle is thriving.<br /><br />Adam Grant proves his case and does so with a clear writing style very similar to the way Malcolm Gladwell writes in his books [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]], [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]], and [[ASIN:0316017930 Outliers: The Story of Success]].<br /><br />I've always been a person with a \\"how can I help you attitude\\" and believe wholeheartedly in the \\"otherish\\" giver approach.  A colleague of mine recommended this as an excellent read and I am glad I took his advice. What a gem of a book this is!
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you love puzzles then this is the game for you! I love it!!! It is very fun I recommend this game
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|Classic, everyone should see this movie at least once in their lifetime, if you watch it once you'll watch it again.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I hate fast zombies. Dead muscles shouldn't be able to move quickly. With that said, \\"World War Z\\" is one terrific movie. The zombies are more like a raging body of red ants, swarming over everything. This is an epic tale.<br /><br />The film works on many levels. The zombie attack is vicious and fast with landscapes full of the crazed creatures. The world is overwhelmed in a day or two. The sequences of attacks are overwhelming. Into this mix is the personal story of our hero Gerry Lane, played perfectly by Brad Pitt, and his family. Can Gerry figure out how to defeat the disease? Or is mankind doomed?<br /><br />I put this one right up there with the top five zombie movies of all time: Shaun of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead (both versions), Night of the Living Dead (both versions.<br /><br />By the way, I also loved the book but this movie is not the book. Doesn't matter, it stands proudly on its own.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a great, quick read that completely wrapped me up in the characters.  Loved how the author wove the stories together to  become one.  Would definitely recommend if you need a good escape book.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|The game is very good but it is the older version and I would love to come out and version 1.1.0 please!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really like the variety, and the free downloadable puzzles. At first I thought you only received the one puzzle, but you get at least 3 per puzzle type. Very nice.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I love reading fiction about other countries. This is the first timeI have read a novel about North Korea. Adam Johnson mixes reality and fantasy seamlessly in his depiction of this hidden society. While I don't usually like novel the employ the techniques of magical realism I felt these techniques perfectly mirror the incredible quality of life in this repressive society.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|A lot more interesting than Walking Dead and not as melodramatic. Good zombie effects. Lot's of total mayhem and good action.
B001706I5I|5.0|Jim is at it again, n this time he's the, GRINCH!!!<br /><br />Jim is funny, n his voice is wicked cool, n his lil dog too mwhahahahahahaha!!!
B009CF7GRY|1.0|I could not even make it past the first 30 minutes.  What a horrible way to pay tribute to a fantastic original.  In this case, &#34;Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.&#34; is no where near the mark.  Pass.
B00471Z3CI|1.0|Horrifyingly horrible. Is this a comedy or a romance film? I couldn't figure it out. You won't catch we watching a sequel if there were.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|All the comparisons to 1984 seem well justified, and perhaps I am fixating on only a portion of Eggers' overall message, but the concept of choice was fundamental in \\"The Circle,\\" in particular how humanity could conceivably be manipulated into behaving nobly by eliminating the viability of doing otherwise.  Burgess' \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" dealt with the frightening ramifications of removing human choice in a more powerful and affecting manner, to the extent that \\"The Circle\\" can be construed as an attempt to modernize Burgess' work.  For anyone who is considering \\"The Circle\\" but has not yet read \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" I suggest the latter.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|It's kind of small but, my son will love on christmas he loves legos and minecraft its a great product!
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|I live in a small town in north eastern Arizona and it can find me. It was easy to install. I didn't give it 5 stars because to me that would imply that it's perfect.
0553593714|5.0|This is THEEE BEST series I have ever read and I could never imagine my world without it ever since I started it.  For anyone starting the series you are ever so lucky to have found it now because there are 5 books you can read back to back and devour.  The 6th is coming soon, so if YOU are lucky you'll be ready for it when you're done with the 1st 5.<br />It's become an alternate universe for me and for my A Song of Ice and Fire book club friends.<br />I have reread A Storm of Swords 3 times and I recently did a Mash up reread of A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons (they're actually set in the same time frame). It's an addiction to theorize, muse, opine and discuss what is happening, what's happened and what is to come.  You will laugh, cry, rage and THINK about this series.  It's not just a Magical Medieval land, it's a trip!<br />You might feel like Alice having fell down the rabbit hole here...<br />Enjoy and welcome, see you beyond the wall.
B000XXLY6I|5.0|I ordered a half-size down like all the other comments said to (I wear 11, ordered 10.5) and they fit perfectly!  Great boot. Comfortable right out if the box.
B00FN811SY|5.0|HOORAY!  JW Library is now available for your Kindle Fire.  I installed it on my first edition Fire and it runs just fine, except for KIT, as noted below.  I am leaving the comments on sideloading, in case they might prove helpful to someone in the future. In the meantime, we can now enjoy this fine Bible study app that contains multiple translations, extensive footnotes and references, plus a plethora of additional helpful information. And there is the promise of a constantly expanding library that may include other languages in the future.  Further, it is all for free and always will be!<br /><br />FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE: (the substance of my original comment)<br /><br />How to sideload JW Library. The procedure is not for the faint of heart nor the computer novice.  It involves 3 steps: (1) Preparing your Kindle; (2) getting the needed files; and (3) completely installing the app. You also need some software tools: a large file share service (such as DropBox), a file explorer (such as ES File Explorer or PowerGrasp), and possibly a root explorer (such as Root Explorer). However, BE WARNED, you may mess things up on your Kindle, so please understand that you do this at your own risk!<br /><br />STEP 1: Prepare your Kindle.  By default, Amazon turns off the ability to sideload apps. To turn it on, click on the \\"gear\\" symbol in the upper right of your screen to get \\"Settings\\", click on \\"More\\", and then scroll down to \\"Device\\". Scroll down to \\"Allow Installation of Applications From Unknown Sources\\" and turn it ON.<br /><br />STEP 2: Get the needed files. Another reviewer noted that you can use the \\"1 Mobile Market\\" app to do so. This is only partially correct, and it does have some \\"gotchas\\". When you install the \\"1 Mobile Market\\" app, it will try to update all your apps, including the built-in Amazon apps, such as the Kindle Reader. DO NOT ALLOW IT TO UPDATE BUILT-IN APPS! Also, \\"1 Mobile Market\\" can only install part of the app. It does give you the 2013 NWT, but not the other Bibles.<br /><br />A cleaner installation can be made by obtaining all of the files from a successful installation of JW Lib on another android device and then transferring the files to your Kindle Fire. (Please see note 2 below regarding one way to do this.)<br /><br />There are two files that are needed to install the complete JW Lib app. They are: \\"org.jw.jwlibrary.mobile-1.apk\\", and \\"main.59.org.jw.jwlibrary.mobile.obb\\". (Note: \\"59\\" is merely the current number of the OBB file as of the time of writing this review [18 Nov 2013]. It changes with each new release.) The \\"1 Mobile Market\\" app can only install the APK file, you have to install the OBB file.<br /><br />STEP 3: Completely install the app. As strange as it may seem, in this case you must install the OBB file BEFORE installing the APK file. (This applies to both new and upgraded installations.) You must create a directory (or folder) for the OBB file on your Kindle Fire and then move the OBB file to that directory. The directory for the OBB file is created as follows: Using a file explorer, navigate to the folder /sdcard/android/. (sdcard is a directory on your device and not an SD card.) Create a new folder caller \\"obb\\". Then in that folder create another new folder called \\"org.jw.jwlibrary.mobile\\". The OBB file must go here: /sdcard/Android/obb/org.jw.jwlibrary.mobile/.<br /><br />I found that I needed to download and place the OBB file (additional Bibles) in its proper directory (as described at the above link) and then shut down the device (by holding for 5 seconds the switch), restarting it and then installing JW Library.<br /><br />After the OBB file is installed, and you have restarted your device, you can either run the \\"1 Mobile Market\\" app, or run the APK file that you have placed in your \\"Download\\" directory.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL NOTES:<br /><br />1. I learned that those with the first edition of Kindle Fire will have to forgo KIT.  The browser for that device is not capable of displaying the Greek with the English just below it.<br /><br />2. You can install an Android emulator on your PC and install and update JW Library on it. (This is how I get my files.) The program I use is called \\"BlueStacks\\". I use \\"Root Explorer\\" to find the APK file, and then using \\"Dropbox\\" I transfer both files to my PC. I hook up my Kindle Fire with a cable to my PC and create the OBB directory and place the OBB file there using Windows Explorer (this configuration sees the Fire as an external drive to your PC, which simplifies the process immeasurably). I then put the APK file in the \\"Download\\" directory, and then disconnect the Fire from my PC and shut down the Fire (by holding the switch for 5 seconds). After restarting the Kindle Fire, using ES File Explorer I go to the Download directory on my Kindle and double-click on the APK file to install it. And voila!  It works (for me) every time!<br /><br />3. There are two files that make up the complete JW Lib package. The APK file is the main program and also contains the 2013 Bible. OBB file contains the other Bibles, and I understand that in the future it will also contain other publications. (APK and OBB are file name extensions. APK stands for \\"Android application package\\", and an OBB file is an \\"Android Opaque Binary Blob File\\" and contains data.)<br /><br />4. JW Library is on version 1.03 as of this writing. That means they are responding to users, but it also means that your app may become outdated. With each update, you will need to go through this whole process again. And if you used the \\"1 Mobile Market\\" app to install the program, it will automatically update the APK file and the OBB file will no longer work.  (sigh)  If I have discouraged you from attempting this, maybe this is a good thing . . . . . .as of this writing. That means they are responding to users, but it also means that your app is going to be outdated quickly. With each update, you will need to go through this whole process again. And if you used the \\"1 Mobile Market\\" app to install the program, it will automatically update the APK file and the OBB file will no longer work.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I recommend it 100%<br />Easy reading about life´s everyday happenings. Amazing characters<br />Nice surprise finding this author.<br />Good luck<br />mbh
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This book is intelligent, amusing, snarky, educational, and riveting.  I actually felt like I learned something about the world that is would have been harder to understand from news or history.
B00F9040HU|3.0|Don't like it as welll as Jewel Quest Heritage. I think it is difficult and slow.  It also times out too fast.  Don't like the color either.
B003O86FMW|4.0|As a sequel, it does its job of answering questions and moving the story along.  I enjoyed it on that basis. Had it been a stand-alone book, it would not have been that interesting.  Must read, if you are into the trilogy.  On its own, not so much.<br />Loved the first one.  Currently reading the last one.
B00EHMG358|5.0|Can't wait to get the rest of the book!!  Preston & Child have a way of telling a story that makes you want more every time..
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|An interesting science-fantasy film, which I found enjoyable.  The science is weak - FTL space drives, yet the need to battle monsters with swords.  If you can suspend your need for logical science, the film was fun.  Camera work nice, and acting OK.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have never read a book that is so heart-breaking and yet fills me with utter happiness all at once. It changed my outlook on life itself, along with illness and death. I will never read a book that lives up to this one again. It was so well written and magnificenlty descriptive I COULD NOT put it down. John Green is a literary genius, literally. If you have not read this brilliant novel, I urge you to stop what you currently doing and read it immediately. You will not be disappointed, I assure you. I am only 15 years old and I have read this book three times in the last ten days. I promise you, it is the best book you will ever read! Please, for the sake of everything, READ THIS BOOK.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book just got better and better with each turn of the page.  A good read with a surprise ending.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|A truly unusual setting, and an interesting collection of characters - even if most of them feel more like part of the setting than true characters.  I spent the first 80% of the book nervous that there was no way it would all fit together at the end, and the last 20% kicking myself for not seeing how well it would fit together at the end.  Really, really well done.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Just like season 1, there are some gut-busting moments. They upgrade some of the characters claymation, too. Can't wait for next season.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is very interesting and fun to play. I would recommend this to my friends. My daughter introduced me to this game and I can't stop playing.
B001RTSPVY|4.0|Hard to stop watching, only a few dull spots throughout.  This program is completely original and unlike anything else that 's out there.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great characters, great setting, great pacing; Howey does a great job of setting up and revealing the mysteries of the past.  One of the best books I've read this year.
B00B4Z5J92|3.0|The part about the Sound City studio, the Neve console and the analog to digital recording revolution was quite interesting. The part  showing some of the recording sessions for Real to Reel was not that interesting as there are many other session videos from the past that were way more exciting than watching a bunch of &#34;old&#34; guys trying to be relevant when they are not. Yes, it shows that they can still make music, but it doesn't pass the Berry Gordy test of &#34;would you give up eating lunch so you could use your lunch money to buy this record&#34;
B00F52YOPA|4.0|This game is great! There is enough to keep you challenged, and the graphics are great on my HD Kindle!
B004KKX80A|5.0|This is an awsome beyblade but it came in late.<br />It spins forever and it also beat my brothers storm peguaus.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|Being a kids from the 80's generation, this has to be one of the favorites. Had it on VHS but am slowly transitioning to all DVD or Blu-ray and HAD to have this movie in my library. Good transaction! Thanks!
B007V5CF5K|2.0|There is no skip and there is no way to touch the piece without going back to the main scree. Sometimes in other games you can move the screen or enlarge it to get to it but not with this one. So can't go on.
B00FEN1C50|4.0|I really enjoyed the special effects in this movie! The storyline is unique as well too. This movie didn't do so hot in the US, but was<br />well accepted internationally. I wouldn't pay movie prices to see it but makes a solid rental.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is so much fun! I love all of the mini games and I love getting new characters! If you need something to eat up your time, get this app!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|\\"Imagine that your husband wrote you a letter, to be opened after his death. Imagine, too, that the letter contains his deepest, darkest secret--something with the potential to destroy not just the life you built together, but the lives of others as well. Imagine, then, that you stumble across that letter while your husband is still very much alive. . . .\\" The Husband's Secret centers on three women who are all struggling with their own personal stories. Their lives will intersect and the secret that has been guarded for so long will impact them all. This story is told in alternating lead point-of-views. Although this narration style could cause confusion in some books, it works flawlessly in this one. The writing is wonderful; it's as if this writer has personally lived the lives of these three separate women. Their emotions, perspectives, motives, etc. are so descriptive. I highly recommend this book for fans of woman's contemporary fiction. Make sure you read the epilogue- all the characters' secrets comes out!!!<br /><br />I listened to the audiobook version of The Husband's Secret and it engaged me from the first few sentences. I adored the Australian accent and overall voice quality and speaking style of the narrator Caroline Lee. The narrator makes all the difference when it comes to audiobooks! I found myself looking for every available opportunity to listen to this almost fourteen-hour book.<br /><br />Favorite Quotes:<br />\\"Falling in love was easy. Anyone could fall. It was holding on that was tricky.\\"<br /><br />Regarding long-term partners: \\"It was easier to pretend there was nothing more to know, to fall into an easygoing companionship. It was almost embarrassing to be truly intimate with your spouse; how could you watch someone floss one minute, and the next minute share your deepest passion or most ridiculous, trite little fears? It was almost easier to talk about that sort of thing before you'd shared a bathroom and a bank account and argued over the packing of the dishwasher.\\"<br /><br />\\"Some secrets are meant to stay secret forever. Just ask Pandora.\\"e packing of the dishwasher.\\"<br /><br />\\"Some secrets are meant to stay secret forever. Just ask Pandora.\\"
B006RAFHFK|2.0|I love both Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro, but their combined star power can't overcome the terrible pacing here. Yuk.
B00FPH51LQ|3.0|If you liked Men in Black you'll probably enjoy this one. The storylines are eerily similar. Kevin Bacon plays a solid bad guy. Jeff Bridges did a wonderful job with his character and has good chemistry with his partner Ryan Reynolds. I wouldn't pay movie prices to see it, but a solid rental.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Storyline is great, It was very had to put down once I began reading it.  I would suggest it for anyone who likes these types of books
B009OYTIXS|4.0|AWSOME PLOT LINES!!!! VILLIANS SHOWING UP IN THE ARROW'S WORLD MAKES THE SHOW  interesting such as ; DEADSHOT!! AND DEATHSTROKE!!!!!! IF YOU ENJOY SUPER HEROS MOVIES OR TELEVISION SHOWS,THEN YOU SHOULD GIVE THE GREEN ARROW A SHOT!!!!!!!!!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I enjoyed this. It's got a lot of style and the stars are interesting. I thought it could use some editing, but still enjoyed it.
B00122DF16|5.0|Must have if your a LKP fan! I cant stop listening to the CD, the music is very intoxicating! Get iy now!
B002QCAXOS|5.0|The last 15 minutes of this movie are amazing.  For people who like 70s dystopian cinema, this is a must-watch old film.  This quality of this streaming version is excellent.
B00FEN1C50|3.0|Pacific rim is an alright movie if you enjoy monster movies. Watch out for the destroyer of worlds. The king of monsters will retake his throne soon!!!!!!!!!!
159463176X|5.0|Hosseini's prose is beautiful. I am fortunate enough to have visited Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion. I spent a couple of months in and around Kabul in 1969, rented a house in Shar-e-Nau and visited the Buddhas before the Taliban destroyed them. Since the novel spans the before-and-after of Kabul, I took me back to the old days and enlightened me regarding the many changes. I grieve and mourn for Afghanistan and its people. So many years of senseless warfare. Such a marvelous people.<br />The reader doesn't have to share my background to enjoy this work. It's an adventure that travels from Kabul, to the Greek Island of Tinos, to Paris, and California's Silicon Valley. The only bad part is that it has an end!
B002YCVX5S|2.0|Tarantino will always be compared to his classic works, and this does not live up to Pulp Fiction.<br /><br />There is little romance in terms of characterisation and the plot is contrived. Not his finest hour.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Took the kids to see it in 3D, but at home it's just as beautiful. A little entertainment for everyone.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|This is just a good story. Not a lot of special effects but it is fun to watch. The movie is true to the jack reacher stories. Well done.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|Really awesome movie!!! It's a little weird but beautiful and touching all the same!! If you haven't seen this movie you need to!!
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Simply put, this is finest sci-fi of the last 10 years, blending politics and humanitarian disaster against the cautionary tale of machines who wish to become masters.<br /><br />Awesome.
B00A8OWOSO|5.0|It was very entertaining to watch. Things are not always what they seem to be. I would recommend everyone see it.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Not a lot to say about it. It was good. It borrowed most of its ideas from other films. So there was nothing that really blew you away.
B00E8KLWB4|1.0|took way to long to down load not worth it. waited over 10 minutes and still no app. I would not recommend this after it was installed I deleted the app it kept freezing and I was never able to even play. after all the waiting i finally decided to just delete the app. not worth it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book was a wonderful surprise for me as, although I love the author, I thought any follow up to the Shining would be a disappointment as is ruefully acknowledged by the author in the afterword.  Stephen King need not worry as he outdoes himself in this the story of Danny Torrance all grown up.  This was a story I actually enjoyed more than the first and I couldn't put it down!  I never would have pictured Danny's life turning out the way it did but of course, it is totally perfect and couldn't be any other way.  This book was such a wonderful surprise and I hope all enjoy it as much as I have.
B005XUC398|5.0|This was a very good movie. Not at all what I expected but I really enjoyed it.  It was eye opening to see how these situations start and how they play out.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|It started out ok. The characters were not developed very well. The started a lot of different ideas and didn't really finish any of them.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|The High School of the Dead: Complete Collection [Blu-Ray], I very much enjoyed this anime, if you love anime and you love zombies JUST GET IT, you wont be disappointed.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a quick easy to use calculator and my Kindle was handy.  I searched, found, downloaded, and used in a few short minutes.
B005IDXIL2|4.0|I would've giving it 5 stars but it doesn't have a screen that comes up showing your continuous scores in a row from start to finish. It shows you your ending score after you finish each game, and it comes up very quickly and then disappears.  Other games make you list your total score for each game  you finish, or some automatically put each of your total ending score listed, this way you can always click on the WORD SCORES and view all your totals of each game.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This was a really good read. I wish they had talked more about how Oz became \\"the great and powerful\\".
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|If you like Bruno Mars you have probable heard a lot of his songs, this is a nice album with some of his good ones
B000ICXQXS|5.0|Amazing film that still leaves you laughing after all these years.  It's humor aged well and has a great story!
B009HUB40Y|2.0|It ends your playing and wants you to either log on, or pay/buy coins. Then I just sign off it's very disappointing, and I thought it was a free game to play, when in fact it is not!!!
B00FFRAKRG|2.0|The vocals seem dispassionate. I have a hard time picking out any of the great bass lines that have dominated some of their better albums. The sound of the album just seems too processed, and really kind of boring. I hear the extra guitars in there, but I'm not overly impressed. Just last week I listened to their first 2 albums again, and this stuff doesn't even come close.<br /><br />Korn III gave us a glimpse of the old Korn, this is some mild watered down stuff that I just can't get into, hopefully it'll grow on me a little bit, but it seems unlikely.
B003O86FMW|5.0|every part if this book is great. she did a good job! the movie is great too. i love readong this.
B00000F214|5.0|Truly an amazing film, this movie is one of a kind. Great acting and a great script make this one of the best crime mystery ever!
031603438X|5.0|because it is written good and Keith Richards is for me a very interesting person anyway. so it is great reading his biographie
0143124544|3.0|As many reviews on this site have already stated, Moyes' love story is deep and rich. It is in fact one of the most convincing, realistic, and heart-wrenching tales of love that I have read and I simply could not put it down. Yet, while I enjoyed following Will and Louisa's journey, it was painful to read this book at times. Moyes' portrayal of a quadriplegic who does not want to live is frustrating and reinforces a commonly held stereotype (which is actively acknowledged throughout the book) that people with severe disabilities could not have lives worth living. While Moyes makes some effort to demonstrate the other point of view - that there is in fact beauty and joy while living in a wheelchair - the predominant theme throughout the book remains the pain, heartache, and uselessness of Will's life. Perhaps one could argue this is a refreshingly open and honest look at the hardships of being a quadriplegic, or that it provides a unique ending to the worn-out happily ever after alternative. To that I say that Moyes is an author, and a relatively famous one at that. When you have the ears of over a million people you need to understand that what you publish is not written in a vacuum. In the context of a predominantly ableist society, this book is playing into stereotypes with only a marginal glance at dissenting points of view. It is a shame, because it sullies a truly wonderful piece of literature.
B0000C3I6U|4.0|I like Lou Ferrigno better than Arnold, if you watch this movie you probably will to; Arnold acts like a complete jerk. He was a crappy lying Governer to, acting is lame mostly, Still it's a motiviational flick for body builders.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Insightful. Didn't want to put down. Susan Cain has done a service for all people who work better alone, think better alone, need quiet time, etc.
B00A0SO4S6|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. It's clever and fun. A fun little mystery, with fun plot twists. Definitely a good movie to watch with your significant other.
B007JNWJMI|4.0|It's okay but I just haven't found myself using it as much as I thought I would.  Lots of nice features though.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book has some intense parts but I loved the story behind it! Also at the end of the 3rd book I like how it gives insight as to what happened to make him the way he was.
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|She is a beautiful, independent and dutiful woman. Speaks her mind and always puts people at ease. How can I not love a woman like that. She decided that she is to be happy she has to take matters into her own hands.She decided her destiny.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|How can you not love Fat Amy?  This movie makes me laugh and I always have that &#34;feel good&#34; feeling at the end.  This movie isn't rocket science, but the one liners are perfect.  I've watched this at least 10 times and will continue to do so every time I'm in the mood for a laugh!
B004FOOQV6|3.0|Somewhat difficult to use but it does what it's supposed to and converts almost anything.  I like it.  Good app.
B00F2P8ZDC|4.0|Looks great except for a couple little changes and one screw up 4 1/2 stars for looks. Only big screw up is the flipping of a couple scenes in the Part Of Your World song. Also when Ariel and Eric jump off Ursula a black bar appears for a second. Other than that it's minor things like the clams having a different interior color in some shots. I understand Disney is taking the Bl-ray and DVD back for exchange. Not the 3D version at this time though. Sound also scores a 4 1/2, IMO
B004CFBMRY|5.0|If you want a lesson in running better blended into a great story this is for you. I found it absorbing.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Greatest movie ever made. My family and I have loved watching this movie together during the holidays. I would recommend this movie to anyone!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Fun Temple Run style game with additional challenges making it more interesting. The graphics are really good too. I like the daily challenges.
B00BWJ91XK|3.0|Anticlimactic but great to watch if you are into the lotr series. I would see the next hobbit for what it is worth.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was amazing to read. I finished all three books in 1 week. I need more Fifty Shades books. I'm like the little girl off the commercial &#34; We want more! We want more! &#34; I loved these books
B00F91RYL8|1.0|A zombie movie that is bad in so many ways. If Brad Pitt wasn't in this it would have been a miserable flop. With Brad Pitt in this, it's still a miserable flop. Avoid at all costs.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book. Can not wait to start the next one. Finished this book in less than a day.
B005COO1X6|5.0|This was a crazy story, but I couldn't STOP until I finished it. VERY entertaining, and a surprise ending. KINDLE Shorts are fun to read.
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|This series has a good mix of characters, settings, seriousness, humor and action.  It is enjoyed by our whole family.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I really wanted this device to work for me, but was very disappointed, it played one time from my Nook HD,afterward picture would start and stop throughout the whole movie, sometimes would not start-up again.  Again, it would get to 25% and the download would just spin, so I feel like it was a waste of money.  I really wanted it work.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|Whether you like combat sports or not this movie is highly inspiring and very well put together. Great chemistry between the actors, great plot. I've loved this movie from the first time I watched it!
0425252868|2.0|This book was incredible and unbelievable .  The courage of Franz, the German pilot was outstanding.<br />I loved the book and many of my friends are buying it.
B00FN811SY|5.0|the most informative bible to find the solid truths as understood when written by the original writers. Makes studying much easier to find accurate information to learn from and to share
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I loved it - one for me, one for Bro.  We saw Vince in Kansas City - he is fabulous.
0140569324|5.0|Thrilled to able to purchase this on line - fascinating for all children, and a timeless favourite. Loved by my children and now my grandchildren.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This app  out shines every single one on the market. I had to give a talk in front a bunch of people and my printer broke right before I was to give it and was out time. I just grabbed my Kindle, took a deep breath, mounted the platform and tried to relax.<br /><br />The program has a nice menu out of way instead of all sorts of boxes flying around obstructing the view when moving around. I can create and edit Excel, Word type documents. It will export to PDF but will not allow for highlight of them unfortunately.<br /><br />This is a VERY well developed app with all sorts of cool stuff!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Magnificent (almost lifelike) animation; warm, touching story; makes for a cozy night with loved ones and fond memories throughout the year.

B00F3WBQ0I|3.0|I love the vampire diaries. but the TV has already aired 5 episodes. where are the rest of them? theres only one up. I missed the aired episodes and I was ready to pay to see them, but they're not here. It's a bit depressing.
B008KHG2K2|5.0|I've been wanting this for a while it was in perfect condition and just an amazing statue. It was worth every penny.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Once I started I couldn't stop watching. I love these characters. The writing is engaging and the acting is superb.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Tried to download 3x with no success.  Deleting for last time. Frustrated as hell and kind of disappointed but glad it was free so at least I don't feel ripped off.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Fast delivery. I have a windows 8 pc and the driver for the adapter installed automatically...no downloads or cd installation needed. I'm not really a tech guy, but it works just fine for me. Speed is great (I also have it connected to a USB 3.0 port)<br />0
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Really fun and an addictive game. Had a great time playing through various stages on my kindle fire! Enjoy it!
B00E66QPCG|4.0|Well worth the money spent! Simple and effective strategy that I have tested and works. And to make things even easier, the Infinity Futures Trading Platform Simulator (mentioned in the ebook) contains the Rockwell 'Simple Strategy Template with your charts already customized and set up to test this strategy for yourself.
B00EP0KBXM|2.0|Not much I can say outside of everything just being stupid...<br /><br />The acting and plot was terrible, couldn't hardly understand his son when he spoke and just couldn't get into the character Will was playing.  Definitely not what I expected.
B001K3EXTA|4.0|Not too long ago I saw the revised Great Gatsby with Leonardo DiCaprio, but I like this version the best.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really cool game there are cool challenges and the game just is so awesome with the different characters
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Once I got used to having them (LOL) I started using them to make notes of ideas from what I was reading, things I may want that are recommended at the end of a book, ideas I wanted to share with friends - really handy to have instead of carrying paper and pens.  Used it on a train trip when sharing with fellow travelers who had suggestions about what to do and what to see.  Highly recommend.  It also contains a calendar as well as the ability to archive your notes or trash them.  Recommend
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this novel years ago and wanted to refresh my memory looking forward to the upcoming movie.<br />This is a great novel for teen and pre-teen readers. A marvelous  introduction to the world of speculative fiction.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|I love this, I had already read it in paperback, but couldn't resist getting it for the kindle because it is such an easy convenient way to read.  The characters are all great and the story although a little like 84 Charing Cross Place is far more interesting to me. It really begins with a series of letters exchanged between a female writer and a man who lives on the Island of Guernsey which is the similarity to the 84 Charing Cross story.  The characters are fictitious, but their stories are based around things that actually happened during WW2 during the German Occupation of Guernsey.  They are such interesting characters , some you love more than others as  it is with many books.  There is such a range of emotions in this story which is so often quite funny with the quirky people and other times really sad.  In the latter parts you feel quite angry at the way people are treated.  I don't want to delve too much into the characters as I think it would spoil it, but I think most readers couldn't fail to get a lot of pleasure from reading this.  I just wish that a movie would be made from it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King's stories always touch a nerve, but he outdid himself on this one.  If we could time travel, should we?  That is the question he explores more than adequately through real life experience in this book.<br /><br />I highly recommend it!
B00CKKDZ2S|3.0|For a free app it isn't too bad but really basic and lists angels by their attributes rather than using angelic names.  For example: Angel of Faith, Queen of Peace and Angels of Peace, and Angel of Learning.  Each &#34;card&#34; gives the explanation of the card then a daily affirmation to use.  If you want to use the &#34;Past, Present, Future&#34; feature then you need to you can only get &#34;past and present&#34;; to bet the &#34;future&#34; portion you have to purchase it.  If  you just want to pull a daily card with an affirmation it does that.
B00EUS6FR0|3.0|\\"Get Happy\\" is somewhat like their album [[ASIN:B002RX7NOO Splendor in the Grass]] which had a flawed back half but would still serve as an introduction to Pink Martini. With China Forbes singing three songs and as co-singer on two more this looks to be the transition album to Pink Martini's next lead vocalist, Storm Large.<br /><br />Storm Large has the strongest voice of the many guest singers but is able to control it so it doesn't generally get to the point of stridency. You might say her voice is more heavy in tannins, which would lend itself to singing songs from \\"Chicago\\" rather than the vulnerability of [[ASIN:B000QZ1KOY torch songs]]. Of her four songs, \\"Omide Zendegani\\" and \\"Pân? Când Nu Te Iubeam\\" are among the album's finest tracks, the latter sporting a flavor similar to \\"Bolero\\".<br /><br />That said, this is probably my least favorite among Pink Martini's catalog. As has happened with previous albums sometimes guest vocalists seem to be chosen more for who they are than for their vocal abilities. In more than one case pitch is negotiable. In contrast, the preceding album [[ASIN:B005X1MP5O 1969]] with Saori Yuki (\\"the Streisand of Japan\\") was so good precisely because its entirety was delivered by an accomplished vocalist. The many guests on \\"Get Happy\\" probably made for enjoyable sessions with friends and acquaintances but it reminds me of how [[ASIN:B001OAWKFI camaraderie]] doesn't necessarily translate to the listener experience.<br /><br />I hesitated at getting this latest release because Pink Martini had developed into a formula as identifiable as a late seventies Linda Ronstadt album. One or two latin-flavored songs inevitably paired with a choppy, playful piano, one or two childrens' songs. You'd get the feeling that the latter would be included to face the challenge of making a silk purse out of a song that was known for being corny or insipid (e.g. \\"Sing\\" by the Carpenters). And most of the time it would be the low point of the album. The absence of those elements suggests that Pink Martini is freshening up their sound. Perhaps it helped to shake things up a bit by recording the intervening holiday album and an album with Saori Yuki.<br /><br />If you're new to Pink Martini you'll be thrilled at the discovery of their wonderful sound, and the good news is, it only gets better as you explore the rest of their catalog. In particular I'd recommend their holiday album [[ASIN:B0044LK8J4 Joy To The World]], [[ASIN:B000QQWH3G Hang On Little Tomato]] and [[ASIN:B000QQS0JG Sympathique]].<br /><br />What if you're just looking to download a few tracks as highlights? On my Amazon cloud I had a playlist of 31 Pink Martini favorites from a half dozen of their other albums. From \\"Get Happy\\" I've added:<br />\\"Ich Dich Liebe\\" (China Forbes)<br />\\"Omide Zendegani\\" (Storm Large)<br />\\"Zundoko\\" (Timothy Nishimoto)<br />\\"Pân? Când Nu Te Iubeam\\" (Storm Large)<br /><br />\\"Heliotrope Bouquet\\" (a Scott Joplin instrumental) is also one of the better tracks here but at just over one minute long you might rather get a strong collection of [[ASIN:B00122FWRG Scott Joplin Piano Rags]] instead. It does point to an interesting possibility for future Pink Martini albums. If China Forbes looks to be reducing her visibility, why not increase the number of instrumentals or even record an all-instrumental album?<br /><br />I do wish this download included a PDF of the physical CD's booklet contents.bsence of those elements suggests that Pink Martini is freshening up their sound.

B007TK77QE|3.0|I am still only 50% through and I am finding it long winded and a bit boring.  I feel it is far too detailed and seems to be never getting somewhere.  I much preferred The Cuckoo's Calling.  I also find the amount of swearing rather annoying.  Obviously, the characters who swear most are either the rougher individuals or the teenagers but I feel the writer is over using the bad language, sometimes to the point of my irritation.  This probably does not affect most readers, but my personal taste deems the use of bad language used in this story is a little too much for me.
B00BOXZAG6|5.0|The special effects are great, the 3D version is a must get the full information and enjoyment intended by the director.
B0086700CM|2.0|The problem I have is manual dexterity.  It is a run and jump type of game and I am just no good at any game like that.  I thought I'd try it but didn't work out at all.  If you are someone what has dexterity and plays games like mario bros and other run, jump and dive you will probably enjoy it a lot.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I really loved the first few books in this series, but this one was too slow paced in my opinion, therefore I have to decrease my rating. Some storylines proceed ok, but the others do not seem to progress at all in this one. I hope that Martin picks up the speed in the last books that are coming! Anyways, this is well worth reading for the fans of the series.
0618154043|5.0|This book is sooooo good. Got here very promptly and such a great read by Tolkien himself. Thank you for this book
B005LAIIGW|5.0|This is a great performance by Sandra. Watching in 3D really helps you pretend you are also in space. Thanks to who ever had the foresight to produce this in 3D.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|I liked this movie.  I won't rave about it, but it was still entertaining.  The comedic interaction across the all the characters was solid, and the action was great.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I was originally really skeptical about the Flow option - seemed like a recipe for typo after typo. But it works great, has a pretty smart auto correct, and a handy back of emoticons. Totally worth the money.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great app. Runs flawlessly on my Kindle Fire. Large selection and variety of sounds with the best quality of sounds I've found compared to other apps of this type. Very customizable - you can choose from indivdual sounds or music, or from pre-set combinations, or create your own combinations and save them as favorites. It also allows you to adjust the volume individually for each sound within the combination. And the interface is very well designed and easy to use. Just love this app. Highly recommended!
B005544V6A|5.0|Sexy, funny, sweet, sad, smart, in acting and writing.  The entire ensemble is terrific--Macht, Adams, Markle, Rafferty, Torres, and let's not forget Rick Hoffman!  The music is good, often amazing (eg Scottie's entrance music in Play the Man).  Really nice to have so many strong female characters.  More like life that way.
B0092S4WLY|1.0|This is the second escape game ive tried, and it is not as good as the first, \\"Can You Escape\\" by MibiGrow.  This has far less action necessary, so the skill level is much lower. the touch sensitivity is nowhere near that of my other apps, I spend most of the time tapping around the same object just trying to find its sweet spot.  The quality all around is far inferior to that of others.  After level one of \\"Can You Escape\\" I was captivated and hooked.  By level two of this particular app I was done and ready to delete.  It even takes forever just to load.  There are better escape game apps out there.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|There was so much action.my favorite part was when Leo showed them bunker 9.You should read this awesome book everyone
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent time piece. Great costuming. Very realistic story line. Accurate tunes to world events. I fell in love with many stories in this series.
B0019IB0II|5.0|This was an amazing book, and I think everyone should read it just to have an idea of what to look for yourself. Certainly opened my eyes to not only the clues, but the healing process itself.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is my new favorite app! I'm always looking for challenging logic games and puzzles and this is perfect. There are several puzzles in each scene so it's well worth the cost.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game if fun a good time waste bls boa boa boa nla play this game its fun como Ezra's t&uacute;
0345525558|5.0|Our book club read this and I liked it so much I bought it.  I recommend it to others who are looking for a great read and regularly lend mine out.
0307346617|5.0|Fan of the genre...this one is the top of the heap.  Got it before the movie came out (thank God...the movie would have ruined the book for me...Pepsi machine...really?)  Very clever way to put it together, using interviews from the survivors...a lot of fun following the quiet rumblings of \\"something being wrong\\" in some areas, to the full out war for humanity through the perspectives of people from all walks of life around the globe.  The movie did a huge disservice to the book.  A+ for the book, D for the movie.  If you've seen the movie, don't let it dissuade you from reading the book.  I gave this to some family members...they all had a great time reading it, even though zombie apocalypse is not their styles.  Definite recommend..
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I have found this game to be addictive and entertaining! It's been great as a fun seasonal game to play.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|Messed up and terrifying. Could have been a little better. I would have toned down the electronic sounding demon voices.
0307744434|5.0|My book club read this and I loved it so much I bought it.  I highly recommend it to others looking for a great book!
B00BEYYO8U|5.0|i did not watch this movie yet, but wanted to add it to my collection.  It is one of the most thrilling Bonds yet!
B00B4BJY7E|5.0|I upgraded my computer with this processor and it's been fine so far having been running for about a month. No complaint. Actually I need to praise this CPU because it significantly improved my game performance. I game with the gt 240 which was previously paired with the celeron e3300. Once I upgraded the processor I found out that the video card was being bottlenecked! Now I can play all Xbox 360/PS3 ports on high settings whereas before there was a good amount of stutter. For example, with Mirror's Edge, before I got 20-25 fps, now it's 40-50 fps, vast difference in playability. Same with Metro 2033. Both games running in 1080p by the way. I'm very happy my video card still packs some oomph thanks to the g1620.<br /><br />I actually upgraded thinking it'd improve my GIS processing but I think my issue has to do more with my internet speed when buffering the basemaps, which if you are in this field at all you'd know the pain of waiting for maps to load.<br /><br />Amazon had the best price for this CPU at the time of my purchase; if you can find this under $45, it's a bargain. Other things to note:<br /><br />Online benchmark scores: E3300 ~ 1450; G1620 ~ 2750<br />In other words the G1620 rivals the high end Core 2 duo/quads<br /><br />My rig: [mobo: biostar tz77a], [CPU: g1620 stock], [RAM: 6GB DDR3 @ 1333MHz], [GPU: GT 240 512MB GDDR5], [SSD: Kingston ssdnow 120GB]
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I have always loved Horror Movies, strange romance, crime dramas and a good leading man. Dexter has been awesome since Season 1 and I have watched and enjoyed every episode; always wanting more. If you like dark dramas and cops with a side of sexy and a few giggles along the way, watch Dexter and you will not be disappointed.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Great movie with a lot of action. I would recommend to anyone and I can't wait until the sequel. Boom!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is so fun to play. My whole family fights over who is going to play next. I wish there was other city's we could play and new missions. You have to get this app.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent book, slow moving at first but stay with it. The end came way to fast for me. Book tells us how life intangles us all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm completely in love wit this book I can not wait to read the next two books I'm so excited!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Love this quick easy way to communicate with family and friends.  Love to read the feed back as well. Great product
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Love Fringe it always kept me wonting more and I can't wate to see the 4th season. It should be just as good. Amazon forcing me to leave a longer appinion is aggravating.
B00338QENI|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was well written, very informative and thought provoking.  It gives a very interesting perspective about the ethics of medical research.
1433537427|5.0|Love this Bible.  I am enjoying the ESV translation and love the resources and online access.  The bible itself is beautifully put together and small enough to easily carry.
B009B1UZ7C|4.0|There are some pretty good songs on this CD. I would probably buy more from this artist. Good Change from what I usually get. I has a bit of a country feel to it with a little rock.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Each and every time I pick up a book by mister king I am reminded of why I feel in love with reading as a teenager bravo sir the quality over quantity keeps me coming back to see what tales a master craftsman can bring forward. As all great story tellers mastery of this skill is a constant goal often sought never gained. Please never  give up the obsession.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I tried this game when it was FAOTD... and was instantly hooked.  At first I didn't know what to do, but the excellent tutorial walked me through an easy game, and then I was ready to play!  I found that most of the puzzles were pretty easy, but I enjoyed solving all of them.  If you haven't played this type of puzzle before, it helps to start with the easy (5x5 grid) and then the harder (10x10 grid) and finally the hardest (15xx15 grid.)  If you like logic games you will probably like this one.  I have noticed that this developer has created several similar games in this series... and I will probably buy all of them.
B00127RAJY|4.0|The 30 Day Shred program is great!  Unfortunately, the DVD skips and breaks up in some spots.  Seems like it may have been a used DVD.  Thought I was purchasing a new item, not used.  But, the actual program is good.
B00DIJQAI6|5.0|It takes awhile to download but whatever, I'M SOOO GLAD THAT I HAD 500COINS FOR THIS GAME YOU HAVE NO IDEA. YOU MUST DOWNLOAD Asdfghjkl
B00BIVN82M|5.0|a brand new CD will be sold in an Antique Shop to people who enjoy the new renditions of the old songs - Order received promptly -thanks
B009PMEEY2|5.0|If you enjoy &#34;Match Three&#34; games, this one is excellent!  I finished it in about 4 hours of play and am now trying to get a star in all levels.  That will probably take a while.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this game is soooooooo fun just like deer hunter reloaded but better graphics and stuff you should get it I love it and ive had it for like half an hour
B00127RAJY|5.0|These workouts have kicked my butt! This isn't just for beginners; I have an ex-marine as a workout buddy, and even though he pushes himself harder than the instructers do he gets a lot from these workouts as well. Jillian Michaels is very inspiring!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|&#34;Sing it Rod&#34;!!!  Great CD for all ages.  Thank you for sending it promptly and it arrived in good shape. The antique shop customers love it
B008OW1SAC|5.0|This album is original and amazing.  I've purchased a lot of albums I've thoroughly enjoyed over the last few years, but few of them are both fantastic and utterly original.  This is both.  I won't make the mistake of trying to describe the music or compare Alt-J to another band, because I don't think it is fair to the band to say they sound like anyone else.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've been meaning to read this book for a while and I'm glad I finally did. I hope they don't mess up the movie too bad.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm shocked and at the same time in love with this game update.<br />and I'm just in love with this game in general and good job with<br />The update.
B006MGB31Q|1.0|The Alien movies are classic.  But BEWARE, this version has issues and know wonder why it is cheaper than all the others.  The first one I received, box was all damaged.  The second bpx set, picture seemed awesome, until a time counter kept appearing on the screen every 10 or so minutes...sometimes longer, but still...it is way too annoying to keep.  Definitely will be sending back and buying the more expensive box set.  Sorry, but Amazon should take this off their site as It is an import and defective.  Will enjoy getting my refund for this one.  Do yourself a favor and buy the $30 one Made in USA to avoid issues!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|One of the best games on my kindle. My mom loves it too. the graphics are so realistic that it makes me happy!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie is incredible. It follows the book extremely well, with its own slight tweaks here and there. I highly recommend this film for all.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a fun game. Wish there were bigger puzzles, but it was still a lot of fun. Controls were very good.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Flynn novels could be happening in our government and we don't know it. The whole series was great to read.
B0023SDQB2|4.0|The focus is on Siegfried Sassoon's declaration against the conduct of the British government and military in World War I. Hundreds of thousands of lives were squandered when the generals followed tactical models that had been made obsolete by modern weaponry. Moreover, the lives were lost in a war being fought without a clear political aim. Sassoon is hospitalized and treated for battle fatigue when he seems just as healthy as his physician. I read with wonder Barker's vision of a spectacle that says once again, &#34;the more things change, the more they stay the same.&#34; Here was post-traumatic stress disorder (although it wasn't called that) treated as if it were a national embarrassment and a flaw or a weakness in the patient. Here was the collusion of the profession of medicine with a corrupt political establishment to suppress awareness of the horror of the war so that the public would continue to support it.  And all very gracefully composed, too. To be read with care if you have hawkish tendencies.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|Entertaining, well written and very educational about the Biafra conflict. The caracters and story are very well Layerd and continue to surprise throughout the book. This will not be the last book I read from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie
B00594XOZU|3.0|At first, kik was perfect, but now, it won't let me login anymore, like at all, can you please fix this?
B009LDCXQQ|5.0|This is so freaking worth every single cent you spend! Do not hesitate to buy this but it now! :-)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been a &#34;constant&#34; reader of SK since is was inn 7th grade (many moons ago). He never disappoints - Doctor Sleep was very hard to put down but found myself so freaked out by it, I'd drop it like it burned me just to stare at it until I found the nerve to keep reading it. Only SK can do that to a person - I will ALWAYS come back for more!
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|Not doing much for me so far. First experiment was a dud which I had faith in.  Rather disappointed at this point.
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|This movie reminded me of \\"The Road\\". A father and son journey that is quiet, slow and dismal. The special effects are very cheap and artificial looking. Will Smith is just a one dimensional CO to his Rangers and his family. Jaden Smith has some promising screen presence. Not sure why some of the actors had a southern type accent. A good watch just once.
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|I have taken this movie as a reminder that just because a film receives poor reviews is not a reason to avoid giving it a chance if the idea behind it interests you. This movie was so widely panned by critics that I had avoided it until one night I really had so few choices that I gave it a shot. I am glad that I did. I watched it with my wife and six children (all of whom are under ten)and everyone was silent and still through the entire thing. If you have kids you likely know how rare that is. Nobody was complaining that Will Smith threw around his weight in a fit of nepotism to film a vehicle for his son to have a starring roll in. Nobody was nit picking the facial expressions of an untried young actor. Nobody's jealousy spilled over into their ability to enjoy what turned out to be a great science fiction vision. And I think that is what it all boils down too. Americans have largely lost their ability to be happy for others who have better opportunities than themselves. I think jealousy and misguided contempt for what was viewed as nepotism on the part of Will Smith overshadowed many critic's ability to do their jobs. Being a critic isn't about being critical of who makes a film but of whether or not the film works as a piece of art. I don't like junkies and drunks but I can tell when one makes fine art. The Louvre is full of examples of this. And while I'm not putting this movie on par with Van Gogh, I certainly wouldn't listen to someone who said his paintings were trash because he had a problem with absinth and lechery.<br /><br />As far as the film itself goes I thought it worked on nearly every level. I would have liked to have seen the back story of human history and the history of the enemy alien race better fleshed out. It had a sort of cold start approach that could have brought people more into the story with greater emotional investment if this was better done, but that's really my only critical complaint. I think run time probably became an issue with this. It was well paced and the sequences 'in the present' were well done. Special effects were great and the technical vision was interesting. I think Sci Fi fans that are honest with themselves will see a lot of value in this movie.<br /><br />One last comment, and this is more of a personal issue on my part than a criticism of the movie making. I am a huge science fiction fan (I have read, without exaggeration, over 50 sci fi books this year and it's October 10th. Most years I do around 75 or 80), but it rankles me a bit that so many films and science future stories use as a vehicle the idea that humans as a race and as a rule are inherently bad and it is a forgone conclusion that we are going to destroy the Earth and will one day have to abandon it or perish. I realize that this is often cautionary, and that it is an easy vehicle to use. That it plays on contemporary fears of environmental degradation. There are many possible futures and many good people working to find a way forward for us as a race. The die is not cast and it would be nice to see Hollywood make something that reflects that. I realize that fear sells, but I would pay for some hope. That said this flick was well worth the price of admission (or rental as the case may be).
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Words gall short, this program knows what your thinking and is the only way I can text when absolutely hammered lol
B0035JNTA6|5.0|Some very funny phrases, not a hollywood bluckbuster but it's guaranteed to make you laugh, one of Ben Stiller's funniest movie
B009NQZVKG|5.0|His best book I've read so far. Fast paced thriller with believable characters and plot. Lots of surprises and action. Can`t wait to read more of his books.
B004UPAN6W|4.0|Gives a good back story to Wolverine's upbringing and ties in well to his flashbacks on how he got the claws and why he lost his memory. It's an entertaining, easy watch.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Awesome! ... It was cool to see a glimpse of The Shining in there, too!  A great read ... I couldn't put it down!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great series. I am glad that there is a program that me and my 12 year old can watch without me worrying that there will be something inappropriate for her to view. My husband even loves watcing with me. Great series. Can't wait until the next session. I have to see what happens from the last episode.
0452273331|4.0|An architecture critic as Dr. Evil? Even Mike Myers didn't go there. It is too frickin' absurd.<br /><br />There are a lot of things I like about this novel. I admire Ayn Rand's veneration of the individual, and her insight about the insidious nature of collectivism's appeal and how it is advanced not directly but obliquely is brilliant.<br /><br />Rand also has a way with one liners: \\"You have to flatter people whom you despise in order to impress other people who despise you,\\" Dominique Francon remarks to her social-climbing husband Peter Keating at one point. Fabulous!<br /><br />However, I have to say that this would have been a far better novel without Francon's character. There is simply no place for a romantic subplot in this novel of ideas, a point made obvious by the utter ridiculousness of the \\"love\\" scenes between Francon and Rand's hero protagonist Howard Roark. As for the infamous \\"rape scene,\\" frankly, if Rand had only used Francon to work out some of her own weird sexual fantasies, it would have been interesting, if in a very creepy way. But as it is, Francon's character is so utterly unconvincing that she becomes a drag on the narrative.  When she is first introduced, she showed great promise as a kind of distaff Roark who is also also living by her own rules. But then she inexplicably dives into self-degradation and self-sacrifice with her marriages and becomes pathetic rather than heroic. That was very disappointing.<br /><br />The best passages in this overlong novel are those where Roark is interacting with characters who have no idea what he is about or how to deal with him. This is where Rand's talent for writing snappy dialogue serves her well. Unfortunately, she also has a tendency to let scenes degenerate into oratory contests where the characters make speeches at each other in totally unvernacular prose. Nobody talks like this, Ayn. This unfortunate tendency is capped by Roark's courtroom address, which is John Galt's (much longer) Atlas Shrugged speech in embryo. That scene reminded me of the concluding courtroom scene in Richard Wright's Native Son, published a few years earlier, where the central character's lawyer makes a similar long-winded, and mostly off-topic, speech with the same purpose: to summarize the author's philosophy for readers who may still not get it. Are there any? If you've gotten that far in the book, I'm pretty sure you have and don't need a summary.<br /><br />At this point in her career, it's clear that Rand the Philosopher was dominating Rand the Novelist, which is unfortunate because her first novel, We the Living, showed she had real promise as a pure fiction writer. The Fountainhead shows she is also an original and insightful thinker about the nature of man and his relationship to society, but those ideas are much better (and succinctly) addressed in nonfiction forms. I first read Rand and grew to like her through her nonfiction essay collections like The Virtue of Selfishness, and that's still where I prefer to get her philosophizing.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|So far it is great, easy to use and auto-sync between phone, kindle, and laptop without any problems. Recommend for anyone needing to keep track of activities.
B000002KYR|5.0|Let me put it this way ... the classic ZZ Top music in modern disc format that has been played nearly non-stop in my husband's vehicle since he received this as a gift.  &#34;Sharp Dress Man&#34; is his favorite.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Exellent lectures, information. I would recommend the TED series to anyone seeking more knowlege on a wide variety of topics.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|A perfectly good streaming app works fine on my phone and on my Kindle Fire.  A great way to experience a game even if you are away from your system.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Scott Lynch does have problems. His characters are essentially Deus ex Machina-ed (Machinaed?) multiple times throughout the series. And like many heist movies everything has to be done just so and there are so many moving parts that it stretches the bonds of belief that it would work out as often as it does. Of course part of the premise of the book is that Locke is a lucky SOB who the gods seem to have a rather perverse love for keeping alive if only barely so I can't complain too much about the narrow escapes. That being said the wordsmithing in this book is gorgeous. I would read it for the descriptions of the cities of the world alone and the people and objects contained in them. Lynch absolutely brings this world alive for me and I can honestly say this book is one of my favorite ones ever. I'm about half way through Republic of Thieves and have already missed my bus once because I was too distracted by it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent acting.  One gets caught up in the lives of both the servants and and the aristocracy they serve.  Stays true to the era.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thought this was a great read. I enjoyed it thoroughly and it was hard to put down. I wanted to read it from cover to cover in one sitting.
8866137626|5.0|Great product that syncs up with Evernote perfectly. I'm a big digital fan but many times I just need some paper to take notes and jot down ideas and sketches.  This notebook is PERFECT. It's small, it's quality, and it works.  Thanks for a great product.
B008RVAAPE|5.0|unputtable, great book cant stop reading, love the story and looking forward to watch it when its filmed. Highly recomend to everyone who likes historical fiction
B00351YEZS|5.0|A masterpiece: this books explains very well the main concepts of physics and astronomy, without being too complex. There are plenty of examples and you don't need any scientific background to understand it. It's the perfect book between &#34;too simple&#34; and &#34;too complicated&#34;.
B009WUBERW|1.0|I wish I didn't have to give it a whole star. This movie was really quite terrible. Don't  waste your time.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Loved it... consumed it in a few days. Hope that the Grey intervention will be released in the future. Loved it.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Have read all the other books about the cousin's war. She weaves a good tale with history thrown in.
1401200605|5.0|One of the best stories since the Killing Joke.  Great story, art and just captivates with every page.<br />Highly recommend if you haven't read.
B006S08RLU|5.0|An absolutely beautiful movie. I enjoy watching foreign films and \\"Amelie\\" is one of the best that I have ever seen. Definitely in the Top 10 of my favorite foreign films. The scene where she literally melts into water at the café is so avant-garde.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a good app, works great. I use it a lot for school. defenetly a good app to buy
B00AACH2EK|5.0|Anyone interested in contemporary music (and not just rock, but jazz and orchestral forms) should be familiar with this work. This was Frank Zappa's debut, one of the first double albums ever released, and a real leap forward for experimental contemporary music. While not the most commercially successful record of its time, this certainly caused more ripples than most. If there's a list somewhere of &#34;most influential recordings,&#34; this album would certainly land near the top.<br /><br />I downloaded the MP3 version, by the way, and it sounds better than I expected it to. The mastering is fine, and while it lacks the &#34;heart&#34; that I remember of hearing it on vinyl when it was fairly new, there's nothing seriously wrong with it. If you're new to Zappa's music or just want to spend a little time on an extra-trippy memory lane, get it, put it on your MP3 player, and go with the flow. You'll be glad you did.
B00FDSV4TA|4.0|Like everyone else, I was very surprised to end up liking this album. I have one issue though. To me (and I may be way off on this) it sounds like the band had all the songs written with Scott singing, Scott leaves, so then in steps Chester and basically copies Scott's voice. Don't get me wrong, I am shocked at how much I like him singing with STP, but he resembles Scott more than himself, which may be why I like it so much.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Good app but lags and I have a constant message at the top that says it needs to be updated and soon this old app we won't be able to log in on. I'm sure it could be better if I could update to the new versions as they become available like on my other android devices. Can't even pay the very few games I play on Facebook because the app store does not have them. Please for the love of all that is modern technology...make the updates and games available on Amazon app store!!!!! I would be more than happy to pay for  THEM!!  Just sayin.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I love everything about this headset. I'm not really going to go into detail because there's already over 1,390 reviews on Amazon for the G930.<br /><br />The headset is very, very lightweight. You can twist the left and right cups so that they can lay flat on a surface. Very comfortable to wear.<br /><br />I love the surround sound. Really makes a huge difference with music, games, and video.<br /><br />Buttons are awesome. I left them on default for basic media control functions. Volume control is a great feature.<br /><br />Mic automatically mutes itself when you raise it up. Pretty neat.<br /><br />The software that can be downloaded from the Logitech website for the G930 is pretty handy.<br /><br />Battery life is very long. Battery life is pretty good, no complaints about that.<br /><br />So far I'm very pleased with this purchase. I was a little hesitant about this purchase, but now realize what all the hype is about.
B00BXRFCFM|5.0|From front to back and side to side, this is one of the best albums I've ever heard and experienced. Having paid money for cd's where it turns out that only a couple songs are good, this is a refreshing buy with every song being great, making it well worth the money!
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Alice Munro is a brilliant writer and these short stories showcase her unique talent.  I am not surprised she got the Pulitzer for literature.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Power, ease of control, versatile. I've had this in for over a year without a single hiccup. Videos, videos games, spreadsheets... you name it and this beast eats it up. I know it also has a lot to due with the rest of my hardware build, but this chip plays well with others and I recommend it.<br /><br />Every other PC I'd built was an AMD platform so I was a little nervous, but it was worth every penny.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Got this for a little project and thought the reviews were probably a little overblown.  Then i got it.  This thing is TINY!  It's supposed to have 10 hrs of use in a charge and I'll have fun testing that out.  I'll try to remember to update here.  The sound is great from this mighty mite.  It delivers very nice detail and amplification without overcomplicating things.  I was worried about counterfeits since there are apparently a lot of them on the market, however mine had Fiio's scratch and verify label on the packaging.
B005HSL626|5.0|The only thing it needs is veggies, 'cuz I hate veggies. But I suppose shredding lettuce and brussel sprouts isn't as much juicy fun. My nephew loved to play &#34;Fruit Aninj&#34; (he was 3) and loves to play &#34;Fruit Ninja&#34; now he's 4.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Next to any kind of bingo I love playing Mahjong I have played this version so many times I have lost count I would recommend this game.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|This book is a very good review of photography principals for any level. I think even the advanced user can benefit from reviewing the fundamentals. I found myself reviewing concepts I thought I understood already but by the end of each chapter I learned something new and realized what sorts of bad habits I've picked up over the years.<br /><br />The topic of creative composition is not specifically coverd, however. This book is really great for teaching you how to make your camera show what you intend it to show. It teaches you how to really use the tool. The next step of the real art of photography is not really covered except in examples while learning about the basics of exposure. That being said, creating art with your camera consistently is impossible without having a strong understanding of the concepts in this book.<br /><br />This book is a must for the beginner and a great review for any level.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|I have never watched Grey's Anatomy until recently--so thrilled to be watching it on my kindle with no commercials! Amazing show and amazing video quality.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Started with the show, now reading this.  Very engaging and well-written series.  If you don't know it, it is far from a basic period story.  Action, drama, comedy and a very complex plot all in one.  And yes, does get a bit into sci-fi and fantasy, but not too much.<br /><br />Also, by the time you get half way through book 2, is not the exact same story as the show.  Interesting to see the differences.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I have had this app for a while and it continues to impress me.  Once I got my network hooked up correctly, I booted this app up and was streaming from my phone to my TV in seconds.  Lots of cool content as well.
B00BTHV05M|4.0|I love One Republic, so it is always good for them to produce work that really represents their uniqueness and range.  This album is a &#34;must listen&#34; (I'm not sure that can stand alone as a phrase, lol).
B009NX1YT6|3.0|I know john is still doing movies but what ever happened to Olivia, I shared this with kids and told them it was nearly a first high school musical.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I would highly recommend this series to men and women alike.  I am looking forward to following the lives of both the upstairs and downstairs characters of the Abbey.  Season 4 cannot come soon enough for me!
B0028IDXDS|1.0|Order #103-7180037-2533839, I purchased a lot of items for my sisters new baby. I recently found out the wubbanub brown monkey, plush toy pacifier was left out, what can be done for this item to be sent or refunded to me. My sister and I live in different states so I just found out.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|The album is worth the buy!!!  She is sooo good and you can really get into this w/o the heartache.  ♥
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|I hated the book, liked the 2nd movie, and loved this one. Leonardo captures Gatsby incredibly as do the rest of the cast.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Loved it!  Affirmed all I believe and reminded me of the power of manifesting with positive thinking.  Especially loved dropping 11/2 pounds in 3days with doing anything but showing gratitude and love for the food that enters my body.  Bravo!  I've been recommending it to folks since the second experiment.

B005PK56TA|5.0|LOVE IT...Cant get enough of this show! Wish I would of known about it sooner now I have to get caught up on season 2
B0026ICAOS|5.0|I don't remember watching the first part of this movie as a kid or it might have sicked me out. I alwsys watched the little kid running through the corn field. An excellent horror classic.
6305128952|4.0|Beautiful theme and beautiful mountain scenery. A moving and thoughtful movie about the rehabilitation of an injured human and an injured horse.
B003DZX44I|5.0|An old favorite story that only Disney can make so beautiful. The Beast a prince deformed by a witch. For not having pitty on her only true love can save him.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Nice game. Has a lot of nice features, such as a well-designed story line. Not to bad game play. To be honest I thought that it would be just like all the rest, but we shall see
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|If you kiss a frog he turns into a prince. Yet in this he becomes a frog who turns a female into a frog. And all she wanted was a restaurant.

1419705644|5.0|Very different from what I expected, but certainly crazy and fun to read. Fantastic art, interesting entries, great quality, portable size. Fans of the show will love the lore.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Helps pass time when business is slow at work.  lol.  I don't really work.  LOVE THIS GAME.  GET IT SOON
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I've seen the Phantom Of The Opera several times and enjoyed it each time.<br />The music is fantastic, The costumes and sets were beautiful and the actors<br />were superb.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Looks great!!  Lots of fun!!!  Have a lot of fun playing and getting better each time. Great game for family!!!
B003O86FMW|3.0|Great read and continuation of the hunger games. A little too reliant on the following book.  I get the whole \\"trilogy\\" thing,, but this chapter seems incomplete and could not stand by itself.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Classic book, good read. The best part or parts of this story are the moral values adhered. Helping others.<br />Wonderful!
B008602KQI|2.0|Good overcomes evil,  but too much like a fairy tale.  It's a kids movie.  I would not recommend it to any adults.
B000EDWKXS|5.0|Nicolas Cage once again makes another awesome movie. Con Air is just awesome. Love the ending. Highly recommend this movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Its a really fun game<br />I love it and i had no problems with the application and it is most definitely worth playing
B00AEBB9O6|5.0|I have seen the movie before but still love it. Mel Gibson did a wonderful job in this movie. Being retired military, watching military movies based on true events is something I really enjoy. I would recommend it to anyone, just not kids.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|This long book is amazing throughout. The stories show the depravity, insanity, suffering, and world-wide convulsion in full. The introductory story itself provokes so much, then it goes from there. &#34;The Greatest Generation&#34;? Not so much. Flawed, with thick rivers of confusion and ego leading to one of the most evil periods in history. This is sensible history, not glorification. And that's much more compelling.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|This is my favorite cd of the year. Wise up ghost is my favorite song on it. Wake me up is a new version bedlam which I though was great because I love that song. I'm going to see costello live nov.22 and I can't wait. I hope he plays some of the song these songs. I got this for elvis costello and now I like the roots! BUY IT!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|All I can say is excellent.  Every bit as good as the previous two seasons.  Highly recommend it for everyone.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|A Feather.<br /><br />A soft white feather drifts down from the blue sky, precariously blown about by the undulating wind. The gentle piano accompaniment begins. And so starts one of the greatest movies of all time.<br /><br />The 67th Annual Academy Awards recognized FORREST GUMP with thirteen nominations and six wins--each of them well-deserved. FORREST GUMP contains almost every theme that makes a great movie: love, friendship, courtship, war, heartbreak, business, diversity, and more. Rarely will anyone walk away from viewing this movie not feeling inspired.<br /><br />The title's character is played by loveable Tom Hanks, who serves as both actor and narrator. Forrest, through time and predicament, chances across many famous people, but what remains the most endearing are the regular people whose lives Forrest has touched: his mother, Jenny, Bubba, and of course, Lieutenant Dan. People are shown in the most miserable of circumstances, overcoming the greatest of obstacles.<br /><br />Not much more can be added to what has already been written about FORREST GUMP. It's a love story, it's a history lesson. It's about war, it's about tranquility. Everything combines in a congruent two-hour moment worth many repeated viewings.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great acting, great casting of characters.  Love the writing and story lines and the ensemble interactions.  I am hooked!<br />Best show about lawyers since LA Law.
0399255370|5.0|Drew Daywalk and Oliver Jeffers's book THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT is a jocular story about a group of unsettled crayons belonging to a boy named Duncan. The querulous crayons are quite adamant in their position of not being used until Duncan rectifies and settles their list of complaints. Some crayons are used too much, some too little, and others are just zealous for more creative use.<br /><br />The crayons present their position through their antic and individual letters written to Duncan. Each fecund letter pleads a unique concern, coupled with a drawn example. Duncan's judicious resolution is turned in as homework, meriting an equanimous solution.<br /><br />THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT is a fun book that kids will enjoy. Laughter and creativity are the effects from this book, which is enough to provide color in the darkest of days.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a wowser!  Keeps you engaged and well written dialogue from every perspective. Suspenseful and quite a surprise...did not expect it.
B000OLX4SU|5.0|Much better than original. Much closer to the book. Frankenstein 's monster is more gruesome than I could ever imagine.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the first 3 seasons over the summer.  I'm ready for January!<br /><br />Adding the series to my kindle allowed me to view while traveling, staying with friends, and on a rainy day.  I love the flexibility my Kindle Fire offers
B002RXZF6C|1.0|Nothing like the book. I dunno how it became such a famous film. Enjoyed the newer one much more. Word.
B00ECLU346|1.0|This movie was just a gimmick to make some quick money off the Hangover franchise. There is none of the craziness of the first two films. Just pitifully bad.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|This is not the best movie ever by any stretch, but if you are a fan of Judge Dredd Comics, and do not want to see his face, this is a great one for you.  Definitely worth the time to watch it.  It is pretty graphic in some spots, lots of action and violence throughout with a truly unlikable bad guy.  So if that sounds like what you want in a movie, check it out.
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|Fun remake ... different approach ... The original is one of my all time favorites ... this is a well-acted tribute.
1845025032|1.0|Too hard to read. My daughter liked it but it is impossible to read to her. She would make up her own version because we could not get through this one. Get the normal version.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Fun story with great actors ... loved the twists. I do agree with many that the end could have been better, but ... My vote for one of the best of the year!
1439130833|5.0|This is a great book and is like a calender and has a teaching for each day to go by that is alligned with the law of attraction. i rather have th regular boo but this is the one with tear out pages.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved this book. Ending was a surprise.  A lot of courtroom politics but keep reading. This book kept me coming back for more.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|The show has many fun characters who are repeated quite often and lots of good twists!  I would highly recommend it!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Basic functions are great.  Changing settings are near impossible, due to lack of instructions. Like the 10 day long forecasts.
1596434252|5.0|Great book! More than I even expected!  I am aiming to do that well in the future, but it's a big challenge.  I may even buy another one as this one I have dissected almost every page out of curiosity.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I am blown away by this CD release, no song can be passed on.<br />Explicit lyrics warning. Great Album from the Fall out Boy!!
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|so I get really sucked in to this great game then I gotta pay ANOTHER $5 to keep playing? seriously?!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it, but I must say that it can be a bit addictive. Been playing for a cpl months and find it difficult to stop
B00F56AZK4|3.0|My daughter really likes doing the puzzles, but there are very few free puzzles, so she just keeps doing the same ones over and over.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I expected more after hearing so much. hated the ending as after reading her character I wanted her to get her dues.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|The struggles of a German U Boat and the crew's dedication to their Captain.  Survival and reign of terror at war.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep<br />by Stephen King<br />Did you ever wonder what happened to the little boy from The Shining, Danny Torrance? Well I did and it looks like Stephen King did too. Because he is back and all grown up with the weight of all he has been through on his shoulders.<br />King has done it again. This book scared the Hell out of me. It is a fitting sequel to The Shining. Doctor Sleep had me looking over my shoulder for the monsters, afraid to go outside after dark and leery of strangers. It made me afraid of every noise I heard at night when I was awake late reading it. Scared to read, but so anxious to know what was going to happen next, that I couldn't put it down. I loved it. This novel has me wondering if there is not more to the most horrendous crimes we hear about than meets the eye. Maybe the non-human monsters are responsible for many or most of them.<br /> If you have something that makes you stand out, like the shining, doesn't make sense that there could be monsters that can see it? If these monsters can feed from the shining, would it matter to them what they have to do to get it? After all, they are monsters.<br />Facts of Doctor Sleep: These monsters truly are EVIL and they are very old.  The monsters run in a pack they call the True Knot, but they look like everybody else. The shining is the strongest in children. A young teenage girl, Abra have the shine, strong enough that it is like a lighthouse beacon and she knows about the True Knot. Abra has seen in her visions what these creatures are capable of. The monsters can only get \\"the steam\\" they fed on from these children that have the shining by torture and death. The True Knot knows that Abra sees them and they can't allow this.  Danny Torrance, Abra and their friends are destined to try and stop the evil creatures and guess where the showdown has to be. That's right, the home of Danny's nightmares. The Overlook Hotel maybe gone, but not its poison.<br />This book corrupted my reading ability for over a week. I didn't want to start another book, because I kept thinking about this one.<br />The only regrets I have about this book is that it had to end and I only have two thumbs to give it thumbs up with. It takes a lot for a book, story or movie to scare me. Well played Stephen, very well played. Now do it again soon. Evil laugh (Ma haw ha ha ha).or over a week.

B00BAYLRNO|5.0|I was amazed that a family could endure so much and survive to talk about it. Although I would never have abandoned my two youngest to a couple of strangers to search for my wife and oldest child, I felt their pain and their joy when they found each other in the end. Great cast and awesome story.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This requires attention but yet it is relaxing to play. Previously I have only been able to find them in blach and white so the color enhances the experience. Love these kind of puzzles.
B00CX7TOTQ|3.0|I liked the action but I felt like I was watching a wrestling match, you know how first the bad guy is winning then the good guy starts to win the match. Overall I thought the movie was OK.
0802473164|5.0|Really helps couples put words together that need to be said but neither party can communicate it!  Would suggest before counseling.  A lot cheaper.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|“The Paradigm Shift” is a tightened, well-oiled, mature, full-circle, masterpiece collective of some two decades of KoRn and the lives of founding members Jonathan Davis, Fieldy, Munky, the returning Brian “Head” Welch, and drummer Ray Luzier. I was scared and skeptical just like the next guy before the album came out but I have to say that it is like they took elements of all previous 10 albums and refined everything to fit together perfectly in a sampling of what makes Korn, well, Korn.<br /><br />There is something on this album for everyone. From the day-one, die-hard, oldskool, Korn fanatics to new fans and everyone in between, this album will arguably be one of their best and most memorable. The album, while sprinkling in various electronic musical elements is predominantly guitar-driven and it is like Munky and Head picked up right where they left off when Head departed almost 10 years ago. Ray’s crisp drumming hits you in the chest while Fieldy’s funky bass lines bring it all together with deep and sick grooves that give me goosebumps. Jonathan Davis shines on this record covering a wide range of the vocal harmonies and layers for lyrics that undoubtedly go into to making Korn who they are and have been from the start.<br /><br />This album IS Korn and I dig it. You should check it out for sure and if you don’t like it…well, that sucks for you, doesn’t it?
0802473156|5.0|Woman may think that men are just silly goof balls, but sometimes they need to be spoken to in certain ways that we are unaware of.  I guess they have feelings too!  Haha.  You women know what I mean.  Definitely suggest reading before jumping into counseling.  Sometimes it's just a lack of what we aren't saying and saying what we are differently.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is addictive, and fun with so many levels you just cannot get bored with this game it will keep you going for hours, graphic is great with music to relax you as you play ,the best match game I have ever played and now my favourite.
B007BVOEPI|2.0|It was well made, no doubt about that, but the bottom line is it was just to gruesome, dark, gritty, depressing for me. I would probably like it if everyone wasn't getting raped or killed or raping or killing 24/7. Pretty interesting story, I just wished I could have read the CLIFF NOTES without having to witness the constant gritty details.
B004GYY714|5.0|Tune in radio is a must have to own app, you can listen to music,sports, news or just about a thing you can think of  on radio with this app covering every country in the world right at your finger tips AM so in love because now I can listen to everything that goes on in my country even though am not living there is like home away from home so in love with this app and highly recommend it.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This movie has some very funny parts. My husband is a &#34;trekie&#34; he give it two thumbs up. Four popcorn bags too
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Very helpful information in dealing with relationships and the complexities that come with being coupled. I use it more now as reference than cover to cover reading.
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|My granddaughter is a big Johnny Depp fan. Waited until she became fifteen before viewing the movie. She was adult enough now to realize he doesn't just do comedy.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Relaxing concentration exercise until you get to the later levels. Then it`s less relaxation and more concentration. Many hours of satisfying entertainment.
B000ICZD5M|5.0|However, it is not the extended version i wanted to see. The extended version I wanted to see was the one that started w/talking about humans the used machines so much they became lazy and the machine became their masters and made them slaves. Then the humans finally had a revolt (that was at the very beginning). There was more information about Pauls love and the death of her father, Dr. kines. And information about Paul marrying the Emperors daughter.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Snuff is another great Disc World book.  I like Pratchett's writing.  It's a shame I can't look forward to any new books from him.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Not too bad for a free game. Upgrade levels could come vfaster. Pretty good tho. Def good on any phone. Twenty words are needed.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green's book is incredible. I don't have a ton of time to read but when I do I read his novels. Love it. It is the first novel I've read with someone who has cancer where the book isn't about cancer.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this book because my 21 year old daughter asked me too. It is very good all though so deeply about life, really makes one think about choices you make in your life. The two main characters did not get choices. They were given diseases very young in life. But these two wanted to feel what real love is and they really did. Not physically but emotionally. I recommend to all ages. Not just young adults.
0062238868|5.0|I bought for a gift.  I was told the book was awesome. He finished it in two days and recommends to Anyone who is interested in this type of read.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Love this book and the exercises. The book inspired me to open my eyes and my mind  Great read !
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|This movie is a mix with magic and a robbery. They showed you how the elaborate tricks were done. It's hard to find a good pg-13 movie.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is a great book about a great man. Adam Brown was an American Hero, he overcame addiction and 2 injuries to serve our country.
B00DWZHTRW|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately there was just not enough coherent story to make it work for me. The tricks were cool but the story was weak.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have tried quite a few keyboards for my Droid phones &amp; tablets. SwiftKey is thee best replacement keyboards for Android. This is in the top 5 must have Android apps! After a little while it's predictive feature knows what word you are going to type. Get it!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Great book.  I would definitely recommend this for those that love fiction, stories about family and love.
B009ZQI41C|5.0|Not sure if I like the ending of the series.  Can't we have one or two happy endings for anyone?  I would like to see more of the joy that occurs, but I guess drama sells.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|It was a very good book and it was a good sequel to the first book. It followed the storyline well and did not stretch the story out.
B006MW3VC4|5.0|Each character is multi-dimensional.  Love the subtle drama and the developments.  Highly recommend watching this series.  The stories move along well.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|It Bella, Edward & Jake........They rock.  Well written, well directed, great storyline & awesome acting.  What more can you say.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|It is a series that you never can guess what is going to happen next. I love that. Can't wait to see the rest of the series.
B009LDCXQQ|5.0|Back to basics in this season. Sam and Dean back to form and Crowley sticks around too. Looking forward to season 9.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I just started using it a few days ago and thus far seems alright. I didn't notice it was slow as others remarked but we will see. i think google is fantastic so I felt confident could be a great product.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|this game is fun but the puzzles don't last long enough and there is a lot of reading needs more finding hidden objects!
B008MM9630|4.0|Starts slow, wish quests given could actually be completed within a level or 2 not 20. Sucks when you have to be away from the game when plants mature and you have to use all your energy or buy more.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|phenomenally bad plot, acting, etc....but who the hell cares....nobody bought or saw this movie for any of that...it delivers where it counts and OMG wow...just wow...girls night in with my best friends and cocktails not pun intended...and a successful night!
B006P0FICE|5.0|I have always liked Three Musketeers movies.  When I saw the preview  of The Three Musketeers  with flying battleships, I was Intrigued.  I was not disappointed.  Fun movie to watch time and again
B00FPH6A70|5.0|This is one of the best horror movies that I have seen in a long time (without all the gore and the blood) great all around . Would watch again and again.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|If you are a fan of the original Star Trek (CAPT Kirk and crew) you have to love the new series.
B001FQIWSK|5.0|What an unexpected delight.  Watch it and see for yourself, words cannot do it justice.  Hopeful and heartbreaking.  Loved it!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This version is much better than the 1st game.  graphics are much better and and i love the indiana jones mineing cart ride
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I love all the &#34;updated&#34; characters from the new Star Trek. They are very true to the original and yet have their own spin. This story continues the relationship building that began in the first movie. The story is excellent and the acting is wonderful. If you love sci-fi, this story is sure to please.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I deleted it from my kindle so maybe I could get all the updates but now it won't let me log back in it says error take to long try it again in a bit I deleted it over and over and still nothing but I love kik I have it since like January but idk what happened please fix it please asap.!!!!!!!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Well if u read my weaphones REVIEW, THEN u know what I am thinking. FANTASTIC. Those of you who bought the app surely agree. its amazing. those of you who haven't bought it yet should, along with the original weaphones, because your missing out. this app makes me feel like a solider in the marine core during WWII. its one of my favorites, along with weaphones the original. hours of endless fun. bravo OranginalPlan. good luck's to you and your next weaphones Sim. thank you soooooo much for this amazing app. btw please add a better shotgun to the original weaphones would appreciate it. thanks
B0047WJ12K|5.0|A movie that has many layers (literally and figuratively). I watched it once and my co-workers and I talked about it at lunch for one week.<br /><br />Watching it is a transcendent movie experience. You don't just watch this and simply walk away. Great movie.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I have loved uno since my childhood. This game is perfect. Some of the objectives or bonuses are crazy but I still love it.
B0089LOG02|3.0|What shall I say except it is a nice book. Nothing memorable to say the least.<br />I would have preferred to know more of the plight of the immigrants in their new found home. Instead that was skimmed over.  I will not be recommending it however.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Great to be able to watch a movie just purchased on my computer especially when you see a movie you really want to see right away love amazon instant video
B007X6SMD6|1.0|Too vague, like a bunch of landing pages with links out to more resources that are similarly vague on specific topics.<br />It is a starting point, but don't expect too much from this document - it won't actually get you started & using AWS - there's a lot more reading to do before you'll be able to put all those pieces of knowledge together to do anything.
B00F52YOPA|4.0|Grest hidden mystery game but would like more rooms to decorate. Also more choices of objects. Then 5 stars. Good start.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|An all time classic, the acting is top notch.  Characters are still relavant. One of the few films that I relish seeing again and again.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|If you like something different, someone who has talent, under the radar, but still known, this is the one for you. She has  a modern approach with her beats but her voice is so retro its cool. She has a thing for the bad guys, and boy does she sound smexy singing about it. Pretty lyrical, pretty face, pretty sweet tunes. I listen to alot of different music, I like electronic music, Rock, Dance, and trance. So if you like Christina Perry, my wife says she is similar, good CD, definitely worth the extra bucks to get the paradise edition.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I love this movie. I love it, I love it, I love it. I saw it eight times in the theatre. It's not without its flaws, certainly, but it's one of the few films to come out in recent years that I can watch over and over, and still find something new in it. The cast is excellent, especially Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain. He brings an amazing depth and menace to Khan, as well as a surprisingly vulnerability. And I can never say enough in praise of Simon Pegg. His Scotty is fantastic.
B0063GORYU|3.0|A little more challenging to navigate on my phone, but it's fun.  Don't really care for the annoying ads, but what free games can you get nowadays that doesn't have them?  I always seem to accidentally click on an ad whenever I play a game.  This one I seemed to do a lot.  But it's still fun.
B00745QIDC|4.0|It's very nice, fits my drawing tablet well (it should, it was designed for it). It's also very sturdy. My only real problems with it are that it can be difficult to get the cord in the holder, and the case itself is made of a very thick felt, which I really don't like the feel of. Lastly, the velcro on the flap is very strong . . . but also very loud! If you need to be quiet when opening it, this will be difficult for you.
B009VLX8FS|3.0|It's an above average album. The hit singles are great but the non-commercial releases weren't that good, especially the second-half of the album. Taylor's 2009 Fearless (5-star classic) had both great singles and good non-single tracks.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is one of my granddaughter's favorite games to play now! She enjoys practicing spelling as well as playing the game.

0061122416|4.0|The Alchemist is a charming fable. Read it to refresh your own joy in life.<br /><br />The introduction by author Paul Chelho identifies four reasons that people fail to achieve their dreams. Abbreviating his eloquent description, they are low self-esteem, self-inhibition, fear of failure, and guilt over success.<br /><br />In the story Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy, faces each of these four challenges in the course of his quest. Each time he overcomes an obstacle, he struggles with his desire to rest and enjoy the fruits of his labors, the company of a lover, or to return to his peaceful former existence as a wandering shepherd. His heart and the voice of the world (intuition) push him onwards towards his goal. The journey takes him far from home, through both danger and boredom, poverty and fleeting wealth, and finally to a meeting with the alchemist. As it turns out, Santiago discovers his own unique alchemy that consists of living in the moment, listening to his heart and acting on his dreams.<br /><br />The writing flows beautifully. The story moves along at a good pace with minimal flashbacks. Most of the conflicts are in the form of indecision in Santiago's mind, which rings true to life. Dialog is direct, not ingenious, but mainly to move the story along. There are few surprises, other than Santiago's cleverness. If one tries to dissect the story according to the dictates of traditional fiction-writing, it comes up short. Yet it is a great book that obviously has touched millions of people. The very simplicity of the characters, situations and mystical story line combined with the universal appeal of a young man's adventures are the secret of its success. I rate it four stars.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Like all the other subway surfers.. This game is adaddictive. My only problem is it wouldn't let me update...so now I have to start all over again..
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Excellent book!! Great read for a book club discussion. Wonderful memorable characters. Completely different perspective on Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.
B008YW5RH2|4.0|Daily challenge is what makes this game great. It's challenging also. Although I don't like that no matter how perfect and timely your shot is, YOU WILL NOT BEAT the better players without having to upgrade (purchase) your racket.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I can play vidoe on Netflix, Youtube etc. from my phone, no wires and it's the size of a flash drive.  Magic!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I want a Kindle, but for now, that will have to wait for a future date. This app is the next best thing.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Creative and engaging but I find it difficult to review &#34;Steal Like an Artist&#34; because the book is an amalgamation of advice, anecdotes, and uncommon sense. Austin Kleon writes in an easy-to-follow style, instructing readers about how to be creative without talking down to anyone. In fact while I read the book, I felt like I was part of some secret creators club, with this book as the secret club manual.
B0058DRSHW|5.0|It's a really interesting book that can help every employee in a company, from the trainee to the president, improving the way people think the business.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|Another great singer and this Black and White night is a true winner.  It is good for all times.  The DVD is amazing.  Elaine in TEXAS!
B005R2N20Q|5.0|My daughter was 10 when she asked her brother to give her this CD for Xmas. So we listened to this beautiful music together when she was doing yoga or before sleeping.<br />Now this music is a memory of the good time we spent together.<br />Heloisa

B00FJTYDKK|3.0|I have to sit through lots of kid movies. Some are mind numbing other are quite funny and engaging. This one was somewhere in the middle. Not painful but definitely not great.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love my little pony's. but why not receive more gems from throw pony in the box??? ;)I'm 48.<br />it's. great fun!!!!!!!! :)
B005DOJ68K|5.0|What can I say?  Creedence Clearwater Revival is an iconic group whose music is classic; and these songs are the best of the best of their original recordings.  The sixties and seventies were the counter culture years, during which many of us came of age.  Creedence and their music have become part of our cultural literacy.
B008Y212PI|5.0|It keeps my mind sharp. Good game! This game really makes you stop and think and does requie some strategy on the bigger puzzles. I recomend this for young and old alike!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Excuse my seemingly impious expression but I believe I'm pardoned considering my subjectively vehement worship to Him.  I have to say this is the best app on my device save the Bible. I'm cognizant of the fact that when you delete something off your device it's not actually deleted but just marked as such. Having this knowledge and seeing I had 114 Megabytes on my device it didn't make sense. I did the math and I was being robbed of approximately 2.0 GB. My ability to do something about it was in the idiotic confines of my warranty which was limited. This app cleared not only my estimated space but by far exceeded expectations; an addition 289.0 Mg (Megabytes) was freed. This app is amazing. You would be a fool not to get it.
B0042816YK|5.0|I really like this movie. it is abit different then the book but it still is a good movie just the same. I read the book after I seen the movie would recommend this to anyone.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|besides the occasional force close, this game is. pretty sweet. no need to buy gems if you have friends that also play and/or are willing to share your accomplishments via facebook or twitter. I just love my DragonVale park :)
B0084TWN9K|2.0|I read most of the stories in this book before I learned she won the Nobel prize...but I did not like them.  People acted in ways that, to me, made no sense. The ends left me hanging.  Perhaps the last 4 that are said to be more autobiographical will be better.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Very good book with many plot twists. Definitely a page turner. Make sure you have the next book when you finish this one because it leaves you with a very good cliff hanger
B003L5BRXK|4.0|The Stones haven't always been my favorite, but I love the raw simplicity and playfulness of Exile on Main Street. I have a 5 year old grandson who totally rocked out while listening to this download. He was probably just imitating me. I know, it's only rock n roll, but I like it!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Like to play to relax.  Confused about how to complete tasks.  Sometimes it just pops up that I solved something.  I just keep looking for items in the rooms.  I HAVE NOT SPENT ANY MONEY.  I just wait til i get more energy.  It takes patience to play without buying.  I wish there was a way to win more diamonds.  Don t know how those different castles and things show up in the yard.  I never got to go in those yet. Will continue to play searching for items and trying new rooms.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I totally love these books and the movies!!!!!<br />When I finished the first time I crude when it ended it didn't want to let go of the too cute love story!
B00DPH7QFM|1.0|very mediocre show.  away from Ritchie Blackmore's guitar playing, nothing much here.  Where is bobby and Joe?  or Even Ronnie?<br />not enough of the classic Rainbow on the CD and candace night is in the credit, but where is she on the video?<br />This is a masquerade all right of an imitation of an once superb band lead by Ritchie Blackmore.
0312944926|1.0|I must begin by saying that I enjoy Dan Brown's books. Even when I must suspend my incredulity in the face of obvious factual errors; the plot and excitement are usually quite fun. As a systems analyst I was willing to do that with this book as well; forgive me Grace Hopper! However, the formulaic plot line and shallow barely formed characters when piled on top of gross technical errors were just too much to bear. In the end a relatively young college professor so completely out of touch and naive about teenagers was just too unbelievable. I couldn't feel empathy for Becker when all I really wanted to do was pummel him for being such an out of touch idiot. The story just wasn't worth my time and trouble.
B004N7WJF0|5.0|cool concert by these old timers, and good response from the audience.  that's what makes a show excellent from the mediocre one, and this def is a hottie for a show.  scorpions really sting on this one.
B00COO2D6O|3.0|Game builds on the principals that made the first great. Only downside is the overly aggressive push to use social media.
B004JUTHVK|2.0|not enough of the good tracks were here that I saw on the video.  and even price wise, dvd was cheaper than the cd itself.  i thought the songs were going to be the same as the dvd, but the cd contained fewer songs, and the songs are the same as from the dvd, no remixing, nothing.  infact, for some strange reason, the songs on the cd sounded a bit flat, like dead, while the sound on the dvd was live and vibrant.  something a miss here.  probably be better off extracting the audio tracks from the dvd and then placing it on your mp3 or ipod/ipad.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This Constant Reader is amazed at this novel. It's not the typical scare the scrap out of you to where you need a night-light and therapy..but it's very intense. Like all of his books, I just couldn't put it down.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love it!  Such a fun game but it's hard to get some of the things you need. Very fun though
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I bought the special edition at Best Buy to get the bonus tracks, the DVD - Reconciliation and the T-shirt.  The T-Shirt was XL in size which is perfect for me.<br /><br />The DVD isn't too long (maybe a half hour), but offers insight and interviews on Head rejoining the band and the process of recording and writing the album.<br /><br />The album is full of great songs that combine really catchy and poppy choruses with the typical insane heavy rhythm section that Korn invented.  The production adds a few electronic bits here and there as dynamic add ons, but nothing that drives the majority of the song like on the Path of Totality.<br /><br />The writing is typical Korn with emotional and dark lyrics and the choruses again stand out as nearly all the songs could be radio hits but with killer heavy riffing and heavy growling vocals mixed in.  All members sound fantastic in this album, but the only downside for me were there are no insane \\"Twist\\" or \\"Freak on a Leash\\" vocal moments or prominent bagpipes (which I wish they would do more of), but the songs are still very well composed and produced.<br /><br />This may be my favorite Korn album as a whole since I can listen to the whole thing without skipping over songs that I don't care for.  Despite having many similar elements of the first three albums, it is most similar to Issues and Untouchables era to me so if you like them, this album will blow your mind.
B000T433CO|5.0|Although this doesn't happen to people with ordinary jobs, it is fun to watch. It gives you a time to fantasize and truly enjoy events and perspectives from different sides of the ocean. Jack Black and Kate Winslet bring innocence to a very romantic time and place, while Cameron Diaz and Jude Law redefine who they are and what they really want of life. A delightful lighthearted romantic comedy that you can watch regardless of the time of year.
B0035QUXWQ|4.0|Excellent movie. Heartwarming and good for the family (not small children). True love shown in its most basic way.<br /><br />Enjoy
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the show and I am glad it was not expensive.  I read all the books and really enjoyed them, and heard of the show from a friend of mine so I decided I would try them. I am so glad I did.  Can't wait to watch the rest.
B0097JYVAU|4.0|If you are over 50 and male this could be the most important post you read this year.<br /><br />I have just finished reading The Signal and the Noise: The Art and Science of Prediction by Nate Silver.  The book discusses a how a diverse set of forecasts ranging from politics, baseball and the weather are prepared, the errors that are often made and how in many cases ‘expert predictions’ should be treated with many grains of salt.<br /><br />However a real strength of the book is the description of Bayesian reasoning in Chapter 8 which is a technique every manager should learn.  A lot of management effort is spent altering forecasts as new information is received Bayes allows to make better predictions.  This book made me really learn about Bayes Theorem.<br /><br />Simply put one takes a prior probility and compares it to a new event and obtains a posterior probability. Say x equals the prior probability, y equals a new event probability that is true, and z equals a new event probability that is false. The posterior probability is xy over xy plus (1-x)z.  The secret is calculating both the true and false positives.<br /><br />Say for example there has been an accident in a city involving a taxi cab.<br />* 85% of the cabs in the city are white, and 15% are silver.<br />* A man identified the cab involved in a hit and run as silver.<br />* The court tested the witness' reliability, and the witness was able to correctly identify the correct color 80% of the time, and failed 20% of the time.<br /><br />What is the probability the taxi cab was silver? Here's how we figure it out using Bayes theorem.<br /><br />If the cab was silver, a 15% chance, and correctly identified, an 80% chance, the combined probability is .15 * .8 = .12, a 12% chance.  These are true positives.<br />If the cab was white, an 85% chance, and incorrectly identified, a 20% chance, the combined probability is .85 * .2 = .17, a 17% chance.  These are false positives<br />Since the cab had to be either white or silver, the total probability of it being identified as silver, whether right or wrong, is .12 + .17 = .29. In other words, this witness could be expected to identify the cab as silver 29% of the time whether he was right or wrong.<br /><br />The chances he was right are .12 out of .29, or 41%.<br /><br />Now recently I took a PSA test and my reading was above the supposed danger level.  What is the probability I have prostate cancer?<br /><br />The chances of have prostate cancer at various ages are as follows:<br />For a man in his 40s -  1 in 1000<br />For a man in his 50s -  12 in 1000<br />For a man in his 60s -  45 in 1000<br />For a man in his 70s -  80 in 1000<br /><br />I am 69 so my chances of prostate cancer would be 63 in 1000.  However I have now had a positive PSA test result.<br /><br />Now according to a medical website for every 100 men over age 50, with no symptoms, who have the PSA test:<br /><br />10 men out of 100 tested will have a higher than normal level of PSA. These men must then go through other tests and examinations. At the end of these tests :<br />• Three of the ten men with a higher than normal PSA level will be found to have prostate cancer<br />• Seven of the 10 men with a higher than normal PSA level will be found not to have prostate cancer at the time of screening<br /><br />90 men out of 100 tested will have a normal PSA level. Of these 90 men :<br />• 88 of the men with a normal PSA level will not have prostate cancer.<br />• One or two of the men with a normal PSA level will actually have prostate cancer, undetected by the test.<br /><br />The probability that the PSA test gives a true positive for me is 0.063 x 88/90 or 0.0616 (xy in the formula; note two people out of 90 are missed.)<br /><br />The probability that the PSA test gives a false positive for me is 0.927 x .07 or 0.0656 ((1-x)z in the formula.<br /><br />The sum of the true and false positives is 0.1272 and so according to Bayes the probability that I have prostate cancer is 48% which is much higher than I originally thought and means that I will go forward with a biopsy.  I never would have come to this conclusion without reading Silver's book<br /><br />I did find the final chapter of climate science to be weak.  I confess I am a sceptic but Silver tries to justify Climategate and in my opinion fails badly.  As reviewer Robert has noted the Climategate scandal had nothing to do with the global temperatures, the greenhouse effect, or basic climate science.  Climategate is all about how some prominent scientists fudged data, erased embarrassing results, and sought to control the peer review process in leading scientific journals to suffocate dissenting opinions.<br /><br />Indeed the proponents of Climategate sound very similar to political pundits that Silver so effectively lacerates in the first chapter of his book.ility that I have prostate cancer is 48% which is much higher than I originally thought and means that I will go forward with a biopsy.

B00FPH6AXE|1.0|This movie is sappy, and has no excitement what so ever. It is horrible. Don't waste your money or your time. SKIP IT! Even if you love will smith you'll keep asking yourself,..\\"Why does everyone have a funny accent\\" Nothing is worthwhile in this movie. Nothing.
B00004YA66|5.0|This movie is one of my husband's all time favorites. we had a copy but he watched it so often it was no longer working.<br />I ordered this movie and received it all in the same week. I was very pleased with the service.

B0035HKWLW|5.0|I am in agreement with all the other positive reviews about this movie so I add the following.  This review is written about a funny, entertaining and maybe with even a little insight, movie during a time when a movie like this could not be made without all the political correct objectionable odes present in a film today.  Odes like to visual graphic sex, graphic violence, anti-Americanism where the world is good and America is bad, an evil, corrupt American government unit responsible for all the bad things that happen, always the evil corporation and the new ode to homosexual couples that seems to be required in every entertainment today or it does not get made.  I thought Liar  - Liar was even better but this movie was good.  There may not be movies like this made again without all the politically-correct themes injected into the movie.  Last of the non-Walt Disney films for the family.
B00493E1GI|4.0|I watched this movie while vacationing in Bali (cliche I know).  I have yet to read the book but I am certain the book is a lot better than the movie.  That aside, this movie was worth the watch.  The lessons that were emphasized in this movie, although simple, are too often forgotten.  Appreciating these simple mottos could lead to some tremendous changes in your outlook on life and the way you approach certain situations that you are faced with.  There were definitely points where tears were brought to my eyes and times when it made me smile.  Overall, I enjoyed the scenes and acting.  Well worth the watch! Cheers

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|a typical Clancy novel - I like his style - in my opinion he cannot be beat for this type of book.  All the suspense,  mystery, thriller, without an overdose of language, sex and violence for the sake of violence.  Still a Jack Ryan fan - Sr and Jr.  I and many others will miss this author RIP
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best game ever so do you like it<br />Like it so I am It is the best game ever
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Second book in a great (so far) series by Suzanne Collins. I can't wait to get the next book in the series. It only took me about 6 hours over 2 late nights to read this exciting book. I felt the fact that the winners of the hunger games had to up against each other in a best of the best type situation was a little contrived to create more excitement, but at the same time it sounded just like something a government like the one depicted in these books would do.
B00EXVZZE8|4.0|I think it's a great game but you pay &cent;99 but  it still has adds not fair a d it's like d noodle jump and temple run mixed together.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is a great tribute concert to one of the great Beatles. George was such a compassionate person and thoughtful songwriter, that it's wonderful to hear all these super performer paying homage to his music. Great audio quality and super visuals.
B009361C5O|5.0|The tablet version: so far so good. Absolutely no complaints; simple, clear and clean. Excellent.<br /><br />Have AVG Tune-Up on my PC; has been great and saved me buying a new one.<br />My 8 year old PC is as fast and clean as the day I bought it and no need to upgrade.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have to say that I loved this book.  Perfect sequel to The Shining.  Stephen, you did a great job.  I am not going to go<br />into the story because I do not want to spoil it for others who have not read it but I usually can tell what is going to happen<br />in books and I was quite surprised when I found out a few things.  I truly liked the AA references, I guess maybe cause it is close to<br />my heart. (I have a family member in recovery.  But the story itself is really good.  I have read all of Stephens books and some of course<br />I like better than others but I have always loved the way he writes.  This book is one of his better ones in my opinion. (Some people will<br />disagree, but that is okay we are all different).<br />Now is it possible to see a sequel to The Stand????
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game and can't stop playing it! I rated it five stars, because this game deserves five stars. Why do I have to give a twenty word opinion?
B0036S4B6M|5.0|A wonderful show with such power house actors. It really is a top notch show. Taylor Schilling plays Piper so well.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|One of my favorite series of books of all time. I've read the whole series at least twice and I will read them again one day. I was hoping to replace my beat up paperbacks, that take up a whole book shelf with the Kindle versions but absolutely not at this price. That would be nearly $200. Simply crazy.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|I love how you can move the things by your self instead of clicking it and having the computer do it.
B003BWNC5E|5.0|This was used to upgrade a Samsung Q1 Ultra UMPC from a 60GB HDD to the 120 GB SDD.  The Q1 is not a very fast PC by today's standard as it is; but, this did make a lot of difference.<br /><br />My only complaint is that KingSpec does not ship software or provide a downloadable link for formatting and cloning from another HDD or SSD.  That is provided by other manufacturers ... usually a limited version of Acronis' True Image software.<br /><br />It is worthy enough; however, to use on an OQO upgrade.<br /><br />5 stars for increase in speed.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Challenging and fast. Still not as good as candy crush. Amazon needs to get candy crush! But this is entertaining.
B00EP22QKG|5.0|This is the first Joan Jett album i have purchased since i bought I Love Rock n Roll when i was a kid.  It sounds like it could be a new Runaways album.  The songs are very sing-songey type with great melodies.  They are short, perfect little pop tunes with hand claps and everything....very memorable little dittes.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Despite that this series is filmed in the old style of feeling like a stage play , it draws me into the lives of the characters.  For the most part, very well acted and interesting story-lines. I saw some of the episodes when they originally came out and still find them enjoyable and not too dated to be fun.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|It is clear, concise and to the point. I highly recommend it.  It is a very useful guide to anyone who wishes to start a business eventually.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A fully developed  story when the characters didn't have much time left to be developed on. A good, simple read.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|This is a very interesting take not only on science fiction, but on storytelling and influences large and small. The title is more of a metaphor than a direct reference to Star Trek, this is not a book about Captain Kirk. It is funny, interesting, and a very breezy read.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|This is a Classic Younger people have never seen it and should.  Story Line is Great with Superb Casting.  Farreh Foster's first movie as Holly.  Michael York & Peter Ustinof were Excellent.  The ending was Beautiful and the Scenery was out of this World.  I would highly recommend it.  I received 2 in the same box and was billed for 2 and so I returned one.
034580404X|5.0|Bought it for my g/f and need I say more? She didn't put it down till she was finished all three. She even llent it around at work.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I was so excited when discovered this app was available on amazon.  It wasn't when I know it was first released.  I checked a couple of days later and there it was.  Thank You Jehovah, it saved me from having to buy a new tablet.  This app is wonderful. It is just like the actual Bible only better, cause you can see the other translations just by tapping the scripture, footnotes are readily available.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|So this movie made me feel a little guilty for being overprotective of my kids... but I loved it anyhow and so did they.
B0014I4KIK|3.0|I was hoping that more songs were like the one that I bought it for....I still enjoy it very well
B005PK56TA|5.0|Awesome series!!! cant wait to see the next season.kinda wish Season Two was on my Amazon Prime. what a bummer
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|This cd is a Christmas gift for my son,,,I plan to get him a new cd stereo for Christmas as well
B005DN5BE4|5.0|Dealing with very hard issues that &#34;our&#34; generation never knew the depths of, if we ever thought about<br />it at at all...<br /><br />The forceful removal of an indigenous people from their homeland, and treated cruelly, and then<br />brought across half a world to become slaves to the upper classes...I won't tell it all, you have<br />to see it, to live it...<br /><br />Superb acting!!  It pulls you in and you stay there through the hard and tough things and<br />I won't spoil it by telling you the end.  IT'S A MUST WATCH FOR SURE!!!  And of course<br />Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors of all time.
B008UX2UIO|5.0|Say hello to your favorite misunderstood lunatic genius!<br /><br />This book will never die! Thankfully, neither will Ignatius!<br /><br />JUST READ IT!
030758836X|1.0|Bought book like everyone else because of the high reviews... I don't read a ton of books regularly but like books to keep me on my toes.. and this seemed to be one of them... Initially. I did finish reading it anyhow but midway through the book - the author shifts the story line by revealing almost too much... then the details supporting the revelation .. were all so unnecessary and ended up being a -not-sure-why-I-am-still-reading-this-book book. I guess it was just to get to the end ... but VERY disappointed since I was hoping the ending would somehow fix the rest of it..
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Pretty tough game. Game gets harder as you keep playing. Make sure you save as many of the coins as possible.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Regardless on what anyone says, this headset is top notch.  With all the drivers installed, all the buttons and everything work magnificently.  The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 was due to the charge in the headset doesn't keep its lengthy charge for very long.  I've used it for around 6 months now, and it's about half of what it used to be (which is understandable with batteries).  Another reason is due to the software doesn't allow hotkeys of your own to be added to the headset.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World (and Fall of Giants) reminded me of &#34;Winds of War&#34;. It is an excellent portrait of troubled times, as seen through the eyes of widely different characters along several generations. I can only hope that the third volume is up to the same level.
0765365278|5.0|This book starts out very slow, but its informational.  The first 200 to 300 pages require some discipline due to just understanding the mass amount of characters and story plots with in this master piece.  Once I continued past that barrier, I read the next 800 to 900 pages in a matter of three days....it literally was that good.  Sandersons's creativeness behind his magic systems and plot twists are so mind boggling (in an amazing way).  HBO should make this into a series.<br /><br />Refer to my Subject, this book is the best book you will ever read ( if you are into a fantasy style book)
B007HPO3CC|3.0|If you never read any of the books, this may take a while to get into...and to understand.  The videos have some helpful bonus features to explain things...but.... If you like the fantasy land kind of thing you'd probably like it.  if you don't care for that kind of thing pass...its takes a lot of work to get going.....
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I gave this a 3 out of 5 due to its grooves don't do much for your knife.  I found that the rod actually worked a lot better keeping my knifes edge.  Overall though worth the buy for a good travel sharpener.
B008B37C8Q|5.0|Classic early Frank!!  Hearing this as a pre-teen I did not fully appreciate or understand  Frank's satire and whit.  Coming back to this now I can truthfully say Frank was ahead of the game.  Not only does he poke fun of the cultural and political atmosphere of the times you can hear early emergence of many of the compositional traits we all love from Frank Zappa!
0061733199|4.0|This is a great book to take with most hikes, and backpacking trips.  Yes the weight will be an issue, but it has multiple area knowledge for food / plants / wildlife that helps even the most experienced traveler.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This game is good for me because it lets me know how sharp I am and at the same time relaxes me
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Loved every minute of this book.  Showing his hard demeanor and work ethic.  I loved how he is so humble and his when he stated &#34;He just got lucky with his assignments&#34;.  That is so true, you do not choose where you go and what variables in life come your way.  Great man, sad to see he was murdered trying to help his fellow countrymen.
B0035YDM4Y|2.0|I certainly didn't enjoy this as much as 'American Sniper'. I felt at times that it was overly padded out for effect I.e. how can someone possibly remember the many hundreds of push ups they did, years previously. I also had a issue with what I thought was over exaggeration when describing the fire fight almost to the point of remembering each and every shrub, stone, wall that he hid behind.<br />The amount of ammunition also seemed to be inexhaustible. However, in saying this, I looked Luttrell up on Google and found that what happened, actually happened and that he is indeed a very brave man. There are better written books on the subject.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|I've read this book a few times and still laugh out loud at some parts. If you're looking for a relaxing, fun read, this is it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great fairly challenging app it is very addictive.  The puzzle are engaging without being to difficult great for long plane rides and trips
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|It is so great to see the classic stars singing some of the Oldies...Motown is an Icon, Michael is an Icon, and certainly did the songs justice.  Nice twist on the music, listen to the music as often as I can.  It is wonderful.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Awesome game. I figured out a way to beat the airplane game if u have a kindle u just shake your kindle, ps the people look like hot dogs
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|Forrest's &#34;stupid&#34; but enduring love of Jenny is frustrating, but you know in your heart that that's how love should work.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I have only played a few games, but like the challenge that it presents.  Watching the hints and you can finish quicker.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|At the end of this book George Martin explains why this book is structured as it is. All I can say is that there had to be another way. Painful read. Aggravatingly slow, little to no plot. Only good news - Book 5 is much better.
B005CRY2O6|4.0|Great recipes, untraditional mixes which I appreciate. I am allergic to gluten and dairy, and have to find substitutes for that, but that is a small issue. All together it is very good!
B004OCCFFI|5.0|One of the best, (if not the best) Fidelio recordings.  Kaufmann and Stemme excel as do the other singers and orchestra.  Highly recommended.
1400032717|5.0|This compelling novel introduces us to Christopher, a 15 year old with autism. Through his first-person narration we learn  about the world those with autism inhabit, why much of their behavior, perplexing to us, makes perfect sense to them, what responses from us are helpful and which only escalate a bad situation. Told with warmth and humor, we discover that Christopher is very bright, quite clever, and determined to be a problem-solver.
B00BT70J7M|5.0|The world's best tenor continues his triumphant journey through the Verdi repertoire. An excellent recording on all accounts. The artist and orchestra are in top form. The selections are sure to please.  Highly recommended.
B00C5R8364|5.0|This is another good read by this author.  I've enjoyed his work for years, and this book was no exception.
B0001XPZGA|4.0|I bought this on vinyl because I have a record player now. I have avoided this album since its early years because I had a nasty break up and the guy was obsessed with this album. And how do you forget about a nerdy geophysicist who lied to you about being single and unmarried? You send him &#34;You Oughta Know&#34; on a CD for his birthday immediately after the breakup and banish from your life the album he obsessed over.<br /><br />But I'm over it. Been over it for 10 years. Welcome back, Norah's debut album. I'm older and wiser and I can come away with you now.
B00E9P959O|4.0|I love Vapor Trails - I think there are some strong tunes on this record and I was very much looking forward to the remixed version. After listening to it three times through and going back to the original once to compare, I agree with the 'some good/some bad' review of this remix. It's certainly great to hear some of the stuff that got buried in the 'wall of sound' that was present on the original, but that wall of sound grew on me - I actually like it for what it is. The biggest standout on this remix is Neil's ride cymbal - as in - where did it go? It's essentially missing from the entire record now or is way, way in the back of the mix. For example,  the chorus during Peaceable Kingdom is lacking the same groove it once had since that ride isn't really there anymore. Still though - there's some great guitar and vocal work that's like new since we never really heard it before. Overall - a nice attempt that yields a good alternate version of the record, but the original still has it's strengths as well and each can be enjoyed for what they are - sort of like Let It Be versus Let It Be (Naked).
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Oblivion is a great Sci Fi movie with a an actual story.  Now it is not a Popcorn Sci Fi movie.  It is a story told in a Sci Fi setting.  It is one with a good story, a story with ups and downs, but overall it weaves everything together nicely by the end.  I do feel the ending was rushed.  Considering the movie length I cannot say I am surprised.  They could have shorten some of the bits in the middle to allow for a more composed ending in the style of the movie.  It was like they had to wrap it up and the did the best that they could with the time remaining.<br /><br />The acting was on point, the visuals were great.  I actually felt for the characters.  I was really interested in the universe that was being created.  That could be the reason I felt the ending was rushed.<br /><br />Speaking of which I did not see the fun at the end coming, but should have.  They foreshadowed it and everything.  That how into the story that I was.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Apple Tv is 100 times better. all you can send from the ipad is from the youtube app or the netflix app.  I have apple TV and anything i can get on my Ipad I can sent to my tv with Apple TV.  Chromecast has to conect to your wifi as well it is not indepedent from your network. For netflix or you streaming it would be fine.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is amazing. I had a few troubles but customer support fixed me up in no time. play this game!!!!!
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Favorite show ever!!! Must see. I can't watch it over and over and over. Competes with Battle Star Galactica. Yes!
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Do I really need to explain why The Goonies gets a 5 star rating?  Simply an 80s classic.  On top of that it speaks volumes that I have never had The Goonies come up in a conversation and have someone say 'nah, I don't like that movie'. That's never happend. Not once.
B0026IUXME|5.0|Great Movie ...story line is moving...a holocaust movie...but so amazingly depicted. Still not enough music as I thought there would be given the title...
B000IKQK7E|5.0|I first watched \\"Animal House\\" at a theater the month it was released and have seen it several times since over the course of the years. It's kept me laughing each time I've watched it. But it's more than a funny film. There are a lot of funny films out there. What makes \\"Animal House\\" special is its slightly overdrawn but mostly accurate portrayal of college life. As someone who spent four years in college, an additional four years in grad school, and nearly three decades teaching at the college level, I resonate fully with the men of the Delta fraternity, who wind up getting the best of the self-important stuffed shirts in the administration as well as the egotistical BMOC's, who seemingly inhabit every college campus and form their own exclusive fraternity.<br /><br />Every character, from Bluto (John Belushi) and Flounder to the humorless Dean Wormer to the jaded pot-smoking English teacher (Donald Sutherland), while perhaps a bit of a caricature, nevertheless represents a species on the typical college campus. And, like every former student (except perhaps the self-important few), I have rooted for the underdogs to stick it to \\"The Man.\\" And this is exactly what the Delta house does in a way both hilarious and fitting.<br /><br />The fact that this film has engendered knockoffs such as \\"Road Trip\\" and \\"Old School\\" is testimony to its landmark status and its enduring value.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|The only complaint I had was it a too revealing  sex scene with her bad boyfriend.  I don't think that was necessary.  I would not let my granddaughter watch.  The acting (especially the main young man character) was very good.  I would like to have had more music.
B00ENYKBD0|5.0|\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is the story of John Nash, the brilliant but eccentric Princeton mathematician who over the years descends into schizophrenia, to the point of imagining that he is tracking an international conspiracy of an undetermined sort. As other reviewers have pointed out, the story is not true to Nash's life in every way, making him to appear a better person than he was in real life. However, as a portrayal of schizophrenia and how it affects the mind, it is most compelling. One of its most outstanding features is that it presents what is happening from the perspective of Nash himself, so that for a time we are not sure whether what we are observing (through his eyes) is fact or fiction. This is especially true of the characters in the movie who turn out to be nothing more than products of his mind. Is his grad school roommate real? How about the little girl he befriends? And then what about the conspiracy that he thinks he is tracking? At first we are even taken in by this. Seldom has schizophrenia been portrayed as realistically as it is in this film.<br /><br />We also see the importance of having a community of people who are willing to accept the schizophrenic person. His wife, his colleagues, and his students are all supportive and certainly instrumental in his ability to function at a high level despite his debilitating illness.<br /><br />Russell Crowe does an outstanding job of portraying Nash, as does Jennifer Connelly his wife. The acting itself makes this worth watching.
B000I9WWCM|5.0|Hugh Grant was so good in this movie.  I liked Julia but he played this role perfectly to make it believable.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|A film that should never have been made.  Admittedly never read the graphic comic series, and the Stallone version was hardly watchable back in the 90's, but was better than this mess.
B009CGCQPU|5.0|The was the best Pride & Prejudice ever made.  The acting was the best from all the actors.  They fit their roles completely
1574214276|4.0|These were purchased for my wife who loves them She spends hours drawing and creating new pieces. She enjoys art projects and these are no exception. Above average product.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Intelligent, witting, sharp.  Unexpected plot twists keep me hooked.  It is a study in corporate politics and power in big business.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Spent hours of having fun meeting interesting people. A lot of informative information from very smart people from various parts of the world.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I finished this book quite a while ago, and the characters and plot are still with me.  This was a highly imaginative, suspenseful, and layered story.  The plot, pacing, and characters kept me reading late into the night!
B00F5F0208|5.0|I like the mix of R&B and Rap on this album<br />I hope Drake does a solid R&B album next
B000I9X668|2.0|Fellow cubicle dwellers told me this movie was hilarious and that I would completely relate.  Instead, it seemed stupid and shallow.  Sorry.
B002RUA524|5.0|The book had me laughing out loud and was the perfect holiday companion. The book is well written and the author Gerald Durrell is able to bring the world of nature vividly to life.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not as exciting as previous John Grisham books.  I guess this is true when different authors try to mimic Grisham's older books when he was the original author and not like it is when he puts his name to someone else.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Best of the Iron Man movie!  Penny finally fights back.  Tony shows he is vulnerable.  New characters.  Good plot twist.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|I remember some of these events - at least the headlines written about them, but had no idea about the back story and how close we came to catastrophe. I live in Albuquerque, home of Sandia National Labs, and have visited the Nuclear museum several times over the past 30 years. There, you can see the actual damages casings of the H bombs lost near the coast of Spain. But the details uncovered by Schlosser were chilling - especially when he described the military's resistance to incorporating the safety features developed at the Lab. Some of the original PAL devices can be seen at the museum.<br /><br />The only negative from my perspective was the narrative about the &#34;Damascus incident&#34; - where the Titan II missile blew up in Arkansas. Yes there was heroism displayed by missile maintenance technicians during this event, but I thought the drama and first-person story telling went a bit overboard. I saw Schlosser being interviewed on C-Span's book review program and he was asked &#34;who will make the movie&#34; ? - presumably because the Damascus incident was covered more like a screen play than a historical description. I hope someone buys the rights and makes the movie.<br /><br />Both in the book and in that interview, Schlosser says he can only guess at the near-disasters which occurred in the Russian, Chinese, and other nuclear programs that presumably event less emphasis on weapon safety. The Pakistan and North Korean programs come to mind.
B00371XIJE|5.0|Hachi is a very touching, heartwarming movie based on a true story which took place in Japan. My 83 y.o. mother-in-law who has a hard time focusing on anything and falls asleep easily watched the entire movie in its entirety, quite engaged in the story of love between Hachi and the professor. Tearjerker. I would recommend for all ages. How nice to see a movie without sex and violence.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What else can you say about a Stephen King novel except for awesome?  I couldn't out it down.  I loved the twists in the story and how Dan turned out as an adult.  Can't wait to see what happens to Abra!  Is there another story there Mr. King?
B00FHAB3HW|5.0|The preview for this album did it absolutely no justice! I didn't think I would love this album until I listened to the full songs, and WOW did Miley did a great job. There are a ton of songs on this album that have such a deep meaning while others are just fun and playful. Once you start listening, you can't stop!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Dr. Perlmutter confirms and expands on the information in &#34;Wheat Belly&#34; book--wheat is an unnatural food that's addictive and damaging. He expands by explaining the damage to the brain of not only wheat but most grains, as well as excessive carbohydrates. The book is not only laden with heavy duty research, that makes sense to this lay person, but with help in how to get out of the damaging addictions of most carbs and grains.
B00EP0KBXM|1.0|I was expecting more from this movie but was quite disappointed with the acting, story line, and dialogue. At times, the story line was so slow and predictable that it mirrored a \\"B\\" movie. I love Scyfy but this movie was poorly done.
B006VREHRS|4.0|Interesting plot and character development. Period details are perfect. Great actors and intriguing story of lust for power, wealth and security.
0763655465|5.0|This is a great book about a dog who tries to control his impulses but keeps getting in trouble.  My five year old loves it and the illustrations are great.
B008Y2VTIS|3.0|Story getting more complicated with gangsters' geographic areas and identities often hard to follow. Lavish party scenes are spectacular. Enough character development to keep the plot interesting.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|My husband has been looking at this for a while and he loves it, it definitely helps with the line of work he is in.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|still finding out how it works but I am pleased with what I have been able to achieve so far
B00992CF6W|3.0|I like this app very much but it needs to be more like the xBox version like being able to go to Nether and The End. I would rate higher if it had these improvements
B000ICZD4I|5.0|Well movies are personal preference, so not sure how to rate this. I am very pleased with how fast it arrived and the price paid.  Can't wait to sit dwen and watch this movie.... Is been years since I've seen it!
B008602KQI|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie, story is a little freaky but kept you on edge of seat a must see if you like action
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I am a die-hard fan of the TV series on A&E but had never read any of the books.  I think I went into the book expecting them to be closely related--they're not.  The  personalities of the characters in Craig Johnson's book, particularly Walt Longmire, are much different.  Once I could shift my thinking about that, then I could dig in and enjoy it.  I will most definitely read more of the Johnson/Longmire books!

B00E687MWQ|1.0|I've been a big fan of this band from the beginning. I was super stoked to purchase this cd and was hoping they would pick up where \\"k.i.n.g\\"left off. I know being a black metal band that you're supposed to do things bas-akwards but they REALLY went backwards with this cd. I tried really hard to try and discover what satyr was trying to accomplish, but sadly I could not. There is nothing here to have you begging for more. The only begging you'll do, is beg for someone to turn it off. Extremely weak guitars and even weaker vocals. I'm truly disappointed to say to anyone wanting to grab this cd to save their money. Hell, it's not even worth stealing. I think Satyricon has passed their glory days, as satan has left the building....
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|I bought this for my daughter as soon as it was released, and she absolutely loves it. She is a huge Ariana Grande fan!
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Not a fan of the overabundance of runner games, but this one is a little different. I find that's it's just hard enough to keep me interested. It's a quick, simply game that you can take a stab at anytime you have a spare moment. Saves progress to come back later. Final stages take a while. Would not have been disappointed if I had paid for it!
B008AIGWVA|5.0|This is the cutest thing I have seen in a while, I love how you talk and he repeats what you say. he is so funny. My 2 year old grandson gets a kick out of watching him in action.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Funny! Funny! Funny!....but you already know that! Get a bowl of popcorn and a drink, sit and laugh. Although I know better, I hope this show never goes off the air. The show will become a classic in the same caliber as Lucy!
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|Love the movie love it love it want to see again for freee best movie ever ever gratisss por favor
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|My son has asked for these since before them came out!  He will be surprised that I found them at such a great deal!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Was able to send a you tube from laptop normally one time. After that 2 laptops unable to connect via Chromecast app. When I click you tube from the app it keeps searching for Chromecasts  I need to open you tube in separate browser window and send from there.<br />2 Androids send you tubes with some difficulty via app.<br />I wanted to stream home videos from laptop to TV but that is not doable.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son has wanted these since before they came out!  Glad I found at a great price and this will be a great Christmas present!
B00FDSUJ0A|5.0|This band sure is a rollercoaster ride! Too Weird to Live Too Rare to Die is definitely a new sound for P!ATD but then again which album of theirs sounds exactly like the previous one? Now, sure, this album doesn't have a whole lot of the usually intricate lyrics that leave you pondering their true meaning for days, but nonetheless the lyrics are interesting and some of them have what seems like a deep meaning behind them. I've been a fan of this band from the very beginning and they have yet to let me down.<br />Besides, Brendon Urie has such control over his voice now that he could be singing twinkle twinkle little star and it would still sound amazing. I would certainly recommend this album.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Love all the story's and the facts and mixed into it a few family things makes for a great show
B00C32R64G|3.0|Overall a good CD, but not their best in my opinion. I would just buy the couple of good songs and not the full album.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|The book was marred by a lot of errors, like switched characters names, typos, etc., but otherwise was excellent! Now I'm going to buy some canned food and do some emergency backups!
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|I do like this series of games and this is fun - but I still like the Rio version best. This is a great app for kids. Good for keeping them occupied on long trips or in waiting rooms.
B0001IMCDE|1.0|My wife and I searched for a year to find this movie and were so excited to find it on our favorite site amazon.com when it arrived it displayed disc could not be played in this zone I received a disc that was guaranteed by amazon to play well it doesn't play at all :(
B002QNTNL6|4.0|The movie is great, but I got about 5 'Content Errors' along it, and everytime had to fast forward because the movie was reset to the beginning. I'm not quite sure what causes those errors.
B009Y7YC2M|5.0|This is a surprisingly excellent application, with very high audio quality and a useful interface. I have installed it on my Kindlefire HD and used it to record my own dictations (to be transcribed by Dragon NaturallySpeaking) and conversations with others.
B00846REIS|5.0|10 times better than 50 shades! I can't wait for the 4th book to come out. You won't be able to put it down I read all 3 in 3 days
0316228583|2.0|Didn't expect it to be anything like Harry Potter, and it wasn't. But I did expect JKRowling to be able to tell us another fascinating story, and she didn't.  This story was boring.  The cast of way too many charactors was hard to care about. Plodding through the book, knowing \\"something\\" would eventually happen wasn't enough. The deaths at the end were predictable.
B007WDPPK8|5.0|I have been knitting for 45 years and consider myself pretty self-sufficient but OMG this book is amazing, I learned so much and am so excited to try many knew things I found in this book. Mostly I bought the book to translate flat patterns into circular knitting and the book does that and oh so much more. I must own 30 gorgeous knitting books and this one has rocketed up to number 1. You need this book, you really do....
1607744104|5.0|Very nice book.  The book is quite informative and a great help in description and care of plants.  Describes care and environment for many carnivorous plants.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Once I finish an episode, I can't wait to watch the next. If you like Damages, Brothers & Sisters, or Suits, you'll like this show.
1847879071|5.0|Seems I was one of the last to discover this gem.  The book is VERY user friendly and appears to be getting everyone's dissertation statistics done.  A great resource and worth every penny.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|My husband uses this more that I do, but says he loves it.<br />My husband is on facebook every night.  Sometimes he likes to use my Kindle instead of the regular computer so he can sit with me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fast read, good book.  Enjoying the series and this is the best so far.  Easy, fun read that I enjoyed.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Very easy to use.  I love it!!!!<br />Thank You for e-mailing me the suggestion.  Very easy to activate. User friendly.
B002U3CCBK|5.0|I enjoyed the reality of how the characters reacted to the problems faced and the political differences of the countries.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This app is really fun and is something to just waste some time with. Some of the quests and ponies require a lot of bits, but other than that it's great!!!!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This author never fails.  For a man to have the ability to put on paper these feelings of love and friendship in all of his books makes for wonderful reading.  To be able to lose youself in his stories makes you wonder if he or someone he knows has lived any of these experiences.  I don't know of anyone that would read his books that would not fall in love with his ability to express himself in this way.  His wife and family are blessed to have such a creative person in their lives.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|love the puzzles and the story line. needs to be more clear that you can try to save Jim at the end
B0096BIENY|5.0|Excellent selection of songs.  Listened to both CD's straight through, twice, on a long car trip.  So glad I bought it.
B005R32L66|1.0|This app is awful with my dtrs tablet. It wont load and when it finally does, it automatically kicks you out of the app and shuts it down. You cant ever use it.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Interesting read once you get into it. A little trite in some character development.Thought provoking epilogue-great book club choice for discussion!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I was told by others that this was just another zombie flick and it was no big deal.  I watched it and thought it was way beyond just &#34;another&#34; zombie flick. I would say its an original zombie flick.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Matthew McConaughey did a good job, and the movie was pretty true to the book. It was easy to follow; you didn't have to have read the book to follow what was happening.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|I like these types of games and this one didn't disappoint. Completed the easy level in an afternoon and looking forward to playing it again on the harder levels!  Worth the $0.99 I paid!
B0083Z614S|5.0|Simple good story of innocence and hope. Good story line and good characters with good development. Good read for all ages
0380725398|5.0|Yes, JAMAICA INN is a genuine thriller. Like Gary Cooper in HIGH NOON, JAMAICA INN's 23-year old Mary Yellan bravely faces danger with no visible means of defense other than her own character and wits. That is typical thriller.<br /><br />Yes, JAMAICA INN is a whodunnit in the sense that Mary Yellan suspects that her evil, alcoholic Uncle Joss Merlyn is not capable of running a hundred-plus smugglers, cutthroats and ship \\"breakers,\\" organizing distribution of loot, planning the timing and acts of bringing sailing ships to their ruin on the rocks of the Cornwall coast. So who is the mastermind? The squire whom Joss Merlyn tricked (through the behind the scenesmastermind?) into selling him JAMAICA INN? Is it Reverend Vicar Francis Davey, gaunt, scary-looking albino but about the only person who seems kind to Mary for Mary's sake, not his own? Or could the unseen wizard of evil be Uncle Joss's much younger brother Jem, even though Mary is falling for Jem?<br /><br />Yes, JAMAICA INN is a serious psychological probing of what brings men and women choose the wrong mates. Apparently whatever force drives the human race to reproduce itself does not empower otherwise canny women to resist being attracted to messy, unwashed, badly shaven, sometimes abusive males. It just happens, Mary ruminates, and there is nothing women can do about it.<br /><br />Yes JAMAICA INN also memorably describes Cornwall in its many moods: brooding, dangerous upland moors, treacherous rock-strewn coasts, rains, gales, terrible paths and backroads.<br /><br />And there are some weaknesses in this yarn:<br /><br />-- (1) The cover picture on Avon Books paperbacks makes you think that JAMAICA INN is perched on a cliff above the sea; in fact it is miles inland and may not even afford a direct view of the Cornish coastline and beyond.<br /><br />-- (2) There is no map. There should be. Eleven miles here. Thirteen miles there. If you are not British, you haven't a clue as to the lay of the environs of this run-down inn, a nest for smugglers and storehouse of their stolen goods.<br /><br />-- (3) The conversational language among the Cornish characters smacks more of London drawing rooms than Cornish moors. There are limits in author Daphne du Maurier's ability to empathize a path into the mores and minds of \\"little folk\\" characters.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there is one more strikingly good aspect to JAMAICA INN. The unnamed narrator is not God nor omniscient. Readers are located either within the body or brain of the heroine Mary Yellan or hover a few feet away. Nothing is told that Mary is not experiencing or remembering or being told by others. It is like a good history of the American Civil War in which, say, Stonewall Jackson doesn't know what is happening on the other side of the mountain just because the historian does.<br /><br />Also, like author du Maurier, heroine Mary Yellan is mannish. She often wishes she had been born masculine. She and her widowed mother had for years done men's work on their little farm. At Jamaica Inn, though terrified of six foot ten inch Uncle Josh, she boldly faces him down and says that she will bring the law down on him if he seriously hurts Aunt Patience. Josh backs down in admiration. Her boy friend (of sorts) Jem Merlyn is at times exasperated that Mary deliberately takes risks that no normal woman would dream of. At times Mary Yellan imagines herself returning to her home village and farming like a man.<br /><br />An easy first read. A more and more rewarding read from then onwards.<br /><br />-OOO-
0785165975|4.0|Not a bad read.  Mindy is kind of one dimensional in this entry in the Kick Ass saga.  Lots of blood and guts.  Red Mist steals the show in this book, as he is such a joke.  However, he has the ultimate superpower.  Money.
B00BMR4RIG|2.0|Much better apps out there with more real weather information; seems to be sold to promote their other apps. Really simplistic
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read this book like it was my job!! First, if you never read the Shining do that first. Having grown up with an alcoholic father who was very involved in AA I was amazed at what a great job Stephen King did with that part of the book.  It was also extremely scary & suspenseful. Finding out about Dan Torrence was so much fun. Can't say enough.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|If you've ever had difficulty in seeing software development as similar to manufacturing, this book will help spell it out for you. The characters and environment are faithful to the typical workday of almost of anyone in this business. Riveting.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a pretty good app. Got to admit that I thought it challenging.<br />STILL IT IS A AWSOME APP GET IT!!!
1444737112|5.0|I sent these as a gift to my grandson.  He is enjoying reading the book and loves the way they changed each other's lives.
B00E8S2JZ4|3.0|I love LOTR. I liked The Hobbit. However, 2 Hours 50 Minutes was long enough. I didn't watch it in the theaters because it was so long. I need a pause button and to be able to go pee mid way through. Not to mention get up and walk around.<br /><br />NOW they are releasing the extended version so it's 3 Hours and 3 Minutes long. An additional 13 minutes. I can't imagine attempting to sit through a movie in a theater this long without an intermission.<br /><br />I'll still buy this because I want to see the additional footage.
1444777564|5.0|My grandson is enjoying reading the moving story of bonding between man and cat. it is an entertaining story for all..
B0086WQNZ0|5.0|This is a valuable collection of Gould. The videos are really good. If you are serious about Bach, recommend buy it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I have enjoyed this game more than any other hidden object game.  It rocks!!  I really like all the different rooms and quests.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|So intense I didn't want to put it down,  I can't wait to read the next book. I recommend this book to all.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was incredible. I haven't found a book I have been so excited to find the time to read. It was interesting every single step of the way from page one. First time a book actually made me cry and so many other feelings I didn't think a book could give me. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anybody reading this review. I'm so excited to start the next book in this series!! Way to go on making this an amazing experience full of all emotion. Thank you!!!!!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Enjoyed the story line and liked the way the author kept bringing in new obstacles to the plot's story line.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the first reveiw i wrote but i thought the book was great. I loved it and to me there was no reason not to. Great book, good price.<br />Overall great deal
B0036S4B6M|5.0|What an insightful book! Everyone should read this book. If you are a law abiding citizen, you will be glad you chose that path. If not, this book might get you back on the straight and narrow. No wonder there are so many repeat offenders. In no way are prisoners prepared to reenter society! It is shameful and should be  an embarrassment  to our country!
B00FN811SY|5.0|Thank you very much for this wonderful gift! It's priceless! I will cherish it and I appreciate the hard work done on this.
B009YQJ322|2.0|Visually \\"Dredd\\" is very reminiscent of \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"Road Warrior\\", and \\"Robocop\\".  I'd say this is a case of style over substance but I didn't detect any discernible style.  The art direction and effects are alright but the makers of this film didn't invest in a decent script.  The characters are of the cardboard variety and the plot is mundane.  I felt like I was playing a video game without being an active participant.
B003JBI2KM|5.0|great book, a lot of good advise. this is extra words because Amazon want 13 words so here goes till I get there
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Too many films depend on special effects alone to drive their film.  It's that rare bird, Martin Scorsese's \\"Hugo\\" comes to mind, where the effects are there to enhance the story.  \\"Life of Pi\\" joins that select company.  What director Ang Lee has devised here is nothing short of a miracle.  You will find yourself transfixed by this tale of young Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) cast adrift in the ocean after the freighter carrying he, his family, and a menagerie of zoo animals capsizes. This film is a testament to will, determination, and faith that keeps Pi alive to survive his ordeal.  Much has been said about Ang Lee's direction and there's no diminishing that but I felt that Sharma to be the driving force of the film.  This is a case of a director and an actor working in communion to make something of lasting impact.  There are no adjectives that can sufficiently describe what a wonder this film is.
0545615402|5.0|The Books arrived in perfect condition, on time. They are smaller than i thought, but that is not a problem for me at all. I totally recommend this product.
B00ECLU346|2.0|not satisfied with this part. 1st part was very nice. than the later parts were not able to fulfill the viewers expectations.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I couldn't wait for this book to come out and I wasn't disappointed. I couldn't stop thinking about Monsters Inc while I was reading it though. I loved how different from The Shining it was but, there is no debating the two books go together. In my opinion they make each other better. Books like this are the reason I love fiction.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|A must read. Game changer. Changing our world, our health and hopefully our grocery stores. Gluten is the tabacco of our generationa!
B005CRQ3H0|3.0|Inherent Vice does good job of keeping you reading. However, there are many things about this book that make you want to bail along the way. The names can be tiresome, the plot strolls from place to place like a lost mall walker, and the build up sometimes leads nowhere. I want to like Pynchon but, sometimes I have trouble getting past the workout.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|What a great movie would really appreciate more of the same. Fantasy like this is too far between.  Seems everyone concentrates on gore, like in horror, blood and guts, about as far away from true fantasy and sci-fi as you can get.  I for one do not watch these that  further the lack of Gods love and faithfulness. Which makes this excellent movie a real treat, and gives hope for future change.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|The only problem was that the movie was interrupted 5 times due to perhaps server problems. Otherwise the picture quality was very good.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Wasn't expecting that ending. Author said it was inspired by Twin Peaks???? This book is way better than the show.
B00FFRAKRG|5.0|From a dubstep/numetal album to a more traditional style, Korn fans new and old are going to love this. Johnathan Davis lends epic vocals, while the band provides addicting riffs, and hard hitting drum lines. A must own for any Korn fan. :)
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Movie was good, great job in completing the storyline.  Great to see another special segment after/during the credits.  Looks like it's about the Hulk/Avengers 2...?
0385528752|5.0|I purchased Switch for a college course.  Although skeptical, the book has great value.  Exceptional read for all looking to, or already involved, in organizational leadership
B00AECGQF2|5.0|both my daughters love to play this silly game. one is 2 the other is 11. i dont believe that it has ever crashed on them either so I gave it 5 stars.
1936608898|5.0|If you want to know why you bloat, feel like crap, and never have enough energy, READ THIS BOOK. It opens your eyes on what is in the food you eat and why you should be changing your diet. It is a MUST read. I cannot say it enough. This book will change your life. After the Whole30, I was down 12 pounds and 4.5 inches in my hips. My BMI dropped 3 points! It was amazing. Highly Highly Recommend!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Every adult and child should read this book about kindness! It is easy to read and teaches us all in a wonderful way.
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|OMG. My husband and I were later bloomers to the Dexter phenom. Holy cow what a great show. Really dig the Hannah character and as expected there is a great season ender. So sad that the show is over:) but really looking forward to watching season 8 when available on Prime.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|Great show. Wife loved it. Caught her up on entire season. Wish wasn't so short. Only 5 seasons but great show
B00EHMG358|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy reading all the Preston & Child Novels.  Every Book is a &#34;can't put down&#34; type of book.  Their writing style is easy reading while keeping you  on the edge of your seat.  They are all &#34;have to read the next chapter&#34; before I can put the books down.  Love these guys.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun,I always play this after school. I always play every location that's possible in this game.
1401323820|5.0|The book was as described. Anxious to start reading and getting more Richard Castle books. Great service. Would order again.
B000001EL3|5.0|Amazing how they remaster these CD's...the sound was so clear and much fuller than the ancient cassettes that I have stashed away. And I even have the album. But of course the sound is nothing compared to these CD's...the delivery was quick, and the packaging secure. I'm very pleased.
0140177396|4.0|If you have this as required reading like I did, this is the best price I found for a soft cover copy of the book.<br /><br />As for the book itself, it's very predictable. The language used in the book is rather &#34;rough&#34;, but it gives a rather honest depiction of the people in the story. It was a short easy read (only a day if you're an average reader). I didn't love the book, but it was a decent story.
B000001ELB|5.0|Everything was great with this order from the quick delivery, bubble wrapped and  bubble envelope, to the beautiful flawless case and great artwork. But what really impressed me was the sound quality of the CD. Being remastered, it sounded like KISS recorded this three weeks ago not three decades ago. Obviously I was a big KISS fan growing up and I had this ancient cassette tape that I still listened to for years. But I wished I had it to play on my CD player. Then it dawned on me to try to see about getting one that I could! Wow. It turned out great. And the clear and much better quality made a huge diff! I've also ordered Detroyer, another favorite. I'll probably get them all!
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|This movie still holds up and the quality of the streaming was EXCELLENT!! I am required to add seven more words

B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|I really wanted to like this book about a google+facebook+apple combination turning the world into a 1984ish totalitarian state, but the story was frankly not that interesting. Mae joins the Circle as a customer experience representative and quickly gets immersed in the culture of the company. The culture involves measuring everything, getting ones \\"likes\\" up into the stratosphere, etc. The company and its culture turn employees into machines.<br /><br />Had this book been better written, and perhaps not so in your face about its message, it would have been a much better book. It has an important message about the transparency of social media, and the privacy we give up every day. It's enough to make me give up my facebook account. As it is, though, it made me think of the stilted dialogue in Atlas Shrugged where the message was more important to the author than how it was delivered.<br /><br />(Excuse me, but I have to go now and check to see how many likes I get on my facebook review of this book.)
B008XG1X18|5.0|A WONDERFUL WEBSITE FOR ANYONE INVOLVED IN ARTS AND CRAFTS AS YOU CAN OBTAIN SO MANY IDEAS FROM PINTEREST AND PUT YOUR OWN SPIN ON A PROJECT.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I tend to be rather skeptical of post-apocalyptic science fiction. It's a trendy genre that's overwhelmingly full of negative, unrealistic, cookie cutter quasi-copies of other stories that invariably require anti-depressants to finish. A quick look through the genre on Amazon shows a collection of works that come across much like South Park and killing Kenny; an exercise in how many ways the  human race can die and leave a few survivors to stew in the aftermath amongst a climate of tween angst. If you're lucky, a vampire shows up in the end as a deus ex-machina and resolves all the plot holes. As such, my skeptical nature led me to put Wool off for months before trying it out. I regret having done that.<br /><br />As it turns out, Wool is the exception to the rule. The book is set in a believable moderately hard-sci scenario with an inventive plot that twists and turns and takes you into unknown territory throughout the story. The characters are relatable and interesting and there is no shortage of suspense throughout. The plot taps into deep vibes of what authority is, why social rules exist, and ultimately what happens when people feel they've been had by those memes. And then you're left pondering what happens when those memes are tossed out and something new must be started.<br /><br />Wool is a well-crafted book that delivers a page turner of a story. While it's not exactly the rosiest scenario for the future of humanity, it does bear a glimmer of hope for the future and suggests that something better could be. I give it an honest five stars, as it delivers well on all counts. I can't wait to move onto Hugh Howey's other work.
B004ULNJIU|5.0|I JUST ADDED BLITZ TO MY COLLECTION OF JASON STATHAM'S MOVIES.  I THINK HE'S ONE OF THE GREATS WHEN IT COMES TO ACTION PACKED MOVIES.

B000LPQ6DE|2.0|Do not buy this 2-disc version of the 2006 Jane Eyre. It is missing large chucks of important scenes and could not be more deeply disappointing in that regard. As well, the brightness of it kept going dim, in and out, adding a further distraction. This outstanding version of the story deserves a better quality DVD than this.
1451620837|4.0|Wow, where do I begin?  'The Complainer' is actually a bigger loser than Ace Frehley.  The guy would quit the band over anything at all.  He accuses Gene and Paul for not having any class after he admits to beating his wife and shooting Christmas trees.  He would sabotage shows, he wouldn't play on the records.  Totally unprofessional.  He complains constantly about how hard it is to play in the World's Greatest Band...but somehow Eric Carr and Eric Singer pull(ed) it off night after night.  After a while you just wonder what planet Peter lives on if Ace is really from Jandel.  He's one of the luckiest guys ever and complains about $10k a show.  Gene and Paul don't hold a candle to Peter's worst enemy: himself.
B006PIXKVW|3.0|This movie had good reviews from critics, so I watched it, but found it pretty heavily geared toward kids.  Some children's movies are fine for adults, but I found this one to be someone tedious.

0385528787|5.0|I have always enjoyed Margaret Atwood's novels. The first one I read was &#34;The Handmaid'sTale&#34; which was a brilliant foray into dystopian vision.<br /><br />She did not disappoint me with this trilogy. The story flowed with beautiful detail and emotion.  I loved it as much as the first two books.  I am very sorry to say goodbye to all the characters

B004UJTG6Q|4.0|This is a great book with alot of significant themes.  Take your time reading it, as it's definitely worth it.
B005FRF6PC|4.0|Getting into Nadal's world is very interesting.  If you've followed tennis since his career began or before, this is a worthwhile read just to get a small understanding of how difficult it is to be a consistently great player.  The text does get bogged down with repetition about his family and his extremely sensitive demeanor, but it also serves to harp on what has made him unique in the tennis world.  Certainly one of my favorite players, this is well worth a read for any tennis fan.
0446310786|5.0|An all American classic that can win the hearts of readers of all ages.  As an adult it was a whole new experience reading it for the 2nd time.

I'm sure I still need to get the hang of it, but overall, it does exactly what I need it to do.  The control of it could be a little more user friendly though...
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Interesting plot line, but it felt scattered. Movie opens with a lot of exposition; seemed more like the start of a video game. Just tell me the story! Not the story behind the story... But a great flick for a Friday night.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I could not stop reading this book! Jobs life, vision and work have had a huge impact in this world.  If you want to be inspired and motivated to make a difference in your life and in the lives of others, read this book and see how one person gave his life to this vision and succeeded! Never stopping and always moving forward, even given life threatening setbacks, this man makes us think about what is really important to us and dare we be bold in making a difference? Are we willing to be and do what it takes day after day until the day we die!  Are we willing to look at what is important to bring into the world and be the one to stand for it?  I encourage any person that is up to something big in this world to read this book!  It is well written and it is one of the best and most important books to read in this century, if not ever!
0446699616|5.0|Since I read Plum Island (the first John Corey book) I fell in love with DeMille's writing and John Corey himself. This book certainly didn't disappoint! As always the book is filled with suspense, mystery, crime, and lovable characters (including Paul Brenner). I've learned to never trust the bad reviews written about DeMille's books. The Panther turned out to be another masterpiece!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|From master storyteller/novelist/scriptwriter Neil Gaiman: A simply-written and infinitely-readable story about good vs. evil, with human and other-worldly beings, special powers hidden in mundane things, and big things in small spaces... I couldn't put it down.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|One has the feeling that Mr. Gaiman can knock this stuff out easily, which is not an insult.  He writes effortlessly.  This is a young adult read, which has prompted me to purchase one of his adult books.
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|WoW!  Want a defining example of how Rachmaninoff should be played?  Look no further than this CD by Valentina Lisitsa.  I know of no living pianist that is as good at interpreting Rachmaninoff than Lisitsa.  I can't wait tp see what she does with other scores.
0670024813|4.0|Up until a few tens of thousands years ago all humans lived in bands consisting of up to a few dussin people. Thus during almost our entire evolutionary past we lived in an environment very different from the one we live in today. To understand the evolutionary pressures that have shaped our behavior and our cognition we need to look at the way our ancestors lived. This is of course more or less impossible because written history did not appear until very recently. However, there are people alive today, who live in a manner we think is very similar to the way all humans used to live. This book is about these peoples. How do they live and think, what are the similarities and differences between us and them? What can we learn from the way they live?<br /><br />This book shows that the life of our ancestors was not, as some people (especially Disney employees) like to think,  all romantic and in harmony with nature etc. Personally I would never switch my life in a civilized western nation for a life in the jungles of New Guinea, and I think that any informed person would be inclined to make the same choice. The life expectancy is about half of what I have now. They are also much more likely to be murdered because crime rates in such societies is extremely high compared to any state nation. Also they have no Wi-Fi, and that would suck too.<br /><br />In short, life was not better before, it is better now, much better. With that said, there are many lessons to learn from traditional societies and lifestyles. Jared Diamond in \\"The world until yesterday\\" goes through many aspects of life, including but not limited to health, crime, diet, child rearing and care for the elderly. Consistently, there are things that we do better in modern western societies and to his credit Diamond points this out. However, there are also lessons to be learned from people living in traditional societies.<br /><br />The justice system is good example. Crimes in traditional societies are dealt with by the community. There are no absolute laws. For example, murder is sometimes seen as justified and therefore not punished. If someone accidentally causes the death of another person then it may be sufficient for the perpetrator to pay sorrow money to the victims family. Western societies on the other hand see crimes as committed against the community and a perpetrator cannot walk away even if the victim forgives him (yes it is usually \\"hims\\"). What lessons can we derive from this. It is probably the case that we can learn things from traditional societies about finding common ground between perpetrator and victim. Grudges are usually resolved one way or another. However, in traditional societies it is also much more common that people take justice into their own hands, which can and do have fatal outcomes.<br /><br />In some areas the conclusion that progress have been made is inescapable. One perhaps unexpected example of this is wars. The first time I heard about the relative casualty rates in traditional and modern \\"total\\" wars I was rather surprised. I had always thought that the second world war was the worst war in the history of mankind, however, if one compares the casualty rate in the second world war with the casualties in wars between traditional tribes it is actually much higher in the latter. In some traditional wars the casualty rate reaches one percent of the population annually whereas Germany and Russia (the two worst hit nations) saw casualty rates of about 0.16 percent annually during the second world war. In other words, you would be much more likely to die in a \\"traditional war\\" than in WW2... One factor here is also the fact that whereas children in western societies are taught that killing is wrong and often feel bad after having killed another person (even in wars), children in traditional societies are sometimes taught to feel pride upon killing an enemy. Taking into account wars as well as violence that occurs between wars, it is crystal clear that we are much better off in our modern world. As Jeff Niehaus, who was teaching developmental psychology at UCSB once said, downtown Chicago is actually really peaceful if you compare it to traditional societies.<br /><br />I guess that it is clear to the reader that I feel quite fortunate that I live in a modern society and not in the jungles of New Guinea. In a few respects however the sometimes cannibalistic tribes outperform us. One obvious example is language. An average New Guinean knows five languages, which is rather impressive. I personally know only three and I think that is probably better than the average person in modern societies. Diamond argues that we should try and preserve languages which are otherwise bound to go extinct. I was not entirely convinced by his arguments. I accept that bilingualism is associated with performance on other types of tasks, delayed dementia etc, however, I also think that it would be desirable if communication between different peoples of the world was easier. Maybe there is a compromise between extinction of all languages except english (or chinese), and the ability of people to talk to each other (I'll have to return to that topic).<br /><br />In one of the last chapters Jared Diamond compares the health of people in modern and traditional societies, with mixed conclusions. Once again it is absolutely clear that we live longer in western societies. This ought to be problematic to explain for those who like to claim that a \\"natural\\" lifestyle is preferable and more healthy in general. Even though we are using more and more \\"chemicals\\" (everythings is chemicals really), we also live longer and longer. If chemicals kill us, then why do we live longer? In some respects our modern lifestyle is not so good however. We do consume too much salt and sugar. Diabetes is pretty much unheard of in some traditional societies, and high blood pressure (which occur if we eat too much salt), is also extremely uncommon. So one lesson we can learn is to eat less sugar and salt.<br /><br />There are many more interesting topics in this book. One that I found particularly interesting was child rearing practices where people in traditional societies spend much more time which their kids and have much more skin to skin contact, an approach I personally do believe in to a certain extent. I also liked the discussion about treatment of the elderly which ranges from leaving them to die when they go dement (this was the practice of Swedish natives), or killing them when they are no longer of any use, to chewing their food for them when they have no teeth (yuk).<br /><br />Overall I liked this book. It was 20 hours well spent although I think Diamond could have excluded certain parts that were personal and not so interesting if you are not extremely interested in Diamonds personal life. However, I did learn a lot that I did not know before and it gave me some new perspectives and it even made me want to change a few things in my own life. Above all however, the book reminded me of the privileged life I live. I live in peace. I have a family that I love (and I am under the impression that they like me too). I have a stimulating job that I like, and I am able to explore the world in a way that would be completely unimaginable to 99.99% of all humans that have existed on this planet. I really did win the lottery in the most important sense. Lucky me =)tal clear that we are much better off in our modern world.

B00E89VXQY|5.0|5 stars for the live version of Orion.  Literally been waiting 27 years for this.  I bought the CDs for this one song.<br /><br />Perfect song to close out the film and probably my favorite song in the Metallica catalog.  Live & Raw.  Perfection.  Thanks.
B000XXLY6I|2.0|What I recieved is clearly the boot ordered but just doesnt match what I was expecting. The leather feels nice and seems sturdy but the overall boot just feels cheap. There is no weight to these boots which some may like super light weight but for a pair of leather boots there needs to be more to it. The sole looks and feels really cheap and I would expect it to wear very quickly under normal conditions. On my foot they feel quite flimsy with a severe lack in support even laced up quite tight they still give under my weight (190 lbs). Ive owned and wore out several pair of Timberland boots so I know the company can produce really nice boots but these are just not them for me. The return process is a huge hassel and takes up a lot of time, really sucks!
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|there wasn't a single character that i gave a hoot about, the story line was confusing, and in the end simply stupid, and there was zero chemsitry between any of the actors.  Oh yeah, and it was boring.

But over the last fifteen or so years, the magic of &#34;It&#34;, &#34;The Shining&#34;, &#34;Pet Semetary&#34;, etc, just seemed to be gone.  I've been really disappointed in recent offerings. Not so with &#34;Dr. Sleep&#34;. This feels more like old school King than anything I've read in years, and boy, am I glad. But please, please, please.....can we have another???
B00BRUPICM|4.0|The first part of the book is very fast paced and it keeps you turning the pages. It ia a good book
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I like the way Ms. Rowell writes about relationships. She picks up on the little personality quirks and characteristics of each person in her books and it's like you know them personally. She left me wanting more of this story. Are there some holes in the storyline in places? Yes. But overall, I really liked it. I may actually do a re-read on this one, which, because I have so many books in my to-read pile, I rarely ever do.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|This is such a wonderful love story and the actors do such a great job portraying their characters , that you feel you are there with them.  Loved it.

B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I got this game as a free app of the day, but I would have easily bougt it. It's worth the money. The graphics are nice and the layout is very customizable. There are lots of tile sets and backgrounds to choose from. Overall,  I would recommend this game to anyone.

B00008LKDY|5.0|These recordings, issued in 2003, are very powerful conceptions of these works even though they are played on 'period' instruments. The twelve concertos recorded here follow on from the excellent opus 3 set of 12 concertos that Vivaldi wrote and lead the way towards his later opus 8 set of 12 concertos of which the first four are known as The Four Seasons.<br /><br />The orchestra is actually quite modest in size and consists of 7 violins plus Rachel Podger, 2 violas, 2 cellos, 1 bass and an assortment of continuo instruments, namely archlute, guitar, theorbe, harpsichord and organ (not all played at once!). There are thus just 13 regular player plus continuo, so about 15 at any one time. This is worth mentioning as the orchestra sounds considerably larger. This is partly the result of a generous acoustic and also because of the 'presence' of the recording relative to the instruments. The listener is placed near the front of the perceived listening venue.<br /><br />None of the above is in any way distracting as the internal balances are good. It is simply an adjustment that the listener has to make compared to other period groups which are regularly recorded on other labels.<br /><br />This particular group. Arte dei Suonatori, are clearly expert players and Rachel Podger makes an excellent soloist. The music is on a par as regards inspiration as the opus 3 and 8 sets previously mentioned although both of those sets probably contain more memorable elements which might explain their greater popularity. At the moment, competition for the opus 4 set recorded here does not really exist so this pair of discs have the field to themselves. This is a little surprising bearing in mind the quality of the music. However, any new versions will have to be very good to replace this set as the top choice.<br /><br />I would therefore suggest that, in a weak field, this fine recording is unassailable. Potential purchasers interested in exploring Vivaldi's opus 4 set can therefore be confident that this set is an obvious choice to consider at present and that the purchase is likely to remain recommendable for a considerable time to come.be confident that this set is an obvious choice to consider at present and that the purchase is likely to remain recommendable for a considerable time to come.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Very well done, I think.  Costuming, story line, historical record.  I enjoyed watching it and would recommend it to others.
B00ADIT8U2|3.0|Very good game I thought overall.  The only thing I disliked was the fact that levels 2 & 3 were in the same world (time).  There could have been a little more creativity put into that.  Also, I thought it could have been expanded a little bit with more exploration, as that is a big part of these types of games.  Definitely a good game, but not on the level of \\"The Secret of Grisly Manor\\" or \\"The Lost City.\\"
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|A must for any true Star Trek fan...a well told adventure with everything in the balance. Spock and Kirk stop fighting each other for a moment..and in that moment each realizes the other is their best friend instead of stubborn adversary.<br />A matching piece to the first installment. Recommended.
B00FFRAKRG|4.0|Seems decent, most of the tracks are not quite as catchy as other albums in the past, but overall I think it will grow on me the more i listen to it.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|A very interesting story from a very talented storyteller that brings language and culture of several generations together for fascinating tales.
0451232852|5.0|I have read it, I wanted to have a copy of it.  I may never read it again, but I want the whole trilogy on my shelves.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a very awesome game. I really enjoy the battles you have to face like: submarines, giant enemy crabs, and other evil sharks. This is the best hungry shark game I've played so far. I even like how there are goals, so you never get bored.

B007CGNOAI|3.0|Lack of coherent story but does provoke some thinking about what's important and how you are affecting the people around you.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Be prepared to become engrossed in the lives of Claire and Jamie Fraser!  You will want to read the entire series.
0399157565|1.0|This was Cornwell at her worst and I am a big fan of hers.  This book had to much of Scarpetta reminiscing  about the past. The thread of the story line was there barely.
B007RCJNDE|3.0|There is no doubt a lot of hard work with great imagination has gone into this final book.  But really; it was like reading report after report of commanding officers from World War One.  But I had to read it as I have read the whole series.  Don't get me wrong.  If you have read the &#34;Wheel of Time&#34; series you have to complete it by reading this one.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|One of the more creative movies I've seen this year.  Jay Z helped produce this and there is a lot of his music on here.  Great flick.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Great read and solid all the way through great potential as a series and can't wait for the next book
B005LJK3AC|4.0|Very entertaining movie with several funny lines.  It's easy to get involved in this movie and I'm sure some people can relate to having bosses like this.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|His book is so good. It's thrilling, adventurous, and extremely we'll written. I could not put it down and the ending was so well put together along with the the rest of the story. This is probably my favorite book I have eve read.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I really liked this book.  The story was very good.  it gave me more insight and understanding of the foster care system.  I was frustrated and upset occasionally by the subject of the book, but I could understand from her background where she was coming from.  The best part in my opinion was what I leaned about the meaning of flowers.  I would love to find a florist that would be able to send flowers to people with the knowledge that this book contained
B008P1EWIM|5.0|It's awesome when I'm stuck in the airport or need to see the weather quick so I can dress to be outside.
1476727651|5.0|I'll be spoiler-free for you folks who haven't read the book yet. Here's my opinion of the book, and maybe more so, my opinion of some of the reviews I've read:<br /><br />When a great classic rock band releases a new album, some 40 or 50 years into their career (think Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, etc.), it's often met with a critique which has grown far too predictable. \\"It's not like their first albums.\\",\\"They've sold out.\\",\\"They're not as inventive since they quit drinking/drugs/etc.\\"...take your pick. These responses and reviews really bug me for some reason - and most of the time they come with with very little to offer in terms of an honest analysis of the work. To me, expecting an artist (of any kind) to never evolve, grow, or try something new is insane...not to mention putting a rather boring expectation on a creative individual.<br /><br />Unfortunately, seasoned writers deal with this same issue; especially Stephen King. I've read several of the lower-rated reviews of Doctor Sleep, and was not surprised at all to see the same kind of hollow critiques. My advice: Ignore these.<br /><br />I, like many fans of King, was anxious to read this follow up to an all-time-favorite. I went back and re-read The Shining this summer in preparation for the sequel (which I recommend). Yes, you are dealing with a much different writer than the author of The Shining - that's to be expected (even King himself acknowledged this in his notes of the book!). Doctor Sleep has a different feel, different pace, and a different taste of horror than its predecessor - but it is STILL an impressive piece of work in its own right. Great story, some inventive twists, and just enough reflection to The Shining (pun intended) to give the reader that comforting sense of familiarity. I highly recommend it!<br /><br />As for those who insist that King has lost his edge after all these years and that Doctor Sleep left you with a bad taste in your mouth - I'd like you to consider that maybe it'snot just King that's been evolving...maybe your palette just isn't what it used to be.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really like this game but I have accidentally hit the bingo button during the game and it says it was a bad bingo. I wish it would give me a 2nd chance. I also don't like how hard it is to get power plays and keys. This game would be great with a lot of improvement

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is an exciting game to play for deer hunters all over the world. With these amazing graphics it brings real life right in your hands for a wonderful game play and action.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|The characters and action were fun but you could see the plot &#34;twists&#34; a mile away. Sadly all magician movies I see have to stack up against &#34;The Prestige&#34;. So if your movie queue is getting low this is fine as filler, otherwise watch &#34;The Prestige&#34; (hey, it has Michael Caine too!).
B001H1UQZU|5.0|Well done...love this movie.  Hilary Swank did an amazing job.  She deserves all the awards she received. Awesome true story.
B009AOFNU4|3.0|It doesn't really work with my MacOS 10.6 and earlier macs, but it works okay on more modern 10.7+ MacOS.  The SteelSeries software is EXTREMELY slow to respond, though, and I'm very unimpressed with it's configuration within that.  Extensible, yes, but the software is very cludgy and slow.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the convenience of being able to pick up my phone anywhere to read. It is much simpler than carrying around a larger e reader.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Daniel Craig who played the lead role had obtained a weapon of the aliens after being abducted that was a bracelet that opened up into a larger weapon and device that finds enemies. That evened out the odds between the cowboys and the advanced aliens. the story was pretty well developed and there were several battles between the humans and the aliens. There is also a somewhat strange effects and events which you would expect in an alien film. And it has a pretty good ending as well. Though the best action is in the last 40 minutes or so of the film when there is an all out battle. Very enjoyable.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a story that shows both the innocence and the wisdom of children. I love Burnett's writing style, which is neither too flowery nor too spare. She is excellent at characterization, and each of her characters glows with a distinct personality. Most of all I love this story because it shows the power we have to help others transform their lives, while we unknowingly are transforming our own. Although this is a children's story, I have read it regularly every year, and I am in my late fifties. The story of a lonely girl who begins to look at others and how she can help them instead of dwelling on her own problems and insecurities always inspires me and leaves me refreshed, which is why I love the book so much. I would not recommend this book to those who prefer action, adventure, suspense, or mystery. This is a story for readers who like to read about children, real life, and people who learn to deal with its problems.
0452273331|5.0|Once again, Ms Rand has hit paydirt with a book that was decades before its time.  Add this book along with Atlas Shrugged and one can see how Ms Rand had foreseen the future of this country.  A must read for all high schoolers interested in keeping this country on the right track.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Similar to 50 Shades, but better written. Easy read. Fun to get caught up in Eva's fantasy life and relationship.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this trilogy;  hate, hate, hate that I've finished these totally engrossing books.  The characters reach out and grab you so much so that you can't wait to see what happens to them next.  I am a mother of 2 daughters, so I wouldn't recommend these books to anyone under the age of 30!  LOL.  The sex scenes are moderately explicit;  I'll give them a \\"mature audience only\\" rating.  I was told by a friend that \\"they're (sex scenes) like Cinemax After Dark.\\"  I would have to agree.  These scenes get old by the third book and are soft porn material.  Don't let this deter you from reading one of the best modern love stories written.  I have been anxious, happy, moved to tears, laughed, and gotten mad all while reading this amazing story.  If you love dynamic character development, these books are for you.  I was so sad to see the end of book 3.  I feel a if I'm leaving friends behind.  These books will stay with me for a long time;  they've even changed the way I treat my husband:  with more love and respect.  Don't give up after the first book;  it mainly deals with the development of characters.  The second book will leave you hanging and wanting more.  The third book will answer your prayers for Anastasia and Christian....<br /><br />Happy reading!! Laters, baby!!!
B007ZXK08C|1.0|I realize, that this book is waste of my time after 1/4 of this book. In this book is nothing, what can I catch it and read to the end. I don<br /> not understand, that this book is the bestseller.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Post-apocalyptic story of a society living in a huge underground shelter known as a &#34;silo&#34; due to the uninhabitable conditions of the outside world.  Lots of satisfying twists and turns, all told in a highly-readable narrative.  Great characters, thoroughly enjoyable story.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love the story line and the graphics. If you like great hidden object and puzzle games this is for you.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|A very atmospheric, freaky, chilling movie with a disturbing plot.  Spoiler Alert: A demon that possesses children, makes them kill their families in gruesome ways, and then disappear.  A true crime writer that stumbles upon this plot while researching the hanging killing of an entire family (minus one, of course).  Well acted, creepy, and a great movie for the Halloween season.  Better, in my estimation, than &#34;Insidious&#34; or most of the &#34;found footage&#34; genre.  Dont plan on sleeping well that night.........
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My daughters are used to the Disney Princesses, wanted something different but not scary....this is perfect.  It's original and very funny. I think I like this more than my daughters, lol. I just wish it wasn't Adam Sandler though.
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|Hysterical, always a great cast! They have such great rapport with each other! Great finale a good way to end the saga
B00CKKDZ2S|3.0|Its limited. Without purchasing the full version, it will only tell you the past and present. I understand but I already know those.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|spend hours to play  and never get bored. great time killing  game. have fun out there and enjoy the fun
B0090RSYVG|5.0|I love my Lego Loki! Great design and hasn't fallen off. Great product, completely satisfied! Would buy another and recommend to a friend.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Another Self Portrait is great...  Can't say the same for the original Self Portrait...<br /><br />What Marcus' liner notes won't tell you, past and present, is that Self Portrait is one of the most bizarre Protest albums of all time...  (Not another protest album!)...  But this time it's protesting upper management, or, in this case, sideways management - Albert Grossman - he of the Alberta #1,2,&3... - who 'set up' Dylan to create a publishing company in 1966 that entitled Grossman to a 50/50 split on Dylan's post-1965 song publishing; apparently Grossman didn't explain to Bob that they would be partners!... haha...  So Grossman would be getting 50 percent of Dylan's publishing revenue on top of his 20 percent managerial fee...  Dylan finally got wise to the reality of the arrangement around the time of Self Portrait and wanted Alberta to not get as much gold as his apron could hold, at least not through Dylan's songwriting sweat - thus, Self Portrait... - which could easily have been called Self Protest - i.e.., let me read that document again or for the first time, Alberta...  Seen in this light, Self Portrait is an hilarious mockery of making a farce out of the publishing situation Dylan was in at the time...  But it still doesn't make that album eminently listenable...<br /><br />I bought the Deluxe Edition with the Isle of Wight concert CD - well worth it if you can spare the coin...
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great value for money, lots of info a lot of different locations. Because it is free I can live with the ads
B009LDCXNY|3.0|It was great to finally get this season as I have all the current ones and there was no where in the UK I could locate it, So it was a long wait but one well worth it. The product was in new condition and being I have a DVD player which plays multiple regions, I was able to watch. I did have one mishap which cost an additional £14 approx. on postal costs. Which I then had to pay upon collection, which I did not expect.
0439882826|5.0|great gift, anyone from 8 years old and up will love getting this as a gift.  Good coffee table book
B008602KQI|5.0|If you loved the books you would definitely love this movie. I have prime shipping so it was &#34;no brainer&#34; to try see the movie on my iPad. Jennifer Lawrence is great young actress. Acting in the movie was very good from the other characters, too. Now my looking forward to the next movie.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I thought this book really captured the outline of ancient Greek and I found it absolutely positively drive like Greece itself.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Fun game, not too difficult. Works just fine on both my kindles, no problems. If you are a match 3 fan you will enjoy this game.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was an awesome continuation and I hope that Hollywood follows suit and makes this a movie as well!  Well written, and loved the surprise ending
B00EHAIHWM|4.0|Love the new album, title track is great.  If you like their other albums you'll like this one as well.  Don't buy this version though buy the deluxe edition instead with additional live tracks.
B001BANK32|5.0|Love, love, love Stephen King.  I read this a long time ago, but w/ Sleep Dr. coming out I thought I would re-read it and it was just a good as the first time!
B00EHF41QS|4.0|Great album, love the new songs.  The live tracks are good as well but could be a little bit more lively, no crowd noises or anything so the tracks were probably captured at the PA.  I bought the regular version at first, but I really wanted the live tracks.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Ive only had this game for like 5 min and it is already amazing. Id recommend this if your a call of duty fan.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun, and very addictive. Love it!<br />Everyone should get it and try to beat my score!<br />Really Far!
B005J6LKVI|4.0|My mom loved the movie - I watched it recently when I went over to her house and it was ok. But if it made her happy, and made a great gift, I'm happy with the purchase!
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|My wife's been a fan of Lorde for quite some time and she got me into it before it was popular. We were waiting for this album. I've repeatedly zoned out to it while on the fitness machine at the health club.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Not much to say, although I do think some of them are extremely hard and some are super easy. A good time-waster, you can afford to download this app.
B00EYE0ECW|1.0|The map takes forever to load. Then it's only half the screen; the other half is taken up by Google's search and ad space. It's just easier to use my Droid smart phone to search Google Maps. I deleted the app from my Kindle within 15  minutes of downloading it. Sorry, Amazon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's really fun and creative I really like it yay my horse oh and by the way I'm 9 years old
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Simple, but fun, and that is the beaty of a superb game. Just bought the HD version, so let see if continous the same.
0312945973|5.0|The best novel set in Ancient Egypt. Period. Nothing comes even remotely close. Don't even bother looking at the others just go straight to this!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I really am enjoying the series, wish I had hours to just sit and read! Can't wait for the others to come out.
B005DNO7MQ|4.0|i love this movie ... what more can I say? It's not exactly historically accurate but still a great movie
B009EP3DJM|5.0|I'm so glad I gave Kesha a chance.  I really had the wrong impression of her.  I like most of the songs on this album and that is pretty rare for me.  Stand outs for me are \\"Thinking of You\\" \\"All that Matters\\" \\"Crazy Kids\\" \\"Die Young\\" and \\"Wherever You Are\\".  This album is a ton of fun.
B000GUJZ4G|3.0|Better than I remember it when it first came out. Absurd, but revelling in its absurdity, and with breathtaking action sequences, A good example of Bigelow's obsession with outsiders and outlaws seeking the ultimate thrill.
B0081336FO|5.0|Excellent series. Just as good if not better than the first. Would recommend to anyone that is a Sherlock fan
0740797719|5.0|This book is a jewel. I am learning a lot from it. You already learn a lot just by looking at the pieces of art inside. All the color and light knowledge I wish I had earlier is here :)
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Couldn't put it down.  Was a little disappointed at the twist (not sure it worked for me) am not going to buy the second book).
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Ostensibly an adolescent novel, but with so many layers and levels that it's really a brilliant novel for adults as well. Bravo!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good challenges, and a fun game to play.  Highly addicting.  Fun to challengers for friends.  A good game for all ages.  Have recommended this one to several friends and family members.  They love to beat me.
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|This book is a joy to read.  The chance to get inside the mind of the once young hero from THE SHINING is too good to miss and once we are there, we get to visit and experience an entire mini universe of like minded people with similar talents and  abilities. (&#34;if only it was true... If only it was true&#34;).  It is fascinating also to learn how young Danny Torrance turned out given the horrific experience we witnessed when he was just a five year old boy.<br /><br />Slowly but surely, Stephen King uses his vast story telling talents to wind us around his little finger, ready to scare the wits out of his (constant) readers like the magician that he is.  At once we find ourselves moved by the beauty of a piece of prose, and the next paragraph down, we find ourselves too scared to move, too scared to look away from the page, and yet we are loving every minute of it.  Just like a trip through the Horror House found in Joy Land, the town of Frazier is a nice place to visit but we would not want to live there.  Or would we?  I am pretty sure I would.<br /><br />So we get to know the grown up Danny Torrance, the little boy survivor of the hell that was the Overlook Hotel.  Approaching 30 years of age, he is an unofficial alcoholic who moves from town to town, and from job to job, drifting his way through life as he tries vainly to escape his past.  But our past is like a shadow and it is always there, no matter how hard you try to escape it.<br /><br />The flip side of all of the goodness presented so far by Mr King is the evil known as the &#34;True Knot&#34;.  They sound more like the &#34;True Knobs&#34; to me but they are not to be taken lightly.  A more dangerous and demented group of individuals have probably never before been created and set to life, and yet they have set their destiny and future on the capture and torture of young Abra Stone, the shining light of this book (no pun intended) who was always  destined to team up with Dan Torrance in a supernatural finale that was as perfectly plotted, drawn, worded and produced as anything that Mr King has ever written.<br /><br />Emotional attachments are formed of course to the main characters.  Readers of the THE SHINING are attached to Dan before the book is even opened and Mr Halloran makes a cameo appearance or two right throughout the book, even though somer readers may be disappointed that his role was not larger.  The bad guys are obvious right from the start and of course you hate them but not enough to want to jump into the book itself and rip their eyes out.  We shall have to leave that for young Miss Abra Stone and her ragtag team of heroes.<br /><br />So in summary, anyone who has read THE SHINING will want to read this book.  There is certainly not the same level of suspense in this volume as there was in book one but Mr King is not the same person he was back in 1975.  Heck, the world is not the same as it was a week ago.  So maybe the book is not about ghosts and haunted houses.  Maybe the real ghosts are what we find each time we look in the mirror, and the demons are what we see at the bottom of our empty glasses.al finale that was as perfectly plotted, drawn, worded and produced as anything that Mr King has ever written.<br /><br />Emotional attachments are formed of course to the main characters.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|I appreciated Piper's compassion and composure. In situations that were frustrating and seemed hopeless, she maintained her cool.<br />Piper took full responsibility for the poor choice she had made in smuggling the drug money, she did not try to lay the blame on someone else.<br />Rather than being judgemental and feeling superior, Piper sought to understand the inmates. She had an awareness of what might have landed the inmates in prison and also an awareness of what they might be facing when they were released. She had an appreciation for what she could learn from this experience.
055357342X|5.0|Another entry in the saga.  If you liked books 1 & 2 at all, you will love this one!  It contains many shocking plot twists; I did not see many of them coming.  Don't start this book unless you have set aside some definite time for it.  I did not want to put it down.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|At first, I thought that this was a rip off. But once you figure out how to use it<br />It's a-w-s-o-m-e. I mean, come on you can change your stuff in your inventory<br />Get budder crap and all that stuff (and you can also get stuff you don't originally have like, camera's,slime balls,and glitchey blocks,and dead shrubs,and more.<br />Get it, you be happy with it (that's if you know how to use it.) But you'll get used to it. &copy;2003-2013 samdoesminecraft co.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I love this movie and the video streaming is awesome. And the prize is very good. I will be purchasing more movies
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very exciting book. Kept me on my toes the whole time. I couldn't put it down and I hate to read.
B00E9O6C96|5.0|This is by far the best sounding player I've ever owned. I don't own any mp3 but I have a great deal of 16/44, 24/96 and 24/192 flac music and the sound thru headphones, plugged into my car or plugged into my home stereo is outstanding.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Amazing watch and an incredible deal. I bought this watch at what I thought was a reasonable price, but once I received it I realized it was so much more. Good weight to it, solid, keeps great time and fit and finish is perfect. It is an automatic winding watch, so remember that. It took me 1.5 days of wearing it for it to keep time overnight, but I've had no issues since then and it keeps perfect time.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had been hearing about Downton for a couple of years, but just had to opportunity to get &#34;caught up&#34; what a wonderful, wonderful show!
B00FN811SY|5.0|Acurrate to the original meaning of ancient writings without any doctrinal prejudices. The cross references to other translations is a big plus.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Awe Inspiring, captivating, motivating, educational, promising and loving most of the speakers. I get to get out of my world!!
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Very funny but if you don't clear a level the game repeats too much.<br />Maybe if you don't clear a level, the re- do should have one new game to surprise you.
B001DF68MA|5.0|... when they see our toddler in it. She loves it. The straps are so-so, but your arms on the sides act as extra protection so it works out. We don't have a tall kid and her feet still tend to remain slightly outside where they should be placed. It's easy to take the whole thing off because it's just 1 bolt that holds the whole thing to the support bar. I'm not sure if 1 bolt is a good thing, but on the flip side if you need to toss your bike on to a hitch/carrier, then it's easy to take this thing off quickly.
B0025YKDJC|5.0|I had seen this movie when it first came out. Found it on here for a great price (especially being Blu ray) I was very happy with the shipping time as well. Great Product, great price, and great shipping times!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is tremendois . it teaches you all about horese needes and cares. your kid can also know how much responsibility it takes to have a horse.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Great mouse for the money.  Easy to set up and use.  Good (not great) ergonomics.  Just wish it weighed a little more.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|One of my favorite movies!<br />I have searched high and low for this movie and now it is mine.<br />It arrived brand new with additional footage and music video
B00EDN07RG|3.0|I would have loved the pitch perfect items if they matched with the movie better and especially didn't like the broken cup
B006GLMHBM|3.0|It was okay!<br />I wouldn't watch anymore even though I thought it was nice to see how it began.<br />Mr. Big......
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love the entire series. Couldn't put them down!!! Gideon and Eva will capture your hearts!! Looking forward to the next 2 books!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|cute little puzzle game ... i would recommend  it to anyone ... a little bit frustrating  at times but still worth a try
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good graphics,fun game to play. Like the fact that this is more then just a search and find game, has different puzzles to solve
B005MYEPXC|5.0|After seeing the movie at a friends home, I had to add it to my collection. I loved the music and punched the sound track on iTunes. This is a feel-good movie that the whole family can enjoy. It makes you feel as though you are in Paris and having a wonderful time returning to the 1920's. A great job by Woody Allen, this is one of those movies that has not received the attention it deserves.
0743571975|1.0|The audio skips in certain places.  The content is not the problem .The sound is like that of a vinyl record that is scratched at a particular place.  This Makes it difficult to discern what the narrator is saying at certain points.  This was not a good recording.
B001BANK32|5.0|Woah...this book was scary! Not that I'm probably telling anybody anything they don't know, but I just feel like I can't say it enough. I read it in October because I wanted a good scare for Halloween, and that is exactly what I got, and boy, was it fantastic?!<br /><br />I have just 2 complaints, the 1st of which being that at one point in the book, Danny knows the word \\"abrogated\\" (which means repeal or do away with...I had to look it up), but he calls the Presidential Suite, the Presidential \\"Sweet\\". Now, I know his parents never \\"talked down\\" to him, but I still wonder how he would know how to use abrogated. But in the overall excellence of the book, I really feel this is more of a minor point than a major one.<br /><br />The second of which being that the parts in parentheses were somewhat distracting. And apparently the Kindle edition was not converted as well as it should have been, because parts that were supposed to be in quotations inside parentheses were not...instead they were surrounded by question marks or exclamation points. And because of the parts in parentheses in general, I often found myself going back to the original sentence to catch up with what it should be saying.<br /><br />For the scariness factor, I really expected the book to be a nonstop scare-fest. Which, of course, it wasn't. Up until somewhere probably around 70% or so, there were just little pockets of terror...which I realize were just preparing me for the scare-fest to come. And it was glorious! Once it started, I simply could not stop reading...I was like a woman possessed. I HAD to know what was going to happen. It felt like the fate of the characters depended on my continuing to read.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this book!! I loved Danny's character...he was very interesting, and quite an amazing little boy. But still vulnerable at times, which I think is important. And I liked Wendy, too, though I think she should have just divorced Jack outright. But then we wouldn't have hada story, either. I thought Jack was terrible. And maybe that's unfair, all things considered, but I just couldn't bring myself to like him.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good scare. It provides a great story and a great scare all in one package.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Great entertaining show. The character cast is easy to love and the epidoses are fun to watch. Love the witty sense of humor. Well written. Each episode has an ending (ie doesn't drag on and have cliffhangers for each episode)
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love the game and play every day.  Met some very nice friends in the rooms. Some of these people were my friends from other games that I have played.  Great being acquainted with them again.
1451695195|5.0|Great testimonial from a scientific side. Nice testimonial on his experience if life after death. I would recommend this book!!
B00F8802SE|5.0|ONE OF MY TOP 5 SHOWS!!<br /><br />Am new to getting it on Instant download.. Wish I knew what the total price will be.. or even an estimate.. any ideas??
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Once I actually found that these books had a story and a love story at that, I really enjoyed it.
B00DW2PDH8|3.0|This book had me more than once scratching my head. Are these the ramblings of a madman? Or is this very cleverly written to create the ramblings of a disturbed character?<br />It jumps from what I at first thought was one character to another and from scene to seemingly unconnected scene, but the second reading made it clear. So, although the way this book is written, chaotic and very confusing, makes it a difficult book to read, it still captivated me. I wanted to know what was going on, and most important how it all would end!<br />It isn't an easy, lounging on the sofa with a glass in hand book. This book requires a clear head and focussed mind, otherwise you will get lost in the maze of this story. Is that a good thing? I guess if you are into that sort of reading material it is. If you are looking for an easy read, just another vampire flick, I suggest you skip this one. But if you like your books to challenge you, this might just be a book you could grow to love.<br /><br />I received a review copy in exchange for an honest review.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|By book 3, I had become rather engaged with the characters with all the flaws they had. I had to admit that the writing was not the best, I did hate to have the stories come to an end.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This is a well written and acted movie. It examines patience as a virtue; planning, foresight, and attention to detail as traits of a true professional performer. The movie is well thought out in both plot, selection of actors, and their roles. Characters are believable and the tensions between them all seam plausible. It seems to me that \\"Now You See Me\\" could provide families with preteens some fertile ground for discussions. Even an old fart like me will enjoy this.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|At the outset of reading this, I was very hesitant to keep on, but realized that it really did have love story to it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's easy to use and a lot of fun. It is interesting for a wide range of ages and ability levels.
B0032O6S4I|5.0|The zoo is an excellent toy for my kids (1 year old and 9 years old) and they enjoyed playing it together.<br /><br />Item was received fast and well packaged.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|This case fits my kindle perfectly. The only change I would like is a Velcro fastener to hold it shut.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I freaking love this show. Such a cute and quirky comedy--it is one of the best of it's kind since Friends!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great characters and story. Science fiction writing like you've always wanted on film. You'll be wanting more after each episode
B00F91SCXC|4.0|It was a great movie, enough said! Watched on PS3 with Amazon movies, video and audio quality were very good!!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|An excellent story,albeit a little preposterous at times.Still a well-told saga.I look forward to the next installment with great interest.
B009RX7IX8|4.0|The writers make Castle's books come to life.  Te interplay of the actors and actresses make it believable.  We're a little put off by the bedroom scenes but, we're guessing the books are even worse.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Keeps you thinking, and great entertainment. Helps pass the time and keep your mind working. My kids even enjoy watching me play!
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|Finally 'get' what this play was about. This movie was made by Shakespeare lovers rather than Shakespeare actors and I don't disagree that Shakespeare actors would say the words better, but I feel this movie more.
B00F8LPH90|4.0|I've been waiting for this game to come out for Kindle fire and its finally here. I've been playing this for a few days now and I'm still addictive to it. The graphics is amazing it's like the apache videos that you see online but in zombies style. The game runs pretty well on my kindle fire HD and I haven't noticed any problems yet which is good. The sound is also fantastic especially the sound of the guns that your using.<br /><br />My Ratings<br /><br />Graphics 5/5 - Stunning graphics and effects even its in black and white.<br /><br />Control 4/5 - The controls is pretty easy to use, but switching weapons is kinda annoying.<br /><br />Sounds 5/5 - The voice actor and sound effects is pretty good specially the sound of all the weapons.<br /><br />Here's a few problems: (Note that problems that I mentioned doesn't effect game)<br /><br />On the top left of the main menu there's a loading sign that keeps going I don't if that part of the style or the loading is just pretty slow<br /><br />On the lower left of the main menu the objectives button won't open.<br /><br />The Ranking is not working either<br /><br />Here's what I'd like to see in the future:<br /><br />-More selection for weapons<br />-Missions<br />-More kind of Zombies<br />-More and bigger Maps<br />-Music<br /><br />And that's my review, I do recommend this game to everyone, it's really fun, highly addictive, pretty easy to control, and its only .99 cent.

1476734941|5.0|This diet not only works but makes me feel very clear headed with more energy overall. I've been on the diet for about 2 months, and have lost an average of 1-1.5 pounds per week (10 lbs total), and for 2 of the weeks I only did the diet 1 day out of the 2. I do the 500-calories on Mondays and Thursdays. I did try vigorous exercise (running 3-4 miles) on the diet days when I first started, but found this was way too excessive for me, so I have tuned down on exercise and am only doing moderate exercise (like walking, light yoga). Still, the weight is flying off ... Some background on my \\"diet history\\" -- I had my second baby 10 months ago and had plateaued at about 25 pounds over my \\"normal\\" weight for about 4 months, and as a result my cholesterol levels are slightly too high and my doctor has been urging me to los weight. I tried a ton of diets to get off the plateau (juice fasting, running, low carb, low cal, you name it). Nothing was working. This book resonated with me, especially the part about the astonishing health benefits that people are experiencing on fasting/reduced calories. The initial 2-3 weeks were difficult, but I found motivation in reading blogs and re-reading this book when I needed inspiration...they were difficult, but not too bad -- because I always knew I could pig out the next morning (which I rarely did, but just nice to know I could). After about 3 weeks, my body got used to the fasting days \\"rhythm\\" and it is actually something I look forward to, I feel it gives my body a \\"rest\\" and I still have plenty of energy. I On the non-diet days, I eat anything I want (really, anything). An interesting thing, at about the 5-6 week mark into the diet, my appetite went down naturally without any effort on my part...i'm just eating less because i'm far less hungry. I really do believe this is an Eating Strategy, not really a \\"diet\\"...it's perfect for me because I'm a Foodie and will never stop enjoying all types of food (and wine). This is the first time in my life that I have found a Strategy that I can and will do forever. As soon as the rest of the weight comes off, I will go down to 6:1 just to maintain. I found the best way to get through the diet days are I drink tons of black coffee (maybe 3-4 cups total) and have a hard boiled egg at the latest possible time I can (usually between 12 noon and 3pm), then I save most of my calories for a 420-calorie homemade stir fry of beef and loads of vegetables, with a lot of herbs and dash of thai red curry sauce. I cook with just 1 tsp of olive oil, and use a ceramic fry pan. This really fills me up. I'm looking forward to my next doctor check-up, I have a feeling my cholesterol will be completely normalized and my weight within very normal range.<br />UPDATE<br />So 2 1/2 months later, official doctor report shows my cholesterol is down by 44 points..all readings well within normal range.

The humor throughout the book is a breath of fresh air. The dilemmas that Poppy encounters connect to real life situations: losing her cell phone, meeting the crazy in-laws, and finding a friend when she least expected it. This book has it all: moments where you laugh out loud and others when you shudder with embarrassment. Kinsella did a good job bringing all the emotions together, and for that I applaud her.
1594202273|5.0|I enjoyed the author's other works, and this one didn't disappoint. Presenting a very entertaining, yet calmly terrifying picture of nuclear weapon safety issues over the last century, the author makes a very compelling case for reducing the nuclear stockpile and stepping back from the brink of a world-ending nuclear accident.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Have read all David Baldacci books and this one is just as good as all the others.  Be sure to read the Hit, which is the other book prior to this in the Will Robie series.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Dark but wonderfully written and developed. The characters, especially Dorian, take on multiple dimensions and draw the reader into the frailties of being human without a hammer.
1439102813|5.0|great insight on what Alzheimer's looks like from the person afflicted with  this condition, especially in early stages.  I recommended it every chance I get.
B0012X69JK|5.0|I'm only part way in, but Pinnock and the English Concert NAILED this performance--timing, pitch, balance, tone... all masterful.  This is the one to buy.
B005NACYQU|5.0|I loved this book. It is far out, imaginative, out of this world. I loved everything on-stage and behind the scenes. Anyone who likes the far out and fantastic will enjoy this too!
1936608898|5.0|Very informative and applicable to everyday living.  This makes good sense and it  is a lifestyle change that is doable.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Amazing depth, without being too drawn out. I can't wait to pick up the next installment. So many questions were answered yet there are so many new ones is baffling.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|this App works well with my Kindle Fire HD.  And it is free for Kindle users.  Can't beat that price
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Diana Gabaldon, in my opinion, is one of the best writers I have ever read,  This book is book 3 in her 7 book series.  It's best if you start with Outlander,which is her first book, and go on from there. She writes an ongoing story from one book to the next. In this book Claire comes back to her time1968, to have a baby. After 20 years she goes back to look for Jamie, her husband in 1766.  There are all kinds of plots going on at the same time.  For the best results you should read the books in order, mostly to keep up with the stories, She does remind you of what has happened in previous books, but does not dwell on it. Its mostly to let the new readers know who and what has happened previously. She does it quite well, just enough to let you  know what happened or to whom she is referring.  Claire goes hunting for the men of the Fraser Clan who fought in the '45 rising, which is what the battle of Culloden is called. Diana writes  a beautiful love story  between Claire and Jamie. It is not just sex, she writes about, but a great on going love between Claire and Jamie, that is a theme throughout all her books.  I would recommend all her books to anyone who loves reading and  is interested in books that they hate to end, because the books are so good. All but her 2nd book starts up where the previous book ends. Her books are very big, and I'm sure you will love them all,  Once you start reading her series, you keep looking for the next book to come out to see what will happen.  She has written many books with most of her characters in them, not just the series, but other books with spin off  characters from her books  in series of their own.  Her characters are so good and interesting that you keep looking for more books with them in the stories to see what happens to them.<br /><br />Germaine Rosenquist
B005544TRQ|5.0|a new twist and new faces; well written for all the people that want to read reviews on this site
B0071XO8RA|5.0|You should read the whole series in order. I loved them all! :)  If you like end of days books, these are for you.

B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Its a good show I like revenge its really interesting to know of having the power of what someone does
B008MVP964|5.0|I've worn crocs for several years, and they are very comfy, but the bottoms always wear out quickly and lose traction.  When I saw these heavy-duty soles I ordered them and they are great, and sure to last a lot longer!  However, in the smaller (men's) size there was only one color choice.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|This book--this series--is just great reading. Fun, exciting, funny, with a touch of fantasy and swashbuckle. Very likeable main characters.
B000IZ1HP4|5.0|Always liked this western. Depicts good and evil well.<br />The acting is the best. May watch it again in the future.<br />Roman Jarosz
B00BMR4RIG|3.0|Not bad, but not as good as I expected. There are others out there that will track more than one city and certainly there are more out there that are accurate within 5*.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Very well written, grabs your attention from the very beginning. Fortunately, there are 18 other titles in this series, which I plan to read all.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It's a great game.. It's great fun and great that you can connect it to your Facebook so you can compete with friend and share high scores..
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book was very interesting to read. I enjoyed reading about things from a different prospective. I am reading another book from this authur.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Great short story kept me riveted and guessing at different outcomes, always proving why I'm not the writer. Left me wanting more.
B004H4XDBI|3.0|When I finished the first book, I was satisfied. But me myself being a book nerd, I read many other books before I read this novel, but the whole time the thought , 'what will happen to Mia and adam?' wouldn't leave my mind. So I finally read the second novel to the series -this novel- and was completely, well, happy. It's a little frustrating at first, but by the end I was just blown away, a must read.
B002M2T1UO|4.0|This was a birthday gift for my son.  He said it was great and was very pleased with the series.  Service on Amazon has always been wonderful with no complaints.  Thanks for everything you do to make all our purchases easy and convenient.
B000AQJPQE|4.0|It is a great addition to my son's space themed room. Is is small and not as bright as it looks in the pictures and it is not hard wired in
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very nice and functional app.  I couldn't ask for more from a calculator.  It looks nice too!
B00BV1OT0O|3.0|I have never purchased a Funko POP item before and therefore am not aware of the overall quality of their products.  While extremely cute, the detail is terrible - particularly as far as the paint work goes.  Starting at the top - he has small spikes over his head painted black.  Unfortunately, the paint only goes about halfway down most of the spikes.  The very front center spike is partially painted and has a grey smear of paint down his forehead to his goggle.  The goggle itself is painted silver, but the upper right section is smeared with black paint.  His eye has a BRIGHT yellow crescent of paint at the bottom - not the yellow of his body, but a neon yellow.  The overall yellow color of his body is smudgy and uneven.  His blue overalls are streaky and the blue is smeared over onto the yellow body in some spots, and missing from some edges of the overalls.  The black of his gloves is smeared over onto the yellow of his arms.  There are dots of black paint all over his overalls, especially on the underside.<br /><br />Finally, this is a very small item - I thought it would be a bit bigger than it actually is, but it is about the size of a baseball.  This is less than $10 so I suppose you get what you pay for.  It is a neat little item for fans of the movies (which I am!) but don't expect a true \\"collectible\\" item.  I'm keeping him!
B0042J6VUS|3.0|The with is restricted. This is essentially for a iPhone or older Droids.<br />Somewhat misled by the description of, for iphones and other phones.
B00013VHI0|5.0|One of Anathema's greatest albums. The lyrics are very deep and the music is so touching.<br />If you like this one, you'll also like their albums &#34;Judgement&#34; and &#34;Weather Systems&#34;.
B00CQE8WCQ|1.0|I wish I could get my money back on this video. On both tv's we had to crank the sound up until it was vibrating and we still couldn't hear the dialog, only the music. Yes, we changed the settings, but no good. I'm sure the neighbors heard our video when we were playing. Totally and wholly sucks!
B007QPFGJW|2.0|Good character development especially Harry Hole. But the story line was very slow in developing. The story could have been woven tighter
B008MM9630|4.0|I enjoy being able to play on my kindle vs. playing similar games on my computer. Plus it allows in game purchases unlike Family Seaside.
1595828753|4.0|Big fan of Avatar, and The Promise Pt. 1 wasn't so bad. I loved the art and although the characters aren't quite like the TV series, its still nice to read.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!! Best Bingo app I've ever had!! I play on facebook and as a guest on both my kindle and my phone so I can play more!! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a Bingo app!! 5 stars all the way!!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A climactic read. I enjoyed being compelled to turn page after page wanting to see what happened next. I hope to one day be able to read a final book in a series that is as good as this was.
B000NHPCS0|5.0|This is a fantastic action packed but bloody story of the corruption with the Boston Irish and law enforcement.<br />A Must see!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Hope the movies will be closer to the book this time. November 22 ca not come coon enough. It will be awesome.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|It helps my nephew pronounce<br />SAT words that he has difficulty with. It is a really great learning tool.  Great!!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Pilars of the Earth is one of my all time favorite books and Ken Follett one of my favorite authors.  Fall of Giants, does not disappoint.  I love the interweaving story lines and I learn so much about the history of the time.  I'm going to be sad when I finish it!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Love this !!!!!!!!! Helpful, inspiring, thought provoking ~ this really helps you put things in to perspective and not dwell on the negative
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I am not a tech savvy person...I was born before all this stuff was even thought of but I'm slowly coming around and this product was so simple to use and made all my tasks so much more convenient....I love it!! I love love love it!!
B009RX85N0|5.0|The second season to this engaging series. It is still interesting the plot twists. I have enjoyed both seasons and am looking forward to the new spinoff.
B00915G6MG|5.0|My family watches NCIS as it aires each week.  If there is a night when nothing is on that we like, we put in a NCIS DVD and watch.  We have all 10 seasons.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This update needs to be fixed I can't even play multiplayer with out crashing or lagging or bugging and the typing needs to be visible cuz wen I type it looks like nothing happened but it does type other than that this uptate IS SOOOOOOOOOOO COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thx Mojang
B009P1WES6|4.0|This book was very different to what I expected. The lead female is such a different disturbed character. Worth the read.
B00280LYIC|5.0|LOVE THIS BOOK!! This book is amazing in every way I love Greek mythology so much and I can't wait to read House Of Hades
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The author demonstrates a deep involvment in his research for this book. My background in education (PhD) appreciates the effort he puts forth to carfully cite his sources. A lot of what he reveals is supported by other evidence outside the written word. Regardless of your religious beliefs, it is a worthwhile insite to the man and his time..
0385528787|5.0|I think it is the best of the trilogy, an exciting reading from page one.  The others took a little time to get into.  Scary--it is so possible.  And funny.  She has a wicked wit.  I'm a fan.
B000N2HBSO|3.0|Otherwise it is a good insight to the charm and intelligence of Lincoln. His ability to communicate ideas as well as entertain his audience with humor sheds a light on his great  charm. It also shows his excellent pokitical skill that would do well in our current stalemate. His leadership was fraught with political in fighting but, he was steadfast in his determination to keep our Union intact against all odds. As a nation, we owe him a lot.
B006RJTEIC|3.0|A very characteristic 1970's movie; full of &#34;futuristic&#34; drama with the integration of the 70's consciousness. However, very entertaining to watch and travel back in time.
B005M5PENG|5.0|This is better then the old show-I just love how this ensemble cast works together for the benefit of the show. They have such good chemistry-I will never miss an episode
B00F91RYL8|5.0|i had been hesitant to see this because it was PG13 how could it be scary? I heard everyone talking about how good it was, so we tried it. It was awesome! We watched it at least 4 times during my 48 hour rental. Best movie i've seen in awhile!
B0064MGU98|5.0|My coworkers have been talking about how great this show is! So I decided to watch season one to find out for myself and am I happy I did. Great show, wonderful cast and superb writing.
B00005N5RM|4.0|I found this movie to be awesome because it brought back memories of Saturday family night, with pizza, chips and soda. Besides it is good to watch the classic movies where there was an actual plot and less blood and gore. The movies today have more special effects then they do have real acting.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|I havent used it yet.  I am hoping to use it on my new kindle.  The other one was stolen at the airport.
B0012TWRAO|4.0|I put it on my bike for my gps so I could track my riding.  It's good and solid.  A little spendy but RAM mounts tend to be.
B008F9E306|5.0|T.I did a great job on this CD!!  He had some great additions (rappers, hip hop) artists to join him to make this one of his best CDs yet!!!
B001NHNG64|4.0|Reacher is a believable hero.  The story moves.  Anyone who likes military adventures will like this book.  I would recommend this book.
B009P5S11G|5.0|Ri Ri did a superb job on this CD!  I LOVE the song &#34;Diamonds in the Sky&#34;!  She has a great voice and talent!
0515123447|3.0|The book was all there, but whoever read it before I did had turned down the corners of multiple pages.  Not something I would do to a book.
B00FPH51LQ|1.0|I don't know what to say other than the movie wasn't very good. Some of the special effects were laughable compared to today's blockbuster standards. I can't recall any memorable quotes, the action was clumsy and relatively boring. I normally love Jeff Bridges, but he acted entirely too much with his mustache. It was like he was trying to make his mustache its own character. Character development was shallow, the &#34;twist&#34; was easily predictable. I'd rather have my hour and a half of life back than have watched this movie.
B00F9040HU|2.0|Never got to play it.  Could not get it to load onto my Kindle.  A very confusing mess so I deleted the app.  First time I have ever had a load problem.
B00DU77QP2|5.0|This book was fantastic. It has such vivid description and it's just such a clever story.<br />I actually saw the movie first before I read the book and I'd just like to say the casting for the movie is amazing, everyone looks exactly how they are described in the book, especially the male protagonist, jace.<br />If you like mystery, action, romance and the supernatural then you must not only read this book but this series!<br />If you are going to commit to reading this book you are going to have to read the first three because it's in the third book that all the mysteries (well most) are tied up and we, as the reader finally achieve catharsis. The third book is the end of that arc.<br />Basically this series is a must read and for those who have already seen the movie, reading the book after doesn't take away from it at all. There are some things that are different in the book but the humour is still there. Right, thats another thing. the characters in this book have such wit and humor that I found it so enjoyable and almost impossible to put down!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Good solid program.  Easy to use and gives a choice of download format, as well as chance to input artist and album info.  If you save music to an SD card to save space, make sure you set the SD card as default storage or you will quickly use up all your flash memory.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|. Its a cheao game and Very nice game good .. its very fun. It has cool graphics and easy to play
B009GX7IRA|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this show and season 10 was no exception! I am glad I was able to find this on here at a good price, very pleased!
B008D4AKYQ|2.0|Dear oh dear. 'Fraid to say I cannot agree with any of these 5 star reviews. I've tried to like BBT, I really have. But they are a BBB (Big Big Bore) to me. I'll concede they can play - but that's about it. Musically they are devoid of any inspiration outside of their lame channeling of Gabriel era Genesis, but without any of the memorable melodies of yore. Much instrumental noodling but little else. In fact, I find it impossible to commit any of their meandering compositions to memory, so insipid are their attempts at writing a good tune. Predictable chordings rapidly become irritating, rendering the tracks effectively indistinguishable from one other. And lyrically - I'm not sure what to say. The constant repetition of banal lines with ever increasing accompaniment, as if the very process of doing this could somehow magically transform dross into something profound and meaningful. A typical example (from the tweely entitled Winchester from St Giles Hill):<br />\\"A river flowing from the chalk hills<br />through the water meadows and the open fields.<br />Walls were made and streets were laid down,<br />halls and houses, schools and churches\\"<br />Yikes! To commit this atrocity to paper is bad enough, but then to put it to melody (or what passes in the BBT world as melody) just adds insult to injury. If their musical modus operandi is to try and force a tune around lyrics such as these, no wonder they're mired in the land of anal retention.<br />Just to make sure I wasn't being too hard on the guys, I picked another track at random (British Racing Green from Far Skies, Deep Time). No luck here, either. Here's an unfortunate and feeble attempt at pathos, marred by yet another forgettable tune and kindergarten lyrics. To wit:<br />\\"British racing green and red,<br />She looked at me.<br />We tore each others hearts out.<br />We ripped each other apart.<br />We tore each others hopes up,<br />We just gave up.<br />Gave up.\\"<br /><br />Frankly, so have I !!<br />Now where's my Selling England By The Pound?
0375815996|5.0|Loved this book as a child and this cloth book version will be perfect for my one year old niece this Christmas!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Malala is an example of what is the best in us. She has won many awards and she deserves every one of them. Her voice rises clearly above the hatred of those who want to suppress her and suppress her vision, a world of peace and freedom. She puts her life on the line every day, every time she speaks or appears in public. Buy her book, buy her audio book, download her ebook. She deserves our support. This is a powerful book. She is amazing.
