0385513755|4.0|Though I do hate the way the author cuts the several lines of story into small pieces. This might help to intrigue readers. But i found it somewhat artificial and annoying.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Ok, this album is fantastic!  It has everything a listener with peaked emotions wants, it takes you on a delicated jurney of real, intelligent and thoughtful emotion and oh yes also a powerful sound you have to sing to.  All in all a must buy!
B0009NSE1K|5.0|When I first heard this album I was pretty disapointed.  Every album in their extensive catalog is amazing and the bar was set especially high on their last album, Blast Tyrant.  The first time I listened to the Hive, I thought, \\"well, they FINALLY put out a dud.\\"  I reported my dismay to my friend and fellow CLUTCH obsessee.  He told me to give it a chance and listen to it a few times.  I did of course and my opinion has greatly changed.  This album is INCREDIBLE!!  I could listen to it every day.  I don't know how these guys can be so consistent.  CLUTCH is definitely the best band out today and should be ranked along side all-time greats like Sabbath and Zep.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I haven't seen it but I've heard good/bad things about the movie which inspires me more to wait on the DVD.  I'm going through the same situation and I hope that movie gives me the same answer in my life.
0316666343|1.0|I checked out this book on premise alone. Great premise, I have to say.  The first third of the book was well-written, and I liked her concept of a religiously neutral heaven.  But after the first hundred pages, the book started meandering.  She kept rambling on about the members of her family, and it was so distant I couldn't sympathize with anyone but Susie's little brother.  Then by the last third, it got just plain bad.  Worst. Conclusion. Ever. <br /> <br />Given the schmaltziness of most of the book, I think the author was desparately trying to get into Oprah's Book Club.  \\"Hey Oprah, I'm depressing!  Can I be in your book club too?\\" <br /> <br />So one star for the premise and the first hundred pages.  I think that's all her agent and editor read.
6305079811|5.0|It's available on Amazon Uk for about $13.00. This is the remastered version, don't pay through the nose to greedy sellers seek an alternative ;)
B0000C8AVM|5.0|All I can do is echo the reviews of others. This is well-nigh the perfect album, still a fantastic listen 20 years after I first heard it (and thrashed it over and over again). I'm personally not a huge fan of Idiot Wind and Lily, Rosemary... but every other song is just, well, transcendant. And this is an Album - not a collection of singles. It's got a unified feel. You'd die happy to have written any one of them. If you're even considering a Dylan album, buy it.
0525948023|5.0|Anyone who has lost faith in humanity and the direction we appear to be going should read this book. Tolle is an extremely spiritual and intellectual man as well as a great writer.  He  has definitely captured my attention with this book and it should be a required read for all the people in power in this country. It's inspiring, challenging and a truly great read. If you've read Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle, this is a MUST read for you.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Wrestlemania XX will remain one of my favorite Wrestlemanias ever, primarily because the two main events, especially the Raw main event. Those two matches alone are worth buying this DVD. <br /> <br />Big Show (C) v. John Cena <br />This is a pretty poor match. Put it this way, the Big Show isnt a great wrestler, and Cena only looks good when he's put in there with someone whose very talented. Not a great way to start the show, but for some reason, Cena was pretty over with the crowd so it got them pumped for the rest of the event. <br /> <br />Booker T & Rob Van Dam v. The Dudley Boys v. La Resistance v. Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade <br />This match was alright. The teams had good chemistry together, but Jindrak and Cade looked a little lost out there. The Dudleys and La Resistance are talented tag team wrestlers, and Booker and RVD always look good, so this is worth watching. <br /> <br />Christian v. Chris Jericho <br />This was a great match, with a nice surprise ending. Christian and Jericho are two very talented guys and I'm glad that they were given plenty of time for this match. This is the first really good match of the night. <br /> <br />Evolution v. the Rock & Sock Connection <br />I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Neither the Rock nor Mick Foley had wrestled recently, but they looked great out there together. Batista was dominant as always, and Ric Flair was just fun to watch. Orton looked a little lost but he pulled it together half way through and helped out the match quite a bit. <br /> <br />Torrie Wilson & Sable v. Stacy Kiebler & Jackie Gayda, Playboy Evening Gown Match <br />If you want a wrestling match, skip this one. None of these four are good wrestlers. However, they are alot of fun to look at, so if you're in to that, go ahead and take a peek. <br /> <br />Cruiserweight Invitational: Chavo Guerrero v. Jamie Noble v. Funaki v. Ultimo Dragon v. Rey Mysterio v. Nunzio v. Tajiri v. Shannon Moore v. Billy Kidman <br />Yet again the cruiserweights are not given enough time. You have some tremendous talent in here, with the likes of Mysterio, Ultimo Dragon, Tajiri and Kidman, but this match just came off hurried and dull. Still fun to watch because these guys can perform some great moves, but not as good as it should have been. <br /> <br />Bill Goldberg v. Brock Lesnar, Special Guest Referee Steve Austin <br />I really didnt expect much from this one. Lesnar is an awful wrestler and Goldberg isnt all that much better. The most interesting part of this match was listening to the fans abuse Lesnar and Goldberg. Austin really made this match interesting. Both guys were leaving the company, and really the company was better off, especially without Lesnar. Worth a laugh, but not much to see here. It was nice to see someone beat the hell out of Lesnar, who is usually just allowed to dominate. <br /> <br />Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi v. the Basham Brothers v. the APA v. World's Greatest Tag Team <br />This match was a little better than the Raw version, given the incredible talent and skill that Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas possess. Scotty 2 Hotty and Ron Simmons both looked really good out there. Even the Bashams and JBL looked okay. Rikishi was fairly typical of his normal stuff, but this is worth watching. <br /> <br />Victoria v. Molly Holly <br />This was probably the end of the woman's division on Raw. It was one of the last good women's wrestling matches. These two are fairly decent, and although having Trish and Lita in there would have made it a very good match, this was still decent, although it was way too rushed. <br /> <br />Eddie Guerrero (C) v. Kurt Angle <br />This match was great. Eddie and Kurt are two amazingly talented wrestlers and they put on a hell of a show. The ending was especially great, and this match was just so much fun to watch. <br /> <br />Undertaker v. Kane <br />While this match wasnt quite as good as the Wrestlemania XIV version, it was still pretty good. It's nice to see the Deadman Gimmic back, but I think Undertaker was a little too dominating for this match to be taken seriously instead of just as another Undertaker beating. <br /> <br />Triple H (C) v. Chris Benoit v. Shawn Michaels <br />This is easily one of the greatest matches in Wrestlemania history. These three put on a tremendous contest, that went back and forth and sideways and seemed like it could end a thousand times but someone always made the save. A very exciting match, and definitely worth the cost of the whole DVD by itself. <br /> <br />Wrestlemania ended with one of the greatest moments in wrestling history, the two champions Guerrero and Benoit, standing in the middle of the ring celebrating. Benoit finally got the recognition he deserves, even though he may never get the title back again. But what a great time for professional wrestling. Guerrero and Benoit, two tremendous wrestlers, are the champions. Compare this to after Wrestlemania XXI where Batista and Cena were champions. Notice the difference?
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Totally enjoyed the performances of Joaquin and Reese, making the movie even that much more enjoyable.  The story line was good; the talent was excellent and the acting was 'right on'!  Saw the movie 4 times and picked up more and more detail each and every time while being totally engrossed with the music and the 'times'.  Can't wait for the DVD.  Will give some of my friends who loved the movie as much as I did a copy to enjoy.  Also bought the CD and when comparing it to Johnny and June during that same era, it is incredible how similar Joaquin and Reese came to the real thing!  They deserve Oscars for sure.
B000BYA5GO|3.0|An interesting but often slow-moving film that chronicles the exploits of a fictitious international arms dealer over a period of two decades.  It is supposedly \\"based on true events,\\" and probably is -- but it's hard to believe all of those events occurred in one man's experience.  The \\"message\\" (international arms trade is bad) is delivered in a fairly heavy-handed manner, but there are occasional moments of dark humor to keep the movie from becoming too preachy.<br /><br />The production is good, if you like deliberately flat and muted photography. Cage does a decent job as the protagonist/narrator, although I found the voice-over narration tiresome after a while. The overall consensus rating of 3.5 stars is about right; I went with three stars because half-star ratings are not allowed on Amazon and I think this is slightly closer to being a 3-star entry than a 4-star.
0811828697|5.0|The Wildlife of Star Wars is a fantastic book with detailed full-color illustrations and accounts of the massice biodiversity of the Star Wars universe. From the harsh deserts of Tatooine to the dense ecosystem of the Naboo swamps, there are suprises on every page. At the back of the book is also a special section on the creatures of Alderaan, all extinct except for the thrantas of Bespin. All in all, a fantastic book, and well worth reading many times.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is an adorable movie, full of color, and life. <br />I watched this with my two teen daugthers and we could not stop smiling! Amelie makes you wish you could move to France and be her neighbor. If you like feel good movies with an underlying \\"life lesson\\"..pick this up. You will not regret it.
B000BM6AVA|2.0|I heard \\"Lonely Day\\" on the radio and thought it was a pretty good song. But when I bought the album, practically none of the songs were of that type. It's my fault for not listening to this cd before purchasing.
1932907009|5.0|this book is the single most useful book i have read on screen-writing, and i have read a lot.  written in a smart, clear, and funny style, snyder breaks down the requirements necessary for a great screenplay.   <br /> <br />struggle as we writers might against convention or formula,  the points that this books lays out are actually the fundamentals of what audiences need to see on the screen to have a genuinely emotional experience.  you can try to fight it, but it's actually just what works.   <br /> <br />while many other writing books are all esoteric principles, or feel good \\"you-can- write\\"  books,  \\"save the cat\\" gives you an easily applicable system to write a sellable,  entertaining,  and satisfying story.   once the writer accepts the notion that there are certain necessities of a screenplay, the story starts to fall into place.  it's almost like a mathematical algorithm; put in great idea, out comes a great screenplay.   <br /> <br />i have found the book extremely helpful in my own writing, and in recommending this book to friends and fellow writers, it has helped them, too. \\"save the cat\\" can jump start you out of a bad block,  help you finally figure out what needs to happen at the top of act three, or just tell you why that hero is falling flat. <br /> <br />i find this bok especially helpful when dealing with a story that feels at first like an unusual film that doesn't adhere well to a formula or genre, but really requires the extra discipline, and snyder provides it in spades.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|I love literature.  I really think Heath Ledger and Matt Damon are good actors.  Yet, for me, this movie fell flat.  As someone else mentioned, there's a fair bit of violence toward animals.  Was it crucial to the plot that horses' tails be set on fire and a cat be chopped up in a machine?  No, not really.  You could argue that the matter-of-fact skinning of a rabbit said something about the character of the huntress, but I didn't feel like it added anything GOOD to her character.  Also, if the animals of the forest could be trusted, why were the crows/ravens/etc. not trustworthy?  Weren't they animals too?<br /><br />I get the impression that I missed a lot of what was going on.  Part of this problem can be attributed to the damaged DVD we rented, but I also felt like the dialogue was garbled.  Did all the actors lose their ability to enunciate, or was there some other issue with sound?  And did I miss the reasoning behind the brothers in the French/German area having English accents?<br /><br />Additionally, I had some issues with the plot.  Was it really, really necessary to bring up the magic beans from the beginning of the movie every five minutes?  And was I really to believe that there was any kind of love exchanged between the huntress and either or both brothers?<br /><br />I've seen worse movies, and this one did have lots of funny little references to fairy tales.  But The Brothers Grimm is a shade darker than I felt it needed to be, and I don't intend to watch it again.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|I will keep this simple.  <br /> Disapointing, horrible, waste of time and money. <br /> A previous reviewer stated that you need to knock back a few  drinks to get through this movie. I agree...knock back enough to pass out...
B00082IJ08|1.0|It takes a lot for me to write an album review as I'm usually not overly swayed either way.  But in the case of Demon Days I feel compelled to let everyone know what a galactic piece of dog turd this record is..   <br />I can't understand why this album is so wildly popular.  Truthfully the only good track is Feelgood Inc.  The rest of it is a montage of random loops spliced together creating something unmusical and utterly annoying.
B00005JOMY|2.0|Dont let the casting fool you...Kilmer can act but anything with Robert  Downey jr is bound to be empty cotton candy fodder. The story is non existant, the acting woody,the script useless. <br /> <br />This movie does not deserve a look at all. <br /> <br />I really wont decend into the habit of rating films just because of well know actors are in them as those said actors have you focus on them instead of the movie it'self and thus we rank the film based on the actors' reputations instead of the quality of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />My Verdict: CRAP Film.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|I love Heath and I like Damon.  The cruelty gag-jokes against animals weren't humorous.  Needed to knock back a few drinks to watch the movie to the end.
B000AL730O|4.0|I love most of Paul's work but 2001's 'Driving Rain' was awful - ill-thought-out melodies, performed \\"live in the studio\\" (for which read \\"badly\\") and with Paul's voice losing much of its sweetness.  <br />So when C&C came out I was worried. But my God, its fantastic. Not quite up there with Band on the Run, but definitely as good as any other solo McCartney album.  <br />Lyrically it is the best thing he has done since the Beatles. In the 60s his lyrics were ground breaking but for some weird reason in the 70s, 80s and 90s they were just banal. But on C&C he has clearly spent a lot of time thinking deeply and opening himself up to us by translating these thoughts and feelings into his lyrics.  <br />Musically most of the album is first rate. The opening track, Fine Line, is a bit cloying, but Paul seemed to lose the art of writing pop singles at some point in the mid-80s. Fine Line is as good as any pop single he's written since then but remains a pale shadow of his 60s and 70s singles.  <br />The next track, 'How kind of you', is a 60s experimental throwback. Not bad, but would probably have worked better if it was placed later on the album.  <br />Thereafter the album moves up from 3-star to 4/5-star. Jenny Wren is the equal of any ballad he has written. By his own admission, its a modern 'Blackbird' (hence the name 'Wren') but despite the similarity its still refreshing. 'At the mercy' is in my view the best song he has written in over 20 years. It constantly surprises. It is the album's masterpiece. 'Friends to go' is also superb, a song that sounds like George Harrison at his best.  <br />'English Tea' is very McCartney: a 1920s Noel Coward pastiche in the vein of 'Honey Pie' on the White Album and 'You gave me the answer' on Venus & Mars. The album's only real mistake is to also include 'A certain softness' which is another 1920s pastiche, but rather less good. Paul should have saved it for his next album.  <br />'Follow me' and 'Too much rain' are musicallyless exciting but the lyrics remain strong.  <br />'Vanity Fair' is Paul in a bitter, revengeful mood. Very unusual for him, it is probably inspired by the media attacks on his wife which he has struggled to deal with. But as a song it works well, with a dark melody and production that perfectly sets off the lyrics.  <br />'Promise to you girl' is probably Paul's best piano-led rock song in years, with some very interesting chord changes.  <br />The final two tracks, This Never Happened Before and Anyway, are both solid, if not quite top quality, ballads.  <br />Overall, the main theme in this album is quality control. Every one of Paul's post-Beatles albums has had at least one masterpiece song on it (well ok, maybe 'Wildlife' didnt) but usually the albums have had a number of fillers. 1997's Flaming Pie album is a case in point: the best tracks were as good as anything the Beatles did, but then tracks such as 'Really love you', 'The world tonight' etc were just downright boring. There is none of that boredom on Chaos & Creation. Nigel Godrich is good for Paul: he keeps a disciplined approach.  <br />So why does it get 4 stars not 5? The answer is that Nigel Godrich wanted Paul's band nowhere near the studio. He probably listened to Driving Rain and realised that when Paul's mates are in the studio they just mess around and dont bother to work at songs. This was very wise. However, Paul is no lead guitarist, and the whole album lacks a lead guitar. Maybe Fine Line would have been better with a guitar solo. So when Paul next makes an album, I really hope he hires Nigel Godrich again, but this time I hope Nigel decides to let the band back in. Maybe then we'll finally get another 'Band on the Run'.
0071373586|3.0|Perhaps there is an new version but this book is far outdated with much of its references focused on the 80's and early 90's. <br /> <br />Great at getting the mind thinking about positioning. But is positioning still the best thing to think about it? Much has evolved in business and the crowded market place since this book was published. <br /> <br />In summary a great book for a step in the right direction toward positioning your product or business.
B00008BRB5|3.0|I'll have to admit that this remastered version sounds just a little better than the original but the sound quality still leaves much to be desired especially when compared to the much better job done on the other albums in the Digipak series.  They are just going to have to do a major remastering job and even search for a better condition master to truly do justice to this album which although became their best selling because of \\"Every Breath You Take\\" (come on, be honest, you know that's true)is not their best album by far anyway.<br /><br />Just because an album sells the most, it doesn't make it the best album.  Firstly, sound quality wise, this is the worst of all their albums.  I've had this album on cassette when it first came out and on a couple of cd reissues and on every one sounded very poor suggesting a poor mastering job to begin with.<br /><br />Secondly, to be a great album, it's more that just about having a few good tracks interspersed with filler tracks that don't flow and hence give the listener a sense of aural highs and depressing lows.  That's why the best Police albums in descending order of greatness are: \\"Zenyatta Mondatta\\" (every track is strong with no filler and the album flows very cohesively), \\"Regatta de Blanc\\" (ditto), \\"Ghost in the Machine\\" (6 brilliant tracks -the first and last 3-and 5 very poor ones in the middle), \\"Synchronicity\\" and \\"Outlandos D'Amour\\".<br /><br />Putting aside the terrible sound quality and the extremely commercial \\"Every Breath You Take\\", the only other tracks that rank among the best that the Police have ever done are:\\"King of Pain\\" (the best track on this album), \\"Tea in the Sahara\\" (great mood and reminicent of some of their best work on 'Regatta de Blanc'-reminds me a lot of 'Walking on the Moon' in terms of evoking a great mood) and \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\".<br /><br />We also have some passable tracks that could pass as filler for their earlier albums (or are at least better than the awful fillers on \\"Ghost in the Machine\\" such as \\"Hungry For You\\" and \\"Too Much Information\\") in \\"Miss Gradenko\\", \\"Synchronicity II\\" and maybe \\"Oh My God\\" while the rest are just too poor to mention given what the band have shown themselves capable of on previous albums.<br /><br />\\"Murder By Numbers\\" was the final bullet that murdered any pretense of cohesiveness or continuity that the album had in what was clearly an afterthought that was thrown in to fill up the space.  This track isn't bad in itself but it would clearly have been better placed on Sting's first solo effort \\"The Dream of the Blue Turtles\\" where at least it would logically fit in with the mood and character of that album.<br /><br />If you are really looking for The Police's best albums (great tracks that are cohesive and have a great overall flow with no fillers rather than just a collection of very good and very bad disjointed tracks), this is not it: get their second and third ones.awful fillers on \\"Ghost in the Machine\\" such as \\"Hungry For You\\" and \\"Too Much Information\\") in \\"Miss Gradenko\\", \\"Synchronicity II\\" and maybe \\"Oh My God\\" while the rest are just too poor to mention given what the band have shown themselves capable of on previous albums.   <br /> <br />\\"Murder By Numbers\\" was the final bullet that murdered any pretense of cohesiveness or continuity that the album had in what was clearly an afterthought that was thrown in to fill up the space.

B000001FOS|5.0|Best of the best.  Greatest guitar player on the market, though I don't care for his singing voice, but play that guitar the man's a star.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Because I would've given it a significantly lower rating. After first purchasing \\"Octavarium,\\" my initial reaction (which is usually totally wrong) was a five star rating. Very quickly, that rating dropped to about three stars and as low as two (no, I don't judge everything in life on a scale of five stars, I'm just using units of measurement). For a while, the only songs that I could listen to were the latter four of the album: \\"Panic Attack,\\" \\"Never Enough,\\" \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" and \\"Octavarium.\\" I was ready to write this review many times, yapping about just how boring it was...then something thoroughly magical happened.  <br /> <br />Suddenly, I can toss \\"Octavarium\\" into my CD player, hit the play button and - *gasp* - let it play the entire way through, keeping my attention for the whole time! No longer do I cringe when thinking of \\"The Root of All Evil,\\" \\"The Answer...,\\" \\"These Walls\\" or \\"I Walk Beside You.\\" Wow! *winks at camera* <br /> <br />The aforementioned \\"Root of All Evil\\" is fast and snakey with good, sneering vocals from James LaBrie. \\"The Answer Lies WIthin\\" is a friendly ballad that, good as it is, is still the least of the songs. \\"These Walls\\" starts with some weird grinding noises from the guitar and then explodes into a sprawling atmosphere that permeates thine ears like nuclear radiation at Hiroshima. \\"I Walk Beside You\\" has drippingly sugar sweet vocals and guitar, but it's still enjoyable (albeit, guiltily enjoyable).  <br /> <br />The second half starts with the violent \\"Panic Attack,\\" which alternates between \\"really fast\\" and \\"really f*cking fast\\" before a brief recharging period when it ingests more amphetamines before erupting again. Excellent song. Except the lyrics (O God, the lyrics...more on that later. Pretend LaBrie is babbling in Swahili). After some wanking, it settles into \\"Never Enough,\\" a swirling mess of guitars and whiny lyrics, which, for reason of the music and vocals sounds pretty good. Track seven is \\"Sacrificed Sons,\\" which is probably the best song on the album; beginning with (relatively) supple orchestrations and ending with giant riffs, it is also a great showcase of LaBrie.  <br /> <br />The closer, the mighty \\"Octavarium,\\" is 21 minutes of music and three minutes of trash. Three of the first five minutes are superfluous, but it's better to have it at the beginning of an incredibly long song and not in the middle. The first movement is soft and good, but not as good as what is to come. The second starts soft and poignant, right up to the second chorus, when the heavy guitar (finally) kicks in and complements LaBrie's vocals perfectly. Thus begins the metal portion of the song, and a mighty portion it be. The third movement features both great and cheesy vocals (something about hearing \\"speeeenning ROUND and ROUND\\" is vaguely annoying), but the music is phenomenal. The fourth movement rivals \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" as Labrie's best showing on the album, as he angrily speaks through the first couple stanzas before snarling about innocent victims of merciless crimes. It really is a kickass moment; I wish there were a few more of those on the album. Snarl, James, Snarl! Anyway, the fifth movement brings in the orchestra with some touching vocals and some of the only good lyrics of Petrucci's on the album. AND!: <br /> <br />Since I can hold it no longer, let us talk about lyrics, huh? Lyrics don't make or break albums; if they're good, then it's icing on the cake of music; if they're bad, then whatever. John Petrucci is a magnificient guitarist, but his lyrics are, and I use this world rightly, HORRIBLE.  Let's count up the songs/movements that don't make us cringe, huh? <br /> <br />1. Root of All Evil (Portney): Besides being a great drummer, Portney can write lyrics passably well. Not Cringe-Worthy (NCW). <br />2. The Answer Lies Within (Petrucci): Boring lyrics. Sappy lyrics. Sucky lyrics. CRINGE! (CX) <br />3. These Walls (Petrucci): It's not the worst song Petrucci's ever written.I give him that. It's okay. But it still sucks. \\"So much uncertainty   I don't like this feeling.\\" Oh, you don't like this feeling, huh? TOO BAD! (CX) <br />4. I Walk Beside You (Petrucci): This one isn't bad. Really? Really. Passable. (NCW) <br />5. Panic Attack (Petrucci): Terrible. Most embarrassing moment is \\"IIIIIIII feeel like I'm in daaangaaahr.\\" Miserable. (CX) <br />6. Never Enough (Portnoy): It's okay. Whiny, but okay. \\"My blood spilled on your brand new floor\\"? That gets it a (CX). <br />7. Sacrificed Sons (LaBrie): Wonderful vocals, mediocre lyrics. Switches between literal translation and crappy metaphors. (CX) <br />8. (Oct) Someone Like Him (Petrucci): No. (CX) <br />Medicate (Awakening) (LaBrie): This I like, it sounds sincere (NCW). <br />Full Circle (Portney): Besides the aforementioned \\"spinning\\" part, this is pretty good. I like the flowing titles. (NCW) <br />Intervals (Portney): Now this is good stuff. Only complaint is \\"try to escape but to no avail.\\" But good. (NCW) <br />Razor's Edge (Petrucci): Short, but Petrucci's best lyricsl effort. Completely out of character. Maybe someone wrote it for him (NCW). <br /> <br />Add it all up!: Labrie: 1/2 CX, Petrucci: 3/5, Portnoy: 1/3 <br /> <br />Portnoy wins! w00t! (for all it's worth) <br /> <br />Anyway, lyrics aside, \\"Octavarium\\" takes time to get into but still rocks. Get it.
B0000027RL|5.0|Not only is the album in question one of my personal favorites, but to the right music lover, in the right state of mind, it posesses the ability to remove your soul from your body.  If you truely follow each note Eddie Vedder spews from his soul, hang on each slow change of tune from Mike McCready's guitar, and feel the sometimes animal energy and passion contained here within.

0790733226|5.0|Contact is the story of humans' first contact with something from space.  Ellie (Jodi Foster) spends her whole career listening for sounds from space.  Along the way she meets Palmer (Matthew McConaughey), a man concerned with how scienctific discovery and technology affect human welfare and religion.  These two characters have very different religious viewpoints, and I feel like the differences were handled well.  The debate could have gone on endlessly, but that wasn't the point of the movie, and once it reached the fundamental divide between faith vs. proof they let it go. <br /> <br />The movie was well-acted by all the characters.  Jodi Foster plays a very convincing obsessed scientist, and Matthew McConaughey is a thoughtful counterpoint.  Personally, I think the downfall to a lot of science fiction movies is that the characters are too attractive and the movie gets wrapped up in their romantic relationships.  Contact kept the science on mainstage with brief cameos from other topics, which was great! <br /> <br />Contact brings the viewer in and forces you to think about really important issues and how you would react to the events that unfold.  Plus the space images were awesome!  Loved it!

I picked up the dvd too and between this and the Fretboard Workbook things are starting to come together. These books are the only ones I'm using now. Maybe I'll try and sell the rest of my collection on Amazon!
068987474X|4.0|Simply put.....I couldn't agree more with the premise of this book.  Through my work as The Love Coach, I have seen so many women waste time making excuses for men who have short-changed them on the relationship front.  They date almost with blinders on because they want to remain hopeful, yet there are red flags along the way that they might have picked up if they were clued in.<br /><br />The point is....don't waste time with someone who isn't into you...and this book makes that point over 'n over again, and it's a lesson worth learning, so you can go on and meet the \\"mensch\\" who is deserving of you.  (Mensch is a decent, responsible person.)
B00000K19E|5.0|This film is great. It is great not because it is action-packed, but because it is very philosophical. If it leads to fundamental questions like `Is reality an illusion?', then it points to the NSTP (Non - Spatial Thinking Process) theory, the idea that space is a virtual reality, a form of non-spatial mind. So according to the theory not space and spatial entities but non-spatial feelings or states of consciousness are the real physical or material substance in the universe. And there is probably a central non-spatial program that controls or modulates these (human or any non-superhuman) feelings. This idea, a major part of the superultramodern science, is supposed to be a possible solution to most of the most challenging problems in modern science/philosophy, including the wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics. Though we live in a spatial matrix, in reality the universe has no geometry. See the film. And read the theory. It might change the way you look at the world and yourself.

0790744295|4.0|When this movie came out, I was in Junior High school.  My friends and I could recite every word from every character and every TV program from all five minis.  Watching it over 20 years later provides for great deja vu, nostalgic fun.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to any of today's teenage horror fans, but those of us in our early 30s and older and were big fans as kids would love it, regardless of the poor DVD transfer and lack of extras.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Forget the aristocratic Gordon Sumner, Trent Reznor surely deserves the King Of Pain mantle thanks to his seething, surging and sometimes soothing brand of industrial innovation. Four studio albums in 16 years is hardly prolific, but considering the way Trent Reznor has busied himself with external projects over the years it almost seems that the Nine Inch Nails banner has become quite a burden for him thanks to the benchmarks set with each release. Even side-projects helmed while escaping from the NIN bandwagon - including collating film soundtracks for Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers and David Lynch's Lost Highway - have unexpectedly earnt a level of success that further elevated Reznor's status above early industrial contemporaries such as KMFDM and Ministry. With previous albums The Downward Spiral and The Fragile offering staggering tracks such as Closer, March Of The Pigs, The Day The World Went Away and The Wretched, it was no wonder Reznor was consistently voted by music magazines as one of the most progressive and important music makers of the 1990s. But it's the 2000s now, and times change. Now free of the drink and drugs that spurred on his narcissism last decade, does the maestro still have what it takes? For much of With Teeth, Trent seems similarly unsure of where he now stands in rock's hierarchy, relying on reheated Downward Spiral imagery (the insects of Reptile reappear on opening track All The Love In The World, Ruiner's collector reappears on The Collector and Piggy's manifesto `Nothing Can Stop Me Now' is repeated on Sunspots. While the frenetic nature of You Know What You Are? similarly cannot escape comparison to the prior jolting thrill of March Of The Pigs, awesome current single The Hand That Feeds shows an almost vaudevillian flair for synthesisers and showmanship that make The Killers' Brandon Flowers look like a rookie. While the instrumental wonderlands of The Fragile have been avoided on With Teeth, the syncopated style of Love IsNot Enough, the dirty guitar haze of The Line Begins To Blur and the funky bass growl of the title track show that Reznor has lost none of his musical chops. While early listens assure that With Teeth fits snugly into the Nine Inch Nails canon, it is the incredible nature of closing track Right Where It Belongs that confirms this latest album's potency. Canny Trent Reznor has always known how to draw emotions from his listeners perhaps better than any other rock gent, moving from the aggressive sounds of Heresy to the emotive Hurt in the space of an album. Right Where It Belongs rivals Hurt (covered touchingly by a dying Johnny Cash in 2003) for honesty and passion, sung from the perspective of a troubled man regaining belief in himself and his muse. Early reviews may have dismissed With Teeth as a straight-forward rock album, but lyrically Trent is tussling with so much more than this flippant surmise suggests. With Teeth is another Nine Inch Nails opus - let's just hope it isn't another five years before this auteur returns with another.
B000002O4X|2.0|I love watching the film and about every 6 months I watch it again. I enjoy it not only for the wonderful work of art it is but for the majestic score.  But the soundtrack album doesn't give the majesty of the full experience of the visuals along with the sound. The soundtrack, divorced from the movie, is a bit boring, though beautiful.

1932907009|5.0|SAVE THE CAT! is an invaluable tool for any screenwriter or industry professional. Blake Snyder, a very accomplished screenwriter-with a long and successful track record writing and selling spec's, compiles practical and straight forward information into a concise and succinct text.  Having attended Blake's Save The Cat! writing workshop, I can say that his methods have greatly improved my writing and have taught me the skills necessary to write and sell a script.  I look forward to his next book SAVE THE CAT! GOES TO THE MOVIES...
B000777J2S|5.0|What can I say, I dig this guys sound. It's pretty different, and yes blue and glum at times, and definitely unconventional sounding. But I like piano music, and this guys voice is captivating I thought, heck I bought the album after trying it out that same day at Tower. It's cool, makes me think about things I dont often think about, death, heart wrenching need for forgiveness, honest sadness truth and emotion. This guys sincere, and I respect him for that. Looking forward to seeing more productions. Fistfull of love is cool, sort of a different take from most the other songs, Lou Reed gets up on there; I love the horns. Basically this album provides for me a good emotional template which I am able to insert many of my life experiences in (recently a tough breakup) thus allowing me to relate to his music. Take a shot, try it out.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|I've dreamed of seeing Coldplay live. Ever since they first came out and performed live in many award shows, I was enamored to their intimate and yet rock innovated performances that makes you hungry for more. Until I do get to see them live, this DVD will appease my appetite. I notice that many reviewers were disappointed by this DVD, which i could understand. But no concert DVD is perfect, you have to actually be at the concert to truly enjoy it. But for the price, it's not bad, and if you look past the tiny flaws this concert will truly be a wonderful experience to view over and over again. Coldplay is the best British band of today's generation. It shows in their albums, their singles, and their concerts. They continuously experiment with rock while still conveying an aura of intimacy and personal reflections in their lyrics and performances. Really, don't judge a concert DVD so technically. It's not meant to be perfect. At the end what should matter most is the experience, the feeling, and the emotion you get out of the live performances. I am sure most of us who have bought this DVD can say that we got some type of feeling or emotion out of it that makes the tiny flaws very obsolete and nearly non-existant. Just chill and enjoy the music.
B00005UEAR|5.0|I flippin' love this band, my all-time favorite! I'll cut to the chase real quick, cuz I have a lot to say... <br /> <br />Disc: 1        <br />1. The Glass Prison - ...OH MY GOD! HOLY CRAP! Those words went through my head when I first heard this song. My favorite song the band has ever done, also their heaviest. The intro is the static that ended \\"Finally Free\\" from SFAM. This...song...is..UNBELIEVABLE!!! After the static, John Petrucci plays a clean guitar riff over John Myung's bass-line, only to be buried under a MASSIVE B5 seven-string guitar chord. It goes into it's REAL infamous intro. After that, and a quick keyboard duty from Jordan Rudess, it gets MUCH faster and heavier, followed by a MINDBLOWING arpeggio guitar solo over Mike Portnoy's MINDBLOWINJGLY fast double bass. Then the main riff repeats a few measures, followed by Portnoy singing \\"Cunning, baffling, powerful...\\" then James LaBrie singing \\"Been beaten to a pulp...\\", etc. for a few measures, followed by LaBrie singing into a voice distorter, some singing in the background, then a brief chorus. This is followed by the intro repeated, then an absolutely BRUTAL (for DT, this is not Pantera) breakdown, then Petrucci doing a call-and-response vocal approach with LaBrie: \\"RUN - Fast, from the wreckage of the past, a shattered glass prison wall behind me,\\" under Petrucci's continually bludgeoning riffs. Then a different brief chorus of \\"Help me, I can't break out this prison all alone...\\" Then a verse with Petrucci and LaBrie swapping lyrics, then LaBrie, again, goes from the point of view of AA. Then the chorus repeats, which is followed by Myung's fats bass solo - signalling the beginning of the instrumental segment. Next is a wah-wah solo form Petrucci, then a solo from Rudess, a shredding solo from Petrucci, then a solo by Rudess, all topped with a unison-solo between them. This mighty song is topped by an amazing outro. \\"Way off in the distance I saw a door, I tried to open.I tried forcing with allof my will but still, the door wouldn't open. Unable to trudt in my faith I turned and walked away, I looked around felt a chill in the air, took my will and turne dit over. The glass prison which once held me is gone, a long lost fortress, armed only with liberty and the key of my willing ness. Fell down on my knees and prayed 'thy will be done.' I turned around saw a light shining through, the door was wide open. &lt;glass breaks>\\" Holy crap, I ranted about this song a lot! <br />  <br />2. Blind Faith - After TGP, we get a much osfter, but still heavy song. The lyrics, I believe, are about over-religious people who \\"blinfly\\" follow God. A great song, i love that guitar solo. <br /> <br />3. Misunderstood - things start to take a turn. The song is much softer than the last two. I believe this song is about Petrucci himself. \\"If I seem superhuman, I have been misunderstood.\\" It then gets into a HEAVY chorus. It ends by flowing into the next song... <br /> <br />4. The Great Debate - Back to the heavier style of track 1, is TGD. The song is about one of today's most controversial issues: stem cell research. Petrucci himself does not take a side, that is the listener's own interpretation. the riff at around 8:50 is HEAVY. Then comes a keboard solo, finished with an AMAZING guitar solo. This song flows into the next song... <br />  <br />5. Disappear - An AMAZING ballad. It reminds me of \\"Space-Dye Vest.\\" It starts with a weird keyboard intro, then an acoustic guitar riff, then LaBrie singing \\"Why...Tell me the reasons why...\\" This is a very sad, melancholic song. The last verse, IMO, is very powerful and emotional. It's hard believe this song and TGP were done by the same band. An amazing ballad, a great close to disc 1... <br /> <br />Disc: 2        <br />Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence: <br />HA! Here we are with the centerpiece of this album! It's VERY hard to review it as a whole, so I'll do it track by track. Also, go to DTFAQ to learn the meanings...  <br />1.Overture - A brilliant piece of orchestra music by Rudess. IU think he should write the score for a movie! <br /> <br />2. About To Crash - A great poppy, but oretty heavy song. It has a cheery keyboard at the beginning, then is followed by great guitar riffs. <br /> <br />3. War Inside My Head  - MUCH hevaier than the last one. At only 2 minutes, DT's sortest song ever, I believe. The intro \\"solo\\" is cool, followed by a heavy chord. <br /> <br />4. The Test That Stumped Them All - the heaviest part of the song, with a crazy guitar/keyboard intro going into a HEAVY Pantera-esque riff. The guitar and keyboard solos are great. <br /> <br />5. Goodnight Kiss - A VERY beautiful song, with a melodic intro. Reminds me of \\"The Spirit Carries On,\\" since it's a ballad that goes into an amazing guitar solo. <br /> <br />6. Solitary Shell - A VERY catchy and poppy song. the verses and chorus are very neat, the verses feature great singing from Labrie backed by Petrucci. Nice endning. <br /> <br />7. About To Crash (Reprise) - The reprise! Heavier intro, but is still catchy. Goes heavier towards the end then goes slower into... <br /> <br />8. Losing Time/Grand Finale  - ...this amazing outro. The lyrics, the music, everything about this song is epic! <br /> This song alone is worth buying the album! The lyrics at the end also give a brief summary of the previous songs... <br /> <br />Deception of fame-About to Crash and the reprise <br />Vengeance of war-War Inside My Head <br />Lives torn apart-The Test That Stumped Them All <br />Losing oneself-Goodnight Kiss <br />Spiraling down-Solitary Shell <br />Feeling the alls closing in-Losing Time <br />A journey to find the answers inside out illusive mind-Grand Finale! <br /> <br />It all ends with a drum ender and a GONG DRUM followed by 2 minutes of feedback. <br /> <br />If you don't like this album, you don't deserve ears.
B0000AE8RU|1.0|Terrible!  The center of pitch is off the scale (both choral and instrumental).  The soloists are amature at best. The orchestra does not play well, nor do they play in tune.  The chorus does not display good choral phrasing or choral tone. This is not worth the money I spent on this recording.
B000002UAR|5.0|It's really great to be able to say that, because it's true.<br /><br />Buy several copies.<br /><br />Give one to your mom, your milkman, your priest, your teacher, your children, your doctor, your girlfriend, your friends, your enemies and Dick Cheney.<br /><br />Then turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream.
B00005JKHP|1.0|Oh, yeah, the enhanced scenery was nice, in some cases even better than the original, but for a long-time Star-Trek fan like me, this version (The Director's Edition) has one modification that totally ruined it. One of the scenes in the all important climax, the one where Decker remarks: \\"But of course! We all create God in our own image.\\" was dropped from this version, no doubt in deference to the more pious consumers. Now this remark was not gratuitous, it was the main moral message and lesson of the entire adventure and an intrinsic aspect of the Star Trek phenomenon which made it (Star Trek) what it is today.<br /><br />Dropping those two lines from the movie changed it from a deeply significant work to just another shaggy-dog story. Boo! Mr. Director. I will hunt down and buy the original cut, thank you.
B000BUYP4Q|4.0|I must say out of the entire series of Batman movies, this one is the best. It makes the most sense. I loved the way it followed to life of Bruce Wayne in terms of how he actually becomes Batman. The other films didn't really do this, and if they did, somehow I missed it. It's my thought that the other films focused too much on the stars, and not enough on the story of Batman, itself. This movie is more closely related to the comic strip. It shows Batman as the dark character he is, without, compromising his compassion. This is a must see. I recommend it. I enjoyed it very much!!!

0066620996|5.0|This book debunks, through careful research, the myths of what makes corporate excellence . Forget slogans, fads, super-egos and the like....it is all wrong (this is a paraphrase of Collins from an interview)<br /><br />After sorting down a large array of companies, Collins with his research crew distill the essence of select companies' success.<br /><br />The findings are surprising since we have been led to believe for years that CEO's like Jack Welch were the final word in corporate excellence.<br /><br />One short hand idea from the book: First who, then what.<br /><br />It is a easy, quick read. The ideas presented can be applied below the corporate level and shed insight in how to become great.
0689865384|5.0|It only takes about a chapter to really get into the book, but once you are you can't set the book down. What I liked most about the book were the views the author had on how the \\"Rusties\\", or us 21st century people, destroyed the world with our careless ways with the environment. I was agreeing with the book, and it really shows how overrated prettiness is. I recommend this book to anyone who's up to reading an incredibly well-written book.
B00000JNNY|5.0|I once was the proud owner of Etta James vinyl LP: \\"Etta James' Top Ten\\". So, when I saw this CD at my local record store and noticed it had several of the tracks I loved in the vinyl LP form...I bought it! <br />Man, Etta has a way with phrasing! Etta has that tear in her voice on chestnuts like \\"At Last\\", \\"Trust In ME\\" and \\"My Dearest Darling\\". <br />The track not included on this CD that was on the Top Ten album, \\"Pushover\\" was a gem. <br />But here are included 2 awesome duets with Harvey Fuqua (formerly of The Moonglows) \\"Spoonful\\"  and \\"If I Can't Have You\\". On both of these tunes Harvey and Etta compliment each other's unique vocalizing. <br />\\"Sunday Kind Of Love\\" and \\"Stormy Weather\\" are classics! <br />As a matter of fact......as R&B singers go...Etta James is the only one who comes close to Aretha Franklin's claim to \\"Queen of Soul\\"! <br /> <br />

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I saw the movie at the theater last week and fell absolutely in love with it. Having just read the book again before watching the movie, I was able to notice how similar the script was to Austen's novel and how well her wit was captured.<br /><br />What I want to know is if any deleted scenes or alternate endings will be available in the DVD version or not, because having watched the film outside the US, I watched a different ending.
0440237688|5.0|This book terrified me. And I loved every word of it.<br /><br />The \\"Release\\" was haunting. How far are we from a society that kills people on a whim because they aren't convenient? I'll tell you: we're there already. Have you ever heard the term \\"abortion\\"? Just because a baby has not been born does not mean it is not a human being. People who are shocked at the concept of Release perhaps have not heard their counterparts in this world: Abortion and euthanasia for the old.<br /><br />Jonas was a great character. He was sympathetic and EMPATHETIC. When Gabriel was scheduled for Release, I was so scared until I read that line, so dramatically put right after the lines describing how he left (sorry if this is slightly off, I don't have the book with me):<br /><br />\\"He had hesitated for a moment in taking this, not wanting anything of his father's and unsure whether he would be able to ride the larger bike. But it was necessary because it had the child's seat in the back.<br />And he had taken Gabriel, too.\\"<br /><br />I loved that line. One of my favorites. Then there was the equally haunting scene in which Jonas asks his parents whether they love him. They laughingly reply that 'love' is a vague word, and that they enjoy him and take pride in his accomplishments -- but no, they do not love him. Directly after, Jonas whispers to Gabe how, if everyone had the memories, there could be grandparents, and colors, and choices, and animals...and -- \\"Gabe?...There could be love.\\"<br /><br />I am surprised so many people found the end \\"disturbing\\", yet the same thing is happening in our world as we speak. Infants and the elderly are being killed for the sake of convenience. Yet when you read about it in a book, away from the comfortable mindset of \\"It's not even born...won't feel a thing...maybe it's not even really alive...\\" or \\"He's not long for this world anyway...so much trouble to keep healthy...\\", when you're away from this mindset, it is shocking and disturbing.<br /><br />Thank you so much, Lois Lowry. Maybe this is what people need to see before they can understand the horrifying things being done in today's world, glossed over and even advocated nowadays.<br /><br />Rating: Very Goodwhat people need to see before they can understand the horrifying things being done in today's world, glossed over and even advocated nowadays.

0393307050|5.0|To my great surprise, this is NOT an action/adventure story, but a &#34;novel of manners&#34; just as one might describe the novels of Jane Austen or W.M. Thackery. While full of battles and dangers of every other sort, the emphasis in not on the actions, but on the reactions of the participants.  One page is spent describing the taking of a city, while an entire chapter discusses the emotional and political aftermath of this event. Having read so many novels of this time period, I was delighted to be introduced to a whole new sub-culture never seen in the more famous contemporary novelists of the 18th and early 19th centuries. How WOULD a cabin boy address his Captain?  How would a Captain address an Admiral... or a Governor... or Judge?  That's all here, with the slang and figures of speech only a true historian could begin to authenticate. I'm no historian, but the language rings true. Lovely and fascinating.
6305827079|3.0|The Elvis documentary released in late '70 was something like several of his *features* - it coulda been alot better. Yes, there should have been more concentration on the concert as not only an event but as an experience with a beginning, middle, and end. The show builds and suddenly we're in a hotel room with a fan; then back to Elvis. Suddenly, we're overseas and Presley imitators take up the screen. And too much show business *business*, if-you-will: like, the souvenier stands are to the right.<br /><br />But the original release had warmth...and \\"heart\\": an International employee and fan is interviewed prior to the performance and then is photographed at the show, rockin' in his seat. And, generally, the close-ups of fans prior to and during the show is something that future documentary makers should have learned from: live pop-rock music thrives on audience reaction and most concert tapes I've seen keep the cameras too focused on the stage.<br /><br />The expanded offer basically changes the format from documentary to concert. Then, amazingly, eliminates material which (for me) made the release a (flawed but genuine) classic: \\"I Just Can't Help Believing\\" should have remained the absolute centerpiece. Perhaps it was removed, along with others, to make room for originally unused performances - found on another package! \\"The Lost Performances\\"!!<br /><br />As another Amazon reviewer noted, editing out \\"I Just Can't...\\" really messes up the great bit with Elvis and Charlie Hodge when it appears Big El nervously suggests placing the lyric sheet on a bench on stage.<br /><br />The new edition certainly is worthwhile for the deep fan. For example, the long take of \\"Little Sister\\"/\\"Get Back\\" during rehearsal is something to revisit more than occasionally.
B0002G2B2M|4.0|I'm sure watching this a few times will have the effect of erasing any confusion you might have.  I am sure.  But...well, I can't recall if I ever saw this film.  Yet, yet...  There's Jim Carrey in my mind playing a straight role.  Sorta straight.  Actually Kate Winslet has most of the good comedic lines.  I can't tell whether she was once a girl friend of mine or if I watched her in a movie.  She says she's high maintenance and she has to have a different color for her hair every week.  Yeah, I remember her.  My god she was nice.  Quirky, but nice.<br /><br />And then she erased all memory of me.  I saw her in this book store and she pretended she didn't know me.  Didn't know me!  Wow, after all we had been through.  I mean she's an emotional roller coaster.  And that really dissed me off so I had my memory of her erased.  And then we began to see each other in strange places, on the beach--but that was right.  I met her on the beach.  But then I was a child and she was there under the kitchen table, and my mom washed me in the sink and I felt so secure and Clementine oh my darling you are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry Clementine was so, so sweet and so so pretty and just a nut case.<br /><br />And then there's Kirsten Dunst, she of the incredibly agreeable figure, dancing over my body as I lay electronically stoned.  Mary, her name is.  She and the doc had this fling.  He would get her to somehow seduce him and then erase the memory and then get her to do it again.  Really bummed his wife out.<br /><br />Oh, but Clem and I are here as on a darkling plain where ignorant armies clash by night and I think something's missing, the ground or the sky or some wall or maybe something is fused together that shouldn't be fused together, like this old house on the beach that Clem broke into, I mean she has balls, and I was just a fraidy cat, and wait, wait, I am gaining control.  She and I together are chasing down the missing parts of our memories erased by the evil Lacuna Inc. people.  All these memory movies going through my head--Memento (2000) especially, by Christopher Nolan.  There's something going on here with these memory movies.  I think Oliver Sacks has something to do with it.  Are we just our memories, and who would we be without our memories?  Would life be worth living?  If we just lived in the here and the now would we be animals?<br /><br />Anyway, this is a love story, the love story of my life.  But is it possible to selectively erase memories?  I mean creating lacunar infarcts on purpose?  Is that legal?  It is safe?  Lacunar infarcts come from strokes that leave little blank spaces in your brain so that you're missing something like the memory of your first kiss or the time you saw Wayne's World..<br /><br />Okay, this is science fiction like Vanilla Sky (2001) with Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz.  The dialogue is really sharp with all sorts of witticism written mostly by screenwriter Charlie Kaufman who also wrote the script for Being John Malkovich (1999).  Need I say more?  I mean clever with a capital K.  By the way, idle thought: Clementine's last name is Kruczynski.  Isn't that the Unibomber's last name, good old Ted?  No, that was Kaczynski.  Okay, never mind.  Anyway, here's a clever line: \\"Are we like couples you see in restaurants?  Are we the dining dead?\\"  I think I said that, or wish I had.  Or, \\"Drink up young man.  It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.\\"  She said that, and I guess she oughta know, heaven help us, from first hand experience.<br /><br />Look, if I ever, but ever, get a chance to fall in love with Kate Winslet, please, please, do NOT erase the memory.  Thank you.<br /><br />Bottom line: bizarro and entertaining, witty and cute, with a nice cast.  And Jim Carrey as a straight up kinda guy is a terrific actor, and Kate, well I'll tell you a secret, gentlemen.  You can see a full frontal sans clothes shot of her in the movie Jude (1996).  Yes.  Also worth watching is her debut film Heavenly Creatures (1994) shot when she was 18.<br /><br />One last line, as Joel says, \\"Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.\\"s 18.    One last line, as Joel says, \\"Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.\\"

B00007LTIA|2.0|me too, i've been listening to this great band since about 1970.  i even saw them open for elp in philadelphia.  they were amazing!!  recently, i've been picking up their remastered material and have been thrilled to rediscover them, at least up until i relistened to tales...  now i remember why i pretty much lost interest in them after this album, with the exception of relayer.  i never thought i'd agree with the critics of prog rock, having always loved it; from early yes to early genesis, to caravan, etc.  i'm disappointed to say, but this album is practically unlistenable.  sorry, guys.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|got this one cuz I heard \\"Night Zombies\\" on the radio.  I thought that the song was outstanding, and the rest of the album by and large lives up to the high standard of \\"Night Zombie\\".  It kind of made me mad that the one UFO sighting he sings about was the one in Highland.  Dig deeper Sufjan, the most famous UFO sighting was in Millstadt bout 10 years ago.  They did an expose about it on ABC for chrissake!
0525948023|5.0|I've read numerous books and listened to countless audio books over the past 15 years. \\"A New Earth\\" has the best and most simple explanation of the Ego that I've come across. Suddenly you see things differently, and gain an understanding of how the Ego tries to rule your life. Clearly a must-read.  <br />Given the quality of this book, I decided to add my first Amazon review. Take the time to let the ideas sink in, and start to observe your life, and notice how present you are. <br /> <br />
0393317552|3.0|Provocative concerning geography's impact on culture but flawed and inconsistent in its attempt to prove that races are of equal intelligence is how I would discribe Guns, Germs, and Steel. Jared Diamond definitely needs to study more evolutionary biology. I recommend THE BEAK OF THE FINCH as a good place to start in order to understand how quickly evolution can and does occur. Whether survival advantages conferred on the most future oriented or small tribal populations which benefited from a kind of genetic  drift roulette wheel the evidence shows that races are not of equal intelligence. Even homogeneous populations within racial groups show remarkable differences in intelligence. On the other hand  the impact on culture caused by the ebb and flow of people across Eurasia is quite convincing.

Now I have the DVD and I still love working out to this video. The music is good and Cindy looks great. It goes a little fast, but no pain, no gain - right?
B000002LGQ|5.0|1989's \\"Like A Prayer\\" was the first Madonna song I ever liked. This was probably the first song I ever Liked In the first place. This Album version is great, and is the radio edit version or video version. It is a very powerful version of this already powerful song.It is the rock version of the song with the soaring Choir.  In some ways it is better then the Pop of the 12 Dance Mix. If you are after real Rock then this album version is the one for you. I loved earlier Madonna efforts, but \\"Like A Prayer\\" is the singers best song. How could anybody not be captured by this powerful song ? It is so full of emotion and is a musical masterpiece.<br />  The 1989 Video that accompanied the song was also great with it's burning crucifixes and Madonna kissing a black saint.<br />This was definitley the Rock'n'Roll Madonna presented on this album. I thought it was great to see Madonna a vixen dancing in the Pul Pit.<br />  If this album was to be remastered( Which It doesen't need to be, because the 1989 original recording on C.D. sounds good enough already ) I would have liked to see the 12 Dance Mix of \\"Like A Prayer\\" included as a bonus track because that version of the song sounds great also.<br />  Anyway apart from the great Title Track there are other great songs on this album, and if you have heard the album you will find it is a very deep and theatrical piece of work from Madonna.<br />  \\"Express Yourself\\" ushered in Madonna's Power House phase, as it unveiled a strong independent and ultimatley edgier sound, and later led to hits such as \\"Vouge\\" and \\"Justify My Love\\". This one isn't one of my favourites on the album, but it is quite good.<br />  \\"Love Song\\" with Prince was a total Throw Away track I thought, and is one of Madonna's worst songs. It isn't terrible sounding, but it doesn't have enough substance for a good Madonna song.<br />  \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\" is a catchy little pop song on the album and is much better then Love Song. It talks about a failing relationship between a man and a woman. This album tends to sometimes deal with the reality and un-fairness of life, and this is why so many people found they could relate to it. Even though the songs sometimes have rather deep messages This particular song still manages to sound very fun and is just a Pop song from Madonna.<br />  \\"Promise To Try\\" is where the album gets a bit deep. This is a haunting sounding song about Madonna's Mother, who she lost at only the age of five. This song is very personal to Madonna and full of emotion. This is what makes the album so great to listen to, because it is the first time the public ever got to see and hear a deeper Madonna who had substance, and wasn't producing mere good sounding Pop songs. The album showcases many songs of substance and this is one of them.<br />  \\"Cherish\\" takes you away from the seriousness of the previous track, and allows you some time to zone out to a typical highly polished  Madonna Pop song. This in my oppinion is one of Madonna's best pop songs of her career.<br />It is simply just very catchy, and sounds great.<br />  \\"Dear Jessie\\" is a sweet song that sounds like a lullabye and it does sound quite babyish, but \\"Like A Prayer\\" is an album that is about childhood innocence and Dreams and because of this it is a beautiful album full of thought and Substance.<br />Dear Jessie captures this perfectly, and is delightful to hear. It captures the albums side of childhood and innocence very well.<br />  \\"Oh Father\\" returns to the theatrical and more serious side of the album. In a way it displays a dark part of Madonna's past and songs such as this one and \\"Promise To Try\\" are biographical of Madonna, and give the album a much more personal and humane feel. This is why it is good for fans because it was her most personal effort at the time, and remains so today. In all it offers a good insight to Madonna.<br />The song is quite moody and talks about Madonna's father in the abscence of her Mother. This song is deep, beautiful and contributes a lot of the albums atmosphere that is showcased.<br />  \\"Keep It Together\\" is a song that brings back the albums Pop side. This is a mediocre pop song from madge, and talks about the importance of family. It sounds very 80's and fits in well with the album. It talks about how Madonna wanted to get out of her home and become a Star and live life independently. But she realizes her family is still important and she still loves them.<br />  \\"Pray For Spanish Eyes\\" is a beautiful spanish sounding song. It tells the story of a woman who has a love who has to go off to war to fight for his country. The Eyes are a part of the body that displays a persons emotion and soul the most, and Madonna claims that she falls in love with his eyes.<br /> The song is very romantic and has a sense of Beauty about it. A True essence of Love is really captured in this song.<br />  \\"Act Of Contrition\\" is an outro for the album, and even though quite strange it wraps up the album nicely. The bit where Madonna screams \\"What Do You Mean It's Not On The Computer ?\\" is really ammusing.<br /><br /> Overall this album is really Deep and emotional, and any one who is a deep thinker will find substance here. Anyone who is shallow and ignorant will find nothing enjoyable in this album, because they can not relate to it. This album is not for Shallow people. It is an album for people who have a deep pool of thoughts, and time to think. They will find comfort in some of the songs in this album, and this is one Madonna album that many people will find an enjoyable listen.<br />  Madonna's 1989 effort is a Masterpiece and ensured she ended the 1980's in a very big way.'s father in the abscence of her Mother.

0440241588|1.0|This is by far the worst thing John has written. Will he ever write like he did in the 90's? John has gotten to rich to write good books anymore. This story was looooooooooong and drawn out to the point of just plain boreing. I miss the good ole days when I could not wait for the next book to come out. Bottom line, this book sucks and was the worst in a long line of flops. Maybe next time.
B00000GV55|5.0|An excellent dose of 70s avant-prog, obviously influenced by King Crimson. Non-derivative, but not as ambitious as their later work. The guitar tone is absolutely searing. Not quite as wonderful as the Henry Cow that was to be, but excellent nonetheless and essential the the collection of anyone into prog or avant-rock.
B00097DXZS|1.0|I'm personally not the biggest Santana fan in the world even though i think his older stuff was very good, was never a fan of the whole Guest Pop Artist genre that he's dragging through the mud. Why do i say he should be sued? Well anyone who is this protective about there music(including Metallican't) should not be aloud to put out CD's. I myself have never and won't buy any CD-thats mainstream and has any kind of copyright protection, its rediculous, all these artists and record companies keep trying to come up with ways to keep the comsumer from \\"sharing\\" there music with other people. As if making a lot of once free P2P file sharing programs charge 99 or 89 cents a song(which the artists still don't approve of) they are now installing virus's on the CD's...whats next, putting Anthrax in the sleeve to kill the fan who bought it when it opens? <br /> <br />I myself download music for the two main reasons and will gladly use my freedom of speech to say so. <br />1. The price of Cd's is outrageous, even though companies like Best Buy, and Circuit City have lowered the prices a bit, they still usually don't carry anything i listen to. I myself am more of an obscure metal fan, so i don't think there's any threat of me drying up the music market from downloading. In fact the bands i listen to WELCOME it because a lot of them are aspiring artists wanting to get there stuff out there and APPRECIATE there fans at any cost. The music industry in general is all about the mighty dollar and how successful the bands become, instead of how good the music is and how much the band members love to play it, thats sad, even pathetic. Hense why i listen to underground music. <br />2. I'm not spending 15 bucks or more on a CD that i may like 1 or 2 songs on, then, stick it on the shelf so it collects dust for years to come. I'd rather pick and choose the music i like and even buy a CD after downloading it first, so see its \\"not\\" stealing as people say. This practice has been going onfor many years with the inception of Beta and VHS tapes, and will never stop. People buy IPODS, and MP3 players for the sole purpose of starting a music library, which the music industry is trying to stop, yeah, ok lets just stop all production of Burners, Players, VCR's, and tape decks to, that'll happen. Also another point is that the big money these artists make in on tour, i repeat on TOUR, not on CD sales. So in all this being said Santana should have his a#% sued for the hard ships these people have went through in having to redo there entire computers systems, or even ruining them. A true artist doesnt care how his or her music gets out there, or how much it sells, they care about the fans and how much THEY enjoy it, but as i've seen and read Santana is about the biggest jerk in music today, and very self-centered. As you listen to this album listen to every song, and you'll here this, \\"YEAH SANTANA's IN THE HOUSE\\", \\"YEAH BABY CARLOS SANTANA ON THE GUITAR MAN\\", \\"BRINGIN IT DOWN WITH MR CARLOS SANTANA, NO S#%#!!! its a Santana album, we are all aware of this by the title!! Guess he needs that reassurance. Anyways, get music the way you feel you should, buy it, download it, copy it off the radio, friends whatever, in my opinion music should be free, and entertainers are paid way to much for what they do, but hey thats just me, i'm a music lover, not a money GRUBBER. LATER...............KEEP ON KEEPIN ON FOLKS. P.s isnt it funny that KIRK HAMMETT is on this album, boy must be nice to band together all the selfish, narcisisitc, money hording musicians out there.:)
B000777J2S|4.0|Warning:  If you have a strong aversion to men who sing in a high, quivering falsetto, or if you are generally considered a hard rockin' homophobe; this album IS NOT FOR YOU.  Try the latest \\"Almost Greatest Hits\\" compilation by Lynard Skinnard. <br /> <br />However, if you are possessed of an open, inquiring mind - one that embraces beauty, intelligence and artistic expression - a mind that can rise above all the stupid labels and pidgeonholes our society is so fond of applying to anyone they can't fathom, then try this out. <br /> <br />I had no idea what I was getting into when I purchased Bird Gurl after reading a couple of rave reviews on Indy Websites. God knows the cover art alone would be off-putting to almost anyone uncomfortable with any sort of gender-bending (Hmmm, guess that means about 92% of Americans), let alone any  overcompensating, monster truck-driving NASCAR nitwit with a pair of naked girl mudflaps (I think thou dost protest too much sir!) The  photo of Candy Darling on the album cover gives me a melancholy feeling, and makes me think of what a child born of the union of Tim Curry and Marlene Dietrich might look like.   <br /> <br />But getting back to the music; it is completely ETHEREAL.  I have never heard, much less imagined, that such a synthesis of human voice and musical instruments could produce such a heavenly choir. <br /> <br />Antony has an amazing voice, and it sounds lovely to me regardless of the words he's singing; even the saddest songs offer tremendous insight into what it is like to be human, to love, to fear, to face change, to feel different from the rest of the world.  The lyrics reflect Antony's understanding of both the necessity for change and the attendant fear that comes with it.  The songs combine his thought-provoking lyrics with his strange, angelic voice to produce a recording of incredible depth and beauty. <br /> <br />Instrumentally speaking, the songs are stripped down to just a few powerful supporting cast members:  There  is an emphasis on piano, with some violin, viola, cello, sax, and flute. With the celestial sound of Antony's voice, and the beautifully arranged music, the songs could almost be chamber music for an audience of the dearly departed..  <br /> <br />I don't know what the rest of the world thinks about this strange and wonderful music, but to me it's absolutely beautiful. <br />
B00000K2W1|5.0|She was Super Star of my time as crazy hippie &  still a super star now. Great voice of angel,Janis, love & missed her now so much.

She was the blue & man she could sing the blues. Where are you 1969 ....

B000BOH8XW|5.0|Hi!. In spite of what other people think, I've found \\"oral fixation vol.2\\" very attractive and delicious. Even because of this one, I started to like the Vol. 1, which I used to think was \\"crap\\". But hey, Shakira has come to surprise me again. <br /> <br />\\"How Do You Do?\\" is a very strong and rock track with a religious touch, very nice and truth about questions you'd like to ask God. \\"Don't Bother\\" the first single is simply good, an unappreciated quality song. \\"Illegal\\" is nice, Santana makes the same thing he always does with his guitar but the lyrics are catchy and they go straight to the heart. \\"The Day and the Time\\" with Gustavo Cerati in the background chorus are great, this one made me like the spanish one named \\"dia especial (special day)\\". \\"Animal City\\" is very cool with so many different rhythms and animal sounds, is cool. \\"Dreams for Plans\\" is a kind-of-ballad song that makes you remember all the things you've lost in your life. \\"Hey You\\" is the perfect song to dedicate to that one you love and then comes \\"Your Embrace\\" to make the 'I love you and I need you' package complete. \\"Costume Makes the Clown\\" is definitely one of the most boring songs of the album, because of the lyrics, the music is phenomenal. \\"Something\\", the english version of \\"en tus pupilas\\" is even better than the spanish one, the lyrics and everything, really touching, and the last song \\"Timor\\" is maybe one of my favourites of this album, the lyrics aren't that \\"deep\\" but what it says is truth. <br /> <br />If you're planning to buy a CD, this one is your perfect choice [if you like good quality music], but I recommend you to wait to March 28 when the Re-edition is gonna be out with the new song \\"Hips Don't Lie (featuring Wyclef Jean)\\", which is a very good track, very \\"danceable\\" (even tho' it will not \\"match\\" with the quality and genre of the other songs) and probably it will include a DVD or remixes, it'll be great. <br /> <br />BUY IT!
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Might contain a few spoilers! <br /> <br />\\"Lost in Translation\\" is a film about two strangers who meet and form an unlikely bound and friendship. The film's stars are played by comic genius Bill Murray (Bob Harris) and the charismatic rising young actress Scarlett Johansson (Charlotte). Bob is a washed up actor who was once a famed celebrity, but now he's stuck doing commercials in various places, for the film he's sent to Japan (he seems to be famous there). Bob is pretty much bored the moment he arrives in Tokyo, he has nothing in common with anyone, thus doesn't talk much. He does however have several humorous encounters with citizens, which never end well thanks to the language barrier. Charlotte on the other hand, is a recently married young woman who's accompanying her photographer husband on a work related trip, which happens to be Tokyo, Japan. She like Bob is also bored in this new foreign environment and she spends most of her time moping around the hotel bedroom. All this changes though with the eventual meet between Bob and Charlotte where they click right away. Despite the age gap they seem to get along and understand each other. They are both American after all. Thus, both Charlotte and Bob spend the rest of the film exploring the city visiting strip clubs, dance clubs and bars. Their excursions have a positive effect on them since they learn to appreciate the Japanese city life and for moments they forget about all their problems. <br /> <br />I thought the film was Okay nothing special or great to write home about. With the universal acclaim the film received I expected a laugh out loud comedy; the film only manages to make us grin and chuckle a few times, but nothing really to make us consider it a comedy, so the film did disappoint me.(the film explores human loneliness and boredom). I thought it was too subtle; I agree it makes the two lead performances feel extremely real, but that wasn't enough to save the film. The two leads are miserable andlonely characters whose desperation and misery brings them together. They have long conversations about their life and try to figure out who they really are and the meaning of everything in their lives (from what I remember since I can't remember much from this forgettable film). It sounds good on paper not on film, why bore us showing the boredom the lead characters are going through? Might have been better with a bit more melodrama to spice things up. <br /> <br />Furthermore, You'd think the intellectual and mature dialogue the film offers would be a plus, but its not considering the fact that the conversations are not remotely intriguing, so they did not capture my attention (in many scenes). Although, the film does offer things of interest such as the cinematography and the leads subtle performances and chemistry. The cinematography was quite amazing and it in no way made the film seem low budget, which it was with a production budget of 4 million (looks more expensive). The performances were also great. As I already mentioned they were subtle, so they felt real and natural. While watching Bill and Scarlett on screen they made you forget you were observing actors perform they truly became their characters. I felt like I was viewing a documentary about two people's long friendship. Bill and Scarlett's characters might have just met, but their on screen chemistry really makes you believe they've been friends for a very long time. With the performances realism I ended up caring for them, I felt sympathy for them. I also loved the last good bye between Bob and Charlotte, it was moving and heartbreaking, I empathized with them watching their sad facial expressions. <br /> <br />The film had a lot to offer especially the performances, gorgeous cinematography and the leads enchanting chemistry, but in the end I didn't feel completely satisfied; it lacked excitement and life (too gloomy). Not a bad film, but not exactly a good one either, although the strong performances and chemistry of the leads almost made me like the film.
B000BYA5G4|2.0|How could a movie about an international arms merchant have virtually no action.????   Nicolas Cage's performance was fine but the movie was too slow moving for my taste.  Downright boring at times.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|Might Contain a few spoilers! <br /> <br />As you could have guessed the film is about a disfigured musical genius known as the Phantom that hides in a French Opera house. Though he does not come in contact with many people, he loves to terrorize the group of singers and performers who perform there every night. The Phantom while eccentric and crazy at times does have a talent and it's music, which he uses to tutor a young soprano chorus girl, who he falls in love with over time. The Phantom eventually decides his precious Christine should get the lead of the Opera's main show, so he drives the actual star (Carlotta) out of the Opera house with threats and attempts against her life. Christine is finally given the title role and she wows the audience with her voice, but Jealous Carlotta afraid of losing the attention returns to claim back the role. With Carlotta's return, the Phantom only causes more chaos and havoc he even ends up committing murder. Christine is horrified by all these acts; and she manages to find support in a young man named Raoul with whom she falls in love with. The Phantom enraged with this new event kidnaps Christine in hopes of keeping her by his side forever. I'll stop here, if you really want to know what happens I suggest watching the film. <br /> <br />One of the great things the film has to offer is the beautiful and eye-catching visuals, which are truly amazing. Although, the lavish scenery might be too stunning for it's own good since it can become quite distracting. While, you're admiring the elaborate costumes, set-design and cinematography you might miss some important aspects of the film and story. Other things to admire are the exceptional performances especially from Emmy Rossum (plays Christine) the revelation of the year and Gerard Butler (plays Phantom). Emmy exudes such beauty and innocence; that you can't resist liking her. I was also surprised by her astonishing vocals, she actually sings better than many of today's musicians. Gerard Butler's voice was also a surprise since I heard so many people say his atrocious singing had ruined the film. Now his voice wasn't spectacular, but it worked, it was rough, powerful and passionate. You can tell he tried his best since he put a lot of emotion into his singing (he was able to convince us of his great love and obsession for Christine) and might I add that he looked great as the Phantom, I really can't imagine anyone else for the role after viewing the film. Also, the last 50 minutes of the film were quite good since it became fast paced, entertaining and more action filled. The final piece of the film I enjoyed were three songs in particular. I really liked \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" especially it's haunting melody and I also enjoyed the sweet and sorrowful, \\"Think of Me\\" and \\"Angel of Music\\". <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I hated quite a few things about the film. I wasn't particularly fond of most of the music and songs. It was missing catchy and fun music like \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" and the entertaining upbeat songs like \\"Chicago\\". I also thought the lack of spoken dialogue throughout the film really dragged it and it became annoying at some points listening to song after song without any breaks for long periods of time. I would have liked a nice balance of singing and spoken dialogue much like \\"West Side Story\\", \\"Chicago\\" and \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" managed to work with. The last thing I despised was Minnie Driver's (who plays Carlotta) performance. It was extremely annoying and I understand her character is supposed to be annoying, but I felt like she went overboard. Seriously, every time she opened her mouth I wanted someone to slap her. But it doesn't stop there she also had an atrocious strong accent, which at times made it difficult to understand what she was saying, and don't even get me started on her vocal performance. Minnie singing voice was dubbed, but the person who provided her vocals was excruciating to listen to. <br /> <br />That pretty much sums up what I thought of the film. I didn't think it was good, but it wasn't a bad film either. I could see myself watching it again if I had nothing better to do or watch on TV.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Please if you really love Brokeback Mountain - like me - and this absolutely fabulous CD buy also 'Red Dirt Girl' CD by Emmylou Harris. Her 2000 CD it's a fantastic piece that you could enjoy listen too - along with this score. Emmylou Harris, Willie Nelson, Teddy Thompson and Rufus Wainwright are definitely in tune with the Brokeback Mountain unforgettable movie! I only wish that this soundtrack were a little longer with more Gustavo's music.    Hope that real soon the full soundtrack/score will be available with the complete 22 tracks. The now famous 7 tracks from this CD + the 15 new ones by Gustavo.    That said - once and for all - Brokeback Mountain is glorious in all its aspects.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Jesus, this album is so affecting, I'm literally astounded to the extreme...hell, it's so beautifully put together.  I'm hesitant to even open the case incase I scratch the case, how strange is that.  Listening to it at the moment, I marvel at it's ability to transport you right back into the movie in a series of memories, so relentless it's both deeply satisfying and yet devastating.   <br />  If you were changed, or moved by the film this isn't merely a want, it's a necessity.  I had left the cinema reeling, upset, determined and still aching weeks afterwards.  I needed a reminder of the movie to relieve me, heard about the soundtracks's release, so I took a day off and bought it from a store in London.  God, did I feel better.  Never have I felt such a relief.   <br />  If you've read Annie Proulx's short story, and watched the film, you might know what I mean - provoking, capable of awakening, stirring and inject one with such determination.  Now, that's what I call emotionally charged...
B00005JOII|5.0|Woody Allen has made quite a turn with Match Point.  The film is a change from the humor and the landscape that moviegoers have grown accustomed to - the New York state of mind.  This time it is the English landscape with a bit of London haze.  Indeed, Match Point possesses elements of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller, and a little bit romantic entanglement that one would see on a daytime soap opera.  However, the most interesting part of the film is the core theme of wealth and prestige, and the cultural aesthetics that go along with it - the game of tennis and a rich taste for the arts.<br /><br />Match Point involves the story of Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and his rise from a tennis instructor to a top-notch stock market executive.  During the beginning of the film Chris appears to be the well-rounded good guy who is supportive of his friends.  He falls for and marries his tennis client's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer).  However, under that good guy exterior, being married is not enough.  Chris becomes bored and flirts with his brother-in-law's fiancee, Nola (Scarlet Johannson).  Months later, Nola and Tom (Matthew Goode) break off their engagement, and Nola is now single.  Chris continues his spare time pursuits toward Nola while still being married to Chloe.  The situation gets sticky, and Chris has to find a way to resolve the Nola situation.  Chris tells Nola that he will find a way to tell Chloe about the two of them.  Weeks pass, and nothing happens.  Chris lies about everything.  The tension builds, and he confides with no one.  He eventually resolves the situation on his own with gruesome results.  Indeed, wealth and prestige goes to Chris' head in order to get what he wants.<br /><br />Woody Allen produces a meticulous film that ends with a clean finish.  The screenplay and the production are excellent, and Allen probably takes from literary master Dostoevsky in shaping the character of Chris.  The sound track is impeccable.  Instead of old jazz or pop standards that usual covet the background music of a Woody Allen film, one distinguishable vintage operatic piece as well as others accompanies intense moments in the film.  There are no cinematic feats, but that should not prevent anyone from watching a different Wood Allen film.<br /><br />Overall, the film is recommended for those who like a little suspense in a movie.  The film is a little lengthy, but the enticing plotline will make up for the time.al covet the background music of a Woody Allen film, one distinguishable vintage operatic piece as well as others accompanies intense moments in the film.

B00007KWHG|5.0|Among 60s supergroups, The Four Seasons were something of an anomaly, their sound being very much of the 50s, clearly influenced by The Four Freshmen.  In fact, Valli had been singing for a decade by the time of their first hit, in 1962, and he and his backing lineup had already gone though a number of name changes.  There had also been changes of personnel and it was the arrival of Bob Gaudio in that year that changed everything.  He penned Sherry, their breakthrough hit, and was writer or co-writer of most of the subsequent hits.  In that youth-obsessed age, promoters were nervous of the fact that Valli was 28 (married with two kids, to boot) and the other Seasons were in their mid-thirties.  So they lopped a few years off.  The insert notes in this CD repeat the official line that Valli was born in 1937.  It was actually 1934.  In those days, it mattered.  Watch a Stones concert today and marvel at how things have changed.<br /><br />In the late 60s and into the 70s, their style changed, taking on R&B and disco elements, and Valli dropping his trademark falsetto.  This is the best period, with 1975's Oh, What a Night as their classic.<br /><br />The Anthology double CD has more tracks and is great value, but this album of remastered tracks of their biggest hits sounds better and will suit most listeners.  Its span is just right, starting with Sherry and ending with Grease, and it includes 4 of Valli's solo efforts.<br /><br />In giving this album 5 stars I'm not saying I think it's musically excellent - there are too many notes not quite hit and too many lyrics that are a bit too cutesy for that - but I am saying it's a solid, good value, 'Best of' collection of a definitive 60s and 70s group.
B000BV7TH0|5.0|What makes this third album of the Strokes so exceptional? For sure is the most sophisticated of all three.  Also is the one that puts them in the list of the remarkable rock bands of the decade for using the cool sounds combined with Julian Casablanca's characteristic voice in an amazing result. It is really hard to describe the real cause for the feeling of optimism you get after listening to it but you will realize that this group is able to give much  more in the future.
1573225517|4.0|Like so many other books I have read lately, I ordered this one based on the advise of other amazon reviewers. Forty pages into the book, I was not sure if I made a good choice. I thought the book might be a bit shallow, and a waste of my time. The more I read, though, the more I realized that this wasn't just a slice of life story, but the bearing of someone's soul. It is a very honest account of the things that go on in a man's mind in regard to his relationships with friends, lovers, and circumstances of life. Even though on the face of things I am a very different person than the main character, I was amazed at how much we thought alike about so many things. This book does not try to paint a picture of a superhero. It, rather, paints an honest, revealing picture a real person trying hard to figure out just who he is. Once I got involved in his thoughts, I didn't want to stop reading. It's a book; buy it and enjoy it.
B00005JOFO|5.0|What a tragic drama occurred in this year 1963, when a diabolical machination managed to assassinate the President who could have opened a door and let us go through it. Imagine 1968 with Kennedy in the White House and his brother running for the election with Martin Luther King as vice-president. Ang Lee decides to show this phenomenal frustration by caressing us in teh wrong place and the wrong way, by breathing some freezing air in our neck. Two virile cowboys, who look after sheep mind you, fall in love in the solitude of these high mountains in Wyoming. What can happen ? The whole world crashes down into illusions and appearances, false sentiments that are nothing but a thin veil hiding, as well as possible, the depth that is totally forbidden and repressed and frustrated and negated lest the guardians of morality and normality decide to clean up that plate of the trash such feelings represent in their apocalyptically square vision. And the tragedy swells and waxes and explodes. Unhappiness is the result and men and women see their souls buried as deep as hell into the egostic selfishness of running after the sole satisfaction of material needs that bring no spiritual satisfaction, no pleasure of the mind, no dream of the soul, just a fattening accumulation of cholesterol and depthless enjoyment of evanescent virtual images on a TV screen. And the films finds its closure in death, death of one of those partners, and total alcoholic oblivion for the other one who satisfies himself with a tumbler of whisky to celebrate the coming wedding of one of his daughters. Pathetic regression into playing the role other people expect you to play. Where is the angel of light that should inhabit our living impulse, our libido ?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne
B000AYEL6U|5.0|For those of us with an unashamed weakness for good period dramas, the BBC's NORTH AND SOUTH satisfies on several levels, despite it's gloomy industrial leitmotif.  Since it is based on the novel by Elizabeth Gaskell, we know that it will be more genteel than the Brontes, yet still pack a Romantic, but Victorian, wallop.  It's beautifully done cinematically: the physical contrast between Northern and Southern England is stark---the former, has skies that are, cold, gray, and constantly on the verge of storm.  It is home to cotton mills whose interiors are prey to the the whirling snow of cotton fibers.  Our window into the South tends toward green fields needing mowing, yellow primroses or time in a London townhouse with a \\"bell jar\\" atmosphere.<br /><br />N & S has engaging characters we admire and come close to detesting at the same time.  Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) comes to Milton, a Northern factory town, with her father, a former vicar, who has given up his parish on a point of conscience and her mother, an invalid with an over-protective servant in tow.  Margaret casts a wary eye on life as it is lived in Milton because these rough-tongued Northerners upset her ideas of everthing from good manners to independent women.  The foremost villan of her North is John Thornton (Richard Arimtage), a factory owner who beats a factory-worker under her nose at her first meeting with him.  A close runner-up is Nicholas Higgins (Brendan Coyle), an idealistic labour leader whose rough honesty and wary hospitality humanizes him in our eyes from the start.<br /><br />What the story-line lacks in originality is made up tenfold by the fine performances of the cast previously mentioned and other notable performance by Sinead Cusack as Thornton's cold, wary, bristling mother and Anna Maxwell Mantin's turn as the aggressively air-headed daughter of the Thornton house.<br /><br />This four part (two disc) set will be something I'll view again and again in the future because it is satisfying on so many levels---the music is powerful, the political theory is irrefutable, and I defy the viewer not to be deeply moved by the last scenes in a train station. This is not to be missed.fying on so many levels---the music is powerful, the political theory is irrefutable, and I defy the viewer not to be deeply moved by the last scenes in a train station.

B000002LAB|3.0|This is Miles and Marcus Miller.  There are other musicians as well, like George Duke on one song.  It's basically Marcus setting up an 80's backing track and Miles playing over it.  Tutu and Portia are the best songs.  All in all, it just leaves me cold, there's no interaction, and Miles' tone isn't appealing.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|The movie was exciting and fascinating so I had to buy the DVD.  I don't consider myself a SciFi fanatic but this show is great.  The series should be on Tv again; it's more intelligent, witty, and exciting than almost any show on Tv now.
0316168815|4.0|I finished reading this book over a month ago but it has stayed on my mind since then.  I thought it was an interesting premise -a murdered child up in Heaven continues to monitor her family. The devestation of the family is too real and I found myself crying on more than a few occasions while reading. But not to give the wrong impression, the book is not all gloomy & morose, it is thought provoking and as I already mentioned, very interesting.<br /><br />The only beef I had was with a surreal passage near the end - those who've read it know what I'm talking about...I had to re-read this section 3 times  since it detracted from the otherwise excellent \\"flow\\" of the story.  I mean, it'd be a good movie special effects portion but in a book setting, it was distracting & strange. Overall though, I'd highly recommend this book.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Music soundtracks can be adequate, jarring, annoying, or, on rare occasions, exactly right.  As in the case of \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou,\\" the music for \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is perfectly suited for the setting, the period, and the emotional rollercoaster journey.  It is stark, haunting, evocative, and memorable.  The film is a gut-wrenching experience.  The artists and their work in this album deserve our admiration and congratulations for doing justice to the piece and honoring the its creators.
B00003CXDB|5.0|Ten stars.  That simple.  Between a flawless performance by Douglas and the advisory/cameo role of Jeff Beck, this movie backfired on Stone.  Its brilliance is as much in its apparent insight into \\"80s greed\\" as it is inspiration for everyone who firmly believes that one Ferrari is simply not enough.  Virtually every line of this Oscar-winning masterpiece should be committed to memory, not for it purported value as a parable re: capitalism gone bad but as an arrow in one's quiver for daily conversation.  \\"I create nothing; I own.\\"
0553573411|3.0|The first book in the Farseer series, \\"Assassin's Apprentice,\\" was, I thought, almost groundbreaking.  It was moving, psychologically complex, fast-paced and exciting.  \\"Royal Assassin\\" is a well-told tale, still psychologically interesting and relatively fast-paced, but lacking some of the complexity evident in the first book.  And the ending is pretty disappointing and more than a little predictable. <br /> <br />Still, definitely worth reading. <br /> <br />
0684171600|5.0|This was one of my favorites when I was young. I remember reading it over and over again, and even when I wasn't reading it, I would take the book down and look at the wonderful illustrations in it, and be enthralled. I remember that when I got into college, one of the first things I did was write an essay for one of those intro to college courses in which I claimed that I was going to be a pirate when I grew up (I got an A), and of course, the essay was inspired by Treasure Island. I owe so much, including my bright future to this book... <br /> <br />Anyway, about a decade after having read it last, I picked this little novel back up. It wasn't as long as I remembered it. And I started to read. And it grabbed me just as much as it had years ago. From the beginning, Stevenson's got you. It's easy to relate with Jim, and the cast of characters still doesn't fail to entertain. It's difficult to imagine any character that captures the imagination quite like Long John Silver does. And of course, Captain Smollet, Captain Flint, Dr. Livesey, Ben Gunn, and all the rest are something else, too. And, of course, the plot's deservedly classic. There are the cliffhangers and other standard adventure devices, and even though they've been used everywhere else, it's still authentic here. Anyway, it's still a great read to me, and I finished it in less than a day. <br /> <br />So, it's a great book. Anybody on earth who can read would love it I'm sure. I've read a lot of adventure novels in my life, and this one is still toward the top of the list.

B00005JOFO|2.0|After reading most of the reviews for Brokeback Mountain that have been posted here, I have to agree with SFDesigner and a few others.  I wanted to like this movie, I wouldn't go see a movie that I wasn't interested in. Most of the characters were forgetable for the most part. That isn't a negative thing. They just weren't very intersting and in a movie the characters have to be interesting in order for the audience to care about them. In my opinion, people are praising this movie more for it's ground breaking theme (rightfully so, I must say) than for the actual content. If these two characters where a \\"normal\\" couple I believe that the movie would be considered run of the mill if not plain bad. I just wanted more character development. Tell me why these guys fell in love. Was it just because the spent a couple of months hearding sheep? Why fall in love with each other? Why didn't they fall for other guys in the past? I know that we have to suspend disbelief when we watch movies but still...
B00005JOFO|5.0|Having read the original short story by Proulx a few years ago, I was surprised by how well a tale of love between two cowboys set against a panaromic Wyoming backdrop was told. When I learned that the 60-page short story would become a film directed by celebrated director Lee Ang, I hoped it would be made soon.<br /><br />By now, most people would have associated Brokeback Mountain with gay forbidden love. The truth is, Brokeback Mountain is just a very simple tale of arduous love and anyone with an ounce of emotion should watch.<br /><br />The union of director Lee Ang, scriptwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, and the cast results in one of the most exquisite and endearing films made in the last few years.<br /><br />Lee Ang possesses the talent for slow, intricate and subtle film direction. He pays attention to almost every aspect from simple small gestures to complex emotional strifes set against the magnificent mountain view.<br /><br />McMurtry and Ossana also adapted the story faithfully except for the fact that the two male leads were originally much less desirable than Ledger and Gyllenhaal with bucked-tooth and stocky bodies.<br /><br />The assembled cast is the third link which leads the film to flight. Heath Ledger, the stoic straight-man type is caught unexpectedly in a tangled web of emotions for a fellow cowboy, something that had never crossed his less-than-queer mind. A man of few words, Ledger plays Ennis to perfection when he displays the inner turmoil that Ennis enountered trying to live his life the way it is and learning to love Jack. Every time Ledger breaks down and cries in the film, it's when you'll feel him.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is the hopeful companion who prays for the day that the union could yield the type of permanence he so craved for instead of \\"a couple of high-altitude fs once or twice in a year.\\" And he waited for 20 years until the audience shares his anguish and unfulfilled yearnings by the time he lashed out on what they ever have left is Brokeback Mountain.<br /><br />Michelle Williams plays the silent, long-suffering wife who witnessed the earth-shattering and ultimately heartbreaking kiss shared between Ennis and Jack after 4 years of separation. Williams is exceptionally sorrowful, swallowing her unspoken hurt until she could hold it no more that she wanted to hear the truth out of Ennis' mouth years after her remarriage. Williams' acting powress is certainly validated by the expression she showed at the instance of that unexpected kiss and the heartwrenching exchange with Ledger.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway plays a rich girl whose expertise is in making money not relationships. Given her short screentime, her change from a brash rich rodeo queen to a high-society career woman and finally a emotionless and grieving widow expands her acting abilities beyond her impish Princess Diary-self.<br /><br />Many unions, liasions and break-ups later, Brokeback Mountain emerges as a tragic yet bittersweet and endearing tale of love between four suffering people afflicted with varying degrees of attachment but all not willing to let go. To me, this suffices as more than a gay cowboy story. To enjoy Brokeback Mountain, an open mind and eyes are definitely pre-requisites.

B0000028VT|5.0|As a young kiddo I always thought Mariah Carey was one of the worst and most overrated musicians ever and one day I decided to listen to the music box album... <br />The first song dreamlover was instantly ... BANG! Whoa I like this? Their is something remarkable on her voice; it's like some sort of soft screaming (I never heard that anywhere else), just listen to this song and you'll hear those short high-pitched vocal parts I'm talking about. The second song is just like a fairy tale, just like the title suggests 'hero', you almost feel the hug a princess is giving to the hero. Very emotional like all the rest of the album, and when I'm speaking of emotions I can't deny the purity and effectiveness of the third song: 'anytime you need a friend'. This song really blew me away, the first time I heard it I shivered! I cried! Songs like 'I've been thinking about you' and 'now that I know' are much more disco and therefore giving the listener the opportunity to dry his tears for a minute. Although they are the only \\"faster\\" songs, everything else is 'balladesque', but what kind of ballads! <br />'Without you' is just another brilliant classic, a million people must have slowed on this one on a wedding or some sort of \\"chique\\" occasion. <br />And don't forget the title track! It starts with a real music box ( together with the contrabass the most beautiful instrument on the earth :-p) <br />HAIL MARIAH CAREY!  <br /> <br />
B00000JR2A|4.0|Great arrangements and production abound here.  \\"Sowing The Seeds of Love\\" is a great song (one of the best of the 80's) and is a take-off of the Beatles during their St. Pepper's days (trippy).  The great Oleta Adams is stunning on \\"Woman In Chains\\" and \\"Badman's Song\\". <br />The good thing is that this still sounds great today. An impressive album.
B0000640SB|5.0|This movie is great. It follows two anti-alien fighters who are trying to stop a menace of cockroach beings, one of which is in disguise of a man, but still disgusting looking. If he wins, the world belongs to space cockroaches. Can the alien killers, known as the Men In Black, kill this evildoer and all his alien cockroach friends? Find out by watching this cool movie, full of intense fighting, a lot of very funny scenes(much funnier than those with Jar Jar Binks, which were only funny because I hate him so and the scenes showed what I pee on he was. I HATE JAR JAR!)all sorts of interesting plots and even a cute/lovable cat that helps the fight, believe it or not. You want cool and funny? This is cool and funny! All those who like action and comedy need to see it now! Nuff said!
0895260131|3.0|Even though Spencer allows us to view of the topic of his book with the black colored glasses that he has put on and we are not able to see any other shades, this book is given 3 stars for the author being successful in his mission, i.e. invite others to his way of thinking about a particular group of people. <br /> <br />In his quest of convincing others about the dangers posed by the adherents of Islam and possibly threatening the many freedoms we now enjoy, Spencer could have referred to another book published not too long ago titled Mein Kampf in which the author exercised his judgment more reasonably than Spencer in his attempt to win an ideological war against the evils threatening society and those who are responsible for the evil or their ideology or religion. <br /> <br />In regards to fairness and credibility, based on the reports provided about the messages being conveyed by Osama Bin Laden, I would expect him to be more credible if he writes a book titled \\"All you Need to Know About the Bush Dynasty\\". <br /> <br />Spencer's book could become the most conspicuous book in every home or institution in the western societies, as Mein Kampf was the most conspicuous book in most non-Jewish German homes or institutions in the 1930's, only Spencer has gone more overboard than the author of Mein Kampf in his ridiculousness and blatant hatred of an ideology/religion/or group of people he does not agree with. <br /> <br />Spencer attempts to present a convincing case for rationalizing ill treatment of those who are born into or choose the religion of Islam. It is up to the jury or the reader to decide whether to be convinced of the argument as put forth by Spencer, or to recognize that that he has been distorting any issue possible to convince the jury to believe his case. <br /> <br />Spencer does deserve credit for some civility as I was expecting him to provide details about the Final Solution to solve the problem of Islam and muslims threatening our way of life.I look forward  to Spencer's next book on details about the final Solution which he is probably in the process of finalizing at this time, or will it be that as the aiuthor of Mein Kampf provided the guidance, it will be easier for someone else to come up with the Final Solution
B00005JKZ3|5.0|This movie is so cool and funny! It's even better than the first of the MIB movies! It follows an alien named Serleena who takes on the form of Lara Flynn Boyle. She's on Earth because she wants a light device that will help her planet and race thrive. Soon, she finds some victims to get information out of, but it's to no avail. Meanwhile, our returning MIB heroes are still looking out for more evil space scum and soon after offing a whole lot of it run into Serleena and some of her minions. The fights happen and soon Serleena herself is the only one left. Ultimately, she makes one last attempt to achieve her goal before being blasted to bits by Will Smith. This movie is funnier than the first, cooler than the first and it brings back memories of good times in my past. You liked the first Men In Black movie? See this one with no delays or hesitations.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Watching the previews for this movie, it didn't do much for me.  So I never went to see it in theatres.  Boy did I miss out!  So, going through Blockbuster one day, I decided to get it out of sheer curiosity.  Besides, if it was bad, it was only $6 wasted, right?   <br />I went out and bought the movie the next day. <br />This movie was SO much  more than I expected. <br />The humour, despite what some people have come to expect from 'comedy' movies, isn't blatant slapstick humour.  Some of it is very subtle.  And the whole movie is peppered with subtle jokes, along with the more obvious ones.  I prefer this type of intelligent humuor over some of the other stuff. <br />And there is more than just humour.  Never before in a movie have I laughed so hard, then cried, then laughed, then cried.  Very well done. <br />The acting?  Superb.  Simon Pegg does a bang up job as Shaun, the dead-beat going through the worst day in his sad little life.   <br />WOrth the money?  Heck yeah.

B000BYA5G4|2.0|Many reviewers have commented thus far how Cage excellently portrays a sociopathic international arms dealer. This is true: his performance is good, but his above average acting (above his average) does not offset a highly flawed picture. <br /> <br />1. STORYLINE - Not bad at all, but at times it is absolutely absurd and really has to beg the viewer to take it seriously. Interpol apparently can just zip into whatever country they please and make arrests. Yuri's brother's coke addiction is a worthless sub-story that could have been left out. However, the overall depiction of the violence in West Africa is pretty realistic, right down to the crazed gunmen and Cowboy cheerleader outfits. <br /> <br />2. MESSAGE - far from ambiguious. The general message is guns = violence. Just ignore it, because its not well argued anyway. <br /> <br />3. ACTING - unfortunately, the acting cannot be ignored. Cage is not a great actor, but he isn't bad in this. The actor who plays his brother is awful - evidently, they just needed a stock pretty boy actor. Ethan Hawke plays a blowhard tough Interpol cop, a role in which he is not very convincing. The Liberian warlord Baptiste is perhaps the most interesting role and most admirably performed. <br /> <br />4. WRITING - my biggest beef, and my biggest beef with most movies. The dialog is terrible, chock full of cheesy one-liners and metaphors about arms dealing. I don't object to profanity in movies, but the gratuitous use of the f-bomb makes the whole movie sound like it was written by a public-school educated 7th grader. It was rather excruciating to watch in this regard.
6305428050|1.0|It might not be a bad movie but the start is so slow that you're bored out of your mind before anything funny happens, and when it does you're not in the mood for it anyway.
0425098478|4.0|I liked this book and it's easy to read style. However I highly recommend purchasing (from Amazon of course) \\"The Art of Giving and Receiving Feedback\\" by Shirley Poertner, Karen Massetti Miller. I combined the info from the 2 books to give myself a complete system of \\"reinforcement\\" and \\"redirection\\" to use (I dislike Blanchard's use of the term reprimand; sounds too harsh and punishment-like). It takes the process a step further than Blanchard by showing what to do if after a \\"reprimand\\" the employee gives resistance or is confused about the expectations. I highly recommend Blanchard's \\"Situational Leadership and the One Minute Manager\\". The situational leadership system made my \\"lightbulb\\" come on.  <br />I am now ready to be the manager I was hoping to learn to be when I first purchased the One Minute Manager book!
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|First, I am shocked at how positive the reviews have been for this film. Second, I found that the film had two most egregious errors that changed the heart and character of the book:  <br />First is the elimination of the Pemberly scene where Elizabeth sees the change in temparment of Darcy from proud to friendly and charming.  This with the letter is her true change in heart.  The movie makes the love seem more of an obligation for saving Lydia than having solidified prior to the incident. <br />Second is the hack job of dialog making everything explicit.  What is wonderful about Austen is a comedy of subtle manners.  The minute Charlotte Lucas starts yelling at Lizzie, I realized that the spirit and charm of Austen had been lost.  This movie was a complete waste of time.
0671449028|5.0|We love and own a LOT of Sandra Boynton's books. The Going-To-Bed Book is a wonderful addition to our night time routine. The book shares nightime routines of the characters with silly pictures and wonderful rymes. The story starts out upbeat but ends on a calm note. We read three books before bedtime and our daughter always chooses The Going-To-Bed Book as one. <br /> Our daughter loves books and Sandra Boynton really seems to be all our favorites. The books are just a lot of fun. They never get old or boring. <br /> You can begin reading to your child at any age (even in the womb). Sandra Boynton's books are a MUST for any home!
0767020308|5.0|This screen adaptation of Emma captures the characters of Jane Austen's novel as I saw them, when I read the book, but it is not as slow moving and drab as the BBC's earlier versions.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|I just saw this in a movie theatre donated for a group of high school students who were raising funds for brain tumor research in Phoenix.  They showed a few minutes of George's concert for Bangadesh and then started with Eric Clapton singing a song from the Bangadesh concert.  I have just ordered this from Amazon and cannot wait to see the additional footage.  It is an awesome concert and my favorite moment was when Paul McCartney stepped to the mike to report that George's wife said about her son--\\"its looks like George is still here and all the rest of you have gotten old!\\".  I agree with previous reviewers that one of the best editing jobs of a concert that I have ever seen.  You felt like you were sitting center stage and could catch every little nuance of each person's performance and all their reactions to each others' performances.<br /><br />This is a once in a lifetime concert, not to be missed!
B000AXRTPQ|5.0|While she focuses on the working woman, this book can be applied to any working parent's life. It is  so hard to juggle between home and work...and have enough emotional energy to handle them both as well. I am hardly a top execitive  like the author was portrayed as, but it doesn't matter what career you have...if  it is something other than parenthood, this book helps you feel like someone out there understands! There was a lot of humor, but there were also many moments where I just wanted to cry at the overwhelming empathy of all the little moments that I love about being the mom of a 14 month old. When she hears her son calling for his \\"Roo\\" (a lovey that goes missing) I could almost hear my daughter simultaneously making a similar sound of \\"Boo\\" when she desparately wants you to read one of her books. Her near infidelity almost crosses the line, but ends up right where it should be in the end. It adds a sexy touch! Highly recommended!

I now emerge from four months of reading and intensive cross study with a WELL MARKED copy of this book and a better understanding of our great nation than ever before.  I am already anticipating re-reading certain portions in order to use them in teaching. <br /> <br />More than anything this book has helped me to reawaken a passion for history, learning and understanding.  Mr. Johnson's unique voice has become that of an old and wise friend that calls us to take back up the moral imperative that has made this country great. <br /> <br />I recommend this book very highly, especially to teachers, ministers, parents and anyone else who has a part in shaping the minds of others.

0670034711|5.0|This book (somehow memoir doesn't seem to do justice to what Gilbert has produced) will make you silent in realizing profound and great wisdom before making you blurt sudden laughter upon reading the very next page.  Everything that a full human life has...it is all here: the rough, tough, and heart-breaking mixed alongside the soaring, transcending heights of joy and love.  But it isn't merely a neat packaging of a complex life that will make you feel privileged to witness.  This book is a gift calling you to actively seek out a fuller life for your own self--not in some self-help way--but by offering keys to (often subtle) realizations about what your own life is and could be.  It is Gilbert's telling of her journey with such open truth and unfailing sincerity that calls you to look with clarity at yourself and not just be a bystander to her or your own life.  Because Gilbert shares so deeply, it is a book that you will read and then instantly share with another.   <br />IN SHORT: In this poignant account of one woman's journey, you ultimately feel connected not only to the people that populate the pages, but also to the larger workings of your own life and the universe.

B000099T2L|1.0|After the superb first single, \\"Crazy In Love\\", you'd be forgiven for thinking that this Beyonce album was going to be something a bit special. Instead, what you actually get is that brilliant track and 14 duds.<br /><br />It probably wasn't a good idea putting \\"Crazy In Love\\" as the first track, because it really soars, high above any other pop song that year, but the comedown back to earth is slow and painful. From the dire collaboration with nonsense peddler Sean Paul to the boring ballad \\"Me Myself And I\\" (an answer to who actually LIKES the rest of the album, maybe?) the urge to skip back to track one gets harder and harder with every sub-par ballad (and there's a LOT of them) and mawkish, glassy-eyed Christian \\"I love you, God\\" rubbish.<br /><br />If Beyonce was wanting to distance herself from Destiny's Child, then maybe she did just that. I'm no expert on them, but surely the other girls (Horse-Face and Other One) would have rejected about 90% of this album as nothing but filler. But then again, I have HEARD the rest of Destiny's Child's \\"Survivor\\" album, so maybe not.<br /><br />Beyonce is, creatively speaking at least (her stuff sells by the ton, admittedly) in trouble. \\"Crazy In Love\\" could well be an unbeatable effort on her behalf, that one song she'll just never better - especially if her most recent effort (\\"Check On It\\" from the new Pink Panther film) is anything to go by.<br /><br />But that's more crap for another day, folks.<br /><br />[...]

B00070Q7VO|3.0|I decided to check out Michael Buble's album \\"It's Time\\" to see what all the fuzz about him was about. No matter how many times I heard the album: what I found was a young Canadian artist singing 13 standards rearranged to fit into a big band feel. Buble's singing was above average, but the abundant comparisons to Frank Sinatra are frankly an overstatement. For the most part, it is the arrangements by legendary producer David Foster that truly carry the weight in the album, including the surprising jazz version of The Beatles' \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\". Overall, the album deserves three stars, not more. If you want to listen to some recent amazing singing of standars, I would instead recommend \\"Songs from the Last Century\\" by George Michael, released in 1999.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This is such a good mini-series to see that it is worth purchasing either a DVD or Video version of this film.  I read the book, and was somewhat reluctant to purchase and view the film.  Spielberg and Hanks do a great job in recreating the setting of that time.  Not only is the horror of war recreated, but the men's relations with each other develops.  When you face danger, you need to rely on the man in your platoon/battalion.  That need is shown throughout the book.  Good leadership such as that shown by Winters made these men what they became.  The book is a great example of the comradeship in war, but the film is a close second.  For those of you who view the film, read the book and vice versa.  The film and book are five stars.<br /><br />I usually don't watch many films or television, but I made an exception with Band of Brothers.  It is a great film on an even better book.  At the end of the film are some interviews with 506 PIR survivors, and this is very touching.  These men suffered so much for their country.  This was as good as the film itself.
0380002930|5.0|For some reason I always thought that watership down was the story of a sinking ship and how its passengers were rescued.  Boy was I surprised, wonderfully surprised.  The more I read the more I wanted to find out what would happen next.  I had a little trouble at first with some of the names such as Hazel for a male but that quickly passed as I became more engrossed in the book.  The book is funny, sad, happpy and mostly a testament to courage and perseverance.  I was thrilled with the group's triumphs, and saddened by their mishaps.  On some levels this may be considered a children's book but it's really for folks of all ages who love a well-told story.  This is not a book I will give away, sell, or dump in the garbage.  This one stays on my shelf to be read again and again.
0393327655|1.0|Let's take stock of where we are:  On one side, Sam Harris says there is no God.  On the other side, Moses says there is one true God. (Deut. 6:4).  Since we all know who Moses is, the question is, \\"Who is Sam Harris?\\"   <br /> <br />What nation did Harris lead out of slavery against the world's most powerful leader at the time?  Oh. . . none?  Well, when Harris gets finished with neuroscience school, maybe he can lead a nation out of captivity, give it law, a national identity, and march it toward the Promised Land.  And when that nation survives against all odds over millenia to the present, maybe Harris' opinion on what's wrong with the world will be worth something.  Until then, all those footnotes don't make Harris an expert on anything, least of all, what God can do. <br /> <br />Until then, I'm with Moses. <br /> <br />Dave Hysinger <br />San Francisco
B0007Y08I8|5.0|This movie \\"Team America\\" has really random humor, beautiful scenery, and it does not end up how you think it ends up based on your viewing of the commercials.  There are actually some sympathetic scenes in this movie.  But at first I thought this movie was going to be total and complete trash, but after I watched it, it was only 1/3 complete trash. <br /> <br />Well, first off, I think this movie is an acquired taste for most people, mainly left wingers.  This is because Alec Baldwin is the leader of the Anti-America group F.A.G.S (I can't remember what it stands for) and included in his group are Sean Penn, Susan Surandon, Tim Robbins, Danny Glover, Matt Damon, Helen Hunt, and a special \\"gut-busting\\" guest appearance by Michael Moore.  I loved it when Baldwin says \\"The world needs people who understand politics, and that is us, F.A.G.S\\".  Also, like South Park, alot of the humor is random and it contains some VERY EXPLICIT language and one VERY EXPLICIT sex scene...which is very disgusting and perverted...but still hilarious, since well, they are puppets.   <br /> <br />One thing that made me start to respect this movie was the behind the scenes portion.  It included an hour or 2 of how they built the props for this movie.  The props were beautiful, and the designers put extreme effort into making it look so real.  Even the puppets were pretty realistic, and they were 3 FEET TALL!!  Crap, I thought they were only a foot tall when I first watched it. <br /> <br />Overall, if you love South Park/Family Guy humor, this movie is for you.  And if you love your beloved country America, you will watch this movie.  EnJoY!!!! <br /> <br />John
B00005JKHP|5.0|On the surface, the plot to 1979's \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" isn't very interesting -- A colossal, mysterious space cloud called V'ger travels across the galaxy and threatens Earth; the origins of V'ger are revealed at the end. In truth, \\"The Motion Picture\\" addresses many of the deepest questions of life -- Is this all there is? Why are we here? Does love exist since it cannot be proved via pure logic? Who is the Creator? The core message is the intrinsic need to seek one's Creator and reconcile in order to attain a (necessary) higher level of consciousness. Those that hate the film and found it boring simply failed to penetrate beyond the surface.<br /><br />Like the Star Trek episodes \\"The Corbomite Maneuver\\" (#3) and \\"Metamorphosis\\" (#31), \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" is a mature, cerebral sci-fi story with very little action. Most kids and young adults won't like it or grasp it. It's depth is evidenced by the emotional wallop experienced when Spock grasps Kirk's hand in Sickbay, truly revealing emotion despite his conflicting desire to attain a consciousness of pure logic, or later when Spock weeps for V'ger and comments on its personal dilemma, which perfectly coincides with Spock's own search for fulfillment: \\"As I was when I came aboard, so is V'ger now -- empty, incomplete and searching. Logic and knowledge are not enough... Each of us at sometime in our lives turns to someone -- a father, a brother, a God -- and asks, 'Why am I here?' 'What was I meant to be?' V'ger hopes to touch its creator to find its answers.\\"<br /><br />Another powerful sequence is a crewman's self-sacrificial fusion with V'ger so that it may evolve to the next level of awareness (seemingly self-sacrificial, that is).<br /><br />The fact that the film inspires such profound contemplation and emotion proves that it's not just a bad film that apologists try to make excuses for as critics claim, e.g. \\"It's deep and awe-inspiring; you just don't understand it.\\" I'm not making excuses; it's simply the truth. If you are unable to accept this perhaps it's because YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH. (lol).<br /><br />My conclusion on the film runs parallel to Roger Ebert's comments: \\"My inclination, as I slid down in my seat and the stereo sound surrounded me, was to relax and let the movie give me a good time. I did and it did.\\" In other words, just accept the film as is, and you WILL be entertained -- but put on a pot of coffee (you're gonna need it, HA, HA!), kick back and relish the movie magic.<br /><br />Let me add that \\"The Motion Picture\\" was one of the most expensive films of its time, but it did well at the box office and thus made a decent profit -- a testimony to how hungry the public was for Star Trek after ten long years (since the cancellation of the original TV series in '69). In fact, aside from \\"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,\\" ST:TMP is still the most profitable of all the Star Trek feature films (Making FOUR TIMES its expense worldwide); it therefore can't very well be the cinematic turd that many critics claim. Also, consider the fact that ST:TMP made more at the box office than the acclaimed films \\"Alien\\" and \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" both released the same year (1979).<br /><br />I should add that, although this film is an \\"Grade A\\" picture as far as epic, awe-inspiring pieces of cinematic art go, I understand why some would grade it lower. In such cases I suggest making the necessary psychological adjustments and watching it again as it is more along the lines of \\"The Cage\\" (#1) than \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" (#35). If this doesn't work, stick with more lightweight fare like \\"Zathura\\" or even \\"Star Wars\\" (giggle). Just joking.<br /><br />The viewer will note that \\"The Motion Picture\\" is truly the sole Star Trek film that aspires to and attains a level of cinematic awe along the lines of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" Actually, \\"The Motion Picture\\" is LEAGUES better IMHO. \\"2001\\" lacks characters whom the viewer truly cares about; it's also cold and overly artsy, with way too many unnecessarily boring sequences (but, don't get me wrong, if \\"2001\\" trips your trigger, that's great). \\"The Motion Picture,\\" by contrast, has heart. Not to mention an interesting story that delves into the deepest of all universal questions.<br /><br />Say what you will, but \\"The Motion Picture\\" towers alone, utterly unique in the feature film series -- a profoundly spiritual TRIUMPH., don't get me wrong, if \\"2001\\" trips your trigger, that's great). \\"The Motion Picture,\\" by contrast, has heart. Not to mention an interesting story that delves into the deepest of all universal questions.  Say what you will, but \\"The Motion Picture\\" towers alone, utterly unique in the feature film series -- a profoundly spiritual TRIUMPH.

B000002J1U|5.0|This is Led Zeppelin's best album. <br /> <br />Of course, a month ago I would have told you their first album was their best; before that it was their second, and before that their forth. Who knows - maybe in a couple of weeks I'll finally see the light and realize that 'Physical Graffiti' was their best. The fact is that each and every one of Led Zeppelin's early albums - and mind you, they were releasing them in a pace that would make the heads of today's rock stars spin - is a classic, and an essential milestone in the development of rock music. <br /> <br />And yet - their third album may be the point where they really matured, and finally let go of their roots in the Yardbirds, as well as the first album in which they felt confident enough in their songwriting skills to include only originals rather than covers of blues standards. The blues sound that characterized the first two albums is barely even here, and instead Jimmy Page brings out his acoustic guitar and shows a remarkable sensitivity for folk and ancient musical styles, toying with harmonies and rhythms that he never used before. On Led Zeppelin III Page and co. finally master the potential they only started to explore in ballads like 'Thank You' and 'Babe I'm Gonna Leave You' and experimented more than ever before, making breakthrough results that will be the foundation of 'Stairway To Heaven' and 'The Battle Of Evermore'. <br /> <br />It's hard to notice, at first, just how important the album is, and that's why it's often underappreciated. Because the album's biggest hits, and the tracks that first grab your attention, are the electric ones, and are songs that could have easily fitted into earlier albums. 'Since I've Been Loving You' - a truly beautiful blues song, and an impressive instrumental showcase for Page, could have felt right at home on the first album, and in fact draws a lot from 'Dazed And Confused'. 'The Immigrant Song', the fast paced rocker that opens the album, is as hard and dirty as anything on Led Zeppelin II, and could have fit there perfectly (although this one, too, is more experimental and innovative than much of the material on the second album). <br /> <br />But it's on the mellower, more acoustic numbers that Led Zeppelin III really excels, and even if they're not as immediately catchy as classic rock tracks like 'Whole Lotta Love' and 'Heartbreaker', they're the album's main focus point and they get better with repeated listening. 'That's The Way' and 'Tangerine' are both remarkably beautiful ballads, and the band sounds much more at ease playing them than they did on the more strained 'Thank You'; on 'Tangerine' they sound almost remarkably the Rolling Stones at their very best. They're mellower and more comfortable here than they were before, and it shows wonderfully in the flow of these beautiful songs. On the other hand there's 'Friends' and 'Gallows Pole', which are more experimental and use harmonies Led Zeppelin never tried before; they really give Page a chance to shine as a more versatile guitarist, as does 'Celebration Day', which is an electric track which nevertheless sounds very different than anything they've done before. There's also the raw folk of 'Bron-Y-Aur Stomp' and 'Hats Off To (Roy) Harper', on which the band let go like they never have. <br /> <br />Led Zeppelin III is more of an acquired taste than any other of their albums, but it's an important part of any music collection and essential for the understanding of Led Zeppelin's contribution to music history.

0393327655|2.0|Sam Harris makes the mistake that many Western-trained philosophers make--the one where \\"reason\\" is somehow above cultural mediation. He speaks about the superiority of \\"rationality\\" and argues for \\"it\\" as if it were a unitary \\"thing\\" not unlike 3rd century (BCE) Greek philosopher, Aristotle or 17th-Century, French Enlightenment thinker, Ren&eacute; Descartes (1596-1650). What's odd is that Harris does not adequately scrutinize his own antiquated perspective nor does he \\"own\\" his own Western philosophical hermeneutical lens. He accuses religious fundamentalists of being dogmatic and blindsighted in their narrowing \\"beliefs\\" without seeing his own limited-perspective (the proverbial speck in his own fault-finding eye might in fact be a log). What's even stranger is Harris's own allegiance to \\"Eastern traditions\\" like Buddhism. He articulates a Buddhism (again as a single unit) and describes \\"it\\" as somehow less belief-oriented and more rational than say Islamic or Christian fundamentalism--and yet he does not parse out the multiple schools of Buddhist thought that reflect myriad \\"beliefs\\" in other worlds--multiple \\"hell realms\\" and \\"pure lands\\" into which one can be born/re-born if one cultivates (or neglects to cultivate) particular practices. As much as I sympathize with Harris's conviction that monotheistic fascism is terrorizing us all, I don't see his ideas defending the \\"end of faith\\" taking hold anytime soon beyond MIT and its upper-educated ilk. Fantasies of \\"rationalism\\" may make more sense to the Western-philosophically-interested, but the smells, bells, colors, music, magic, mysteries and cultural texture of the majority of traditional practices across the globe (and in his own back yard in Southern California) are unlikely to disappear anytime soon under the white/wet blanket of \\"pure reason\\"--Post-Enlightenment thinking in  multiple forms reveals the folly of one-sidedness (dualisms). Instead of getting his PhD in neuroscience, I encourage Sam to take a class--or double major, if he prefers--in cultural anthropology.-or double major, if he prefers--in cultural anthropology.
068987474X|2.0|\\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" was a little too harsh for my liking. When reading it, I felt even though it was full of little signs & signals to watch for in relationship; the way the book was written made the average woman feel ignorant for not seeing these things on her own.  I much preferred Ian Kerner's book \\"YOU'RE NOT THAT INTO HIM EITHER\\".  The author takes many different approaches to identify what kind of man you are actually dating, describes dating fatigue, looks at the definition of booty call, friends with benefits, hookup, No strings attached, etc. This book uses a \\"self-help\\" approach, instead of making the reader feel ignorant for not seeing these facts without reading a book about them.<br /><br />I know this is a very popular and well read book.  It has also had a lot of celebrity hype and media attention, sorry; it just didn't do it for me!
1400043662|5.0|\\"Kafka on the Shore\\" is my first dose of Haruki Murakami, and one that I took up on a whim. After reading some reviews here, I also thought it was worth a shot. It was a shot I certainly in no way regret.<br /><br />The first thing I would mention is the stunning array of unusual, but at the same time so real, characters. Kafka Tamura, the 15-year-old runaway, forms the main narrative, but there are major contributions from likes of Nakata, the mentally challenged elderly man who talks to cats. Perhaps the most interesting character is Oshima, but I will leave the reasons for the reader to discover. The characers were all touching some way, and all of them had real flaws, but also some real virtues. Despite their oddity, I found myself identifying with them and even sympathising with them.<br /><br />Thrown into the mix is a heady concoction of truly bizarre events that all seem to link in together. Events spread over decades of time start to intertwine as the book progresses, as the pieces fall into place. The seemingly out of this world is merely commonplace in \\"Kafka on the Shore\\", which did a lot to rattle my own frame of reference.<br /><br />In addition to the events and characters, Murakami has loaded his novel with various changes in person of the narrative. Kafka Tamura's elements are in the first person, while other characters are in the third person. Added to this, changes in the tense, and the occassional shift to second person, and you have a novel in which it is hard to get a fixed reference.<br /><br />I came away from this book having thoroughly enjoyed it to the very last page, unlike some who found the second half lacking. I must admit that I am not entirely sure why I enjoyed it so much. I have the nagging feeling that there is a whole load of meaning that I have missed, but that may be a latent sense of paranoia on my own part.<br /><br />I loved this book, and I am still mulling over what I have read in it. It is certainly a book that will keep the grey matter occuppied for some time after you have turned the last page.after you have turned the last page.

1878424114|4.0|For those of you who equate success with the accumulation of money, you may want to read this book to help you to build your spiritual foundation and be happy with your life as you build your fortune. But it is not a recipe how to get rich quickly. Nor is it a quick fix to happiness. <br /> <br />I have been reading about (Zen) Buddhism and practicing for quite a while and what struck me about this little book that it is uplifting yet very practical guide in reaching parts of `enlightment' as much this is possible for a busy professional. Chopra has the mastery to provide simple and practical guidance with seven practical steps which  you can easily integrate into your life. It is interesting to hear Chopra's views about how the World is wired together, but this is something you cannot do much with, although it gives a sense of opportunity (even if you take it with a grain of salt). I have placed Mon-Sun tabs on the practical pages and tried to put it in practice. I found that it started to seep into my normal behavior, and now I only go back every so often. <br /> <br />
0805076476|5.0|Looking for something with a bite?  An edge?  Something that titillates and entertains?  Something that provokes and challenges?<br /><br />Then look no further.  Fight Club is here.<br /><br />I can't say enough positive things about this book.  It is stimulating from both an entertainment and a literary perspective.  At times the style is intense and in your face - urging you to fight.  At others, it is more hesitant and staccato - conjuring indecision and fear.  Which style presents depends on which of the main characters is in focus.  Either way you'll find yourself immersed in a tough, dirty world of counterculture values and perverse-utopian ambitions.<br /><br />The story follows the mental collapse of a troubled young man fed-up with the work-a-day life that most of us lead.  While at his weakest, he meets the charismatic and controlling Tyler Durden who literally and figuratively takes over his life.  What ensues is a roller coaster ride of anarchism, irony, humor and terror that will keep you riveted to your seat.  It is difficult to reveal more as there is a secret that the reader must uncover, and to tell much more might ruin that surprise.  Suffice it to say that this is not your run of the mill boy meets girl - boy loses girl - boy gets girl back story.<br /><br />I've seen and enjoyed the movie many times.  And I do feel that seeing the movie before reading the book did have an impact on my reading, but not necessarily in a bad way.  What it allowed me to do was to pick up on all the clues that Palahniuk leaves along the way - most of which would be overlooked by a less informed reader.  From that perspective, seeing the movie first really added an extra dimension to my reading.  Imagine watching the movie Sixth Sense for the SECOND time and noticing all the hints the director left along the way.  Sure you miss the \\"aha\\" moment near the end, but it can be, and was, a fascinating approach to reading this book nevertheless.<br /><br />Going to have to kick something off my Listmania List to make room for this gem.  5 stars for me!make room for this gem.  5 stars for me!
0688145078|4.0|We read this only about once or so. My baby is due in a month, and my son is 3. It's very frank, which I liked, but I don't think he liked it. I think it gave him \\"uh-oh\\" kinds of feelings about the coming baby. I would recommend it, though, if you want to prepare your son or daughter for a new little one.
B000BZISTE|3.0|The movie and the features definately gets a 5 star rating. But the reason I am going for 3 stars is this, this is the third release for this movie. Face it, this package is a rehash of this product: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXB7/qid=1140458090/sr=1-12/ref=sr_1_12/103-0690481-8915815?s=dvd&v=glance&n=130 <br /> <br />I feel that Fox Home Video is trying to make money over rehashed releases.  <br /> <br />First, the Five-Star Collection <br /> <br />Then the single disc edition <br /> <br />Now this?????  <br /> <br />I like the movie, but I am wondering why Fox is wanting to re-re-release this move. It doesn't make sense (unless if they are wanting money).
1400032717|5.0|Not only will this book dazzle avid readers of all sorts, but it will grab new and less serious readers as well.  I am the first, in a book club, read for the fun of it, read whenever I can. My husband is the second, reading much more casually and mainly on trips. <br /> <br />We both enjoyed this book for many different reasons, him for the amazing story gave him a peek inside autism.  For me this was true, but the free prose, train of thought writing proved to be hilarious and heartbreaking. Follow our character as he delves into his first \\"murder mystery\\", the death of a neighbor's dog.  It will take him on a journey through his life, leaving the reader to debate what he learned through it all. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for it's honesty and sense of humor, but don't dive in thinking it will be all light hearted.  The issues of that those around him must deal with, from counsleors to his father trying to raise him on his own, will at times hurt your heart.  This book opened my eyes to the world of autism, inspiring me to learn more, and best of all, leaving me eagerly looking for my next good read.

078322933X|4.0|What makes such an impact here is that it's not that far fetched.  My ex-brother-in-law was just like Mark Wahlbergs charactor.  He was abusive and manipulitive and downright aggresive, overly protective/controling and jealous beyond no end.  That to me is what makes this movie so scary (not really scary but intence)...it's very close to home and very real.  This could happen, this does happen because there are people that are really like this.  Mark Wahlberg plays the perfect psycho, all sweet on the outside but you can see through it.  That was my brother-in-law.  You almost wonder why they bother to pretend because it's so obvious you can see through the fasade.  Too bad Reese couldn't (then again neither could me sister)...Teenage girls beware...just because he says nice things to you and you lost your virginity to him doesn't mean you should forgive him when he punches your friend in the face and tries to kill you family.  Very well acted on all fronts with a tightly wound believable script.  Recomended.

0060763280|5.0|I have gone to the Millionaire Mind Intensive twice, and right now I'm 25% of the way to being financially free.  The point of his book is that people do have \\"files\\" that influence their way of thinking and being --which stop many from becoming financially free. This is NOT a \\"how to become rich\\" book ---  nor is it meant to be. Yes, there will always be naysayers out there, but for me -- and I can only speak for myself -- because of his seminars (I've been to more than one), I have moved from complacency to action. T. Harv Eker had me doing exercises, processes, and thinking about what my thoughts, attitudes and feelings are, and how I can change them to stop preventing MYSELF from reaching my goals. <br />Let's not forget that this man reached the NYTimes best seller list the FIRST WEEK HIS BOOK WAS OUT. He is also a millionaire several times over -- to me, those are EXCELLENT qualifications of someone who I would want to mentor me, to teach me what HE does for success, so I can follow and then teach others...what better teacher can you possibly have? <br />Don't hestitate to pick up this book -- the free tickets to the seminar ALONE is proof enough that he wants to HELP others! That seminar was worth more than the $1300 he normally charges. He changed my life, I think he can change yours.

0385484518|5.0|I've heard people criticize this book for being too \\"touchy-feely.\\" Well, that's the way it's supposed to be. I'm usually not one for overly sentimental, inspirational books, but I loved \\"Tuesdays with Morrie.\\" I decided to read the book after I saw reruns of Ted Koppel interviewing Morrie Schwartz on \\"Nightline.\\" In spite of his terminal illness, Morrie really managed to embrace life to the fullest. He was also an incredibly observant, intelligent, and well-spoken man, and all of those qualities are apparent in Mitch Albom's book.<br /><br />Morrie was a college professor of Albom's, and after they'd been out of touch for many years, Albom saw the \\"Nightline\\" report about his old teacher's illness. He went to visit Morrie, and he ended up returning to see him every week. In their \\"final class\\" together, Albom asked Morrie questions about life that affect people everywhere: marriage, money, family, death, etc. After Morrie's death, Albom collected his notes from their discussions and turned them into this book. \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" is funny, sad, and inspirational. It's a story about life and death, love and respect, and making the most out of our time here on Earth and being good, decent human beings. All of that seemed to come so easily to Morrie, right until the very end.<br /><br />I wish that I could have known Morrie personally, but after reading this book, I feel like I did.

B00004HYLF|3.0|For twenty five years this album set the standard for wasted talent.The only collection of all-stars to come home so shortchanged were the 2004 LA Lakers.<br />Clearly, this is a case of the whole adding up to less than the sum of the parts. That being said, however, there are some fine moments. Al DiMeola never sounded more nasty, bluesy and powerful than on this mid-70s set. Stanley Clarke is up to his usual sonic genius. There is also plenty of great interplay among all these wonderful players.<br />The problems stem from their forays into clasical music that are pretentious, dated and silly.<br />There is really nothing memorable as far as songs go, rather like TOTO, they come off as fine studio musicians who have nothing to say and no way to say it.
6305327041|1.0|I was recommended this movie by a friend here at college, and because he spoke so highly of it, I thought I would just buy it instead of rent it. I definitely regret that decision. If you're thinking of buying it - rent it first. It was dull and obnoxious, not to mention weird. The only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate (which is why I gave it 1 star instead of 0). However, if you're still interested, definitely rent it, you might enjoy it.
B00006J3WH|5.0|An amazing musical. The quality of the songs and the lyrics are not only funny but done very well. If you are an avid Buffy fan this cd is for you. Plus if you loved the musical episode as much as I do, this has to be in your collection of Buffy memorabilia.

B0007PAMR4|3.0|This is a very fascinating film and story. It pushes boundaries and goes far beyond present human experiences.     But the widescreen format, that so many other films also are released in today, presents problems, and therefore pulls down my rating for this DVD. The top and bottom of the picture is cropped; close-ups of actors have the tops of their heads chopped off, and full-body shots sometimes have the feet chopped off. This is very annoying. There was never an artist in history who painted a portrait of a face in that way. And I make the following question: Do widescreen TVs really have so narrow and long proportions that this is necessary? Or more importantly, DID the film actually look like this in theaters?? (Edit February 22, 2006: Someone told me that the film looked the same way in theaters. In that case I partly apologize. But I still insist that portrait focus should include all of the head. Unless you are focusing on a particular part, like the eyes, for its own sake.)     As to the Extended Edition. Perhaps it can be seen as a \\"Judas treachery of Smithee-reens against artistic integrity Booth by \\"screenplayer\\" and \\"director\\"\\". It does have some awful editing. And repetitions of the same exact shot; like a landing spaceship in several places where it doesn't belong. And misunderstandings of the original film; when Paul Atreides is introduced, he turns off the computor as the three men enters the room, and smiles because he knows them by their steps (but in this version it appears as if he smiles at seeing Princess Irulan on the computor screen which hasn't been turned off). And the illustrations in the beginning of the film is an outrage; they have no cinematic value. Also, some unpleasant and scary parts from the original film have been censored and cut out, because this extended version was originally made for TV long ago. This DVD is a very lame effort at presenting an Extended Edition.   But still, the new material that we get, although just a part of all that was originally shot (Lynch's intended version was about 250 minutes long), is very helpful information to better understand and appreciate the story of Dune. And there are beautiful essential details added in some scenes, that really should have been included in the original film.     Edit February 22, 2006: David Lynch has said that he would be willing to complete an extended final version but doesn't know if he could. There are obstacles, because there is no background soundtrack for the remaining footage. Personally I think it will be difficult to make an extended version, now after over 20 years, that will flow and have the same feel and sound as the original film; but surely a better version than the one on the present DVD can be made.
B00005JOIF|1.0|This is without a doubt one of the worst films I've had to sit through in recent years. Despite the great hype surrounding the movie (largely generated by clever and misleading advertising), it fails on all fronts. The story unfolds in a slow and predictable fashion. Long periods of boredom are punctuated by scenes of gruesome, graphic violence that are much better suited for a horror film. The movie revels in this brutality to such an extent that the real message is lost. In as much, it becomes what it pretends to condemn - senseless violence. There is most definitely a deep and compelling meaning in this sad real-life story, but, as usual, Speilberg fails to find it.
0784011176|1.0|If you are a music enthusiast, then this is the perfect movie for you.  However, if you are like me, someone who falls asleep at the sound of a piano key and who hates slow pace movies, then stick this movie in the garbage right away.  I have never been so bored watching a movie in my life.  The fact that this movie is up for a grammy just makes my laugh.  I had to watch this movie for 5 days in my lit class this fall, and fell asleep every time.  I'm the type of kid who loves action, comedy, sports and of course, gorey movies.  This movie was as far away from any of those characteristics as possible.  I would definately not reccommend this movie to anyone who doesn't have a sleeping disorder.  However, if Insomnia plagues you, then definately rent this movie.

B000AMMSQC|2.0|I watched this and the American Ballet Theatre production back to back. This Odette/Odile doesn't begin to compare to Jillian Murphy, except that she's prettier; she seems lethargic throughout, except when she does her famous spins (whatever they're called). And yes, Jillian's arms and legs are lither and more swanlike, whatever they say about this gal's limberness. The rest of the cast are even worse. The sets and costumes look left over from the Bolshoi of twenty years ago. Others have already commented on the lousy camera work (Why do they give the disc five stars when it's so badly filmed???) Especially annoying is the jester. This kind of character adds to a ballet only when he/she (one really can't tell in this case what it is) is an exceptionally talented performer. He/she in this production is definitely not. Just ordinary and in the way a lot. Both he/she and the prince are in the way during the ballroom scene when the other dancers are performing. And the corps de ballet in the ABT production is amazing--the most coordinated I've ever seen. Skip this one; get that one.
1932907009|5.0|This book has been a huge help to me for learning how to organize a script and working a classic storyline for success. It is extremely easy reading and easy to understand which is important to incorporate the lessons into your work. The system that Blake uses really does apply itself to a classic movie scheme. Also the advice on character development was excellent. After reading this I realized how much more I can bring out in a character through motives alone. The advice on log lines makes a lot of sense also, if you can develop your movie around a good log line it can tie up a lot of loose ends! I am so happy I found this book!
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Has there been a more dashing swashbuckler than Errol Flynn in the late 1930's? As this 1938 classic attests, Robin Hood is the role he was born to play. Wearing his green tights, speaking medieval dialogue, and brandishing a sword with equal aplomb, Flynn is at his charismatic peak in one of the liveliest adventures filmed during Hollywood's golden era. Hands down, this is the most definitive version of the legend of Sir Robin of Locksley, and much of the credit needs to go to veteran director Michael Curtiz and his predecessor, William Keighley.<br /><br />In successive turns (due to an astute studio decision), Curtiz and Keighley bring the fanciful tale to vibrant life with breathless pacing, elaborate sets and costumes, memorable dueling sequences and a clever script written by Norman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller. For all these virtues, the most lasting impression one has in watching the film now is the amazingly rich Technicolor courtesy of the sharp cinematography by Tony Gaudio and Sol Polito, and from my perspective, even more hue-saturated than the camerawork in the following year's \\"Gone With the Wind\\". The colors pop vividly, especially in the ornate costumes designed by Milo Anderson and sometimes a bit too excessively as in the Hawaiian Punch color of the wine pouring out of the damaged barrels.<br /><br />Set in 12th century England (though filmed outside Chico, California), the story focuses on Robin's outlaw attempts to thwart the usurper Prince John's dastardly plan to take over the throne from his absent brother, Richard the Lionhearted. Loyal to the true king, Robin collects every Saxon peasant he can find to create a resistance movement, and with his band of merry men, he must face not only John but his crafty henchman, Sir Guy of Gisbourne. As if this wouldn't keep him busy enough, Robin falls for Maid Marian, a Norman royal ward who is at first resistant but quickly succumbs to his charms and courage. This is not the type of movie where you think too deeply about character motivations or the veracity of plot developments because this is escapist fare of the highest order.<br /><br />Casting is perfect even beyond Flynn. The 21-year old Olivia de Havilland is spirited and luminous as Marian shimmering in period costume and looking most breathtaking sans headdress in a diaphanous gown as Robin bounds up to her balcony. Basil Rathbone brings roguish swagger to villainous Sir Guy, and he and Flynn amaze in their climactic sword fight when they move fluidly offscreen and are replaced briefly by their dueling shadows cast on a huge stone pillar. In a severe pageboy wig that must have been the envy of Joan Crawford, Claude Rains plays a rueful Prince John with a mocking malevolence that marks his best performances, \\"Casablanca\\" and \\"Notorious\\" included. Others fare equally well, including Alan Hale Sr. (his look-alike son was the Skipper on \\"Gilligan's Island\\") as a rascally Little John, gravelly-voiced Eugene Pallette as a portly Friar Tuck, Patric Knowles as an erudite Will Scarlet, Herbert Mundin as comical Much-the-Miller's-Son and Una O'Connor as Marian's multi-married lady-in-waiting Bess. Erich Wolfgang Korngold wrote the heroic music score with fervor. This is superb entertainment.<br /><br />The two-disc DVD set is chockfull of extras, in particular, two hour-long documentaries. One is an informative making-of 2003 feature, \\"Welcome to Sherwood Forest: The Story of the Adventures of Robin Hood\\", and the other is the even more interesting \\"Glorious Technicolor\\" which explains the color filmmaking process, ideal given that the film represents one of the best uses of the process. Also entertaining is film historian Rudy Behlmer's enthusiastic audio commentary and a Leonard Maltin-hosted replication of what the 1938 movie-going experience was like, including a trailer for \\"Angels with Dirty Faces\\", a newsreel, a musical short and a cartoon. There are two more Robin Hood-inspired cartoons, ancient outtakes and bloopers and trailers for 12 of Flynn's films. This is one of the more impressive DVD packages on the market.t outtakes and bloopers and trailers for 12 of Flynn's films. This is one of the more impressive DVD packages on the market.
B00007LTIL|5.0|I really enjoy this cd, but I wanted to write a review because it seems no ones adressed the matter of the ridiculous live track of \\"truckin\\" in which Bob Weir must have been stoned out of his skull (I love Weir's singing, but hey, this is really unbelievably bad) along with everyone else. occasionaly he hits the right notes, but in general its pure chaos. He even sings the wrong lyrics in the last verse and Jerry Garcia corrects him. <br />So even if you've heard the fantastic tunes like \\"Sugar Magnolia\\" and \\"Box of Rain\\" on the Greatist hits cd, it's worth buying this just for this ridiculous truckin.
B0000UJL96|2.0|In my opinion, this is the worst ST movie. Apart from the effects, ST V was better. <br />ST VI was extremely long, involved lots of \\"commentary\\" dialogue (where the writer seemed to be extrememly concerned that we all think him well-read and intelligent), and not much plot movement. <br />It would have made a better episode, with some tight editing, <br />The best part of the movie is the last 15 minutes when the incredibly obvious \\"secret plot\\" is finally revealed, and the Enterprise shoots the modified photon torpedo at the \\"To be or not to be\\" captain. <br /> <br />Don't waste your money, unless you HAVE to have the whole collection. ST V is funnier. The Voyage Home (IV) is the best.

B000069AUI|5.0|I bought this cd when it first came out. I already owned their debut album and loved it to death! Now reviewing this cd about 5yrs later, I have to say I still listen to this cd the most. I find myself constantly coming back to this particular album. The songs resonate still in my life. Many of the songs on this album carry a powerful emotion that follow me throughout my work day. I have to say the only song I can't stand to listen to on this album to this very day is \\"Whispers\\". I really hate that song! <br /> <br />The only other song that tempts me to erase it from the cd is \\"Daylight\\" but I hold back b/c once the ending chorus comes in \\"...slowly breaking through a daylight...\\" chimes in, I'm hooked till it ends. All the other songs on this album are just as amazing as the first day I listened to them. If you are looking for a beautiful, moody, and melodic cd to listen to for years to come please do yourself a favor and buy this album. Coldplay has managed to capture my heart. This album is definitely on my favorites of all time list.
B0001I55OC|4.0|This film has something for everyone: romance, treachery, action and adventure, archaeology, medieval history and weaponry, and great special effects in the medieval battle scenes. Gerard Butler steals the film from lead Paul Walker in this loose adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel. In the film, archaeologists travel to medieval France in an attempt to rescue their leader, who is stuck there due to time travels gone awry. The time-travelers arrive in the middle of the medieval Hundred Years War at Castlegard, France.  Fantastic special effects are featured in nighttime battle scenes with medieval weaponry: flame throwing contraptions called trebuchet, night arrows, and flaming arrows. Exciting hand to hand combat and swordfighting between Andr Marek (Butler) and DeKerre (Martin Csokas), French Lord Arnaut (Lambert Wilson) and English Lord Oliver (Michael Sheen) add to the suspense. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to anyone who likes medieval history, action and adventure films.
0895260131|4.0|I'm on my third reading of this book and have had access to a pocket-sized Qur'an (helpfully provided gratis while working in Libya and published by the King Fahd Complex in Saudi Arabia).<br /><br />By looking up quotations cited by Mr Spencer from the Qur'an and comparing them with this authorized translation, I am struck by the close approximation of his source (presumably the Dawood version) and the Saudi sanctioned one. Indeed, my version has the added advantage of an English commentary by the authors which elaborates on the thorny issue of the term 'jihad'.  There seems no doubt whatsoever that this term is used not in the personal struggle every human being has to overcome bad and promote good in his psyche, but in the 'lesser jihad' interpretation of defending Islam through pre-emptive attacks on all and any who oppose it.

0670034711|5.0|This book changed my life.  The act of reading Gilbert's text is a meditation. As you follow her on her journey, you begin to explore your own life, your fears, your biggest hopes. Maybe we can't all travel the world to heal our wounds, but this book is healing power. It asks us to dig down deep, to go places we're not sure we want to go, and then it asks us to move on, changed. This book is not a \\"self help\\" book by any means, but it is clear that Elizabeth Gilbert wants her readers to experience pure joy, to live our best lives; she cares that much about each and every one of us. The gift she give us is this: as we finish the book, we realize that we care that much about ourselves.

068987474X|5.0|Greg cracks me up. He is quite honest in this book, can be brutally honest, really. But honesty is the best policy when you have guys that are jerks in life. It was a great idea to have a guy and a girl write the book because you get both sides. His side is telling you his past mistakes in relationships, and how to avoid getting wrapped up in jerks in the future. Her side, is basically taking womens' sides, and allowing us to be able to make ths mistake and her have our back when it comes to Greg.<br /><br />We have all been there, in some way, shape or form throughout this book. I could not put the thing down. Was not written in clinical text, was very easy to understand and some of Greg's humor makes the reading og by so much quicker than usual.<br /><br />I'd read this book again, and again. I'd recommend it to any woman in the dating world right now.<br /><br />Pay close attnetion to the things Greg says, even though it may seem like he's being a little harsh, he's trying to prevent heartbreak for us in the future.<br /><br />Please read

The shared interest between both characters develops into some kind of platonic \\"sexual tension\\".Griet wants to be more than a mere servent, she wants to learn and she doesn't let Vermeer break her heart,since, at the same time, she pursues a relationship with her \\"butcher boy\\" Pieter. <br />The movie based on this book is extremely mediocre comparing to the story in the novel.For one, it ommitted the plague episode, also Griet's brother, and the original ending which pretty much explains what the relationship between Vermeer and his maid was truly all about.My advice: forget the movie, read the book first. It is a real pleasure.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|I just got a great surprise in the mail (well UPS) today, my Collector Case!!  I had sent my check out the day the 10th season came out.  I forget when the check cleared but the box came today.  I had just read on TVSHOWSONDVD.com about a delay due to Warner Brothers misjudging the popularity of the case but they would be out soon.  I can say it was worth the wait!
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Like so many others, I thought Tim Burton's bold move to take on one of the classic films of all-time was going to crash and burn in his face.  Who else could EVER be Willy Wonka except for Gene Wilder?  I mean the man's entire career was predicated on that ONE role that he performed so masterfully complete with strange personality and a song or two to boot!<br /><br />But imagine my surprise when I decide to buy the Burton-version of \\"Charlie & The Chocolate Factory\\" with Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka.  As I watched this film, I couldn't believe that the actor playing Wonka was the same man who played in \\"Pirates of the Carribean!\\"  Depp's wide range of acting skills is amazing!<br /><br />From the high-pitched voice to the nervous words and actions, Depp's portrayal of Wonka reveals a much more psychologically-challenged man who we get to see a glimpse of what made him that way through frequent flashbacks to his childhood.  I rather enjoyed this aspect of the movie because it filled in some blanks that were left unaccounted for in the original.<br /><br />As it turns out, Charlie (played by an adorable young actor with an excellent British accent) helps Wonka resolve the issues he had with his own childhood and bring resolution to years of trying to prove he was right after all.  Excellent storyline!<br /><br />Even if you are a big fan of the original film like I was, you need to get this one, too!  Burton was brilliant and Depp was delightful!  A great addition to your DVD library!
0380778556|4.0|I am a fan of neither mysteries nor romances.  I feel like I got my fill of Nancy Drew before junior high and enough mindless bodice rippers while I suffered through an early marriage and divorce.  It seems inifinitely difficult for books from these genres to be anything but formulaic.  Since this book is promoted as both a mystery and a romance, I doubted that I would be interested.<br /><br />To my relief and surprise, I found that \\"Rebecca\\" is really a fascinating study of complex characters.  Daphne Du Maurier eeks out tantalizing details about each character in a way that establishes palpable tension and suspense.  The primary characters are involved in a new marriage, so loosely the story may be perceived to have a romantic subtext.  However, it is the characters that provide interest.<br /><br />Furthermore, Du Maurier drives the story, the characters, and the suspense with language that is carefully and skillfully crafted to move the arc of the plot irresistably toward the climax.  Her sentences are dense with meaning and ambiance.  Her writing consistently adds to the atmosphere and the readers' involvement with the characters.  Her words and sentence structure flow smoothly and are never distracting.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a well-written, tightly woven character study with an effortless plot that moves the reader through the twists and turns of life.

0684824906|5.0|Frankly, until reading this book, I did not fully understand the nature and extent of the circumstances in which Lincoln included in his cabinet those who, prior to his election, were his major political opponents and who, in addition, viewed him with contempt. Specifically, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, William H. Seward, and Edwin M. Stanton. He then worked effectively with each throughout the Civil War. Even more remarkable is the fact that, by the time of Lincoln's assassination, each of these four had grown to love as well as respect someone whom Stanton had once described as a \\"long armed Ape.\\"<br /><br />Senior-level executives can learn a number of important lessons in leadership by reading this book. They include:<br /><br />1. Surround yourself with whatever talent the given enterprise requires.<br />2. Welcome, indeed strongly encourage principled dissent.<br />3. Timing is not everything but often the difference between success and failure.<br />4. Exercise selective hearing during a contentious group discussion.<br />5. Unless absolutely certain, be willing to grant benefit of the doubt.<br />6. Exhaust opponents by listening to them.<br />7. Appreciate effort but only reward performance.<br />8. Serve \\"with malice toward none, with charity for all\\"<br />9. And lead \\"with firmness in the right.\\"<br />10. When dealing with forceful personalities, focus on common interests.<br /><br />As Kearns quite correctly asserts, only a \\"political genius\\" could have assembled and then worked effectively with cabinet members such as Chase, Bates, Seward, and Stanton, all of whom were independent thinkers, had personal agendas, and (at least initially) considered themselves superior to Lincoln in all respects. With all due respect to Lincoln's leadership and management skills, however, it should also be noted that Bates eventually described Lincoln as \\"very near being a perfect man.\\" His inherent decency and impeccable integrity informed and guided his leadership and management as president.<br /><br />As I read Kearns's book, I realized that only by preserving the unity of his diverse cabinet could Lincoln have preserved the Union. Had he been able to complete his second term, his \\"political genius\\" would have enabled him to fulfill hopes he expressed in his second Inaugural Address: \\"to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\\"ealized that only by preserving the unity of his diverse cabinet could Lincoln have preserved the Union.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|In the past week I have seen a movie that I thought I was going to love but ended up disliking and a movie that I thought I was going to dislike but found myself loving.  The former was BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, which I found physically beautiful to look at, but whose characters I found to be uninteresting and bland.  The latter was PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.  The reason I thought that I was going to dislike it was the existence of an absolutely superb BBC mini-series, which seemed to me to be the last word on what could be done with Jane Austen's masterpiece.  I was wrong.  Not only is there room for a truly great six-hour television version but also for an excellent two-hour cinematic version.<br /><br />I still prefer the BBC version.  There are two reasons.  First, there probably will never be a better Mr. Darcy than Colin Firth.  Laurence Olivier might have had a shot in the 1940 Hollywood version, but that film was destroyed by an almost inconceivable rewriting of many of the key elements (the worst being making Lady Catherine de Bourgh into a matchmaker between Darcy and Elizabeth).  Matthew Macfadyen is an extremely capable Darcy, but it was as if Colin Firth were born to play the part.  The other advantage of the BBC production is time:  there is simply no way that a two-hour movie can do as good a job of adapting the novel as a six-hour production.  In watching the BBC version, one gets the sense that almost nothing of importance gets left out, whereas with the movie I found myself constantly regretting parts of the story that had of necessity to be left out.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there is no questioning the excellence of this new movie version.  Simply because the series does a fuller job of telling the story does not mean that this movie cannot excel in a shorter time span.  The film definitely feels abridged, yet one also feels that most (though certainly not all) of the most important bits have been retained.  With most adaptations of a novel this might not have been such a problem, but PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is one of the best known and beloved novels in the English language (I have read it five times, see the Garson-Olivier version twice, and the BBC version three times).  Given the time restrictions, I believe the movie did as good a job as is possible.<br /><br />The film does have some advantages over the television version.  First, it is remarkably gorgeous to look at.  Whether we are beholding household interiors or shots of the countryside, this film was a delight to behold.  Also, with the exception of Jena Malone as Lydia and the aforementioned Colin Firth, most of the performances in the film version are a bit stronger.  I wouldn't say Keira Knightly is better than Jennifer Ehle, but she is definitely a different Elizabeth.  Let's just acknowledge that both are superb.  I recently saw Kelly Reilly (actually, all of Kelly Reilly) in the wonderful MRS. HENDERSON PRESENTS.  Here is plays Miss Bingley and does a fine job.  Rosamund Pike is excellent as Elizabeth's slightly more beautiful sister Jane.  Well, she isn't noticeably more attractive than Keira Knightly, but she'll do.  Two supporting performances stand out.  First, Tom Hollander was superb as a completely different kind of Mr. Collins.  In all other versions, Collins is presented as an utter buffoon.  In defense of previous versions, Mr. Collins is a buffoon in Austen's novel.  But it is nice to see him as slightly less absurd.  And Brenda Blethyn, one of the great actresses of her generation, manages to make Mrs. Bennett into more than merely a silly cartoon.  In his book ASPECTS OF THE NOVEL, E. M. Forster makes a distinction between flat and round characters and argues that Jane Austen loves to mix the two types.  His example of a flat character is Mrs. Bennett.  And while it remains true that Ms. Blethyn isn't able to transform her into a deep character, she does keep her from being the silly twit seen in previous versions.  The one other character thatdid not appreciably improve upon the BBC production was, surprisingly, Judi Dench's Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  Part of the problem is that most of her scenes were shot in a somewhat subdued manner; partly she obviously decided not to play the role as a broad character.<br /><br />Finally, the movie works in very large part because of the chemistry between Keira Knightly's Elizabeth and Matthew Macfadyen's Darcy.  Though one genuinely misses the many big scenes early in the story in the BBC production where Darcy's pride is made manifest and Elizabeth forms her prejudices, in the romantic portions they are great together.  Also, Knightly is one of the few actresses to play the part and be the age that Elizabeth is actually supposed to be.  All in all, they click onscreen.<br /><br />So, I guess this should be a lesson that you shouldn't prejudge a film.  You actually can be surprised.  In fact, in the past couple of months, the two films that I most enjoyed in the theater were two that I didn't expect to like, the other being KING KONG.  So I suppose this is a lesson previously learned that has now been reinforced.er that did not appreciably improve upon the BBC production was, surprisingly, Judi Dench's Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

B00008H2LB|4.0|I must say that I really like Linkin Park, and I can't stand most nu/pop metal or whatever you want to call it, and most pop music today just flat out sucks. Linkin Park has a bit more talent then they get credit for, and sometimes I think they are unfairly judged for the fact that they get so much MTV rotation. YET, Linkin Park has kinda a cool groove, and they write some Catchy tunes. Are they great musicians? Not really, average, but the Vocals are done well, and even though they aren't anywhere near the talent level or Rage, They kinda remind me of Rage Against the Machine, for the fact that Rage combined a Hip-Hop flavor to thier crunchy Hard Rock style. Meteora is another good effort, and is just as good as the Hybrid Theory. Trust me, really give them a listen, even if you hate them. I mean I hated them when they first came out, but when I really listened to the album over and over (the first Release) I found myself listening to it all the time. They arent the Gods of Rock, nor the Greatist Band in the world, but if you are hater and listen with an open mind, you might see that have something more to offer.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is a delight for the senses.  It's exciting, funny, thought-provoking, and imaginative.  Even my 71 year old mother loves it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is one of the best, if not THE best WWII film I've ever seen.  The series was perfectly cast with wonderfully talented actors.  I loved the fact that they closely worked with most of the men from Easy Co., which contributed to the authenticity of the series.  It's an amazing way to immortalize these brave men - what a great tribute!  Damian Lewis is spectacular as Maj. Richard Winters.  From what I've read from interviews, he was told by the men of Easy Co., during the world premiere in Normandy, that he nailed his portrayal of Winters.  That must've been such a validation as an actor.  I loved him in The Forsyte Saga, and I love him even more now after seeing Band of Brothers.  This man is talented!  Everyone did an incredible job.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Well, well, well...<br /><br />I would like to say a few words on slightly different topic standing apart from loads of hailing album content reviews - that's incredibly cool 25th Anniv Set.<br /><br />At first - the sound of the original album:it is thunderous. Pure insanity. Vein-blowing riffs, bass lines and Topper's drumming.<br /><br />Resume:England owes 16 tons of sterling silver to the remastering crew of London Calling.<br /><br />At second - the Vanilla tapes. Very fascinating cd. In terms of  quality it may sound unusual to amateur ears but real rock'n'roll fans will accept it with triple pleasure.<br /><br />Ultimately creative garageland band.<br /><br />I've read hundreds of reviews proclaiming common original London Calling's price was worth $100. I agree either to this or to the fact it shoudn't be priced less than Beatles' or LedZep masterpieces. This 2-cd+1dvd set is absolutely remarkable considering brilliant demo versions, unreleased ones e.g.Lonesome Me, Heart and Mind etc. and other like coolest instrumental version of Hateful with that steely guitar sound..aaaaah, delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />At third (sweet dessert) - bunch of video footage, clips, interviews with all band members, charming history of front cover  (famous Paul-smashing-guitar-shot)  that will make your satisfaction of purchasing this Set reach the skies!<br /><br />Enjoy!!!!<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!!
B0000DEO90|5.0|wings over america is the absolute killer cd.  hard to find, but worth the effort.  beatle fan or no, this cd is one super tune after another and will have you listening again and again.  i recommend this cd...HIGHLY!
B0006399FS|5.0|Ok firstly anyone who does not understand the title of their album hands up. Ok their you go, obiviously you have never read a book about bono in your life, the title refers to bono and the atomic bomb is him, ok that out the way, this album is pure art 100% fantastic, they have found a new sound, go listen to electical storm and pop back atomic bomb in the player, ahhh now you see the direction they are at, yes u2 have taken it one step further then their contamparies, now you no why they win those grammy awards, because they keep one step ahead. After 25 years they are still ground breaking, not a sell out like some other bands i will not mention. Ok now those of you who don't understand the lyrics just listen with your ears open please. Bono is singing at times about the lonliness he feels when on tour i.e the lyric about his daughters and track 03 is a song dedicated to his father that he sang at his funeral b4 putting it on the album , track 02 about being in love and wanting to hold onto that moment forever, if you listen you will understand, but for those of you who do not appreciate art and can only understand \\"yes baby, yes baby im in love\\" well that dosent surprise me. U2 are a feeling and if you arn't tuned into it then you cannot call yourself a fan. I have loved U2 for over 10 years and they never fail to impress. I mean if you want to understand the album go and read Bono on Bono, or Bono from the heart, it will clear up any problems you don't understand about this album, so if you will excuse me i have an album that needs playing and i am going to the U2 concert here in Adelaide in march and soak up the feeling and vibe that is U2, shhhessssh can you honestly tell me that kelly clarkson, ashley simpson even lee harding are the new musical breakthroughs, please talk to me in 10 years when U2 once again take home their grammys and struggle to find a place to fit them on the mantle piece and these so called musical breakthroughs are washed up thinking what could have been, if only they were half as good and smart in the industry as U2, please it remains to be seen. So go out and get the atomic bomb album and listen to what real art is, you are sure to gain an apprecation for this fine work.....
B00004RF9B|5.0|Forbidden Planet is first in rank in a great tradition of sci fi classics.  Three other films which belong in its company is the original version of The Fly, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and The Time Machine.      All of these films deal with variations on the \\"Copernican\\" theme of seeing the earth as a speck of dust in the cosmos.  But they do so in a way full of human drama; they explore the struggle and crises faced by individual human beings as they come into contact with and/or to terms with some \\"truth\\" which is larger than human life.  The Incredible Shrinking Man of the same period, and Altered States, from the `80s, might be reckoned in the same tradition.    Yet Forbidden Planet outdoes them all from a sci-fi point of view.  This is the story of an alien race whose state of ultimate technology outlives the race itself, and of a handful of deep space explorers from earth who gradually come to realize, both by carefully studying the alien artifacts, and from their own interpersonal exchanges, that this is destiny of humanity as well.  This is not, however, a story about technology turning on its creators, as dealt with in a good number of other films.  This film pursues its theme without technology in any way becoming the bad guy or the bogey man.  The plot is far more subtle, and far more powerful.  In fact, there are no villains in this film, at least not in any conventional sense.  There are no cowboys and Indians here, mechanical or otherwise.    The unique special effects and musical score make this film a special treat.  They captivate the imagination in a way that really does justice to its plot.  Especially memorable is the film's rendition of a piece of recorded music left behind by the alien race, the mood of which echoes through the entire sound track-though the music only lasts a minute or so.  Also memorable are the visual shots of seemingly ant-sized human beings as they explore the inner world of the great machines, where arcs of electricitythe size of lightning bolts are incidental parts of its routine maintenance (reducing lightning to the status of a little static cling being automatically discharged).    A must see for sci fi fans; thoughtful and fun for any viewer.

B000AL730Y|5.0|Whether you're a fan of the Beatles or not, this CD/DVD will bring to you the magic that McCartney (as well as John, George and Ringo)has been bringing to us for over 40 years. (And if you aren't already a Beatles fan, listen to this CD and you will be. Go back and open those other wonderful treasures.) The DVD is wonderful because, apart from the magic of his musical talents, you can see that boyish spark in his eyes as he recalls how he came to create a song. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! These are the songs that will stick in your head and your heart, much as we all still sing the Beatles classics to ourselves or sing them out loud, at the top of our lungs, unabashedly, like greeting an old friend.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Undoubtedly one of the best albums ever recorded in history! Has the competition beat hands down.  Don't know many things that even come close to touching the mastery of this album.
B00006FR47|5.0|The people that call this a transitional album are mostly right.  First, it's the first single (not double) album.  It doesn't have long song-suites or tracks that clock in at 15 or 20 minutes.  The single most deceptive thing about this album is that the only hit single is \\"Saturday in the Park,\\" a poppy, happy song.  The remainder of the album is much less \\"pop.\\"  It's probably their most jazz-influenced album, really.  Hard jazz.  Cookin' jazz.  This should send instrumentalists into the stratosphere.  The standout thing...and a big surprise...is that Peter Cetera displays on this album that he's one of the best Paul McCartney-style bass players in rock history.  Really.  Don't laugh.  He totally is.  The main thing about this album is that unlike Chicago II and Chicago III, this album has a \\"feel\\" to it---a flavor or a theme.  Hard jazz rock.  It doesn't drift into country or folk or reggae...it sticks to its style.  It's a great album.
B0007PAMR4|2.0|OK...So. We finally get an region 1 release of the \\"extended\\" version of the film. Along with the theatrical release. That's why I gave it 2 stars, and that's also where the good review ends. <br /> <br />Where the hell are the special features? There's enough information  about the Dune story to fill a Lord of the Rings style 4 disc box set. Yet here all we get is a handful of nonsense. The special features seem more like highlights from a longer set of features. For christ sake the longest one clocks in at a whopping 7 mins, and change, in length. My copy of Half Baked has better, and more in depth, special features.  <br /> <br />I felt incredibly cheated after having watched this dvd. If you've never seen the extended version of Dune, pick it up just for that. Otherwise give it a pass, or buy it used. <br /> <br />PS.  <br /> Why couldn't they do DTS audio for at least the theatrical version? Even Dawn Of The Dead got DTS for it's re-release.
0553573411|4.0|I had been missing fantasy for a long time.  This is a great series.  I agree with the other reviewer that mentioned Empire Strikes Back---the middle of the Star Wars movies---as the best.  As with Star Wars, this trilogy hits its best part during the second book.  The third book was consuming, but I have to admit that the end it a bit sudden.  This series is more about the journey and the characters.  There is a real sense of family, and Hobb fleshes out some of her \\"world\\" in this book.  I agree that some of it is a touch predictable, but it didn't bother me.  Suitable for 14 years old to senior citizens.  I'm 31 and I liked it a lot.
B00005ATZT|5.0|A terrific flic; the movie really belonged to Tommy Lee Jones; lots of great shots of Chicago, and the most fantastic train crack-up ever put on film - ever.
B000069KE0|5.0|Okay...I gave it 5 stars.  It deserves 4.5, but with early Chicago, I'll err on the side of upgrading it.  This has some great hits (25 or 6 to 4, Make Me Smile, Color My World).  At this stage, however, the band was very much an albums band, not a singles band.  There are some incredible parts to this album.  The best thing about this album is 10 to 20 minute song-suites a la classical music.  There are about 3 of those suites on this album.  Those suites run the gauntlet from jazz to classical to hard acid  1960s rock a la Woodstock.  The worst moments are where some of the swinging 60s sound a little dated...a bit like those transitions in the Austin Powers movies.  Especially \\"Fancy Colors.\\"  There are about 5 clunkers, and some of the lyrics are simplistic.  That said, this is a double album...and there is far more than 1 album's worth of 5 star stuff here.  Don't let any of the negative comments turn you off.  Jump in...the clunkers aren't that awful, and the great stuff is totally worth the price of admission.
B000055Y0Y|3.0|Although critics have raved over this, as did just about everyone I knew who saw it, I thought it just OK.  The plot was simply too formulaic, but Eastwood and especially Malkevich, were riveting.
B000069KGM|5.0|I'm just writing to bring the rating closer to 5 stars.  This album is essentially Jimi Hendrix with horns, rounded out by Steve Winwood on organs.  That's the basic feel.  Both the songs and the playing are better than the Allman Brothers' Live at the Fillmore.  There are 3 great lead singers---the Jimi-meets-Ray-meets-Greg Allman: Terry Kath.  The smooth, Sinatra-esque Robert Lamm, and the high, piercing rock of Peter Cetera.  Something for everyone.  This is progressive, jazz-infused, 60s acid rock.  They should've played at Woodstock.  Do not expect this to resemble Chicago during the 1980s (i.e. You're the Inspiration).
B0000026NC|4.0|A lot of people didn't think Gilmour and company would (or could) do it, but they did. And, boy, did they! I can remember when Gilmour, Mason, and Wright took it on the road; it was all I heard about for months. I surprised a lot of people by not attending any of the shows myself, but circumstance and money didn't allow it to happen. So, I wound up getting the \\"Delicate Sound\\" recording, and the video version on VHS. And, of course, I played them to death.<br /><br />A lot of this music doesn't sound very different from their studio counterparts, and I see why some would have a problem with this. But even the selections rendered note-for-note, have a different ambience to them, and the mood of these performances is conveyed nicely. Where some detractors say the band is only going through the motions, and Gilmour sounds and looks bored, I would have to disagree. I think he's relaxed. The video version shows the band at ease, smiling and laughing, apparently at some inside jokes, and just enjoying what they are doing. They are good, and they know it. Performing without their full compliment, sans Waters, they seem to be a lesser entity, but they more than make up for this with a stellar roster of support on this particular tour, in 1987-88. On \\"Momentary Lapse,\\" Waters was replaced with Tony Levin, of King Crimson fame, and here, he is replaced with Guy Pratt. Nick Mason is playing drums, but percussionist Gary Wallis is drumming as well, and is adding all the little percussion parts. Rick Wright is playing keyboards as well as doing some singing (not sounding as good as he once did, but still enjoyable) here, and is backed up by Jon Carin, also on keys and vocals. Scott Page is playing guitar and saxophone, and the astonishing thing about him, apart from his killer sax playing, is he is probably the only rock musician in the world to have never heard \\"The Dark Side Of The Moon\\" before joining the band. What rock was he living under? Tim Renwick is playing rhythm guitar, as well as some of the guitar solos, and Gilmour gives him plenty of room to do as he pleases. This line-up is capped off with Margaret Taylor, Durga McBroom, and the stunningly beautiful Rachel Fury on backing vocals.<br /><br />They go through the repertoire, seemingly by rote, but considering the scale of the production, there is very little wiggle-room. The first half of the set is largely material from \\"Momentary Lapse Of Reason,\\" the new release at the time, the exception being parts I through V of \\"Shine On, You Crazy Diamond.\\" There is an authenticity when Waters sings this, but he's not present. And I prefer Gilmour's voice on this song, anyway. They give you \\"Learning To Fly,\\" \\"Dogs Of War,\\" \\"On The Turning Away,\\" \\"Yet Another Movie,\\" \\"Round And Around,\\" and \\"Sorrow,\\" all played competently, but not very different from the originals, only the sound itself. But as I said earlier, the difference in the sound itself is worth hearing, especially if you pay attention to these things.<br /><br />The second half delves into the vintage material, a good sounding \\"One Of These Days\\" kicks it off, leading into \\"Time,\\" but for some reason, they left out the \\"Breathe Reprise.\\" It sounds incomplete, because the last line says, \\"...Thought I'd something more to say...,\\" then trails off. They go through the older songs, to the delight of the die-hard fans, but my huge disappointment here, is the omission of \\"The Great Gig In The Sky.\\" This, as well as \\"On The Run\\" are on the video, but here, they are conspicuous in their abscence. Wright plays the opening bars to \\"Great Gig,\\" and you see the women gearing up. Rachel Fury takes the first part, and does a good job, the music quiets down, and Durga McBroom takes over, gently singing the middle vocal. THEN! Fasten your seat belt, because Margaret Taylor sings the finale, and if the hair on your arm doesn't stand on end, and your eyes don't tear up, there's something wrong with you. I am really, really disappointed this isn't on the CD or the audio cassette. I'll never know why this was omitted.<br /><br />And so it goes, until the encores, \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" and \\"Run Like Hell.\\" They are probably very tired of playing these songs, so many, many times, but the fans will always want them. And I still like them. Always will.sn't on the CD or the audio cassette. I'll never know why this was omitted.<br /><br />And so it goes, until the encores, \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" and \\"Run Like Hell.\\" They are probably very tired of playing these songs, so many, many times, but the fans will always want them.

B000BCKFWK|5.0|This is s perfect, and I mean absolutely perfect translation of the Frank Miller books of Sin City, a bunch of them, into movement. Rather than trying to create a continuous feature-length film, the filmmakers--Robert Rodriguez, QT, and Miller himself--have forged separate stories, just as Miller's books are, so that characters live and die in the space of five, ten, 20 minutes. But that's cool.<br /><br />What makes this so different is the amazing visual look and feel. Miller creates his graphic novel stuff in stark black and white with splashes of red--for blood, lipstick, passion (in the form of a red dress), and the thrill of action. Red bursts through here in the film too, right from the get go. Becky wears a bright red dress, has bright red lips...<br /><br />Speed (as in velocity) is here too, as is brute strength and eruptions of violence. The sere wizened face of corruption turns up, time and again. The hardened look of the men and women who've seen too much bad stuff--bad as in what people do to each other--to look happy ever again. They move from one frame to another, giving life to these emotions in a way that you just can't do on the printed page, even if it's illustrated.<br /><br />Cops and hitmen, hookers and psychos are all here. So what's the message? It's that we don't do what we should, do we? We treat each other badly and that's true even if we have a badge or a title that says we're not supposed to. Has that message been thrown out to us before? Sure. But the way this film does it makes it totally fresh and unique. This is an original piece of work like nothing else out there--sure as hell like no other \\"comic book adaptation\\" we've seen before.<br /><br />A completely different take on how to move a \\"comic book\\" into cinematic form, a whole lot of filmmaker folks should take a lesson from this. Let's see what Sin City 2 does, due out later this year. I'll be there.<br /><br />You betcha.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is a terrific movie to watch when life seems tough and you're feeling sorry for yourself.  Have some laughs and forget your problems.  I also like the film's basic messages.  First, that looks aren't everything.  Second, that life really hands you some twists and turns you weren't expecting.  Smart people roll with the punches and make lemonade from the lemons.

B000CCD0FI|5.0|What is arguably the very best CD of the 80's, and certainly of a career, is now out in an absolutely stirring remastering CD and DVD side. Arguments about the format notwithstanding, this is an essential disc to re-purchase. It sounds F*C%ING UNBELIEVABLE. The presence and definition on the CD side is stunning. The 5.1 separation on the DVD side will jar you. Along with REMAIN IN LIGHT, This disc remains light years ahead of anything that has come in its wake.<br /><br />What was lost in the vinyl, and not all that great on the first set of CDs now makes sense. What you hear going on in the different levels will thrill you, get you dancing and have you grinning from ear to ear. The DVD side has some nice video and the packaging is up to TH trend setting standards. I still have the Robert Rauschenberg vinyl of this, and will likely never play it, but this one from an audio perspective is every bit the treasure of the RR.
B000003N7K|5.0|There is no shortage of great jazz recordings! The lengends include (and are not limited to): Sarah, Billie, Ella, Nat, Frankie, Tony, and more. Each singer has a distinct sound quality and approach to the sandards as well as thier own. <br /> <br />One of the lesser-known jazz vocalists was Johnny Hartman. The closest thing to him was Nat (King Cole), but Nat has a softer voice with a bit less bass. Johnny Hartman only recorded a handful of recordings, this one by far his best. <br /> <br />John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman is as soft and sweet as an aged bottle of Merlot. With Johnny's deep and rich vocals, the typical ballad expertiese of the John Coltrane 'Classic' Quartet iss taken into a land of soft romance and reflection.  <br /> <br /> <br />This is one seldom-mentioned champ of the jazz/vocalist combination. For ANY jazz fan, the mere mention of John Coltrane will excite them to buy this gem. However, few will know about the supreme locals of Johnny Hartman. To get an idea of what the album does, think about Nat King Cole with the John Coltrane Quartet singing slow to dead slow ballads. <br /> <br /> <br />YES....THAT GOOD!

B000BYA5GO|4.0|Andrew Niccol's Lord of War is a very good piece of filmmaking. Niccol takes a serio-comic look at the machinations of the necessary evil that are freelance international arms dealers. This subject has been done before but with disastrous results with the Chevy Chase and Gregory White comedy vehicle, Deal of the Century. Niccol's film is much better due to its subject matter having more resonance in this era of post-Cold War and post-9/11. It also is inherently better due to another fine performance out of Nicholas Cage who has to have cornered the market on deadpan delivery of dialogue that has full comedic timing and at the same time fills a scene with dramatic weight.<br /><br />Lord of War is the story of one Yuri Orlov. A Ukrainian-born American who grows up in what he calls a different type of hell from communist USSR: Brighton Beach, USA. The film encompasses' Yuri's lowly beginnings as an amateur arms dealer selling to the Ukrainian mob enforcers in his neighborhood. Yuri is a quick learner and soon convinces his younger brother Vitaly (played by Jared Leto) to be his right-hand man. He needs someone to watch his back during his negotiations and sales and sees his brother as the best man for the job. Most of the film is told through as a flashback as Yuri narrates observations he'd made throughout his career as an international arms dealer willing to straddle the line between legal and illegal. In fact, he becomes so good at evading authorities that he soons goes from an amateur being dismissed by the Old Guard arms dealers (one played as an almost conscience to Yuri's amoral ways by Sir Ian Holm)to one who adapts fastest to the new world order of small conflicts that erupts as a consequence to the end of the Cold War. It is during these turbulent times that Yuri develops a business and almost symbiotic relationship with a Liberian warlord named Andres Baptiste, Sr (a chilling and stand out performance by Eamonn Walker) and his even more psychotic son Andres, Jr.<br /><br />We see Yuri from his lowyly beginnings to the height of his power as an elite in the shadowy world of secondary arms dealing. This is even made more pointed when his best customer, warlord Andres Baptiste points out that his people and enemies call him the lord of war, but he believes Yuri deserves that title even more. Yuri is the Lord of War as he sells to both sides in a conflict and tries to justify his amoral business practices by proclaiming that if he didn't sell them the weapons then a dozen others will. Even as he keeps an emotional detachment from the suffering and destruction his practices has wrought worldwide, especially in war-torn West Africa, Yuri's life is complicated even more by the dogged efforts of Interpol agent Jack Valentine (played with boy-scout righteousness by Ethan Hawke) who has made busting Yuri his goal in life. Add Vitaly who has become addicted to cocaine in no small part to his participation in Yuri's business dealings and a trophy wife in Ava Fontaine (played by Bridget Moynahan in a thankless role) all goes to make Yuri's personal and business life another hell he has put himself into.<br /><br />Yuri as a character would've become too much of a caricature if not for the deadpan performance by Nicholas Cage. Cage infuses the character with an almost resigned personality. A permanent ennui at having witnessed atrocities he himself might have caused with his arms dealing, but at the same time know that this is the only thing he's really best at. Cage has lived off playing such characters and even brings back glimpses of a similar but more powerful performance he had in Leaving Las Vegas. Both the character in that film and in Niccol's work have a resigned attitude about how their life has been, but where one gives in to his ennui and becomes suicidal, the Yuri character cannot stop doing what he does even if it meant losing everything he loved and being left disowned and alone.<br /><br />The film is very blunt about the evil that is the international arms trade, but Niccol and his writers have also pointed out that it is an evil that could be stopped if not for the major governments who have used these individuals as a necessary evil to push their strategic and political agenda for the rest of the world. Lord of War doesn't condemn arms dealers like Yuri Orlov. What it does condemn is the political atmosphere and machinations behind the global scene that makes such people necessary. Even though Orlov is not a true person he does seem based off the actual life and events of one Victor Bout whose life and career as an arms dealer mirrors that of Yuri's.<br /><br />Niccol's Lord of War is not a perfect film, but it is very timely in this new age of a world become more complicated with the end of the Cold War with terrorists, warlords and atrocities committed by the poorests of nations and its people. The heavy-handed message told through the film is saved by the excellent work by Nicholas Cage as the title character with great support from Eamonn Walker as Liberian Warlord Baptiste.

B00005S6K8|5.0|Sabrina is a Cinderella story for modern times, and is also a fine update to the classic film that starred Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden. Sabrina (Julia Ormond) is the plain-looking daughter of a chauffeur to a wealthy family, and comes back transformed after an internship in Paris. She attracts the attention of the family's younger, playboy son (Greg Kinnear), and his older brother (Harrison Ford) must woo Sabrina away before she spoils the marriage/business merger he has been orchestrating.<br /><br />It's a very charming film, and is one of the few modern romantic comedies that makes you happy for the Hollywood ending instead of gagging at the cliche. It also avoids the typical bathroom humour and cheap gags, and stays relatively true to the original script with emphasis on character and dialogue. Some updates have been made though, sometimes to modernize (the wonder-plastic of the original has now been integrated into a flat screen tv) and sometimes to poke fun at story elements that were more acceptable in the 50s (Bogart could effortlessly kiss his brother's girlfriend and keep it within the family....Ford gets slapped). The cast is excellent all around. Julia Ormond is not Audrey Hepburn, but she makes the role her own and actually makes the Cinderella aspect of the plot more convincing. And in true 90's fashion, all the characters are deeper and more sympathetic, giving the cast more to play on.<br /><br />Sabrina is a fine film, on its own and compared to the original. If you're in the mood for some retro Hollywood charm all modernized into a lovely package, you can't go wrong with this film.
B000000Y87|5.0|What a glorious Sunday in 1961. And how close to us and avant our own present garde these compositions remain. This is a fabulous recording of unspeakable beauty and, when it comes to Scott laFaro, I doubt there has been a greater loss for mankind in the entire music of the XXth century. His life was pure love to his vocation; for us now, a couple of generations ahead, one cannot be grateful enough that these two albums, Sunday at the Village Vanguard and Waltz for Debby, have remained as a monogramic portrait of this superb master.<br /><br />Bill Evans, on his turn, needs no comments. His musical life was long and prolific; yet, many jazz-lovers who know him much better than me like to say that the peak of his musical powers and inspiration was in this trio. Paul Motian's brush makes the whole thing, to quote Mozart's famous sentence, 'as smooth as oil', and the arrangements made by these three make up for one of the best musical clockworks I have ever heard. Pixinguinha's days with Benedito Lacerda's group and the Miles Davis Quintet with Ron Carter can perhaps be mentioned as their ideal counterparts, when one looks for other manifestations of the same level.<br /><br />LaFaro's compositions, Gloria's Step and Jades's Vision, are already unique and genial in their own right. The first is intelligent, witty and lively, the second mysterious and even mystical: each note is necessary and yet goes beyond into unimaginable realms. Later, electric bass would see a composition of similar depth and care with Jaco Pastorius' Portrait of Tracy. The trio version of My Man's Gone Now is in my opinion definitive, never surpassed either in instrument or voice. The Village Vanguard CD sets me in awe and wonder; it is one of my desert-island choices, all-time favorite music recordings.
0440237688|2.0|The Giver is every adolescent's frustrated view of the world projected into a fictional future reality. Pills keep you from enjoying sex, your parents are obsessive-compulsively normal, and only one person in the whole city knows what's going on and how things got that way. One very special boy decides to break the chain. So far so good: we're talking Huck Finn in the 22nd century. Unfortunately, our hero's end is so open-ended, it begins to feel like the clones back in squaresville had it right all along. In my world, that makes The Giver a moral tale in support of oppressive conformity hiding in the sheep's clothing of an anti-social fable. Gross. Sometimes  being coy is just wrong.
B000BBOUU4|3.0|This version is much darker than the book or the 1971 film.  Having said that, there are one or two great scenes in this remake particularly the squirrel scene ... but just not enough good scenes to really pull me in.      Add to that, the film seemed very rushed.  I am glad I rented this, rather than purchasing it.

B00000JPYD|5.0|Robin Trower took guitar tone to a new level in the 70's.  From an age in which guitar reigned supreme, Trower stands out from the hordes of guitar heros, thanks to his unparallelled ability to make his Fender Strat sing, wail and occasionally scream.  Although Trower would later delve deeper into the world of effects processors (listen to, say, Caravan to Midnight), at this stage in his career, his sound was relatively spare - distortion, a bit of wah-wah, and the Uni-Vibe (a swirly sounding effect made famous by Hendrix) are pretty much all he used here.<br /><br />But as anyone who has ever seen Trower live knows, the secret behind this remarkable sound lies within Trower's hands.  With his complete control over bends, vibrato, and the whammy bar, Trower injects the notes with a passion and clarity that, for this listener, has no comparison.  Robin Trower remains my all-time favorite-SOUNDING guitar player.<br /><br />With guitar tone this good, pretty much any songs would be worth hearing - but what makes this album so special is that Trower delivers his best collection of killer riffs to go along with the glorious sound.  &#34;Day of the Eagle&#34;, &#34;Too Rolling Stoned&#34;, the title track, &#34;The Fool and Me&#34;, &#34;A Little Bit of Sympathy&#34;, &#34;Lady Love&#34; ... these are all classic rockers, covering a range of tempos and grooves.  Lyrically, the fare is never less than solid, and &#34;Day of the Eagle&#34; resonates as well today as it ever did, an anthem for the peace-seeker forced to live in a tumultous world.  We are still &#34;living in the day of the eagle, not the dove.&#34;<br /><br />When I was getting into Trower, I picked up the excellent &#34;two-fer&#34; reissues.  But this disc is worth getting as well, because it includes a live recording of a five-song promotional gig the band played to support B.O.S.'s release.  As great as Trower sounds in the studio, I've always enjoyed his live work even more, and these five live cuts do not disappoint.  They are worth the price of admission.<br /><br />If you've never heard Robin Trower, you've never heard how good a guitar can sound.h the price of admission.  If you've never heard Robin Trower, you've never heard how good a guitar can sound.
1558908374|5.0|101 Dalmatians is simply my favorite movie of all time. Funny plot and loveable charcthers and great rated G horror movie. I was very young when I saw \\"101 Dalmatians\\" in 1996 and I was So scared of Cruella but, that is sort of a good thing because Glenn Close's proformance is so great and that is what I look for in a movie. Almost 10 years later, \\"Dalmatians\\" is still fresh and great. One thing I have a problem with is the price for the DVD. Even though I love this movie, Im not going to pay that price. Great movie way awful DVD price.    Summary: Anita {Joley Richardson} and Rodger {Jeff Daniels} are from two totally diffrent worlds. The only thing they have in common is they own Dalmatian dogs. Anita is a fasion designer and Rodger is a video game designer. They meet when thier dogs, Pongo and Perdy find eachother in the park. Rodger and Anita meet, fall in love and marry. So happily eaer after right? WRONG! Anita's boss Cruella Dev il{Glenn Close} happens to love fur and her favorite kind is dalmatian fur. With the help of two henchmen Horace and Jasper, Cruella plans to steal the 15 puppies that belong to Pongo and Perdy. The dogs will get even and that results to a happy ending.     If you have young children I reccomend the 1961 animated movie.  The animals talk and Cruella is less scary. Please wait untill your kids are older before viewing this movie. If your going to buy this movie, buy the VHS or wait untill hopefully, the price of the DVD goes down. What would please me would be a 10th anneversery DVD with lots of extras and for it to be reasonablly priced. Check out the sequel to this movie \\"102 Dalmatians\\", although it might not be as good as this it's a fair sequel.    Taylor Hodgkins 2/20/06

B0000VAFO0|1.0|According to Jeff Shannon, he says that Underworld is a way better movie than Van Helsing but according to Jesse, he says Van Helsing is a way better movie than the Underworld franchise. <br />After watching this movie, I debated on which was best with Jesse. After a long debate and long hours of debating, we both shared our point of views and we both agreed on which movie was best and to no suprise it was Van Helsing. Jesse says that Underworld has crappy special effects, which really does and he also says that the movie has a boring plot and that it reeks of boringness and that it should not be released on DVD and I agree with him all the way. This movie is a sham and who ever wrote this script should be a shame of him self for writting a crappy script and who ever decided to release it in theaters is real crazy and off his head. Stay away from this movie and buy Van Helsing for it's better movie than this crap!! <br /> <br />p.s. Evanescence is also crappy and Amy Lee can't sing also and she ain't hot and Linkin Park is also crappy says Jesse.

0743243153|2.0|\\"Life is difficult\\", is M. Scott Peck's opening statement to \\"The Road Less Travelled\\". Well, duh.<br /><br />Peck is a psychiatrist. He is also a born-again Christian who has found salvation in religion. In this book he seems to be trying to create a new kind of therapy which is a fusion of religion with psychiatry, which sometimes leads him into some very muddled thinking which could possibly be detrimental to the patient.<br /><br />The book is organized into four sections: Discipline, Love, Growth and Grace. In Discipline, Peck emphasizes the necessity of living a disciplined life compared to a disorganized one, doing what you need to do when you need to do it instead of living for the moment for the gratification of your own whims and humors. Sound advice which hardly needs repeating. A selfishly disorganized life with yourself at the center of your own personal universe creates mayhem for everyone around you. Not a good idea.<br /><br />Section 2 is about Love, which Peck feels is the driving force behind Discipline. One lives a disciplined life not only for one's self, but to provide nurturing and stability for those whom you love and who depend on you. Giving part of yourself to other people helps to build their spiritual growth as well as yours.<br /><br />So far, so good. But in Section 3, when he discusses Growth and Religion, and in Section 4, when he writes about Grace, Peck muddies the waters up. Peck insists that self-awareness and religion are one and the same; since everyone has some understanding of himself (a shaky premise in any event), everyone has religion, and it is incumbent upon everyone to use religion to facilitate their personal growth. And in Section 4, he expands on this by saying that our personal growth must be assisted by a higher power other than our conscious will; i.e., there can be no personal growth unless we subjugate our wills to God's.<br /><br />Peck has incorporated a good deal of Erich Fromm's ideas about \\"malignant narcissism\\" as a factor in emotional illness. Reduced to its fundamentals, this means people are out of sync with emotional health if they willfully refuse to accept a higher power as pre-eminent. He expands on this a great deal more in \\"People of the Lie\\", his study of human evil. What Peck appears to be saying in \\"The Road Less Travelled\\" is that everybody will be just fine once they subjugate their own will to the will of God. Otherwise, forget it.<br /><br />This, of course, raises the question of how are we to know the will of God? It's always struck me as the most mind-blowing arrogance that anyone can state what is God's will. But Peck apparently has no problem with this. He's perfectly comfortable with this concept, just as he conveys the impression through this book that in the patient/therapist relationship the therapist holds a god-like position and that if therapy fails it's because the patient refuses to subject his own will to that of the therapist. Please. As a mental health professional, I've seen enough successful and unsuccessful therapy to have learned that failure in therapy is not always the fault of the patient and there are some therapists out there who shouldn't be practising. Peck's unloading responsibility for failure of the therapeutic process on the patient is blatantly unfair to the patient and could produce a lot of unnecessary guilt in the patient. It also neatly absolves the therapist from any responsibility for the failure of his treatment.<br /><br />Peck gave me a genuine \\"WTF\\" moment in the first edition of \\"The Road Less Travelled\\", when he stated on page 175 of his book that he would have sex with a patient if he thought it would be beneficial to the patient. Whoa! No way. He didn't really say that, did he? I blinked, read it again, and almost hit the floor. (After the inevitable controversy, he said he would remove it from subsequent editions of the book.) I was still shaking my head in disbelief for ten minutes afterwards, wonderinghow in the world could any reputable psychiatrist believe that a sexual relationship with a patient, which is generally recognized as so damaging to the patient that it is grounds for disciplinary action in almost every state in the union (usually suspension of the therapist's professional license) could possibly help the patient. But this illustrates the fundamental problem of Peck's difficulties in observing the traditional boundaries of the patient/therapist relationship, when he attempts to inject a religious component into treatment. It's one thing to hold deeply religious views, and Peck is certainly entitled to his. It's another thing altogether to foist these views off onto the patient under the guise of psychotherapy, and then hold the patient responsible for the failure of treatment if the patient does not accept the therapist's religious views.<br /><br />What Peck has presented us with here is basically a \\"feel-good\\" book for people searching for easy answers to life's problems. It's been said in other ways, such as \\"Let go and let God\\", and through the Serenity Prayer (\\"Lord help me to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference\\"). But these have an element of humility in them that is missing from Peck's book. By the way he has injected religion into therapy, Peck appears to be saying that he has found all the answers to life's problems through religion, and too bad for anyone who refuses to do the same.<br /><br />Sure, life is difficult, as Peck so glibly states in the beginning of his book. The problem is that Peck wants us to think he's found all the solutions. If Peck had been able to keep a better balance between his religious faith and his psychiatric practice, he would have produced a much better book. When he mixes the two up to the point that you can't tell where one ends and the other begins, the book degenerates into one more religious tract, presented as a self-help book. If you're searching for superficial answers to life's problems, you may find some here. If you're looking for real answers, you will already have realized (or will, at some point down the line) that no book, including this one, can give them to you.<br /><br />Judy Lindt believe that a sexual relationship with a patient, which is generally recognized as so damaging to the patient that it is grounds for disciplinary action in almost every state in the union (usually suspension of the therapist's professional license) could possibly help the patient.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|This is a wonderfully personal album by a man who lived life to the full and who has met his demons face to face and still gone on to create some truly remarkable music. The first thing that strikes you on this record is Johnny Cash's unmistakable voice; a little older, but boy it's dark, deep and mellow. The second thing is the unusual choice of songs. They all work. This is a marvellous achievement. 'Sam Hall' sounds as fresh as if Johnny had recorded it 25 years ago. 'Hurt' is simply brilliant - made even more so by the video. I think we have all known for a long time that Johnny Cash would leave us a musical legacy, but his last four albums (and this one in particular) has raised him from an influential country singer, to that of an American musical icon. We would do well to look back at what Johnny achieved in his lifetime. This album is a fitting testament to that ability to deliver, even in the face of adversity.
B000BYA5GO|3.0|This movie is \\"Blow\\" and \\"Good Fellas\\" meets \\"Best Defense.\\"   Like \\"Blow\\" and \\"Good Fellas\\" we are treated to the life of an unscrupulous dealer, but in this case it's arms and not drugs.  Like Johnny Depp and Ray Liotta, Nicholas Cage is likable, although thoroughly self-centered and motivated by purely by money and the thrill of the deal.  This is a good movie in that we get a inside view of arms dealing from the 1980s through the new Millennium, but there is nothing new here that wasn't explored in \\"Blow\\" or \\"Good Fellas.\\"  In other words, there are really no surprises in the family breakups or tragedies that surround Cage's character. <br /> <br />I'd recommend, but don't expect anything different from other movies in this genre.  <br />

He lied, plain and simple!  Don't give him any credit he doesn't deserve!  He is becoming rich off a lie!  Stop buying his book!
0789723107|5.0|Since the very name this book told me that it was exactly what i was looking for. My bussiness consists in coordinate graphic designers, programmers and others to build any size of web sites; and in the middle im the one who designs the skeleton or structure of my clients web sites, so this book is giving me very much of what i need to make a better work. <br /> <br />In some cases it just put words to some of my toughts, but in others it gave me a different point of view for arroneous opinions i had, but not told me so, it showed me why my opinion was not rigth. <br /> <br />So i recomend widely this book to anyone who's work consists in developing web sites.
0452282152|5.0|This book keeps you interested in details, without going overboard. Didn't want it to end! Soooo much better than the movie.
0670034711|5.0|I read a condensation of the \\"Italy \\" portion of this book in this month's (March '06) Oprah magazine and went out and bought the book which entirely lived up to the promise of the article.  Readers of \\"O\\" might have also noticed another hilarious piece by Gilbert in the January issue (I think) about her lack of a sense of direction.  She's a very charming and pleasant companion on what turns out in this book to be a very difficult and soul searching year.  If you think you might be interested I recommend checking out the magazine article first.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|OK - you have to \\"get\\" Napoleon Dynamite to think it's funny.  But - it's become my latest barometer to determine if people are cool or not.  This movie is hilarious, well filmed, well-acted and amazing fun to watch with new people (even the director's commentary is a lot of fun).  If you don't wind up quoting this movie... ...if you don't recognize people who were in highschool with you... ...well you just weren't paying attention in highschool!
0143034901|4.0|Zafon has woven a compelling story about one boy's obsession with stories and books.  The story set in Barcelona ties the stories of multiple characters together in the protagonist's attempt to unravel the mysteries surrounding a novel which he falls in love with when he finds the book at the age of eleven.  All of this leads to a thrilling read.  In the end the novel is an escapist pleasure.  However, it lacks a certain depth in theme.  Zafon seems on the cusp of making some profound observations about reading, love, and fate, and then falls short.  What he does do masterfully though is tell a great story and that is worth the read.
B000000OA6|5.0|It's too bad that this was the last album made while Freddie was still alive because the material on this was their strongest in years.  Throughout the 80's they produced some catchy and likeable pop/rock singles but their albums as a whole were weak, especially when compared to their classic 70's albums.  This album is a masterpiece from beginning to end, with one strong exception (sorry Freddie but I just can't get into a song about a cat).  The only other thing that would have made the album better was if the \\"Queen Rocks\\" version of \\"I Can't Live With You\\" was on here instead but the version here is okay.  \\"Innuendo\\", \\"Slightly Mad\\", \\"Days Of Our Lives\\", and \\"Show Must Go On\\" are the standout tracks and are among the best songs the band has ever created.  This album HAS to rank up there among the best they've done, if not THE best. <br /> <br />Here are my song by song ratings on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the best: <br />1.  Innuendo 5/5 <br />2.  I'm Going Slightly Mad 5/5 <br />3.  Headlong 4/5 <br />4.  I Can't Live With You 3/5 <br />5.  Don't Try So Hard 4/5 <br />6.  Ride The Wild Wind 4/5 <br />7.  All God's People 4/5 <br />8.  These Are The Days Of Our Lives 5/5 <br />9.  Delilah 1/5 <br />10. The Hitman 4/5 <br />11. Bijou 4/5 <br />12. The Show Must Go On 5/5 <br />
B000BM6AVA|5.0|One of my favorite bands.  Of course i have never seen myself listening to hard rock, cause i usually listen to bands like green day and sum 41.  But now my favorite band.  The only song on this album that i didnt like was shes like heroin.  Not the best song, but still ok.  SOAD is one the best rock bands in the world with sick beats and guitar riffs and great choruses.  <br /> <br />Hypnotize-5 stars-great song <br /> <br />Vicinity of Obscenity-5 stars-very funny and sexual <br /> <br />Kill Rock 'N Roll-4.5 stars-good song <br /> <br />U-fig-5 stars-great chorus and singing <br /> <br />She's like Heroin-3 stars-not that good.  Pretty wierd. <br /> <br />Lonely Day-5 stars-awesome song.  One of my favorite. <br /> <br />Attack-10 stars-The best freakin song. <br /> <br />Dreaming-5 stars-another great song. <br /> <br />Stealing society-5 stars-hard to get used to when you first hear it. <br /> <br />Tentative-5 stars-good song. <br /> <br />Holy Mountains-5 stars-Another one of my favorite songs.  <br /> <br />Soldier Side-10 stars-One of the best songs.  Very spiritual.
0307276902|4.0|I purchased this book before the hubbub with Oprah.  It's a fast read, and enlightening, even though it's been proven NOT to be total truth.  I'm NOT fond of all the language, but the style is mesmerizing and quick to read and understand where an addict is coming from.  I'm not sure a \\"memoir\\" needs to be all truth, but I think the public expects the truth in such a book.  Too bad he had to elaborate---his style and story would have worked fine alone!
0553801503|4.0|all of the magical stuff is lacking from this book.  it bogs down a little in the political intrigues and is not as exciting as the rest of the series has been.  hold of buying till the cheap paper back comes out and read it back to back with the next one which the author promises will have all of the more enticing characters in it.    still...it is a four star book...i just got used to five star from this author.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I think this dvd is perfect example of gilmour's talent and musicianship outside the context and smoke and lasers of the Pink Floyd stigma.  In this minimal  environment it was refreshing to see his true gift for music shine on.  We can only hope that this could spur on a bigger and more consistent solo career from him outside of the Pink Floyd identity. We as his fans deserve the treat to hear new stuff from him and he could only continue to grow and soar to a higher musical ground.  I have always felt that even though Pink Floyd was so successful iconic and great, that it did kinda block a truer essence of David Gilmour and that he sacrificed his individual artistic identity for years in the name of Pink Floyd. Perhaps he wants it this way. Who Knows?  In this performance, his voice has a amazing softness and character. his guitar feel is amazing as usual and his demand for the best arrangements and technical sound makes this video a very high quality musical experience and to top it off it was great to see Michael Kamen on stage. His back up choir, amazing as well.
0812975219|4.0|Instead of trying to sum up the book, which previous readers have accomplished in a way that I couldn't equate, I thought I could give some excerpts worth remembering:<br /><br />\\"`Never ask a man if he is from Sparta: If he were, he would have let you know such an important fact - and if he were not, you could hurt his feelings.' Likewise, never ask a trader if he is profitable; you can easily see in his gesture and gait.\\"<br /><br />\\"Beware the spendthrift `businesswise' person; the cemetery of markets is disproportionately well stocked with the self-styled `bottom line' people. In contrast with their customary Masters of the Universe demeanor, they suddenly look pale, humble and hormone-deprived on the way to the personnel office for the customary discussion on the severance agreement.\\"<br /><br />\\"There is absolutely nothing wrong with investing `for the long haul', provided one does not mix it with short-term trading - it is just that many people become long-term investors after they lose money, postponing their decision to sell as part of their denial.\\"<br /><br />What characterizes real speculators like Soros from the rest is that their activities are devoid of path dependence. They are totally free from their past actions. Every day is a clean slate.\\"<br /><br />\\"I am not a `native' mathematician, that is, I am someone who does not speak mathematics as a native language, but someone who speaks it with a trace of a foreign accent.\\"<br /><br />\\"The best description of my lifelong business in the market is `skewed bets,' that is, I try to benefit from rare events, events that do not tend to repeat themselves frequently, but, accordingly, present a large payoff when they occur.

B000BEZQ18|5.0|Mr. Santaoalla has captured the sound and rhythm of the Country/Western mood of the 1960's in his sweet songs.  He uses lots of melody, steel guitars, good vocals, and great dancehall feeling.  The main background themes of the movie are cut into different \\"Sound Poems\\" that intersperse the vocals.  It is a joy to listen to, even if you never see the movie.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|i first heard a 15 second clip of Hung Up back in september of 05 and from the moment i heard this i had high expections, and on Novemeber 5th i was not dissapointed. its is my number one CD of all time for several reasons. first of all, its upbeat and makes you wanna dance all through. there is not one song you wont like if you apppreciate music. also this is very different from what is played on the radio stations and its refreshingly good. every song is thoughtful and well writen and doesn't include laffy taffy or such. if you've actually taken the time to read this, you could've listened to the first 30 seconds of Hung Up and by this time the upbeat music should've surged through your body and made you dance. in conclusion, this is a great CD to start the day and pump you up with energy.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is specially for all those futile metalhead critics who need to have their art shoved up their A** for them to notice it. First of all this album is classic and will remain classic whether you like it or not. They came, they saw, and they conquered. Acclaimed by many prestigious figures and magazines(Spin, Rollling Stone to name a few)as one of the best rock'n'roll albums of all time, Nevermind carries enough magnitude and status to shut all your insignificant metal tweeked criticism up. And as far as Mr. Cobain being a guitar hero, anyone can agree that it wasn't a supperb nor complex guitar skill that have made the album unique but the innovative simplicity that it conveyed. This is a magnum opus of sounds and lyrics that stands with all the other great albums of our time.
B00005MP58|5.0|The Pride and Prejudice, BBC series is a thoroughly enjoyable visit to Jane Austen's era. Both witty and romantic one can travel back and look at society at that time, particularly for women. The cast is wonderful, every character accurately portraited (at least where I'm concerned, a hug fan of Austen). <br />Colin Firth is unforgettable as Mr. Darcy and is both incredibly charismatic and sexy, so much so that Darcy/Firth is every womans idea of a knight in shining armour, what we all are waiting for, even in this day and era. You can watch the series as often as you like without ever getting bored and that's quality and entertainment as it should be.
B00009L1TA|5.0|The movie is full of twists and turns, in fact just two minutes before the end there is another twist. This is the beauty of this film. While watching this movie, whenever you try to believe something, it turns out opposite and only to find later that it was not correct either. This one is definitely not the typical war movie. It's not the actions, but the script that keeps the audience riveted throughout the movie, and critics will have a hard time in pointing out for a moment that was boring in the entire run.<br /><br />John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson were average. I mean their performance was as good as any of their other movies. However, the real credit in acting will go to Connie Nielsen. If you have liked the movie \\"A few Good Men\\", you will like this movie too. Highly recommended.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Simply put, this movie is a present. It is simply incredible to look at. No, it's not the quality of Spirits Within but sometimes, I prefer the slightly unrealistic look over Spirits Within (not to say that they wouldn't be able to pull it off either way)! The movie just looks... brilliant, you have to see it to believe it, screenshots can't do it justice. <br /> <br />The game takes place, as you all probably know, two years after FFVII, where Cloud runs a delivery service and lives with orphaned children. Some of the children begin to get a sickness known as Geostigma and apparently JENOVA (from Final Fantasy VII) has something to do with it. The game focuses specifically on Cloud, with Tifa having a huge role and Vincent and Marlene both making pretty large appearences as well. However, the rest of the gang... Red, Barret, Yuffie, Cait-Sith, the whole gang... they're in there, but... barely. <br /> <br />There's a new gang of bad guys that are all specially connected to Sephiroth who makes an appearances in the film as well (he's on the DVD cover, he'll be in the movie). <br /> <br />The action is brilliant, I simply have never seen anything like it. Screw Crouching Tiger, screw the Matrix, House of Flying Daggers, any of those films... you have to see some of these fight scenes to know what I'm talking about. But yes, an hour of fighting in a hundred minute movie leaves room for only about thirty minutes (ten minutes shaved for filler crap that they throw in) of real dialogue, only thirty minutes to develop what is a terrible plot in terms of FF games. That's the only flaw with this film.  <br /> <br />Just sit back, enjoy the action (make sure you've played FFVII since you'll have no idea what's going on then; the backstory explained at the beginning won't help much), listen to the BRILLIANT soundtrack composed by Nobuo Uematsu (highly suggest picking up the soundtrack as well) and you'll have a great time.
B0000640SA|5.0|please watch this movie, it is very well-written, well-acted, and entertaining as well. it has a lot of clever and detail-ridden \\"reverse punchlines\\" as well as suspense--it's intencity in ten cities
0670034711|5.0|I loved Gilbert's book and I loved the Bali characters whom I know  a few of. I thought that Gilbert described the expats' life and their relationships with the locals and the Balinese community with fairness, accuracy and lots of humour. I thoroughly recommend Eat, Pray, Love to any man who wants to know a bit more about women.  Great book, great read...

B00000IQW3|5.0|It was on a level with Tron in the quality of computer graphics, before computer graphics was affordable for films. Some sequences in the movie were computed on Cray super computers which cost millions of dollars to run and cool.<br /><br />These days nobody actually renders 8000 lines to film (for instance Bugs Life used something like a monte carlo sampling at 1200x1600, and was the first ray-traced film from Pixar).<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it contains one of Robert Preston's (protagonist of \\"The Music Man\\") last performances.<br /><br />The story in a nutshell: trailer-park boy plays video game well, video game machine is really a recruiting post for an intergalactic federation, boy gets selected to protect earth from evil empire.<br /><br />The dream of the movie is that the video games people played (in the 80s) might secretly be recruiting posts for intergalactic wars/adventures. Some movies were like this, such as \\"War Games\\" was about a kid who could use his computer to start world war three. \\"Cloak and Dagger\\" was about a kid obtains a game cratridge that secretly contains blue prints for a weapon. \\"Labyrinth\\", \\"Never-ending story\\" and \\"Time Bandits\\" follow a similar theme of a non-technical nature.
0895260131|1.0|Its unfortunate that Islam is so misunderstood and misrepresented. I totally understand that the behaviour of some muslims today does not help clear up this misrepresentation.<br /><br />But their behavior itself is part of a larger frustration.<br /><br />Instead of providing a solution to the problem the author<br /><br />has gone in a journey of finger pointing, demonizing the muslim population and has indirectly suggested their mass state sanctioned persecution. Great. we have come along way since WWII.<br /><br />Its sad that people rely on these types of authors to seek understandings. The author appears to considers his audience very elementary and not being able to do research. I guess these are the kind of simple minded books that people like nowadays as oppose to taking an analytical/academical approach towards gaining unbiased knowledge.<br /><br />If one has an agenda to make a religion look bad, how difficult do you think it would be to write a book to demean the Pope or Jesus or Hinudism for that matter. How about if someone wrote a book titled: \\"The true face of the Catholic church and it promoting Pediphiles\\". Surely that would be inaccurate and disrespectful and Totally untrue. Why do you tolerate the same injustice with the Islamic religion?<br /><br />This book offers no solution whatsoever,<br /><br />other than saying that Almost two billions muslims are totally misguided. Here is only one note of many notes about Jihad in Quran. I guess the author of this book overlooked it.<br /><br />During first years of Mohammad's prophethood, for 13 years Muslims did not have permission to fight back and defend for themselves from the Arab pagans. After 13 years of being persecuted and killed for simply practicing their monolithic faith, Allah (God) permitted them (Muhammad and his followers) the (Jihad) fighting but He did not make it obligatory. He said:<br /><br />Permission to fight is given to those (i.e. believers against disbelievers) who are fighting them (and) because they (believers) have been wronged, and surely Allah is Able to give them (believers) victory. Those who have been expelled from their homes unjustly only because they said:\\"Our Lord is Allah.\\" (V.22:39,40).<br /><br />(Note: Allah is God of Ibrahim, Moses, Ezra, Jesus, Noah and many other messengers of God)<br /><br />The above Verses clearly state that He (Allah) is Able to give victory to His worshippers (the believers) without fighting, but Allah wants from His worshippers obedience with all their efforts.m (and) because they (believers) have been wronged, and surely Allah is Able to give them (believers) victory.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|Dream Theater are a musical anomoly. I believe it is repeating this article of truth that one needs to put this disc into their cd player. The first, and most obvious thing about this album is that it is a touch (a touch?) heavier than previous releases. Unfortunately, that seems to be enough for a lot of people to form an opinion of the album. But it is only when you delve further that you truly discover what the magic of Train of Thought is. Here are just a few of my thoughts on what I consider a brilliant album: <br /> <br />The album opens with what I would describe as a pretty conventional, not bad just conventional, track. As I Am probably fits the classic sense of a rock song closer than anything recorded by DT up until this point. There are some famtastic displays of chops metered with remarkable conrol and retraint by all instrumentalists. <br /> <br />This Dying Soul is a great piece of music, from the layered guitar harmonies to the complexity of the changes within the song. On this track Petrucci shows the value of playing a measured solo over firing off 16 notes per beat. Even during the solos no member of the band becomes bigger than the rest, resulting in the PERFECT band arrangement. But the album only gets better... <br /> <br />Endless Sacrifice is fairly similar to This Dying Soul. I am not too sure whether this was intended or not, but knowing DT it was! I don't mean that they carry the same melody or lyrical content or anything like that, just that when I think of those songs I automatically think of them as a pair. (Probably Live at Budokan's fault!) <br /> <br />Honor Thy Father is the only track that I truly consider weak on the album. I really enjoy the verse because it is so different to anything I've ever heard from these guys. (Bit like Tool almost?) Therein lies the potential that the song had. Where the song falls down is with a poor chorus. Even the break between the verse and chorus is something akin to hitting a brick wall, or changing the disc halfway through a song. There does not seem to be any logical movement between the verse and chorus. Anyway enough about that track. <br /> <br />From here on the album more than recovers with the last 3 tracks being my favourites on the album. <br /> <br />Vacant is a haunting piece of music complete with cello to really paint a dark picture. The impressive working of the melody on the piano is done to perfection by an ever-magnificent Jordan Rudess. It only become truly impressive upon hearing Stream of Consciousness when you realise that they took the 5/4 melody from that and turned it into a 6/8 (which I'll admit is pretty difficult to hear until you hear the give-away swing of compound time that James La Brie's voice gives it.) <br /> <br />On Stream of Consciousness James gets a break and the instruments go to town! This is for me the most impressive track on the album. In classic DT fashion it moves from time signature to time signature (at some points 3 measures in a row can have 3 different time signatures!) The highlight of the piece is Jordan's classically-inspired solo at the end of the song into his harmony with John Petrucci who's tone is as always nothing short of beautiful. <br /> <br />In the Name of God is GRAND. This is what prog rock is. (OK maybe a little heavier than most but the elements are all there!) As proven on Live at Budokan this is the song to close a concert with. The technical chops shown by John, John, Mike and Jordan are mind-numbing! In this context the highlight of the entire album is the solo jam at around 9 minutes with Jordan and John P trading extremely fast licks (John ripping out serious tremelo picking, and Jordan growing an extra 5 fingers to play at that speed!) All the while John M and Mike are locked into their funky (not too technically challenging but still a fantastic display of rhythm section dynamics) groove and don't miss a beat. <br /> <br />Each musician's performance on this album is HUGE. It is easy to see James, John P. and Jordan's contributions because they are evident, but this in no way means that Mike and John M. had a smaller role to play. Myung's bass playing is something phenominal. His ability to lock into a groove yet still play lines that create beautiful countermelodies is unbelievable. Mike can play any time signature as though it was a basic 4/4. In Stream of Consciousness you almost can't detect the obscure time signatures since he just plays through them beautifully (and never steamrolls his way through them as so many drummers can be guilty of in those circumstances.) <br /> <br />In conclusion this is an album by a band that streches itself more with each album they release (One song can be more adventurous than other well-known bands will be their entire careers) This album is a must for anybody who wants to experience a band that is never content to rest on its laurels. As I finish this review the CD rips into the jam at the end of \\"In the Name of God\\" so the last thing to be said is that this album can only be experienced by owning it and not by reading my review - so why are you still reading? Go get it!
0792165020|5.0|The original source for the screenplay of The Talented Mr. Ripley comes from the American novelist Patricia Highsmith who is known for her psychological thrillers including her infamous Stranger on the Train, which Hitchcock brilliantly adapted in 1951.  Highsmith's upbringing was bordered with strained and difficult relationships, as her parents divorced shortly after her birth, she had a strong hatred towards her stepfather, and a love-hate bond with the mother.  Shy, withdrawn, and eccentric were some of the characteristics that followed her mysterious life style.  Yet, there were several rumors flowing around her that indicated that she was gay.  However, she remained single throughout her life while preferring the company of animals.  With this in mind and her early interest in psychology, it is easy to see how she can create a gentle, caring, and passionate psychopath such as Tom Ripley.<br /><br />The first book that Highsmith wrote about Ripley was the Edgar Allan Poe Award winner The Talented Mr. Ripley, which was followed by an additional four adventures.  The first cinematic adaptation of this book came in 1960 through Plein Soleil directed by Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment with Alain Delon cast as Tom Ripley.  Almost four decades later director Anthony Minghella returns to the first book of Ripley to which he applied the lengthy title The Mysterious Yearning Secretive Sad Lonely Troubled Confused Loving Musical Gifted Intelligent Beautiful Tender Sensitive Haunted Passionate Talented Mr. Ripley.  The many descriptive adjectives of the complete film title provide much for the audience to ponder about Tom Ripley's persona.  However, viewing of the film will answer some of these questions while it will certainly instigate additional bewilderment.  Yet, the concisely brief title The Talented Mr. Ripley offers equally much mystery, as its lengthy companion.<br /><br />The opening montage opens with an ominously sounding lullaby that accompanies the sharply edged and fragmented imagery of Tom Ripley (Matt Damon).  His face emerges fractured similar to the reflection of a broken mirror, which symbolically might suggest a hint of Ripley's broken persona.  Simultaneously, the dawdling lullaby's agonizing lyric echoes in the background through the words:<br /><br />\\"From the silence, from the night,<br /><br />comes a distant lullaby.<br /><br />Soul surrendering your soul,<br /><br />the heart in you not whole.<br /><br />For love, for love, walked out,<br /><br />cast into the dark,<br /><br />branded with a mark,<br /><br />of shame of Cain.\\"<br /><br />These poetic words bring about the notion of jealousy from Cain's slaying of his brother Abel, as God preferred Abel's sacrifice to his gift.  It also reflects upon the punishment God threw on Cain for killing his brother, as Cain was doomed to wander the earth for an eternity.  Analogously, it presents a strong indication of Ripley's meaningless and aimless existence, as he seeks something better that he finds in the Greenleaf family through maybe wealth, status, elegance, culture, love, belonging, and more.<br /><br />Eventually, the opening montage bridges into reality through Ripley's flashback voice-over-narration explaining how he wished he could erase his actions of the past by not having borrowed a jacket.  This, as the final verse of the ill-omened lullaby pours out over an aristocratic audience on an extraordinarily blossoming terrace facing over the New York's Central Park.  The borrowed jacket that Ripley refers to has a Princeton crest on the chest, which Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) recognizes.  Assumingly, Mr. Greenleaf believes that Ripley is an alumnus of the prestigious Ivy League university where his son Dickey (Jude Law) also attended, while Ripley simply borrowed the jacket in order to fill in for an injured pianist.  An interesting notion emerges here, as the audience will undoubtedly assume that Matt Damon's character is Ripley, but for all that theaudience is allowed to learn, Ripley might only be the assumed alter ego of the pianist whom he pretended to be at the party.  Thus, it is interesting to know that Ripley's true identity might never have been revealed in the beginning.<br /><br />Instead, Ripley (if this is his true name) works as a bathroom attendant at the New York City Opera where he constantly faces the upper classes lavish wastefulness and their taste in the finer things of life.  After having worn the Princeton jacket, Ripley has an invitation to meet with the prosperous shipbuilder Mr. Greenleaf, which allows him a chance to reach the things he much desires.  It also brings him to Italy where he is supposed to convince Dickey to return home.  The trip leads Ripley into a completely new life style without responsibilities and a lot of squandering.  In Italy, he also meets Dickey's fianc&eacute;e Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow) and the lone traveler Meredith Logue (Cate Blanchett).  Everything seems far better than he expected, as he carefully manipulates his way into Dickey's world by becoming his confidant.  It comes to a point where the friendship begins to turn into sexual overtones, as Ripley refers to Dickey to look like Superman and in a later scene wants to join him in the bathtub.  Overtly, Minghella enhances the strong emotion within the scenes through carefully planed and symbolic mise-en-scene, which supports the homosexual atmosphere between the two men.  However, when Dickey meets up with an old friend, Freddie Miles (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the honeymoon comes to an end, as Ripley no longer is the focal point of Dickey's existence.<br /><br />Anxiety, emotional soreness, and rejection set Ripley in a new direction where his neediness surfaces along with his fear of loosing what he just has acquired.  Strong feelings lead him into sad and dismal thoughts rippling through his persona, as notions of jealously, aimlessness, and rootlessness emerge.  A rift becomes noticeable through their differences, as Ripley loves the old and traditional while Dickey embraces the fresh and invigorating.  Musically, it is especially obvious, as Ripley worships classical and opera when Dickey is a Jazz freak.  Yet, Ripley desires to mend the fracture between them in order to keep the life he has grown accustomed to, but Dickey has already made up his mind.  In a haze of passion and fear, the slash of an oar blended in blood ends their relationship, which urges Ripley to instinctively make a drastic change to hold onto his ambition of an affluent lifestyle.  It slowly turns into a nightmarish journey for Ripley, as he finds himself cornered and must play his cards well in order to find a way out.  However, complexity of his dilemma rises beyond his imagination, as past and present becomes too much involved with one another.<br /><br />What makes the film even more intriguing is the intricate psychology of the villain Ripley, and much of this rests within Highsmith's rich writing.  However, Jude Law's Oscar nominated character also plays a strong roll into why Ripley appears naively, as Dickie's persona is far from innocent.  Dickie, a sociable smooth talker, appears to have no scruples, as an example, he intentionally seeks the attention of women for a bout in lustful activity without concern for his future wife.  In a way Dickie is a sociopath, as he is deceitful, reckless, and impulsive while also displaying complete indifference when hurting someone.  In a way both Ripley and Dickie are alike, yet they are very unlike.  Ripley has strong feelings for others while Dickie seems to miss them all together with the exception of those for himself.  Through these two characters, the audience meets a fascinating relationship between two men, which turns out to be a lethal affair.<br /><br />In closing, The Talented Mr. Ripley presents a poignantly disturbing tale with a Hitchcockian atmosphere enhanced by its visual and aural elements.  Visually, the film appliesmise-en-scene purposefully in order to elevate the message with the scene, but it also has an artistic component through the use of reflections in mirrors and the framing of each scene.  In combination with the outstanding cast, these visuals become even more potent, as the strong performances elevate the moment within the scenes.  The final scene portrays extraordinary strong visuals that will embed themselves in the long-term memory.  Yet, it is within the aural experience where the film might hide some of its true gems, as play with both jazz from the 1950s and classical music intentionally bring out the personalities of the characters.  It also augments the emotional situations such as when Ripley weeps in the Opera scene.  Ripley cries, because he relates to the main character in the duel scene from Eugene Onegin who is a fabrication of several fictitious heroes.  In addition, the film succeeds brilliantly in capturing the psychological shadows of Highsmith's fictitious villain while it might also suggest that some of her own persona might rest within our talented Mr. Ripley.old and traditional while Dickey embraces the fresh and invigorating.

B0002F7I9Y|4.0|When I heard about Ray Charles passing about a couple of years ago, I was just surprised. I really never knew just how influential and deep his soulful arrangements of great songs have been from his early 50's and 60's days. But, when I found out about some great songs, I just knew his spirit was just alive and well. While I do think it remains a shame that so many of the younger generation seems to be more interested in Beyonce', Jennifer Lopez, Usher, and many other of those manufactured acts. Nevrtheless, Ray's last album does deliver what most of those acts haven't certified, a remarkable duet.<br /><br />Genius Loves Company, the 2004 final original studio album from Ray Charles is a well-recognized assortment of great duet partners from Natalie Cole and Bonnie Raitt, to Diana Krall and Elton John. The album doesn't deliver anything all out fancy, but a straight-forward, simple pop album. The collaborations are really great and deeply soulful from Fever with Natalie Cole, to Hey Girl with former Doobie Brother Michael McDonald, and Diana Krall on the Ray Charles classic You Don't Know Me. Arguably, the record doesn't miss out on anything out of the ordinary, except there just could've been a little more. Still, Genius Loves Company does deliver a mix of old school soul and R&B that is pleasing to any crowd.<br /><br />All in all, Genius Love Company is a remarkable record, and is one of the most unique duets' records ever released. I just hope that the next generation can really get into Ray Charles and his soulful bluesy voice. This is one of the best records I've ever heard from the past few years and it remains a guilty pleasure delight from a man who did let those good times roll.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Mastering: A-<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+
0743243153|5.0|Pound for pound, this book contains more practical wisdom than 99.9% of what's out there. It's a very special gift from Peck to all of us that is worth revisiting when the going gets rough, or even confusing. In its own quiet way it's a radical work, calling into question the basic assumptions of our daily life.<br /><br />The famous first sentence, \\"Life is difficult,\\" appears to be intuitive and obvious. In fact it is not. We seem to believe that life is designed with our comfort and convenience in mind, and that the potholes we encounter are irritating aberrations. Obstacles are the norm, Peck would say, and offer opportunities for growth.<br /><br />His complete deconstruction of romantic love is also welcome, and almost heretical. This fantastically successful myth has fueled the furnaces of art, culture, and mercantile existence for centuries. The definition of love he offers in its place, \\"The will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one's own or another's spiritual growth,\\" is both workable and profoundly challenging, inviting us to view spiritual growth as a lifelong project of daring generosity.<br /><br />Our culture loves the rose but hates the thorn, making Peck's message of hard work, action rather than talk, and commitment refreshing and vital. He points out, quite accurately, that the process of talk therapy is a bold venture with no certain outcome, and that while therapists provide a safe environment it is patients who must venture into the coalmine with only a small flashlight and a big heart.<br /><br />Most uplifting of all is the connection between emotional health and spiritual evolution. In the final section, devoted to Grace, Peck tracks a connection between inner serenity, where the ego is aligned harmoniously with the subconscious and the larger force it swims in, and a desire to be selfless and useful to others.<br /><br />The perfectly actualized human, he maintains, has a very small footprint indeed and would devote as much time and energy as possible to doing the work of God, to being like God. (The challenge of accurately determining what is God's will versus what is human vanity is consciously highlighted.) In a society like ours, so staggeringly self-centered, superficial, and devoted to the cheap intoxicants of materialism, it is easy to see why a book like this is revolutionary and desperately needed.  Thank you, Dr. Peck.g the work of God, to being like God. (The challenge of accurately determining what is God's will versus what is human vanity is consciously highlighted.)

B0002OERI0|4.0|I don't care about what all of the jaded Dookie fans have to say about this album, I loved it, but it is true, this ISN'T the Green Day on their previous albums.      Like I said, this isn't Green Day, this seems to be a different band resembling...ugh...Good Charlotte a bit.  The songs are very overproduced for Green Day, and the background music writing bordered on mediocre.  Billie Joe Armstrong's lyrics were probably as brilliant as they have ever been once you LISTEN to the music instead of say, \\"Oh my god, this isn't Green Day, I'm gonna go slit my wrists while I listen to Dookie.\\" get over it already, music is changing and Green Day has just become a victim of it.    Call me a little American Idiot poser, but I LIKED THIS ALBUM.  The lyrics were very good, and the songs are great power pop/pop-rock songs, and please buy this album before you base how much you hate it on their singles like American Idiot (catchy song, 3 stars), Holiday (poetry, a bit too long), BOBD (somewhat good, somewhat annoying), WMUWSE (MEDIOCRE, sappy), Jesus of Suburbia (good pop-rock song, long, but the lyrics are probably some of the best on the whole CD).  The key tracks are Letterbomb (a VERY UNDERRATED song, it's so good and fast in pace; arguably the best song on American Idiot), Are We Waiting (sounds like a new Green Day instead of a different band), Homecoming (just a great song), St. Jimmy (just very fast and funny to play on drums) and Jesus of Suburbia (very good song that only a few people like).  Just listen to the songs instead of get angry or too excited (I'm sure by now that we've seen enough ten year olds wearing red ties and saying how hot the singer is or how much they hate George Bush).  The biggest problem was the stream of REALLY MEDIOCRE albums released within the niche like Fall Out Boy, Relient K, and All American Rejects,and not to mention, the over excited little kids.   American Idiot is a GOOD CD, but if you're looking for Green Day, you might not find them on this album.  Not punk rock, but great power pop.     The depressed Dookie fan who gave this a \\"no\\" needs to go home and slit his/her wrists.
044024157X|5.0|I have read every John Grisham book out there... and just when you think he won't be able to come up with a story as good as the last book... he comes out with \\"the last juror\\".  In this case, yes it's about a lawyer and a law suit, but so much more at the same time!  This book will definitly make you think, make you fear and make you cry... you'll LOVE IT!!
B000AYEIZY|5.0|Just when the music industry or I should say, \\"the CD buying industry\\" was going belly up, finally some great music to be had.  I was 2, 3, 4, 5 years old when Cream was doing their thing.  I knew I was a baby during trhe wrong time but I was lucky to have seen Clapton live and Jack Bruce live in Ringo's tour. So, this concert was very hard to get tickets for and it never happened -- but thanks to CDs and DVDs in 2006. <br /> <br />This double live CD of Cream's reunion tour of 2005 is amazing.  In a great concert year where we had the Stones, McCartney, Queen with Paul Rodgers, U2 and Sprinsteen, Cream was the icing on the cake!!
B0002OERI0|5.0|When I put the album in my CD player, I wasn't expecting anything too great. Maybe alright. I could tell by the reputation (and the CD cover) that this was a punk rock band, so I wasn't too sure. So I listened to American Idiot. Good beat, good beat. I also liked the message in that one. But when I listened to Jesus of Suburbia, I was completely floored.<br /><br />The passion put into the song is incredible. Verse after verse, line after line, is pure poetry. \\"In the land of makebelieve, they don't believe in me\\". The words are so true. Just as they are those of a true artist. I decided that, since that one was so good, I'd give the rest a chance. I loved it.<br /><br />Whatsername is very nostalgic. Holiday has a good beat and an awesome message.<br /><br />It's just a great collection. I have to say, I was floored.
B000BJS4SU|2.0|I believe John to be a very good live performer but just once I would like him to produce something where a buck or two was actually spent on the sound quality of the production.  Yeah I get that the screaming young girls are all part of the 'experience' but the sonic quality always sounds absolutely horrible. I'm a fan, and all the more as his body of work grows and matures, just give us something that doesn't sound like it was recorded through a microphone smuggled into the concert concealed in the bra of one of his teenage fans.
B0006L16N8|5.0|X&Y is in no way a letdown, as was shown by the band's success at the Brit Awards, winning best album and single. Hopefully, Coldplay will be around long enough to top it.
B00008PW2D|3.0|I am a huge fan of this show and I was excited to get season 5.  Only when I opened it and only found 2 dvds with only 8 shows I was quite disappointed!!  Especially since the season costs just as much as the other \\"complete\\" seasons.   <br /> <br />Aside from being ripped off - it is still a pretty good season. Be warned though - It is very different from all the other seasons.  The girls change.  The focus is not on the girls and dating - but rather focusing on singlehood and the characters analzing themselves a bit more.  Its different.  Something happens to Carrie - She becomes very cynical after her breakup with Adian and Big leaving.  Things change - the focus is on Miranda's baby, Samantha getting over Richard, and Charotte finding love again after Trey.   <br /> <br />Maybe we are missing Big and Adian - as well as the other half of the season.  I recommend getting the season if you are someone striving to own the complete series, as I am.  If not you would probably be better off renting this season.  With only 8 epidsodes it won't take you that long at all!
B0006399FS|3.0|Well. Honestly, I expected more from good ol' U2. I mean, they're classic. They're music from the eighties was so much more...passionate. It hade more depth. This one seemed more like a big show. I did like Vertigo, but I didn't really understand it.<br /><br />The other songs made no sence to me whatsoever, though.<br /><br />Lacking. Not horrible, not the best. Just..lacking.
B00005JOII|3.0|Why all the hoopla for this film? Match Point is a re-packaged Crimes and Misdemeanors.  Crimes and Misdemeanors, however, was a brilliant film more multi-layered, with more complex characterizations and containing the irony and wit of which Match Point is totally devoid. The plot and conflicts are universally recognizable but were drawn to better effect in many classic films of which A Place in the Sun comes to mind. In Match Point the iconography of Manhattan has been substituted for an idealized London; the social divides in both cities are the same, only the buildings and street names have been changed. The actors' performances are serviceable to the plot; no real acting \\"wows\\" here. Woody Allen is probably one of the most literate filmmakers of any period in film history, yet Match Point adds nothing to enhance his catalogue of work. The movie is worth seeing; it's just not as good as its cracked up to be.

B0009HLDFU|4.0|The 2nd disk is by far the best.  Grohl did an awesome job.  This gave me a new appreciation for the Foo Fighters.  I was disappointed at first with not being able to burn the cd but I tried it again and it worked the 2nd time with Nero, it tells you it's copywrited but after I hit OK to acknowledge it started burning it, so now I can keep the original at home and the copy in my car.  That sucks it won't work with iPod, but I would think if you can copy it to a cd, you should be able to copy it onto your computer & if you can do that you should be able to transfer it to your ipod?  i really know nothing about ipods, but there's some food for thought.
0440539811|5.0|Absolutely wonderful book, a work of a true genius. Intelligent, funny, deep, political, philosophical, sexy, profound, you name it. It definately pushed the right buttons for me. Although I rarely have the nerve to read long books, after a hundred pages of this one I was sad because it has \\"only\\" 800+ pages. Probably the best book I ever read. And I read a few.  <br /> <br />A must for anyone interested in: culture of the 60s, conspiracies, the movement of '68, psychology, magic, radical left-wing politics, everything...
1400032717|5.0|This book kept me interested from the first page! It is so amazing how this author was able to write this book from an autistic point of view! The book is narrated by a 15 year old autistic and you spend the book seeing life from his perspective as he is playing detective to find out who killed the neighbor's dog. The math problems amazed me as well as how his mind thinks about such random things! How this author came up with some of the things in this book I don't know, but it truely is well written and a short book that will keep your attention until the vey end!
0143036556|5.0|Diamond finds the ultimate cause of the collapse of many promising civilizations to be due to the unsustainability of the demands of the culture on the land on which it is supported. He describes this in a variety of settings and examples throughout history. The detail is useful and interesting, but doesn't move the story along very quickly, so this book is not as fun to read as GG&S.  <br /> <br />Greenland is an interesting case: the Norse settlers were able to stick it out 500 years, but were eventually defeated by the unsuitability of the land for farming. However, the Inuit were able to last far longer, because they adapted their demands to what was available (fish and ring seals) and developed technology that was much more appropriate to the environment. <br /> <br />Australia is an interesting modern situation: It seems to be good for very little except mining (and tourism - it's a wonderful place to visit), as farming and sheep-raising seem to produce negative net value. <br /> <br />Diamond points out that the political/humanitarian troublespots of the world are essentially the same as the environmental troublespots of the world. His view is that the impoverishment of the land leads to the impossibility of any kind of sustainable activity, giving rise to the occasion for continuing conflict. <br /> <br />His ultimate view of the situation is not completely bleak: Although he believes that we are projected to run into environmental limits on \\"spaceship Earth\\" within the lifetime of his children, he suggests that green consumerism (exemplified by consumers being willing to demand or to pay a premium for certified-sustainably harvested wood and fish) can harness the engines of capitalism towards the ends of sustainable yield. He gives the example of Shell, which has taken a heroicly  environmentally benign approach to some of their oil extraction locations, without apparent financial disadvantage (from a long-term perspective).  With regards to mining: The toxic consequences of mining activity can only be prevented if consumers are willing to pay more for minerals than they do today, and are able to develop analogous certification systems to highlight the environmental harms (or reparation) of the mining process. <br /> <br />I guess the ultimate point he makes is that, from a long-term view, there is never really a trade-off between business interests and environment protection, unless the business involved can \\"cut and run\\". If we understand our responsibility for our planet (and if we don't take care of it, who will?), it is to our economic advantage to make sure, or at least encourage, that business operate sustainably.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I really don't like country music my tastes are more Heavy Metal or R&B but I love Johnny Cash!! I love This c.d. I listen to this c.d. all the time in my car singing along at the top of my lungs. Yeah I'm glad no one can hear me. You can almost feel the emotion in the songs he sings. My favorite songs are When The Man Comes Around, Give My Love To Rose which I have about memorized, Bridge Over Troubled Water yes this better be playing at my funeral !!, Sam Hall, We'll Meet Again ! This is a great c.d. even if you don't like country!!
0307276902|4.0|The book really helped me to better understand addiction. I have discussed it with a recovering addict and he said that he definitely related to the experiences in the book; that they weren't overdramatized.
B00008YJH5|5.0|To me this is such a great record it defies explanation. Everyone who is remotly interested in unique rock music should go and buy this record. Just about every song on this album is great. Gigantic alone makes this record a purchase. You look at when this music was made and it sounded so different than anything elese at that time. Truely belongs in the top 20 greatest rock records of all time.
0307276902|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. I believe we never know exactly how much of a non-fiction is non-fiction. The book allowed me easy access into a world that was unknown to me. It opened my eyes to the harsh lives of many people who are indeed helpless against the ills of the world. We should allow this book to continue to touch people, change the catagory and allow people who are living in these holes the opportunity for help through this great work. Sorry, Oprah but I believe it is not about you, it is about the hurt, harmed, neglected, and forgotten that suffers daily from the evil habit of drugs. Let's get back to talking about the value of the book and not the pride of elite individuals.
6304698623|5.0|A perfect movie for a little girl!! Every girl is a princess. I have watched this movie too many times to count!! I am not a little girl but I feel like one after I watch this movie. I think that it has a great message for girls Believe in yourself, No matter what others say, No matter what others do!! Do what is in your heart, You don't have to be with the mainstream. I think this is a remake the original was made with Shirley Temple but I just adore this movie!!Love it!!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|a unique creativity with simple music, this is absolutly one of the best last year's album, together with Magic Numbers, Secret Machines, Coldplay and Keane. If you like things out of ordinary you might get this one.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Where does the Firefly Serenity get its gravity?  This is one of many engineering/scientific/etc. questions unanswered.  On the other hand, the series premises allow for ANY scenario - e.g., an old-fashioned, wild-west train hoist - of a maglev train.  Or Deep South with a touch of Old England.  The writing is a bit uneven, but when it is good, it is VERY good.  The special effects are superb and I want my own Firefly, even if I don't know what it uses in place of gravity.  Additionally, instead of being offensively violent/sexual/religious/etc., it manages all/any of these with amazing aplomb and interesting twists.
B00005MP58|5.0|I have 2 things to say about this movie. The first refers to Colin Firth and is as follows:<br />I cannot stop watching this movie! Colin Firth is so addictive. Truly this was the part he was born to play. He nailed it. I need a sequel! 6 hours is not nearly enough! I will now endeavor to watch all his movies. (Don't worry, I won't review them!)<br /><br />The second refers to the less important matter of the rest of the movie:<br />This is THE P&P movie. It has a cult following. It follows the book almost to the letter like no movie-from-a-book I have ever seen. It is the fastest six hours you will ever spend on a movie (thank you Jane Austen for a great story!) - and you WILL watch all 6 at once. It's unavoidable! Not only that, you'll watch it repeatedly.<br /><br />I can't, and won't, try to describe the importance and greatness of this movie. I shant waste my time - the rating it has received can do that just fine. However, the acting is superb, the quality of the DVD is excellent, the music and scenery are wonderful. It goes to show how great movies can be, especially those based on well-known books, when care is taken focus on the story and to tell it correctly, not be in a tizzy to fit it within the average idiot's attention span, or to be so engrossed in showing boobs and slapstick that you forget movies can be good without them. Besides, when the story is already popular, there is NO need to rewrite it. It's called PLOT, Hollywood! Give it a try!<br /><br />(...)<br />P.S. Colin!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I had heard a lot about Serenity but I guess I was too burned out by long, boring, corny Star Wars movies.  (And asinine pronouncements about the nature of good and evil from George Lucas).  But now I've seen Serenity and it is much like the early Star Wars.  A little short on special effects but long on characters, excitement, realistic dialog and even laughs.  A bit like real life, actually.<br /><br />I wonder what George Lucas makes of Serenity since it is so, so much better than anything he has done in the last 20 years.
B000301YY8|4.0|James Blunt is a mix in between Coldplay and brit pop. His album is full of pop tunes and soft piano or guitar sounds produced by Linda Perry make it more interested. You're Beautiful is the outstanding and big hit single of him. Though he has more like High, Wiseman or poppy and catchy Goodbye My Lover. Now lately he's been gettin' more airplay as it happened in UK and have a hit on Digital Songs sales.  <br /> <br />All the songs follow a line and since eye-hurting High to beautiful Goodbye My Lover or meditatin' No Bravery the album is composed by many songs that might call out an attention please. Out of my mind or Billy are songs quite weird but still catchin' the point. His lyrics are quite explicable on once and in other are really absurd or even smart wanna be. God knows what they mean.  <br /> <br />A little complain, released the other videos please I'm tired of You're Beautiful. Now back in the UK his image is an attention call and also his very in style of music that is popular in Europe (soft brit pop). Well, either way this album is cool and a really relaxing one. Not outstanding but good into a category that is quite a complicated one (considerin' that brit pop is beautiful but very non-sense sometimes)
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Thoroughly and completely astonishing.  A masterful work of documentary art - the totality of information included, the animations, the narration (by Sir Lawrence Olivier), the still photography, the eyewitness interviews, and the amazing newsreels and home-movie footage collected, from among other sources,the imperial war museum, all contribute to this most staggering of television epics.  I couldn't recommend it more highly, especially in light of the dangerous times our country now faces.
0684833395|4.0|I'm not going to write a long review, as others have done a well job of it. I just like to say, it was just funny from one page to another from beginning to the end.  The whole book reminded me of M*A*S*H with too many Klingers, or, they all seem to be a relative of him.  All trying to get out of warzone as many of their comrades are dying mission after mission.  I can't believe high schoolers are forced to read this?  Sure, it has SAT vocabs strewn all over the pages, but so is sex.  Shrug.
6305079811|5.0|FYI, they did come out with a re-release of this movie, with extras and remastered, etc., but it is PAL tv system only, meaning it won't play on NTSC sets here in the US. Bummer! your best best would be to buy it from the UK (or other Pal system country) then buy the CyberHome CH-DVD 300S player which plays both PAL and NTSC discs for $37 here at Amazon. You'll probably still come out \\"ahead\\".

B0000549B0|4.0|Harvey is solid entertainment.  Although the piece is set in a time that many cannot relate to now--a time that is much more innocent than today, it is well worth the price to have this classic on one's shelf.  The story pulls one in from the start, but slowly at first.  The characters are all well defined and Jimmy Stewart is at his best underplaying the lead.  Some of the supporting cast is very recognizable from other works, but they do their best to make one believe the whole premise.  In this case, seeing is believing.  Enjoy!

B0001GL3K4|5.0|My brother sent me this, telling me I'd enjoy it. He was right. I adored it, and so did my husband. Is it a PERFECT romantic comedy? Well, no. Richard Curtis does a brilliant job with a plethora of stories, but frankly, I'd gladly give up a few to get more screen time for some of my favorites (few of which seem to have been mentioned in customer reviews):<br /><br />1) Keira Knightley as the girl who gets married, then finds out that her husband's best friend, who she believed didn't like her, was head over heels in love with her and trying to hide it. To me, this is the most poignant of all the stories, as she discovers this unrequited passion and he tries valiantly to deal with it, even coming to her house at Christmas with carolers on audio tape so he can let her know he loves her but will not interfere with her marriage. Too sweet for words.<br /><br />2) Laura Linney, the American girl who's loved a colleague at work for years. But her brother, who's mentally disturbed, never lets her alone for more than a few minutes, and she will not put him on hold, even for a man she's really in love with.<br /><br />3) Hugh Grant as the very decent P.M. who thinks he must be nuts to be so attracted to one of his household staff, who is equally smitten with him. How can you not be enchanted by his solitary dance to \\"Jump For Your Love\\" and later, to his offhand comment when he finally has to go door to door on her street looking for her? When a neighbor recognizes him and questions his being there, he says casually, \\"It's a new service. We hope to get round to everyone by New Year's.\\"<br /><br />4) Colin, the over-the-top guy who dreams of being a great stud -- and finds out an English accent works wonders when he goes to Wisconsin and gets EXACTLY what he wants for Christmas?<br /><br />5) Colin Firth as the writer nursing a broken heart whose housekeeper turns out to be the perfect antidote.<br /><br />6) Liam Neeson and his stepson, who both are in need of love for Christmas. Neeson's gentle encouragement of the boy is priceless, and his run through Heathrow Airport to say goodbye to his great love is delightful.<br /><br />Is it perfect? No. With so many stories it's too easy to lose some in the cracks, or for not all to be so interesting. I must be one of the few who found the story of the porn actors worthwhile -- the idea of two people falling in love while simulating sex for a living -- yet courting each other gently and even formally -- I thought was rather moving.<br /><br />But it's tied up brilliantly, with each story feeding into others, a feat that is most difficult to pull off. And in the end, I'd rather give 5 stars for the movie's intentions than diss it. The truth is, it makes you feel good about decent people who deserve love -- and in the end, that's a pretty noble thing for a movie to pull off.<br /><br />In sum, LOVE, ACTUALLY leaves you something both sweet and bittersweet. Love at Christmastime has been done before and will be done again. Luckily, this time it was done really well. Enjoy.tmas.

B0006U4UAU|4.0|I INHALED this CD.  After all the hype and hyper blowin' up about this dance/punk/rock genius, I finally broke down and bought it.  Not that I was old enough to get into the discos in the mid 70's-early/mid 80's(I was still in elementary school, then middle school), but I remember(and still love) the groups that influenced this disc...The Buzzcocks, Heaven 17, PiL, Blondie...hell even the Rolling Stones \\"Some Girls\\" album.  And yes, I have to say(after finding \\"Death Disco-Songs Under the Dance Floor 1978-1984\\" CD and I'm ordering it)the old stuff is more fun.  But for the hipsters who don't know this is not original genre,it's pretty great.  No, it's very great.  The first song \\"Daft Punk is Playing at my House\\" was fun, and both discs made it worth driving through  snowy/sleety/frozen rain covered streets to work out at the gym these last couple weeks.
0670032506|2.0|The book is divided into 52 chapters that repeat basically the same points over and over again. So you have to read through the chapters and try to spot the occasional new idea. It seems strange that a book on productivity makes you waste time gleaning a few good ideas. (Come on, man, if you have 10 pages of good ideas, give them to me in 10.) But then again I guess most books in this genre make you do that. Sheesh.
1582403589|5.0|Excellent story and artwork.  The author really put some thought into the plotline.  He did a great job of using the overall concept to examine other societal issues in a fresh way.  If you are a fan of the zombie genre at all, then you are sure to enjoy this book.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Totally disagree with \\"SkyMac2\\" and anyone else who says you gotta already know the TV series to appreciate this flick.  I didn't; fact, I'd barely even heard of it before  -- and was totally awed from the first 5 minutes, which have got to be one of the coolest intros to any movie ever. <br />This genre-bending, brilliantly witty, moving, exciting, involving and funny trip successfully melds sci-fi and Western conceits, making a story that's not only  exemplary in each field, but transcends both.  It took me right back to that thrill of the exotic & romantic that was first seen on screen in the bar scene in the very first Star Wars, and has hardly ever been equalled in any movie since.  Although nowhere near so grand in scope (obviously; it's not aiming for that), in the seamless creation of a world and characters in whom you can get deeply invested almost immediately, this rivals the LOTR trilogy.  (I know that's saying a lot; I stand by it.) <br />The movie did, of course, totally convert me into a fan, and I've now ordered the Firefly DVD set -- and will somehow need to slow myself down in not watching them all on the first day, since I know there might not be any more to come.  Wotta conundrum. <br />And while it might help to have a liking for sci-fi, I don't think even that is a necessity -- anyone who just likes thrillers of any kind should at least be open to the possibility of not just liking but totally falling for this awe-inspiring work. <br />So there.
0064400557|4.0|A wonderful childrens book that still has the ability to make adults laugh and cry!

1592400876|4.0|I loved the approach this book took to the English language and the many mistakes made by the people who use it everyday.  While not intriguing (it is a grammar book) this book offers an interesting way to correct mistakes that you might be commonly making everyday, or just an interesting read if you like playful puns and jumbled sentences.

1400031524|4.0|In THE DOGS OF RIGA-- both four-legged and two-legged--Inspector Kurt Wallander is back with another difficult crime to solve. Two dead men, dressed to the nines, wash ashore in Ystad in a life raft. As usual, initially there are practically no clues.  This crime takes Wallander away from Sweden into Latvia, a place he finds colder-- if that's possible-- than his homeland. He warms up, of course, when he falls in love with the widow of another murdered character, Major Liepa of Riga. Inspector Wallander remains the character fans of Mankell have come to love. He doesn't always get along with his father and daughter or his police superiors, he on the best of days bends the rules of conducting an investigation, on other days he breaks them, he doesn't eat well, he has trouble with the opposite sex and he's a tad hypochondriacal but still loves opera. Does he sound like someone you know?<br /><br />I found myself not liking this novel as much as previous ones I have read by Mr. Mankell. It may have been that he was writing about locales and people very foreign to him. On the other hand, a B novel by this most talented of writers is better than those of dozens of his contemporaries.<br /><br />As always, Mr. Mankell writes about big issues, in this instance \\"the revolutionary events that took place in the Baltic countries during the last year\\" as he says in a rare \\"Afterword\\" written in 1992. He remains one of our very best crime writers.
B0000V46KY|3.0|This review is for the CD layer only since I don't have a SACD player, and I'll keep it short.<br /><br />This is easily the worst sounding jazz cd in my collection - It sounds like I've thrown a blanket over my speakers. I've never owned this title before, so I can't say with certainty that this is a MFSL problem or a master tape problem, but I can find no complaints about the sound quality of the regular issue in its review section. This makes me think that MFSL botched this really bad. I'd recommend buying the regular issue CD if you're not interested in the SACD layer, otherwise you'll be very disappointed.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I don't know why this Two-Disc Deluxe Edition isn't the one being sold in stores everywhere -- I didn't even realize they had released it yet until I looked for it here on Amazon. <br /> <br />This is a great DVD.  Obviously the film looks great, the transfer is perfect. I'm sure that's the same on the single disc.  It's the extras DVD you're buying here and it's well worth it.  Long segments on things like the design and construction process of the Batmobile (including footage of tests and jumps), or the design and construction of the costume.  Great stuff with on-camera interviews with the director, star, writer, DP, production designer, costumer designer, etc. <br /> <br />It's great, I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br />Buy it.
B000B5UL7G|4.0|If you haven't heard Robbie before, this album is perhaps going to disappoint you. However if you are already a fan of Robbie and know everything about his ups and downs in his music career, you'll love it. <br /> <br />This man has so many faces; he now comes up with an album which is kind of an experience of sorts. It is a sort of travel from evil to divine. Needless to say Robbie sounds a bit philosophical and has certainly matured not just as a singer but also as a songwriter. His association with Duffy has certainly worked wonders for him and may be this album will be the turning point of his once glorious career. <br /> <br />As far as the songs are concerned, they are good and really good. While some songs could have been a bit more \\"decent\\" (in all senses of the word), I guess fans won't complain, coz this man's ultimately the \\"greatest entertainer\\"! <br /> <br />Most certainly a must have for all Robbie fans. You must experience the reserruction this man is undergoing!
B0000013GT|5.0|Outkast have shone with lucidity on this album, all the while showing too that where they come from is never worth forgetting.  By intertwining urban philosophy with masterful storytelling and go-beyond musicality, Outkast has raised the bar on what hip hop can be and how polished it can become without sacrificing it's essential rap flavor.  At times reminiscent of the under-recognized \\"Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em\\" by Erik B. and Rakim, Outkast follows suit with sounds that evolve, sounds so thickly claivoyant that they make a journey into outer space seem superfluous.  While it was of course Erik B. and Rakim who turned rap music from streetcorner hollering to journeys through sound and city life, Outkast took advantage of their uniquely southern stylistics (and some newer big budget production technology) to add another trusty thruster to the now-maligned but once authentic hip hop rocket ship. <br /> <br />The first song to stand up and recognize on ATliens is \\"Millenium.\\"  When Big Boi culminates his turn at the microphone by announcing the immanent threat to hip hop sanctity from shady dealers, and up-and-crummy rap stars, his fatalism is disheartening, but still one feels that all hope is not lost: <br /> <br />When your back was turned, them slackers learned and now we fallin apart <br />You lookin me in my eye, but you ain't feelin me in your heart <br />Yes, yes Lord, give me the power within the final hour <br />These n****z, they leavin me stranded like Rapunzel in the tower <br />Now or never, let's stick together and overcome <br />But they don't feel like marchin, cuz they shoes is overrun <br />Ain't that a b**** <br /> <br />\\"Now or never, let's stick together, and overcome, but they don't feel like marchin cuz they shoes is overrun.\\"  This line alone illuminates the struggle and the contradictions facing anybody who recognizes that the problems they face are never theirs alone.  One senes that Big Boi knows what it takes to protect the game and break thechains, and one can touch his disgust when he recognizes amidst his desperation that the people are too tired to make happen the movement that would save their situation.  Dr, too, hits the very soul on this tune, with lyrics that astonish in their pulsating, vital truthfulness : <br /> <br />Life never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience <br />Expect the worse but now I'm pacin <br />Back and forth, inside, I'm melting like water on wicked witches <br />A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences <br />I had the best of life in my clenches but monkey wrenches was thrown <br />Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem to long <br />I fall asleep before the endin, don't even get to say Amen <br />I hope He understand I be on bended knees <br /> <br />Of a life that can get away, there is no better professor.  But ATLiens is not all truth in philosophy, there is also that storytelling and wheel-spinning urban flavor for which Outkast made themselves know on \\"Southernplayalistic.\\"  And then there is \\"Growing Old,\\" which is by far the finest treatment in hip-hop history of aging and mortality : <br /> <br />see all them leaves must fall down, growin old <br />Fat t**ties turn to teardrops as fat a** turns to flab <br />Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab <br />Trees bright and green turn yellow brown <br />Autumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin old <br /> <br />For Outkast and ATLiens, the cycle of life can be painful, and illusions can crash smack into forces beyond our control, but there is something to be said for the good times that come along the way, and it is only knowledge of the inevitable that brings breathing room to a people who've known what the meaning of difficulty is.

0440237688|5.0|Imagine a world with no hate, injustice or pain. A world of peace, comradery and sameness. This is the world of Jonas, the main character in Lois Lowry's award winning novel The Giver.  <br />Lowry has created a magnificent novel that causes the reader to think about the idea of a utopian society. It focuses on the concept of whether a perfect society is truly attainable, and at what expense. Lowry bravely takes the premise of utopia and shows the reader that a world devoid of emotion is world devoid of both evil and good.  <br /> <br />I found this book to be extremely enjoyable, a true page turner. it is written with such detail that the reader can both feel themselves in the situations at hand and the emotions of the characters. This relatively simplistic book features timeless themes and I recommend it for children and adults alike. This is an excellent book for reading groups,and it is an equally enjoyable personal read. I strongly recommend this book for all those mature enough to comprehend it. <br />
B00004XMTJ|4.0|This DVD was good but not the same as being there.  The most exciting part of the show for me was the first 10 minutes where the theatre goes pitch black and all you see are tons of cats eyes darting up and down the isles making there way to the stage.  The DVD was unable to produce that.  Also, it kept cutting back and forth between different characters so it was hard to stay focused on one area of the stage at a time.  I did like how up close it was and how you felt like you were right on stage with them.  If you have seen the show more than once and want something to watch to recapture the production this is for you.  If you have never seen it you won't know what you are missing so you will probably enjoy it.  Picture and sound were excellent.  I would recommend this also to anyone who is an Andrew Lloyd Webber fan as there is an extra behind the screens special where you get to hear how it was made.

B000BZIT5M|5.0|Owned this stunningly sung Boheme on VHS and now finally it makes its glorious way to dvd. Caught in their absolute prime, Cotrubas and Schicoff are deeply moving as they soar in their musical lovemaking.  A Gem. Sets are wonderfully traditional. No subways, tunnels, interplanetary travel to contend with. Thomas Allen stands out with honors along with Marilyn Zschau to complete an unbeatable quartet.  The Royal Opera House orchestra under Gardelli are an aural treat. Opera on DVD has come of Age and not soon enough. At least grab the opportunity to experience this performance.  It's a Winner! No weak links in this magnificent performance. This production is to DVD what de los Angeles, Tebaldi and your favorite soprano are to audio CD. I don't deny the other great Bohemes available but for me, and taste is always personal, is something very special. Schicoff is one of the most sincere and real of singers and at this stage his voice has a full, rich, ringing timber. Much the same can be said of his fellow performers! Oh, what a gift! And do have a glass of wine at the Cave Momus while in attendance. It will stir your soul! Make it  a ten star vintage while you're at it.
B00005JO04|4.0|I would be less than honest if I were to say that \\"Syriana\\" is a great film.  Good, yes, but by no means great.<br /><br />In brief, \\"Syriana\\" covers several loosely related plots that all ultimately reveal the corruption that is Middle East politics.  The corrupt, the venal and the incompetent seem to win out over honesty and integrity.  It is big oil and the US government and their lackeys that triumph.  It is democracy and transparency that is denied.<br /><br />The cast of \\"Syriana\\" is a true ensemble with stars such as George Clooney and Matt Damon on hand to provide pulling power.  Each actor and their characters are plausible and, at the end of the day, the plot itself is credible.  No one could suggest that Middle East politics is free of the taint of corruption.  Indeed, short of eastern Europe during the cold war or most of Africa today, few examples of corruption could exceed that on hand in the Persian Gulf and its environs.<br /><br />Perhaps the weakest aspect of the film is that it labours its points.  This is not to suggest, as some may, that this is a film with a left wing or anti American bias.  America and others have been up to their eye balls in the politics of the Middle East for over a century.  However, this point, when continuously made, can tire in time.<br /><br />See this film as it does have a contribution to make to any discussion of the Middle East.  Do not dismiss it because some have claimed that it is biased.  It is these people who have the most one eyed views.
B0000AFX64|4.0|This is the 2 hour premiere movie to kick off the series. The special effects are really good for the time. The acting isn't bad and the storyline is good. All in all, if you like good sci-fi & can look at it for the time, I recomend it. It's also good for kids 4+. It's clean, meaning no nudity, no bad language(frack & felgercarb are the words used). And there is no real violence. It's visually captivating for the kids.
0312954468|5.0|I write about books that have touched me. Different eras, different cultures. Ancient Egypt is one of the top subjects I look for, and River God is one of the best example of the genre. It has 2 (so far) sequels, The Seventh Scroll and Warlock - each wonderful. Taita is one of the best characters in a series - His influence is felt in the modern day Seventh Scroll - and back again to ancient times with Warlock.<br /><br />Wilbur Smith is a prolific author and he loves Egypt. I wish he'd continue the magic of Taita in more sequels.
B000AP04FG|3.0|If you want some escapist comedy/action/romance with the two most gorgeous stars in Hollywood than this is the film for you!!  Be careful not to switch your brain on because the writing/editing of this film is a little uneven.<br /><br />However, the performances and filming of Jolie and Pitt are great--it makes you wish for a little more thought into the plot.  The action scenes are too long and the endless repartee between Jolie and Pitt regarding what they don't know about one another would be tiresome if, again, Pitt and Jolie weren't so charming and good at what they do.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|It's so wonderful that \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" with Errol Flynn was given such great dvd treatment.  The copy is excellent. Very clear and bright picture, like seeing the film for the first time.  Plus this two-disc set has plenty of extra features, interviews and documentaries. This is a must have for classic movie fans and Errol Flynn fans alike.  It's a beautiful film , full of adventure  and romance.  Errol Flynn is the definitive Robin Hood, he looks like the real one from the books and acts the part to supreme excellence.  I think Olivia D'Havilland is also the perfect Maid Marian, beautiful, wise, and also kind of shy and fragile as well. <br /> <br />All the supporting cast is excellent as well, Alan Hale and the rest play their roles to perfection and are great as Robin Hood's devoted Merry Men. Basil Rathbone plays Sir Guy to perfection he's really believable as the villen and Claude Rains I think does and equally wonderful job as Prince John.  A really evil but likeable villen. <br /> <br />It has excellent acting , tons of adventure, and great sword fighting and archery scenes.  For new viewers of this film , the color will really impress them, with the lovely forest scenes and beautiful costuming. The archery contest alone is colorful and really impressive.  <br /> <br />This film is definitly first rate and watching it each time is just as exciting as the first.  It's always very interesting and action packed.  I also would like to point out besides the action and adventure the romance between Robin and Marian is very nice too and their are some beautiful  and touching scenes between them.  As in all their films Miss D'Havilland and Errol Flynn really make a believable couple and lovely couple who look very much in love.  <br /> <br />In my opinion no one can play Robin Hood like Errol Flynn. <br />
055321263X|4.0|Though the language is contemporary for its time (1860), and it is written in the style of a serial (thus in the author's interest to make it extend out a bit), this is a good story.  The plot device is quite inventive, the story gets better in the second half, and the final chapters are quite entertaining. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna is the goddess of artist reingineering...once again she has transformed herself and the music to let us know she is the queen of pop no matter her age.  I have followed Madonna since her first album in 1983 (I was 12 at the time)and she has impressed me the easy way she can change her style of music without losing that Midas touch.  I've always tought that Michael Jackson was great at that before running into trouble in the late 90s. <br /> <br />Love her music and hope to hear her for at least another 30 years.
6305882592|5.0|Funny, sad, inspiring...This movie is awesome for the thinking crowd but no thinking is necessary. Soundtrack is all Cat Stevens and has the feel that the songs were written for the movie. Great original story of hope. One of my top ten movies of all time.  Must have.
B0000D96NW|5.0|I liked this album on the first listen, the first 3 tracks blew me away, but it took me a while to get into the rest, but I find that always happens with really good CDs. <br /> <br />The musicianship, songwriting and lyrics on this album are simply top notch. This is what professional musicians should be making, real music! <br /> <br />From the epic opener 'Imperium' all the way through to 'Descend the Shades of Night' Machinehead show you how to make crushing, melodic, inspirational metal! <br /> <br />These guys absolutely rocked me live (my ears were ringing for 3 days!) <br /> <br />Get this CD, you will not regret it! <br /> <br />Note: If you can get the special edition with the bonus track 'Seasons Wither' on it, then do so - that track alone is worth the price of a CD!
0307276902|5.0|This book is amazing.  Regardless of the hoopla of the falseness of this book, for all the haters out there, you are lame and need to get a life yourselves.  I found this book to be very in line with what an addict goes through.  Right on the money, the book was easy to read, I could not put it down, I felt as if I was right there in the scene next to him.  I want to buy this book for everyone I know, I feel like everyone knows someones struggling with drug addiction and this book can cater to the masses and let them see inside what is really going on. James Frey, you are the king and I will read every book you ever write from this day forward, cant wait to start \\"My Friend Leonard\\".  BUY THIS BOOK!!
B00005MP58|5.0|I doubt that I can add much to the already wonderful reviews of this movie.  I have to agree that it is by far, my favorite of all movies, and I like a goodly spectrum.  It is right up there with the likes of Gone With the Wind, and Casablanca.   I particualarly like this version BETTER than the one just out on video from the theaters with Keira Knightly.  I find the characters are easier to get to know and understand better, particularly because more time is spent on developing them.  I am so thrilled by the excellent work of the actors portraying their individual roles.    My favorite is Mr. Bennet.  He is much more personable and we can see his relationship with his daughter much better in this version.  I also just giggle with delight at the utter repulsiveness of Mr. Collins in this version.  He plays this part perfectly and believably.  I think those type of characters are more difficult to portray, but David Bamber does an excellent job.   This version has a different atmosphere than the shorter, newer released version.  The settings and costumes are on a more 'upscale' feel for portraying the more common garb of the day.  If you are trying to decide which version to buy, I am confident in telling you that you would much prefer this BBC/A&E version.  Buy it without regret and ENJOY!!!
0060555661|5.0|Ben Graham is not an easy read. It's even tougher to follow his advice. When Graham wrote his definitive book, mutual funds were for rich people. Times have changed. So, must the investing methodologies. It's fitting that Zweig complements, simplifies and adapts (or at least attempts to) Graham's monumental work. Overall, it's a book that every budding investor should read. Though I am not, an expert investor by any shot, I would suggest every budding investor to read this book, at least once.
068484267X|5.0|The heart of this book is the character of McCourt's longsuffering mother, Angela. I love her response to her sons when they whine (often with good reason, given the extent of their poverty): \\"I'm sorry for your troubles,\\" Angela says. She teaches her sons to weather the storms of life, for she has certainly weathered a few of her own- an alcoholic husband who cannot pay the bills, the deaths of her young children, the humiliation of begging the Catholic Church for charity to sustain her family. Angela was a saint, and McCourt has written this loving story in honor of his mother.  <br />I had heard so many good things about this book that I was actually reluctant to read it. I thought that it could not measure up to the reviews- but it did. McCourt's prose reads like poetry. I encourage the reader to first listen to the CD of McCourt reading Angela's Ashes with his Irish tongue. Also, the movie is NOT a disappointment, and is a \\"must see\\" for those who loved the book.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I went to go see this movie weeks after it had been out and the theatre was still full.  I mean it's not an action movie, a thriller, suspense or even a sci-fi film. No fancy explosions or even fancy dialogue.  However you could hear a pin drop while the movie was playing. The acting was superb, much of the scenery was breath taking. Even had a straight couple sitting in front of me and when the movie was over the husband was crying. His wife slapped his shoulder and told him, \\"See I told you.\\" That and the fact that the owner of the company I work for went to go see it is a true testament to love crossing all boundaries.
B000E1YVZU|2.0|Disregarding all my love for Rent on stage, and all my respect for the actors, and yes, even my loathing of Chris Columbus' directorial attempts, the movie just doesn't work. Shots are so tediously placed to be \\"artistic\\" that it is distracting, and none of the actors really got their chance to show us their characters. There are some excellent parts (Santa Fe) and some terrible ones (What You Own Britney-style music video) but all in all it is mediochre. If you can't see the show on stage, see the movie. But do not judge the show by it. The experience is so different. I wouldn't recommend the movie to anybody unless they know that they will never get to see it on stage. It just feels flat and forced. <br /> <br />Note how Roger and Mark throw their papers into the trash can to heat up their apartment. Then they grab hold of the aluminum can with their bare hands and toss the fire out the window. That is just something useless and distracting. The movie almost gets it right.
0393324818|5.0|After reading this book twice over, I am surprised that Oakland Athletics GM Billy Beane decided to reveal his operations and modus operandi to Michael Lewis.  This is especially since the book exposes some unflattering portrayals of other teams, GM Beane's views on how make trades (illuminating how he operationalizes who to trade for, motivations, tactical and strategic intentions, etc.), organizational management style, which will likely encourage future GMs with Billy Beane's ambitions to keep journalists with masters degrees in economics at shoulder length distance.<br /><br />Lewis's book can be delineated in two parts.  One, a semi-historical breakdown of the rise of \\"moneyball,\\" which is an adaptation of the theories of baseball historian and statistician Bill James.  This is an approach, something we baseball stats geeks call `sabermetrics,' that concentrates heavily on the use of objective, quantitative analysis of baseball talent, based on a faith in statistics, and the privileging of certain statistics (like on-base percentage, OPS [on-base percentage plus slugging percentage], strike-out-to-walk ratios [for both hitters and pitchers]), which supposedly gives baseball executives and managers a better way of assessing players' skills.  Lewis does an excellent job of chronicling the problems that James' quantitative approach experienced in becoming accepted in the mainstream (something I can attest to, since I was one of those who read James' Baseball Abstracts back in the 1980s and remember my own baseball coaches warning in those days against taking too many pitches), how there still exists an old-boys club amongst baseball's elite against moneyball, and how people like Sandy Alderson and Billy Beane helped in breaking down those barriers and employ James' theories on a small market team.<br /><br />Basically, the moneyball approach is a euphemism for the way small market teams like the Oakland A's can stay competitive by drafting smart, expending what resources it has on player development, with a strong organizational encouragement for hitters to concentrate on home runs and on-base percentage (and pitchers to record outs).  In essence, it is a baseball application of the old market investment strategy of buying low and selling high.  You buy low by looking not for the five-tool players all the other teams want.  Instead, you look for the player who may be a little slower, but who has excellent plate discipline, a little home run power, and a pitcher that simply gets people out (without focusing solely on the speed of that prospect's fastball).  You sell high by trading these commodities you've drafted, developed, and allowed to blossom over to large market teams for new talent, money, extra draft picks, and the kind of other resources you can not depend on when your team ranks near the bottom of the league's payroll.<br /><br />The second part of the book is a dissection of the day-to-day operations of the Oakland Athletics under GM Beane.  This includes numerous stories on Beane's idiosyncrasies (he doesn't like watching the games his team plays in), his borderline egomania, and how he utilizes the moneyball approach in the everyday functions of his team--in how the front office judges talent, the manner in which it attempts to manipulate hitting styles on its minor league teams (with a focus on walks for batters and use of other teams' reclamation projects on its pitching staffs), judging minor league talent before the draft, etc.<br /><br />In hindsight, Beane's forthrightness was the most refreshing and surprising part of this book.  It's not every day that you hear a baseball GM declare that they only attended church on Sundays because they were hedging their bets.  The portrayal of the front office of the Mets and Orioles take a hit in this book (with big market teams who constantly trade for overpriced players seen as a cash cow for clubs like Beane's A's).  The draft was also an interesting foray into something that is often ignored in Major League Baseball, as opposed to the extravaganzas that the NFL and NBA drafts have become (this is due in part because the MLB draft is conducted during the season).<br /><br />:Observations:<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent book, although I have one reservation, and that is while Lewis does a remarkable job of illustrating the moneyball vs. old boys club split in baseball, in the process he gives short thrift to the old boys club (again, presumably because of his obvious sympathetic portrayal of the A's and those like-minded believers in the moneyball approach).  However, there are numerous criticisms of moneyball, even from a quantitative perspective, which deserves credit.  For starters, moneyball ignores or does not give much credence to the importance of the fundamentals of the game (such as bunting, base running [since people like GM Beane consider the stolen base to be generally detrimental], and defense [just read the travails of Ron Washington in trying to turn guys like Jeremy Giambi and Scott Hatteberg into a passable fielders]).  Lewis defended the A's post-season ineptitude as a statistical aberration, but you can not ignore how fatal this was for them in the 2003 ALDS against the Red Sox (a series the A's could've easily won had several of its players knew how to adequately field the ball and run the bases).  This does not mean you have to go back to the 1985 Cardinals and the era of small ball to win in post-season play, but you only have to look at the way Eric Byrnes ran the bases in the 2003 ALDS to understand the cost of not stressing your players being able to take an extra base, or at least run them properly.<br /><br />Moreover, by ignoring defense and base running, moneyball underestimates the value of running speed.  As ex-St. Louis Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog notes, running speed is one of those few attributes a player can use on both offense and defense.  This goes into the other big weakness of the quantitative approach in baseball.  While the use of statistics in baseball is pretty effective, albeit not perfect, in measuring offense, it is less than admirable and complete in aptly measuring the value of defense and pitching.  Lewis does try to answer some of this by showing how the A's even attempted to quantify the number of runs it was surrendering by giving up centerfielder Johnny Damon (yes, Red Sox fans, yours is not the only team he's ever played for).  The problem with fielding and pitching, though, is that it is purely dependent on where the pitcher pitches the ball and where the hitter hits it.  Zone Rating may do a good job of measuring the fielder's ability to get to a ball hit in (at least to this point) his fielding zone, but we have yet to solve the problem of who dictates how that baseball arrives there (and how hard or softly that ball is hit in a particular zone, its angle, etc., the kind of information that can possibly skew statistics).  Is the game being determined by the pitcher (at which point pitching statistics become more important) or the hitter?  Moneyball implicitly sides with the hitter, but only because pitching statistics are still rudimentary and dependent on variables with numerous externalities (and with sample sizes that are sometimes much too small and subject to non-randomized circumstances).<br /><br />Still, on the whole, Moneyball is a fantastic book in its in depth coverage of the subjects, Lewis's insider access into the daily lives and workings of a baseball team, as well as knowledgeable explanations of the statistical components to the game (and by extension the moneyball approach).  Also appreciated is that this book shows the rise of a method that was for over two decades outside of the mainstream, but is now every bit a part of the game of baseball (with the A's, Blue Jays, Red Sox, even the hated Yankees, employing fellow moneyball enthusiasts in its front offices).  If anything, one can only wonder about the possible future of moneyball in Oakland, as more teams begin to apply Beane's successful approach, thereby sapping the talent pool of those gems in the rough his organization was so successful at developing over the years.e of statistics in baseball is pretty effective, albeit not perfect, in measuring offense, it is less than admirable and complete in aptly measuring the value of defense and pitching.

B000AADYRQ|2.0|First of all, I would like to point out that I am not a Death Cab \\"hater\\". I enjoy their music, and the words \\"sell-out\\" mean nothing to me. That said, this album is truly an abysmal effort. I made a concentrated effort to enjoy this album, but it came to me that if one has to make an active effort to like what they're listening to, then what they're listening to simply isn't that good.    But I'll begin with the good. Namely, the songs \\"Soul Meets Body\\" and \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\". The former I easily consider among Death Cab's best songs, a truly amazing and uplifting number with Ben Gibbard's vocals at lyrics at their finest. The instrumentation is grand in this track as well, and I've spent a long time addicted to it. The second high-point is \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\", an acoustic ballad sung with a kind of somber nonchalance in the face of tragedy. It is an account of someone's quiet acceptance that they would go to any lengths to be beside the one they love, and a moving song in its own right. Songs like these are why you buy Death Cab LPs...alas, the rest of the album is a more sordid affair.    Frankly, many of the songs showcase nothing but a single instrument playing the exact same rhythm for the entire song, with Gibbard's voice given the full focus. I'll say now that his lyrics and his voice are not enough to carry entire songs. Tracks like the two aforementioned are so special because his poetry and the music complement each other beautifully- with the music taken almost entirely out of the equation, the \\"magic\\" is lost.     \\"Marching Bands Of Manhattan\\" is not much of an offender, being the opening track of the album. It is nicely atmospheric, but on subsequent listens the sole snare drum isn't enough to maintain the listener's interest. Next comes \\"Soul Meets Body\\", which you should know by now raises the expectations considerably, expectations which are not met by the completely average \\"Summer Skin\\". After that is \\"Different NamesFor The Same Thing\\", which has, to be blunt, some of the worst musical moments I've heard in some time. The outro seems to drag on forever, being completely boring, unremarkable, and irrelevant.    These problems plague the record incessantly. The album is too boring to be minimalistic and too refined to be lo-fi; in the end, it is just dull. The album continues interminally, and the only other ear-perking moment is the lyrically sweet but musically unremarkable \\"Someday You Will Be Loved\\".    \\"Plans\\" is a disappointment, but this is fairly irrelevant since the most adamant of Death Cab fans will buy it anyway. I suppose my advice would be to peruse the rest of their library first, and approach this record with low expectations.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|You won't like this movie if you like to view things as right vs wrong.<br /><br />Like a Greek Tragedy, this movie does not immerse itself in right vs wrong, instead the movie views the world as ironic twist of fate which are controlled by external forces greater than our own. This includes human sexuality in its most darkest form.<br /><br />This movie, contrary to popular belief, is not original. It is based on a Japanese comic book. The main female character \\"Mi-Do\\" is actually a Japanese, not Korean, name.<br /><br />The acting is superb. The ending will surprise you. Just as the story of Oedipus, perhaps the most famous Greek Tragedy, is known even by the illiterates, this movie will leave an indelible impression in your mind.
B000063UR1|5.0|I first saw this in the theater way back when.  Sci-fi has come a long way, but this movie is not without it's charms.  Back then it really did seem possible that we could destroy the planet with pollution.  And, there wasn't all that much sci-fi going on back in those days during the big gap between 2001 in the late Sixties and Star Wars in the mid-to-late Seventies.<br /><br />Now, the reason I'm giving it five stars isn't so much that this is a great movie.  It is good, but what really makes this DVD worth the relatively low price is all the extras and interviews.  It's a trip back in time the viewer can learn from regardless of his/her politics when it comes to environmentalism.<br /><br />Actually, the main character's willingness to kill his fellow crew members to save the trees and critters was way more disturbing to me now than it was back then.
B00005MP58|5.0|This A&E production is absolutely flawless, from the casting, to the locations, to the costuming, to the dances.  Each actor embodies the element of their character, from Colin Firth's superb portrayal of Mr. Darcy's aloofness, to Jennifer Ehle's spunky adaption of Elizabeth's wit and vivaciousness.  Although each and every actor is perfectly suited to their character, Alison Steadman as Mrs. Bennet is an absolute riot!  She steals nearly every scene she is in - - not an easy task when working with such a stellar group of performers.   <br />Having roughly five hours to tell the tale allows this production the advantage that it's 1940s counterpart did not - - the buildup of the romance between Darcy and Elizabeth, the foundation of the characters, their daily activities and the importance of the dance.   <br />Repeated viewings do not dull my enthusiasm for this wonderful miniseries. <br />Highly recommend this one!!   <br />
B00005JLKB|5.0|Every story has a beginning, and season 1 of Smallville is the lightest season compared to the complex stories and character development that comes in the later seasons.  Most episodes in season 1 center around high-school life and trials that most of us can relate to.  If you have an affinity for that time of your life, you may enjoy this fun season even more.  The acting is well done and you'll easily find yourself working through the episodes wondering what will happen next.  I found two episodes in season 1 to be among my all time favorites: Nicodemus and Leech.   I think that if you're thinking about skipping over season 1 that you would be making a mistake!
B00009ATIX|4.0|James Cameron and Steven Soderbergh's SOLARIS is a powerful yet subtle film. On equal footing, George Clooney's low-key performance is also powerful. Strange phenomena aboard a lonely space station are at the center of this film but it moves into deeper psychological regions that are very thought provoking.
0060899190|5.0|Who knew that finding out what others keep to themselves would be so moving?  This collection of the secrets of ordinary people is more than a voyeuristic romp through the living rooms, bedrooms, offices and souls of everyday people.  It is a revelation not only of the joys, hopes, desires, wit, pain and grief of the people who shared their secrets, but also of the reader, who will certainly find something of themselves within these pages.  I mean, who hasn't wanted to slip a bugger into a hateful spouse's soup?  Okay, well, I hadn't, at least not until I read about it here.  Once I stopped laughing.  Okay.  Stop looking at me like that.<br /><br />Who could fail to be moved by a child's postcard about his parents that says, \\"My mother killed my father... 10 years before he killed himself.\\"?<br /><br />The postcards are individual works of art, ingeniously illustrating that which cannot be described -- emotions -- that, collectively, make up a larger artwork.  Just when you think everything's been done already, you stumble across this gem of an idea and find there is, after all, still something new under the sun.  The secrets may be old but this is definitely novel.<br /><br />Post Secret should be required reading for psychologists, sociologists, marriage & family counselors, parents and anyone else who is a student of life and the human condition.
B000002BYD|5.0|Of all of the Pearl Jam CDs - this is by far my favorite. It's alittle obscure, alittle bizarre, etc... but that's who PJ is! Each song is really different. I enjoy listening to it every time. I seem to get alittle something different every time I listen. Great lyrics! Buy it - you won't be disappointed!
B00008PC2O|3.0|This DVD is anything but EXTREME. You don't get the original theatrical version, the extras are useless and you cant't watch the HD version in your TV (you must watch it on the copmputer). The 3 stars are for the great audio and video quality. Don't be fooled... this is NOT the ULTIMATE edition.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I am a 14 year old musician that was raised on blues. Muddy Waters, Robet Johnson, BB King, and the likes. I love the way Jack and Meg integrate elements of blues, rock, folk , and even some jazz (cold cold night) into their work, while still keeping it new. While guitarits like Stevie Ray Vaughn are surley great in their own rite, Jack keeps blues fresh, like its a new genre.  The strong points of this album would be Ball and Biscut, Black Math, I just dont know what to do with myself, and Girl, You have no faith in medicene.  There are a couple of weak songs, for example \\"the boy to warm your mothers heart\\", but nothing stands out as horrible.  This is a great album, and while it is not as blues-oriented as previous albums (De Stijl in particular)I still love it and am looking forward to further work from this band. <br /> <br /> <br />One more note, the reason i wrote this review was mainy to point out te ignorance of a previous commenter, who said that \\"The Air Near My Fingers\\" was a \\"retarded\\", \\"fake\\" rip off of Nirvana.  This is ridiculous, because any one could tell the difference between the two songs, and anyone with basic knowledge of chords would be able to tell the major difference, which is that the \\"Rape Me\\" chord structure is A-C-E-G, and \\"Air\\" is A-C-G-D. Nirvana being the only other semi-recent band i can listen to I could not let that false claim remain unchallenged.
B00003CX96|5.0|Among members of the Cycling Community, this movie is \\"IT\\".  Somehow overlooked is the fact that this flick was nominated for Best Picture, it's that good.  A Must Have for the Sports Section of your DVD collection.
B00005JLR8|5.0|This is a lovely film; happy and sad. \\"Do you believe in magic?\\" Magic becomes reality in this film as it equates to love, friendship, perserverance, and the optimism of young hearts. Sometimes magical miracles happen with the help of love from heaven and on earth.
0380799006|5.0|All the information in the book is indispensible in my opinion, assuming you want to raise healthy, loving children. <br /> <br />For me, the most telling information came out of quotes from adults expressing their own feelings about their siblings.  My kids are 2 and 4.  I have caught myself many times saying or doing something that those adults said irrevocably ruined their relationships with their siblings or their parents.  It made me really think about why my brother and I dislike each other (something I just accepted before) and realized my parent's attitudes and actions greatly affected our relationship and clearly caused most of the friction between us.  I'm sure they did what they felt was best, but now I know better. <br /> <br />I absolutely recommend this book to everyone with children.  Even if they've gotten to the teenage years, there's information there...use it!
B000BKVQTS|4.0|This movie was very fun, but you cannot take it too seriously. (Um...the director is Terry \\"Monty Python\\" Gilliam, so there's really no reason to EXPECT anything but fun and silliness.) Two brothers con their way to fame and fortune by pretending to be early 1800s ghostbusters (of the witches and demons variety) in French-occupied Germany. They run into trouble, though, when the French military catches them. In exchange for their lives, they must rid a small, German village of real haunts that have been stealing away children. <br /> <br />This movie has mediocre special effects and so-so acting, but everyone is having so much fun that it makes the entire film a real treat. Sure, \\"Army of Darkness\\" did this kind of cheesy-horror thing better, but this one is still enjoyable. Put your mind in neutral, pop a big bowl of popcorn, and enjoy the endless twistings of fairy tales and nursery rhymes.
B00003CXBK|5.0|First, let me warn parents that this movie is nothing like the usual Disney fare. There is violence that will be disturbing to younger children, and the story is complex on levels that will likely bore them. These are not negative things. This movie is simply made for adults. The movie itself develops a complex story in a strange fantasy world where technology and nature are locked in an endless struggle pitting nature-gods and demigods against mere humans equipped with weaponry. The main character in the film stands as a middle figure who has no ill will towards either side and seeks to bring the two into at least a truce. The images are stunning, and the sheer imagination necessary to create this magical world is breathtaking at times. The complexity of the problem is dealt with in a very balanced way, without demonizing one side or the other. This haunting movie stayed on my mind for a long time after I saw it, and caused me to think through issues of nature and technology, and where we fit into the world we live in and are responsible for. To anyone with a love for the visual and a desire to actually be challenged to think, this movie is a must see. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
0312995423|1.0|For a good review, see Alexander Paulsen's review here. I'm a Sr. Security Systems Engineer, so obviously I'm very technically biased when it comes to crypto and security, but I found myself continuously frustrated with the flaws in Dan's logic in this novel.<br /><br />When I reached the part of the book about Digital Fortress being encrypted by Digital Fortress itself, I threw the book at the wall in disgust. Paulsen's review states it best: \\"This is [a] monumental technical error and destroyed much of my enjoyment...\\". You don't have to be a security expert to realize that Dan doesn't really know what he is talking about. He's way over his head when he tries to discuss even the simplest crypto concepts. This completely ruins the book because the ability to suspend your disblief, crucial for most techno-thrillers, is completely compromised. After reading \\"Angels and Demons\\", which I enjoyed very much, I expected Dan Brown's reputation for painstaking research to shine in this book. It doesn't even flicker. Sorry Dan. Stick to historical and conspiracy theory material...
B00005JOHO|3.0|While this movie is inspiring, it can be a little boring at times, and unless you have a long attention span or really like golf, you may not be able to sit through the whole thing.  It has a little humor in it, but it's by far not the most fast-paced or humorous movie.  It has a couple of cuss words in it (I only recall about three of them.)  Even though it's a little slow, you should rent this movie, because you see how perserverance really works, and it's inspiring.  When you rent it, you can fastforward too, if it gets to where it's incredibly boring and you're about to fall asleep, but I advise you to at least view this movie once.
1401308201|3.0|Fans of Wicked will, of course, love this book. Fans of musicals in general will be disappointed. <br /> <br />The cover sets you up for a great fall with its brilliant design. It is padded, aged and just fun to hold & look at. The great design and layout continues inside, unfortunately the content just doesn't match up. <br /> <br />The book itself is full of interviews, glossy photos, lyrics and some script. Unfortunately most of it is about as deep as Galinda when she starts at Shiz University (translation for those of you who don't know the show: think of characters in the movie 'Clueless'). It is interesting that multiple casts are pictured and interviewed, but it means that none of the interviews are extensive or enlightening. There are many more behind the scenes photos available through a Google image search than this book that will give you insight into the development process by cast and crew. The cast recording is a better way to discover the lyrics. The script included here is incomplete. There are glaring holes throughout the parts presented. I was hoping to compare it to Gregory Maguire and L.Frank Baum's books to explore the developments through the different medium and learned little more than I already knew from the recording (I haven't scraped up the money or time to see the show on Broadway yet - I received this as a gift). <br /> <br />If you just want more about Wicked and something pretty for your shelf or table, go for this! <br /> <br />If you are a fan of musical theater and want a book that will give you insight into the process of developing a new, gorgeous, hit show then stick to the similar volumes that are available for RENT, Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera. They focused on delivering meaty content rather than just a glossy exterior. <br />For a connection to the show: if you like Galinda and your new-found popularity, buy this book. If you want to change the world along with Elphaba, your money is best spent on a show ticket.
B000000XB9|5.0|Takes me back to my childhood.  Every one of these songs still rocks me through and through.
B00005JLZN|3.0|I was confused by the ending.       We begin with Kate Winslet and her partner flying to Texas reponding to a request for a personal interview with the condemned David Gale.  As Gale tells his story, you automatically determine he's innocent; therefore, the movie becomes all about who framed him and for what reason? Can Kate Winslet get the evidence to the public in time before David Gale is executed?  Finding out whodunnit is almost too easy since Gale shows no urgency in trying to escape his fate.  Nonetheless, the movie throws in useless red herrings, ineffectively trying to be unpredictable and poorly meshing the suspense with the film's \\"Scooby Doo\\" mystery feel.  This messes up the movie rhythm entirely. Part mystery, part suspense, part human interest and part politcal...too many agendas in one film.    I guess I was expecting something profound and shocking like \\"Silence of the Lambs\\".  But it was not.        I'd skip it.
B00025ETIW|2.0|Aside from two songs ( \\"Helena\\" & \\"The Ghost of You\\" ), this album is pure crap. This album is mostly littered with songs about death ( what else would you expect from an album with two people covered in blood on the cover ), and tends to grow tedious after the first couple of songs. The songs never really develop any emotion, which it tries to mask with Gerard's whiny voice.My Chemical Romance doesn't have that \\"punk\\" feel, which leads me to believe that the band is nothing more than a bunch of nerds in heavy make-up, singing about death in a desperate and pathetic charade to sound emo.

B0009HLDFU|5.0|This is a fantastic cd beginning to end.  I speak of the first of the 2 cd's of course. The second is too slow and not 'foo' enough for me, but I appriciate the effort. Not one bad song on disc 1. I have not stopped listening to it for months.  Grohl is a gifted songwriter and all of the band members are awesome players.  If you ipod kids can't figure out how to get the cd on your ipod than you need some help.  Don't dis the Foos for that reason.
B0001LJCPC|4.0|Big fan of the movie! I feel this is a pretty complete collection of the songs. Everything I wanted is here. Including \\"Goodnight Moon\\", \\"Tu Mira\\", \\"About Her\\" (which is the main reason I bought it), \\"Malaguena\\", and \\"Irumi Bushim\\"
0553277472|5.0|It was fully thirty years ago that I read this book.  I picked it up from time to time, thereafter.  But my interests led me elsewhere.  Still, I remember this book vividly.  Even if now, its memory is fogged over in my mind.  My current reading list will outlive me. I will never read \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenace\\" again.  It is undoubtedly one of the few books that I have that has earned my lasting admiration.  It can be heavy lifting if you wish, but I do not remember it that way.  But, then I was young and full of vigor.

B000AA305M|3.0|I associate David Gray with great heart winning songs like \\"Flame Turns Blue\\" and \\"This Year's Love\\" These are two songs which come from great albums, Lost Songs and White Ladder, respectively. I was obviously quite excited about the new cd. I must say that I was a tad impressed upon the first listen but soon the sound got boring and rather happy-foolish. To my displeasure, I soon realised that all songs on Life In Slow Motion sound monotonous.<br /><br />\\"The One I Love\\" sounds a tad good on first few listens but soon sounds disoriented and lacklusture. I must say I like the album cover but David Gray has had better covers. What really went wrong with \\"Life In Slow Motion\\" is the loss of an identity. I could easily think it was Mick Hucknell or Bob Dylan singing and this has never happened with his music before.<br /><br />However, I'm still a David Gray fan and I await his next offering with a semi-ardent heart.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />PS - If you are looking for something worthwhile check out this artist Gilbert O Sullivan. He seems to have inspired more artists than I will ever bother to look up. His \\"very best..\\" is a great place to start and his song \\"Alone Again Naturally\\" is second to none.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|The second album in Sufjan Stevens quest to record an album for every State in the Union is perhaps as ambitious as the State has been itself. 23 tracks of Illinois history, stories, odes, and angel choruses, he did his homework and he's going to prove it to you. How? By recording it through a prism of strings, horns, winds, banjo, guitar, angelic harmonies, old-timey, odd-meters, plaintiveness, straight up good songwriting and playing many of the instruments himself. <br /> <br />The album starts off with \\"Concerning the UFO sighting near Highland, IL\\", with odd piano timing that wouldn't sound strange on a George Winston \\"December\\" tribute album. With flutes whirring around Stevens tells the story of an early-morning UFO sighting in 2000. He interprets things and colors them to make the stories his own. This song, like much of the album, uses religious metaphor. Comparing the UFO lights with \\"three stars\\", giving hope to the sighters.  <br /> <br /> <br />Songs like Track 3 \\"Come On! Feel The Illinoise! The World's Columbian Exposition\\" and later \\"The Tallest Man, The Broadest Shoulders\\" use complex interplay between the winds in 5/8 and 7/8 time signatures, while vocalists crisply syncopate the lyrics that capture the hope and excitement around the  <br />Chicago World's Fair of 1893. <br /> <br />The first single from the album \\"Chicago\\" is perhaps the best way to experience many things on this great album. Telling the story of his trip to New York (where Stevens actually lives) he states \\"I was in love with a place\\". The song features sweeping strings, trumpet lines, marimba, the chorus vocals everyone can sing along to, that delineate much of the album. Also here he captures the hope and excitement one can feel moving to a new city, a big city; leaving his past mistakes behind. <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Decatur\\" and \\"Jacksonville\\" use traditional Americana instruments, aptly setting the scene for Civil War Era stories. Although he uses the Civil War hero \\"Casimir Pulaski Day\\" for his own story, that perhaps happened on the Monday that only Chicago Public Schools honors as a holiday. <br /> <br />Perhaps one of the more beautiful songs on the album is also a disturbing one. \\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\" tells of the serial killer while showing empathy for him; a major feat for a songwriter. He relates this in the lines: <br /> <br />And in my best behavior <br />I am really just like him <br />Look beneath the floorboards <br />For the secrets I have hid <br /> <br />The album ends in a minimalist instrumental track worthy of composer Steve Reich. Are there ends to the bounds of Sufjan Stevens' talent? This album is winning indie album of the year awards left and right, and rightfully so. It's sheer ambition and attention to detail rewards repeated listening. I can't wait to see what he does with my home state, Wisconsin! <br /> <br />
038541627X|5.0|The worst part: Some of the stories in this volume are old, and you can tell that without looking at the published date. There are a significant number of them about the \\"future\\" where large companies have an entire computer of their own, or use jargon that is outdated. <br /> <br /> Saying that, they are unlikely to seem any older in another 50 years and only a few of the stories are harmed due to the oldness (and those that are can just be ignored -- there are a LOT of stories here). <br /> <br /> On the very positive side, there are a lot of stories that could have been written yesterday and are VERY GOOD (5 out of 5) ... and probably 90% are at least GOOD (4-5 out of 5).
B000E33VWW|5.0|\\"Capote\\" is an excellent, disturbing analysis of darkness touring, at first unwittingly, then compulsively and destructively, the most pitiful district of its large precinct, running its hand over the contours of a neighborhood polar opposite to the martini Saturday nights in uptown Manhattan and finding it equally rife with desolation and ruthlessness. The uplift of it? There is no uplift. It is a straight, fierce double shot of grain liquor. Some artists grope around in the abyss, are pulled in, and do not fully return. Franz Kafka. Sam Peckinpah. Vincent Van Gogh. John Kennedy Toole. Jackson Pollock. And Truman Capote, who wrote harmless society novels and larks for The New Yorker before he stumbled upon an item in the New York Times about a murdered family in a west Kansas farmhouse.  <br /> <br />He would go there for a magazine piece. Six years later he would produce \\"In Cold Blood,\\" still a titan of non-fiction and the treadmill for the true-crime section genre, Court TV, the Amber Alert, all of it. Director Bennett Miller and screenwriter Dan Futterman don't rehash the book - Richard Brooks' 1967 film does that fine. Instead, they follow Capote as he researches, writes, gloats, abuses his subjects - convicted murderers Perry Smith and Richard Hickok - drinks, smokes, and generally dissolves from the pressure of his talent and conflicted guilt over the impending deaths of the killers. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Capote, covers the journey as if he was born to it, effortlessly channeling the man's charm, malice and tunnel ambition, not to mention his speech and mannerisms. By movie's end you loathe and pity Capote precisely because he has the capacity for scruples, and he pitches them.   <br /> <br />In his New York fishbowl Capote holds court. In Holcomb, Kan., where Smith and Hickok murdered the Clutter family, he uses his novelist friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) as a frontwoman into the homes of reluctant witnesses and police investigator Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper). It works. In these scenes Capote is his usual storytelling self on a four or five, and he is very good at working over regular folks with stories of Bogart and Marilyn. He changes the day Smith and Hickok are captured and he meets Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) in the kitchen of the sheriff's apartment, in the women's holding cell. <br /> <br />\\"He's a goldmine,\\" Capote tells his friend Lee of Smith, a shy, tortured soul taken to Capote as a dog to a benevolent master. And because of it, Capote fights to save both killers from the death penalty until he can convince Smith to talk about the night of the murders. Until their hanging would better serve the ending of his book. By the hour of their execution in a warehouse behind Leavenworth prison, Capote has slipped into a basket of acute alcoholism, self-aggrandizement and persecution complex. Most authors stretch recollected truth; Capote's predicament is worse that he is an integral part of the truth. The fact of his book and the lives of those in it reverse priorities <br /> <br />The movie has an elegant, unhurried construction toward the moment Capote sees his subjects for the last time just before midnight. Miller inserts scenes of the winter Kansas prairie for emotional effect and structural progress - a shot of a distant passenger train sliding along the plains echoes Terrence Malick - while his interiors are cloaked in shadows and dimly-lit, stripped of their vibrancy; save a short interlude at Capote's home in Spain, the director works in blacks, grays, hunter greens, washed-out prison blues.  <br /> <br />Hoffman's dandy aside, the performances suit the tone. Keener's Harper Lee is steady, sage and close to saintly; she emerges as a bit of a cipher for Miller and Futterman's analysis of the lead character; in most scenes it's hard to tell whether she's Capote's friend or his philosophical foil Likewise Bruce Greenwood as author Jack Dunphy, Capote's lover. Cooper, as Alvin Dewey, maintains that talent of holding contempt and affection in the same moment while Collins plays Smith as a man who seems like a perfectly unfortunate soul before and after the hour he shot four people in the head.  <br /> <br /> <br />    <br />
B000C20VPA|4.0|This new \\"Special Edition\\" is a watered down version of last year's Anniversary Edition. Usually this is a bad thing. However, since Universal can't seem to figure out how to make a DVD-18 work properly, it's actually good they have seen fit to release this title as a single-sided, dual-layered DVD. Unfortunately, in doing so they have dropped most of the extras found on the Anniversary Edition. Still found on this release are the deleted scenes, the commentary and one of the featurettes.  <br /> <br />Why they didn't decide to do 2 DVD-9's for this is beyond comprehension, but at least they've dropped the list price a few dollars. <br /> <br />My rating is for the overall the release, although in my opinion both the film and the transfer on this release get 5 stars. Colors are vivid and rich, and detail is very fine. <br /> <br />In closing, if you're not a \\"special features\\" junkie, definitely get this release, as it's much more likely to play properly. If you must have the Anniversary Edition, make sure you play the disc right away, because most likely, it will have problems.
B000AQBA1W|5.0|After years of harsh criticism for not being traditional enough, The Corrs return to their roots with \\"Home\\", by the suggestion of drummer/vocalist Caroline Corr who insisted that it was \\"Time to do this record\\". But when The Corrs entered the recording studio in early 2005 just months after finishing the North American leg to their album supporting \\"Borrowed Heaven\\" (2004- Atlantic) tour, the rumor mill began to spin of a \\"traditional\\" record from the \\"once upon a time tradidional band\\". One year later with rumors fulfilled; The Corrs release their latest effort, \\"Home\\" their most commendable effort to date. <br /> <br />And just when you thought all the Corrs in the universe had a musical background enter Mum.  Home's 12 tracks consist of the  traditional and contemporary favorites from the pages of the late Jean Corr's personal songbook. With each song carefully handpicked, \\"Home\\" is the most personal and mature Corrs record to date. The band departs from the pop laden productions of past favorites such as 1997's \\"Talk On Corners\\" and 2000's \\"In Blue\\", and return with the classical production of Mitchell Froom with contribution of the BBC concert orchestra. <br /> <br />The featured tracks on \\"Home\\"  are indeed a departure and come to the ears of the public with a very acoustic guitar based sound. All is not lost though for classic Corr sound, as \\"Old Town\\" (Lynott) comes to us with a very mid 70's, up tempo, electric guitar appeal. Beside \\"old town\\", this album is a very spirited effort and even features two songs \\" Buachaill on Eirne\\" and \\"Brid Og Ni Mhaille\\" sung in the native tounge of Ireland; Gaelic. Even sister Sharon (violin/backing vocalist) recieves a shot at the mainstage mic with her smokey vocalled rendition of \\"Dimming of the Day\\" <br /> <br />With all things considered, this record is a sure to be classic in the well spirited and melodic catelogue of The Corrs. This band has been often donned by the merrits of their looks rather than their naturalability to perform and record great material. \\"Home\\" however is an undeniably honest and personal document into the history of the band and the place they call home, Ireland. Buy this album with confidence and enjoy the traditional and contemporary efforts of the best selling band to come out of Ireland since U2.
0060931671|1.0|This book comes across as severely dated and lame.  All the people who love this book are either nerds who think they're in on Pynchon's \\"joke\\" or they are nerds who havent read a good book like Catch-22. <br />
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I was skeptical when this movie came out, I had seen the great  A&E version and just could not imagine why anyone would try to top that..also I thought Keira Knightly was just too hot and contemporary to play Elizabeth Bennett, but much to my surprise I was blown away by this film, Knightly in particular; she was fantastic.  The actor that played Darcy got better as the film wore on, but let's face it there is only one Darcy, but I liked this take on Darcy, he has a kind face and that wears on you..in a good way.  I really liked Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett, his scene at the end with Knightly really got to me, it was perfect.  The period costumes where also well done and they well deserve their Oscar nomination.  The DVD extra's are wonderful, especially the background on Austen...so sad she never found her Darcy, but alas, that's probably what made her such a great romantic writer, dreams are often better than reality.
0440219078|4.0|Place yourself in a world where there is little or no emotion, an ordered community, ignorance of real life and where the word love is meaningless and you are in Jonas's world. This story makes you question whether or not you really want to live in that so-called perfect world. It also shows the horror of that perfect world. And when Jonas does begin to love he sets in motion events that can't be erased and are possibly devastating to the community. <br />The second time that you read the novel, The Giver, by Lois Lowry the story and characters are even more real than they previously were and the story has so much more depth than before. This novel is not only a good read for younger kids, but also for teenagers and adults because there are things in the novel that everyone can relate to. <br /> <br />~TA, Pembroke Academy <br />
B000E8N690|5.0|I LOVED this movie!!! It was powerful and so great! I truly Loved the performances by Resse Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix they were definetly Oscar worthy, in which I HOPE they both win for their pending nominations!!! I only wish the movie itself was nominated as well as the director of this wonderful film!!! I can relate to this movie too in a personal matter as well with my man having personal demons in his life. I am buying this film in few weeks too!!! I LOVED it!!!!!!! Definate MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!
0375757422|1.0|This book is extremely shallow, it has no depth or metaphorical intensity. It is basically a chick flick with big words which often make no sense. It should be classed as trashy light romance, not as classic literature. It is not a comment on society, merely a glimpse of the life of one extremely conceited and shallow woman, Emma Gayhouse. DO NOT BUY
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Where do I begin?  The moment when Jude Law (as Sky Captain) bursts out in marvelous laughter, after Gwyneth Paltrow's stumbling camera-snapping mishap across a log bridge, is worth the price of this DVD and then some. <br /> <br />With nearly the entire production photographed in blue screen, with backgrounds, effects, and even characters mixed in later, the actors in this film show their brilliance, from Jude Law to Gwyneth Paltrow to Angelina Jolie to Giovanni Ribisi to the late Lord Olivier. <br /> <br />The extras on this disk that show the process in making this independently produced film are equally fascinating.

I love this version with GC Scott but there are scenes missing, the audio skips and cuts out and the video looks like it's being taken off of a worn out 8MM. Lines down the sides at times, jumping around and just plain horrible picture. The supplier should be ashamed.
6304298285|5.0|an excellent film. great humour and a great plot. Casted well with very imaginative scenes. Its a great film. Don't miss out!!!!
B0009S3HI0|4.0|This is a compliation of SOME of the covers and Songs that never made it to whole albums. Nothing Wrong with that, except it is missing most of the songs I wanted. <br /> <br />No Teeting. <br />No Can't Hardley Breath. <br />No To Have and Hold. <br />and NO Weezer Covers. <br /> <br />The last was truley Shocking, since every time I've seen Deftones Live, they have done a Weezer Cover (mostly Say It ain't so). <br /> <br />The songs are all pretty okay. The Skynard Cover Blows that crappy Shinedown Cover out of the water and The Sade cover is stangely Awesome. The other covers are pretty cool too. <br /> <br />The DVD is Solid. Worth The Price without any of the Music. <br /> <br />If they had Sold this as a DVD of all the videos with a \\"BONUS CD of B-Sides and Covers!\\" I think the Reviews would have been better. <br /> <br />At least they Didn't sell them seperatly. <br /> <br />Now we just wait for the next Album to get our socks rocked off again. <br /> <br />In the meantime, I'm gonna listen to Team Sleep.

B00009W0U4|3.0|Amazon has a major marketing gaffe if they are trying to sell this move along with the French drama The Dreamers.  A fan of The Dreamers, I checked this one out, and anyone coming from the erotic drama/political commentary of The Dreamers is going to have their pants shocked off by Irreversible.  Both movies are French and show skin, but that's where the similarities stop, and they diverge pretty far from one another, in fact.  I'm boggled that anyone would lump them together.<br /><br />At any rate, Amazon's marketing got this unsuspecting viewer to check out Irreversible.  It is very tough to watch, not only for the extreme violence, including sexual violence, but the opening scenes use non-stable, moving camera angles that can inspire seasickness directly from your couch!  There is also a grating soundtrack that could drive one to insanity all on its own, regardless of the images it is accompanying.  I admire the director, however, because when I was watching the disturbing opening scenes, I was not just disturbed by the content itself, but by the visual experience (camera angles) and the sounds all around me.<br /><br />One reviewer mentioned watching this movie over 10 times, in search of any plant life in the urban setting.  I'm amazed that anyone could handle this movie more than once.  I'm going to give it 3 stars, but this is one of those movies that you either love or hate, depending on your tastes.  It is well-done, the reverse-order storyline plays out well, but it is definitely not for everyone.<br /><br />Fans should check out the French film \\"Baise Moi\\" and the overlooked American \\"Love and a .45.\\"
B0000214F0|3.0|Caligula makes me glad I am living in the 21st century where my biggest concern is whether my phones are tapped, or how do I buy a 1500 sq foot condo for $1,000,000. Like today, RHIP (rank has its privileges). If you're an emperor, you can screw anyone you want. It hasn't changed much in 2000 years. Sexually it's a turnoff. Brass is a great director. Its a freak show, with giant priapii, one-eyed jacks, and beautiful Penthouse models.<br /><br />I would have preferred a spiritual balance.
6304708491|5.0|I first saw Help! when I was in middle school, rifling through my parents' VHS collection.  My friends and I were won over by this silly comedy and the Fab Four, and I have treasured the movie ever since.  It is unfortunate that the US DVD release is out of print (I had to buy an imported version), and I hope they bring it back soon, so more people can share in the pure joy of this brilliant comedy.<br /><br />The plot is pure genius in its simplicity:  a gaudy red ring gets stuck on Ringo's finger.  A sacrificial cult chases him around the world, trying to paint him red in preparation for his sacrifice.  A mad scientist is determined that he could--dare I say it?--rule the world, if he could only get the ring off Ringo's finger.  The Beatles are absolutely clueless.  So they run around the world, dodging crazy people at every turn, singing songs, and generally being hilarious.<br /><br />The DVD I bought had options to watch the movie dubbed in French.  So once you've seen Help! enough times to know every line by heart, try it out in a foreign language, and laugh even harder at The Beatles speaking in French.<br /><br />Go... to... THE WINDOW... GO... TO... the window...

B000066C6Z|5.0|Top Secret! Combines all the best of comedy:  parody (mostly of spy films and the Elvis genre), slapstick, sight gags, puns and plays on words, and just general laughs of both a juvenile and high-brow nature.  Some of the funniest moments take place in the background, behind the main scene.  This is a film you can watch twice in a row and pick up different laughs each time.  I also just discovered that there are even laughs to be found in the closing credits, and I've been watching this movie for 2 decades now!  Top Secret! is one of those magical movies that appeals to viewers of all ages, even those who didn't live in the time of the Berlin Wall, and there are jokes to appeal to all senses of humor.<br /><br />There is no obvious way to tell this is a 1980's movie--it stays perfectly in the time period the directors were trying to portray.  This is a gem and I'm glad it wasn't tainted by any attempts at a sequel.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|While browsing through underground music I came across this band. Panic! at the disco. I gave them a chance. Listening to the vocals I thought they sounded like fall out boy, with catchier beats that just make you want to dance. I went out and bought the album, and of course fell in love with it. There is not a single bad thing I can say about this band. There wasn't a song I didn't like, or wasn't stuck in my head for the next week. Buy this album! You wont be disappointed with their great beats and amazing vocals.
B000AARKW6|5.0|The plot synopsis for this movie describes how gangster Carlito Brigante is released from jail and vows to go straight, \\"but old associates and old instincts suck him back into a world of violence and mistrust.\\"  Sounds pretty standard, right?  Imagine my surprise at finding out that Carlito's Way is a much more complex story, not just about entanglements with the old associates, but about his entire sense of honor and justice, and it is a \\"good guy\\" who ends up leading to Carlito's fall from the straight-and-narrow.  Even when betrayed by his friends and associates, Carlito maintains his sense of honor and ethics.  The audience can't help but identify with Carlito's struggle to go straight, to commit a minimum of bad deeds in pursuit of his dream of escaping the city.<br /><br />As Carlito, Al Pacino is in top form, playing the character in a straightforward, low-key manner.  Sean Penn puts in a terrific performance as the frizzy-haired, coke-addled lawyer who gets in over his head playing in the turf of the Mafia.
B000BT97AO|5.0|Not since The City of Lost Children has such a wonderful surreal masterpiece been produced.  The movie follows Helena a 13 year old girl whos family owns a circus.  Helena and her mother have a disagreement and gets sick.  Later in the movie Helena falls into a dream world of mystery and illusions.   <br />     Like The City of Lost Children the movie follows its own visuals and its own logic.  Also like the other movie it feels like a whole new world with it's own new world.  You can't fight or try to figure out the movie you just have to watch it.
B00005NTN5|5.0|Bound has it all--crime double-crosses, love double-crosses, a steamy lesbian love affair, and Mob entanglements.  There's not much to say about the plot that hasn't been said by others, and the real joy is watching the schemes and twists unfold on the screen.  In addition to a terrific plot, this film is visually stunning, and Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon are in top form.<br /><br />One of my favorite lines comes from Gina Gershon's character, Corky, when Violet proposes that they rob her Mob boyfriend.  Corcky and Violet have already slept together, and Corky's response is that she can *do* anybody in bed, but she has to really know them if she is going to pull a score with them.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of thrillers and crime dramas that go above and beyond the norm!
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica's 4th album is one of their greatest.  The guitar's are slightly crisper and cleaner than on MOP or RTL, and the songs are slightly more complex along with the lyrics.  Overall, it's just an amazing album.  What I do dislike though, is not about the band, it's about the reviewers reviewing the band.  The so-called \\"suicide\\" music that they hear is just what life is.  Instead of always singing, like other bands, about their girlfriend leaving them, getting a new girlfriend, or something happening with their girlfriend, they display what the rest of the world is like, of which our sheltered lives will never see.  I commend Metallica on creating an amazing album, and recommend you to purchase it.
0375507256|5.0|David Mitchell does what no one has done since Pynchon: he's made postmodern experimentation fun again, and not the least bit self-indulgent.  In CLOUD ATLAS he plays with various genres:  the novel as diary, the epistolary novel, the detective novel, the British farce, science fiction and the speculative novel, turning each genre on its head, while making the material easily accessible.  Somehow it all comes together at the end to make a statement on the nature of mankind and his wasteful ways.  Mitchell should be regarded in the first tier of world novelists.
0140288503|5.0|I avoided this book for a good long while. While I read military history, for a long time I thought I didn't like modern stuff (post Korean War) much at all. I've recently discovered that what I disliked, at least in part, was the Cold War. Now that that's over, I can read about other modern conflicts, and they seem interesting to me. There are lessons to be learned, insights to be gotten, things to be observed. <br /> <br />Black Hawk Down recounts the famously bloody battle in Mogadishu where 18 US Army Rangers, Delta Force \\"operators\\" and aviators were killed by an angry mob of Somali \\"fighters\\" who were upset because their clan hadn't been chosen by the US and the UN to run the country. The army decided to launch a lightning strike to capture a couple of key men in that faction, and the resulting firefight was one of the most prolonged and violent in recent American history. Out of a force of 150 personel, 18 were killed and about 70 wounded. Those are casualties of close to 60%, which are very heavy under any circumstances. Approximately 500, perhaps more, Somalis were killed, both \\"fighters\\" and locals caught in the crossfire. <br /> <br />The operation was ultimately a failure, in that the Pentagon, Congress, and the White House all lost faith in the mission and shut down the American military involvement in the country. The one American taken prisoner was released without conditions a week and a half after the fight, and all American forces were withdrawn within a month. <br /> <br />The book recounts the operation with a you-are-there intensity and immediacy which is remarkable. It also has the authentic feel of something that really happened, recounted as it actually occurred. Usually with a book like this (especially one written by a reporter) there are telling little details that are inaccurate. Here, if such occorred I didn't see it. Instead, the author tells the men's story as carefully and respectfully as he can, and the result is frankly riveting. <br /> <br />This is a depressing story, and I don't think it's appropriate to speak of enjoying the book. It's very well-written, however, and the author does a good job of conveying the course and results of the battle to the reader. Highly recommended.
B00001U0E1|4.0|I am a Shakespeare buff, so I didn't find this movie all that accure. But, it is very interesting and shows how his plays connected with his life. The story-line is a little dull and VERY \\"Hollywood,\\" but if you're one for period costumes, these are great! It shows such a range in the clothing of the era, from poor to rich, male and female. It's great just for that, and for havign some very attractive actors in it.

B00005JJX8|5.0|Cary Grant plays a retired jewel thief on the French Riviera. Grace Kelly plays a very attractive and wealthy American socialite (talk about a stretch). A series of robberies occur and Grant's John Robie character is suspected and he must go into action to clear his name. <br />At the time thought to be a light Hitchcock film, it is now recognized as one of the all time classics. Hitchcock knew how to present Kelly in her best light in this and the other 2 films he did with her. The scenery- both Kelly and the French Riviera- is great and Grant has a role that is custom fit for him. John Williams is also excellent as the insurance agent who brings them together. It's hard to believe that this is film is now more than 50 years old.

B00005MAM2|4.0|Does a movie become a masterpiece because it's a great example of genius filmmaking? Or is it simply that it became massively popular and enough people mentioned it that it became a masterpiece by default. Akira, and probably Ghost in the Shell, are usually anime starters for people. Both are visually great, have good characters, and requires a bit of reality leaping since they're about things which are quite in the \\"fantastic\\" as I say. <br /> <br />Tetsuo and Kaneda are childhood friends who are in a bike gang in Neo Tokyo. While in a bike race/battle with a rival gang(very cool scene btw), Tetsuo gets injured by a discolored young boy with some odd gifts. Tetsuo is then taken to a facility where they experiment on him to awaken psychic abilities. The experiments worked, only one problem: Tetsuo didn't exactly have a good childhood because of being treated like a kid so he decides to attack all those opposed to him and try and find the odd thing known as Akira. <br /> <br />Like I said, this is in the \\"fantastic\\" realm: we're in 2019, World War 3's happened and we have technology we don't have, not to mention the gifts and things that go into that \\"must be believed to be seen\\" category. So when you see a kid who can deflect bullets, fly out into space and destroy a bridge, you know you're not dealing with simple physics. So if you're starting to like anime, watch Akira because shows get even stranger than that so if you can watch it and not find it ridiculous, then you'll be okay.  <br /> <br />For a near 20 year old film, the animation's quite fluid although one thing bugged me: the character designs. A couple characters literally looked like twins and this isn't a case of the \\"x colored color big eyed babe\\" syndrome from other shows, they literally look alike. The animation is good though, such as the bike chase, Tetsuo using his powers and probably the strangest freak out scene since Dumbo's pink elephants or Trainspotting's detox. <br /> <br />Akira is one ofthose kind of films that you really have to pay attention or see it more than once. There's literally people who see it 4 times and are still clueless about certain things, which is where an important debate pops up: is this genius by screenwriters to make us think and discuss the story, or is it simply laziness or sloppyness that they slap whatever and make it come across as being \\"arty\\". The Evangelion series/movie was accused of this but with Akira it's not quite as abstract but there's parts where you will go \\"huh?\\" <br /> <br />It is a good film with good pacing and some remarkable animation but whether to call it the best anime film ever is highly debatable. The biggest anime? Most likely it is.
B00000K3CM|5.0|This movie is funny and heart warming.  It is a great Christmas movie for the family to watch together and to realize the main point of the movie: Without your family, nothing is the same.  We need to love eachother and cherish the time that we have together.
B0009P42S2|3.0|It's a common law that only gets broken rarely: the more anticipated something is, the less likely chance it'll meet or exceed expectations. A new cd by a band you love might not be that great. The follow-up to a director's past masterpiece falls below expectations. Steamboy is one of those kind of films where there's an obvious enthusiasm and passion involved, it's just not what it should've been. <br /> <br />We're in the mid 1800's right smack in the middle of the Industrial Revolution in Europe. Steam is the big thing so when Ray Steam(very lazy name) gets his hands on an odd \\"Steam ball\\", he soon becomes a target for the O'Hara Foundation. They want to harness the power of the ball for their own needs(which obviously don't benefit anyone) so Ray has to keep the ball away from people who would want to use it.  <br /> <br />One thing that made Akira enjoyable was that the story just seemed to unfold without any hiccups(even if you couldn't understand it). Steamboy's pacing is incredibly off since it feels so SLLOOOWWW. So much happened yet I was only 40 minutes in. It doesn't help that there's not much to the story either. The moral of the story it seems is that technology for personal use is bad while technology benefiting everyone is good. Granted you could say it's something else but the film is so black and white that you'd have to say it like that. Many technology we use we actually use on our own or for our own needs. <br /> <br />The characters aren't really that interesting either and don't go through much change. Ray is your typical hero that saves the day when he doesn't exactly possess the skills to do so, it's more through luck. There's Scarlett, your very typical spoiled brat who wants things her way and for us to answer everything or criticize when we don't know it. Usually in films they learn their lesson but here, she's still bossy and spoiled. The only one that really goes through any amount of change is our \\"villain\\" but he has a big change of heart incredibly quickly you're like \\"gee that was fast\\". <br /> <br />Now all those negatives and some positives? Of course and it's the animation. Using 3D, the animation looks very stylized and fluid without being a bit obvious. A lot of 2D/3D mixtures tend to be very noticeable to distinguish the 2 but here it's almost flawless. I say almost because certain characters in early scenes almost looked pasted onto the background. <br /> <br />Now I didn't watch the english dub but it's probably good since it has reliable Patrick Stewart and Alfred Molina and Anna Paquin...playing a boy. Yes, Rogue from X-Men is playing a teenage boy. She even mentions in the special features that the ADR people had to tell her to say things more lower register. Why they didn't just get a young guy actor or an older one with good range to do it is beyond me. <br /> <br />Is it a great film? No. Terrible film? No. In the middle? Most definately. If you're an anime fan, you should check it out but since this is a highly anticipated project from the man who brought you Akira, you'll probably find it won't live up to your expectations.
0140439056|4.0|CHARLES DICKENS A CHRISTMAS CAROL AND OTHER CHRISTMAS WRITINGS is a wonderful collection of Christmas renderings previously published in various Charles Dickens collections.  Always the holiday favorite during the Christmas season, old Ebenezer Scrooge and his cast of spirits set the stage for A CHRISTMAS CAROL, which is the highlight of the book.  However, the other stories included in this volume are a delight to read and show blueprints to the CAROL as well as after thoughts, such as 'The Story of the Goblins who Stole a Sexton' and THE HAUNTED MAN AND THE GHOST'S BARGAIN.<br /><br />Beyond the holly and the ivy, Charles Dickens' writings show readers his references to societal issues in nineteenth century England that revolve around Christmas.  Dickens explores issues, which relate to class and memory in order to achieve deeper meaning and human qualities for the characters he creates.  In an era where industry and consumption began to overtake the true meaning of Christmas, Dickens uses his craft to show readers to compassion still exists during hard times.  The latter stories in the book exemplify his intentions, \\"A Christmas Tree\\", \\"What Christmas Is, As We Grow Older\\", and \\"The Seven Poor Travellers.\\"<br /><br />Dickens charming stories have a timeless quality that have been revered through time regardless of what century or season they have been read.  For those already familiar with the Carol, the other stories will offer more insight to Dickens' writings.  Overall, this is a great collection that may be read like campfire stories on a cold winter's night, or simply cozily by the fireplace.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Others have justly reviewed this movie positively, and I'm not going to say more except to weigh in with a five star vote to help keep the movie's rating high.  It's one of the best movies there is.  You'll have to be a grown up to appreciate this film.  It is not fast paced.  The music is a tremendous complement to the film, the cinematography is just right, it's just a jewel.  It's a pity it isn't better known.
B00005JO1Y|2.0|The things I liked about \\"King Kong\\" were the dazzling special effects and the personification of Kong.  Peter Jackson should've just focused on the love relationship between a beauty and a beast (aka Ann Darrow and King Kong) and the commerce and greed of the film director (aka Carl Denham), and forget about everything else.    Overall, I found \\"King Kong\\" to be an overblown, repetitive and unfocused film.  This is what happens when you give an Oscar-winning director carte blanche to do whatever he wants to do.  He tags on an additional 90 minutes to the original with nothing of importance to say.    The first hour is extremely boring.  Who cares about knowing every Tom, Dick and Harry on the ship?  As far as I'm concerned, the three main characters were Kong, Ann Darrow and Carl Denham.  Since Kong was not on the ship, Jackson should've just developed the Darrow and Denham characters.  I really didn't care about the Captain, the Jamie Bell character nor the conceited actor.  (You see, I don't even remember the names of these characters because that's how insignificant I felt they were.)  A lot of these characters could've been edited out.    I liked the budding relationship between Ann Darrow and Kong during the second hour.  However, I found most of the fight scenes to be nonsensical and repetitive (except for the ones that involved Kong).  A lot of these fight scenes could've been edited out.    I actually didn't have any problems with the final and third hour because it concentrated on Carl Denham, Kong and Ann Darrow.  \\"King Kong\\" could've been a much more stronger and powerful movie if the film editors had done their jobs.  But because I enjoyed the special effects and the personification of Kong, I decided to give it 2 stars.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|It is really an amazing stuff, everyone should have a copy of this MegaEvent, this kind of Concerts not happen every year, so buying a Copy Make us think that we collaborate in a way somehow, Buy also de LIVE AID concert from 1985.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|All three episodes in this collection are Marverick series classics.  Two of the three star both Bret and Bart and all three are among my personal favorites.  They are humorous and very clever and hold ones interest throughout.
B000001EGA|5.0|This (LP) was a special moment in my life. Still today I love to hear those pure art music... good rock, good musicians, Elton at a \\"Fantastic\\" performance.<br /><br />Don't loose it ! One of the best pop-rock album ...
B0006J28KU|5.0|Definitely good if you're a Pacino fan. The special features add<br /><br />a lot to what is already a good movie. The only thing to realize<br /><br />is that if you haven't seen this movie it's important to be<br /><br />patient. The movie moves slow if all you want is a bunch of explosions and fight scenes. These things are in the movie but you have to wait for them. The movie starts off exciting but soon becomes a story that is being built for the confrontation<br /><br />at the end between the two main characters. If you don't pay attention to the performances of not only the main actors<br /><br />but the less featured actors then you won't hear or see all<br /><br />the details that build the story for the ending. It's worth<br /><br />watching if you can watch a 3 or 4 hour movie. I liked it because of the cast, espically Pacino and Deniro. If you don't like Pacino or Deniro or can't wait 3 or 4 hours for most movies<br /><br />that long then I reccomend you rent it before you buy it.
0064409422|5.0|This is a book that introduces children to wonders of other worlds, and reveals to adults the wonders of their world.  Full of hidden meaning that is revealed as you grow up with the book.  The stories are heart-warming and should be read by everyone.
B000E8N690|5.0|There is simply no other word to describe this movie, but amazing. Everything in this movie has been so well thought out and the singing is AMAZING! This is a very inspirational movie and no doubt, one of my all time favorites!
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I fell in love with the music when I saw the movie.  The film moved WAY too slowly to suit me but the music makes me want to hear more.  LOVE the vintage country sound.
B0006A9FMI|3.0|The film is quite good, just not as good as the original. I liked the deeper psychology and less violence than the first GitS film. There were some parts where I found myself thinking that they were stretching in order to fill time but most of it did not drag. The artwork is an odd mixture of 2D animation and CGI 3D for some scenes. It felt a little funny but overall it worked. The subtitles and lack of an English track is a huge omission but I had no trouble following what was going on. I got mine used at a deep discount so maybe I'm a little forgiving. I'll probably  pick it up again when the English dubbed version gets here. That would raise it up to a 4-star.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|My daughter and I enjoy watching Gilmore Girls together, having it on DVD allows us to do that.  This third season has been our favorite selection.
B000001ZS3|5.0|This 1976 recording is one of the best electronic recordings of all time.  Very original and not describable by words, even Jarre has not surpassed this release in the last 30 years.  He's still trying!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I saw this movie four times in the theatre, mostly because I absolutely adored how Matthew Macfadyen portrayed Darcy. Watch it and you'll understand why all the girls in the audience go \\"awwww\\" everytime he appears. I haven't watched the BBC version, but I feel sorry for people who hold the older version on such a high pedestal and never let themselves enjoy anything else. It's called openmindedness, people!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you've see the film Serenity you'll love the firefly series. <br />  I somehow missed it when it was on TV and truly regret I couldn't have been one of many fans who must have screamed bloody murder when it was cancelled. <br />  It is such a pleasure to watch.  So well-written and the cast is perfect.  The whole idea of space being handled much like the new west was is so unique and the dialogue has such humor and is just how real people talk and relate to <br />each other. <br />  All the episodes are great but I especially loved the captain's run in with mrs. reynolds, including the rematch. <br />  I have trouble rewatching them since my whole family loves <br />them and is always borrowing them.   <br />  As I said at the beginning, if you loved the movie you're gonna <br />love the series!
B000002UAU|2.0|I bought this remembering what I thought about the Beetles and boy was it a disappointment.  My gosh they weren't very good were they; rather amateurish and just not very good musically. <br />The songs were good and I did enjoy revisiting the album which I hadn't heard in over 20 years.  But the one thought I came away with was that they weren't really very good and one wonders how they came to be what they became.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I just love this series and really didn't get into it when it was on.  I like so many others want to know what is the holdup with releasing the 2nd and 3rd series. <br />It is such a wholesome story with many meaningful things to think about in family life and other relationships. You not only can enjoy it but learn from it. I love it and am sad that I'm on my last dvd of the set and can't get more. PLEASE HELP!!
B000E6ENP8|5.0|Joaquin (Leaf) Phoenix (Ladder 49, Clay Pigeons) blazes and exlpodes emotionally and terrifically as the man in black, Johnny Cash, just as Jamie Foxx did last year when he played legendary Ray Charles. Phoenix had to learn how to play the guitar and know 26 Cash songs, along with Reese Witherspoon (Just Like Heaven, Vanity Fair) in her best performance so far in her career as the woman Cash fell deeply in love with, June Carter. Witherspoon gives a flawlessly performance...its really fabulous. It begins with Cash and his band at the Folsom Prison but then goes into flashbacks when Cash was a little boy and a tradgic death shook his family. Cash never got along with his father, played by Robert Patrick (Tv's The X-Files, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and they had a shaky relationship. Then, they show how Mr. Cash married his first wife, played by Ginnifer Goodwin and Cash had 2 kids and how he started his band and his music career making his first record, to breaking in at 14 on the top charts and growing more and more famous. He also had a pill and booze addiction, sometimes too much and he'd get angry, wreck things or look really sick....they show how he collapsed one time performing on stage. It also shows how he grew more and more in love with June Carter but she wouldnt take him, but she couldnt help but come back into his life and eventually she accepted to marry him during one of their performances. One of the best movies of the year without a doubt and Phoenix is a masterwork here almost coming close to sounding like the man himself. A truly great achievement and two great unforgettable performances. \\"Hello....I'm Johnny Cash!!!!\\" <br />
B00005KAQP|5.0|Talk about a turnabout situation. Any of you who have seen The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie will remember Maggie Smith playing a rather unorthodox teacher in Scotland who angered her superiors by her inordinate method of influencing her young pupils and rebelling against authority. Now, as Mother Superior, her straight-laced character has to deal with a lounge singer disguised as a nun who has the same characteristics Miss Brodie had! I loved Sister Act and Sister Act 2 very much; both left me in good spirits with rollicking music, mad chase scenes, a transformed choir and a head nun with new ideas on how to run a convent.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Rent will forever be a legend of musical theatre. Jonathan Larson's intimate and incredibly personal musical went on to win rave reviews, phenominal success, several Tony Awards, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Larson never got to see the success of his baby, however, as he died of an undiagnosed aeortic aneurism the night of the final dress rehearsal. Would Rent have earned the success it did had the tragedy of Larson's death not thrust the musical into the headlines? Would Larson have approved of the move from a small Off-Broadway theatre to a full-blown Broadway production? What would Larson have done had he been granted a lengthy career? We can never know, but he has left a legacy that even the most wide-eyed dreamer couldn't imagine. <br /> <br />This film has been sputtering around Hollywood for nearly a decade, with directors from Spike Lee to Joel Schumacher attached to direct at various times. Thankfully, Mirimax couldn't agree on how to approach the project, which catapulted no less than four directors from behind the camera, leaving room for the vastly underappreciated Chris Columbus to make his first truly great film. His vision for Rent was one that embraces the show's theatrical roots as opposed to masking them, as in 2002's Chicago. He utilizes no tricks to bring the musical numbers inside the characters' heads, and yet his film manages to be the best movie musical in decades, and yes, that is including the aforementioned razzle dazzle Catherine Zeta-Jones vehicle. <br /> <br />The story itself is rather insignificant. It follows the basic outline of Puccini's classic opera, La Boheme, updated to include drug abuse, AIDS, homosexuality, drag queens, and most importantly rock music. We follow the lives of a group of eight bohemians living in New York City as they celebrate love and life over the course of a year. They encounter new friends, old enemies, and yes, even death, and yet the film never preaches is message of \\"No day but today.\\" <br /> <br/>One of this film's greatest strengths is its cast. With six of the original eight principle actors from the Broadway production, there is a sense of family that is integral to the believability of the drug- and disease-filled story. Of those six, Anthony Rapp as film-maker Mark and Jesse L. Martin as teacher Collins fare the best. Rapp instills Mark with an over-the-top energy that embues his character with a genuinely likable quality, while Martin is so charmingly joyful one can't help but adore the character. <br /> <br />Both newbies give extraordinarily strong performances, particularly Rosario Dawson as the drug-addicted, AIDS-inflicted stripper Mimi. For a character that is often played frustratingly large, Dawson brings to Mimi a sweet vulnerability that serves both story and character. It is unfortunate that the actor who shares the most scenes with Dawson, Adam Pascal, appears so uncomfortable with the medium that Roger, \\"the bittersweet, evocative\\" songwriter, is both wooden and unrelatable. It's a shame, really, as the Mimi/Roger relationship is at the center of the story. Tracie Thoms, the other newcomer, is easily the best singer in the cast. <br /> <br />The true heart of the film, however, lies in the character of Angel, a lovable drag queen who is also inflicted with AIDS. As played by Wilson Jermaine Heredia, the character is immediately likably familiar. While Heredia plays the character just a tad too flamboyant and stereotypical, that is what Larson wrote for the character. Angel is the reason this story works. He is at once recognizable as a real person, and while he is not actually based on any one person, audiences can see a bit of him in everyone. <br /> <br />The cinematography is absolutely stunning. It compliments both the somber and lively musical numbers without making the film feel glossy. \\"Tango: Maureen\\" in particular is a fantastic scene, ironically enough being the only scene to take place in a fantasy. The dance itself is electric and powerful, and a perfect introduction to the flighty character Maureen, played by Tony-winner Idina Menzel. Also rousing is \\"La Vie Boheme,\\" the most celebratory song in the film. There is more energy present in this one scene than appeared in the entire runtime of last year's Phantom of the Opera.  <br /> <br />As for the Extras, the DVD is both sparse and rewarding all at once. The commentary with Columbus, Rapp, and Pascal, the sole feature on the first disk, offers little insight into the making of the film, but is interesting enough to warrent a listen. Weirdly enough, though, the language on the commentary is censored with bleeps, something I have never seen before. Disk two is fairly sparse as well, but it contains a 2 hour-long documentary that follows Rent from Jonathan Larson's childhhod straight through to the film. This is one of the best making-of documentaries ever offered as a DVD extra, and it was clearly made with love and respect for the man that brought Rent into being. I found myself weeping when Larson's death was finally mentioned, over an hour into the doc. One would have to have a heart made out of stone not to be moved by Larson's story. Also noteworthy on the second disk are several deleted scenes and musical numbers. The dialgue sequences were clearly deleted for a reason, as they neither advance nor improve the story, but the two songs, \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Goodbye, Love\\" add much depth and emotion to the final act of the film. These songs are a wonderful addition to the DVD, but Columbus was right in cutting them, much to the disappointment of \\"RentHeads\\" everywhere. <br />
0792164903|5.0|This is one great movie.The setting is real great all cloudy and dark makes it really great.The acting is real great he plays the real jumpy Ichabod crane,Chirstina ricci plays the beautiful Katrina van tassel.A very great movie
B00005JNRE|5.0|I have just returned from watching this absolutely incredible movie and have read these reviews.  You missed a story in that this movies is also part Cinderella. Did you not forget about poor Miss Evangeline? <br /> <br />My hat is also off to Ms. Thompson in that she was able, the course of a few short minutes to teach lessons to my children that are far overlooked in this day and age.   <br /> <br />Take a lesson, we all need a bit of Nanny McPhee in our lives these days.
B000AP04FG|2.0|This movie actually kept me interested up until the two main characters blew each others cover, after that it got sillier and sillier by the second. Classic Hollywood nonsense, obviously aimed to the eyecandy oriented viewers. There is no message here, there is nothing based on real life, there is only silliness after silliness. Overall: BORING and BADDDDDD!
B000BYA5GO|5.0|After reading one too many negative comments regarding the film Lord of War here at Amazon, I felt compelled to write and defend it.  Yes, it's probably not a movie most teenagers would want to sit through, but it's not targeted toward that market.  My wife and I watched Lord of War last night and thought it was engaging, riveting, well acted, entertaining and far from boring.  I believe it is one of Nic Cage's better movies, and this is from a guy who doesn't like all Nic Cage films.  I won't rehash the plot; simply scroll to the next review if you're curious.  To those of you considering a rental or even a purchase, I say go for it, you will not be disappointed.  I did purchase this movie, haven't regretted it for one second and am proud to have added it to my growing DVD library.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|This is one of the most compelling soundtracks to come out in a number of years. It is beautiful from start to finish....
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I mean it.  After a show so well thought out, and marvelously executed, it's difficult to subject myself to sitcoms again.  The characters developed such a rich full flavor so quickly, Joss Whedon you've done it again.  kudos!
B00004W4UB|1.0|This movie had an interesting idea going for it in the beginning, but the bad acting, bad script, bad lighting, and horrible accents, killed it.  I feel I lost brain cells just watching it.  The only \\"scary\\" or \\"disturbing\\" part was Malkovich's face, which hardly ever changed into a believable expression.  Robert's accent changed from scene to scene with upsetting regularity, which was extremely disappointing.<br /><br />If the point of this movie was to show how \\"misunderstood\\" Jeckyl and Hyde may have been, it did a thoroughly awful job.<br /><br />I would recommend a root canal over this movie, as it may be less painful.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Don't get me wrong. I am sure as the year moves on, Hostel will severly drop in my \\"Best Of 06\\" list, however, since we are only in late February, to me, \\"Hostel\\" is this year's best film so far. <br /> <br />Yes, it is a horror movie. Yes, it does contain a lot of horror movie requisites (Severed limbs, blood, excessive gore, and a little T&A), however, it is not you're average horror film. <br /> <br />Hostel follows a group of travellers from the USA, who head on over to Europe, to get stoned, and to get off. They constantly search for the next thrill, and when a few Slovak girls promise to take them to a hostel where sexy Slovak girls will do anything for foreigners, they eagerly follow. Well, you can pretty much guess what happens next. Instead of beautiful naked girls, kissing the guys' feet, they are captured, tortured, and eventually killed, by people who pay x-amounts of money to capture and torture people, because it is a thrill, and a high for them. <br /> <br />Eli Roth wrote and directed a brilliant film, that raises important and intellegent questions about human nature. I don't know about you, but after I left the theater, I certainly was asking myself a lot of questions. Why are people like this? Why do they like doing this? Am I possible of doing such things!!?? <br /> <br />True, the film is brutally gory, and some people gagged, threw up, and left the theater during the film, but there is no denying Hostel's ability to increase you're threshold, and to raise great questions.
0307276902|5.0|I liked James Frey's style of writing and that he took responsibility for his actions and with all the hype he is again taking responsibility. A million little pieces was intense and has a very important message, which is not based on the authenticity of parts of the book. Any good book (even fiction) can inspire the reader to do better or be better. <br />Don't we all at some point \\"edit\\" our own stories to make us look a little different to fit the occasion? And doesn't a person through common sense determine how much one will believe regardless of the source of information? Envy appears to do the talking. <br />
B0009X7664|2.0|I ordered and returned this item twice. I returned it because the extra materials were missing. The second time I asked for a refund. It wasn't Amazons fault that the materials were not in the DVD since I recently found that few if any had the materials in them since the producer forgot to include them. Amazon however never mentioned that to me. Shame on them.
B00005JNTX|1.0|.....I would like to use. I found it to be gross, violent and the story (if any) was boring and unconnected. My biggest amazement was, that high quality actors would want to be associated with. <br />
B00005JO9J|4.0|Im not doing a review on the content, that other can do better. Im gonna complain about the appearance of the box. <br /> <br />When I first ordered this dvd, I thought it would come in a nice box with like 3-4 dvds. But instead, it come in a paper cover and a ordinary one dvd box. Doubble layer dvd. Whats that about? 387 minutes on 1 dvd (!). The only reason I get thies on dvd is to get the nice box. Like The office box or Nip tuck box sets.  <br />Otherwise, besides the \\"box\\", im really happy with the purchase.
B00005AQF7|5.0|I was almost 8 when this song came out, and lemme tell you what, I was listening to this album twice a day then, and I still listen to it a lot today. How many albums can you say that about? Today it seems like dudes is makin music in quantity, not quality. This album is a gem mint 10 out of 10. I have been a huge Snoop fan since The Chronic, and Snoop may have a different sound today, but he is still the first name people think about when they think about rap. Every song on this album is tight.
0671799320|4.0|Interesting history lessons, but time for an update. has a tendency to be long-winded.
B000063UR2|5.0|I bought this edition of Legend for my husband who is a huge fan of the movie. He thoroughly enjoyed the original director's cut version of the movie. Although, I think he and I both agreed that we still like the actual movie version that everyone saw in theaters the best. I recommend this for anyone who is an avid fan of this movie.
B000002LHX|3.0|My thinking on this soundtrack has always been, that if it was a normal Prince album, and didn't have the Batman connection, people would regard it as one of his better ones. Ok, I admit it's no \\"Sign O' The Times\\" or \\"Lovesexy\\", but it did come out at the end of what was his best decade. Even if I kept this just for the sample-filled \\"Batdance\\" and the beautiful \\"Arms Of Orion\\", it would be worth it. Toss on \\"The Future\\" and \\"Trust\\" and it's a must for fans.
0930289528|5.0|In anticipation of the movie, I decided to read V for Vendetta. I'm not sure why I didn't read it before because Watchmen and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen are two of my favorite comics of all time. Alan Moore, for some odd reason, isn't the first author to leap into my head when I'm thinking of a comic to read. However, every time I read him, I love his work.<br /><br />V is no different. Much older than Watchmen and League, it's still good. I'll admit (and Alan admits this to so don't harp on me about it) that's it's not as good in the beginning as it is at the end. Some of the characters are a little unrealized and V is just sort-of inaccessible as a character. But as the series progresses and the story gets bigger than just the killing of the people at the settlement site, everything gets better! The writing gets tighter, the characters more realized, the tension almost palatable, and the plot barreling down to the tracks to the finish!<br /><br />Lloyd's artwork is deceiving. At first, it seems simple, kind-of like David Mazzucchelli's artwork in Batman Year One did. But as you delve into it, you find that it's a complex web of shadows that gives the panels depth. If you were to see it black and white, I think you would have the \\"extreme exposure\\" that you had with Frank Miller's Sin City artwork. This is groundbreaking comic book artwork.<br /><br />The subject matter of V for Vendetta left me thinking about whether we are free or not. As I was reading it, I couldn't help but keep thinking about 1984 and The Matrix. Not that the 1999 popcorn click is in the same caliber as this work of literature but the phrase \\"The Matrix has you\\" kept dancing around in my head. V is liberating those caught in the machine, especially when he \\"helps\\" Evey! Of course, the 1984 undertones are completely visible and there's no need to go any further into that. But his discourses on anarchy are very interesting. I don't know if I subscribe to V's theories but still it's worth thinking about.<br /><br />All in all V for Vendetta was fantastic and I'm glad I spent the hours in the wee morning reading it. When I loose sleep over something this good, I don't sweat it that much! I'm eager to see how the movie turns out. I just hope they don't #@&k it up like they did with From Hell and League.t's worth thinking about. <br /> <br />All in all V for Vendetta was fantastic and I'm glad I spent the hours in the wee morning reading it.

B0000A02TZ|5.0|First of all I did not buy the Double Secret Probation Edition DVD of this film because #1 it had nothing more on it than my 1998 Collectors Edition had and #2 my 1998 version has the Original movie Soundtrack including the dont know much about history song when Bluto is having his Lunch, so i will keep my edition, if you are a purest and want the very best version (on dvd) then try to find the out of Production 1998 dvd, you will have to pay a higher price but it is worth it to get the original movie as it was meant to be, if you don't care about the originality of the music then buy the new version, it is cheap and easy to find.
0399226907|5.0|My son has loved this book since 6 months, he is now 15 months and this is his second copy (the first one was torn, eaten, etc....). It is  a cute story and teaches nature, counting and of course reading. It has holes where the catepillar \\"ate\\" through things that my son really enjoys. Highly recommended.
B00005MP58|5.0|I don't know how many are like me, intrigued by the new P&P movie but falling in love with this miniseries instead. I tried to read P&P before but couldn't finish the first a couple of pages, under a false impression coming from reading the first quarter of sense and sensibility that the heroine in P&P was also full of vanity and conceit. I was prejudiced too, hehe. So when the new movie came out I went to have a look, wondering why the novel's this popular. The Elizabeth in the movie is lovely, so is Mr. Darcy, but still not good enough to outperform Ehle and Colin whom I discovered in a searching for more P&P information. Colin Firth's eyes are so expressive, his body language is so subtle, and I doubt anyone can ever replace him as Mr Darcy. I began to re-read the novel after finishing the miniseries due to difficulty of understanding some dialogues. The heroine in the first half is very self-conscious but acceptable with witty lines here and there. She turns better in the other half where the chemistry starts to make itself apparent and draws all my attention. The hero is absolutely charming, probably because I imaged him as Colin, who is soooooo handsome and cute by the way :), from the very beginning. Unlike the movie, the plot of this miniseries keeps faithful to the novel but still refreshes us with a few new scenes those are absolutely natural and are definitely an enhancement. To those who think the wet shirt makes Darcy sextual and so degrade the taste, please watch it again without any prejudice. I don't see the wet shirt sextually seducing, actually I don't see anything related to sex. I only see a Darcy not surrounded by his pride and vulnerable to love. Oh, I can't tell how ardently I admire and love him! This miniseries is superb and I can watch it again and again and again!    The only complain goes to the DVD itself. As many already mentioned, the color fades out, and the warm tone in the original is gone. And the featurette doesn't have many contents, even no interview of the two leading roles! I'm eager to see a new special DVD coming out. Dear A&E, please give us this relief by bringing back the original color and adding more behind-the-scene's.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I rate this 3 stars, not because it's an average release but because it's an unnecessary release with what was already out there before.
068987474X|5.0|About two and a half years ago, a good friend of mine and I were out together. I had recently ended a relationship of over a year, and my friend had been bouncing from one man to another for a while as well.  We spent the majority of that day commiserating on how badly we wanted boyfriends.  <br /> <br />It was pathetic.  <br /> <br />It finally dawned on me, after the 8th time \\"I want a boyfriend\\" came out of my mouth in less than an hour that this is no way to live your life.  How can any woman in her right mind be satisfied to define herself through someone else?  I decided then that I was done feeling sorry for myself, done making excuses for bad behavior in men just to stay in a relationship of some kind so I could tell myself I was in one.  I was, in a word, Done. <br /> <br />Then a few months ago, my sister handed me this book, and as I read it my jaw dropped to the floor.  This book is the ultimate guide to being Done! <br /> <br />I have read a few of the negative reviews that mention how Greg is being unfair to the shy and timid men of the world, and I feel compelled to respond: <br /> <br />Suck it up, guys. <br /> <br />The women you seem to be pining over from afar don't realize you're there, you know. I can tell you right now, her crystal ball is probably busted.  You can't expect her to simply wait around for some sign from Heaven telling her \\"Hey! Look at the great guy in love with you over there!\\"  <br /> <br />Greg's point is that if you can't bring yourself to so much as talk to your particular Venus, you are obviously not into her ENOUGH.  It worries me that there are any number of very nice, sweet guys out there who for some reason can't bring themselves to approach a girl, but that is hardly the fault or the problem of the girl.  <br /> <br />When someone isn't calling us, or talking to us, or anything, we really honestly haven't the foggiest notion why in many cases.  All Greg is really saying is that the why isn't our concern. All we need tobe concerned about it the fact that our phone isn't ringing.  I know, it's harsh, but I'm afraid that such is the way of the world. <br /> <br />All I can say is that Fortune favors the bold. For all there is a risk of rejection if you talk to her; there is no chance she'll ever say yes if you never ask the question.
B000E8N690|5.0|i don't even listen to country music and i never really knew who Johnny Cash was before i saw the movie. But now I am a lifelong fan! The actors were amazing and the music was awesome! The story was great. I loved it! Definately see this movie. You will never regret it!
B000BHN7D4|5.0|I absolutely love this collection; it is her best. Any one that is looking for a great collection on a great artist; this is it. I for one; would have rather have other versions of her remixed songs; but they will suffice. I love Anastasia; she's a wonderful artist, a talented woman and a survivor.
B000244FDW|3.0|If you love Austen's book, you will only find this movie version tolerable. It was not true to the book.  The voiceovers took liberties at the inner thoughts of Elizabeth that Jane Austen may not have intended.  It stifles the viewer's imagination.  Watch the A&E version if you are only going to watch one (it is my favorite movie of all time).  But, if you want to watch another, this one is not completely lacking in merit or entertainment.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Enter a world of beauty, of magic, of total relaxation and enjoyment.  These women will sweep you away from whatever is on your mind, and you will awaken feeling rejuvenated.  Needless to say, I adore this cd.
B00005MP58|5.0|Pride and Predudice is my all time favorite book and this movie version brings it to life.  The movie is now my all time favorite movie and I have watched it 6 or 7 times.  This is the best adaptation of the book (and I believe I have seen them all).  You will fall in love with the characters all over again!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had a decent 42 birthday yesterday. My friend sent me 4 disks of Firefly.  I resisted watching these, the original description made the show sound like a rip-off of Han Solo.  So, I come to this show 4 years later and so sad it took this long.<br /><br />I watched 8 hours yesterday. Sometime during Disk 2 I got hooked. And as my interest grew, I noticed that the box said \\"complete\\" season, not \\"first\\" season.  I saved the last episode and the Serenity movie for tonight, so my firefly-topia isn't over yet.<br /><br />I didn't get it at first.  How can you mix Space Age technology with Gunslingers and the Old West?  As the series progresses, you come to realize the Old West type planets are the outlying settlements away from the \\"Core\\" as they call it.  Human colonies staking a hold on new planets, similar to the settlers migrating from mature European cities to colonize America.<br /><br />There is a strong bond of camaraderie among the small ship crew that is tested again and again.  The banter of dialog is appreciatively written for a grown-up perspective.  The lines delivered quick, spoken in tones and undertones suitable for the relationship perspectives given.  The dialog and acting are full of nuances and suggestions, raising the talent to a level that outshines its humble yet lovely theme song.<br /><br />The brother/sister characters, River and Simon(the doctor).  The madness of River, makes this relationship reminiscent of Hamlet.  Remember Ophelia?  Daisies for Remembrance.  They can be quite chilling together.<br /><br />The theme music can be haunting, setting up the mood for your transportation to the Firefly [uni]verse.<br /><br />This DVD collection really is a treasure for the collector.<br /><br />-Lara<br /><br />\\"i'm still free, you can't take the sky from me\\"
B000A7S4B0|5.0|It took me about 3 listens, and then I realized what was happening: I was listening to a GREAT album. I became a BRMC fan with Take Them On. I love straight ahead rock and roll. But this CD is an experience, one that moves me with EVERY listen. This is what happens when a band is able to stretch, and deliver. Rock/folk/gospel, whatever. It doesn't matter how you categorize the songs or style. The BOTTOM LINE is how it makes you feel. Them, I saw them in Philly (Theater of Living Arts). Awesome. This is Black Rebel's classic (so far). Every song is great. Don't know where to begin, but the beginning.   SHUFFLE YOUR FEET: you will look forward to putting the CD in your car, and get started with this song. Drive, by yourself, or with others.  You'll want to dance, sing, and shout. HOWL: beautiful, powerful song. The low notes are great. DEVIL'S WAITIN: continue on the journey.  AIN'T NO EASY WAY: Time to rock, time to boogie. You'll be singing in your car: I promise you. STILL SUSPICION HOLDS YOU TIGHT: reminiscent of Bob Dylan. Smooth. FAULT LINE: all I can say is \\"wow\\". Great, great song.  PROMISE: this song makes you feel good. What great songwriting sounds like. WEIGHT OF THE  WORLD: I'm telling you, the CD gets better and better. It's incredible. RESTLESS SINNER: includes the best line on the CD -- can't recall it verbatim but the one about being with the blind to find a place to hide his gold. Awesome line. GOSPEL SONG: took me a few listens to let go, and embrace this beauty. I'm glad I did. COMPLICATED SITUATION: the harmonica makes you feel part of the world. And the title says it all. SYMPATHETIC NOOSE: instant classic.  THE LINE: coming to the end of the journey with a great, pensive closer. And do not miss the bonus track OPEN INVITATION: you will listen to this a few times and want to sing it. Then, you will want to start the CD all over. ROBERT, PETER, NICK, congratulations, and THANK YOU.  dougleshner05@yahoo.com
B000BT97AO|5.0|Not that I was expecting anything all that impressive but the 2005 rendition while certainly better than the 1994 version (not the cartoon on Fox Kids), is still a massively disappointing and shoddy attempt at adapting the comic characters on the big screen yet again.<br /><br />MirrorMask centers on Helena, a 15 year old girl in a family of circus entertainers, who often wishes she could run off and join real life. After a fight with her parents about her future plans, her mother falls quite ill and Helena is convinced that it is all her fault. On the eve of her mother's major surgery, she dreams that she is in a strange world with two opposing queens, bizarre creatures, and masked inhabitants. All is not well in this new world - the white queen has fallen ill and can only be restored by the MirrorMask, and it's up to Helena to find it. But as her adventures continue, she begins to wonder whether she's in a dream, or something far more sinister.
1400043662|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The story is mythical & real at the same time. There are some Oedipal references which were disturbing, but in those parts, the myth seemed to overtake the story. <br /> <br />I definitely look forward to reading more of this author's work.
B000E1YVZU|3.0|This movie has got some really really good music that I could listen to all night long...that is for sure, but here is my problem with this movie...at times it can seem a bit drawn out...and the biggest problem that I have is the rating (PG13). Again, as I have said before...what is with the ratings board on this one...this is not something that I would allow anyone under 16 to watch...profane, overly sexual...I am not homophobic in anyway, but I do not see the need to have homosexuality, transgendered people jammed down the throats of our young people...these kids have enough to worry about, let alone be overrun by such material. The acting was great, and again, great music, excellent storyline...but beware parents, this is not something that you may want your child to watch anytime soon.  Kids are growing up WAY TO FAST...and we wonder where they get it from???!!!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Buble's meteoric ride to the top of the music charts is a testament to music and lyrics that evoke emotion and feeling. His take on standards or his own composition contrast with others attempting to cash in on the current popularity of Darin/Martin/Sinatra era songs. It is refreshing to hear a gifted vocalist deliver songs with an honest passion that can't be faked, and to raise the awareness of these meaningful songs to the younger audiences that are hearing them for perhaps the first time. <br />Mr. Buble, stay the course, your honesty, vocal integrity and talent will surely keep you apart from those others who only look to this style of music as a paycheck. <br />Those great singers before you must be smiling down knowing that someone like yourself is carrying their love for quality proudly into the future. I say \\"Bravo Buble\\" and thank you!
0393035158|5.0|Finally a book that is unafraid of political correctness. It is so refreshing to hear the truely intellectual speaking out in this kind of medium. Sam Harris is a man on the right track to finding the answers to life's mysteries, he approaches the topics of philosophy and the human psyche with a clear, open mind. Openly criticizing the beliefs of billions of people takes gall, but backing it up with facts and rational thinking takes something else entirely; intelligence. <br />        Reading this book really struck a chord with me. Harris' ideas are things I've been trying to put to words for a while. Everyone who has ever belived the nonsense that is religion should pick this book up. <br />        Any objective criticism of this book that you might have read is born of misunderstanding of Harris' points. This book isn't suggesting we implement laws against religion, its only making us aware of the consequences of a world with both 14th century religious beliefs and 21st century nuclear weapons.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|I'm an older player who grew up on Clapton, Martin Barre and all those other pre-SRV (mostly British) blues rock players. I saw Joe's band open for Tull a few years back (they were wonderful! Who is this guy who has the audacity of performing A New Day Yesterday when opening for Tull!). I've been an avid collector of his work ever since. Just purchased this DVD yesterday and, on first viewing the picture and sound looks fine. My fav songs, \\"New Day...\\" and the Blind Faith number \\"Had to Cry Today\\" rock big time. it is gratifying to see younger players take up the flame of this fine tradition of playing. If all you young players want to catch a small glimpse of blues rock as it was played in the golden age, played by a fine musician your own age, skip the boring SRV wannabes and check out Joe's DVD! It will be a great learning experience.
B000002I77|5.0|I have loved this album for years. What makes it my favorite Jazz-Rock-Fusion album is it's line-up. With the exception of two tracks featuring Ron Carter and Joe Farrell (two great Jazz musicians), the four piece group is made of two Jazz players, and two from the Rock scene. Billy and Jan are Jazz players at the core, Tommy is a Blues based Rock player, and Lee Sklar on bass is one of the great Pop-Rock studio sideman (James Taylor, Phil Collins, etc). They all come together to produce a great JRF funky sound. A lot of great JRF music is mostly played by Jazz musicians exercising their music with Rock Muscle (amplfiers, pick-ups, etc). This album gives us a fusion of different musical backgrounds. Tommy Bolin fans know that in his early days, he was in a Blues-Rock band called \\"Zephyr.\\" Some of their early stuff does have tinges of Jazz and Swing, so it didn't surprise me how well he fit with Billy and Jan. It's too bad that the core group on this album wasn't really a band. It was a one time project. I saw Billy Cobham in concert soon after Spectrum was released, and he was already on to the Crosswinds-Total Eclispe group. That outfit wasn't too shabby either.
0743454537|2.0|I was not blown away. It was like reading a soap opera script. The ending was so contrived.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|I saw Rent on Broadway with the original cast.  I loved it enough to buy the CD's.  I saw it again in LA.  I was so excited to see the movie and even more excited that all but 2 of the original cast made the movie.  The movie translated very well to the screen and the music got jazzed up too!  I recommend the movie!
B000DWMN2S|5.0|It is a MUST to see this movie. Nothing else to say.
B000002I97|5.0|What do you call a liberal country singer?  Answer:  A folk singer.  Ok, not too funny, but it's TRUE.  This album is country, all twangy and strings of steel.  But early 70's Nashville would have never embraced songs like \\"Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven Anymore\\".  I sure don't see that sentiment on CMT even today.  So John Prine just never fit in.  He left it to others to popularize his songs.   <br /> <br />I went off to college in the 70's with my Prine collection and no one knew who he was.  Eventually my roommates started listening and they would yell out \\"Play that oatmeal song!\\" (Illegal Smile).  Haven't played that one for anyone yet that didn't love that line.   <br /> <br />This album is pure genius.  Rolling Stone's album guide gives it the highest 5 star rating.  So enough said there, if you don't have this you are missing out on something.   <br /> <br />And all the previous reviews have covered the notable songs, Sam Stone, Hello in There, Paradise, etc.  Everyone will have a different favorite on an album like this because each one is great.  Personally, I am partial to Far From Me.  There have been a million breakin up songs written, but I'm not sure there has ever been one like this.  It takes you right back to the heartache of that moment when you knew a relationship wasn't going to work out.  There are two times I love Prine's songs the most, when he is hysterically funny and when he hits a nerve way down deep.  Sometimes he does both in the same song.  This album is a treasure.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|This is the third full-length album by the Gothic Metal band Within Temptation. Firstly it is very different from their very first album Enter. In Enter, the songs were much slower, longer, Sharon's voice was more wailing, and had male death vocals in. The atmosphere was melancholy and practically gothic doom. Silent force is more up-tempo, Sharon's voice has noticeably improved and there are no death vocals. The songs themselves are very dynamic, from very gothic (\\"Forsaken\\") to ballad-like (\\"Pale\\").  <br /> <br />They enjoy large orchestral symphonic strings, and gothic choral background singers add to the atmosphere. A personal favourite is \\"Jillian\\" where Sharon's voice is beautiful and crystal clear, signing to a large ensemble and the choir in the background. (I like Nightwish, but whilst Tarja's voice is overpowering opera singing, Sharon's voice is more classical) Other songs like \\"Forsaken\\", \\"It's The Fear\\" and \\"Stand My Ground\\" (the introduction) all have the memorising but slightly eerie choir singing.  <br /> <br />People don't like \\"Stand My Ground\\" for some reason: maybe because of it's mainstream popularity but I find it to be quite endearing. There is large introduction before the actual song starts.  Lot of the songs have a really big huge introductions, including \\"Jillian\\" and \\"See Who I Am.\\" <br /> <br />The slower songs \\"Pale\\", \\"Somewhere\\" and \\"The Swan Song\\" don't feature any guitars at all. All of them attribute a very gentle beat, so gentle it's barely noticeable: yet you couldn't imagine the song without it. There's a deep bass in the songs and lots of strings. \\"The Swan Song\\" has a viola in it, making it almost Celtic like. <br /> <br />The two songs that aren't very fast and heavy, but not as slow as the above three songs are \\"Angels\\" and \\"Memories.\\" The guitars though are quite heavy. \\"Memories\\" is very pretty, with the pianos, violas and strings and whispering near the end. <br /> <br />This is a brilliant album, with lots of atmosphere.I think it is the strings and pianos, which give it the most atmosphere and depth.
1594200106|5.0|It is almost impossible for me to put into words the emotional impact that this book has had on me. I have loved various books and authors all my life, everything from Tolkien's trilogy to Nelson DeMille's suspenceful thrillers. However, before reading this book, I did not think it would have been possible for me to ever say that I had a \\"favorite\\" book.<br /><br />  That has all changed... I finished The Shadow of the Wind today, and can honestly say I have never read a book like it. It is the BEST...no comparison...and I will always hold dear to my heart the many hours of joy its pages provided for me. Ruiz Zafon writes with such flowing metaphors that I was instantly transported to the streets of Barcelona and walked alongside Daniel and Fermin. I laughed outloud, and also shed tears and cried over some passages... but in the end I am left with such incredible inner joy that I was so privileged to have had the opportunity to read this book.
B0000025F7|5.0|With Disco Songs n Ballads this is hot all the way through! \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\" \\"Rock With You\\" are easily up there as my fav's of the album, but dont go past what else \\"Off The Wall\\" has for u! oldschool mj brought us some more to dance to! \\"Working Day And Night\\" \\"Get On The Floor\\" \\"Off The Wall\\" and \\"Burn This Disco Out\\" will defidently get you off ur seat n dancing ! but \\"Off The Wall\\" doesn't stop there......\\"Girlfriend\\" \\"She's Out Of My Life\\" \\"I Can't Help It\\" and \\"It's The Falling In Love\\" continue where the 1st half left off and completed an MJ album that will never be forgotten!
0307276902|1.0|I read this book before all the controversy.  Had I posted a review it would have been a 5 star.  But in light of all the true facts that have come out about this I can't give it any more than one star.  If you read this and you think it is a true or almost true memoir,I can forgive a few fudges, you are blown away at what one person could overcome.  However to know major portions of the book are fabricated, unsubstantiated and just as made up as a unicorn, it's a lot more to swallow.  Mr. Frey has enormous talent.  They have a whole fiction side of the bookstore last I checked.  This book may not have done as well being fiction but atleast then it would have been honest.  I was so excited to read \\"My Friend Leonard\\" to see how this remarkable young man righted himself to were he was today but now I can't even get past the first page knowing it is all lies.  Was there even a Leonard? I guess we'll never know.
B0000025RI|5.0|\\"Thriller\\" is easily 1 of the best albums ever made, i rate all the tracks 5 out of 5 and thats simply because there just great songs !! i love every song on \\"Thriller\\" and i'm very sure that many others feel the same!, you can't even compare this 2 any other artists albums due 2 the fact that hardly anybody can hold a full album and make as many hits out of it like he did. <br />it's too hard to even pick my fav song! i'd end up just naming them all anyway.....everyone has heard the major hits so i'll name a couple must listen to songs --> \\"Baby Be Mine\\" \\"P.Y.T\\" \\"The Lady In My Life\\" and of course \\"Human Nature\\" ! which is easily 1 of the best songs MJ has ever recorded! :)
B00003CXA2|5.0|I've watched the VHS version of this movie at least a dozen times. The DVd is even better. this is probably the second best work by Tom Hanks, Saving Private Ryan would be the first.

B00003CXCT|5.0|BRIEFLY STATED:  <br /> <br />'THE' classic, modern \\"Space-Opera Fantasy\\" for literally everyone. Yes, like many others I find George Lucas a little hard to take, but I do like this trilogy and I just hope he stops tinkering with it.  <br /> <br />LUCAS SAID IN AN INTERVIEW - \\"FILM EDITING IS NEVER FINISHED, IT IS JUST ABANDONED\\":  <br /> <br />Okay, fine, let's not think that this idea of his, to constantly tinker with these, the most profitable films of all time, is motivated by copyright laws that protect each update for the next 50 or 75 years! Well, I am starting to have trouble believing that his tinkering has anything to do with our enjoyment and that is coloring the whole \\"Star Wars\\" experience.  <br /> <br />ABOUT THE DVD: GREAT SOUND AND VIDEO! <br /> <br />The transfer is sensational and it is in widescreen. It does, however, include changes and additions that are sometimes disturbing. Perhaps, the most disturbing of his tinkerings was at the end of \\"The Return of The Jedi\\", where Lucas not only changed the scene, the setting, and the music, but he even changed the face of Anakin Skywalker's ghost to match Hayden Christensen, the 'NEW' and 'IMPROVED' Anakin Skywalker character! There are so many such examples that to enumerate them would probably injure anyone reading this review's enjoyment of the film trilogy.  <br /> <br />SPECIAL FEATURES: TOO MANY SPECIAL FEATURES <br /> <br />The main 2.5 hour featurette is for the most part excellent and, though subjective, very interesting. The three other featurettes, however, are another story. They basically tell three 20-minute tales from different viewpoints about how George Lucas was on a \\"Mercy Mission\\" of sorts as a filmmaker when he (with the force as his ally) took on the big studios to become a big studio himself. As a sort of parody on his Star Wars franchise, I like to think of the scene in the \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" where Ewan McGregor as the new and improved Obi-Wan Kenobi screams, \\"You were the chosen one --- you were supposed to destroy the Sith, not join them!\\", to the new and improved Anakin Skywalker in a dramatic moment. It seems that Mr. Lucas may have followed in Anakin's footsteps.  <br /> <br />3 FEATURETTES: PROPAGANDA IS NOT SOMETHING VIEWERS SHOULD PAY FOR  <br /> <br />In the featurettes, we saw testimonials from many of \\"Industrial Light and Magic's\\" leading customers like James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson and Ridley Scott. Each in their own words described how Lucas and \\"Star Wars\\" revolutionized the motion picture industry and forever improved everything in the world for everybody, but especially for filmmakers and moviegoers.  <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE: I WISH LUCAS WOULD JUST STICK TO FILMMAKING  <br /> <br />I wish Lucas -- who is widely known as the proverbial \\"closed-mouthed man\\" and as such a very poor communicator who is silent when he should speak and often picks the wrong time to talk -- would learn when not to speak up. These featurettes, though stunningly well made, were clearly the wrong venue for Lucas to go on a personal diatribe while bragging about how he owns all the rights and has made riches beyond measure.  <br /> <br />IN THE END: THE STAR WARS TRILOGY IS A WONDER OF THE MODERN WORLD  <br /> <br />When you look at the movies alone, however, this trilogy is a wonderful work of art that was exceedingly well done when it was made long ago and far away. We might all enjoy and appreciate the films on that basis.  <br /> <br />
0316172324|3.0|Maybe 3 stars is too low, the book had a really great premise, that our subconcious intervenes way more than we realize. Maybe it's mainly because I'm usually a fiction reader but I felt like I had to push to finish the book, and the only reason I kept going to the end was because it was the choice of my book club. Like I said, the premise was good and I did take away much food for thought. At first I felt that I should trust my inner-judgemental mind as one who would cut through the minutia to the truth. But, as the book went on, I realized that he was telling us we also needed to be very careful as that \\"truth\\" is very much influenced by our outlook on life -- in otherwords a snap decision can be very prejudiced and therefore wrong. I guess my reason for only giving it 3 stars is that I felt that Gladwell used many, many, many examples to get across the same idea, again and again and again. Each of the examples were good, but I think it could have easily been about half as long with his point well expressed.
B00080ZG10|5.0|STATED BRIEFLY: BEST BIOPIC I HAVE EVER SEEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CITIZEN KANE!    Of course, \\"Citizen Kane\\" is about a fictional character, so it is not really the same. Nevertheless, somehow, this film depicts Howard Hughes as being a kind of self-made Citizen Kane.    \\"You get a sense of Howard Hughes being Icarus with the wax wings. Those wings were great for a while, but he flies too close to the sun.\\" - Director, Martin Scorsese      BRILLANT EXECUTION OF A FILM THAT'S TOO LARGE FOR LIFE:     Scorsese's undertaking, a sympathetic portrait of the rise and fall of a great-though-enigmatic American, needed a special formula which Scorsese executed, making \\"The Aviator\\" all the more compelling in the process.     Unlike films like \\"Giant\\" with James Dean which featured a strong beginning which then needed a rushed second reel to meet time constraints, \\"The Aviator\\" fleshed out that first reel without constraint and effectively touched on all the salient issues that made Howard Hughes great while clearly and fairly illustrating the tragic darkness which progressively sowed the seeds for his eventual fall. Having seen his trials and tribulations which fairly depicted the reel meat of his life climaxing with his subcommittee testimony, we're ready for a fast-though-appropriate ending using the device provided by his illness -- \\"THE WAY OF THE FUTURE\\". It was a very clever device to thematically end the movie while, at the same time, including everything the film needs in what essentially could be considered the first reel. In this manner, Scorsese was able avoid compromise in the content, scope, and length of the film while keeping the studio and easily-bored moviegoers from coming out of their skin due to the film's length. The nearly-3-hour film went fast and played like a tragic Comet or like the \\"Icarus\\" of mythology, which is exactly the way it should have been as its style seemed to be a complement to Howard Hughes' life.     -----* AT THE END - IT WAS ALL OVER --    SCORSESE SPARED US THE PAIN OF WITNESSING HUGHES' WANING YEARS -     Without having to see the next 25+ years of the amazing aviator's life, we had enough good lifestyle material and retrograde hints to see where Hughes' life would eventually take him. Having already seen the major and most interesting highlights of Hughes' life, we had enough to fill in the conclusion without actually seeing it. In so doing, Scorsese avoided what would have been tedious, painful, overly long, and redundantly superfluous. It is truly another Oscar-worthy turn at directing for Scorsese.     ABOUT THE ACTING: NO SHORTAGE OF TALENT - BIG NAMES OR EFFORT     Here is an incomplete list of the superb cast of \\"The Aviator\\":     Leonardo DiCaprio - Howard Hughes   Cate Blanchett - Katharine Hepburn   Kate Beckinsale - Ava Gardner   John C. Reilly - Noah Dietrich   Alec Baldwin - Juan Trippe   Alan Alda - Sen. Ralph Owen Brewster   Ian Holm - Professor Fitz   Danny Huston - Jack Frye   Gwen Stefani - Jean Harlow   Jude Law - Errol Flynn   Adam Scott - Johnny Meyer   Matt Ross - Glenn Odekirk   Kelli Garner - Faith Domergue   Frances Conroy - Mrs. Hepburn   Brent Spiner - Robert Gross   Stanley de Santis - Louis B. Mayer   Edward Herrmann - Joseph Breen   Willem Dafoe - Roland Sweet   Kenneth Walsh - Dr. Hepburn   J.C. MacKenzie - Ludlow     There was a lot of sensational acting here, but Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes truly makes the movie and becomes \\"The Aviator\\"!     ABOUT SCORSESE'S APPROACH TO DIRECTING THIS MASSIVE PROJECT:    Scorsese effectively uses a neat device in fictionalizing where the beginning and usually the end of a dramatized occurrence or theme of a scene is framed by events we can see are clearly biographical facts. For example, we see Howard Hughes burning all his clothes in a very dramatic scene after Katherine Hepburn informs him that \\"she has found someone else\\". Scorsese makes it clear by the consistent manner of his presentation that this did happen. The break-up was 100% certain while the burning of the clothes in the manner depicted was probably extrapolated from the kind of facts that detectives use. The scene is closed with a 2 A.M. phone call from Hughes' to his trusted business manager Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly). Hughes demands that Dietrich go to J.C. Penney's and get him some clothes. He describes the garments needed and then vacillates between J.C. Penney's and Woolworth's, finally deciding on Sears. This part of the scene probably happened exactly as shown and Scorsese makes that clear with hints like \\"Are you taping me?\\" permeating the phone conversation. That simple \\"Are you taping me?\\" puts a fine point on the growing paranoia that has always been present in Hughes' mind and represents just one of the many methods Scorsese utilizes to get the most mileage out of his script.     -----*- OVERALL     This is one of the best films I have ever seen. \\"The Aviator\\" is a superbly appropriate treatment of the life of a great man who most definitely can be defined by his rise and fall and the components that influenced both. This film most dramatically and effectively casts a bright light on the character of the man that was a giant of very different proportions from anyone who has come into the light before or after him. Scorsese clever portrayal of balance in Hughes character by illustrating the fluctuating emotional states that influenced many of the important events of Hughes' life, is what really puts this film ahead of other epic biopics.    THE DVD: 2 DVD SET is a best buy!    PERFECT AUDIO AND VIDEO - MANY FEATURES: some pertained to Hughes' mental illness etc.
0385507755|1.0|I am someone who read this book after all the contraversey came out and still had to detach in order to review this book.  To detach meant the book literally fell short every time and on the floor.  By definitiion every word in an autobiography should be tree.  Now the aurthor is calling it a memoir then he goes back and calls it an autiobiography.  One thing  of note, the aurthor has become unhinged a bit.  What I can say is this book would have held a lot of power to me had it been true but ti's not.  And the lies that are told are in pivoatol parts of the boook.  This isn't one of those cases where one can over look a few things and take the rest.  Having seen the author in media interviews and in print he literally through his words destroys his earlkier ones in this book and it's of no value to anyone except perhaps on how to con people but to be a bit smarter about it.  Good or bad no matter what I say this book is climbing up the charts even after Oprah paid the \\"enraged\\" teacher\\" and the author was her  \\"student\\" who cheated on her.   To watch that show one would have thought it was Opah who was looking to clear her name rather then to challenge this author which id what I'd do so I could give an honest review and discuss that depth \\"he pretends to have\\" and that which he really does.
B00000IBVC|3.0|This production has some pluses and some drawbacks. <br /> <br />First the pluses. <br />The costumes in this production are radiant and colorful.  Very vivid and indeed opulent looking. <br />The setting from Beijing makes the opera even more exotic in nature. <br /> <br />Now for the negatives <br />Both the soprano and the tenor singing the role of Turandot and Calaf only did a so-so job in my opinion.  The soprano is underpowered and sounded very strained especially during the \\"grido\\" and the riddle scene, which is not an ideal Turandot since this is the most exciting part of the opera.  The tenor is also underpowered.  Not only that, he makes some weird facial expressions when he was singing which I find very distracting.  Although the costumes were good I don't think some of them are appropriate.  Calaf was not suppose to be Chinese yet his costume was Chinese looking.  As to the slave girl Lui's costumes, again it was too chinese and looks too ravishing to be a slave girl's outfit. <br /> <br />Overall not a turkey, but there are better productions out there especially in the singing department.  Try the MET production with Eva Marton in video/DVD or buy the Sutherland or Nillson set in CD.  For one of the best \\"In Questa Reggia\\" ever sung, try Dame Eva Turner's version.

And when you read any text try to understand its overall context and its ultimate intention and look up complex words in dictionary. By the way no translation  of Quran can be called the actual Quran. Quran has been revealed in Arabic and has been 100% unmodified since its inception. (unlike some other similar books that gets modified every other century or so). <br /> <br />More importantly, you will find what you look for. <br />If you read the Quran with no prejeduice then you will find the truth. Further, Quran verses are linked to the matters of their time and occurances and just like any other document should be cosidered in its entire context. <br /> <br />While the translation can vary based on the translator and his time, the actual Quran in Arabic has been constant. So true understanding can be found only in Arabic Quran. But English translation is I guess third to none.
B000089RVX|5.0|Why 5 stars you ask for an (at the time) overly played radio friendly band with a ghost like goth chic as the lead singer?  Well I'll tell you because I actually listen to the entire CD without having to hit the skip button.  Contrary to some other reviews, they do not sound like every other band out there.  Name how many rock bands (that normal society is aware of) that have a female lead:  No Doubt(when they existed), Garbage (another pale white chic with red hair this time), the one hit wonder Cardigans, and maybe a few more.  Evanescence does not sound anything like them.<br /><br />  Yes you can and will sing along with the tunes on this album whether you agree with her so-called pain or semi-religious overtures or not.  It's catchy, it's meldromadic and the band compliments each other quite well.  In fact 2 of the songs on the album are totally out of character been rather slow and thought provoking to show that maybe this girl can do something else besides just rock.  After all Ms Lee was the best thing on that Seether record \\"Broken\\".  It appears this girl can really sing (never heard them live that's why I said appears).  Before anyone jumps to the mike to state that the studio can make anyone sound great, keep in mind you have to have something to work with.  Example, Christina Aguilera (actual singing talent), Britney Spears (looks hot in spandex, no other known talent).

0307276902|5.0|Ok, I don't really mean that (I love you Oprah) but I will point out that I was about half way into the novel when the Oprah special came on and she was bashing Frey about his novel and she dropped some information about an important charactor that I was not aware of and it just ruined a big chunk of the novel for me because I knew how it would end.  That said...leave this guy alone.  I don't want to write a review based on the controversy surounding this novel and my stance but I do want to say that just because this guy embelished a bit does not take away from the strength of his words.  Just because not EVERYTHING is true does not for any minute mean EVERYTHING is false.  He still went through quite a bit and just because he didn't serve 6 months in jail doesn't mean he didn't go to rehab.  Let me ask you, does the story take place in prison?  Is he talking about his time he spent behind bars?  NO!  He's talking about the time he spent in rehab and how that experience changed his life and thats whats important.  How his attitude was changed by his suroundings and the people who helped him and the greater love of his family that he had grown so distant from.  The effect this memoir has is a possitive one and should be rendered as such.  James Frey pulls no punches and doesn't try and make himself look good.  he comes across as a pompus jerk and I'm sure thats how he was.  Maybe he wasn't as much (...)as he tried to make himself out to be but I'm sure he was still a jerk and the point of the novel is to show how taking a look at your life will humble you and change you, make you a better person if you so want to be.  Freys raw honesty in his writing is unique and may take some time getting used to, but it's apowerfull tool in adding a sense of reality to what your reading.  You don't feel as if you reading a work of fiction but rather a mans journal entrys as he recounts the events in his day.  You will see the change this man takes as the chapters unfold.  I recomend this read because it reaches a level not many other books can.  This should not be read as an exact account or an autobiography but rather one mans message, one mans journey to recovering from the state he's been in most of his life.  Some of this may be embelished, some parts may be altered but the point of this novel, the central morale is still the same.  James Frey was an alcoholic and drug addict and a criminal, and he overcame that.  He overcame all obsticals and is now sober.  This is how he got there.  GIVE HIM A BREAK...READ THIS BOOK...it's good for you.

B00005JOFO|5.0|This film stands tall as one of the best love stories ever written, filmed and acted in a long time.  The acting on all fronts is spot on and thats important in a film of this magnitude.  From Ennis and Jacks lovetorn relationship to Alma and her broken spirit upon realizing her husbands ways you are drug down into their lives, into their hearts and then shattered upon impact.  When watching this film you can't help but see yourself, see who you are on the inside.  No, this may not mean you see yourself as a homosexual man living a lie, but you can see the true intentions of the heart, you can see your life through eyes yet unseen.  I guess the best way to put it is this.  As has been said by many a critic, this film is a universal love story.  Yes I agree that it is mainly about the gay community and their stiving towards acceptance, but it really is so much more than that.  This film is not about a man loving a man or a man loving a woman but more a film about a man loving...plain and simple.  It's not about who he loves or how he loves but it's about him being able to really love someone.  Jack and Ennis found what one can rarely find these days, a love that transends time and rules and boundrys and even death.  These two men really were in love.  The brilliance here is in the depth of each charactor.  Ennis (played brilliantly by Heath Ledger) is reserved and cautious, afraid of his feelings, afraid of his heart because his heart is not something accepted by the world he lives in.  Jack (Gyllenhall) is the opposite, ready and willing to give himself, devote himself to Ennis at all costs.  To me, the star of this film is Jake Gyllenhall who gave a powerhouse performance and really proved to be the emotional core of the film.  He was a man lost in the times, lost in the way things were even though he just wanted to be loved by the one person he truly loved.  Is that a crime?  I can appreciate this film and appreciate the story it relates because I think every oneof us has felt one way, anyway, that wasn't accepted by others, that was looked down on by others and yet maybe we weren't strong enough to keep pushing through.  Maybe we buckled under and gave into what other expected of us.  This is a beautiful story of two men who needed to be loved and needed to be accepted.  They found love and they found acceptance but it came with a price...but as the film, to me at least, shows so well is that that price is worth it's weight in gold if it means being happy.  These men never got to enjoy that bennifit because they never took hold of what they had.  They allowed society and what society thought to break apart what they could have had.  Ennis, more so than Jack, allowed his own fear to clowd out his heart and that drove him away from Jack, not because he didn't love him (just watch his heartwrenching scene after he walks away from Jack...as he crouches down in the ally)...no, he loved Jack but he was afraid of what man would do to him, what society would do to him, and I feel that he loved his wife, he loved her and didn't want to hurt her.  He knew being with her was the politically correct thing to do even though the lie of a life he was leading was killing them both.  Let that be a lesson to all of us.  If we know how to be happy, screw what anyone else thinks or says...do that thing that completes you...be happy because a life lived alone inside is the worst life to live.   <br /> <br />*I do want to point out that the exclution of Anne Hathaway in every award cerimony is a bit harsh.  She turned out a steller performance that I feel was overlooked because of all the attention Miss Williams is receiving...Anne would have been a welcome replacement for McDormand or Kenear at this years Oscars.  I just wanted to state that.*

I wish Woody could get with some better soundtracks.  Overall, FANTASTIC!!!!!!
6301954947|4.0|Boy, I've been waiting for this movie in DVD for years.  I mean, the producers aren't going to lose any money; I've got credit on my Mastercard at this very second!  Like the Russian version of \\"War and Peace\\", the movie leaves me breathless, and a bit rattled.  I won't repeat the story over again, you're likely snoring by now from all the previous reviews, but I'll say that I love this movie, and it would complete my collection of war epics once I've got my eager hands on the DVD version.   <br /> <br />Much like many Eastern European movies, \\"Waterloo\\" seems disjointed in some parts, even surreal, and clearly, some of the battle scenes were borrowed from \\"War and Peace.\\"  I forgive you Sergei, just don't do it again.  The part when Napoleon's Old Guard march shoulder to shoulder to anhiliation, is simply incredible.  I could actually smell the cordite from the cannons, the fear and confusion in every French heart.  I got chills from this scene.  Rod Steiger looks like he's on drugs.  Despite is super acting as Napoleon, he looks spaced out sometimes, or perhaps worried that the movie will flop.  Yet, he pulled it off, he WAS Napoleon Bonaparte in all his menace, his mood swings, his pride, his appearance (though it's rumored that Steiger is nearly 6 feet tall, when NB was just shy of 5 feet).  Must have NP's ego that made him seem larger than life.  In conclusion: I urge all history buffs to demand the 3 hour DVD version, anything shorter would be a rip off, or go sulk in the dark like me.  <br /> <br />One final note: I have a 47 inch Panasonic projection HDTV.  The wide screen brings epic movies to real life.  I hope the DVD version is not tarnished like some parts of \\"War and Peace.\\"
076790592X|5.0|This true story impacts lives of all its readers. While Morrie was dying, I felt sad but at the same time happy, because he was so strong and unafraid of death. He battled through his pain to tell Mitch and the lives of others how to live life to the fullest with no regrets. He told everyone the way life should be and how to overcome many problems. <br />Morrie's many lectures were different every Tuesday with Mitch and connected even with me. I felt as if Morrie was talking to me too. His kind, honest words touched and helped my aspect on life and how to change the way I am for the better.  <br />This book is definitely two thumbs up! I recommend it to all people, ages 12 and up because those ages would be able to understand what Morrie tries to portray. This is one of those books that you want to read until you are finished without putting it down. I guarantee anyone who tries reading this book will enjoy and want to pass it on to friends and family. \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" by Mitch Albom is absolutely one of the best, most touching books I have ever read. <br />
0393327655|5.0|The time has come for people to open their eyes. <br /> <br />I just finished \\"The End of Faith\\" and must say that this is an all important book that everyone should at least give a go with an open mind.   <br /> <br />I do not question faith, nor do I beat it to a pulp, which allowed me to gently wander through the book without questioning any of his motives.  He does a great job of analyzing a variety of cultures and their faith leaving me - at times - flabbergasted.   <br /> <br />So, without delving into the politics of atheists/theism, etc. I'd like to recommend this book as an essential read for anyone who - like myself - has questions about faith and is looking for an unbiased answer. <br /> <br />3 weeks ago I was digging for a book that delves into religion while giving some insights as to how/what effect it could potentially disperse into our world if not treated with respect and care.   <br /> <br />After this read, I've come to the conclusion that religion - the cause/reason - will be the end of our world if we continue to walk blindly.

038572179X|1.0|I hate everyone in this book. The author's writing style is irritating at BEST. I had to \\"read\\" this book for my book club and the woman who selected this book and I are going to have very stern words over her choice in books in the future. I listened to the audio format of this book and I usually go through a book this size in two days MAYBE three. This book has taken me *4 weeks* to get through, because I keep falling asleep at my desk. <br /> <br />I cannot empathize with a single charicture. I don't care about a single one of these people, and half way through the soliders march I wanted all of them to blow up so I could be done with them and feel some sense of revenge for how much time this book stole from me. <br /> <br />Reading this book makes you feel like you have Alzheimer's.  <br /> <br />You can be trudging along at a snails pace and then \\"Oh by the way\\" you're throw in to a flashback or a second view, without a single hint of a transition. You spend half your time reading this book rereading paragraphs because you don't understand how you got from the dining room at the high of drama, to suddenly earlier in the day on a bridge from a different charictures point of view!  <br /> <br />You get so bored reading this drivel only to have the whole setting change on you, but you're half a asleep so while you kind of don't care, you're pissed because no one in this stupid book does anything of interest.  <br /> <br />Postscript: I am unable to resell my CDs as out of complete frustration and hatred, as I repeatedly through the box containing the audio CDs against the wall of my office. So I guess, unless you need a good \\"anger management-flinging book\\" ...

B00003CWPL|4.0|I have been a David Lynch fan every since I saw his version of Frank Herbert's sci-fi classic, \\"Dune\\" on the big screen back in the mid-eighties.  Although it was met with mixed reviews, I just loved the whole visual appearance and the mysterious, brooding atmosphere of the film.  During the time between then and now, I had somehow managed to see and enjoy all of Lynch's major works except for this one, although I had been aware of it.  This is definitely the most avant-garde of his features (way more so than even Lost Highway).  If you're not a fan of movies that play with metaphor and symbolism, you may not like it.  In my opinion, it's not going to be terribly accessible to a majority of viewers.   <br /> <br />On the plus side, it's a virtual candy store for those who like to experience a film in a visceral, subjective sort of way and who do not necessarily need to have all (or even any!) answers wrapped up and neatly packaged by the time the credits role.     <br /> <br />That doesn't mean we can't have some fun puzzling over Henry's strange quasi-world and try to draw some conclusions from it.  Some questions I find myself asking: who is Henry really and what does he represent?  What is the meaning of the strange string like creatures that keep showing up?  I have come to interpret the image of the dark planet as a sort of anti-Earth, and the man pulling the levers as one of the ambiguous and dark allusions to \\"men behind the scenes\\" who frequently turn up in Lynch films.  They are the secret manipulators.  The real powers that be.  Who is the lady in the radiator?  I interpret her as one of Henry's alter-egos or possibly Henry's desire to escape.  \\"In heaven everything is fine,\\" she sings.  I think escape may ultimately represent death, but that (like everything else) is up to interpretation. <br />  <br />Another of Lynch's favorite themes in the film is the stark, industrial feel to this world.  Henry lives in a grim place of factories and pumping stationsand concrete and grime and loud noises made by mostly unseen machines and unknown entities.   Eraserhead is presented in black and white.  It lends to the feeling of fear and uncertainty that we empathically feel for Henry. <br /> <br />Typically I've enjoyed how Lynch can take the common place and give it a twist into the surreal.  By the end of Eraserhead, I find myself wondering if maybe I'm just not \\"getting it\\", but maybe that's the point.  Like an abstract painting, the meaning is subjective, and that's half of the fun of the experience. <br />

0345440900|5.0|Wow.  I've read everything (Pantley, Weissbluth, Karp, Mindell ...) --and taken bits from each author.  But, this is by far the best book I've found. <br /> <br />By using her methods to recognize my babies' general temperment, I was able to recognize how easily over-stimulated she was, and tone down her environment accordingly.  I can't tell you the difference just THAT made. <br /> <br />At 2 weeks, all most babies do every day is eat, sleep, and have bits of awake time.  But, by putting these into a predictable sequence (E.A.S. ...), my baby became noticeably more calm and secure.   <br /> <br />I can't say enough good about this book.  Ofcourse, I didn't fall perfectly in line with ever word of it.  But, the author doesn't seem to expect the reader to.  I love how she says, \\"If it's not broken, don't fix it!\\".  Or, \\"If you've found something that's working well for you and your baby--by all means don't change it\\".  How refreshing!   <br /> <br />Regarding breast feeding, I didn't find her to be \\"against it\\" at ALL.  She was just more factual--and less emotional in her language about it.  I breast fed for 18 months--and, didn't feel at ALL at odds with this book.
B00005JO9J|3.0|This med drama is, apparently by design, quite over the top - almost to the point of hilarity: everybody is sleeping with everybody, in broom closets,etc., everything is stat, a bomb blows up every second or two. There is, literally, never a dull moment. It's all fairly laughable but, at the same time, muy entertaining...Whattaya expect? Anything with Patrick Dempsey is going to be, by definition, a cheezfest.
0312084986|5.0|I can't imagine a reader finishing this delightful tome without wishing he had become a veterinarian.  The message from page to page is the writer's love for his profession.  Herriot is such a sweet spirit in his relationship with family, friends, clients, partners and patients.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this book; it'll give you several hours of smiles and chuckles.
B00005YW4H|3.0|...in retrospect, I'm not really sure why this was so huge and caused so much commotion. I fully jumped on the bandwagon, drank the kool-aid, etc., at the time, but now...now, for me, this hasn't held up... I pulled it out the other day to listen to and it seemed so inert and workmanlike...hmmm, maybe it's time to put it in the trade-in pile....

B000002UVX|5.0|A high school buddy turned me on to this when it came out on vinyl and it remains a favorite Hendrix recording of mine. It's funky and it rocks. Sure, Mitch Mitchell might be a better drummer than Miles but Buddy's in the pocket groove is what Jimi needed on this disc and it meshes beautifully with Cox's funky bass playing.<br /><br />The track 'Machine Gun' is a tour de force of guitar playing. Only Jimi could pull off something like this. I love Mitch Mitchell's drumming but Buddy's backbeat really holds things down beautifully. The beginning of 'Power To Love' is pure Hendrix.<br /><br />This is probably my favorite 'air guitar' CD. It is no mistake that some of the best and most well known guitar players continue to cite Jimi as an influence. He was ahead of his time. I can't say this is his best recording but for me it's one of my favorites and will remain so. JIMI FOREVER FOREVER JIMI<br /><br />[...]

0300108834|4.0|It is a wonderful history book.  Well written, thoughtful and straight to the point.

B000AMWIVM|3.0|Actor-writer Leigh Whannel stars with Cary Elwes and Danny Glover in this horror-thriller in the vein of Seven. Newcomer James Wan takes on the directing duties for this ambitious, but flawed film called Saw. Financed by Lions Gate Films which is quickly earning the reputation for taking chances on small, low-budget horror films that other major studios and their independent house won't touch.<br /><br />Saw succeeds in creating a palpable dread and tension as the character of Adam (Whannel) and Lawrence (Elwes in scenery-chewing mode) wake up with no memory of how they got into chained-up in adingy and dimly lit shower room. Slowly the two characters try to figure out why they've been chained into pipings in the room. Soon ehough a tape recorded message informs them of the situation they're in and all of it due to demented criminal who the press and the police have dubbed Jigsaw. The premise of their incarceration is simple. Jigsaw wants them to play a game where they must find clues and tools hidden around the room and escape from just in time to save Lawrence's wife and daughter. This premise and the reasoning as to why they must play this game is one of this film's strong points, but it also becomes one of its flaws as the Whannel overwrites the dialogue into trying to explain everything through the Elwes character. Whannel as a writer doesn't seem to trust his audience to solve or even understand the premise and Jigsaw. Unlike Seven which gives just enough hints and clues for people to try and solve the problem, Saw pretty much tries to give everything away. Fortunately, the story in convoluted and twisty enough that the audience might be confused by the time Elwes character over-explains everything. Saw is the kind of film that surely would've benefitted from the concept of less is more.<br /><br />The acting is average to say the least with Elwes chewing up every scene he's in. It's hard to gauge whether Elwes' performance was due to the pedestrian script he had to read from or if he thought that was what the character needed. Either way his character dominated the film even in scenes when he should've stayed in the background. Whannel as an actor is believable enough and probably a level better than as a writer. Though he was abit too subdued, but then that might've been due to the fact he had to act opposite of the over-the-top Elwes. Danny Glover makes an appearance as a burned-out cop whose earlier run-in with Jigsaw led to his partner's death and him scarred for life. Glover's seems to barely register in the film and his character seems abit tacked on to give the story an added dimension to make it complex. Horror films should really try to stay simple.<br /><br />Saw does deliver in the gore department, but not overly much. It just had enough squirm-inducing scenes in the beginning, middle and end chapters to make the film worthwhile to fans of R-rated horror. This film will not be mistaken for one of the PG-13 Japanese ghost remakes of the last five years. As stated earlier this film owes alot more to Fincher's Seven than to Nakata's Ringu series. The quick frantic beginning makes way for a middle part where too much talking and not enough horror sequences. Fortunately, the pacing speeds up once more in the last 10-15 minutes as Jigsaw's game and manipulations come to a bloody and twisted end.<br /><br />One thing to mention as a stand-out character even though he's only on the screen a limited time is the genre actor Tobin Bell who plays Jigsaw with a twisted sense of tragic nobility. As much as Jigsaw may be the demented creator of the game and trap Adam and Lawrence have been put in, it was very difficult not to admire Bell's character. He's not on par with Hannibal Lector, but he has that potential to be one of the classic cinematic villains.<br /><br />In the end, Saw was a good enough horror movie for fans of the genre. Though casual horror fans may be more shocked with the film's scenes and premise than hardened horror-aficionados. Saw could've been very good or great if not for its overexplanation of everything going on in the scene and the average acting performance of most of the cast. Tobin Bell's performance being the only real highlight of the entire group. The ending of Saw seems well-suited for sequels. I wouldn't mind seeing what new complex game Jigsaw has in mind for a new set of unworthies.ise than hardened horror-aficionados.

B0000C6K09|1.0|Like other uses have pointed out, the music are NOT conducted by John Williams nor performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, and they do NOT sound the same with the music from the movies.  You are still getting a nice collection of music, but for the REAL John Willims music, you gotta buy the original soundtracks.  These products just don't measure up to the authenticity of the glorious works by John Williams.

There is definitely some violence and gruesome detail, but the spirituality and the richness of India and the characters bring balance. You feel a great connection to the author and experience laughter, sorrow, anticipation, fear, and much more as you read.

6305903182|5.0|Scream 3 begins, in classic form, with a murder. The titles roll and you're in it for what is presumably the final time. Scream 3 pays severeal homages to it's predecessors and is probably best viewed with the other two in sequential order. The most thrilling aspect about this movie is that it's the finale essentially meaning that those surviving characters you loved from the first and second enteries might just not make it in this final outing. That aspect alone got my butt in the theater opening weekend. I was a little turned off by the \\" movie within a movie\\" plotline that sort of carries over from the second movie, but after a while it grew on me. Scream was always meant as a trilogy and delivers this by crafting the story around three pivotal points in every person's life. In part one most of the characters are in high school. Part two picks up in college, while part three takes place in the working world. It doesn't sound so clever, but not many horror movies gain this type of commitment from their stars, so that this kind of story can be fleshed out. For this and so many other reasons, I gave Scream 3 five stars, no so much because it's the best of the Scream trilogy, but because it answers some questions, provides some closure and ends happily for those that survived.
B000BT97AO|1.0|Good thing I rented it first.<br /><br />One of my great loves of film comes from the desire to be taken away to another world. To be introduced to amazing new characters and creatures. To be taken away from my 40 hours a week job, my fill up the gas run of the mill life.<br /><br />I had hoped that MIRRORMASK would do this for me, if just for 2 hours. From the makers of LABYRINTH and DARK CRYSTAL, I figured I couldn't go wrong. Yet, upon putting the DVD and starting to watch with bright eyes, I'm not sure how long it was, but my interest was gone.<br /><br />The movie is a virtual extravaganza of beautiful imagery and animation mixed with live action. Unfortunately, none of these animated characters manage to portray a single thread of emotion in me.<br /><br />MIRRORMASK is like a painting that does nothing for you. I watched the entire film and wasn't emotional moved ONE BIT. This, despite the fact that the movie is about a girl who has to find a mask in order to save the kingdom and return to her dieing mother.<br /><br />Unlike Dark Crystal, labryinth and even the Muppet movie, relation and feeling for the characters in MIRRORMASK are non-existent. This, to me, is the most important thing in a film. If you can't get into the character, the movie is a complete loss. Thus, despite all the beautiful imagery and dazzling new animation, the movie to me, was a complete and total loss.<br /><br />I want my 2 hours back.

B000E1155E|4.0|If Mike Skinner learned to play guitar like Franz Ferdinand and came from Yorkshire then I'm sure he'd sound summat like this. This is the best album you will hear this year; not because of the hype but because it is good music - witty lyrics, inventive arrangements, some mad riffs and a lot more beside. Almost every track on here is a killer - View from the Afternoon, Fake tales, Dancefloor, you probably know them all already. Will it change your life? Probably not. Will it stay on your CD player for weeks and have you singing every line? Yes indeed.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|I loved this movie so I had to buy it. It was thought provoking but satirical as well. It shed light on the arms business (US gov't being the biggest arms dealer) but it wasnt too heavy which could have made it boring. I am a huge fan of Nicolas Cage, he is so intriguing that it's hard to keep your eyes off of him. Jared Leto is another fav of mine and he did amazing in the film as well. If I had to compare this movie to something it would be Fahrenheit 9/11 because it brought issues to the table in a comedic way, which made it entertaining to watch. I highly recommend this film!!!
B000BCKFWK|5.0|Frank millers sin city was the high light of 2005. this was what films were supposed to be, unique and spellbinding. and now comes a worthy dvd. the dark stylish basin city has never been so appealing. the first disk features the orginal cut and a few special features. they don't last that long but are informative and get straight to the point. the second disk features the extended cut but there are only a few minutes added and a few seconds here and there but it's exiting to see what's been added. there are some good additions like the green screen cut of the film where you watch the film speeded up in it's orginal green screen format. but there are some strange editions like the breakfast tacos cooking school.  <br /> <br />the only real problem is the packaging. it's really flimsy and it bends easily. the copy of the hard goodbye is loose and because it moves around it only damages the packaging even more. it looks really nice but that just makes it worse when it gets damaged. <br /> <br />overall one of the best films ever made gets one of the best dvd treatments ever. <br /> <br />i wouldn't give it any lower then 5 stars because the film and extras are what i paid for not the packaging. <br /> <br />can't wait for Sin City 2 + 3
B0002DB52M|1.0|I enjoyed the portion of this movie that I allowed myself to see.  The portion I saw was charming and intriguing.  I had to stop though when the woman was raped.  Why do I have to watch a woman get raped?  You can talk about rape, and do things that tell your audience that a woman was raped, without actually showing the sex.  BTW, kids, on set, were watching that man and that woman have sex as well.  What kind of people are you? <br /> <br />The difference between art and reality is that art is pretend and reality is real.  When you force your audience to see sin though, your art passes through that barrier that exists between art and reality.  You are no longer just talking about immorality, you are actually being immoral and bringing your audience down into it as well.  I can see how this would be a pretty exciting prospect for some directors...but I'm just not interested. <br /> <br />Hey...how about this?  If you're really into that idea, breaking the barrier between art and reality, turning your audience into a bunch of sinners, then why don't you just hire a bunch of punks to beat up old women as they wait for a bus?  If you do it live, and then also show the number for the police station closest to the incident on screen, then everyone, as they sit there and watch can choose for themselves whether or not they will be good citizens and call in, or be bad citizens and just keeping watching.   <br /> <br />If you're going to tell a story, then tell a story.  If it's your intention though to permanently darken my life...and you did...I sure do wish you wouldn't.  You're hurting people...and not in good ways.  I wish you would stop.
B0000696I0|3.0|I remember when I first saw this movie when I was little and absolutely loved it. But when I saw it again recently I noticed some things the director changed in this movie. Unlike Ninja Turtles Part 1, this movie is much more light-hearted. Ralph (my favorite character in part 1) isn't the hothead like he was in the first movie and is at times a lot sillier. In fact, all the characters lightened up a bit. While this was definitely a good move for our younger viewers, overall it kinda ruined the individual characteristics of each turtle.  <br /> <br />The fight scenes are more comedy than action, and the script is mild at best. But overall, it's a great movie to watch with your little brother or cousin. <br /> <br />Good movie, but it just can't match up to the first one.

B000BKDOCA|4.0|I'm still not tired of this CD after to listening to it several times.  The remixes are phenomenal, and I suggest \\"Breathe on Me\\" and \\"And When We Kiss\\".    There's four problems that irritate me.  1 - There's no alternative CD without the software, at least a legal one that I can find.  2 - You must install the software if loading it on your computer.  It slows down your computer and can be quite a hassle to uninstall.  Any time you want to burn/rip the CD or put it on an MP3 player, you have to install it.  3 - Beware owners of iPods!  The music won't work on your iPods!  (The software company says that Apple isn't cooperating with them, but with this software, do your blame them?  Maybe someday you can eventually get them on an iPod.)  4 - I have a very strict preference of bitrates when ripping CDs (192 kbps) because it has a decent sound quality.  But you can only rip this CD at exactly 128kbps.  The sound quality isn't terrible, but sometimes you can hear where it could be better.  If you try to rip the CD without the software, etc., the ripped songs will skip and be distorted.  (The software company said they are \\"working\\" on creating an update for the software that allows users to select their bitrate.)    The software is very inconvenient, and actually quite a hassle to use.  The program can be removed from your computer with a little elbow grease and you can still listen to the songs on your computer.  However, it's not the best way to keep faithful customers!  If you don't mind the software or don't listen to your music on a computer, then go for it!  Otherwise, be prepared!

B000C65Z1G|3.0|This material must have been so much better in the form of a book.  Multi-layered and over-nuanced, with a plot that loops backward awkwardly in the beginning reel, this movie tries to touch so many bases that little is left for the viewer to connect with.    The obvious path to the heart of the movie would seem to be the title character,  Justin ( Ralph Fiennes) the mild-mannered diplomat.   He alone among the characters is unallied to cause, corruption, and conspiracy.  But Justin's unassuming sensitivity doesn't ameliorate this movie's total lack of sensual depth.    This is one of those movies that attempts to create tension by questioning its lead character's manhood.  Can doughy Justin hold on to his younger, more passionate and idealistic other half?  is he being cuckolded by a colleague, a friend, or (gasp) by a young black man?[...]    The outer (as opposed to the inner) story in \\"Constant Gardener\\" is oh so topical.  But for all of its dealing with AIDS, poverty, and the greed of multi-national corporations, does it really prick the Western conscience, or raise awareness?   I think that 2004's \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" did a far better job.   This movie employs the natives as window dressing. [...]    Maybe I missed something in not seeing this movie on a large screen, but on a small one it came across as cynical, small-hearted, superficial, and quite disappointing.
B00003CWPL|4.0|I first saw this film when I was about 18 years old. It didn't make much sense to me then, and it doesn't make much sense to me now. But I remember the fun we had as we would repeat the lines of the movie, over and over again. It never was a horror film to us, but rather a different type of satire.  <br /> <br />There are only a few parts of this movie that you might want to review prior to youth watching. The scene with the mother asking about the relationship he has with her daughter, and a scene with the lady across the hall. Other than those few scenes, this is a classic film that will keep you entertained each time you watch.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|Well...let me just say, that I've only had this album for one day...but, yes I do like it. It's weird...really weird...and amazingly unique. It shocks me how deep yet eccentric this guy is. <br /> <br />These songs are really good. My personal fav. is \\"Chicago\\"...don't know why...I guess it's just catchy. <br /> <br />Anyway...sorry this review wasn't terribly in depth, but I would certainly recommend this album to either people who like weird music or people who are bored.
0312330529|5.0|The book is named Shantaram and I have burned through its 936 pages in about two weeks.  If you don't know the book. it is based on the author's Gregory David Roberts own true story of his escaped from a Maximum Security Prison in Australia, and subsequent travel to India to find refuge among slums dwellers and the Mafia of Bombay.  <br /> <br />In Mumbai (Bombay), as a fugitive, with a new identity \\"Lin\\" (Roberts), as protagonist lives out an extensional quest for survival, freedom, and redemption so profound,  that to set such experiences into an active first person narrative, and place it within the context of the authors own intense confessions as well as an esoteric yet rigorous philosophical cosmology constitutes one of the rarest forms of literary expression. Yet Robert's managed the feat while running a medical clinic in one of the cities darkest slums and inhabiting the Bombay underworld, associating with the most amazing cast of anti-heroes and hoods. The sacred and profane populate this novel; gangsters, gurus,  thieves, standing Babas, Sufis, sinners, saints, European ex-pats are all among the odd assortment of humanity who find a home within.  <br /> <br />The plot follows Lin through a series of most fantastic adventures and incredible experiences only possible in India, or ecstatic realizations among unspeakable deprivations. This is a book about crime and its more unspeakable punishment, of despair and hope, love and betrayal. His friendships with India and its villagers, slum dwellers, sages, and his trusty companion Prabu are deeply poignant, joyful and heart wrenching. The author's deep affection for the people of the subcontinent breaths through his every word.  <br /> <br />The story is also at times even absurdly comic ( ex. A  Bombay drug store cowboy decked out in black leather and a stetson, who speaks Danish,  a Mumbai police hunt for a giant bear). The author even takes on roles in the Bollywood film industry, and in one of the more breathtaking narrations he follows his fellow gangsters to  fight in the mountains of Afghanistan as a Mujahadeen warrior (impersonating a CIA agent).  <br /> <br />As all experiences in India the events unfold in a wholly paradoxical matter full of intrigue and surprises where nothing turns out exactly as one would expect, for in a world of Maya nothing is really as it seems. The author has the rare gift to show the \\"the authentic face of India\\"; as Janus as that maybe. A country which if you travel as a tourist seems to offer you a different profile at almost every turn and encounter. In Shantaram one experiences India across the entire spectrum of its extremes, her dark brutal secret of hopelessness and wrath, as well as the fathomless compassion which sparks the flame of hope to burn eternally within her multitudes of beings.  <br /> <br />This is no where as well illustrated then in his description of the head of one of Bombay mafia family, Khader Kahn, a gangster and guru like figure with a spiritual philosophy based on modern physics and a view not unlike Teilhard De Chardin which concerns the evolution of the universe heading toward a state of maximum complexity which he terms: \\"God.\\" <br /> <br />The writing is so genuine, passionate and sincere, in its description of the tumultuous life of India's largest city and all the eccentric characters who fill it, that this in itself is worth the price of the ticket to Shantaram. No doubt, Shantaram along with some of the recent plethora of great English novels from subcontinent writers has helped to establish Mumbai and her characters as one of the worlds great literary settings of the early 21st century. <br /> <br />The story is finally about the author's spiritual transformation and search for redemption  in part as he pursues his underworld Anima, the beautiful and mysterious emerald eyed Karla, a Swiss/American also on the run, who devours novels by such authors as Mann, Schiller, Flaubert and Virgina Woolf, in their original language, and spews forth her own experiences of the fringes, in koan like musings while wandering stealthily among the teeming streets of Mumbai to facilitate the trade of guns, money, identity, and espionage.   <br /> <br />The author managed to contemplate the narrative while he was serving two years of a seven year sentence in an Australian  maximum security prison while in solitary confinement.  <br /> <br /> <br />Anyway this is great novel, I was hooked from the book's first sentence and literally could not put it down. Here is how the first sentence reads: <br /> <br />\\"It took me a long time and most of the world to learn what I know about love and fate and the choices we make, but the heart of it came to me in an instant while I was chained to the wall and being tortured. I realized, somehow, through the screaming in my mind, that even in that shackled , bloody helplessness, I was still free to hate the men who were torturing me, or to forgive them.\\" <br /> <br />(Amazingly after Roberts recorded the events in this book, he ran underworld missions in Sri Lanka, Zaire, Singapore, Italy, and was finally recaptured in Germany where he was fronting as singer for a Rock band. He was then sent back to Australia to serve out his remaining prison sentence. <br /> <br />[...] <br /> <br />( It appears that soon the story will be heading to the cinema as Johnny Depp has bought the rights and he is conspiring with Russell Crowe to make the film. Thankfully Roberts is working on the screenplay.)
B00005JOFO|5.0|<br /> <br />This is probably more of a review of \\"reviews\\"...its my comments about the movie and the other reviews I've read.  One of the best reviews I've read so far (Michael Acuna on Amazon.com) said:  \\"Love has no rules.  It happens when you least expect it, often when you don't want it, many times when you can't handle it.  It often times scares you, surprises you, shakes you down to your very core.\\"  That is a long quotation, but I think it should be put on a plaque, or at the very least on a T-shirt.  It is my new \\"favorite\\" quotation. <br /> <br /> I first went to see the movie after reading an article about it in Entertainment weekly.  It sounded good, but frankly, I was curious about how they would handle the love scenes.  And lets face it, I am sure every other heterosexual women will agree that Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are definitely good to look at.  I was shocked at my own reaction.  This movie has taken hold of me like none has before it.  It is in my soul...it haunts me.  The first time I saw it I was so mesmerized, that I didn't even HEAR the sound track.  Then I read something about the incredible music, and when I went to see it the second time, the music began to haunt me.  I got the soundtrack and have played it over and over and over.  Since then I have seen the movie again, and I hope to see it yet again before it stops playing.  I have already pre-ordered the DVD.   <br /> <br />I try to eavesdrop on comments people make as they are leaving the theater after viewing the film.   Mostly, people are just deathly quiet, as though what they have just seen has left them speechless, but the last time I saw it, a guy said to his girlfriend or wife, \\"THAT was depressing.\\"  Yes it WAS depressing, but hopefully it will open some hearts and minds.  I know it won't change the homophobes or the religious fanatics, as these narrow-minded people know no views but their own.  But it may make the people who believe that homosexuals can change if theywant to, realize that it just doesn't work.   <br /> <br />Now...the question IS, as I read in one review...are Jack and Ennis in love with each other because they are gay...or or they gay because they are in love with each other? Jack I think may be gay to the core, or at least bi-sexual.  In the opening scene, where they are standing outside the job trailer, Jack is eyeing Ennis speculatively.  Is it just curiosity about the guy he may be spending the summer working with, or is it something more?   He is the one who initiates the first contact, and he is, he is the one who seeks other homosexual relationships when he realizes that Ennis will never consent to having an \\"open\\" relationship with him.  On the other hand, maybe this is how he salves his pain and longing for Ennis.  ENNIS on the other hand I don't believe is intrinsically gay.  I believe the shock of his life was falling in love with another man.  Ennis is a man so closed off in his feelings because he lacked love and tenderness during his growing up years.   Even though he thinks he loves Alma, he is overwhelmed and confused by his feelings for Jack.  His love for Jack transforms him into another person in Jacks presence...he's more open, more affectionate with Jack than he ever is with Alma.  Part of that probably comes from Jack's own openness and playfulness, which rubs off on Ennis when they're together. <br /> <br />All in all, I think this is the most beautiful love story I've ever seen.  The short story was great too, but the screenplay's fleshing out of the wives was extraordinary.  Any comments about the movie or this review may be addressed to me at donna_read@yahoo.com.  I would really enjoy the feedback. <br />
B0000E6I1J|5.0|An absolute masterpiece of music performed by some of the best musicians of today.  A band so tight that the Harrison songs were played just about note for note.  Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton's version of \\"Something\\" is powerful.  Nobody can sing George's spiritual songs better than Billy Preston and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are fabulous.  Ringo is...well...Ringo.  A must for any Harrison fan.  5+++++ Stars
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I rarely give reviews, but seriously, this is a movie, not a history lesson. It had two hours to tell a story. The director and his posse did their homework in many ways, but they also used the medium of cinema to help move along the story as well.  <br /> <br />Take the sculpture part of the story-it was a very important part of the storytelling because of the compacted timeframe here. Lizzy in this version just got back from turning down Darcy's proposal when swoop! The aunt and uncle take her off to Derbyshire country and Darcy's pad. Hmmm, within a space of 5 minutes we have Lizzy telling Darcy he sucks, to being affected by him. If we didn't use the sculpture vehicle, she would have looked mercenary-\\"oh, look at Darcy's hot estate, I think I like him now.\\" But that's the NOT the storyline-she isn't mercenary. How is a director suppossed to convey this? <br /> <br />I think Joe Wright took advantage of the medium of cinema and bridged the timeframe gap by allowing the sculptures to convey Lizzy's realization of her prejudice, her blindness, and her awakening feelings for Darcy(look at the statues used--- a \\"veiled\\" woman, Achilles \\"the heel guy\\" statue, etc. and finally Darcy's statue.)And how long did that bridge scene take to convery regret,hindsight, self awareness, and true feelings? Like a minute! Clever if you ask me.  <br /> <br />I mean, the point is that with a compacted timeframe to tell the story, sometimes you take liberties in conveying the spirit of the story, if not the plotpoints.I thought this was a great adaption for the medium used here.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Anyone who wouldn't give this CD a five star simply does not like jazz/easy listening.  The talent here is obvious.  To put it mildly, this CD is  \\"great\\".   Just what I expected from David Foster.   What talent.  What a little doll Renee is.   She will certainly be around for a long time.  I can hardy wait for her next CD to come out and I would love to see her in concert.  No doubt Peter  Cincott is a super talent.   Can't get enough of Michael Buble' and Chris Botti.  Thanks David Foster for giving us this great music.
B000002J2B|5.0|To quote the obvious, Peter Gabriel had to leave the band, as this album would simply never have come about. I've read many reviews and wot Guerrilla seems to get a lot of stick, don't know why, I thought it was a Fine Tune. Your own special way should have been a B side and one of the \\"spot the Pigeon\\" EP tracks, inside and out, should have been included instead then you would have no complaints. <br /> <br />It doesn't matter whether Steve Hackett featured prominently or not on the Album, he features fairly evenly throughout all the Genesis Albums that he recorded on. Genesis is a group foremost then individualist. With the exception of your own special Way, the Album is excellent, Duke was the last Prog Rock Album they made, not this one, attw3 just happened, nothing more, nothing less. The one strange thing is that there was no Promo Video for any of the tracks, would have been great to see them perform to Video Format with one of there songs even if it was \\"your own special way\\". This Album and The Lamb are 2 of the best Albums recorded, not to demean the rest of the catalogue. They sound technically very Clear and loud. The great thing about this Album is that it is Underrated, That makes the Album more mysterious and Magical. I first heard this Album in 1992 and is strange how you can be the same group of guys who made both We can't Dance and W&W (I was truly gutted when We can't.. came out as it sounds soulless, I only heard the Album about 3 times since then and can't be bothered to give it another try). 1977 was a Magic Year for Genesis as W&W came out in January and Seconds out came along in October 1977, is there a live version of 11th earl of Mar  & In that Quiet Earth out there. If you like you're Music, get this album and ignore the rest of the nonsense spouted about W&W.  <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|this movie has to be the best movie that I have seen in a very long time. The fact the creaters of this movie dippected the lifes of two unopenly gay men shows that the lifes of gay people are starting to show up more in the movies. <br />
B000784WMW|5.0|It's a real treat to have BBC's \\"Jane Eyre\\" on DVD.  Timothy Dalton is excellent as Rochester - - brooding and secretive.  Zelah Clarke is also perfect in her role as Jane.  Wonderfully romantic, this is a must buy!!
0060934719|5.0|The whole story consists of beautiful lyrical prose with Mr. Gaiman's drollness surfacing here and there, at many appropriate junctures. In Mr. Gaiman's world of untamed fantasies, even a falling star could be hysterically vicious and comical. The main character is a naïve, romantic, determined, and patient eighteen-year-old who journeys through a world very much different from his birthplace. There, in Faerie, anything is possible. During his adventure where he eventually matures, he is assisted by various creations especially luck yet sometimes he still succumbs to misfortunes that result in a suspenseful narration. Twists and turns that occur throughout the tale are straightened out in a marvelous manner at the end of the story and in the epilogue. It is a fairytale for adults who allow themselves to dream and be entertained by Mr. Gaiman's style of writing and sense of humor.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|Simply put this album kicks major ass.  I'm glad to see Kreator heading back in the right direction with their last two discs (Violent Revolution and this one).  The lyrics are awesome.  Very dark and sinister.  I blast this cd at work and sing along/ play air guitar.  There is not one bad song on here at all.  Never mind the guy complaining about there being more than 10 songs, it's nice to see a metal cd nowadays that isn't less than 40 minutes in length.  If I had to pick my favorite songs they would be \\"Dystopia\\", \\"Suicide Terrorist\\", Voices of the Dead\\", \\"Enemy of God\\", and \\"Dying Race Apocalypse\\".  Voices of the dead has the best solo IMO.  I really like the chorus to Dystopia though....  \\"All hail dystopia!  Your parasite messiah never comes!  All hail dystopia!  God has died when war drags ever on!\\"
B00082IJ08|4.0|I really liked the first Gorillaz CD, though there were several tracks that didn't catch me up.  When I heard DARE and Feel Good, Inc., on the radio, I instantly pegged them as Gorillaz songs and checked to see if there was  a new CD out.  When I listened to the samples, I realized this was going to be a favorite of mine.  Again, a few tracks don't appeal to me, but I'm really glad I bought this.  Kids With Guns, DARE, Every Planet We Reach is Dead, Demon Days, Last Living Souls, and inexplicably, Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head are fantastic (I say inexplicably to the last because it's just warped).  The other tracks aren't my style, but aren't bad.  I'm finding myself listening to several of the ones I like over and over, a sure sign I'm hooked on a CD.  Great job, and good videos if you've seen them.  It really is like some freakshow techno-hiphop dance party--just my style.
B00005JMAH|5.0|In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry, Ron and Hermione, now teenagers, return for their third year at Hogwarts, where they are forced to face escaped prisoner, Sirius Black, who poses a great threat to Harry. Harry and his friends spend their third year learning how to handle a half-horse half-eagle Hippogriff, repel shape-shifting Boggarts and master the art of Divination. They also visit the wizarding village of Hogsmeade and the Shrieking Shack, which is considered the most haunted building in Britain. In addition to these new experiences, Harry must overcome the threats of the soul-sucking Dementors, outsmart a dangerous werewolf and finally deal with the truth about Sirius Black and his relationship to Harry and his parents. With his best friends, reprised in their original roles, Harry masters advanced magic, crosses the barriers of time and changes the course of more than one life. Directed by Alfonso Cuaron and based on British author J.K. Rowling 's third book, this wondrous spellbinder soars with laughs, and the kind of breathless surprise only found in a Harry Potter adventure. Another well-made Harry Potter movie; my only complaint is that it ended.<br /><br />--Andy Olson
B000BKVQTS|1.0|Whoever came up with this movie has one really messed up mind.  I really did not care for it at all.
B000267JQK|5.0|... but Seether's remake of their debut CD Disclaimer is sure to draw a crowd anywhere it is played.  The original twelve songs from Disclaimer #1 are here, with the addition of eight new tracks, like Broken (feat. Amy Lee) and Sold Me, both featured on the soundtrack for The Punisher; the non-duet version of Broken is also here.  Is the DVD worth the extra money, you might ask.  The answer is a resounding yes, with loads of footage and music videos galore.  Overall, I am so glad that Seether decided to remake Disclaimer - and that their remake turned out this well.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|For the most part, a lot of musicals on broadway that turn into full length films are no where near as good as the show on stage. In The case of RENT, I will make an exception because it is a good percentage of the original cast, the filming was done rather well, and the music was recorded again in the studio and sounds phenomenal! I love this DVD because not only is this my favorite musical, but because they did such an awesome job making the transfer from stage to film. And I was absolutely thrilled after I saw it. It was so good in theatres that I saw it 4 times. Now that I have the DVD (I got it early from a friend of a friend) I have a reason to sit at home and be lazy! I can watch RENT on DVD now!!! On a scale of 1 to 10 on quality and overall impression of this DVD, I give it a 12! Buy this DVD!!!!! Hope this helped!
0684824906|5.0|I always enjoy hearing Kearns Goodwin speak, but I have often found her writing disorganized.  This book is the exception.  I was very happy to find a focused, disciplined text, chock-full of fascinating detail.  Kearns Goodwin resists her penchant to go off on tangents and captures the humanity of her subjects beautifully.  \\"Team of Rivals\\" should find a wide and enduring audience, not only among history buffs but also students of management and anyone who likes to read.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|This film joins other biopics such as Coalminer's Daughter and Ray in it's endearing and truthful account of the life of country music icon Johnny Cash. The film is engaging and manages to sweep even those who are unfamiliar with Mr. Cash into the roller coaster of events that comprised his often troubling, but ultimately fulfilling life. This film is most definitely a must-see for all audiences and for those who remember and cherish the legacy Johnny Cash left behind after his death, a must-own.
B0009S4IHY|2.0|I was disappointed with this film. It grew laborious to watch about 1 1/2 hours in. I started using the fast-forward button as I got to the end.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Everything about this series is brilliant. The camera-work is superb, it lacks some of the computer-animated flashiness of Babylon 5 but also absent is the latter's visual phoniness. The laws of physics are for the most part obeyed. The setting is no Trekish utopia, but rather a real, believable world inhabited by a mishmash of cultures and peopled by a realistic mix of saints, sinners, criminals, tyrants and heros.<br /><br />The dialogue was hands-down the best-written of any television show I have ever seen. It was witty and heartfelt. Mandarin exclamations and curse-words add to the realism of the multicivilizational melting-pot of the series while detracting nothing from the viewer's enjoyment.<br /><br />The acting was excellent; all the characters pulled their respective weight but none more brilliantly than Nathan Fillion, who played the sometimes-tortured, sometimes cheerful, sometimes-generous, sometimes-mercenary Captain Malcolm Reynolds with ablomb and great skill.<br /><br />Sadly, the powers that be at Fox killed this series in its prime. Even with the details revealed in the movie Serenity, we may never learn why the Alliance held Book in such high regard, how the civilization depicted in the series developed, what ultimately happened to the Reavers, Niska, or the duo of Kaylee and Simon. And we are denied future quotations from the works of Shan Yu. More's the pity.
B00005JL0I|5.0|Timeless and very entertaining for those who grew up on watching these kinds of movies.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This highly popular musical comes alive in the movie version, with the added dimension special effects provide.  The singing, especially by the lead female vocalist, is wonderful, and the music captivating.  No wonder this musical has set records for longevity in New York.   <br />   The phantom is well played, even if his voice does weaken occasionally.  However, his unrequited love tugs at the viewer's heart strings, and his plight gathers sympathy. <br />   This is a visual and musical treat, and a cinematic pleasure to view.  The last scene is particularly touching and evocative of a romance that is unending.
B00005V9IL|5.0|the abyss is a great sci-fi movie that was hurt by not having a very good ending when first shown. this new edition makes up for that and turns the mivie into a classic that i love to watch over and over again. the story of underwater oilrig men being used to help find a sub that sank near them is action packed and never slows down once it starts. you'll love it
B00005JOQ9|1.0|ok, i am from slovakia, and slovakia is beautiful country with very nice friendly people, and crime rate within the lowest in EUROPE. This movie,,,not only the story is very poor, but the whole nonsence imagage of a foreign country, that is just unbelivable! i cant believe someone would be able to come up with such a nonsence....i do feel very sad about my country being presented to americans ( who dont really know that much about central european countries to begin with, i am sorry...)in such a degrading way...i hope people wont waist their money on this movie...
B000002TQV|5.0|this is radiohead's best album in my opinion. one of the best things about it is the variety it offers. you get exhilirating upbeat tracks such as 'just' and 'my iron lung'. as well as the majestic classics, 'fake plastic trees' and 'high and dry'. there just isn't a bad song to be found here. you must have this album!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I could sing the praises of RENT forever. It has been my favorite show for years, and it has gotten to the point that whenever I say I'm going to New York, my friends roll their eyes and ask how many times I'll see RENT -this- time. <br /> <br />This is the movie version. I say that because people need to remember that this is not a DVD of a stage production. While I admit to lamenting the fact that some of my favorite songs (\\"Christmas Bells,\\" especially) are nowhere in this script, it does in fact work. It still celebrates the spirit and the joy that Jon Larson's work has inspired in all of us RENTheads for a decade now. <br /> <br />There are parts that seem bizarre and are not from the stage version (Maureen [Menzel] and Joanne's [Thoms] engagement party), and there are things that are amazing that also aren't in the stage version (spoken dialogue, bantering and witty, is much more prevalent). The songs are performed beautifully; the fact that six of the eight principle actors are from the original Broadway cast certainly helps immediately bring the feeling of the original show, and Tracie Thoms especially is a radiant addition to them. Adam Pascal (Roger) has said that the recording of the songs this time around is what it should have been originally, and they are indeed often more hard, more pressing, with the urgency that is such a key undertone to the show. <br /> <br />There are some problems. Some of the shots are ridiculous, such as when we find ourselves looking up at Angel [Heredia] dancing on the table in \\"Today 4 U\\" in a completely unflattering, bizarre shot, not to mention the under-arm shots of Maureen and Joanne during \\"Take Me Or Leave Me.\\" Benny's [Diggs] and Mark's [Rapp] characters are both reduced, as key elements of each of their characters are taken away. Luckily, the deleted scenes are included on a bonus disc, and these establish and fill out the aspects of their characters that are missing. <br /> <br />Though there are a few problems, the fact of the matter remains that RENT will always be superb. A little trimming of some songs and a few personality traits are not going to dampen the spirit of such a great piece of theatre -- and now cinema -- history. \\"La Vie Boheme\\" is amazing, and all of the actors -- ALL of the actors -- put their all into this movie. The overwhelming sense of love and respect comes through their acting and makes it a true pleasure to watch. <br /> <br />The special features on the DVD are great too -- the documentary on Jonathan Larson is fantastic and tragic (as his story should be), and the deleted scenes are well worth watching for any RENThead. I especially enjoyed the alternate ending, which immediately took me back to the stage version and had me crying after just that one scene. <br /> <br />The stage version, of course, is still better. RENT was written for the stage, and it does its job beautifully there. But Chris Columbus has done a great job of keeping the spirit, and this is a great DVD to have to tide you over for all of those months when you find yourself in Ohio and nowhere near Broadway. <br /> <br />Ahh, RENT. The show that has always made us appreciate life and love has once again, through this movie, reinforced its central theme: No day but today.
0380018179|5.0|The best part of reading this book is that it is divided by generation & by character. And each character is unforgetable. Undoubtedly, Mrs Colleen McCoullough is a magnificient writer. Meg, the central character, is someone many women would relate to and her character has evolved masterfully. A story of an amazing set of individuals who are bound together with a common thread-LOVE. <br /> <br />Most of all, it gives a perfect picture of Australian outback life, its cruel 'down sides' & beautiful & serene 'upsides'. <br /> <br />Read this book and immerse yourself into the life of these wonderful family. <br />
B000E1155E|5.0|By now you have heard about the Sheffield, Britain Arctic Monkeys unless you have been living under a rock. They had the quickest selling debut CD in the U.K. They are storming the world right now and are the next big thing. How did this all start? They played amazing live shows and the crowd felt a strong presence and they created a small fan base. Quietly the band spread throughout the U.K. through word of mouth. Next they handed out demo's and hosted songs on myspace. Next thing you know, they are being hyped as the next Beatles!!! (Fame wise, not musically!)    First they started out with a catchy single \\"I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor\\" to get they're name out and just show that they can plain rock out. Next they release \\"When The Sun Comes Down\\" to show they can play a different type of song. That quickly hit #1 in the U.K. charts and soon enough everyone in the world practically heard about Alex Turner's Arctic Monkeys. 2 band members are only 19 years old (Matt Helders, Andy Nicholson) only lead singer and guitars Alex Turner (band leader and writer), and guitarist Jamie Cook is 20.     This CD is one of the greatest albums that I have heard in a long time. Now, may in be something totally unique and experimental like the Flaming Lips? No, but it does what it wants to. Just plain rock out and create songs that people can just enjoy and dance to. There are tons and tons of potential hits in the US such as I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor, Fake Tales Of San Fransico, Still Take You Home, Mardy Bum, Perhaps Vampires Is A Bit Strong, When The Sun Goes Down....etc.  The best songs on the album, or the strongest IMO are The View From The Afternoon, and A Certain Romance. They are just the strongest lyrically and strongest structured.     The Arctic Monkeys just won best British Breakthrough Act at the Brits Awards. There is no weak song on the album, you may even find that the songs that aren't getting much play may end up being a personal favorite to you. Ignore the hype for 40 minutes and just decide for yourself and enjoy the biggest new band in the world. Believe the hype, the Arctic Monkeys are fianlly here.
0893860220|5.0|Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj's philosophy is the purest form of advaita vedanta (advaita = non-dualistic, vedanta = one of the six main branches of Indian spiritual philosophy) I've ever encountered. When SNM speaks, he speaks only simple, uncorrupted truth, and he speaks from personal experience.  It is simple, profound and experiential, devoid of complex intellectual theory.   <br /> <br />The topic is the nature of the self.  The title is a little misleading.  SNM never says, \\"I am That\\".  He even states that to say, \\"I am That\\" objectifies \\"That\\", which is incorrect.  He only says, \\"I am\\".  Which probably sounds hopelessly vague to most people.  But if you meditate, or have had similar spiritual experiences, you'll be able to relate to this book on an experiential level.   <br /> <br />If I was going to be shipwrecked on a desert island the rest of my life and could only take one book, this would be it.  I kept it on my nightstand for two years, and read it several times.  I wasn't able to read more than a couple of pages per night, as it was so profound that I needed time to digest.
0876855575|3.0|If you are hung-up on honest, gritty, down and dirty literature, then Mr. Bukowski is your author. While reading this, I could almost smell the liquor on his breath. This particular novel and writer came highly recommended to me, and I recall reading most of this at a high school football game one Friday night last September (Football bores me). While everyone was screaming and yelling for the home team to win, I was sitting there transfixed by Bukowski's compelling narrative of his rotten childhood, and laughing hysterically at times. Suffice it to say, reading Bukowski is like eating supper in a public restroom. Definitely not for everyone.

B00005JO9J|4.0|Yes, after such a long wait the DVD of Grey's Anatomy finally arrived in my neighborhood video store. I was eager to see it for the simple reason that I am a devoted fan of Canadian Diva Sandra Oh whom I have followed since Double Happiness. She's right, she can never get any good roles in Hollywood films since she relocated, and doing a series like Grey's Anatomy is the best job she's gotten. Even though the top billing of this series went to Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey, it was Oh who delivered the most memorable performance that's so worthy of her Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards. Well, so far I have only seen five episodes, so my review is more of an introductory. There's romance, educational moments, comedy, and tender moments in it's first five episodes. The gay patient teasing George was funny. The sneeky makeout sessions in the elevator between Meredith and Derek was thrilling and romantic. The \\"Dr.Supermodel/Addison\\" rescuing the illegal immigrant patient was a heartfelt experience. Then I was moved to tears when Cristina(Sandra Oh) couldn't save the live of the old black nurse. All I can say is that I am a film buff, and I was rather amazed that I enjoyed this series so much, and I definitly want to rent the rest of the first season.
038572179X|5.0|Once it gets going (give it 80 pages or so) McEwan's narrative blasts you like a geyser to the denoument.  I closed the cover feeling like I'd just had a traumatic event in my life.  I highly recommend it to anybody who loves being swept completely into a story.
B0000648WZ|4.0|Robert Heinlein didn't intend for his book to be the basis for a spoof of fascism's goofy self-image. That's what makes it work so well.
1573223026|3.0|Like many others here, I am a fan of \\"High Fidelity\\" and \\"About A Boy.\\" I hold Nick Hornby in high regard. I tend to think of him as the British Tom Perrotta (though if you are British you might think vice-versa.) Right now, I think Tom is pulling ahead. (Okay, it's not a race.)    Those last couple sentences demonstrate some of the problem with Hornby's shtick. Once you fall into a glib, multiple-asides approach, it's hard to break out. There are plenty of funny one-liners and observations in the novel, but after a while, the style wears thin.    Hornby has also chosen a difficult angle: He's taken four unlikeable characters, made each of them a protagonist, and given us a first-person view for each. This would be tough under any circumstance, but when it's about four potential suicides, well, where can you really go?    I think this could have worked better with some disciplined editing. I actually liked most of it. But the humor starts to get old, and the self-revelations and philosophy are worked over too much. To Hornby's credit, there's no Hollywood ending. Unfortunately, there's also no compelling reason to read to the end.    If you are new to Hornby and enjoy dark humor, this is a good bet. If you are an old fan, go with the paperback.    P.S. If they make a movie, here are some Beatles songs for the soundtrack: Eleanor Rigby, Nowhere Man, Helter Skelter, Tomorrow Never Knows. That would be Maureen, Martin, Jess, and JJ. ;-) Rock on, Nick.    P.P.S. (I've discovered this new thing: I can add onto reviews after I've received votes. This is interesting. We can all vote without saying why. I've done the same myself. But I'd be curious to find out why people had voted for or against me. Was it the review itself or simply the rating?  And what was it I said that made you vote the way you did?)
1400031087|3.0|I found the book very interesting and his writing style made me feel as though I was going though what he was going through.  I don't care that much that he exagerated some minor points.  However, I did find it a bit repetative.  Day after day at the clinic... I know that is how it really was, but for the book I think it could have been abreviated.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I have just finished watching Serenity, and am having difficulty remembering a better sci-fi movie. Witty dialog, likeable characters, great plot, excellent effects, and a story to wrap it all together. <br /> <br />I would recommend having seen at least a few episodes of Firefly in order to better grasp the nature of the threats facing the crew of the Serenity and the importance of their discovery.
B000BJS4BM|1.0|In spite of respectable Amazon service, completely sealed disk was found to be scratched and unreadable. That happened after I presented it to my friend, during my trip to Europe. Unfortunately, it doesn't make any sense to re-do the present - shipping to Europe is more expensive then the disk. But it is pity to understand that even LISENCED brand new sealed disks do not have a proof of quality as it used to be from Amazon. :(

0684824906|4.0|The best review I can give Goodwin's treatise on Lincoln and his cabinet is that I got the book from the library, and midway through I bought it.  (Yes, from Amazon.)  Goodwin's prose is not as captivating as Ron Powers' Mark Twain bio, but it's fluid and easy to read.  There is no need to constantly re-read passages to obtain the point, a style I wish many academics would copy.  Goodwin reveals Lincoln's relationships with his diverse cabinet and demonstrates the man's genius at getting the most out of subordinates while maintaining their respect.  I gave her four rather than five stars because of her penchant for throwing in interesting facts that were not necessarily relevant.  Still, these incidents are not plentiful enough to be obtrusive.  Recommended for everyone.
B000B63IEI|5.0|What a wonderful addition to the catalogue of Rachmaninov concertos!  Leif Ove Andsnes has carefully considered the score and Rachmaninov's own recordings, and he manages to give a fresh and intimate reading of this much-celebrated music without overdoing every nuance and stretching every phrase.  So many performances of these pieces want to tell you exactly how you should feel about this music; the emotions are often forced onto you.  Here, though, the romance is more subtle and is found in beauty of natural phrasing, careful balance, and what I can only describe as personal storytelling.  This performance would go well with the story of Romeo and Juliet-there is a youth and innocence, as well as passion and yearning.  I am reminded that Rachmaninov composed this concerto when he was young.    Andsnes's technique is flawless, and he plays with a rare clarity that allows you to hear every single note.  Each note is there for a purpose, and he has discovered how they each fit with one another in the larger picture (e.g., Track 4, 2:34).  He also knows when and how to accompany the orchestra.  Together, he and the Berlin Philharmonic, with its lush strings and gorgeous wind playing, make a wonderful partnership.  The orchestra, under Antonio Pappano, is stunning and always engaged.  The EMI engineering team gets credit for capturing all of the orchestra's many colors and subtleties.  Unfortunately, it also captures some of the conductor's excessive breathing, but I think this is a very small price to pay for this stunning performance.  The second concerto was recorded live, and the audience noise is minimal and unobtrusive throughout.    Overall, I have found this disc to be a great investment.  Upon first hearing of this recording, you will discover parts in both the piano and orchestra that you had never heard before (e.g., listen to the string pizzicati that is usually covered up at Track 5, 2:01).  Add that to the refreshing way Andsnes keeps the tempos flowing and manages to never lose a phrase with subtle rubato, and you have a reason to buy this recording even if you already own several.  Highly recommended.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This makes two wonderful CDs I would never have found if it wasn't for Amazon putting up a top seller list. I have not heard any of these on the radio nor have I seen the CD in stores. Why are these great CDs a secret?<br /><br />Sparkling wine...
B00000DQWT|3.0|As much as I love the Metheney Group, there is nothing here that hasn't been done much better in many other albums.  There are more abstract sections which move into the realm of the avant-guarde; presumably these correspond to events in the movie.  There is a song done by David Bowie with Metheney accompaniment, but it is dull and lifeless.   <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong - a Metheny / Mays composition will always be a joy to hear, and this is no exception.  And possibly a knowledge of the movie would make the music more meaningful (I have not seen the movie).  However, these compositions are small, contained, with no solos (!), and leave me cold.
0425129616|4.0|This is both the first novel for Agatha Christie and Hercule Poirot.  As such, it is an excellent place to start for Christie's fiction.  She was only 26 when she wrote it, but it certainly does not read like the work of an amateur.   <br /> <br />One of the pleasures of reading Christie's fiction is that it is like a time machine for traveling back to the upper class of England between the World Wars.  Not that society was ever REALLY like this, but it is how that society saw itself.  In the usual Christie fashion, a rich person is murdered in a small town.  Hastings, the narrator, involves the retired Belgian detective, Hercules Poirot to help solve the case.  As usual, everyone involved thinks that Poirot is an idiot, until he brings the noose around the murderer's neck. <br /> <br />While this book may not qualify as \\"literary fiction,\\" it is an involving read.  Mysteries are all about plots - not characters.  In fact, if one knows too much about the characters, it may spoil the mystery.  In this book, we witness the birth of a master plotter. <br />

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Simply stated, the best cast recording I've ever heard (and I've heard a lot), in addition to being some of the best songs I've ever heard.  The power of Idina Menzel's voice is incredible.  There cannot ever have been a show-stopper like the stunning \\"Defying Gravity\\" in the history of the theater.  \\"For Good,\\" the beautiful duet between Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth, is perhaps the most poignantly engaging ballad about friendship ever recorded.  Other bests on this cd are \\"Popular\\" (Chenoweth is hysterical to boot), \\"What Is This Feeling?\\", \\"The Wizard and I,\\" \\"I'm Not That Girl,\\" and the beautiful love song duet \\"As Long As You're Mine.\\"  Also notable is \\"No Good Deed,\\" the song during which Elphaba truly becomes \\"Wicked.\\"  Although I'm not a fan of most of the other tracks, this cd is a must-have for these eight tracks alone.  Highly recommended.
B000002JPA|5.0|In 1992, in the midst of the Seattle sound's dominance, Dream Theater put out an album that was nearly the antithesis of everything that was running around in the mainstream. Despite the fact that the winds were blowing in the opposite direction, this album brought them a measure of mainstream success that they would not ever duplicate. Upon listening to this album again, it's not hard to hear why. Images & Words, straight up and without reservation, is a really good album - diverse, musical, fluid, and exciting.  <br /> <br />The track that generally sticks in the head is the opener, Pull Me Under. Not surprisingly, this is the track that put Dream Theater on the radio, with its effective buildup, crushing riffs, and rock-solid hook. It also has a solid undercurrent of technical sophistication not only in the solos but in the construction of the whole thing. Unlike some later Dream Theater efforts, the band doesn't feel the need to hit you over the head with their skill. Another Day is a whole other beast, a slow and restrained ballad about death that is ultimately too saccharine to be completely successful, but is by no means bad. Take The Time is another highlight, much more proggish than the two previous tracks but still boasting an involving flow and carried by some more impressively technical guitar/key work. Surrounded is probably the weakest track on the album, but even here there's a U2-sounding section in the middle that brings it up.  <br /> <br />As we get into the second half, Dream Theater starts making more mission statements about their ability. Metropolis is probably the strongest example of this, as it winds through what is at heart a 9 1/2 minute instrumental stunt piece. It can be off-putting at times but it also retains an ability to dazzle and keep the listener guessing, something that later Dream Theater efforts fail to do. Under A Glass Moon features a magnificent guitar solo with a perfect blend of exotic melodicism, blazing fretwork, and weird buzzing noises. Wait For Sleep, a mellow duet between keyboardist Kevin Moore and vocalist James LaBrie, is a calm spot with a dark edge. The last track, Learning to Live, is a perfect summation of the album, as it winds its way through its 11 1/2 minute course in a way that both maintains its unity and shifts between moods and tempos effortlessly. <br /> <br />Images & Words winds up being a wonderful album - consistently compelling, always adventurous, and impressively iconoclastic. If Dream Theater had been able to put out six more of these, they'd be the unquestioned kings of the prog realm. As it is, they never did quite recapture the diversity and synthesis of influences that this unique album represents. Go buy it if you don't have it. If you do, listen to it now. Highlight tracks: Pull Me Under, Take The Time, Learning To Live.
B00000G3PA|1.0|Having produced over 70 films, Jerry Bruckheimer has been affiliated with a very large share of cinematic trash (ex.: Bad Boys II, the rediculous Pearl Harbor, Kangaroo Jack, etc.), but one of his worst affiliations comes with this poor excuse for a film.  The acting is bad, the story is bad, the directing is bad (Michael Bay directs another awful picture), and everything else about it is bad. In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert said \\"The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense, and the human desire to be entertained. No matter what they're charging to get in, it's worth more to get out.\\"  There could not be more truth in a review (For more hysterical reviews, see I Hated, Hated, Hated this Movie by Roger Ebert).  There is absolutely no reason that this movie should have ever been made.  I do agree with some of the other Amazon reviewers in that Willis does his best with what he was given.  Certain actors can still be good and be in one of the worst movies of the year, so hats off to him.  For the rest of the poor souls that acted in this movie (Affleck, Tyler, Buscemi), I think you should fire your agents.  There is no room in this world for Michael Bay.  Jerry Bruckheimer has produced some good ones (Remember the Titans, Black Hawk Down) but he should have stayed away from this one.
0425200477|5.0|This is one of Christie's best stories.  Considering how many mysteries she wrote, her most successful ones are those which turn the conventions of mysteries on their ear.  Murder on the Orient Express did this, and so does Roger Ackroyd.  The thing is, DON'T READ ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK BEFOREHAND.  People are so up-in-arms over the secret, they keep giving it away. <br /> <br />Just read the book. <br />
6304698690|4.0|Just as good as the one I had remembered from childhood with Margaret O'Brien, in black and white.  Which I had adored and built all sorts of magical stories around.  This is a great one for children, and the color version only adds to that magic.  Holland is also the director of \\"Europa, Europa\\", another great film, but for adults.
B000000Y2F|4.0|I gave this four stars because although it is good in its own right, you would be better off spending your money on the Best Of Monk and, for Coltrane, getting Best of Coltrane.  But, if you want to only buy one, and this is your first foray into Jazz or Coltrane, get the Best of Miles Davis and John Coltrane album. <br /> <br />In short, this is for collectors only...
B000CNDIZE|4.0|I will probably regret not giving this cd 5 stars.  This is an intriguing cd.  \\"Rewrite\\" starts off, an incredibly engaging song, with a smoldering yet hopeful \\"happy chorus,\\" as one critic has described it.  It has a laughing through tears quality, you don't know if she's just met a new love, walking out on the old one, or if the song is about the creative process, with literal \\"rewrites,\\" and the lyrics are somewhat cryptic.  Other highlights are \\"The Bully,\\" \\"Moon,\\" \\"Sunday.\\"  I don't know who to compare her to; totally original, incorporeal, melodic Euro-pop (although she is from Australia), but fans of Tori Amos and Charlotte Martin should like.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Dream Theater's stock has been falling with me lately, mainly because I'm becoming more receptive to the criticisms of the band that are often bandied about. From a band that so often goes ridiculously over the top with blur-of-notes technical displays and odd-meter sections that often seem there just to establish that DT are intelligent prog rockers, Octavarium is a welcome display. These obviously well-educated musicians use their powers to craft music that could be compelling to a broader audience than the note-counting, BPM-calculating guitar majors that have increasingly been the band's main defenders. In other words, Octavarium is Dream Theater's most mellow album since Falling Into Infinity, and it is all the better for it. <br /> <br />The Root of All Evil is anoter chapter in the song cycle that started with The Glass Prison, but this time the tempo is distinctly slower, the groove more accented, the structure less convoluted. Unlike This Dying Soul on Train of Thought, DT does not feel the need to tack on an extra minute of musically meaningless flash at the end. The opening track becomes a sort of mission statement for the rest of the album, stating boldly that this album will not be a similar display of excess. This statement is firmed through The Answer Lies Within, a laid-back piano ballad, and is rock-solid by These Walls, which has a guitar fill in the midsection that seems like guitarist John Petrucci's invitation to cut loose a blazing run. Instead, the guitar weaves a simple and very effective melody, a mild-mannered move that after three albums of relentlessly rapid guitar work was more thrilling than any flashy solo. <br /> <br />The rest of the album continues on a similar note, with the first truly mind-boggling guitar work taking place in Never Enough. Even this demonstration works in the song and album, however, as DT realizes that holding your fire and then cutting loose at the right time is more effective than just cutting loose. The lasttwo songs suffer, however, from the problems that have bogged Dream Theater down as of late. Sacrificed Sons begins as a decent treatment of 9/11, especially with the melancholy vocal harmonies in the chorus, but inserts an aimless solo section that makes the song too long by half. As for the closing title track, its 24-minute run seems like the same kind of recitation of influences that hurt 6 Degrees and Train of Thought (a Pink Floyd section, a Metallica section, a Muse section, etc.) <br /> <br />Despite a late slowdown and some pretty bad lyrics (not that lyrics have ever been the reason to listen to this band), Octavarium is Dream Theater's best work since the mid-90s. Those looking for restraint will find it and those looking for flash can find that too. DT always seems to put out the album that I want to hear from them, and they've done it again on that score. Recommended. Highlights include The Answer Lies Within, These Walls, and Never Enough.

0060872675|4.0|I bought this for myself, but have to hide it from my 2 year old grandaughter.  In fact, I am going to order a second copy for her very own!  I love it for Pratchett's usual off-the-wall humour, but she loves it in it's own right as a story and really enjoys the illustrations.  I definitely think it is aimed at a much younger age level than any of his other children's books, but I would highly recommend it for either anyone with small children, or for the Pratchett fan - just don't expect the usual discworld depth & detail for this book.

0767802659|4.0|It seems like most people either love this movie, or hate it. Either way, it is a bad idea to compare it to the book, since it is so different. But movie rendition's are almost always different, so it's rediculous to whine about it. <br /> <br />If you like action, special effects, cool equipment, and ass- kicking, I reccomend it. Some of the reviewers on here didn't like the action at all... I don't know why- it is pretty exciting. As for military tactics, it is pretty unrealistic, but come on- it's Hollywood. Get over it. <br /> <br />As a political statement, it could go either way. I missed the concept completely until I saw the director's commentary. It is pretty interesting if you watch it with that in mind. <br /> <br />The best part of the movie is the view on leadership. It is interesting to see \\"Johnny Rico\\" progress from school kid to a jaded, somewhat bitter, veteran. He plays the part of the \\"Gung Ho\\" infantry leader very well. You can criticize his acting, but the role is made to be somewhat mechanical. The soundtrack is also brilliant, and underrated. <br /> <br />All in all, watch the movie with an open mind. You can't take it too seriously, or you are destined to hate it.
B00006IU73|5.0|In Absentia is a complete jewel of an album. It's a concept album where the concept is only implied, but that nonetheless holds itself together and is propelled forward by its bedrock material. It's a hooky piece of modern rock that is not obviously progressive, but that has layers upon layers of ambience and instrumentation that retain the ability to surprise after many listenings. It swerves from heaviness to delicacy with a deft touch and winds up being consistently powerful from track to track.  <br /> <br />Blackest Eyes is a hot opener. Porcupine Tree had never been as heavy as the first blasting riff of this one is, and the swing back toward shimmering chords and tight, crystalline harmonies is perfectly executed and effective. Trains is an emotional high point that also showcases the band's flexibility as they shift from a powerful chorus to a bluegrassy banjo/handclap breakdown with ease. Lips of Ashes is a spacy, dark piece of minimalism that continues the album's winning streak. After this, PT loses some steam as The Sound of Muzak wraps a typical prog-musician bellyache in some pretty intricate and emotive instrumental parts. Gravity Eyelids starts off as a weird piece of electro-rock, quotes Opeth toward the end, and glides to a calm conclusion. Wedding Nails is Porcupine Tree's last instrumental and it's not terribly hard to see why, as it fails to hold interest all the way through, despite a false stop and subsequent start that winds up being a cool surprise.  <br /> <br />After this, however, it's all uphill. Prodigal and .3 are fairly quiet, minimalistic homages to Porcupine Tree's past work that drive Steven Wilson's trademark sardonic lyrics to the forefront. The Creator Has A Mastertape is driven by an exciting, bobbing bass line that menaces and promises heavier things to come, as they do in the chorus. Next is the lush, devastating, perfect Heartattack In A Layby, which is one of the best-orchestrated pieces of rock music ever written. Strip The Soul has the rotten task of following that, but manages to do well enough with its varied riff work. Finally, the closing Collapse The Light Into Earth builds up its simple chord progression by adding more and more layers and winds up being another perfect example of how good a simple idea can be.  <br /> <br />There's no excuse for passing this up. If you like Radiohead, Coldplay, or Pink Floyd, you couldn't possibly miss with In Absentia. If you come from the other side of prog rock, with all its dramatic technical displays, you're still likely to find a satisfying listen here. Strongly recommended, because it's simply great. Highlight tracks: Trains, The Creator Has A Mastertape, Heartattack In A Layby, Collapse The Light Into Earth.
0895260131|1.0|This book is littered with these comparison quotes from Jesus and Muhammad.  The author picks and chooses what he considers to be 'equivalent' quotes from the Bible and the Koran where Muslims look violent and irrational and Christians look peaceful and loving.  The author provides no context for the reference, no scholarly interpretation, so it's clearly aimed at making Muslims look bad.  There is a quote from Jesus that has been conspicuously left out: \\"Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace on Earth.  I did not come to bring peace, but a sword\\" (Matthew 10:34).  I wonder why the author of this book chose to leave that quote out.  It's real easy to pick and choose verses out of books as big as the Koran and Bible and present an image of those religions as either peaceful or violent.  It's also completely deceptive and anyone who thinks this book is a presentation of the definitive truth on Muslims needs to stop drinking and Kool-Aid and might want to reads some books on the subject by scholarly writers.

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This film is worth watching for its beautiful picture more than for anything else. Each shot looks like it has been taken from a painting of a period. Congratulations to the director and cameraman. The acting was good, the casting was good too, with some minor exceptions.<br /><br />It was the interpretation of the story which made me cringe from time to time. Was it really necessary to insert quite a lot of the awkward modern dialogue and the ways of expression into the story to show that it's topical? The director could express himself and convey the social message of the story without distorting the ways and customs of the past and adapting the story to modern ways.<br /><br />For one, could you ever imagine a grand lady of the society bursting into somebody's house in the middle of the night even if the matter was urgent?? Is it really necessary to take such radical measures to emphasize the character's personality? Sometimes I thought there was too much explained and too vividly expressed what could have been left to understand.<br /><br />On the other hand, the story was not very well developed, concentrating on Lizzy alone and leaving behind some important characters. We do not fully comprehend the drama of Lydia's escape with a man as we do not see in the full the wickedness of Mr. Whickam. Concequently, untouched is the theme of the goodness and just appearance of it as well as some other important messages. The story was quckly flowing from scene to scene without allowing the spectator to be involved.<br /><br />Moreover, almost all of the book characters appeared in the film; some, for a second only, after disappearing forever. This only crowded the film and left the residue of unsatisfaction, for you expect the story line to develop somehow in connection with the newly introduced character. True, the director didn't have much time at his disposal, well then... I know some big volumes transferred into the film media without losing their impact. If the director wanted to introduce a new, different interpretation of the story, he succeded only in modernizing dialogue and changing visual style, but his message is quite weaker than the original.<br /><br />On the whole, it is a pleasant production and does deserve an apprisal (for its picture mostly). However, the impeccable version of the book has been already made - 1995 BBC miniseries, and... what's the point in remaking the perfect?!ed to introduce a new, different interpretation of the story, he succeded only in modernizing dialogue and changing visual style, but his message is quite weaker than the original. <br />On the whole, it is a pleasant production and does deserve an apprisal (for its picture mostly).

B00005UEAR|3.0|Dream Theater's sixth album is clearly on a mission. From the sprawling two-disc format (with the second disc supposedly containing just one 42-minute song) to the five-word title, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence promises to be even more technical, more progtacular, more everything than Dream Theater has ever been before. Trying to be bigger than their previous album, Scenes from a Memory, however, proved to be not only futile but counterproductive. Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is ultimately too indigestible, too incoherent, too faux-grandiose, and just plain too much to be successful. <br /> <br />However, on its way to the overblown hell that is the dark side of prog, Six Degrees delivers plenty of good things. The Glass Prison is a phenomenally successful opener, delivering nearly 14 minutes of varied, intense, and spectacular thrash metal. After that, the adrenaline level falls off a notch for Blind Faith, which is an OK track but doesn't really stick in the craw. Misunderstood is far better, with lyrics that actually stick out as good (a rarity for Dream Theater) and an excellent chorus buildup, but in the long freak-out that finishes the track it loses a lot of steam. The Great Debate was instantly irrelevant, being written and recorded before 9/11 but having the cruel fate to come out afterward. Stem cell research was so far off the radar by the time the song came out that it no longer seemed like a debate worth having. The song isn't any great shakes either, and if you try to make a political song it's generally better to make an up-or-down stand if you want to be interesting. The first disc finishes with Disappear, which is wonderful. It's atmospheric, emotionally devastating, and restrained in a way that nothing else on the album is.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, it turns out that the first disc is the only worthwhile material on here. The second disc not only drops the intensity of the first half into a bucket of cold water, but tries to ratchet up theprog-ness with devastating effect. You can hear the influences fly by - oh, there's Yes, and there's Metallica, and there's Maiden, and there's Pink Floyd, and there's...etc. This takes a serious bite out of the disc, as does the generic mental illness theme. Goodnight Kiss, with its great outro solo, is probably the only major bright spot on the second disc. Other than that, Dream Theater reaches farther than they're capable of going, or even probably farther than rock music can go without taking a trip to the cheese factory. <br /> <br />In sum, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is to music as a Michael Bay movie is to film. If Dream Theater had just released the first disc, this album would probably have a better rep. While it's admirable that they have the courage to try stuff this big, they're not quite the right guys for the job - not that anyone is (except maybe Opeth). You can buy this one or not, keeping in mind that it's got some severe flaws.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This movie has so many different aspects to it.  I find that it tells the story of Human love and the fact when that love is forbidden how it affects not only the people in love but all those around them.  It is a terrible thing that people cannot truly express their love for the person they want to and a true tragedy.  This movie is important to see by as many people as possible because I think it moves you to a place deep within your emotions that people need to fill.  The charecters are so inspiring to make you want to do more to better not only yourself and the world around you, but it also has a deeper meaning one I'm still working on exploring.  All I know is that this is the first movie in all of my lifetime of 41 years that has inspired me to a point that I feel paralyzed by emotions.  Never has any movie, book, play, or painting brought so much out of me.  I just want everyone to experience this movie one time.  Joe

B0001NBMBC|1.0|And in time we have seen this group fall by the wayside with fans and the general public, because they are not good musicians or songwriters.  throw a bunch of people from juvenile hall into a basement and give them some drums, guitars, and halloween costumes and you will come up with a better, longer lasting shock rock of discomfort than what these guys can deliver to you.  The subliminal verses is really an attempt at just making money.  There is no vision, no direction for the songs to go.  The subject matter covered in the songwriting is ripe with cliche's and even then they still don't hold a tune.  They really could have been something great but this release proves that they really aren't worthy of anything more than wanna-be wishful underground metal.
B000AADYYO|5.0|You two should shut up about what you think is metal...First off you're little kids.  You shouldn't be listening to metal.  Second AS I LAY DYING is sell out metal and not heavy at all. The singers a pansy and the music is genric.  Those guys don't hold a candle to Opeth, and don't get me started on Chimera.  If need be stick to your sell-out american metal, and I'll take the swedish rock that knows what it's all about.   <br /> <br />Now, on to the review.  Opeth's newest entry into the metal market is amazing.  A brutal start of the cd drags the listener in before a rollercoaster effect takes place throughout the album up until the last note.  Opeth are an amazing band, as I've stated earlier, and are up in the ranks of In Flames, Soilwork, Children of Bodom, and Cradle of Filth.  If you're feeling like trying something a little more \\"differen't check out Blind Guardian, Gate, and Tyr.

One of the service staff at the restaurant saw the book I was reading and randomly struck up a conversation - he recommended that I read the Alchemist.  Shortly after, I ordered it and I was able to read it in just a couple of days.  It was inspiring and intriguing - like being a child and listening to a story teller, except that the lessons were directed at someone who has had maybe 30 to 40 years of life experiences.  A beautiful mind-expanding tale!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|This is a must see for those who enjoy a good love story.  The obstacles we overcome is what makes a love story great and \\"Walk The Line\\" does just that.  Reese Witherspoon was wonderful as always but Phoenix may very well have taken the lead from Reese.  I have never seen a Reese Witherspoon movie when any other actor could come close to her, but Phoenix did.  Reese and Phoenix found a hidden music talent.  I immediately went out and bought a 2 disc set of Johnny Cash's greatest hits and I will purchase the Soundtrack. June Cash was a heck of a woman. June was in love with Johnny for years and only when he overcame his addiction did she admit her love for him.  He was worth the wait.  I think June Carter's mother knew she loved Johnny before she ever admitted it to herself.
B000002H2Z|5.0|There isn't much point in me reiterating what just about every other review here says.  Into the late '80s, I'd heard and owned every Cure album at one point or another.  Today, I own one and only one Cure album, and this is it.  I even went out of my way to grab a copy on vinyl. <br /> <br />There is a presence on this album that transcends what the Cure were.  It simply nails a particular sound that drives on all cylinders and yet manages to keep from sounding stale by the end of the disc.  I'm still sad when it's over. <br /> <br />Oddly enough, I saw a video for Inbetween Days on Fuse last night.  Twenty-plus years after the album comes out and I see a video for the first time.  Very strange.  Needless to say, I had to stop what I was doing, sit down, and watch every second of it. <br /> <br />I will continue to listen to this album until I die, I'm sure.  I must recommend this album to everybody.  It's a classic.  Go get it.  You will not be sorry.
0316776963|5.0|I remember first seeing the book Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris resting on a coffee table in my old residence at the Tung Fa Noodle Factory in Brooklyn.  If I remember correctly, my roommate Felicia was reading it and suggested I do the same.  This was in 2001; five years later I finally read it.  As the saying goes, better late then never.   <br /> <br />Me Talk Pretty One Day was one of the few books that have made me laugh out loud.  Whether taking guitar lessons with a midget, creating performance art while high on drugs, or coping with his odd family life, the main character's reflections on his childhood in North Carolina are brilliantly written and visually captivating.  As the character floats through life without much ambition or self-direction, the reader is often left wondering what weird situation he is going to stumble upon next.        <br /> <br />In the second half of the book, the character and his boyfriend move to France where his struggle to identify with being American turns out to be as difficult a challenge in a foreign land as back in his own country.  Sedaris' talents as a writer shine as he cleverly demonstrates the absurdity of a language lost in translation.  His word play, best exemplified in a chapter in which the main character is taking French lessons, adds poetry to humor.     <br /> <br />I think the unique craft of the book stems from Sedaris' witty use of language in combination with his ability to take a familiar experience and turn it into something extraordinary.  Like Sedaris, when growing up in the suburbs, I would go to the shopping mall to take guitar lessons from some slightly \\"outlandish\\" music teacher.  While I could have tried to write about my experiences taking guitar lessons, it takes someone like Sedaris to able to observe, remember, and articulate life's little absurdities into one tale.  Although in his childhood Sedaris might not have dreamed of talking pretty, this book certainly does that and much more.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I was so pleased to learn that Stevie Nicks was, indeed, releasing another solo album.  I have ALL of her solo albums as well as The Enchanted Works of Stevie Nicks, I consider myself a staunch supporter of her musical efforts.<br /><br />It hurts me to read the other reviews, reviews that state that this album is not one of her best.  They ridicule because of her more mature voice, and her inability to scream the high notes of her late twenties.  What they must realize is that after years of drugs, cigarettes and booze, her voice has suffered; not to mention the fact that she was almost 53 when she made this album.  As a person matures their voice changes, it still as beautiful today as it was in the 70's.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but I don't think they are taking her life and tribulations into consideration, open your mind up more and listen closely.<br /><br />The title track on this album is fabulous, still the poetic lyrics that she is known for and the music ROCKS!<br /><br />\\"Sorcerer\\", \\"Planets of the Universe\\", and \\"Love Is\\" are the kind of songs that we have come to expect from Stevie, beautiful, poetic and powerful.<br /><br />\\"Love Changes\\" and \\"I Miss You\\" are reminiscent of her days with Fleetwood Mac, days when she was letting her fears and changes come through in her music.  When she wanted someone to know exactly how she was feeling about them.<br /><br />All in all I would have to say that I was thrilled to pieces with most of the album.  But to be honest I was also just tickled pink that she was releasing another album that I could stand behind and proudly add to my collection.<br /><br />I love it and I think that if you love her and her music then you will love it also.<br /><br />Tootles

B000E5KJI4|4.0|As a teacher of Classical Greek and Roman Mythology I was really looking forward to \\"Troy.\\" In the past I have put together a unit on the Trojan War that included not only Homer's epic poem the \\"Iliad,\\" but also the plays of Euripides and Aeschylus and other ancient works on the stories of these characters. In other words I am familiar with this story to the extent that when Briseis showed up wearing a garment with long sleeves I was upset that we did not get to see the lovely arms that were part of her usual epithet. So, suffice it to say, that when characters who survived the Trojan War started dying in this film, I was not exactly happy. Consequently, the truth is that the less you know about the Trojan War of classical mythology, the more you will enjoy Wolfgang Petersen's \\"Troy.\\"<br /><br />I have no problem with the idea that Homer and the other ancients have to be adapted in making a modern motion picture about the Trojan War. The decision to eliminate the gods is appropriate, getting away from the idea that this was a ten year war certainly makes sense, and if the alliance of the Greeks is now political rather than as part of an oath sworn by the princes who were suitors for Helen's hand, I consider that tlegitimate. I do not understand why Iphigenia, Cassandra, and Hecuba are all eliminated but they are not fatal omissions. But when you start rewriting who gets killed that is going a bit too far, especially when one premature death starts a chain effect that means Athens will never develop the jury system, which means we probably lose out on it too. David Benioff's screenplay was \\"inspired\\" by Homer's \\"Iliad,\\" which at least is an honest way to characterize what he did in this script, but I still do not have to like it or endorse it.<br /><br />The big selling point for this film was not Homer but rather Brad Pitt as Achilles. Stories abound about how Pitt worked six months to get in shape for this film, gave up smoking, and ended up hurting his Achilles tendon in one of those profound ironies that indicates that maybe the gods were not pleased with what was happening in this film. Pitt certainly looks good, not just in terms of taking several opportunities to display the line of his nude body, but in how he carries himself as Achilles. The whole idea is that this guy is the greatest warrior on the face of the planet and Pitt exudes that with the way he strides across the sands of Troy. Even more impressive is the choreography for the fights, because Pitt's movements are so smooth and powerful, especially compared with that of Eric Bana's Hector, that you do not doubt that this guy is in a league by himself as a warrior. I also like the way he uses the distinctive form of his shield when fighting. They thought this part out quite a bit.<br /><br />The fight choreography was worked out by Simon Crane, the film's stunt coordinator and second unit director, who describes Achilles as fighting with a boxing style but with the velocity of a speed skater and the agility of a panther. They also come up with a nice touch in that Achilles looks slightly to the side at his opponent until he is ready to come in for the kill. The best fight sequences of \\"Troy\\" are when Achilles is fighting. The giant battle sequences of computerized soldiers are not as impressive, mainly because the camera is always in motion and the cutting is so fast that we are left with an impression of the battle rather than always being able to tell what is going on (which has become my constant complaint with most movies with large battle sequences).<br /><br />Bana does a good job of capturing Hector's nobility without turning him into a marble statue, while Peter O'Toole fills the role of Priam naturally. On the Trojan side the problematic character is Paris (Orlando Bloom), again because of the writing more than the performance. Priam has negotiated peace between Troy and the Sparta of King Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), but that is destroyed when Paris persuades Helen (Diane Kruger) to run away with him. Both Hector and Priam know that Paris is wrong and their reasons for supporting him and thereby dooming Troy ring hollow (the less than stellar \\"Helen of Troy\\" television miniseries did a nice job of providing a solid motivation for the Trojans to protect Helen).<br /><br />It you want to draw a clear distinction between Homer's story of Achilles and that of Benioff it is that the former is about the rage of Achilles (see the first line of the \\"Iliad\\") and the latter adds an equally strong love element. The one character whose role is most inflated in this version is that of Briseis (Rose Byrne), the Trojan slave girl who comes between Achilles and Agamemnon (Brian Cox), the king of kings for the Greeks. This change becomes the reasoning behind how the film rewrites the end game of the Trojan War, although I still do not understand why some of the key characters get to live happily ever after. But since Pitt's performance dominates the film and he is clearly the horse that director Wolfgang Petersen is riding to make the whole thing work, it makes sense that he has to be around until the very end.<br /><br />Each semester about a third of my students take the option to compare \\"Troy\\" to what they know about Homer's \\"Iliad\\" and the mythology of the Trojan War.  Most of them take exception to the changes as well, which I find interesting because most of them saw the movie before they got around to reading \\"what really happened.\\"  I have expanded their options to include the recent \\"Helen of Troy\\" mini-series, but \\"Troy\\" is still their favorite target.en Paris persuades Helen (Diane Kruger) to run away with him.

B000E6ESL2|4.0|This film was very much misadvertised. I remember seeing the trailer once or twice, but it was very close to the release date of the movie, so who knows how many people didn't get to see it. I didn't really see it advertised on tv or hear about the actors doing tv spots, etc to promote the film. Who knows what happened there, but due to that, this film flopped. <br /> <br />Not everyone will like it, but I certainly found it to be a great film. I figured out what was really going on eventually while watching this movie, but for a while, my friends and I couldn't figure it out. - which is why I found it to be a smart film.  <br /> <br />The acting in the movie is almost perfect. I didn't find anything wrong with the acting and I am usually bothered easily by bad acting. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing about the movie is probably the use of Ewan McGregor's character wearing the shorter pants. I found that humorous once I figured out what it was about. <br /> <br />To conclude, this very underrated film is worth a look if you have the time and the money. It's definitely one of the better movies of this year.
0393327655|5.0|Today's Toledo Blade had stories about an islamic \\"cleric\\" offering a $1,000,000 reward for the DEATH of the Danish cartoonist who represented the \\"prophet\\" in blasphemous cartoons, and one about a Texas \\"christian\\" woman who cut off her baby's arms because she thought a nature show of television was a sign of the apocalypse.  Sam Harris's The End of Faith expresses what many of us have known since childhood:  that religion is for liars and cowards.  I loved his meticulous demonstration from the koran's scores of passages urging/praising/rewarding murder, and I loved his equally lucid discussion of the murderous and probably psychotic consciousness responsible for the book of deuterotomy. <br /> <br />So many people are brainwashed from the moment they can understand language that we have a global population of emotional and intellectual cripples leaning for some kind of solace on absurd ravings of ancient lunatics. <br /> <br />If anybody wants to form a political party based on the ethics and politics inherent in Harris's work, I'll sign up.
020530902X|4.0|I just received the book, and on reviewing it liked the layout, the conciseness, and the usefulness of its content. It suits my purposes. For those reasons, I'm giving it 4 stars.<br /><br />However, a quick perusal made me suspect that I might need to consult another reference whenever questions arise. I know the book was written 50 years ago, and perhaps English grammar usage has changed - or perhaps the editors missed a spot. But I flipped through the book and came upon a ghastly (to me) error. If you look up usage for \\"get,\\" \\"got,\\" \\"have gotten,\\" the book states that \\"have got\\" is preferred, and displays \\"have gotten\\" as an error. Seeing it in a book about technical writing is cringe-inflicting.<br /><br />Excuse me, but there is no \\"have got\\" in proper English grammar. You either \\"have\\" or you \\"got\\"; not both at once. The correct form is \\"have gotten.\\" So I suppose we need to be on the lookout for archaic content that wasn't weeded out in later editions, or colloquial rules that don't apply in the US -- I know that's a habit the British HAVE GOT. I checked a British dictionary, and OFFICIALLY the usage is the same as in the US...but we use the correct form in America.<br /><br />On the other hand, Americans always place punctuation marks within quotations whether or not they logically belong there (the book got that right) because \\". and \\", caused problems with old printing presses. We never moved past that, while the Brits did, and their treatment of quotations makes more sense. So it all evens out. (Someone should write a book on comparative English grammar, in my opinion, just so we don't get confused after reading English literature, or listening to the BBC say, \\"The group were...\\" or \\"The family were...\\")<br /><br />So, I like the book, but that one flaw makes it just a little suspect to me. I'll always have a second reference nearby.
B00004VXX3|4.0|I was totally enthralled by the dazzling remake of J.M. Barrie's classic story of the boy who did not grow up that came out in 2003 from director P.J. Hogan, and there are some magical moments in 204's \\"Finding Nverland\\" when we finally get to opening night. So I thought maybe it was time to go back and reconsider Steven Spielberg's 1991 film \\"Hook.\\" In this version it turns out that Peter Pan did grow up. He fell in love with Wendy's granddaughter, Moira, decided to stay in our world, and does not remember anything that happened before the age of 12. With heavy-handed irony, Peter turns out to be a corporate raider (in other words, a pirate), who not only does not remember what it is like to be a child, he also ignores his own children. However, that all changes when Captain Hook makes his way to Granny Wendy's London home and kidnaps Peter's two children, Jack and Maggie. Tinkerbell shows up to help Peter remember who he is and take him to Never-Land to save the day.<br /><br />A lot of Spielberg's films deal with the theme of the absent father and clearly a key part of \\"Hook\\" is that Peter, the father, remembers not only his true self but his own children. But the film does not provide the sense of magic we expect from Spielberg and I want to make the argument that the problem is not so much the story as it is the casting. You simply cannot have Robin Williams in a movie like this and not expect him to be Robin Williams, which means that several key scenes get spun in a way that is not necessarily in the best interest of the story. Throw into the mix Dustin Hoffman having fun playing Captain Hook, Bob Hoskins having almost as much fun playing Smee, and Julia Roberts as a very talkative Tinkerbell, and you have a lot of star power running around on screen.<br /><br />The problem for me is what happens to Rufio, King of the Lost Boys, because that event changes the whole equation at play here. Because of what happens Peter cannot let Captain Hook off the hook, yet that is exactly what he does. I suppose it was too much for either Peter Pan or Robin Williams to do what had to be done in those circumstances, but this forces the film to come up with a way to have the right thing happen, albeit it in a comic way, without Peter having to get his hands dirty. Still I came back to what happened to Rufio and as the end game plays out in Never-Land I know in my heart that this is just not right.<br /><br />The idea that the casting of the principles is off is confirmed for me when we get back to London town. The reaction of Caroline Goodall's Moira when her children come back and Maggie Smith's performance from start to finish as Granny Wendy seem to me to be grounded in the film that this one should have been. If Dame Maggie had been the only recognizable name in this film and the others had been even relative unknowns, then the message in \\"Hook\\" might have worked. In other words, this needed to be a Steven Spielberg film and not a Robin Williams movie. There is a lot of power to be mined from Barrie's original story, which is exactly what Hogan proved in creating the best \\"Peter Pan\\" movie of them all.yet that is exactly what he does.

B000BT97AO|5.0|With Gaiman's impressive storytelling ability and McKean's dazzling eye for design, a movie wasn't completely unheard of - it makes sense that they would do this as McKean's artwork has always been very multimedia oriented, mixing photography with drawing and painting. He continues this approach with Mirrormask but also throws in CGI animation and music into the mix.<br /><br />As you would expect from a Gaiman/McKean production, it is very visual and rather non-linear in nature with a light façade but underneath lurks a darkness that is the hallmark of their collaborations. Every frame looks like a work of art, like one of McKean's paintings come to life. There is so much to look at (like a landscape filled with red, spiral staircases) and it is a densely visual film much like a waking dream. Even though, at times, you may not know what is going on exactly, you trust that Gaiman's storytelling abilities and McKean's visuals are going somewhere. This is a smart, visually stunning movie that fans of both these men's work will love but it is also accessible to those not familiar with their work.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Dave McKean and writer Neil Gaiman. This is a decent if not unremarkable track that is okay but missing that special something which comes as something of a surprise from such articulate, entertaining guys like Gaiman and McKean.<br /><br />\\"The Making of Mirrormask\\" is an eight-part making of documentary that can be viewed in its individual segments or altogether. Jim Henson's company was interested in following up films like The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth with another original fantasy film and felt that Gaiman and McKean were the perfect team to do it. The cast talk about what drew them to the project and their impressions of McKean. The highlight of this doc is Q&A sessions Gaiman and McKean did at the San Diego Comic Con and at a Sundance screening. They are charming and witty as they talk about how long it took to shoot the movie, what was its inspiration and so on.<br /><br />Finally, there is a \\"Poster and Cover Art\\" gallery that features various designs and concepts by McKean that is simply amazing to look at.shoot the movie, what was its inspiration and so on. <br /> <br />Finally, there is a \\"Poster and Cover Art\\" gallery that features various designs and concepts by McKean that is simply amazing to look at.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|At least the 1940 movie had a superb cast (Most notably L. Olivier as Mr. Darcy) while this version has nothing, absolutely nothing to justify it. Cut to bleeding chunks Austen's witty novel appears like a Rosamunde Pilcher novel set in Regency Times. Which brings me to my next point. Regency. People of that standing did not scamper around in sloppy and non-period clothes at the time, esp. not in England! Wrong hairstyles, utterly wrong and garish colours do not stand for \\"natural\\" but for lousy costumes & make-up and no understanding of the time-period. The most horrid faux pas was what both wore in the kitschy and trashy sunrise scene that subsituted the truly sweet and charming second proposal moment of the novel. They rewrote not only that but cut important things, added useless stuff & dialogue! And the acting? Keira Knightly, for all her looks, was just annoying as Elizabeth. Her giggling wasn't charming but ridiculous, her impertinence with Darcy came off more as petty rudeness than anything else and her lack of elegance, wit & grace was appalling. Lizzy never would let Darcy almost kiss her in the first proposal scene or yell like that while showing her teeth as if to bite him! McFayden neither has the handsome looks nor the mystery & arrogance needed for Darcy. He portrays him as weak, sweet and misunderstoof from the start, yech! It's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" not \\"Bitchy & Misunderstood\\"! The beautiful process of Darcy coming around because of love is destoyed completely because of this. We are left with an utterly bland romance, a defanged Jane Austen & P&P robbed of its wit, charm, fun and true love so that we may see a soapy, second class romance novel movie that is pretty useless. <br /> <br />Stick with the BBC Miniseries with the supreme Jennifer Ehle and Mr. Darcy himself: Colin Firth <br /> <br />Or even the other BBC Miniseries with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul.

0805066691|5.0|I just finished reading this book. This is the first book on Native Americans that I have read. It totally changed my point of view on the Native American and on the history of the Native Americans in this country. Putting political differences aside, this book is a must read for everyone. Unfortunately, some people might be turned off by its pro-Indian stance. The sad truth is that the histories that Brown chronicles are true. The American government of the time systematically cheated, killed, and humiliated the Native-Americans, so did the Mexican government. The American government deliberately stole lands that were worth millions from the Native Americans. These lands (black hills) are  currently being disputed and most appalingly, the government allowed the destruction of the Buffalo, which was a main source of food and resources for the Native Americans of that region. This book is insightful in its description of coercive methods of subjugation. Many which have been practiced by the government in different situations, specifically in recent wars. These methods include theft through broken treaties, the use of the media to propagate negative stereotypes and to whip up fervor against a group of people, the distortion of law against those who it was designed to protect(citizens and non citizens), the disregard for human rights by government agencies, the use of force and standing armies for the subjugation of people and the killing of innocent civilians.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately this is what this book is about and you can't sweep that under a rug.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I went to see this in the movie theater when it first came out, and I seriously was surrounded by a sea of grown women who were laughing out loud and hooting and hollering everytime Darcy was on the screen. It was hilarious, and what's better, my husband was laughing as loud in some parts along with the ladies! <br /> <br />This isn't a purely chick flick-it has alot of funny parts that help men get over the Darcy factor and his power to turn grown women into goofy squealers. And the father-daughter connection between Lizzy and Papa Bennet brought tears to my husband's eyes. <br /> <br />But make no bones about it-the power of Darcy lives on in the new guise of MAtthew Macfadyen, and he's adorable. I thought he was sorta ugly at the beginning of the movie actually, but by the end I let out a hoot or two myself! Macfadyen puts his own stamp on Darcy, Keira suprisingly didn't annoy me but came off quite LIzzy like, and this Mr. Collins really will leave you in stitches in some parts-he was a real audience pleaser. <br /> <br />If you like a good romantic comedy that includes bonnie lasses wondering all over beautiful English locales, beautiful boys in thigh high boots and tight riding pants, and their repressed desires that entertain you, this movie is for you.

Chris Rock's character the zebra is presented with a gift of a rectal thermometer from Mehlman and sputters \\"mother--\\"  The rest of it is cutoff of course, but I am disappointed that a children's movie would have a truncated version of such an expletive in it.  (I checked the captions and there it is).  I can't believe such a thing was scripted and if so it would have been so easy to replace with something else.   <br /> <br />Another inappropriate item is when Alex the lion has a dream about a steak which has obvious sexual overtones with his hand movements and verbiage.  I could live with that because I don't think the kids get it (but again, why put this in what is supposed to be a kid's movie?), but had I known about the suggestion of the M-F word, I would never have purchased the movie.  These are the reasons that Pixar runs circles around the other studios, because they can tell a good story without the base and suggestive humor.
0312979479|5.0|Ten strangers from multiple walks of life are invited to Indian Island, Devon under false pretenses.  Each of them harbors a dark secret, for each may have committed murder.  And collectively, they become a target for a vengeance-minded killer, patterning their deaths after a counting poem, \\"Ten Little Indians.\\"  As they die, one by one, it soon becomes clear that the killer is one of them, but only death can completely acquit them.<br /><br />I love a good mystery, but I have been hesitant to start reading the works of crime's high priestess.  I've seen a few films based on Agatha Christie's books, but given how prolific she was (80 novels and stories, many of which were \\"series\\" books), I just felt a slight panic at delving into her work.  So I started with her best loved novel, \\"And Then There Were None,\\" a stand-alone work. Now I'm feeling a little stupid for waiting for so long.<br /><br />Christie knew how to set a mood (duh!).  She introduces her characters in quick and broad strokes, revealing bits and pieces of all ten before they reach the island, explaining why they THINK they are there, and hinting at their guilty consciences.  Not surprisingly, it's hard to get a good grip on these characters in the first couple of chapters, as Christie rushes them along to Indian Island.  Granted, since a couple don't make it through the first night, Christie's broad approach is completely understandable.  But once the murders start, Christie slows down, taking her time to superbly examine the characters' fear and paranoia, and desperation.<br /><br />Moreover, Christie does a beautiful job of revealing the minds of these characters without giving any hint of whom the ultimate monster is.  The reader is in many ways just as susceptible to the fear that the characters are dealing with (except of course that the reader is never in any danger).  Even considering that several of them are out and out creeps, the reader can't help but feel empathy for them as they spend the weekend in an absolute panic.  It's very easy to understand the isolation and impotency the ten must face as they try to outwit their would-be killer.<br /><br />After this suspenseful romp, I am eager to look into Christie's work more fully.  Even if I don't, this one book has already made it into my list of favorite books.

B000001FMC|4.0|Swing Out Sister's jazz-inspired diva pop has always been on the fringes of the American mainstream (with their breakout hit being...yes...the most fun, poppy thing they've ever done).  I've always been a fan of the more mellow, melodic side of diva music, and Corrine Drewery is the perfect complement to the Whitney Houstons and Mariah Careys of the world.  It's Better to Travel doesn't disappoint.  It actually covers a fair amount of ground (cf. Fooled By a Smile to Communion) and doesn't have a single unpleasant track.  It even has a moment of sheer goofiness...play the Twilight World remix and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br />More like a languid cruise than a whirlwind European tour, but still a pleasant trip.

I was also way-layed to pick it up having checked Talib Kweli and Jean Grae rock a festival at the weekend here in NZ. A dope, dope set that saw Kweli's DJ, Chops drop SV's \\"Players\\" and Pharcydes \\"Runnin'\\" (Kweli's fav Dilla beat!)...touching stuff. Anyway, in the context of this and Jay Dee's death; as I rocked \\"Donuts\\" for most of today, it straight away hit me with its melancholy feel; oozing heart-break soul loops. I love it how it is at once classic J-Dilla, and also somethin' new. Big Madlib influences are apparent in it's raw touches and rapid-fire beat composition. Lib must be proud! This LP is superb headphone music, and i'm gonna have to dish some of these hot beats up on the FM dial! It is a real study in genius creativity, which would appeal to students of the musical arts as well as the hip-hop heads.   We have been feeling Dilla's passing heavy down here in NZ, respect to his family and peers.   R.I.P

A great companion DVD is \\"Live at the Isle of Wight\\" which covers roughly the same time period.  Anyone with an interest in the The Who or early 60's and 70's blues rock should not miss this one.

I have seen many movies converted from comics and Spawn was passed over by many. The clown and heavy metal music in some places may be a little abrasive to some, but the overall premise and delivery is not flawed. It may not be the caliber of Spiderman, but it certainly is a far cry from being a B movie. This is one definitely for fans of movies like \\"Hellboy\\" and \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentleman\\". I like Superman, Batman, and Spiderman, but it is a refreshing change to see something that is not your mainstream comic book hero from time to time.<br /><br />Spawn is based on a human man who works as a soldier that assassinates people for the government. When he realizes they are being used and wants to leave they decide his usefulness is ended. Meanwhile Satan is in the background waiting for this all to happen and when he is killed by his boss, he of course goes to hell and is made into a super powered spawn of the devil, hence Spawn. Spawn wants revenge on his boss and will do anything to get back to his wife and little girl. A pact with the devil gets him his wish, but not the way he thought. When he finds out his best friend married his wife after his death, he adds him to his list to kill. While all this is going on he meets a soldier of God and a demon who acts like a clown. The way he handles all this may be somewhat predictable, but still fun to watch.
0764113496|5.0|This is something like an expanded dictionary of the most common and useful Russian verbs. Other reference books will help you conjugate the verbs, but this one does it for you in a very complete way. Each verb is given an entire page. All forms of the verb are shown with the accent marks. I used this all the time when I was studying. Often I would use the standard formula to determine the proper verb form, and then I would use this book to check myself. Just looking at the pages helps you to get used to thinking of Russian verbs in all their conjugations. You could study Russian without this book, but if you have it, you will find it useful.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Well, where to begin... <br />Dear reader, I'm sure that with the amount of reviews available, that my one will probably not have a great impact. Nevertheless, this review serves also a selfish purpose, it is cathartic. So here goes. <br /> <br />I've never been moved as much by a film than I was with BBM. I hadn't really heard of it, other than the (awful) epithet \\"the gay cowboy movie\\". Having seen the film, I had to own the book and read the short story. The film carefully follows the storyline and elaborates only where necessary. The book, as well, complements the film. There are only minor discrepancies. However, having both read the book and seen the film, this review is based on both. <br /> <br />Let me get this straight. I'm not a fan of love stories, and Titanic was a boring session to me. I've never been a chick flick film goer. Which is why I was so surprised and confused at the same time by my reaction to the promotional trailer to BBM. The trailer connected with something deep within me (and, no, it wasn't the part of wanting to have sex with a guy), but it was the fact that it genuinely purveyed a different take on masculinity. Because yes, this film is 100% a study about masculinity, if not machism. So, I wanted to enlighten myself as to how men can be different, yet still manly nevertheless. It was very refreshing to see something different in regards to homosexuality than Will and Grace. I love the fact that this isn't about two guys who meet up in the local gay bar whilst dancing away to Madonna. <br /> <br />The key issue is the masculinity of the main characters' sexuality. As one critic accurately put it, we don't know whether Ennis and Jack (the main characters) are gay because the love each other, or whether they love each other because they are gay. Heath Ledger described Ennis as a homophobic man in love with another man. Jake Gyllenhaal even said he thought this was a film about two straight guys who fall in love with each other. Of course, this quote isn't entirely unproblematic, but I have sympathy for it. Their masculinity defines their sexuality, and they love all things masculine and being masculine themselves. In essence, this is a story about men who prefer the company of men  as opposed to women, and there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, I dare postulate that the only way this story is different from a story about two very good male friends is the fact that they have sex. According to Annie Proulx's short story in the story to screenplay book, it was common practice to send two ranch hands out at the same time, so that if they couldn't poke at the livestock, at least they could poke at each other. Usually, what happened on the mountain stayed on the mountain. Yet Ennis and Jack fall in love subsequently, which complicates thins altogether. <br /> <br />However, the real novelty is that the story is available to the public at large. We see/read things that usually wouldn't be shown in public. Such as the more tender occasions, for instance the embrace by the fireplace, where the issue is not so much sex, as it is emotional connection. This, in my opinion, is far more intense on the reader/viewer than any sex scenes, and far more novel (dare one say controversial, even?). And yet, why is it so strange to society at large to see two guys share a moment of tenderness? Women do it all the time; they kiss, hug, sleep together (not in a sexual manner), cry together, go to the toilet together etc. This is not so with men. But why shouldn't it be between good friends or family? And I can't see why it should be something that might label someone as being gay, because in my view, people are only gay if they desire somebody of their own gender sexually. Women who hug and kiss aren't necessarily lesbians for that matter, so why should men think that they are? <br /> <br />These are some of the more interesting questions about men and women that the story offers. It has definitely led me to review my own position on masculinity and what it is to be a straight guy. And also, the story has cemented the fact that masculinity is not reserved solely for straight men. ber-gay macho men aside, such as the Village People, gay guys can be as rough-spoken, stoic and reserved as any. <br /> <br />The symbolism of the story is also great. The names alone are a subject onto themselves: \\"Ennis del Mar\\", meaning \\"island of the sea\\", Jack \\"Twist\\", where a \\"twist\\" is apparently rodeo lingo for  a well developed ham string muscle. \\"Alma\\" means \\"soul\\". The word \\"Brokeback\\" is open to many an interpretation. My own favourite is the one that underpins the tragedy of the story; that the events that took place on the mounatain between Ennis and Jack metaphorically broke their hearts (and backs) afterwards. <br /> <br />This story is amazing. It's a wonder it hasn't been written before, but my praises go to Annie Proulx for having the courage to write it. There will never be another like it.

B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I own many DVDs but, of all of them, only a handful can I watch over and over again. They are almost comforting, like and old friend who stops by to visit from time to time. I have known true stories much like the ones they tell, making them even more believable and appealing to me. The Shawshank Redemption is one of them. It is a story of friendship, hope and redemption - not only for Tim Robbins' character Andy but also for Morgen Freeman's character Red. I could listen to Freeman's mellifluous, deep voice narrate the story for hours. I was also truly impressed with supporting cast members like James Whitmore, who played the old convict Brooks, too thorougly institutionalized to make it on the outside.  <br /> <br />Comparing it to Stephen King's novella, I would say I prefer the film - and not just because of the dramatic scenes, the spectacularly eerie shots of the outside of the prison, the spine-tingling musical score or the fact that two of my favorite actors play leading roles. The sequential order of the film, the choice of all of the characters and the personality that the prison itself takes on have perfected King's (superbly written, by the way) work. <br /> <br />This is without a doubt one of the best films ever made and it truly deserves the high praise it has received.

B000E33VWW|5.0|Two very engaging and very compelling things are centerpieces for works that people keep coming back to again and again: psychopaths and artists.  Especially when both are slightly insane or egotistic, the analysis of brains abnormal and uncomprehended are fascinating and wondrous motifs that re-occur in literature and media again and again.<br /><br />This movie has both, a very contradictory and egotistic mind, Truman Capote's, matched with the alarmingly sweet and charismatic mind of a psychopath, Perry Smith, who Truman falls in love with and interviews for research to write his best-selling and important work, In Cold Blood.<br /><br />The result is very affecting.  Hoffman's zealous and defined portrayal of Capote is matched by the outstanding performance of Clifton Collin's Jr., the lonely and slightly terrifying face of a killer who is human and humanized.<br /><br />The real drama comes from Capote's terrifyingly manipulative mind.  For someone who didn't know much about Capote before I entered the theatre, Hoffman's performance was simply shocking.  The commercials and advertising and posters and the like would have you imagine that Capote was a very strong artistic trope, like other biopics that show brilliant artists and their troubles.  However, a couple of things should be noted... first, this is not a biopic.  Second, Capote's flamboyantly homosexual and confrontationally controversial mannerisms both set the man himself apart from the type of character we like to see from artists, and also set Hoffman's performance apart from basically anything we've ever seen before.<br /><br />A side-result is a very discomforting and contradictory look.  Capote lies, manipulates, cheats... and yet the presentation of these events help us concern ourselves with his character so much that we can't help but want every part of his innermost desires to actualize.  We have a man who kills, but he's also lonely and afraid and willing to cling on to anybody who will give him attention.  We empathize with characters we'd normally shun, yet simultaneously feel uncomfortable being so close to them, thus wanting to know more about them so that we can come to terms with who they are.<br /><br />And at the end, when we see the denouement of what is both a perverse and a relatable relationship, the movie centers in on Smith's heavy breathing as he awaits his doom and the audience breaths heavily along with him, feeling all hope begin to fade from the screen as the deranged Capote watches on.  Now tell me that isn't great, great filmmaking.<br /><br />--PolarisDiBll give him attention.

B000021Y77|5.0|Rennt, Lola, Rennt is more than a passing fad and what once might have looked like a fast-paced gimmick, has turned to be a signature work of the unique new voice in the thriller genre. Tom Twyker continues to make great suspense flicks. I dare say he's developed into a great stylist in fullest command of his craft. A Hitchcock in the making for our generation. (That would be the generation X in case someone asked.)
B000A88F22|1.0|Okay, I own a Britney album or two. But the girl really let herself go... She should have stayed in school, instead of the Mickey Mouse Club. Or at least beauty school... or something, then she might have known that the hair she has now is hideous. I know I'm not the only one who thinks she's turing into Trailer Trash.. except, she's got money. That hair? Her Clothes? and lets face it guys, she was putting on weight WAY before she got pregnant.. Fashion senses aside.. She's really more IDIOTIC, that Chaotic.. she's got this princess in distress act that only her die hard fans can't see through.. I saw her in concert once, yeh I admit it. Paid for me and a friend to go. Was gonna go see the Onyx Hotel Tour too, just because.. But when I saw it on Showtime, I was SO Glad she canceled the tour and I got my money back. Her vocals were horrible, and it was so bad when MTV picked it up and they were obviously doctored.. she has absolutely no talent whatsoever.. and her vision is incredibly lacking... Her bland personality and complete naiivity and idiotic behavior makes itself evident in this show that isn't even bareable for a minute...  <br />I'd rather drag myself through Glitter, or Madonna's latest Tour Doc than sit through a single episode of IDIOTIC.  <br /> <br />I'm not a Jessica Simpson fan really.. But Newlyweds was hillarious, I loved that show.. Go for that INSTEAD of Chaotic if you're looking for something like that...  <br /> <br />No doubt, however, if you are a Britney fan... you'll end up with this anyway.. the whole brainless lot of you. (At least Mariah fans can say their girl can sing.. and at least Madonna fans can say their lady knows how to put on a fantastic show.. Britney.. well, she used to be pretty.)
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I may not be a movie critic, but I do enjoy movies and versions of Pride and Prejudice are a particular favorite.  I admit I am a Firth fan from way back but am always open to new interpretations and this one is probably the strangest and worst one I have ever seen.  Like Shakespeare, Austen's works can be easily and effectively adapted to many time periods.  I have see most if not all of the Austen-based movies and have enjoyed their charm as well as change of scenery and time periods.  The themes she utilizes are universal.   <br />     That being stated, this version is down right bizarre.  I understood a two hour movie would never have all the details needed to do this novel justice, however, when you start changing the customs, dicta, societal rules of the time peroid, you have ruined a major part of the story.  Since many other reviewers have gone into detail about the plot, I will refrain from any retelling.   <br />     Luckily for the audience, a lot of Lizzie's words were cut, especially her dialogue concerning being a gentleman's daughter.  Barefoot, wandering around in thin night clothes at dawn (this is cold, damp England by the way, not sunny California) and watching swine run through what looked like a part of the Bennet house, especially a house that truly needed a make over was odd enough, but Darcy apparently did not have a valet or anyone that was concerned about his grooming or public appearance.  (Neither did Mr. Bennet.)  Is this the best English society has to offer?   <br />  Overall, the acting that was shown (who knows what all is on the cutting room floor) was good.  The actors worked with what they had but I wonder if any of the actors had any clue what the director's vision really was. <br />  The part that bothered me the most had to be the midnight carriage ride of Lady Catherine.  What English lady (or any member of the gentry) would take a 50 mile ride in the dark?  No street lamps between Rosings and Longbourne, never mind the robbers, beggars, and other criminals that would be out at night, leaving Lady C with no protection other than the few footmen she might of had with her(Of course, you have no way of knowing how Lady C actually got to Longbourne).  And to top all that off, Lady Catherine was not even offended that Lizzie did not change clothes to talk to her.  Oh please, the rules of English society were not lax by any means and they got even stricter as time goes by until after WWII.  Add onto that the dawn meeting between Lizzie and Darcy in a field somewhere (in night clothes and very casual attire on Darcy's part) and you have truly entered a bizarre (definitely not an English society) world.  Lizzie's visit to Pemberly and the (non-portrait)sculpture gallery with the nudes amongst the bust of Darcy would never have been tolerated by Darcy himself(for Geogianna would never have been allowed to see any of the statutes, even of her brother, but they did portraits of people, not sculpture during that time period)much less non-married visitors of Pemberly.  (Did they feel that gave them the sex they needed for the movie?) <br />     If you want to modernize P&P, go ahead, have at it, but don't modernize it in the same time period and change all the rules, customs and dicta of the time period.  Movies in the last 20-30 years have consistently gotten better about creating accurate time portrayals when you look at movies in this genre.  The golden years of Hollywood were not very accurate, but they did not really even try, so it is not really an issue.  But in the 21st century, we have the knowledge and ability to know those rules, customs and dicta, so why trash them to make a quick buck.  The BBC series at least tried to do Austen justice.  No movie can ever totally create what we the reader are envisioning, but a movie can be accurate with known facts.  <br />This movie did an incredibly poor job at recreating this world.  The actors did a good job, but that is the only reason why I cangive this two stars.   <br />
B000002KNU|4.0|One of those debut albums that is clearly the beginning of a legacy, \\"Talking Heads '77\\" finds the band raw yet somehow fully formed.  At its best, it is absolutely brilliant, somewhat schizophrenic new wave pop, at its worst, quite frankly, it's not much different. <br /> <br />Having met in art school in Rhode Island, David Byrne (guitar and vocals), Tina Weymouth (bass) and Chris Frantz (drums) relocated to New York to pursue their destiny as a band, eventually adding Jerry Harrison to the mix (keyboards and guitar) from Jonathan Richman's Modern Lovers (highly recommended for anyone who enjoys this album).  The band performed Byrne's songs-- a fractured, paranoid, intelligent and yet goofy sort of off-kilter pop-- the key to his music is that you can't readily identify when it was recorded, it has that magic timeless nature to it such that if you played this album for someone who had never heard it, they'd have no reason to assume it was recorded nearly thirty years ago.  With Byrne's strained, frantic vocals and an unnervingly able and inventive rhythm section, the pieces all get superb readings. <br /> <br />Again, at its best it's brilliant schizophrenic pop-- from the deep groove of paranoid \\"Psycho Killer\\" to the mildly funky, building and paranoid \\"No Compassion\\" (the clearest pointer to what the future holds) to goofy-yet-serious chirping opener \\"Uh-Oh, Love Comes to Town\\" or the seemingly endless imagery of \\"Don't Worry About the Government\\".  The less intriguing tracks are pleasant enough (\\"New Feeling\\"), but often fairly unmemorable (\\"First Week/Last Week... Carefree\\") when compared to the rest of the record.  They'd probably stand out on anyone else's album, but the better material on here raises the bar. <br /> <br />A reissue just came out in dualdisc format, nicely remastering the sound to match the timeless quality of the music and adding several bonus tracks to both sides, this is a fantastic upgrade and well worth the extra couple bucks to get it. <br /> <br />Truthfully, the Talking Heads would go on to bigger and better things in the company of Brian Eno on their next three records, all pretty much flawless, but this one is essential.  Four stars without the remastering job, five with the cleaned up sound and the bonus tracks.  Recommended.
B0007P3582|5.0|No doubt, this album has a few club songs for the ladies, but ALL and ALL it was very well rounded. To me, it seems as if 50 decided not to be limited to \\"Da Hood\\" ,like some guys, and wrote to attract a larger audience; being himself at the same time. <br /> <br />Plus, if rappers like Jada and Fat Joe got the opportunities he got they would do the SAME THING. Watch out and see how GAME changes his style before the Album drops... he knows that \\"Da Hood\\" and \\"Compton\\" can't make him sell like 50!! So mark my word...he will cross over again, he not even a real Blood...how did that happen??? <br /> <br />Looking at the record sales... I think FiF won that battle. People should realize that 50's love for achievement and $$$ goes far beyond what we can imagine. So when rappers diss him or people say they hate G UNIT...its like adding gas to a fire b/c he sits back and laughs at all of you. <br /> <br />I will be honest and say that his recent acts are hypocritical but when you have the opportunity to make that much money... I don't blame hime for singing like K-Ci and Jo Jo!!! Lol.
B000002KO3|5.0|\\"Remain in Light\\" is the last of the three Talking Heads albums produced by Brian Eno that in many ways signalled the end of the band's peak era-- Eno challenged the band to a higher level and managed to get extraordinary performances out of them.  While much that followed by the band is a worthwhile listen, they'd never quite recapture the heights they reached with Eno in at the helm. <br /> <br />\\"Remain in Light\\" is also probably the most exploratory album by the band, augmented by Eno, a very young Adrian Belew, and vocalist Nona Hendryx.  From the skittering funk of \\"Born Under Punches\\" (with a superb ranted vocal by David Byrne) to the frantic energy and alternating vocals of \\"The Great Curve\\" (also a fine feature for Belew's pyrotechnics) to the calm and serene (and lovely) \\"Listening Wind\\" and the dark \\"The Overload\\", the album covers a significant amount of ground.  Along the way it also includes a fine performance by ambient trumpeter Jon Hassell (\\"Houses in Motion\\") and one song that became a hit a few years later (\\"Once in a Lifetime\\").  Bottom line-- there's something hear to please everyone, and it's all really quite well done. <br /> <br />This album, like the rest of the band's catalog, was recently reissued in dualdisc format completely remastered, this is quite a worthwhile sonic upgrade and is well worth the extra cost. <br /> <br />I've always felt that \\"Fear of Music\\" was the better album, but \\"Remain in Light\\" is probably the most accessible album by the band.  Highly recommended.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Very rarely does one see television of this calibre.  Firefly has it all:  excellent casting, superb acting, an intriguing story, and a bit of every genre you could ask for.  I bought it based only on the raving reviewa from several of my friends, and by the first episode I knew I wasn't going to regret it.  Firefly is an excellent series, and I highly recommend it.
B000002KZ6|3.0|An album that everyone but me seems to love, \\"Speaking in Tongues\\", the first Talking Heads album in three years when it came out, was also the first album since their debut not produced by Brian Eno, with the band taking over productions duties.  The band proves remarkably diverse, clearly embracing many of the sounds and ideas the members explored between albums, but all in all, I find the album lacks something that the records with Eno had. <br /> <br />And in truth, it may have that its Eno I find missing-- it's been my assessment that in the twenty years or so Eno was involved in \\"art rock\\" records, the material he worked on was the pinnacle of the form-- his own albums in the early '70s, John Cale's mid-70s trio for Island records, David Bowie's Berlin period, the turn of the '70s Talking Heads albums, U2's mid '80s albums... all of them are pretty much universally superb and among the best (if not the best) by the artist Eno was engaged with. <br /> <br />But enough of my Eno love fest, as the case may be, this album is without him and the band explores programmed rhythms, dance beats and funk, as well as a number of other forms.  The most noticable thing about the album is a number of the tracks are very dated-- they came from the '80s, it's pretty clear (\\"Slippery People\\", \\"Pull Up the Roots\\").  This isn't something that the Talking Heads is generally known for, their albums, particularly the early ones, have a unique timeless quality to them.  On the other hand, the band is emmensely talented, and principle songwriter David Byrne endlessly inventive, and even in this sort of corner, they successfully manages to pull off at least one utterly superb piece in the form of single \\"Burning Down the House\\".  Composed from a throwaway jam, the piece ends up being everything great Talking Heads is-- timeless, somewhat funky and jittery.  It works entirely too well.  And certainly when the band spreads their wings-- be it the slow groove of \\"Girlfriend is Better\\" (featuring one of the most self assured vocal Byrne delivered with the band), the blues ramble \\"Swamp\\" (with Byrne an octave lower than usual) and the light and delicate closer \\"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)\\"-- the music is superb.  The latter in particular is stunning, driven by delicately bouncing synthesizers with a fantastic gentle sound and superb vocal delivery from Byrne that introduces a sense of melancholy and gentle naivette that really makes it the standout of the record, even in the presence of \\"Burning Down the House\\". <br /> <br />This album (and the rest of the band's studio catalog) has recently received reissue on dualdisc and remastering with bonus tracks-- the sonic upgrade alone is worth the extra few dollars and I'd recommend that issue over this one. <br /> <br />But you know, in the end, a lot of people like this one a lot more than I do, and there may be a reason for that.  It's certainly worth investigating, but I think it pales in comparison to the three albums with Eno.  Newcomers to the band might do better starting with \\"Remain in Light\\".

Put simply, the series sounds superb-- crisp and clean and really fitting the timeless quality ofthe music.  The CD side adds five bonus tracks-- the band's first single (recorded without Jerry Harrison), the absolutely superb \\"Love-->Building on Fire\\", a song that defies explanation and is among the best thing the band ever did, a handful of b-sides (largely unmemorable but nice to have) and early (again, pre-Jerry Harrison) recording \\"Sugar on My Tongue\\", originally released as part of the \\"Sand in the Vaseline\\".  This final piece shows just how fully formed Byrne's songwriting and sound was, even early-- it captures all the manic energy and frantic sounds that make the band great and is a wortwhile addition.  The DVD side offers one of the b-sides, another mix of \\"Uh-Oh...\\" and a couple live video clips. <br /> <br />Truthfully, the Talking Heads would go on to bigger and better things in the company of Brian Eno on their next three records, all pretty much flawless, but this one is essential.  Four stars without the remastering job, five with the cleaned up sound and the bonus tracks.  Recommended.

B000002KNY|5.0|Conceivably the best album the Talking Heads ever recorded, \\"Fear of Music\\" is the band's second album in collaboration with producer Brian Eno, and it strikes a perfect balance between the strengths of the band and that of the producer.  The album ended up being significantly darker than anything the band had done previously, the manic and somewhat paranoid content of the music on the previous albums takes on a claustrophobic feel, and yet amidst all of this, the structures are at times brighter and looser than anything the band had previously done. <br /> <br />In a way, it's opener \\"I Zimbra\\" that probably best illustrates this-- featuring a polyrhythmic stew, a circular (pre-80s Crimson) and incredibly complex interweaving guitar lick from guest Robert Fripp and a chanted in harmony vocal-- it's quite unlike anything the Talking Heads have ever done.  It's also a work of complete musical genius. <br /> <br />What the piece does is add a sense of density to the music-- a sense that turns claustrophobic pretty much throughout, whether its the bizarre \\"Another Green World\\"-esque \\"Mind\\", the bubbling, chaotic and psychotic \\"Cities\\" or \\"Animals\\" (both of which feature rant-like vocals that end up providing extraordinary character to the pieces), or the murky and paranoid \\"Memories Can't Wait\\" (one of the real standouts on the album and maybe the darkest cut in the band's catalog) and fractured, black closer \\"Drugs\\", its the same band but its all different.  Along the way, there's a couple interludes to this-- \\"Life During Wartime\\" has a dance rhythm but lyrically matches the rest of the record, \\"Heaven\\" offers a pool of serenity and calm admist the insanity-- the chorus tells us \\"Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens\\", and somehow this proves true for the piece-- it comes and goes and feels like it barely happened but leaves an impression. <br /> <br />This album was recently reissued as a dualdisc-- I'd highly recommend that release, it has a sonic upgrade and a handful of bonus tracks that make it worth the extra cost over this release. <br /> <br />\\"Fear of Music\\", in the end, is one of those endlessly powerful albums that bears rewards upon repeated listens.  While it may not be representative of the Talking Heads as a whole, it is probably their best effort.  Essential.

B000CCD0FI|3.0|An album that everyone but me seems to love, \\"Speaking in Tongues\\", the first Talking Heads album in three years when it came out, was also the first album since their debut not produced by Brian Eno, with the band taking over productions duties.  The band proves remarkably diverse, clearly embracing many of the sounds and ideas the members explored between albums, but all in all, I find the album lacks something that the records with Eno had. <br /> <br />And in truth, it may have that its Eno I find missing-- it's been my assessment that in the twenty years or so Eno was involved in \\"art rock\\" records, the material he worked on was the pinnacle of the form-- his own albums in the early '70s, John Cale's mid-70s trio for Island records, David Bowie's Berlin period, the turn of the '70s Talking Heads albums, U2's mid '80s albums... all of them are pretty much universally superb and among the best (if not the best) by the artist Eno was engaged with. <br /> <br />But enough of my Eno love fest, as the case may be, this album is without him and the band explores programmed rhythms, dance beats and funk, as well as a number of other forms.  The most noticable thing about the album is a number of the tracks are very dated-- they came from the '80s, it's pretty clear (\\"Slippery People\\", \\"Pull Up the Roots\\").  This isn't something that the Talking Heads is generally known for, their albums, particularly the early ones, have a unique timeless quality to them.  On the other hand, the band is emmensely talented, and principle songwriter David Byrne endlessly inventive, and even in this sort of corner, they successfully manages to pull off at least one utterly superb piece in the form of single \\"Burning Down the House\\".  Composed from a throwaway jam, the piece ends up being everything great Talking Heads is-- timeless, somewhat funky and jittery.  It works entirely too well.  And certainly when the band spreads their wings-- be it the slow groove of \\"Girlfriend is Better\\" (featuring one of the most self assured vocal Byrne delivered with the band), the blues ramble \\"Swamp\\" (with Byrne an octave lower than usual) and the light and delicate closer \\"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)\\"-- the music is superb.  The latter in particular is stunning, driven by delicately bouncing synthesizers with a fantastic gentle sound and superb vocal delivery from Byrne that introduces a sense of melancholy and gentle naivette that really makes it the standout of the record, even in the presence of \\"Burning Down the House\\". <br /> <br />This dualdisc reissue is superbly remastered-- both the stereo CD side and 5.1 DVD side sound superb (this album in particular benefits from the additional space 5.1 allows) and a few bonus tracks are included-- each side contains an alternate mix of \\"Burning Down the House\\", the CD side adds an unfinished demo and the DVD side videos for the singles. <br /> <br />But you know, in the end, a lot of people like this one a lot more than I do, and there may be a reason for that.  It's certainly worth investigating, but I think it pales in comparison to the three albums with Eno.  Newcomers to the band might do better starting with \\"Remain in Light\\".
0393327655|1.0|How do you suppose ideas from this book should be implemented?  Maybe you should control peoples beliefs?  Dictate how they think?  How would you like to live in a society that dictates how you should think, feel, believe?  It sounds kind of like a reverse Taliban, don't you think?  You would end up in jail for carrying a Bible - same premise right?  I shudder with fear to know there are books like this out there that people are reading and agreeing with.  I am scared.

Additionally, the piece is augmented by bonus tracks on either side of the disc-- the CD side adds an incomplete demo from the sessions (\\"Dancing for Money\\") and three alternate takes-- the most exciting of which is an alternate of \\"Life During Wartime\\" with Fripp performing a frantic guitar line in the mix.  The DVD side adds a pair of live video clips from a television broadcast. <br /> <br />\\"Fear of Music\\", in the end, is one of those endlessly powerful albums that bears rewards upon repeated listens.  While it may not be representative of the Talking Heads as a whole, it is probably their best effort.  Essential.

B000BVQ9JO|3.0|As much as I adored 'is this it?' I didn't have high expectations for 'room on fire' as I didn't really see how they could progress their retro rock sound. Therefore I was blown away when I heard their second offering and even more excited about what the future held for strokes fans.  <br /> <br />Which brings us to 'first impressions of earth'. This album appealed to me immediately, but with repeated listenings I felt that I wasn't really listening to the strokes at all - but rather a U2 cover band. Its uncanny how much Julian sounds like Bono in parts of songs like 'you only live once' and 'fear of sleep' - but in saying that those songs are both great. <br /> <br />To me, most of the songs on this album sound like other bands (including b-side to juicebox 'hawaii aloha' which sounds remarkably like the ramones). There's juicebox (franz ferdinand) razorblade (chorus from 'mandy' by westlife?) 15 minutes (the pogues)  vision of division (pearl jam in the chorus) off the top of my head.  <br /> <br />Maybe its good that they do mimic other acts because the other songs on the album tend to be lacking in the songwriting department in comparison to previous strokes albums. Don't get me wrong, this is still a good album and maybe I will appreciate its diversity more in time, but right now I can't help but feel disappointed with this effort from my beloved strokes.  <br /> <br />It may win them new fans, which is good, but I just hope this doesn't spell the end for the strokes as we know them. <br /> <br />3 and a half stars
B00005JMFQ|4.0|If you like a movie that reflects all sides of love and commitment, I think this is the movie to see. For Americans it can be somewhat interesting challenge to follow for it's British sensitivities, but the point of the movie is well played out. The part of the Prime Minister was a bit overdone, but the love interest very enjoyable to watch. Also, the acting and delivery of the 'couple' that couldn't speak each other's language was well played. The skits about the couple who were nude standins didn't make much sense. But overall if the director wanted to give us a positive feeling about love and relationships, I think he achieved his goal.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I think this is the greatest album ever. Each and every song is great. They have talent, they rock my world, they just rock so hard. I need to meet Green Day right now because they rock. They <br />are the best band besides the all time great, Dire Straits. I love this album, I play this all the time, I want to review each <br />and every song on it. <br /> <br />1. AMERICAN IDIOT: Great song, it is really funny, it makes me laugh.  <br /> <br />2. JESUS OF SUBURBIA: I think this song is one of my all time favorite songs. It is really great, it has 5 different songs in 1 song. My favorite part is City Of The Damned, thus I made a huge city called that. Though my mom and my dad like Dearly Beloved. This has great boogie too. A song to repeat. 5 stars. <br /> <br />3. HOLIDAY: Great song, really funny, makes me laugh and you can stick your tongue out at this song. One of my all time favorites. <br /> <br />4. BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS: This is great, really great but overplayed. I hear this on a cellphone and it is really cool. I hear it lots on the radio. This used to be the only song I ever liked from Green Day but then I started getting addicted to the others that are better than this one. <br /> <br />5. ARE WE THE WAITING: Great slow song, brilliant. <br /> <br />6. ST. JIMMY: Great fast rock song. Another one of my favorites on the album. <br /> <br />7. GIVE ME NOVACAINE: This song is a little bit sadder than the rest but it is still a really great song.  <br /> <br />8. SHE'S A REBEL: Great but not really a favorite. <br /> <br />9. EXTRAORDINARY GIRL: I love the bongoes and the music, excellent.  <br /> <br />10. LETTERBOMB: Not bad. Maybe this one is my least favorite out of the 13. <br /> <br />11. WAKE ME UP WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS: Tre Cool kicks ass in this song. They used to play this on the radio a lot, and I didn't like it but then it started to grow on me and I like it a lot. It is a great song. <br /> <br />12. HOMECOMING: You will bang your head so hard on this song especially the last part We're Coming Home Again. Great opening. <br />I kinda think Jesus Of Suburbia is better. It is great.  <br /> <br />13. WHATSERNAME: I really love this song. I think it is worth repeat over and over and over again. It is my favorite song on the whole album. I have a girl called Whatsername. The best way to close this great album. <br /> <br />Excellent album. Go buy this masterpiece with Warning (Green Day), On The Night (Dire Straits), Brothers In Arms (Dire Straits), On Every Street (Dire Straits), & Greatest Hits (Guns N' Roses).  <br /> <br />And remember Green Day isn't punk. They are a alternative band plus they play hard rock. The Last Great Album Of My Records.
B000089RV6|5.0|This album is simply amazing.  It comes at you all out from the beginning and never lets up.  This is proof that rock and roll doesn't have to be fancy to be amazing.  The booming drums come straight at you with nothing fancy but they get the job done in a big way.  It is a wonderful experience to hear how the vocals, guitar and drum come together to create an amazing sound. <br /> <br />Most any other band would be proud to put this forth as a greatest hits album for their career while to AC/DC it is just another great album. <br /> <br />I love this whole album but my favorite track is \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" followed closely by \\"Back in Black\\", \\"Hells Bells\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\". <br />
B000002UAX|5.0|I won't say that the Beatles suck. They made at least 10 good songs. The other stuff other than those 10 suck. Anyway, I love this album because of BIRTHDAY.

B00004ZAV3|3.0|I don't like this compilation, it is truely a lame set. Thus the Beatles only made 10 good songs. Hey Jude would be my personal favorite from the whole set. This set has too many old songs. Thus, there are no guitar solos, or hard rock. Where is that? The Beatles really do suck. If you want a good Beatles compilation, I recommend you to find Past Masters Vol.2 insted. <br />Try these bands insted that really rock hard, Green Day, Dire Straits, & Guns N' Roses. <br />

B000E1YW0E|5.0|I too saw Rent on Broadway 2 years ago with my husband and loved it.  But for some reason I didn't run right out after and buy the music cd.  But I did right after seeing the movie and haven't stopped listening to it yet.  I went to see the movie with my daughter (she's 20) (she never saw it on Broadway) and we loved every minute of the movie. It was fun to watch her reaction not knowing really the storyline for rent.  She and I half way through the movie looked at each other and said  \\"have to buy it when it comes out on DVD.\\"  The music is unbelievable, the actors performances and talents, the moving storyline, etc.. I'm sure the movie has it's flaws but I didn't see them.  I found a better perception of each scene from the movie as opposed to the play. I found the play harder to follow, still wonderful but I really enjoyed the movie.  I cannot wait until tomorrow to get the DVD when it goes on sale.  I haven't seen a movie in years that right after seeing it I could have purchased another ticket and gone right back in for the next showing. See the movie, it is fabulous!
B000002MFE|3.0|First off, I'm a pretty big Clapton fan. I own all his stuff from the Bluesbreakers, Cream, and Blind Faith plus the Derek and the Dominoes studio album, One More Car, One More Rider, The Cream of Clapton, and this CD. Clapton is undoubtedly one of the finest guitarists of all time, as well as one of my favorites. My four favorite guitarists are Mike Bloomfield, Duane Allman, Peter Green, and Mr. Clapton. So I'm not a reflexive Clapton hater.  <br /> <br />That said, do yourself a favor and avoid this CD unless you really want to hear some Delta-style Blues from Clapton. The essence of Clapton is emotive Chicago Blues and Blues-Rock, neither of which can be found here. Instead you'll find some re-worked Chicago Blues classics like Muddy Waters'Rollin' and Tumblin'(which can be found in a more exciting, electric version on Fresh Cream) and Bo Diddley's Before You Accuse Me and some Delta Blues Classics like \\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\\" (which, again, can be found electrically on Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs). The only original material here is \\"Signe\\" which is an interesting but inconsequential introduction and Tears in Heaven, written for his recently killed four year old son. Tears in Heaven is a fantastic song. It's an emotionally raw dirge which features Clapton's plaintive wail. But it's not the blues by any measure, more comparable to Wonderful Tonight or Change the World than any of Clapton's excellent guitar workouts that one him his godly reputation.  <br /> <br />The record's greatest sin is the reworked acoustic version of Layla, which is stripped of its famous and fantastic riff, soaring and emotive guitar solos, and Jim Gordon's lovely piano coda- the three elements that made the song worth your listen in the first place. It is a revealing historical document however, as it shows us what the song likely looked like before Duane Allman wrote the riff and sped up the tempo. <br /> <br />If you're looking to start a Clapton collection,I highly recommend Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs by Derek and the Dominoes, Fresh Cream or Disraeli Gears by Cream, or the Cream of Clapton if you're looking for an overview of his career.
B00005JOII|3.0|I won't recap the plot, since everyone else hits the basics and more. I was drawn into the story, and even (somewhat) sympathetic to the dilemma of the main character. Until, of course, it took a criminal turn.  <br /> <br />No, what disappointed me was that this was supposed to be a story about luck, and how that affects us more than we know. However, the resolution to the story--Chris first being a suspect, then escaping investigation--depended more on coincidence (that is, the writer saving the character) than it depended on luck.  <br /> <br />What's worse, it had more holes in it than the murder plot itself: It's hard to believe the over-pressed police dept would concern themselves with the diary of a random murder victim; but if they did, they would know that Chris had a powerful motive. And, unless Chris disposed of the evidence in Nola's actual neighborhood (and there is nothing to show that she lived near the river), the bit of \\"good luck\\" that gets him off the hook is too incredible to be believed. <br /> <br />The one thing I did like was the near final scene where Chris' victims come back to talk to him; that gave me genuine chills, although I could see it was a theatrical technique.

1573228737|4.0|Waters is able to create a strange moody literary landscape--one that would never be in a bestseller.  For me this is refreshing and interesting.  Waters crafted the beginning and middle of the novel very painstakingly--I appreciated the craft but at times I wanted a little more variation in pace.  She actually takes you into the musty constrained world of a slightly hysterical spinster--and makes it interesting because she unearths the passion underneath the surface.<br /><br />The ending felt a little rushed--but this might be because it was jarring and sudden for the protagonist and Waters brought me into her world.<br /><br />All in all a worthwhile read that takes you to another time and place!!
B000001E8P|5.0|Life changing?    When I was 13 I had a rather bizarre, misplaced obsession with Oasis; I bought every publication that contained their mere name, including outrageously expensive import British music magazines which also conatined the name of the now ever-blessed Pulp.  While I still have a fondness for Definately Maybe, Oasis is pretty much out of my system; ten years later, Pulp is not.    For me, Pulp's Different Class was Life Changing.  Prior to Plup I had only listened to mainsteam, regular sound; this album was a smack to my head, a concussion really, a concussion from which I have never recovered.  No album, not even albums' I like better, have had more influence over the way I have come to think about music, and, believe it or not, life.  Pulp single-handedly widened my aural, lyrical, and analytical spectrums and made me a appreciate the many facets of serious music.    Most of you reading this review are neither thirteen nor impressionable.  Pulp is a band that carries a great deal of personal meaning for me, and that will clearly not be the case for every listener.  Pulp, however, is great, original music unto itself, and Different Class is a prime example of their uniformly superb albums.      Buy this album and you will laugh and mourn with Jarvis Cocker.  And hey, you may ever change you life; amid the crazy Pop you will Cry.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|This is a decent adaption of the Broadway play. Jesse L. Martin is the only reason I feel the need to own this DVD. He is remarkable! <br /> <br />I take offense to the person who suggested that teens don't need to see homosexuals and trangendered people. That's crazy talk. Did you ever consider that perhaps there are many teens who ARE homosexual and/or transgendered? They deserve to see themselves reflected. Personally, I don't get why a PG:13 means there will be nothing but straight white people copulating. That sounds kind of ignorant to me. Sorry but I think you are a little homophobic. Nobody's youth is going to get away from them just because they are exposed to gay people.
B000063UR2|5.0|Tom Cruise and Mia Sara (why don't we see more of her?) portray  the innocent love, that we all yearn for, amidst a magical, beautiful forest in a time, we romantasize about. The lavish back-drops, costumes and creatures don't go unnoticed. The story is never dull, nor feels dragged out and at the end, it makes you want for more. I am very happy to have purchased this movie for my collection and watch it frequently; even bought a copy for my adult daughter as a present. <br />Well worth having
0393327655|3.0|After hearing the author talk about this book On C-Span,  I ( as I so often do) became excited,  bought a copy, read half of it, and permanently shelved it.  Maybe that doesn't qualify me to write a review,  but here are a few thoughts. <br /> <br />Sam Harris doesn't strike me as a man on a quest to find answers to any of life's mysteries.  If you're looking for that here, I wouldn't recommend this book.  From the outset,  the tone is one of cynicism,  absolutism, and intolerance.  There seems to me to be no appreciation for the human struggle to find answers to questions which will undoubtedldy never be answered,  but rather a one-sided focus on the minority of so-called \\"religious\\" people who choose violence and hate as the ultimate expression of their beliefs.   <br /> <br />His simplistic response to man's quest to come to grips with the ultimate mystery is simply to categorize all people of religious persuasion as naive, ignorant, or dishonest.  Granted,  he does mention Mother Theresa, Gandhi, and a few others as exceptions; in fact, it is the suicide bomber who is the exception;  the right wing hate-espousing Christian fanatic who is the exception.  Harris legimately points out  the violence of the Crusades,  the Inquisition, torture, the conspicuous inactivity of the Catholic Church during the rise of Nazism,  but there is little or no mention of the Vatican II Council which was the Church's effort to deal with it's future role to prevent these actions ( and inactions) from occuring again.   <br /> <br />Historical figures such as Gandhi, the current Dalai Lama,  Pope John Paul II, and other people of indisputable leadership and genuine good will have the ability to extract the positive aspects of many different religions and use that as inspiration to do good works are true heroes to me. They can see through the literal interpretation of various religious texts and consolidate them into an ultimate Good.  Although the final answers are certainly not known,there is at least an appreciation for the great mystery,  which is something Harris is apparently not open minded enough to see.   <br /> <br />I would recommend studying with an open mind each of the religions that Harris discusses in his book,  and drawing your own conclusions.  I would hope your view  of the human condition is one not so cynical as the author's.

Get it.
0679601686|5.0|For many years I considered Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" to be one of those many required readings from high school that was meant to be tediously plowed through.  Was I ever wrong!<br /><br />While the language is more proper and formal than what we are used to today, and certainly the customs and arrangements are very different, P&P is in many ways a simply timeless love story about two people who seemingly dislike each other at first sight, but who are truly so right for one another.  A century or two will not diminish this romance!<br /><br />At the heart of the story is the Bennet family, a family that has been \\"cursed\\" with five daughters and no sons to inherit the family's home and estate - - lovely, softspoken oldest daughter Jane, spunky and spirited Elizabeth, bookish, serious, almost dour Mary, silly, giggly Kitty and flirty, precocious and spoiled Lydia.  Mrs. Bennet's sole consideration and worry in life seems to be finding appropriate husbands for her daughters, mostly so that once Mr. Bennet dies, she shouldn't be kicked out of her home with nowhere to go.  It will quickly become apparent to the reader that Mrs. Bennet's favorite child is Lydia, mostly because Lydia seems the closest reflection to Mrs. Bennet's character herself.<br /><br />Into this story comes the Bingley and Darcy families - - sweet, good natured Charles, who quickly falls in love with Jane, his critical, judgmental sister Caroline, who secretly yearns for marriage to Charles' best friend, Mr. Darcy, who seems uninterested in the entire endeavor.<br /><br />As with most romance stories, the road to true love is a bumpy one.  Mr. Darcy, although obviously finding Elizabeth attractive, feels that her station in life is beneath his.  Elizabeth finds his pride and aloofness infuriating.  Jane and Mr. Bingley, although in love, are torn apart by his sister, who believes that a marriage to one of the Bennet girls would be most unfortunate for her family.  Add the arrival of Mr. Bennet's cousin, Mr. Collins, who as the next male of kin will inherit the Bennet home - - and his frantic search for a bride and Mrs. Bennet's efforts to assist him; Elizabeth's dear friend Charlotte, a spinster of twenty-seven who accepts what life has offered her and makes some difficult choices of her own, in order that she might be merely content with her arrangements; Mr. Darcy's haughty aunt, and Mr. Collins' benefactress, Lady Catherine De Burgh, who has serious aspirations of her own to make Mr. Darcy her daughter's husband; the seductive Wickham, who shares a secret past with the Darcy family and catches the impressive Lydia's eye, nearly bringing downfall to the Bennet family.<br /><br />All in all, this was an incredibly satisfying story on all fronts - - a rich character study, an earnest romance, and comedy.  The ending seemed almost rushed and an afterthought - - but perhaps because I had fallen in love with the stories and characters, I simply did not want P&P to end.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0001FGBL6|3.0|I liked the choral harmonies on tracks like the opening \\"Adyta\\" and thought the lyrics, when I could understand them, were thought-provoking (though sure to annoy religious conservatives).  I even tolerated Mark Jansen's growling.  However, I would have liked a stronger, more confident vocal performance from soloist Simone Simons.  Often, she seemed hesitant and unsure.  She mumbled rather than sang her words--which made it difficult to understand the lyrics without looking at the liner notes.  At other times, when she sang near the top of her range, she sounded tense and shrill, as if she needed more breath support and space to stay on pitch (e.g., \\"Facade of Reality\\").  Finally, I would have liked more song variety.  After a few listens, all of the songs sounded the same to me.  In my opinion, this cd is good for the occasional listen but not something I could listen to everyday.
0380778556|5.0|Rebecca, by Daphne Du Maurier, has rightly deserved to be considered a literary masterpiece.  Part mystery, part thriller, part gothic and one hundred percent genius!<br /><br />Most of the story is set at Manderley, an old family estate in England, where our intrepid heroine, whose name is never revealed to us, returns as a happy, but unsure, newlywed.  Her new husband, Maxim, lived at Manderley with his first wife, Rebecca, who died a drowning death under mysterious circumstances the year before.  That would be enough to handle for any young wife, but add to the mix Maxim's aloof nature, the constant reminders of the beautiful, seemingly perfect Rebecca, from her portraits to her monogramed belongings, to her maid, the creepy Mrs. Danvers and you have a story that is set to explode! An original, never-see-it-coming twist at the end makes this tale extremely gratifying.<br /><br />Definitely 5 stars.<br /><br />For an added bonus, check out the 1940 movie of the same name with Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine.  Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the black and white film is a wonderful adaptation of the book!
B0007PAMR4|4.0|If you're a major Dune fan, ignore the bad reviews and pick this up, a steal for $20.00. David Lynch's Dune is a curiosity at best - it's a minor miracle that we've been given a SE with *any* bonus materials at all. Until the film itself is cleaned up and restored, this is as good as it gets. The four 5 minute featurettes are very well done and the image gallery is not bad. <br /> <br />The Extended Edition of the film runs to almost 3 hours. It was put together by the studio (Universal) to be shown on television. They used to split it over two nights - factor in the commercial breaks and you'll understand why there's so much repitition in this cut. Music is hacked up and cut into scenes with very little care and some things could have been done better (like the prologue & narration). However, in this cut *much* that was missing is retored and overall the quality of the EE print is better than that of the theatrical cut included on this disc. The deleted scenes fill in more gaps. <br /> <br />Yes, one day Lynch is going to have to face the fact that this film has fans who would love to see it fnally finished. It's happened to similar films (Blade Runner, Star Trek 1) so it may happen with Dune one day. Just by looking at what's on this disc, I'd say there's enough material to make an 'official' 3 hour cut that would be a major improvement over the theatrical cut. <br /> <br />For now, this is THE dvd to get of the '84 Dune. Enjoy! <br /> <br />
0385338686|5.0|Ok, so the plot is implausible... the youngest ever partner of London's biggest legal firm being mistaken for a housekeeper and accepting the position! Yet the story is so emotionally accurate that it is easy to overlook. As a reader, we become a part of Sam, living in her fast-paced business world with no life of her own. From this perspective the transformation is remarkable; we feel her frustration in performing menial tasks, then her joy in creating something tangible, and finding love and friendship with Nathaniel and Iris. In the end, she sees that her lifelong dream may never have truly been hers, and that happiness can be found in a berry patch. This book will make you feel good.

B00008AB5D|5.0|Finally a CD that covers all years of the Whitesnake catalog instead of just the \\"Slide It In\\" through \\"Slip Of The Tongue\\" eras of the band. The most enjoyable part for me is the addition of the 1983 video version of \\"Guilty Of Love\\" for the first time which so far is only available here (except the deleted VHS video). This CD is the best Whitesnake compilation since 1983's \\"Best Of\\" set which is now extremely hard to find...
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Once again the angel from the Emerald Isle has descended from above to grace us with a -12 track- collection of enchanting, multi-layered tunes performed by the most beautiful voice in the world today.<br /><br />Enya has not strayed from the gloriously textured sound that she is famous for and I for one like it that way. When you do something so well that is also so beloved it's best to leave perfection alone. I'm not sure if there's a song in this latest collection that will ever be a stand-out the likes of 'Orinoco Flow' or 'Only Time', but it's way too early to try and make such a determination. Either way, for all those parched ears that have waited five long years for her next release, drink deeply from the CD 'Amarantine.' You will not be disappointed.

B0001NBMBC|1.0|Its kinda funny that slipknot sells albums because the only people that listen to them are 12 year olds and posers. I heard this album in my friends car stereo because we were satisfying his little brother. This cd like the others is just pure garbage and noise. Theres no talent to it, its like lincoln park they just write the same song about 30 times and give it a bad title. If you want real metal go pick up Slayer Reign in Blood and Seasons of the Abyss. Sepultura Arise and Roorback. Pantera Vulgar display of Power and Far Beyond Driven. The list goes on, and the truth of the matter is in 10 years slipknot wont even exist anymore.
B000000OQF|5.0|this album needs to be played loud to really be enjoyed, with hits you will know such as the rockin \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" to the great \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" or the classic \\"Paradise City\\" as well as heaps of other great songs such as \\"Rocket Queen\\" or \\"Its so Easy\\" this is great from start to finish.  <br /> <br />Watch out for Axl in 2006  <br />[...]
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is a book that keeps you captivated and wanting to read more. The world Lois Lowry writes about is easy to get caught up in and makes you feel like your there right beside Jonas living what he is living. The journey of Jonas makes you think and see things and in various new ways. This is a book that you could read over and over and always have a new question pop into your head.
0446677450|4.0|I am really impressed with the writing in this book. Being a new comer in the world of investing and money management I feel this book is written for someone like me to understand and to put into motion. I was so capture by this book that I immediately went out and brought five other book from Robert kiyosaki. I really recommend anyone who care about a well balance financial future these series of books are a required reading. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B000006NUW|5.0|Classic cuts abound in this four disc boxed set. The biggest names in Motown soul are displayed here. A must own for any collector of early Motown and a great companion to Motown 2 (the later years).
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|Like the other reviewers, I love this album.  As a fan of Paul Simon's music all the way back to his early S&G days, this is my favorite. <br />Be aware however that is world music, not pop music.  True it is more melodic than most world music but is not for everyone.  For instance some of my family members (who like Graceland, etc...) do not enjoy this album. <br />Nonetheless, I totally recommend it and believe it is one of the best albums ever recorded.     <br /> <br />
B00002MZ4V|5.0|This 2 disc set has some of the highlights of his magnificent career up until 1999. His movie scores total 80+ and include the 'Star Wars' saga, 'Close Encounters of...', 'Superman', and 'JFK'. If you are a movie goer of any degree, you have heard his work. This is a great set to purchase for many reasons whether or not you are a classical music fan.
B000E8N690|5.0|I recently saw this in the theater and had mixed feelings going in. The story seemed similar to last year's Oscar winning biopic on Ray Charles and I wasn't sure a story about Johnny Cash would hold my interest for two hours. After all, this was the singer my dad used to listen to. Little did I know how fascinating Cash's tale would be. <br /> <br />The story touches on Cash's childhood and the tragedy and abuse that would provide the basis for many of his songs. Johnny Cash didn't have the nicest voice but when he sings about pain and regret, you honestly believe he's inside Folsom Prison. Most of the film charts Cash's inevitable path from aspiring songwriter to cultural icon. He has the expected bumps along the way but the tale ends up being inspiring. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon turn in Oscar worthy performances as Cash and his wife and frequent collaborator June Carter Cash. A fun part of the films is that Johnny and June were contemporaries of Elvis, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis and we get to see them represented as well.  <br /> <br />These kinds of movies are good for people of my generation because they bring home exactly how innovative and visionary the performers of the past were. It's easy to hear Johnny Cash's voice over an Alamo commercial or see Ray Charles crooning about Diet Pepsi and think they are just silly old men trying to milk their fame. Movies like this make us reinvestigate their pasts to see exactly how trend setting they were. Johnny Cash and Ray Charles were cool, they were the very essence of cool. It would be difficult to imagine the performers of today, many of whom are overindulged and overrated, paying the kinds of dues these guys did and coming up with anything as unique. <br /> <br />
B0000DG00B|4.0|I must admit that I am biased towards the Allman Brothers At Fillmore East or The Fillmore Concerts. I guess \\"You Don't Love Me\\" missing from this set causes me to favor the Fillmore set but none the less it is an essential piece for any fan of those Georgia boys.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|Many people have (somewhat wrongfully, in my opinion) lambasted this movie by dwelling on the perceived overuse of special effects and the subtle changes to the plot of the original book. Quite frankly, while these charges are at least somewhat true, these people fail to enjoy this movie for what it is--a modern reinterpretation, rather than an outright remake. <br /> <br />Case-in-point, many people reading this might not realize that H.G. Wells was going for strict social commentary when drawing up the Morlock and Eloi. The biological distinction was intended to mirror the class distinction that was beginning to spread as the western world industrialized towards the end of the 19th century. Naturally, this notion is virtually meaningless in a post-industrial service economy such as the United States or England, where the vast majority of the people have better standards of living than they did when H.G. Wells wrote this book. Thus, it only seems natural that the movie-makers would alter a few major plot elements in order to more accurately explain this situation from a modern point-of-view (i.e., the destruction of the moon). Incidentally, I think this was actually quite well done: the writers show how our hubris ends up being our downfall. But none of this is particularly new. The previous film version chalked it up to nuclear war, a far more plausible notion at the time it was made. Therefore, while they may have tweaked a few plot elements, they serve the movie quite well, and add a nice coherent feel to the overall presentation. <br /> <br />I am honestly a little offended that this movie was not nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. Klaus Badelt is a timeless genius, on par with (and possibly greater than) Hans Zimmer. The dramatic overtures during the time travel sequences and the moving world music motifs during the scenes with the Eloi (highly reminiscent of certain Polynesian and African pieces) were enough to bring me to my knees. On the whole, I think the music was incredibly appropriate for this movie; much more so than a lot of the random mainstream songs haphazardly cobbled together for certain genres of movies. <br /> <br />In general, I greatly enjoyed this movie as a piece of fun escapism. For the record, I enjoyed the original H.G. Wells novel, and I think the producers did a reasonably good job modernizing it. I would recommend this movie to fans of classic science fiction only if they are not strict traditionalists when it comes to scripts and willing to keep an open mind.
B000009HF2|5.0|A pure 70s live album that merits the high honor as one of the top selling live albums of all time. 'Show Me The Way' and the talk box gem 'Do You Feel Like We Do?' are the highlights of this album but there is much more to this disc than just those two radio worn tunes. Frampton's best work is worth a listen for any fan of live classic rock.
B0007XT87G|5.0|At the risk of spouting nothing but hyperbole, I can honestly say that this album is flawless.  A masterpiece.  The best cd of 2005.  One of the best ever.  Yes, it really is that good.     With \\"Deadwing,\\" Porcupine Tree managed to combine their newer slightly metallic sound with their pop sensibilities and their lush atmospheric side, ala their earlier material like \\"Up the Downstair\\" and \\"Signify.\\"     As always, the production is tremendous.  Every instrument is very clear and there is a perfect amount of separation so the music has plenty of room to breathe and draw the listener in.  I don't think I've ever heard a better drum sound that the one producer/songwriter/guitarist/vocalist/musical extraordinaire Steven Wilson achieved on the song Halo.     This is, in my estimation, the fourth consecutive five star-album Porcupine Tree has released and they are showing no signs of letting up.  One would think that after gems like \\"Stupid Dream,\\" \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" and \\"In Absentia,\\" they would be running out of ideas, but they managed to top themselves once again.
B000022TSY|4.0|The picture and sound quality of the DVD transfer are very high quality, and the special features on the disk make what was already a good movie even more enjoyable and much more meaningful.<br /><br /> There are modern day interviews with most everyone in and involved with the making of the film that offers a lot of insight into the symbolism, and the day to day occourance of what went into making the film, as well as the mind set of those involved at the time.<br /><br /> Highly recomended !
B00004Y6NW|5.0|In 1978 Punk was still at its hight and most of the public catered to it and shunned artists of more traditional rock and blues sounds.  The old pub rock of the 60s and 70s with its stripped down and simple rock music was later given a dose of adrenaline and everybody got punk rock.  Dire Straits however kept pub rock the way it originaly was and added some pop elements to it and hence created one of the most popular Pop/Rock outfits of the 70s and 80s.  Mark Knopler armed with his steel six string and the rest of the band providing a wonderful rhythm section created an excellent debut with their combination of blues, jazz, country, and old fashioned rock-n-roll. <br /> <br />Though most of the music sounds happy and uplifting much of the lyrical content has a slightly darker and more serious taste to it.  Though there are often refrences to failed or sometimes successful romances, the romatic values of the music tend to be just one of the many factors that make up the overall fabric of the album rather than the dominant theme as in most Pop/Rock albums.  Knopler's songwriting and his lyrical delivery rivals Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen, especially on the progressive epic, \\"Sultans Of Swing\\".  His soloing on the guitar, which apparently makes no use of distortion is amazing.  Imagine Eric Clapton on a non-distorted guitar and you get the idea.   <br /> <br />Dire Straits would later go on to make more hardrocker mainstream albums which would be just as good as this one, but none of them would sound as fresh or as original as this one. <br />They would even go on to be one of the few quote, \\"old fashioned sounding bands\\", to receive critcal air time on MTV, particulary with the CG video, \\"Money For Nothing\\".  To see what led up to those moments you should purchase this album and see what happened when a group re-established old ideas in contradiction to what was mainstream at that time.
B00011RPB0|4.0|I can certainly relate to the main female character Charlotte and understand her fascination with an older man.  She's much too independent for her own generation.  I remember my college days, my pseudo-platonic romances with professors.  I dated boys my age, yet I found emotional and intellectual fulfillment in friendship with my professors.<br /><br />In the movie, Charlotte and her actor friend are equally lost and equally lonely.  The difference is that Charlotte is young, and she still has plenty of time ahead of her to turn her life around.  Her actor friend, on the other hand, has left his better days behind.  I think that if Charlotte and her friend were on the same page chronologically, they could really build a future together.  Sadly, all they will ever have is the memory of the kiss they shared.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This CD is really great, there are the Hard Rock Songs to get you head banging: Forgotten, Freak Out, and Together.  Then there are the power ballads that make think: How does it Feel, and Don't tell me.  If you liked the first album this is a must have, if you didn't like the first one give it a try cause it is awesome.
B0000AUHPK|2.0|I know that you're not supposed to question the merit of Victorian classics, but I will commit the ultimate blasphemy and say that \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is not a very good book.  Emilie Bronte just doesn't not measure up to her sister Charlotte.  At least in \\"Jane Eyre\\" there is actual drama, tragedy, mystery.  None of that is present in \\"Wurtherin Heights\\".  It's a provincial laid-back coming of age story.<br /><br />First of all, the whole love element is very clumsily executed.  I just can't imagine how you can develop romantic feelings for someone who's been like a brother to you for over 10 years.<br /><br />Second, when Victorians try to experiment with multiculturalism, they fail miserably.  Who is Healthcliff after all?  Is he a gypsy or an Indian prince?  The ambiguity of his origin is quite laughable.  There is a good reason why you should write about what you know.  Emily Bronte obviosly did not know the difference between a gypsy and an Indian.  To her it was all the same.  As long as the man is not English, he can be a Maori, for all she cares.  Mr. Fiennes, the actor, is better off playing an English patient, who is actually a Hungarian nobleman, than an Indian-gypsy prince.<br /><br />Third, the actors in this particular movie are too old.  In the book they are supposed to be in their early 20s.  Well, in the movie they look well in their mid-30s.  A little too old to steal first kisses, don't you think?
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I personally have never listened to the album. But my son has and he thinks that this is a kick ass album. With the face melting guitar solos and intricate drumming patterns. City of Evil makes A7X's previous albums look like antique masterpieces.
6304806426|4.0|I heard distubring rumors that the filming of the movie nearly came to a halt because Kristen Scott-Thomas did not rank very highly with audiences, that the director was actually pressured into replacing her with Michelle Pfeifer.  Let me tell you, I am soooo thankful that Kristen Scott-Thomas ended up playing the female lead.  It takes a strong English actress with a background in Shakespearean theater to play such a dramatic role.
B0000024LN|5.0|Reggie Noble spits nothing but fire on his third solo release.  The beats are a little less based on P-Funk samples, but they are still funky enough; they tend to hint more at old school bass heavy East Coast beats.  Redman is as entertaining as ever with his witty and eccentric humor.  Method Man nakes an appearance with Redman on the hit track  \\"Do What ya feel.\\" The two have an incredible rapping history, and make great hits together.  Don't sleep on this classic album
B000BT97AO|1.0|Why do I dislike this film so much?  Because, bottom line, it's pretty damn unexceptional.  I'm not saying it's terrible, but it just doesn't work.  There's a couple of reasons why. <br /> <br />First, there's Neil Gaimen.  He is a good writer, but his work lacks cohesion.  He throws out interesting concepts, but doesn't seem interested in following them through.  Mirrormask jumps around a lot.  Is it a coming of age story?  Is it an Alice in Wonderland journey into strangeness?  Is it an allegory?  Yes.  No.  Sometimes.  Some viewers, particularly Gaimen fans, will argue that the film's strength is that it doesn't fit any particular category.  True, there are some films that transcend genre.  Mirrormask isn't one of them for me because it still must have a satisfying story, and this is where the film falls flat. <br /> <br />The conflict of Mirrormask is never clear, hence never clearly resolved.  Our heroine starts the film with legitimate complaints about being basically enslaved into the circus by her parents.  She wants a normal life.  More importantly, she wants a choice, and I could clearly empathise with that.  But soon enough, this idea is discarded. <br /> <br />Fair enough, but once in the mirrorworld, we are given a creation myth which makes this otherworld seem like a creation of the girl's imagination.  It's an interesting notion, but again, it's quickly thrown aside.  Again, I was willing to forgive. <br /> <br />As our heroine journeys through this otherworld, I began to suspect that she was actually journeying through her mother's mind, helping to cure her ill parent.  But nope, that is just as quickly dropped. <br /> <br />The other problem with Mirrormask comes fromo Jim Henson Productions.  For such a lively and wonderful company, this film is visually flat and uninspired.  The lack of color or appealing characters (both visually and personality) makes the film a chore to sit through. <br /> <br />Of course, Gaimen's fans will disagree.  Maybe Ijust don't get it.  Or maybe there's nothing to get.  MY RECOMMENDATION:  Skip this movie and watch Labyrinth instead.

0375405380|5.0|Imagine the scope of \\"The Godfather,\\" \\"Once Upon A Time In The West,\\" a bunch of Steve McQueen movies and \\"The French Connection\\" rolled and recycled into an epic (imaginary) telling of the drug wars. The result would be \\"The Power Of The Dog,\\" a sprawling story covering two decades and three continents of the so-called War On Drugs.<br /><br />  Don Winslow is a master storyteller. Every page crackles with conspiracy, mayhem, murder, corruption and evil. The plotting is superb. The story begins in 1981 with sort-of-idealistic DEA agent Art Keller unwittingly aiding in the creation of the Federacion, a Mexican drug-dealing cartel. From that moment on Keller and the Barrera family will be linked in combat as friends and enemies.<br /><br />  Winslow's reach is breathtakintg. He writes of the internal politics of Mexico, the United States, Columbia and several other countries. He details the movement of drugs into the United States, describing the moves of the smugglers and the counter-moves of the DEA. The CIA, as an evil influence of course, rides throughout the story. The Mafia is there as well along with Marxist terror groups (\\"reformers,\\" of course), the various factions of the Roman Catholic Church and the young kids seduced by the instant wealth drug dealiing is supposed to bring.<br /><br />  It's a great story that, like \\"The Godfather,\\" takes your breath away.<br /><br />  But it's important as well to remember that \\"The Godfather,\\" as  the trials of numerous Mafiosa demonstrated, was very long on fiction and short on fact. The same may be true of \\"Dog.\\" Winslow is unremittingly anti-American. Everything wrong in the world is the fault of the United States. The United States sponsors the slaughter of innocent. The United States this, the United States that. For example, so-called \\"right-wing deathsquads\\" in Central and South American nations are attributed to the influence of the United States. Nothing significant is mentioned of the depradations of the left-wing, of the dead, kidnapped and terrorized.Could Winslow have written his story without defaming the United States? Sure.<br /><br />  Keller is the Everyman of the War On Drugs, something that many people view as a tremendous waste of resources. Keller is driven by his sometimes wavering dedication to the law (which Keller interprets as he sees fit) and a desire for revenge against the Barrera. Morally the younger Keller is a direct lift of the young Michael Correlone. Later, Keller morphs into Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name and Dirty Harry: a disillusioned idealist fighting for justice using the other side's rules.<br /><br />  Winslow does the job well. \\"Power Of The Dog\\" is great fiction that perhaps offers some insight into the War On Drugs. But I wouldn't read it as history.<br /><br />Jerryf the left-wing, of the dead, kidnapped and terrorized.Could Winslow have written his story without defaming the United States?

0375703764|5.0|House of Leaves begins with an exciting mixture of humor and intrigue. The reader really begins to wonder is this is truly a work of fiction being that the novel is written in such a way you are drawn into all aspects and layers of the book. This is by far one of the most creative and original novels I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Not only does Danielewski have a groundbreaking style, but the multiple stories that occur are fascinating as well. The most basic premise of the novel is a story of a family that moves into a house that appears to be growing from the inside, a blind man who has died, thus leaving the family's story behind, and a young man named Johnny Truant who discovers the text and is being deeply affected by the book as each chapter progresses. The plot is very intricate yet wonderful. To try and summarize it here would serve as a horrible injustice to the story. Occasionally, some sections drag, but it is worth continuing past them to get to the heart of the novel.  This may seem like the story line could be too complex, but those that truly love literature as an art form will be pleased and delighted.<br /><br />I was drawn in from page xi. That's right, page xi.<br /><br />Interesting note: Danielewski's sister is singer/songwriter Poe. Her second album, \\"Haunted\\" corresponds and was inspired by the novel. The CD is a must-have companion to the book.
0307276902|4.0|Given all the bad press James Frey received about this book, it is still a good read.  Sometimes it's hard to follow conversations in the book because quotes are never used - and the \\"F\\" bomb is used so insanely much that it's overkill.  If you can get past that, it's quite a journey to recovery to follow.
B000E1155E|5.0|Not since the release of\\"Definitely Maybe\\" has their been as much anticipation for a debut record as their is for Arctic Monkeys' \\"Whatever People Say I Am Thats What I Am Not.\\"  With all the hype and anticipation, its easy for the record to not live up to expectations, not this one.  The record throws out bruiser after bruiser, and each one never sounds the same as its predecessor.  All the songs have the typical British influences (Beatles excitement, Kinks cleverness, Oasis energy, and a thick Northern accent.)  The highlights of the record include the riotous \\"Fake Tales of San Francisco\\", the surprise epic \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor\\", and the monumental closer \\"A Certain Romance.\\"  Check this record out, its worth the buy. Classic. *****

They were actually quiet and enjoyed this very spirited drum and fiddle playing tune.
B00005V0X5|5.0|this is one of the best thrash/speed metal albums of all time its a great debut from one of the greatest and talented bands of all time. this is just the start before the classic Peace Sells but this is some of the lyrics and guitar i have ever heard. dave mustaine and chris poland play great together  <br />best songs; Last Rites/Loved to Deth (my favorite megadeth song)Killing is my business rattlehead skull beneath the skin and basically ever song on the album
0440180295|5.0|Vonnegut's suberb 1960's antiwar fantasy based upon his experiences as a POW held by the Germans during the Anglo American firebombing of the \\"Open City\\"(no military targets) Dresden in 1945 seen by many as a revenge bombing for the destruction of Coventry by the Luftwaffe.  *spoilers*        The story is the unconventional tale of Billy Pilgrim who as a result of being kidnapped by aliens has become unstuck in time and travels back and forth between events in his life from childhood to his death at the hands of a madman.    Though it drifts back and forth I've always found the story to be rather linear in nature and easy to follow.  The parts of the narrative related to Billy's experiece in the War are the most griping.  Especially the description of the death and destruction as POW's are enlisted to search for bodies and clear debris in the aftermath of the Fire Bombing of Dresden where more people died than in either Hiroshima or Nakasaki.  One is shot for basically \\"looting\\" a knick knack.    The story holds up quite well for being nearly 40 years old.  Vonnegut's works will probably gain a new following due to the current War and the state of things today.
B0002EXH54|5.0|This probably the best megadeth album of all time and one of my favorite albums of all time period. This is packed w/ crazy brutal lyrics and of course awesome solos and riffs by mustaine and poland. Guitar playing on every megadeth album is good except risk and its all original good sounding material. When i say megadeth at their best i mean it. Every song on the album is good, you could just put the cd in and listen to every song and rock out. Best Album by the Best Band
B00005JNRE|4.0|So many were comparing \\"Nanny McPhee\\" to Julie Andrews' prim and elegant Mary Poppins that I expected little more than a garish ripoff.  I was wrong.  Emma Thompson's \\"Nanny McPhee\\" is refreshingly charming.  What could have been a frothy confection of a movie is pulled together into a lovely fairy tale by Thompson's and the director's attention to detail: the use of color, Nanny McPhee's increasing beauty, the children's distinct personalities, etc.  Thompson, Colin Firth, Kelly MacDonald (Evangeline), and Angela Lansbury (Aunt Adelaide) give touching and hilarious performances.  Not the best movie of the year, of course, but certainly a brilliant little story worth a rental and perhaps a buy.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This is most musical megadeth album w/ even more solos and fast riffs. This is music in general is unbelievable. Mustaine and Friedmen steal the show w/ Nick Menza who is an unbelievable drummer. Its not as thrash as PSBWB or KIMB but its a different sound but possibly the best sound of megadeth Just pick it up  <br />you wont be dissapointed  <br />best songs= Holy wars hangar 18 take no prisoners and more <br />
B000E0WJIC|5.0|It seems like it took forever to get this album out to the public, especially in the U.S. Bullet for my Valentine combines emotion, anger and fear in both their lyrics and music. This cd has a little bit of everything for all listeners. I hate when reviews compare bands to other bands, but it seems like one would have to for this album. So here it goes... take Funeral for a Friend - \\"Casually Dressed and...\\" , Sepultura - \\"Roots\\" , and Deftones - \\"Adrenaline\\", combine them into one and you've got Bullet for my Valentine. This band respects the old school while delivering enough new school scream-o to keep the emo kids happy. Overall, fantastic album that's well produced and displays great talent all around. If you've broken up with a significant other, had someone breathing down your neck, send them this album and tell them these four words... \\"Look at me NOW!\\"
B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite for destruction is one of the greatest metal albums of all time. axl has the voice like no other and writes classics here like welcome to the jungle and sweet child o mine. slash is one of the greatest guitarist of all time his playin is unbelievable and really shows on this album. GNR at their best before they got soft but this is fast and hard
B000006OBQ|5.0|This is probably Frank Sinatra's finest album or rates in the top five. He is at his peak ,live with Count Basie. A must for Sinatra fans and music lovers generally.
B000E8N690|5.0|once in a while a great story melds with career-defining performances and you have the stuff of greatness. such is the case with Walk the Line, the story of Johnny Cash's early years and pursuit of June Carter. <br /> <br />as good a love story as there is on film, and all the more powerful because it is true. first, there's the material itself, for which we must thank june and johnny cash. secondly, there is jaquim phoenix's brooding, intense version of the man in black, a performance that recalled for me early james dean. equally powerful is reese witherspoon's portrayal of the strong, spirited and complex June Carter. add in the music itself and, as they say, the rest is history.
B000301YY8|5.0|I have never written a review for a musical artist before however i listen to music almost all day, everyday.  Recently i came across the James Blunt CD.  DAMN!  This CD is amazing.  I caught the \\"beautiful\\" song on the radio so i purchased the CD on itunes.  I was pleasently suprised when i sat back at my desk at work, listened to the CD and never got bored with any of the song.<br /><br />No Bravery is a powerful song that really made me think about how the world runs.<br /><br />Beautiful is such a fun song to listen to.<br /><br />Goodbye, My lover is probably the most heartfelt song i have listened to in a really long time.  This song knocked me out.  I was listening to the song and by the chorus i had to sit back in my chair and stopped working just to listen to this song.  By the of it, i was nearly in tears.  Its a great song, i dont care what anyone else says.  If this song doesn't get played on the radio its a crying shame, if it does, i guarantee it hits number 1!<br /><br />Check this CD out.  If you are a fan of John Mayer, David Grey, maybe even Jack Johnson, then you will probably enjoy this guys style.<br /><br />Eric
0684824906|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. One of the best aspects of the book is it dispels the notion that Lincoln suffered significantly from depression.  He lived in very difficult times, and often was sad, but his story and joke telling in the face of tremendous adversity indicates a healthy mental state.  Only a person of tremendous confidence could surround himself with the \\"best and the brightest\\" of his times.  Ms. Kearns has always been a pleasure to watch when commenting on current presidential events.  Her writing tells you why.  I read the book slowly, it took about two months, not because it was ponderous, but because it was so full of amazing anecdotes about the people who saved our country and put it on track to fulfill the promise of the Declaration of Independence.  These people are why the United States remains the best hope for mankind, and Ms. Kearns lets us get to know them well.
014028902X|5.0|I must say this is one of the most light-hearted, hilarious books I have ever read. The story is of a world that one really may not get to see these days.. Go ahead and buy it..
B0000639FE|5.0|This is the ultimate Tom Cruise performance, Crowe delivers the perfect screenplay and I just know this had to be written with Cruise in mind.  I love the scene where Cruise is at his lowest and he tells Gooding that he is cloked in failure, it is hilarious and nobody could have done it with such aplomb.  This movie also made Zellweger a star, and she is wonderful in this film.  Gooding won a deserved Oscar, but it is Cruise that gives the great performance, he makes you believe the conversion the character undergoes, when someday Cruise gets his lifetime achievement award, this will be pointed to as the quintesential Tom Cruise performance..the DVD has some nice extra's and the soundtrack, as is typical of Cameron Crowe, is great.  This is a great movie, and it improves with each viewing...oh and the kid steals every scene he is in.
0670034711|5.0|This is a magnificent story.  Thank you Ms. Gilbert for sharing a year of your life with me.  I read it in a day, and feel that I will be reading it again and again. Thank you.
B0000B1OFL|3.0|F. Gary Gray's \\"The Italian Job\\" (2003) is a glossy, pretty update of an earlier movie.  If \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" hadn't been exquisitely remade in 2001 by Steven Soderbergh, George Clooney, and assorted other stars, \\"The Italian Job\\" might have been able to stand on its own two feet.  Unfortunately, it looks like a poor knock-off job where Mark Wahlberg unsuccessfully tries to be another Danny Ocean, but lacks the gravitas of either Clooney or the original Ocean, Frank Sinatra.    One thing about this movie is undeniable, and that is that it looks great.  From the opening scenes of a clever heist in Venice to a double-cross on a chilly Alpine dam to a car chase through L.A. to the glorious lines of Charlize Theron's face, \\"The Italian Job\\" is one of the best-looking crime movies you'll ever see.  Unfortunately, beauty carries a movie only so far - \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" is another movie that looks uber-gorgeous, but nobody's going to eagerly await the 10th-anniversary edition of that DVD, are they?    Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, who starts the film as the heir apparent to the role of leader of a gang of lovable thieves, now that former leader John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) is stepping down.  Croker leads his team through the successful \\"Italian job,\\" which is a clever heist involving swiping a huge safe from a Venetian mansion using explosives, scuba gear, and a very fast boat.      But in a plot twist that the promotional ads gave away, the Italian Job goes bad when Steve (Ed Norton) double-crosses the team and leaves them for dead, swiping $35 million in gold ingots.  (As an aside, is \\"Steve\\" really the name you want for your villain?  If the filmmakers were trying to make a comic point here, perhaps using the blandness of Steve to point out the over-the-top names of many movie villains, they were a bit too subtle.  Instead, \\"Steve\\" comes off like a first-draft name that they simply forgot to revisit.)    Some time later, Croker and team track down Steve inL.A. and plan for a caper that would both bring back the millions they lost to Steve as well as a certain measure of vengeance.  To do this, they need a safe-cracker, and wouldn't you know it, the late Mr. Bridger left a lovely daughter Stella (the aforementioned Ms. Theron), who is a safe-cracker who works for the police when she isn't racking up speeding tickets.  But where dear old dad \\"worked by instinct,\\" Stella uses the best in modern technology to get the job done.  With that set-up, would you be surprised if there is a scene where Stella has to abandon her hi-tech gadgetry and crack a safe using nothing but her \\"instincts\\"?  If you would be surprised by such a plot development, \\"The Italian Job\\" is probably going to be one of your favorite movies.      And this is ultimately where \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" sinks \\"The Italian Job.\\"  Both movies cover essentially the same ground (planning an incredibly complex and witty heist), but \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" does this so much better.  Both films involve teams of lovable criminals, but while you can't criticize Jason Statham, Mos Def, and Seth Greene of \\"Italian Job,\\" this ensemble can't hold a candle to \\"Ocean's Eleven's\\" \\"supporting cast\\" of Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mack, Carl Reiner, and others.  I enjoy Ms. Theron's performance much more than Julia Roberts' turn in \\"Ocean's Eleven,\\" but it must be said that as far as the female leads are concerned, there are no losers here.      Both films also spend a lot of time focusing on the intricate planning that goes into a major caper, but again \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" has a caper that is rich with surprise, wit, and humor.  The climactic heist in \\"The Italian Job\\" builds to, of all things, a car chase.  Sure, it's an amazing car chase, but if your movie is focusing on wit and humor, relying on a car chase to pull off the climax is a signal that the writers have given up.      And finally, as much as I enjoy Ed Norton as an actor, you have to admit that his villain, Steve, can't hold acandle to the ominous refinement brought to the screen by Andy Garcia as Terry Benedict in \\"Ocean's Eleven.\\"  Garcia injects such slick venom into his scenes that otherwise throwaway lines like his \\"Terry\\" - \\"Danny\\" exchange with Clooney take on a whole new life.  Ed Norton is a wonderful actor, but Steve just ain't that much of a bad guy -- he's so unoriginal that he spends his ill-gotten gains on the prizes that his other fellow criminals planned to purchase.  Translation -- Steve is an empty box, and empty boxes do not great villains make.    Perhaps I'm getting long-winded for a three-star review.  I must confess I had high expectations for \\"The Italian Job.\\"  But at the end of the day, all Wahlberg and crew (with the exception of Charlize Theron) did was make me want to go watch a better crime movie.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Starts out with a roar, gets a little long in the tooth the second half.  Asks a lot of questions that should have been answered.
0793518326|2.0|This is pretty much what it claims to be, a treasure trove containing the complete scores of every last Beatles song one can think of.  I have perfect vision, yet the print is so small that I cannot read it on the music rest of a piano or on a stand while playing a guitar.  To put this in perspective, it hurts to read it even with your face six inches away!  This severe shortcoming undermines the basic logic of why one would purchase this book to begin with.  If you were to enlarge the notation and text to normal size on a copy machine, then this book could still prove to be a valuable resource. The process of photocopying, however, is nearly as time consuming as just finding a tab or lyrics for free from a multitude of internet sites.  Though I will play many songs contained in this volume, some imbecile at the publishing company has produced what is an expensive object sure to frustrate and anger in its illegible presentation. In my opinion, it's an absolute waste of a tree unless its pretty white cover provides some sort of ego gratification from atop the bookshelf.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|BELIEVE<br /><br />The Polar Express is one of those feel good films that Disney use to do long ago and someone needed to do it. This  simple story about a special train taking a group of children to the North Pole to meet Santa before magical ride.<br /><br />The roto-scope process of  animation gives this holiday video such a magical feel especially in the widescreen process. You can see why the film was on the IMAX screen.  This Half human/half cartoon-ish effect gives this film like a timeless classic. The effects are stunning, the cinematic ride is stunning and overwhelming in  visual department and amazing in its scope and range.<br /><br />Tom Hanks dons many verbal character hats in this production, including  the all knowing conductor and SANTA.<br /><br />There is simple message that flows in this film, that makes this film morer than a Christmas favorite. Disney use to have that, but not anymore-its that simple charm with no pretention nor preachiness.  It  should be shown with your favorite Christmas holiday classics  like White Christmas, Holiday Inn How the Grinch that Stole Christmas (cartoon not film),Frosty the Snowman, An American Christmas Carol (with Henry Winkler),  Santa Claus is Coming to Town and Die Hard (well everyone has a guilty holiday pleasure)<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD
B000BTJCRM|5.0|Ok, I just got back from Perth's Big Day Out. I was there to see Iggy and the Stooges, but some enthusiastic surffer boys commanded me to go see Wolfmother. So I did (Iggy too), and I was blown away!! This disc is classic rock. Crunch power chords mixed with progressive rock concepts and wonderful pop harmonies, and spine tingling vocal acrobatics.  Minds Eye starts out sounding like Radiohead, then morphs into some classic power rock from a by-gone era.  Dimensions is pure hard rock candy.  It is hard to believe this is a threesome generating so much hard core sound.  GET IT! You'll love it!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I happened to be watching a movie late one night when I heard Johnny Cash sing The Man  Comes Around and he had Sung a song by Bob Dylan - Hiway 61 Revisited. I was totally surprised and overwhelmed by those songs and reall didn\\"t pay much attention on trying to buy it until, one day a great friend and I were coming back from a fishing trip and he had the cd and played it and I asked him what the name was and he said The Man Comes Around , so I purchased it and listen to it alot.
B000E1155E|4.0|I've been listening to Rock music since I was a little kid in the 60s and came of age during the 80s L.A. rock explosion.  This is the best rock album of the last several years.  It rocks hard, but intelligently.  The lyrics are great.  The playing is great and passionate.  The musical ideas are broad and serious.  They sound like NOW! not some copy of the past.  The only problem will be all the bands copying elements of their style.  I recommend the album.  It's not perfect, so I can't give it a 5.  \\"Double Nickels on the Dime\\" by Minutement is perfect.  \\"Giant Steps\\" by the Boo Radleys is perfect.  But those weren't their first albums.  I bet that the Arctic Monkeys have a lot of growing their going to do and that their next albums will also be great.
0596000480|4.0|I have had this book for years.  I really like this book a lot.<br /><br />It teaches you the language.  It is a good reference for the syntax of Javascript 1.5. It also does a decent job of teaching DHTML.  Some foreknowledge of HTML is going to be helpful.  That can easily be gained from other books, reading the spec, or going through some of the HTML tutorials on the web.  This book tells you how to access the structure of an HTML document - and change it.<br /><br />Amazingly, it really did not start to become obsolete for almost half a decade.  For a computer book on a heavily used computer language, that is great.<br /><br />In late 2005, Mozilla released Firefox 1.5 which included a new version of Javascript:  Javascript 1.6.  Unlike some updates, this one was a doozy.<br /><br />Javascript 1.6 introduced a feature called E4X - Ecmascript for Java.  This powerful feature actually upgrades the language, making XML fragments a first class data type.<br /><br />What this means is two things:<br /><br />First, you can put XML fragments in your program.  Just as quoted strings are interpreted as string literals, these fragments are treated as XML literals.  No quoting or anything is required: the parser just sees them and knows what they are.<br /><br />Second, you can evaluate XPath-like expressions to find things in an XML fragment value. Those things would be attribute values, text content, and elements that are in it.<br /><br />Today, XML is much more important to organizations and much more useful to programmers than it was in 2001.  It is a given that easier, more powerful ways for programmers to work with XML are going to grab programmers' interest.<br /><br />Another thing has changed since 2001.  AJAX programming has become white-hot.  Website users like it because the system seems more responsive.  Programmers like it because it lets them create web sites that seem more fun and are more impressive to a generation numbed-out by constant fill-in-form/Submit cycle of web pages.  Companies like it because it AJAX is \\"in\\" and having it on their site can draw people to it by word of mouth or as marketable feature.<br /><br />AJAX programming relies on the XMLHttpRequest object.  That is not described in this book.  Consequently AJAX programming is not explained in it.<br /><br />A lot of AJAX components & effects libraries; e.g. Prototype.js, scriptaculous (script.aculo.us if you are looking for it on the web), etc., were in high gear by 2005.  Since the book came out years before that, it does not mention any of these, tell what they can do, or explain how to write programs that use them.<br /><br />Two other standards got added to Firefox 1.5 when it was released in 2005:  SVG content and the CANVAS element. While CANVAS is a new invention, it is already supported by Apple's Safari 2 web browser that came with Tiger, released in early 2005.  SVG is a very mature standard, invented in the late 1990s - but not really included in a widely distributed piece of software until Firefox included it.  From watching what is going on in Apple's Safari development site, it seems likely Safari will gain SVG support sometime in 2006.<br /><br />These 2 graphics capabilities are both important.<br /><br />The CANVAS element is perfect for realtime and/or interactive graphics.  For instance, it would be great for a \\"paint\\" program or a constantly-updated graph/chart display.<br /><br />The SVG content is XML.  The elements describe how to draw some shapes and text, fill them in, draw the borders, and perform transformations on them - as well as fancy effects like \\"shear\\". The power of SVG is huge.  It can be used to draw all of the things described, plus more advanced things like \\"quadratic bezier curves\\".  This makes it also suited to render art objects or sophisticated two-dimensional visualizations.<br /><br />Now, go back to what is in the 4th edition of the book.  The coverage of the different types of objects is covered in different sections - based on what the objects are used for.  This is fine, but then there needs to be a special alphabetized index as well as detailed table of contents that shows you where to find each one - and what is in each section.  Reading the whole book is not an option when you are in a hurry.  When you are doing stuff on the web, you are always in a hurry.  So, ways to find things quickly and survey quickly what is there - that is crucial.<br /><br />I think a 5th edition of this book could be phenomenal, if it takes care of the omissions I have cited.  Even in its present form, it does a good job of teaching the language - with the exception of the missing items I have noted.es of objects is covered in different sections - based on what the objects are used for.

0684135051|5.0|I purchased this book through Amazon without ever having seen the book or leafed through it in-person.  When it arrived at my door, I eagerly opened the cover and flipped through the pages with giddy anticipation.  I am a passionate knitter, I've knit since before I could read, but this was my first time owning a book by the famed and revered Elizabeth Zimmermann.  But my initial response? Sadly disappointed!  Afterall, where were the bright glossy photos and the fun, bold typesetting found in the garden-variety of knitting books today?  What I found was pages and pages of continuous text.  Well, it is a book afterall.<br /><br />My curiousity got the best of me, later that night I found myself curled up in bed reading the book.  My initial response of disappointment could not have been further from the truth!  After immersing myself into just a few pages, I felt like I had sat down to knit with an old friend.  Zimmermann's candid and frank writing style brought me a smile and more than a knowing laugh or two as she shares her knitting wisdom.  Yet, there is a sophistication to her writing that leaves the reader drawn into the pages, finding each new tip or bit of advice as something to savor.<br /><br />Even the rudimentary skills of knitting come into new light within her chatty, and sometimes unabashedly opinionated, pages.  I loved and applauded her stern lecture on the importance of gauge. (Yes, an entire chapter all its own, and rightly so!) Gauge is the golden key to the door of knitting design.  Yet it is something so often overlooked by new or impatient knitters, and often with ghastly, disappointing results.<br /><br />Step by step in a narrative, familiar style, she covers the tools of the knitting trade, needles, yarns, skills, and of course, her passion for knitting.  All given with tidbits of enlightment even for the experienced knitter. Then gently, she takes the reader to a new path of creativity with clear guidance and instructions to explore nearly endless options of pattern and design.  She does this by laying a simply, methodical ground work for the form and shape of any sweater.  You can then take that skeletal form and emboss it to your heart's content with your own stitches, designs, color work, originality, and style.  I have fallen even more in love with circular after reading this book, and I find the seamless, ease of style, even more liberating.<br /><br />The focus is on sweater design, but really, you can take these skills to any facet of your knitting. She even covers a sampling of other projects, hats, mittens, afghans, even skirts!  I found the details of what makes a sweater into a coat interesting.  The section entitled \\"A Few Remarks on Socks\\" makes the book worth its price alone!  The photos and details of just different knitted heel types were fascinating and most helpful.  The \\"few remarks\\" are actually a few pages of detailed, fool-proof instruction which I fould both instructional and inspiring for sock knitting.<br /><br />What can I say, I LOVED the book.  I found it a necessary jewel for any knitter's library.  I'd suggest that very new beginners to knitting will want to learn to cast on, knit and purl comfortably before digging into this treasure of a find.  Once you have those basics down, however, do dive into this book with glee!<br /><br />As stated by the author herself, \\"Really, all you need to become a good knitter is common sense...of course superior intelligence, such as yours and mine, is an advantage.\\"  And that is Elizabeth Zimmermann for you!endless options of pattern and design.

B000002AH9|5.0|The first time I heard the distinctive timbre of Billie Holiday's immortal voice which somehow speaks to us from the deepest haunts of the soul, I believe I was somewhere in the vicinity of my mother's apron strings, and remember her remarking to the effect, \\"Now, that's a tragedy - she was so great . . .  a mere shadow of what she was - terribly, terribly self-destructive\\", echoing the common sentiment.  Lady Day was still alive at that time.  And I remember the furl between the eyebrows of her original producer with Columbia, John Hammond Sr., when, some twenty years later, he recalled what is referred to on the copious liner notes of this awesome 1997 Sony reissue of the 1958 original as \\"the more lurid elements of the Billie Holiday saga\\".  And since her death 17 months after this recording, the discussion has raged around that curious question: \\"Who was greater (or, in our abstracted experience of the media, unfortunately, \\"which\\"), the early Lady, or the later?\\"  The early Billie - with her spectacular range, her unmatched phrasing, cadence, her youthful charm - adored by her sidemen and audiences alike - or the later - in her finest hour - on this recording - the heart-broken, broke, haggard, dispossessed junkie - in the words of her primary collaborator (by request) on this effort, Ray Ellis - \\" When we began recording and I heard the first playback, I was quite shook up.  The quality of Billie's voice had really deteriorated.  It was very noticeable to me after listening to all her early records\\".<br /><br />\\"Lady in Satin\\", one of the towering masterpieces of the genre (maybe THE masterpiece), should put that dispute to rest forever, but, undoubtedly, it won't.  Gone is the full body of Billie's voice, gone - any of the usual repertoire of her well-known classic titles which have since become cultural standards - too numerous to list ... well, you know them.  What is conveyed is something else, which today is curtly and rather tritely as referred to as \\" the ineffable\\".  The resiliency of the human spirit which will not be denied, even in the face of ultimate denial, perhaps . . . staring squarely into the crack of doom?  A frank and strangely satisfying discussion of the downside of love and desire?  Billie, who chose the repetoire,  in the brief time which remained to her, once called this palpably torturous session her \\"favorite\\" recording.  One wonders exactly what she meant.  Ray Ellis, a musician of stoic discipline, who could only have existed before the advent of the Beatles and after the gentrification of Kansas City, a maestro of what we today call `1950's musak', said: \\"After we finished the album, I went into the control room and listened to all the takes.  I must admit I was unhappy with her performance, but I was listening musically instead of emotionally.

And the refrain which seems to especially come to mind:  \\"Time and time again . . .\\"fable\\".  The resiliency of the human spirit which will not be denied, even in the face of ultimate denial, perhaps . . . staring squarely into the crack of doom?  A frank and strangely satisfying discussion of the downside of love and desire?  Billie, who chose the repetoire,  in the brief time which remained to her, once called this palpably torturous session her \\"favorite\\" recording.  One wonders exactly what she meant.  Ray Ellis, a musician of stoic discipline, who could only have existed before the advent of the Beatles and after the gentrification of Kansas City, a maestro of what we today call `1950's musak', said: \\"After we finished the album, I went into the control room and listened to all the takes.

B000055Y0X|5.0|5 Stars <br /> <br />Buy this movie and I can guarantee you it will not set on your shelf and get dusty. <br /> <br />This movie should be one of the top ten war movies of all time.  Why?  This movie correctly captures the feel of the late 1950s and early 1960s when there was a massive fleet of jet bombers which would attack the Soviet Union.   <br /> <br />Personally I thought that George C. Scott should have received a best supporting actor award.  There is a scene in the \\"War Room\\" where the president of the USA is giving the flight paths of the attacking bombers and the look on Scott's face was priceless.  George C. Scott, as General \\"Buck\\" Turgidson, is one of the funniest actors in this movie. <br /> <br />Colonel \\"Jack\\" Ripper, the insane commander of the SAC base that declares war on the Soviet Union, is clearly modelled on contemporary USAF commanders.  These idiots would run around saying the USA could win a first strike war on the Soviet Union.  Sheeze.  Russia lost over 20 million when Nazi German launched an attack.  Then Russia had to endure our generals.  The malevolent way that Colonel Ripper chews his cigar is enough to make a sane person to never seriously consider smoking. <br /> <br />The B-52 crew flying on station does capture the aircrew boredom of that period.  Jets would fly in lazy formations and their crews would do anything to keep from dying from boredom.  What the movie can't tell a viewer is while this duty was deathly boring it was deadly dangerous.  More than one aircraft and its thermonuclear weapon were lost on these flights.  However, I digress from the main point.  The movie correctly shows the men reading a Playboy to pass the time.  They were less politically correct back then. <br /> <br />When the attack orders come in they are greeted with initial skepticism.  \\"That the dumbest thing I've heard\\", roars Major \\"King\\" Kong played perfectly by Slim Pickens.   <br /> <br />The briefing on the \\"USAF survival packet\\" that is givenin the B-52 does correctly show the absolute insanity of that period.   <br /> <br />Peter Sellers gives a great performance in this movie.  He has three parts.  However, his best movie part is of the ex-Nazi war criminal \\"Dr Strangelove\\".  \\"Und Animals could be bread und SLAUGHTERED\\" Dr Strangeloves advises the President when talking about the post war survival options. <br /> <br />This movie is a classic.  It could be among the top ten war movies of all times but can't be because it's fiction, a dark comedy, and involves a non-existent nuclear war from the early 1960s.
B000002IAZ|5.0|'Retrospective', the Buffalo Springfield's single greatest hits album is one of those rare 'greatest hits' issues which acquires a life of its own, above and beyond the original recordings by an artist. The only other album I can think of with a similar life is The Mamas and the Papas' album, 'Farewell to the Last Golden Era'.<br /><br />Like The Blues Project, the Byrds, the Spenser Davis Group and the Yardbirds, Buffalo Springfield is most famous for being the first band for several major musical talents, primarily Neil Young and Stephen Stills.<br /><br />To my mind, unlike the careers of Steve Winwood, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and David Crosby, I find many of the songs on 'first band' album to be as good or better than many things either artist did in later ventures. Part of this is probably due to the fact that unlike millions of other people who developed a taste for Neil Young in the '60s, I never developed a fondness for his odd singing style. But then I never was big on Jimi Hendrix either. So go figure.<br /><br />For those of us who came of age in the '60s, this is an absolutely must have album.
078681859X|4.0|This features a lonely 12-year-old boy-wizard growing up in a sort-of alternate-reality London.  It naturally invites comparison to Harry Potter, but the treatment is original enough that comparison dissipates.<br /><br />One major difference is that in this world, magical power is parasitic.  Magicians gain power (magical and political) almost exclusively by enslaving and oppressing other beings:  The magicians learn to hate and despise their slaves, which include not only common humans, but the summoned genies (called \\"demons\\") which are the major source of their power.<br /><br />The story documents the tense relationship between Nathaniel (a 12-year old wizard prodigy) and Bartimaeus (a \\"demon\\"), whom Nathaniel has summoned to do his bidding in a petty quest for revenge.  Bartimaeus hates magicians and would much rather tear Nathaniel limb-from-limb than obey him.  Since the proud, cruel, power-hungry Nathaniel resembles a young Lord Voldemort as much, if not more, than he resembles a young Harry Potter, we half see the demon's point.  On the other hand, he's just a lonely kid, and Stroud does a pretty good job of making us at least feel sorry for him.<br /><br />The story flows smoothly, except in spots where the magical action sequences and wizardly intrigue seem labored and clunky.  Rowling can still do these things better than Stroud can.<br /><br />Neither the boy nor the demon are particularly admirable.  This did not bother me since it seems neither hero speaks with the author's voice.  The characters may be a bit immoral, but (I think) the story is not.
B000BYA5G4|4.0|`Lord of War', written and directed by Andrew Niccol, starring (and co-produced by) Nicolas Cage is a slightly better than average Nicholas Cage vehicle which at least some reviewers represented among the blurbs on the cover seem to misuderstand. At least two blurbs describe the film as a `thriller', but it is definitely not a `thriller' in any normal sense of the term. My best description of the nature of the movie may be a `biopic' based on a parody of a `New Yorker' profile of a fictional arms dealer.<br /><br />The movie is much more about motives, personality, and development of the Cage character, a Ukranian emigrant to `little Odessa' in Brooklyn who develops his `shady' to illegal arms trade from selling Uzi's to mercenaries to selling tanks and attack helicopters to African insurgents and strong men. The flick is not a thriller because aside from a few short incidents, there is never any enduring threat to the principle characters or any great mystery about Cage's character or his enterprises. By comparison, the great thriller, `The Usual Suspects' creates a big puzzle from the very beginning which grows with developments until it is resolved only in the very last scene. Nothing like that is going on here. There is even very little mystery or suspense over whether Cage's character will succeed with his romantic campaign.<br /><br />This movie is all about the principle character's morality, the morality, or more accurately the strong legal sense of his antagonist, the Interpol agent played by Ethan Hawke, and the advice the principle gets from veteran arms dealer played by Ian Holm, and the consequences of following Holm's advice.<br /><br />This movie is not quite as engaging as Cages's best flicks, such as `Adaptation', `Matchstick Man', or even the action movie `Con Air'. But, it is a whole lot better than some of Cage's stinkers such as `War Birds'.<br /><br />Actully, one of the most interesting things about the movie is what we learn about the illegal weapons trade and how it was affected by the end of the cold war. One almost expects these types of characters to be either outright scoundrels or inept. Cage is neither. He succeeds in escaping from the dual perils of the law and his unsavory customers.<br /><br />Unlike `Con Air' and even `Adaptation', this movie suffers a bit from the rather light cast. There is no one like  John Malkovich against which he can play.<br /><br />All in all, this is still a worthwhile movie, although the DVD extras are remarkably slim, probably because there is another 2 disk version, of course, for a higher price!illegal weapons trade and how it was affected by the end of the cold war.

B000002I6T|5.0|...and he only had one complete album. And what an album it is. There's a certain sound that had a life of it's own and Crosby was its epicenter. It can be heard on Paul Kantner's \\"Blows Against the Empire\\", the Grateful Dead's \\"Europe '72\\", and, more than anywhere else, here on this album.  <br /> <br />From \\"Music is Love\\" to \\"I Could Swear Ther was Somebody Here\\", Crosby weaves some serious hippie magic here. And, if you think that the word \\"hippie\\" somehow diminshes the overall result, you need a bit of an attitude readjustment. It's late in the \\"movement\\", paranoia and fatigue have killed off most of the body's cells, but those that remained have given it one last, killer go.  <br /> <br />Music is love, indeed.  <br /> <br />
B000055Y0X|5.0|This is a must see for any of the active politial minded folks out there. The reveals tell the bottom line (perhaps the truth) of most any recent govt. administration with worries. The fact that when Pres. Nixon asked where the war room was when he came into office, (in fact it did not exist) tells how believable and serious this tale really is. AND, how our bureaucrats deal with/or are influenced by their actions (and the influenece of nut cases)because of 'un/dis information'. Go figure...
0316172324|3.0|Blink is an extremely interesting read, no more and no less. It is not a textbook, nor is it a self-help book. Do not expect any solutions or unified theory here. The basic premise is that the unconscious mind can and often does make critical decisions that are difficult to rationally parse on first analysis and that can often be superior to logical and reasoned decisions based on a plethora of information. Gladwell starts off with gusto, making the reader think he is going to tie-in all the various threads into a coherent theory and prescription shortly. Somewhere along the way however, he seems to realise just how insurmountable an objective this is and from then on, the book just coasts along. As a review of human behavior however, Blink is excellent. Gladwell is particularly good at describing in clear and engaging terms a situation or experiment, telling us the story in an interest-arousing manner, and then identifying the lessons to be learned. A reader can gain some very good insights into human behavior, yet be left somewhat unsure exactly how to apply these insights. Sure, some of the stuff appears in hindsight to be plain common sense; except that most people miss the common sense on first read. The statistics he quotes (e.g. height as a factor in CEOs, cardiac triage) are excellent food for thought. And the various anecdotes Gladwell cites are both entertaining as well as instructive. I have to admire Gladwell's ability to transform dry research into terms of human interest. A short, entertaining and informative read, which earns it 3 stars.

0307276902|2.0|A NOTE FROM THE REVIEWER: I read A Million Little Pieces and wrote a review I think author James Frey would like. When I went to the to post it, I noticed that Amazon will soon begin shipping copies of this book with a special note from the author and publisher, to explain and clarify some of what people have interpreted as inaccuracies in the book. In that same spirit, I have clarified some points in my review below in hopes that what I wrote will be more accurately understood. The new information appears in [brackets]. Thank you.<br /><br />A Million Little Pieces is a riveting memoir that aggressively grabs your attention, starting from the first page.<br /><br />[OK, well, what I meant to say here was that starting from the very beginning, the book stretches the limits of any intelligent readers' willing suspension of disbelief. It's not a book that starts strongly and goes awry at some point. It just starts awry.]<br /><br />The opening scene is unforgettable: dazed author James Frey awakes on a flight without knowing where he is, his clothes covered with \\"a colorful mixture of spit, snot, urine, vomit and blood,\\" with his four front teeth missing, and a bloody hole in his cheek. He is wanted by the police, addicted to drugs and alcohol, and his life on a dizzying downward spiral that seems like it can only lead to a pathetic and horrible death.<br /><br />[Um, how to do I put this? Maybe it isn't apparent just from reading it, but this paragraph was my way of saying that the little voice that during the opening sequence whispers into the readers' ear: \\"Is this supposed to be taken at face value?\\" will become a deafening chorus within a few dozen pages. Consider yourself warned.]<br /><br />Somehow, though, Mr. Frey heroically pulls out of his free-fall and miraculously transforms himself into someone who, one could convincingly argue, is indeed \\"the greatest literary writer of his generation\\" -- a goal he even states in the text.<br /><br />[Obviously, this is meant to point out how pedantic, clumsy, and stylistically unadventurous the writing is. In terms of story telling, Mr. Frey is a one-trick pony, simply shocking the reader at every turn: Blood! Guts! Urine! Bile! Spit! Snot! What I was trying to point out here, in case anyone missed it, is that he attempts to mask the shock strategy through what amounts to a distracting use of self-deprecation, unpredictable paragraph<br /><br />breaks, Random Capitalization, and an absence of quotation marks and paragraph indents. But I don't think he fools anyone with those ploys.]<br /><br />But none of it happens before he traverses what appears to be several of Dante's levels of hell: submitting himself to mind-blowing dental surgery without anesthesia (to fight the pain, he grips tennis balls so forcefully that he cracks his fingernails), undergoing what can only be described as a hellish detox experience, and surviving his relationships with a nefarious group of characters that include a mobster, a deranged crack addict, fallen boxing champion, and a diseased prostitute.<br /><br />[I guess some stickers could argue here that my point isn't clear enough, so I'll restate it: It's tough to imagine anything within Mr. Frey's power of imagination that doesn't happen to him. And that's precisely because all of this comes from Mr. Frey's imagination. Real life can serve up unexpected circumstances, but simply setting the imagination's dial to \\"shock\\" and then red-lining it for more than 400 pages can produce some predictable -- albeit unsettling -- results.]<br /><br />Words just can't do this inspiring true story justice.<br /><br />[\\"True story.\\" Get it?]<br /><br />Your brow will drip cold sweat and your hands will tremble as you realize you are powerless to resist turning the page to find out what horrible thing will happen to Mr. Frey next, all the while knowing that somehow, against all odds, he will live to pen this marvelous volume.<br /><br />[Did you notice how despiteall the horrifying situations Mr. Frey gets himself into, he always manages to maintain a certain above-the-Frey (sorry, fray -- I couldn't resist) nobility? This is what crime psychologists call a \\"hero syndrome,\\" and it's one of the ways police identify criminals who invent complicated alibis, because, subconsciously, they won't make up a story that makes them seem irredeemable. So what I meant to point out in the above paragraph was that I guess that in a way, this book is Mr. Frey's alibi against anyone who accuses him of wasting away 2001 and 2002. To them, he could almost plausibly insist, \\"I was writing my memoir!\\" And it would work, too, unless they cracked open the cover and starting reading.]<br /><br />You will not walk away from the experience of reading this unchanged.<br /><br />[I'll let this conclusion stand on its own.]rvelous volume.  <br /> <br />[Did you notice how despite all the horrifying situations Mr. Frey gets himself into, he always manages to maintain a certain above-the-Frey (sorry, fray -- I couldn't resist) nobility?

B000BTJDGC|4.0|GOOD: <br /> <br />A lot of this movie was good. The special effects and the acting was phenominal. Carpenter (Emily Rose) did a phenominal job twisting and it did look like she was really possessed, it almost convinced me! Linney did amamzing, and so was Wilksonson as Father Moore. It was a great plot, great suspense and horror. It really had me going. They were all great, except for something really did get me.  <br /> <br />BAD: <br /> <br />THIS IS MOVIE IS NOT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. THERE WAS NO EMILY ROSE, OR FATHER MOORE OR ANY OF THAT JUNK. Emily Rose is not who we believe she is. There was no Emily Rose. If you google: \\"Emily Rose Trial\\" or \\"Exorsism of Emily Rose\\" all it will bring up is this movie. What really happened is in 1975, in Germany there was a girl named Annelise Michel and she was the german \\"Emily Rose\\" persay. Most of the things you see in this film are about, oh...50% accuriate as to really happened. Annelise Michel claimed to also be possesed by an ancient priest who'd lived in the 16th century and \\"demon\\" named Adolph Hitler. <br /> <br />If you want to find out what really happened, go here: <br />[...] <br /> <br />GRADE: This movie was an A+ in my book, but now its just an A.
0375759174|5.0|This was a wonderful read.  This was a realistic, though satirical, work about a young girl who goes to Bath and is at first utterly out of place, and then finds her niche.  She makes some terrible friends at first because of her gullibility and innocence, but then falls in with some nicer people who appreciate her honesty and this same innocence.  Her friendships develop in realistic ways, first with Isabella, which quickly and unreasonably flares up.  Her friendship with Henry's sister begins more slowly but as a result is that much more lasting.  Henry is a very likable and witty character; the introduction to the text says that it is in some ways based on Austen herself.  He is also, however, not idealized completely.  Through her characters and their interaction, Austen shows us the pitfalls of English society in this time period, and also lightly mocks the dramatics and irrationality of gothic novels.  It is a nice commentary on literature of that time period, and a joy to read!

B000008HPE|4.0|Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83,I think they really came into their own, commercial and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consimante professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far much more bitter, cynical sense of humour.  In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is \\"Hip to be Square\\", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself.

How Streisand.  The book was somewhat amusing.  Not the message, just the book: HUGE fonts and ample margins were effectively employed to make a fortune cookie into a real book, hardcover and all.  Even had a glossy paper sleeve, just like the grown-up books.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|Best album to date! Yes, I was also depressed when I read the news about Head leaving the band. Korn has been my favorite band for a long time now and I think it was a blessing in disguise. Munky really stepped up. Everybody did on this album. Now you do have to have an open mind when listening to this album. I was scared at first and took me a little to get into it but after that I learned what a great album it is. This album is nothing like the other ones and has a totally different sound. I would say it kind of sounds like Untouchables but ten times better. If you like Korn what so ever, you should like this. Hard core fans might be dissapointed but oh well. There is nothing you can do about it.

0896594289|2.0|I heard about this unusual book several years ago.  It was written in 1981 by an Italian architect/artist.<br /><br />The Codex is phenomenal publication:  over 100 pages of hand-written nonsense language; and hundreds of nonsense drawings.  The drawings are not totallly  meaningless:  they have recognizable images (humans, clothing, birds, trees) but drawn in impossible situations and configurations.<br /><br />The book appears to be an encyclopedia from an earth that evolved in a parallel universe to our own.<br /><br />The author deserves credit for being so extraordinarily imaginative.<br /><br />But the book is not really attractive to me.  After skimming it once, I had no desire to open it again.  Why?<br /><br />First, the thousands of words of text (in a nonsense alphabet) cant be deciphered.  This is not a code: it is just illegible mumbo-jumbo.  Random characters spewed out of a random number generator.  Interesting to peruse for about 5 minutes, but then what?  If he had made it a code that could be deciphered, the book would be so much more involving.<br /><br />Second, the drawings are a bit disturbing.  When I first heard of the book, I imagined that the illustrations would be somewhat comical or thought-provoking.  When I finally borrowed the book from a library (too expensive to buy!) I was dissappointed:  the illustrations, overall, have a grotesque or repellant nature.  Not as extreme as, say, Bosch.  But the pictures are filled with mutilations, needles, dissections, masks, cannibalism, deformities (or what are considered deformities on our planet :-).  The unerlying sense of the pictures is clearly S&M or bondage:  lots of people tied down, or wrapped up, or pierced.  The book is certainly not the kind of thing you would show to a child.<br /><br />In summary:  it is an outstanding work of art, and clearly a huge effort went into it.  An extremely unique book (I'd recommend it to collectors looking for that unusual book that no one else has :-)  But it is very shallow.  Compare it with, say, Graeme Base's Eleventh Hour or Kit Williams boot without a name.  Those have genuine puzzles hidden in them that can provide enjoyment for weeks on end.

0307276902|4.0|At the moment I don't recall which elements of the book are \\"fiction,\\" nor do I care.  I don't know why the book could not have been published as fiction rather than as a memoire.  The writing was fresh and imaginative, though perhaps a little overdone at times.  During the first part of the book some of the episodes of the author's withdrawal symptoms became a little repetitious, though that may have added to the power of his story.  Unexpectedly, I found the book hard to put down.

B00005JNTX|4.0|As a major fan of Robert Rodriguez and a fan of Frank Miller, I think that I was expecting a bit more from Sin City. It's hard to know exactly WHAT I wanted more of, since the film is suffused with style and violence, cheap broads with hearts of gold and mugs who never got a fair shot.<br /><br />But for all the style the film oozes, its extremely stylized dialogue is sometimes hard for the film's cast to get out and sound plausible doing so -- this is particularly true of some of the lines placed in the mouths of the actresses.<br /><br />Still, the film is ruthlessly true to Miller's vision and is easily the most hard-boiled noir movie ever made.

0091801370|3.0|Fluke Kelso is in Moscow to attend a conference on the recently opened Soviet archives. He is a Oxford historian and Mr Harris's novel tells the story of four days in Kelso's life which starts one night when a former NKVD officer visits him in his hotel room. He claims to have been the bodyguard of Lavrenty Beria who was at the time the chief of the secret police just before Stalin's death. According to him, he witnessed Stalin's death when he had his fatal stroke and he also saw Beria steal his papers among which was a black notebook.<br /><br />The following day, Kelso decides to verify the man's story at the Lenin Library. At this point he doesn't know that his enquiry is the beginning of a breathless chase from Moscow to the port of Archangel located on the White Sea in order to unveil Stalin's last secret which has been hidden for nearly fifty years.<br /><br />Good suspense, plenty of action and an interesting historical background are qualities in this novel which place Robert Harris at the same level as writers like John Buchan, John LeCarr&eacute; and Len Deighton.

B000BMSTMS|5.0|The members of Korn definitely take us in a new direction with this CD.  Just as they did with their Untouchables CD, they went with a more industrial sound instead of the hard-core sounds from their prior CDs.  Fieldy's bass slapping has been pushed into the background while James \\"Munky\\" Shafer's guitar skills now come to the foreground more than ever.  It took me a little while to adjust to their new sound, but now I can't stop listening to this CD.  Some people aren't going to like their evolution to the \\"Other Side\\", but as a die hard fan I'm there... and I'll always follow Korn in whatever direction they decide to take. <br />

0786856297|5.0|As a special education teacher, I see so few books that can capture the imagination of students with learning difficulties, and therefore many of them never learn to love books and reading. That's why this book is so exciting. The Lightning Thief is absolutely a gem of a book for any kids going through those tough middle school years - it has adventure, suspense, and wicked humor, plus educational value about Greek mythology. The reader cares about the characters so much. Every young reader I know adores this book (and I did as well). I can't wait for the next Percy Jackson adventure in what is sure to become a classic series.

B0001WTUH6|5.0|Vampire movies are usually bad. This movie is not bad (for some people). If you can't mantain your belief that the situation is happening before your eyes then this is not a good movie. If you can manage to suspend your disbelief this movie is quite a treat. <br />  Underworld has some nice fight scenes and made full use of special effects for its time. The story is well thought out. Although so much of the world has to be explained as well it is amazing the story is as well done as it is. And in my opinion the acting worked well for the overall movie. <br />  The director added in a lot of sound effects that give the sequences more emotion. The moody music and loud sounds help gluing you to the screen. If it is available, this is definately a movie you want with surround sound and the volume a notch higher than you usually watch TV. This movie is great if you get pulled into it and laughably bad if you are sitting on the side lines pointing at strange visuals.
0312330537|5.0|\\"Shantaram\\" is one of those rare works that truly defies categorization: it's pure entertainment, yet full of philosophical rumination; utterly compassionate but laden with violence and torture; focused but spanning many years and dozens of characters. <br />  <br />The book took me back to adventure tales of my childhood -- Dumas, Kipling, \\"Indiana Jones\\" -- but magnified to adult scale.  It's the fastest 1,000 pages you'll ever read.  The richly drawn characters will stay with you for days and weeks -- Khader Khan, the don of the Bombay mafia council; Karla, Lin's femme fatale; Prabakhar, the joyful guide who leads Lin into a world he never imagined; Abdullah, the black-clad assassin. <br /> <br />Yes, there are the occasional moments of purple prose, philosophical digression, gratuitous description. \\"Shantaram\\" is not for the rarefied halls of literary analysis. Rather, this is one of the rarest animals in today's annoyingly intellectual scene -- the true epic, lived by its author and brought, unfiltered, into the world.  I challenge anyone to read it and not be thrilled, moved and delighted.
0525948023|5.0|I have read Eckhart Tolle's previous works and believe him to be one of the most important spiritual teachers of the 20th and 21st centuries. I had waited very patiently however for this book which he took most of last year to write because when someone of his caliber takes so much time to write a book about enlightenment and the ego you know it's got to be good. The title didn't grab me so much though as the content. This book in one fell swoop has given me more food for thought concerning who I am and who and what this personality is up to than any other spiritual book I've ever read. It's a sobering look at who I am and how devious the ego can be. It has helped me see many of my problems are due to my ego instead of it being all those others in my life. If you're ready to face yourself and who you are up to now you've come to the right place. This book will show you all your games and guises and help you get back to the real you underneath it all. It may be the best step on the most ultimate path we all must eventually take towards a New Earth and our true purpose in life.
B000E1155E|4.0|These are UK club/pub tunes and should be heard accordingly. Are they as great as The Beatles as one reviewer said? Oh my god no. But the lyrics are indisputably fun, the drum work is great and the occasional change-ups in the tunes give a live dynamic quality to most of the tracks. The band certainly deserves 4 stars for such a fun CD. The singer does not have the annoying high pitched voice that almost all male singers are singing with nowadays.     Note that their are about 10 demo tracks and B-sides (not on this CD) that are quite excellent that are floating around in the UK. Hard to find right now in the USA but the demo tracks really make a case for this band having actual talent.

Now I am very upset since the MGM movie Wizrd of oz has a 3 disc set, and other fantasy cult classics such as Legend, Dark Crystal, and Labyrinth have great extras.  Please other oz lovers, please sign my petiton and get my word out. I am counting on other oz fans for support. I have started a petition to send to the Disney corp. to come out with Return to Oz on special Edition DVD.  I ask for a little more from the Disneys version of the OZ world.

B000002OX7|5.0|Can the Who's best album be anything less than the best album of the 1970s? Anyway, it has my vote. \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" might be the best song rock song made since the Beatles broke up. A tour de force.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wow, love this show, can't say enough about it.  Characters are lovable and well-developed so you care when they're in peril...which is often...good fight scenes, humor, dialogue and acting and whatnot...theme song sticks in your head without getting old...I have a rather, eh, eclectic range of friends who all like the show so count on a wide appeal...anyway, if the thousands of positive reviews don't convince, rent the movie \\"Serenity\\" and judge for yourself before you buy.
0066620996|3.0|I love the success story case studies in this book.  These types of stories were always my favorite in school.  But let the buyer beware: this book is best for those who can not only appreciate a good success story, but also APPLY base principles to their own companies. <br /> <br />Often, this doesn't work so well for those who are lower on the totem pole.  Nothing against hearing about the best of the best.  But the most difficult challenge lies in understanding that these are the stories of what worked for these companies - not yours.  Each business must find very specific changes to make in order to truly move itself \\"from good to great.\\"

B00008PW2D|4.0|Yes, I agree with everyone who is upset at HBO / AOL / Time Warner for charging so much for this season.  It's a rip-off...no question.  (Let's not even start on the dividing of Season 6 into 2 parts!)   <br /> <br />But it's interesting to me to see how much anger about the price/value has spilled into vitriolic evaluations of this season.  To me, it was the first time in awhile that the characters moved in believable directions.  Samantha opened herself up to commitment and heartbreak...and in a way only Samantha could do!  Miranda dealt with motherhood and her VERY ambiguous feelings towards it.  I liked very much the way she went from barely paying attention to her baby to finding satisfaction in loving her child and caring for him (too bad she named him \\"Brady\\").  I also like the constant evolution of her feelings toward Steve.  Charlotte works on coming to terms with failure, not only of her marriage, but of her whole \\"game plan\\" for life...marrying a nice, well-off professional, have kids, etc.   <br /> <br />Carrie is always the problematic character.  Her treatment of the important men in her life, particularly Aidan, has made her a tough person to care about.  She's witty...no doubt, and it's always fascinating to see what horrific or wonderful outfit she'll be wearing next.  I was relieved to see so little of Big in this season.  I guess I'm the only one who always found their relationship lacking...they brought out the worst in each other more than they brought out the best.   <br /> <br />The season was made a little uncomfortable by Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy.  It forced her to wear some awful things, and the directors of the show still insisted on lots of full body shots of her.  I remember a shot in the season finale, during the wedding reception.  She's standing there, looking pensive, and for some reason, instead of a close up (or even medium close-up), we got a full shot, and the poor thing looked awful.  And she looks tired and overly madeup throughout the season.  It's not her fault...I'm thrilled she had a baby...but the shows producers (which include Parker, ironically) didn't do Parker or Carrie any favors. <br /> <br />But the season is packed with highlights.  The vibrating chair stuff is very funny.  The trip to Atlantic City was fun.  The entire season finale was a treat, with everyone perplexed at Nathan Lane's character. <br /> <br />And the acting and writing was superb as always.  All four leads did very well, and excellent support was offered all around (although I was disappointed that Molly Shannon and Amy Sedaris weren't given more to do as Carrie's publishers).  Candice Bergen was amusing, and Frances Sternhagen makes a brief but memorable appearance as Bunny.  I was glad to see Office Space's Ron Livingston, and look forward to his character's arch in Season 6. <br /> <br />So, if you don't want to spend full price on this set (I don't blame you) spring for used copies on Amazon or at online auction sites.  It's essential SEX... viewing!! <br />
0380789019|3.0|NEVERWHERE definitely is an example of Gaiman having some fun by creating a mirror world to our own with a literal translations of London's geography. There's an Old Baily, an Earl at Earl's Court, you get the idea. You'll get the idea significantly faster than Richard Mayhew, the protagonist, who takes well over half the book to become something more than a whining \\"poor me\\" character. Surrounded by the much more interesting citizens of the London underground our hero pales in comparison. It gets to the point that when Richard finally steps up and faces his fears, the reader will think \\"Finally !\\" <br />Gaiman is always good for a novel twist and fascinating characters, but this one has a predictable plot and takes far too long to get to the finish. Worth your time for the elements that make Gaiman such an intriguing writer, but not up to the level of his other work.
B00005JNJV|5.0|While not a comic book fan, I did enjoy the Tim Burton Batman films. However, this new take on the Batman legacy is by far my favorite. It rates near the top with Spider-Man 2 as my all-time favorite super-hero films. <br /> <br />The characters were human and the relationships genuine. The chemistry of the cast is fantastic (though I have a hard time thinking of a film I didn't like with Morgan Freeman or Michael Caine). Hollywood cliches are deftly avoided and the \\"love interest\\" story line rode the fine line between being the focus of the film and avoiding the irrelevant fluff often seen in action films. <br /> <br />This was one of the few films in the past few years that was on my \\"must have\\" list.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|The sound track is an awesome collection if you really enjoyed the movie and loved the story. I used not to like some of the faster-paced songs in the album, like Devil's right hand, but after listening to it time and time again, I like anyone in it right now. It's a great mixture of the original blue gitar scores from Gustavo Santaolalla and those classic country music. The collection corresponds to the plot development of the movie so well that by listening to it I just revisit the story in my mind again.  Really loved it. <br /> <br />BTW, I got the CD the second day from Amazon during my prime membership trial. Exceptional experience.
0792843584|4.0|Great period movie about a little known time and place in American history.
B000002KO1|5.0|An album that has, ever since release, recieved a great deal of praise and all of it has been waranted. The sound was there and the time was right. Things, simply put, just clicked within the band for this short period of time. All of the songs have redeeming value and they all sound fresh. Now take all of that and cont in that this was a DEBUT album? That is beyond mind blowing. Of course there is a double edged sword there and the immediate fame can most certainly be attributed to the quick demise of the band. Perhaps it was best left this way though as the music remains. My personal favorite has to be \\"Stop Your Sobbing\\" or the radio favorite \\"Brass in Pocket\\", both of which are just part of an album full of gems.
B000066C6Z|3.0|Val Kilmer is really good at humiliating in the movie. And His way of being on top of a comedy of this movie. A great move to show your frends that havent laught in a wile. You nead to see it:)
B000002VBY|4.0|Krokus had released three albums prior to Headhunter, all of which are madly impossible to pick up without having to import them. Luckily I was able to pick up all three at a record store not long ago and I can say that all three of this albums get increasingly better. A sound was being developed. That sound was perfected with Headhunter and it is amazing this band did not become more popular for it. Headhunter is a straight hard rock album with great hooks and no gimmicks. You know what you are getting with Krokus much like with the band that clearly influenced Krokus the greatest, AC/DC. Clearly one of the better hard rock albums of the earl 80's but it remains fact that since there is no great substance, I can not give five stars. There can be great hard rock albums with substance but this is not one of them. This is just a balls out rocker and if that's what you are in the mood for then this is indeed one of the best!
B0001XAPZ6|2.0|The animation is excellent, the story surperb, the quality of the DVD is marginally acceptable... there is a small note on the back of the package 'may not work in all DVD players' All the anime DVD's I viewed on the Disney label intermittently pause or skip. It's interesting that this problem is limited to Disney DVDs. I am really disappointed. I've come to expect quality products from Disney, their DVDs are not!
B000004712|5.0|This is by far one of Hancock's best recordings (at least since the Headhunters, Thrust, Manchild days). He captures a strange haunting sound in the twilight between Jazz, Pop and Rock. When I come home from a long day there is nothing better than mixing a gin and tonic and putting on Herbie's fantastic version of \\"Norwegian Wood\\". The musicians seams to be completely in tune on this record, not just showing off talent but really putting there soul into it.<br /><br />If you dig Miles Davis on \\"In a Silent Way\\" or Coltrane in \\"My Favorite Things\\" then you are going to love this fantastic record. Tracks like \\"Mercy Street\\", \\"When Can I See You\\", \\"Manhattan\\" and \\"Love is Stronger Than Pride\\" are made of the good stuff, they are played with depth and skill in that rare way that makes a classic. In short this record can be put next to any great Jazz masterpiece.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Wow!!! This album is great. I'm a little skeptical because of the major label debut on Roadrunner, but not, this a great piece of art, beautifully complex with great arrengements, incredible rhythm section and the vocals are superb!!!!

0375703764|4.0|The way this book was composed was utterly amazing, and it took me weeks to read every last bit of it and process it all.  I was, however, disappointed in the way it ended.

B0001CCXY8|4.0|I like this band, and will most likely buy their new album....however, it would be nice if they would experiment with their style a bit, that and they need to get a better drummer. Other than that, this album is good...I like \\"Live Cannibalism\\" much better though.
1591840562|5.0|This is a fun and quick read. Don't be fooled though, Guy answers a lot of questions that don't get covered in any of the other books on entrepreneurship. For example, what is the appropriate percentage of the company to give to those you invite to be on your board of directors? Or how long should my powerpoint pitch be? These are the kinds of no nonsense problems that Guy explains more clearly than anyone else.  <br /> <br />This book won't teach you everything you need to know to be successful, but it will teach you things you need to be successful that you won't find anywhere else. For anyone considering starting a business or a non-profit, there will be many books you have to read, and this should be book number one.
0812550706|5.0|To describe this book to anyone as SciFi does it a disservice.  Don't get me wrong, I love SciFi, but whenever I try to tell anyone how great this book is, and I mention that it is a science fiction book, I get the old eye roll.  This book is incredibly well written with depth, intrigue, and a look into human nature that cuts you to the bone and shows the incredible talents of the author.  BRAVISIMO!!
B0006L16N8|5.0|Their new CD X&Y is incredible. Their past two were also very good, but Parachutes was kinda depressing and slow and A Rush Of Blood To The Head had a few weird songs. However, every song on X&Y is amazing! The choruses are strong and will be stuck in your head for days. The lyrics are moving and the vocals are awesome (go Chris!). So DEFINITELY buy this CD, it's absolutely worth it!
0312995423|3.0|This is a pretty typical Dan Brown novel: extremely fast-paced, fairly well-plotted and utterly implausible (though I'd say \\"Digital Fortress\\" is actually less implausible and probably not quite as factually inaccurate as \\"Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\"). In much the same way that \\"Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\" are rather murky and confused on the subject of religion, the politics in \\"Digital Fortress\\" are strikingly muddled. A 3-star rating is a little generous for this pulp novel, but, while Dan Brown may not be the best techno-thriller author out there, he is an absolute master at keeping a plot moving and keeping the reader moving along with it.
B0002B15XI|1.0|A cursory glance at the many critical send-ups of this film reveal most of its fans to be male.  Sad.  The humor (such as it is) is hostile, sophomoric and sexist.  I first saw this film on a date as an 18-yr-old and caused a stir in the theater by making retching sounds from my seat. I would do the same now.
6302906636|1.0|I must not understand the genre, because I though this was one of the worst movies I had ever seen. I picked it up because it had Sean Connery in it, and I have never before seen a Sean Connery film I didn't like. Not what I expected at all. Too weird.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Sheesh, enough of the negative reviews already.  This movie simply rocks!  I never read the book and probably never will so I really don't give a hoot if it doesn't follow the canon.  So why should you get this?  The story, which takes center stage over special effects (unlike say, Star Wars I-III) is engaging... on one hand an allegory of our dependence on foreign oil (spice = oil, Dune = Middle East), on another, the ascension of a messianic/warrior-god figure and the cross purposes of the parties that surround him: the witches (establishment religion) want to control him, the emperor and the guild navigators (political/economic powers) want to destroy him, and the Fremen (the masses) will die for him to attain liberty... and control of their destiny.  This movie also does well as a pure play sci-fi adventure.  Lots of dark humor too.  Gotta love the Baron (\\"that floating fat man\\"), his fetish for boys, and his disease-ridden face.  Finally, the Dune soundtrack just rules: Toto performed the entire score except Prophecy Theme which was by Brian Eno (personally, I love the scenes in which this theme is highlighted... such as the arrival at Dune and the water of life scene... very atmospheric).  Enjoy it for what it is.  EE has a few bits tossed in which throws off the pacing of the theatrical version IMO.
0307276902|1.0|Don't waste your time with this book.  It is just plain awful.  I could not bring myself to open the book and read another  page after a few chapters.

Especially what he was thinking at a given moment, and specific conversations he had?
B000EHRVP6|5.0|but is is still prone to rampant borrowing.  Then again, that is to be expected from Eli Roth, especially in a film produced by Tarantino.  We used to be the most copied in this genre, especially evident in Fulci's beloved Zombie (Zombi 2) being released in Italy as a sequel to Dawn of the Dead (Zombi).  Many have seen Roth's fellacious review of Audition on the \\"100 Scariest Moments in Horror\\" (on Bravo I think?).  After seeing his review, and the subsequent re-distribution by Lions Gate, I knew his next project would be heavily Miike influenced.  However, I was impressed by the originality and morality of the story, which is very American (Romero, for example), but is also inherent to the Horror genre as a whole.  I was also impressed with Miike's cameo in the film.  The film is not preachy, but very bleak in its explorations.  The masses may have forgotten, but Horror is always some sort of morality lesson, \\"these are all the bad things that happen if you do this.\\"  Roth is a very intelligent writer and Hostel shows the severity of his message.  The rampant drugs and nudity in the movie are necessary, because of how we are enticed by them.  I was excited when the nudity started because nudity, especially full frontal, is a sign that the censors were tested as far as possible, which means more gore, though I'm positive that many of the shots were sustained much longer than shown (I'm very excited for the unrated version).  If these women are to be reduced to mere objects, then the American men as torture victims is an equal exploitation.  Too often, American men, specifically certain groups, travel to other countries for the sole reason of obtaining sex, usually in a fetish context (ie for their youth, their nationality, their expendability).  This film shows what can happen when one goes to a foreign country for the purposes of satisfying carnal, or depraved, desires.<br /><br />Get the unrated version.  Anyone \\"too sensitive\\" wouldn't want to see this movie anyway (even with an R rating), plus unrated editions generally have more features.<br /><br />I would also recommend Miike's Audition if you liked this movie, not just to see the similarities and such, but because it is a fine film.

B00004SZWD|5.0|Whatever your mood, whatever your situation, Stevie Wonder has a song for you in this album.  These are 'songs', not little ditties to fill an album.  Stevie had a lot to say, and we are the beneficiaries of his talent.  There is a little bit of everything on this album, from ballads to political statements to good old-fashioned funk.  And what more could you want from an album?  This album was recorded when the vinyl told a story, from beginning to end, and took the listener from Point A to Point B.  Take this recording, find a lazy sunny Saturday afternoon, and find a soft spot on the floor.  Open your mind, turn the volume to a soft low rumble, and try to sit still.  You won't succeed on that last point, because the uplift from 'Sir Duke', 'I Wish', and 'Knocks Me Off My Feet' will energize you to clean the cabinet, dust the woodwork, call an old friend, and spend an hour smiling in a great mood.  This album is old-school, full of excellent musicianship, and a must-have for the audio collector.
B000BEZQ18|3.0|While I do not remember all of the songs being in the movie, much of the instrumental music evokes the beautiful scenery and the beautiful men. The song by Willie Nelson, \\"He Was a Friend of Mine,\\" is perfect for the film, and the song Emmy Lou Harris sings is nice, too. However, \\"King of the Road\\" and \\"It's So Easy to Fall in Love\\" would have been better left out. Rufus Wainwright and another male performer on the album are very good, as is the woman who sang in the movie at the dance Jack and his wife attended with another couple. If you loved the movie, you'll like this album.

0066620996|5.0|One of a rare find in today' obsession filled get rich quick and fix thy selves through outside experts craze.  This work by Collins will stand the test of time through his genius of untilizing a great research team, his honest and dogged way of finding the facts and his ability to apply his work in a form that all levels of society (from Top 100 corporations, governments and Social Sectors) can greatly benefit and improve their organizational model.  My only regret is that the book ran out of pages to read.  His website his just as great as his book and anyone can google and find it.  On a personal note, I actually emailed Jim Collins about my questions concerning his book and I received a personal and insightful response from his organization within a few days.....wow!!!!!!!!!

Using the base in this book, I've made many other variations that aren't given. <br /> <br />Since Peanut Butter Cup is my current favorite, I've managed to replicate it using the peanut butter recipe in the book.  As I said above, delicious!
0440237688|5.0|I thought the Giver was a very entertaining book. The novel explores a society where there are many boundaries and diversity is forbidden. In the novel Lowis Loury creates a Utopian Society by shielding everyone from the bad. It helped me realize the boundaries that our society gives us, in school especially.
B000BW7QWW|1.0|Having brought this DVD expecting an exciting new SCI FI flick I was bitterly disappointed. Having never seen the Firefly series and being advised by friends that I should, I went on to buy the DVD to see what the fuss was about. Big mistake, the acting was wooden and the details of character were so bad you didn't really care if the good guys won but worst of the entire plot was appalling. I would not recommend this film if you have not already seen the Firefly series, in fact I would not recommend this film unless you were born with a paper bag over your head.
0688145078|4.0|My son and I enjoyed reading this book and the illustrations.  The book shows the baby has already arrived and moves on from there.  I wish their was more on the waiting and hospital visit...but I liked it the same.  I liked how the book included that the brother could do things the little baby couldn't yet and how the boy wanted to take care of his new sibling!
0156027321|1.0|I got this book and started reading it.  Each time I read it, I fell asleeep.  This is not good.  I kept trying to read it and kept falling asleep.  The beginning is soooo slow.  I put it away for awhile and came back to it.  The second time around I was able to make it through but after reading it, I really didn't understand why it was as hyped as it was.  And I'm really not sure if what happenened on the boat was real or imagined but then again I really didn't care.

6305744793|5.0|Everybody MUST see this movie! Fantastic casting, outstanding direction, brilliant humor, which makes you laugh for all the movie. I've watched it about 20 times and I want to watch it over and over again.     The whole family tries to get Gomez's (Raul Julia) brother Fester back. They've been trying to do this for 25 years, but they got success only this time. Fester (Christopher Lloyd) was brought by Dr. Pinder Schloss (Elizabeth Wilson), who had found him near Bermuda Triangle 25 years ago. But the problem is that he's not Fester, he just wants to get the family's fortune and the doctor is his cruel mother. Morticia (Anjelica Huston) has some doubts about Fester and soon everybody in the family doesn't believe he's Fester. But Doctor convinces them he's not a liar and the sincere family looses their estate. But they're Addamses and they will survive!     As I've already said - casting is fantastic, but Anjelica Huston is the best as seductive Morticia. No one else plays witches better than Anjelica, real Grand High Witch of movie witches.      Gomez Addams is the best role of Raul Julia. And one the last ones of this wonderful actor.     Christopher Lloyd is really funny as Fester and Christina Ricci does her best playing Wednesday.      The rest of cast:      Judith Malina     as Grandma  Elizabeth Wilson  as Abigail Craven/Dr. Pinder Schloss  Dana Ivey         as Margaret  Carel Struycken   as Lurch  Dan Hedaya        as Tully Alford  John Franklin     as Cousin Itt  Jimmy Workman     as Pugsley Addams    Watch it!

B0000029LG|5.0|Disc 1 is a 15 track compilation of some of MJ's Greatest Hits and it does not disappoint!! with tracks like \\"Billie Jean\\" \\"Black or White\\" \\"Rock With You\\" \\"Man In The Mirror\\" \\"Beat It\\" and \\"Remember The Time\\" you really can't go wrong and it is sure 2 have u singing and dancing nonstop!    Disc 2 is 15 new MJ Tracks which does have a couple flaws but the majority of the disc is hot! my fav songs from Disc 2 include of \\"Scream\\" \\"They Don't Care About Us\\" \\"Stranger in Moscow\\" \\"Earth Song\\" \\"You Are Not Alone\\" \\"Childhood\\" \\"Tabloid Junkie\\" and \\"History\\". those are all hot tracks!, \\"D.S.\\" also sounds cool along with \\"2 Bad\\", Disc 2 probably could had done without \\"Money\\" and \\"Come Together\\" though, i just feel that they are both a let down and weren't needed, the last 2 tracks are \\"Little Susie\\" and \\"Smile\\" which are decent and listenable!    this is a great 2 Disc album from MJ! and i do recommend it! :)
0743454537|5.0|Jodi Picoult continues to impress me as an author. This is the 4th book of hers that I have read and I am continually impressed. Sisters Keeper does not disappoiont.  Dealing with tough subject matter, it tugs at your heart strings with out getting too emotional. I highly reccommend this book.
0684803356|4.0|Great ending...left to the imagination of the reader. Hemmingway does that a lot in this book. Lays down a scene, but does not complete it. Lets the reader imagine how it plays out. <br />Very accessible book. Puts the reader into the scenes with excellent, very detailed descriptions. And the characters are human...not perfect...not overdone. <br />Quick summary: An American spanish teacher from Montana is engaged to contribute to the Spanish civil war effort by bombing a bridge. He recruits a randy band of freedom fighters who are hiding out in a cave to assist. In the four days leading up to the bombing, he makes friends, makes enemies, falls in love, and eventually gets the job done, even though in the end he's not sure how he's contributing to the cause.
0780626966|5.0|we all know the story and so lets talk about set. each movie looks great and the extras are out of this world. of the films 1,3 are the best with the others falling somewhere inbetween. if you love freddy you'll love this set
1932907009|5.0|So here's the deal:  there are too many books -- and people -- out there who are sure that they have the answer for what it takes to write a great screenplay.   \\"Just read my book and a $100 million gross is only 9 months away.\\"   <br />  <br />Please. <br />  <br />Screenwriting is, arguably, the toughest of the writing disciplines.  It's a combination of experience (living a rich life), roll-up-your-sleeves craft (a blacksmith pounding metal) and spirited, original thinking (i.e. creativity).   It's Apollo and Dionysus getting along for months at a time.   <br />  <br />Those realities aside, Blake Snyder aims to simplify the brutal challenge of writing a screenplay -- particularly the studio, high-concept comedy.   One of the assets of his book, \\"Save the Cat,\\" is its lively, charming writing.  Another is that Blake is in the trenches writing and selling screenplays:  he knows what it takes to write and sell a screenplay and he is comfortable enough with himself -- and generous enough -- to share his ideas through his book, as well as through his workshops. <br />  <br />In \\"Save the Cat\\" you will find an enjoyable read on film structure, genre and character.  For me what was most valuable is the nuts and bolts of being able to crystallize your story in a \\"logline\\";  he calls it the DNA of your story, and he shows you how to do it.  It's tough work but it's analogous to the dribble-before-you-shoot school of basketball.  If you can't state the essence of your story in two sentences, you don't know your story, and by no means should you be typing \\"Fade In:\\" <br />  <br />You may wonder, \\"Well I only see two produced credits on IMDB for him; what makes him think that he knows. . . \\"   <br />  <br />Let me bring you in on a little secret:  there are hundreds of screenplays that are commissioned (for major money) by the studios every year, but that doesn't mean they're going to make it to a theater near you.  That's just a fact of life in Hollywood, but Blake is a working (and well paid) writer;  and this is his gift to screenwriters.   <br />  <br />Interestingly, \\"Save the Cat\\" has knowledge and insights that can help first-time writers as well as experienced pros looking for a little boost, perhaps a different perspective on playing the Hollywood game.  There's a lot of something in there for everyone. <br />  <br />Might I also add that if you have the opportunity to participate in one of his seminars, hurry up and do so ([...]  Blake has one workshop in particular where you bang out a step-outline (or beat sheet) of your story over the course of two days.  It's an exhausting weekend, but Blake is an inspiring type who can draw the bones of your story out of you so that you walk away with tangible results that you can apply to your writing the next day. <br />
B000002UAU|4.0|Somewhat of a let down but, then not even the Beatles could top Revolver and Rubber Soul. Overall, the boys sound tired, unfocused and flat out high. <br />She's Leaving Home is just gorgeous. Lovely Rita is sexy. John Lennon's orgasm at the end would make Eminem blush.Who does not love the dramatic tempo changes of a Day in the Life? Within You and Without You is another one Harrison's Indian death songs that is almost as good as the two on Revolver. <br />The production of Peppers is what really sets this set apart. The crisp sound isolates the vocal tracks so that the harmonies sound better than the leads. However, the slick production cannot fix everything. The rhythm section of Ringo and Paul sound like they have yet to be introduced and there is just too much silly filler here to compete with their best albums.  <br />Still there are many great memories contained here and perhaps one could give this classic an extra star for the Beatles visionary risk and nostalgia.
B00005JMX6|5.0|This is a kind of movie that you will feel really attached to it. It is more like the intersection point of American Pie and Love Actually. Of course there are no exaggrated jokes like in American Trilogy nor therea are distinctly attacted love triangles. However, there is acceptable fun, some scenes that will make you revise your past years and of course a bit of love. If you need a positive movie for your day, I can highly recommend you this very film.  <br />I have the unrated version and it is worth having it in my DVD collection.  <br />Do not miss it!!
B0002CHIJW|3.0|Jennifer ( Camille Keaton) is a writer from New York City that heads to a cabin in the woods for the summer, but soon four southern bumpkin men assault and rape her leaving her for dead. She then vows revenge to exterminate those cockroaches of men who did those things to her in horrific ways.<br /><br />Disturbing and unpleasant explotation horror drama that has became one of the most controversial movies of the 70's and still is. This movie has been slammed by the critics especially Siskel and Ebert who called this a \\"Vile smelly and putrid piece of man hating garbage\\" and a few critics did phrased the movie like Joe Bob Briggs, the movie went on to become a phenomenon on the video rental and sales market. The movie was originally going to be rated \\"X\\" for extreme violence ( especially that grotesque and graphic castration scene0, nudity and rape but the director was forced to cut some of the stuff off to get an \\"R\\" rating into theaters as it had a different title called \\"Day of the Woman\\" and when the alternate edition with the better title \\"I Spit on Your grave\\" came out in 1980 it was fully uncut on video, this has been called nothing but pro-femenist propaganda but i think it's a good and vile nasty little flick that does offer a good message about rape and the consenquences about it.<br /><br />This millenium edition DVD offers very good THX remastered picture and sound quality with some very nice extras like two commentaries: One by director-writer Meir Zarchi and one by film critic Joe Bob Briggs. There is a easter Egg in the main menu, click up and you'll see a photo gallery in the words \\"Grave\\" and the other extras include trailers, TV Spots, Radio Spots, reviews by critics, filmographies and foreign and domestic poster-and-still gallery, this is not a movie for easily upset but worth a view if you can handle this kind of subject matter.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Maniac ( 1980)\\", \\" Last House on The Left\\", \\"Blue Velvet\\", \\"High Tension\\", \\"Battle Royale\\", \\" A Clockwork Orange\\", \\" Cannibal Holocaust\\", \\"Cannibal Ferox\\", \\" Love and a .45\\", \\" 8MM\\", \\" A Time to Kill\\", \\" Kill Bill\\", \\" House on The Edge of the Park\\", \\"Caligula\\", \\" Man Bites Dog\\", \\" Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\\", \\" Axe\\", \\"Cabin Fever\\", \\"The Toolbox Murders\\", \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series & Remake\\", \\" The Hills Have Eyes\\", \\"Robocop\\", \\" The Toxic Avenger\\", and \\"Leon: The Professional\\".Royale\\", \\" A Clockwork Orange\\", \\" Cannibal Holocaust\\", \\"Cannibal Ferox\\", \\" Love and a .45\\", \\" 8MM\\", \\" A Time to Kill\\", \\" Kill Bill\\", \\" House on The Edge of the Park\\", \\"Caligula\\", \\" Man Bites Dog\\", \\" Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\\", \\" Axe\\", \\"Cabin Fever\\", \\"The Toolbox Murders\\", \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series & Remake\\", \\" The Hills Have Eyes\\", \\"Robocop\\", \\" The Toxic Avenger\\", and \\"Leon: The Professional\\".
0780622553|5.0|Dark City is probably the Godfather of all those Matrix type movies. The story, the cast, the movie and the musics are all a masterpiece. I am not overestimating the quality of the film but rather I am giving the credit that it deserves. There are a lot things to talk about the movie. The plot, the characaters, the scenes etc etc. I do not really waste your times. My one unique recommendation for all of you guys who are interested in buying this will be just one sentence: \\"Go for it, you will not regret\\"!! <br />It is not boring, rather it is delicate and deliberate in every sense. <br />Embrace it!!
B00003CXE7|5.0|Russel Crowe is unmistakeably the reason of this movies success. He is amazing, period. The movie starts of with action and the brute force that you woul expect in war, but then brings you in with drama and death. The emotion during the death of his family is one to be remembered. The whole movie is great, there is no end to your eyes being glued to the screen. <br /> <br />5/5, 10/10, MASTERFUL
B00005JOFO|5.0|First of all, I just want to lay it out there that I do not agree with most articles I have read by the professional reviewers on various web sites.  There seems to be a real drive in those reviews to emphasise the 'gay' aspect of the film and to make it seem as if the sole purpose of the movie is to make gay relationships more accepted.  The backlash of such reviews is the conservative side coming out and portraying the film as having an 'agenda'.  Unfortuenately this needless bickering overshadows the story of the film, which is a story of love, longing, and raw human passion.  Besides, though I don't know her personally, I'm quite sure that when Annie Proulx wrote the short story of Ennis and Jack, a gay acceptance agenda was the farthest thing from her mind. <br /> <br />The story of Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar is so much more than a 'gay cowboy' movie.  It is a tale of the love that you want so badly, but for one reason or another can't have.  That one love that creeps into your life and blindsides you, completely unexpected.  You didn't ask for it and didn't want it but it's there and you can't shake it.  Ang Lee did a brilliant directing job in provoking that 'hole in your soul' feeling, especially in the scene where Ennis and Jack part ways after their summer together and know that it's all come to an end.  They can't go on together and Jack looks longingly in his rearview mirror as distance gains between he and Ennis.  Ennis, so overcome by the confusion of his feelings and sense of loss that he gets that feeling in his stomach like someone has stuck their hand down his throat and pulled out his guts and he ducks to the side of the road with a case of the dry heaves.  The whole scene is shot with such authenticity on the part of the actors that you feel like the characters do.  It's not beautiful, it's not poetic, it's not a good feeling, but you feel it and can identify with it because at some point in our lives, we have all had that agonizing love lost feeling.  That is where Ang Lee has hit pay dirt.  If you read any story by Annie Proulx, you quickly learn that she is not all about what is romantic, good, and right.  She is more about what is true grit, hard life, pure human emotion rather it is wrong or right and often the wrong and right are very blurred in her stories.  I feel that Ang Lee did great justice to the original story by being able to visually blur those same lines. <br /> <br />The acting in the movie is superb.  I've read a few reviews that blast Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger for not seeming 'in love'.  Those reviewers must have a very candy-coated sense of just what love is.  I found the love between the characters to be quite blatant, just because they aren't exchanging roses and valentines doesn't mean there is no love. <br /> <br />The character of Ennis del Mar is supposed to be very rugged and rough around the edges.  He's a man of few words, and even less emotion.  Certianly not one for endearments.  Ledger's performance as Ennis is spot on.  His quiet but rough nature is perfectly conveyed, especially in the reunion kiss scene between he and Gyllenhaal.  In that one motion of forcefully grabbing the character of Jack by the coat collar and banging him up against the side of the building only to lay one of the most passionately hungry screen kisses I've ever seen on him was breathtaking.  You get a real sense of the character emotion that carries throughout the movie.  I found myself empathizing with Ennis's \\"you-dirty-son-of-a-bitch-how-dare-you-do-this-to-me-but-thank-god-you're-here\\" emotion, and judging by the mix of smiles and tears in the theater, I don't think I was the only one who felt that way.  That kind of audience empathy speaks volumes for Ledger's portrayal. <br /> <br />Jack Twist is a more emotionally charged character.  He knows he loves Ennis, and is happy for it.  He doesn't have the guilt feelings or the hang-ups in the relationship that Ennis does.  Jake Gyllenhaalembodies the rugged showman that is Jack.  Jack is the one that can bring the emotion from Ennis be it either by making Ennis laugh with some rediculious story or silly shenanigans or by pushing Ennis to the edge of his anger by laying the true emotions between them on the table.  Gyllenhaal puts the perfect spin on this character dynamic.  He's funny, emotional, loving, yet rough and antagonistic.  To genuinely portray such a multifaceted character is an attribute to Mr. Gyllenhaal's acting abilities. <br /> <br />The two actors play so well off of each other that you find yourself entranced by them and it is very difficult to seperate the actors from the characters.  They blend so perfectly that it's difficult to imagine that Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist are not real people.  Though I am not an actor, I would think that bringing that intense of a believability to your acting is the penticle of what you strive for as an artist.  Jake and Heath reach that level with ease in this movie. <br /> <br />I would recommend this movie to anyone, even my boss who swears that this movie has made John Wayne turn in his grave.  I think as an actor and an artist, and most of all as a human being, even good ol' Mr. Wayne would know the brilliance of this movie.  Even two weeks after having the Brokeback experience, I still find myself obsessed with Jack and Ennis.  This movie reawakened some lost feelings in me.  The sense of frustratiion, longing, and loss that happens to all of us.  It has reminded me of that gaping hole that is still in my heart that yearns for the one that I couldn't have.  This movie awakened a part of my soul that had been sleeping for a while, and for that I am eternally grateful to Annie Prolux for putting it out there on paper, to Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana for so genuinely rewriting it so it could hit the big screen, to Ang Lee for his brilliant vision and insight into human passion, and of course to the actors for bringing all of Prolux's rough-edged characters to life.
0790729628|1.0|I can't review it because you people took SOOOO long to try to deliver it, I got tired of waiting over 6 weeks for it and CANCELLED my order.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great dialog, characters all three dimensional.  Good scipts.  It's a shame series was cancelled.
B00000F169|5.0|I love Dark Star -- was thrilled to get a copy of it on DVD. John Carpenter went on, of course, to greatness, but this quirky little film with the antiquated special effects has a poignancy and humor that is very Dr. Strangelove-esque.  Very much a goofy start to a great career.
B00004RF9B|4.0|To watch this movie one can't help but notice the influences it had on future Sci-Fi movies. A crew goes to investigate the silence of a planet's colony. (think alien) only to find Dr. Edward Morbius & his daughter Altaira Morbius the only two survivors of a deadly attack by unknown forces some twenty years earlier. Leslie Nielsen stars as Commander John J. Adams and falls for Altaira along with the entire crew. [I've never understood Hollywood's need to throw romance into every movie.] The killings resume with the arrival of the crew which leads the skipper to investigate the good doctor bringing him face to face with alien technology better left forgotten. It would seem that the Krell were a very busy race. This movie proves that no matter how far we evolve the nature of one's sub-conscious mind cannot be suppressed. This is most evident when the perpetrator of the crimes yells \\"My evil self is at the door, and I have no power to stop it.\\"<br /><br />Despite this unnecessary development of romance this movie has a great storyline with a fair amount of good acting. (Remember this was filmed back in 1956). The film was nominated for Best Special Effects and you can see why. Some B-movies of today could learn something from this film. Anyway Robby the Robot as Robbie the Robot steals most of scenes he appears in. He's like a big metal genie granting every wish, much to the delight of James Dirocco, the cook.  My favorite line of the movie comes from Robby to Altaira, \\"Sorry miss, I was giving myself an oil-job\\". This is a great Saturday evening movie.
0553801503|5.0|This is a wonderful series of novels that any reader will enjoy and I'm thrilled about this latest edition.  Even for those who don't normally read fantasy novels, give these a try, you won't regret it!!
0312330537|5.0|The major thing I can say about this book is this: I feel I am in the presence of greatness when I'm reading it, and I knew it from the first page. I don't mean a dry, boring, heavy, or confusing greatness that some books are. I've loved every minute of reading Shantaram. It manages to be both a page turner, and a beautiful, honest, profound story full of lines I read over and over, because I want to hear them again & again. I love the people, and I love the way the author makes you love every one of them, just for who they are. He shows such beauty in the places he's been, even though some may think they're ugly. I've read so many books, and this may be the best book I've ever read (I don't say things like that unless I REALLY mean them.)  <br />
0385507755|5.0|I read the book being aware of all the contraversy in regards to it being published as a 'memoir'.  I watched the Oprah show with James Frey as a guest and regardless of all the hoop-la, he came across as a genuine person.  Regardless of the few enhanced storylines, 'Freys' authenticity still rang true to me.  His true self resonates throughout the book.  I loved reading it!
B00004XQ83|5.0|I love this style of music.  The voices are so raw and exciting and the beats are so fun and real.  Great, great music.

B000002GYW|5.0|The Eagles put forth some of the greatest songs of all time. Classic five point vocal harmonies and duelling guitars make these enduring classics. I highly recommend anything the Eagles ever put out in the 1970's.
B000E0WJIC|1.0|I hate to rain on everyones parade here but this band and album is not good. Before you automatically disregard this review maybe you should read what a person with a different opinion has to say. Yeah, they have the technical ability and yeah, its well produced (actually, its probably overproduced) but everything else about this band is such a sham from their cocky, holier-than-thou attitudes (these ex-nu metal kids actually claimed their the next Metallica which is just hilarious and sad all at the same time) to their cliched songwriting and silly image. Its very sad that most people are unable to realize what bands will be hitting the bargain bin sooner than later but B4MV is one of those bands, maybe not immediately, but it will happen. <br /> <br />The songwriting is beyond predictable and cookie cutter, the lyrics are cheesy, and basically you have a record that is for people who don't wish to be challenged or moved by the music they listen to. Everything is so formulaic here that it lacks any passion, heart, or real emotion. I think I heard Killswitch Engage, Atreyu and Trivium write this record over the course of the last few years. <br /> <br />These guys are coming in on the trail end of whats left of the world of metalcore and I've heard about 50 records that came before this written by other bands over the last 5 years and they all did it a 100x better. This is just milking the cash cow and it was absolutely a genius move on Sony's part to stick these guys on Trustkill in the US so they can have some \\"scene credit.\\" Stop listening to this stuff and go pick up an At The Gates album  and see where the majority of this beaten-to-death sound came from(sans the unbelievably annoying and whiny singing). You'll thank me for it later.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|Originally scheduled for a December 2005 release, A STAR IS BORN was delayed by Warner Home Video with no definite release date revealed.  Streisand fans are well aware that, out of her film career, only A STAR IS BORN and YENTL remain unreleased on DVD.  (YENTL will be released by Sony, which bought MGM/UA's library ... again, no official date set for that one). <br /> <br />On February 21, 2006, reps from Warner Home Video chatted online at hometheaterforum.com. Of the delayed STAR IS BORN disc, they said: \\"The approval process on the '76 STAR IS BORN is taking longer than we had anticipated, but it's happening and will be worth it.\\" <br /> <br />So, there is still no official release date, but at least they acknowledge they're working on it! Warner Home Video always does an excellent job on their DVD releases -- A STAR IS BORN ('76) will certainly be no different. I am most excited to hear the 5.1 mix Dolby Digital mix of sound. (I reported alll of this over at my Streisand fan site, [...]) <br /> <br />By the way, isn't this summer the 30th Anniversary of STAR IS BORN?  It was released summer 1976 ... and this summer is 2006.  That would certainly be a good selling point.
0743454529|3.0|I liked this book, but I didn't love it.  Picoult has an interesting writing style, which I enjoyed most of the time.  Too often, though, when one character asked another a simple question, the other would respond with a story or a metaphor.  The responses were interesting to read, but who really speaks so thoughtfully like that ALL THE TIME?  I also thought Anna's character was written too maturely.  I know that she's meant to be wise beyond her years, but there was pretty much no evidence of her being 13 at all, except for the times when her age was mentioned.  I still loved Anna very much though.  :) The ending, of course, I disliked.  It felt like the ending to another book...it just didn't fit.  And one more thing...I know that one of the themes of the book is sisters, and I did apprecaite Julia and her twin's storyline..but the romance between Julia and Campbell also seemed of another time and place. <br /> <br />There are many positive things to be said about the book.  The important questions it raises, Picoult's ability to create relatable, realistic (save Anna IMO), and lovable characters, the writing style, the fact that you really go through the emotions of the characters & understand how they are feeling.
B00005JO1R|3.0|This is a movie that benefits from two strong performances and chemistry between its leads. <br /> <br />The film follows a paint-by-numbers formula I have seen many times before. The dialogue does not measure up, but the actors make it work. <br /> <br />Joaquin Phoenix finally becomes a man and an actor in his own right -living out of the shadow of his legendary deceased older brother River Phoenix.  <br /> <br />Reese Witherspoon, who has become increasingly one-note and bland (and has the box office flops to prove it - Just Like Heaven, Vanity Fair) finds a role that allows her to stretch for the first time since her breakthrough in Election. Will she win the Oscar? Yes. Does she deserve it? No.  <br /> <br />The film Hollywood-izes drug addiction and infedlity. Could they make his first wife any more of a witch? But the love these two people share is real and the music is wonderful.
0451191153|5.0|I picked up _The Fountainhead_ again after having last read it 20 years ago in high school.  As a high school Junior, I appreciated many of the points discussed, but ultimately thought the book was dry and underdeveloped.  The characters were too stilted, and the dialogue and situations were implausible, it seemed to me.     While cleaning out a box of old books in my garage, I stumbled on my old copy of this book.  I picked it up and surprised myself by finishing it in a week and a half.  (Given its length and my two kids, that is fairly quick reading.)  What I had remembered as a dry treatise was to me now one of the most powerful and compelling books I have ever read.     My changing perception certainly reflects my increased maturity and life experience, in that I now realize that the book's fundamental issues of ethics and humanity's place in the world are central to a well-grounded life.  Rand's arguments are as powerful as they are profound, with a fictional world serving as a backdrop for a morality play between dominant, and in many ways unyielding, characters.  This book reminds me of the structure of Greek tragedies, in which characters are placed against each other by fate, and there is little to do but watch until their struggles end.    It is clear that Rand believes in free will, but her characters establish their choices early in life and continue in accordance with their chosen principles throughout the story.  This gives the characters a consistency that is unusual in modern literature, in which characters tend to be \\"nuanced.\\"  There is no nuance here.  The characters do not reflect people.  They reflect ideas.  And it is the interplay between these ideas, and ultimately the merit of each one, that is the focus of the author.    In this context, the structure of the book works brilliantly.  This is not an adventure book in which cowboys save the ranch, or a romance in which the hero seduces the illusive heiress.  Instead, it is an allegory for thedecisions we all face, and the competing demands on our morality and desires.  Do we pursue what we believe to be worthwhile, our dreams?  Or do we spend our lives doing what others tell us we should do?  Should our own happiness be our paramount goal?  Or is self sacrifice the pinnacle of morality? How should we treat those who have provided us with the resources we use daily?  And how should we treat ourselves?  Upon what basis do we recognize moral acts and immoral deeds?  These are all questions to which Rand provides a compelling answer; the individual's happiness should be the goal of the individual's life, and productivity (along with its recognition) is the key to happiness.      Over the 20 years since I had last read _The Fountainhead_, I have come to appreciate both the author's questions and her answers more than I would have expected.  I would encourage others to read this book (again).  Regardless of whether or not one accepts Rand's answers, one's life can only be improved by considering these fundamental issues.
B000055XMF|5.0|Wow, words cannot describe how incredible this movie was.  Made in 1979 but taking place in 1965, this film showed just what kind of social differences existed between teenagers in England.   <br /> <br />As I explained when I mentioned how Quadrophenia, the album was my favorite album of all time, the tale of one man's struggle to fit in a place filled with the bubble-gum-pop Mods and the punk leather-bound Rockers.  On screen, the film gives the album a new life outside of it's vinyl (now laser coated) birthplace.  It's very rare these days to see somebody take an album and make it into a film.   <br /> <br />In the past it's been done to such cult-success with films like Tommy, Pink Floyd's The Wall, and the dreaded assumed-forgotten, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. <br /> <br />But the way I see it, Quadrophenia actually had a real \\"real life\\" type of plot to it. <br /> <br />The classic \\"teen(s) rebelling against society's standards\\" that a lot of young people still deal with today.  Whether you made this movie in 1978 or 1988, or even 2008, you'll see people just like Jimmy, Steph, or Ace.  People just trying to fit in, even if it means becoming someone they're not. <br /> <br />Two thumbs up, five stars, and a huge applause for Quadrophenia, the movie. <br />
B0007TKNII|3.0|I loved this movie and it is a very worthwhile purchase, but I just expected it to contain special features and had no idea that the actual movie was the only thing on the non-special edition versions like widescreen and fullscreen.  What a bummer.  I know I should have looked more carefully, but why can't all of the discs have the special features to make things easier.  Anyways...not a critique against the movie...just a beef with the packaging and so forth.  In short, don't buy the non special edition versions because they will lack any fun features, which a grand movie like Phantom needs to include!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Is this a \\"gay\\" and ( or ) lesbian movie? NO , it`s a movie about life and how very precious life is. \\"RENT\\" > IMO &lt; Is far and away the best movie to come to dvd this year , of course there will be others that will surpass even \\"RENT\\". If you have not seen this , what are you waiting for ? Rent \\"RENT\\" or buy \\"RENT\\", as it will not be money wasted. It tells the story of friendship and love in the worst of times and measures that love within a year. It does not matter if you are so \\"politically correct\\" to dislike gay`s and lesbian`s , just watch it for the music and close your eyes. This is a movie that \\"hits where the heart is\\" and if you have a heart you will be moved by this movie. I only wish my late mom was with me to watch it , this would have been her kind of movie , even at 85 , had she lived. I`m as straight as they make`m , but I have a heart too. See this movie and find out if you have a heart !!
B000BEZQ18|4.0|For the most part, I was very pleased with the soundtrack.  I would have enjoyed even more of the orchestral pieces (a 2 minute one here and there wasn't enough to truly capture the feeling of the movie).  And \\"The Maker Makes\\" greatly moved me and was the best of the vocal tracks.  Very good overall!
6305537321|1.0|I love old movies but this one I just didn't get. I love George Peppard too but this movie was about an immature girl, who I could barely understand throughout this movie, who wants to marry into money. George Peppard lives in the same building as Audrey Hepburn and he starts to see Audrey as someone who he could have a normal relationship with, he was a kept man who was involved with an older married woman and eventually gets rid of her for his chance for real love. Of course Hepburn is too stuborn to risk it all with this poor writer (Peppard) so she tries to marry a rich man. Finally when your about ready to fling this DVD out your window Hepburn wakes up and recognizes that she has been selfish and retarded and that true love was there all along. This movie was incredibly slow I almost shut it off but I really thought it would get better, well it didn't come together until the last 10 minutes. It was a waste of time, which I couldn't believe for such a classic movie.
0307276902|3.0|As an employee of a major recovery home, I knew pretty quickly (the dental thing)the author had taken some license. Nobody would get away with that stuff (not going to meetings) where I work! The staff characters were pretty true to form.  A good read.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|John Mayer is a musician with some extraordinary talents. I am not referring to what the typical John Mayer listener is probably thinking about. I am not talking about his sensitive songwriting or his boyish good looks or any of that. I am talking about his ability to sing and play with such feeling that even true blues/soul enthusiasts are moved by it. John has an incredible voice and he has a great tool to accompany it...control. He knows his vocal limitations and plays around freely within them. The most pleasant surprise on this record is John's explosive guitar playing. A true music fan can tell that John plays with true passion and you can tell that he has paid attention over the years. His playing at times is reminiscent of Eric Clapton and at times it is reminiscant of SRV and yet his playing always has an element of originality. I hope John's records in the future continue to surprise us with soulful vocals and powerful blues riffing. This album is a must have for fans of good music.
B000E1155E|1.0|There's original music-and then's there more of the same.  This is more of the same.  Just like Kings of Leon, take some guys, put them in a room with old records like the CLASH (I hear London Calling right now in track 10), Led Zep (track 11-I hear Heartbreaker now).  I know the critics love this one-but remember two things-first, they get the music free-not having to pay for it like us, and secondly, it's \\"wilding\\", one critic goes wild about the next new thing and the others follow-just like a pack of schoolkids.  Why do I even read their reviews?  As for the others here, how do I explain them-I don't. It's somewhat like hearing and liking what others tell you to like.  Think for yourself and buy something else, like Ray Davies.  I'm close to the end of listening to this disk for the third time.  Now, I dislike it more than before and have gone from two stars back to one star because I can't do zero stars.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|I am a huge Red Hot Chili Peppers fan and am too anxiously awaiting their next tour this summer to my home, SoCal.  So to make up for my thirst for more Chili Peppers I bought their live DVD.  I felt like I was a member of the audience.  Anthony's vocals were superb, John's guitar and backup vocals were awesome, Flea had that sick skeleton costume, and Chad kinda looks like Will Ferrel from a distance with his Cubs hat on, oh ya and his drumming was excellente.  Every song was absolutely incredible and the song selection was awesome (they played all of my favorite songs) my only minor complaint is they didnt play any of their older stuff, but then again Chad and John weren't in the band back then, so I guess its not so crucial.
B000CCD0FI|5.0|After purchasing all the remastered albums and listening to both sides of these dualdiscs inside and out, I have come to the earth-shattering conclusion that SPEAKING IN TONGUES is in fact their finest achievement.  Prior to these reissues, I was a devotee of FEAR OF MUSIC and REMAIN IN LIGHT, but the extraordinary remastering here reveals previously indistinct, nuanced layers.  Indeed, all previous iterations of this album were compromised (especially the truncated versions of some of the songs on the original vinyl release), while this is the definitive version.  Songs are finally allowed to play out as extended jams, and it adds to the overall free-form feel.  Even more than REMAIN, this is their most experimental sounding album, and the tracks that I once wrote off as filler (\\"Pull Up The Roots,\\" \\"I Get Wild/Wild Gravity\\") now sound both resistently enigmatic and eminently danceable.  In comparison, LITTLE CREATURES sounds all the more diminished, while TRUE STORIES is, well...pretty terrible (although I'm partial to about half of NAKED).  And O-U-T (but no hard feelings...)
B000002H6C|4.0|I'm not going to go through and talk about each song because I think you're old enough to listen to the snipets on here and judge for yourself which is a good track and which is a bad track. What I am going to do though, is tell you a little about this dark and strangely mixed CD. First off, this is Metallica's fourth full length ablum and the first not to featured revered bassist Cliff Burton (RIP). Filling in for him is former Float Sam and Jetsam bassist Jason Newsted. This CD is quite different from other Metallica albums and sadly is the begining of the end. How is it different? The songs are much more longer and more complex than those on previous albums and for the most part are generally slower (except for the classic \\"Blackened\\", the last few minutes of \\"One\\" and the 200 miles an hour \\"Dyers Eve\\", which is the fasted song Metallica have done) These songs are chocked full of time signiture and riff changes and are LONG. Two clock in at over nine minutes and the shortest songs are still five minutes long, which isn't a bad thing (unless you have ADD)The compostions are far more complex than other Metallica and have a heavy classical influence, especially the title track. One of the first things you'll notice when listening to this is hey! where's the bass? Sadly Jason is buried deep with in the mix through out the album. It's almost as if Metallica was sending a message to the word. A message like, Cliff was such a huge part of us and he left a massive whole in us that no one can ever fill. Which is a shame because Newstead has some great basslines. The lyrics are a high point of this album and show that a great deal of thought went into them. James' voice is at its best imho - growly and angry with just a touch a raspiness. Some of Kirk solos are really interesting and just a joy to listen too. While Lars has never been a great drummer, I fully enjoy his drumming on this album. Even better than his drumming is the sound of his kit, which is perfect imo: the clicky big sounding kick drum and the tight warm sounding snare.<br /><br />Pros: Metallica are at the top of their game lyrically and musiclly. Kirk plays some of the best solos of his career. The composition work is much more complex and better than anything else Metallica has done. Lars' playing and James' vocie are at their respective best.<br /><br />Cons: Horrible production hurts this album. For the most part Jason is buired so far into the mix that you really have to strain yourself to hear him and in some spots he is more or less completely inaudible. But its not just the lack of bass, its as if someone chopped the whole CD off at about 5,000 hertz.<br /><br />Long songs might put some people off. Some of the songs are weaker than others.<br /><br />Final word: This really should be about a 4.5 but the horrid production, I feel, hurts it too much to warrent a 5. But this is really one of Metallica's best and probably my personal favorite of theirs. If you like Metallica at all this should be in your collection.clicky big sounding kick drum and the tight warm sounding snare. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Pros: Metallica are at the top of their game lyrically and musiclly.

B0000YWKHC|4.0|I loved the way that the film contrasted the Westerners with Japanese culture. There was no connection. The Japanese weren't given english subtitles (to help us feel the confusion and overall alien-ness of the experience, too). The film made me feel like I was an insomniac (but it was supposed to). The protagonists could not relate to any of the non-Westerners but only to one another. I found that to be really super realistic and a refreshing respite from the no-matter-where-we're-from-we're-really-all-the-same bullpucky found in most other movies. A good movie!
1581806574|4.0|NeonDragon's beautiful creatures have had my attention for a few years now, and I am proud of how well she did on her \\"How to\\" book. I've been drawing for several years, but could never manage dragons quite as well as I wished. NeonDragon's book was very helpful; it broke down the complex and ununiform dragon into simple steps with plenty of colorful visuals. NeonDragon even made it simple to personalize my drawings by giving examples of different horns, body and leg shapes, wings, and all other things that make dragons unique. The parts on other mythical creatures wasn't as in depth, but still held my attention and gave me some ideas. It is filled with NeonDragon's humor and spirit and is a wonderful book for one struggling to make thier dragons look good and believable.
B00005JOQ9|1.0|Yes, I will admit, I am from Slovakia ... and yes, there are prostitutes all over the world, including my motherland but I have to tell you that what is happening in Cancun every time high school graduates go there NEVER happened in my country or anywhere in Europe. Not mention Las Vegas and other cities where prostitution is a huge business. I just don't agree that all girls in my country are \\"horny\\" and will have sex with anyone speaking English, especially with American accent. To have a sex with someone is a matter of sympathy and chemistry and American passport doesn't open door to any Slovak or other European bed or east European bed, if you will ... another try to move central European country to the east ... I think that during last years us, Slovak people living in US, we got used to misplacing our country (USA Today described Slovakia with sea - of course it was Slovenia - but hey, who expect at least basic geographical knowledge of Europe from US journalist??? - Not me, not anymore :) <br />My suggestion and advice? Next time you will make a movie, set the movie in non-existing, fictive country - the same as your story. I've heard that Eli Roth received invitation from Slovak government to visit (finally) Slovakia and learn more about this country - where he can spend time with other Jewish people and understand the culture and finally know the truth! <br />
B000A78Z82|4.0|More than enough has been said about Devendra's unique musical talents and style.  His voice and the world it draws you into is nothing short of a swirling fever dream, a place that is almost perfectly encapsulated by the Sgt. Pepperesque album art.  Devendra's songs will enlighten, charm, enliven, and in some instances frighten. <br /> <br />Just as a warning, unless you are capable of allowing music to inhabit its own world and live by its own rules, you will find it difficult to fully let go and enjoy someone like Devendra Banhart.  One example, the song \\"Little Boys\\", simply cannot be taken in literal terms without being borderline disgusting. <br /> <br />\\"I see so many little boys I want to marry...I see plenty little kids I want to have...in the shower I get my dreaming done.\\" <br /> <br />As for me...I can appreciate that a song is a song...or if coming from Devendra, it's a trip. <br /> <br />Trip on Devendra. <br /> <br />Trip on.
B000002GQK|5.0|This group of songs by the MOODY BLUES, is for me their best album ever. Every song is a masterpiece. Every member of the band gave a gift with a great song. As always, record company executives, are not in tune with their artists and public, and only one song from this cd, was released and promoted as a single: The Story in your Eyes.  I remember, other songs from this cd being played by the radio (FM)mainly \\"Our guessing game\\", and also \\"One more time to live\\" \\"You can never go home\\" and \\"My Song\\". <br /> <br />It is not as \\"progresive\\" as other Moody Blues records, because the songs have more enphasis in band-synphonic orchesta relation. Also the band is at their prime with songwriting. <br /> <br />After this cd, the Moody Blues never sounded as a unit band as this. After the next one \\"Seven Sojourn\\" the band broke up or took a long rest for a while; when they came back, their producerm, the sound of the guitars and also, the keyboard and melotron player Mike Pinder was gone, changin the sound of the band forever. <br />  <br />EVERY GOOD BOY DESERVES A FAVOR, deserves a chance to be heard by those who missed the first time out, or want to learn how the masters created great music for the times to come. <br />
B00006G8HX|4.0|The signs were there in \\"The Wrath of Khan\\": Spock's mumbling of the word \\"remember\\" to a semi-conscious McCoy; the soft landing of Spock's torpodoe-coffin on the surface of the Genesis Planet; and the phrase so often stated by Spock himself--\\"there are always possibilities\\". So it shouldn't have been a surprise when Paramount Pictures--wisely \\"leaving the door open a crack\\"--announced \\"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock\\". It was a stroke of genius--and good press--to tap Leonard Nimoy to direct the film. And it made sense, too--since Nimoy's character was supposedly \\"demised\\", it freed him from being in front of the camera and moving behind it.  <br />TSFS picks up where TWOK left off: after the formation of the Genesis Planet, a battle-scarred Enterprise limps back to earth with a skeleton crew. The emptiness of the ship echoes the thoughts of its captain, James T. Kirk. While licking his wounds over the loss of his fallen comrade, he discovers that Dr. McCoy is behaving strangely, showing signs of schizophrenia. <br />Mark Lenard makes a grand and welcome return to the fold as Spock's father, Ambassador Sarek. In a well-played and dramatic scene, Sarek mind-melds with Kirk to determine if Spock's Katra--his living soul--inhabits Kirk. Soon, both discover that his Katra is being kept by someone else--guess who?  <br />The boundaries of loyalty, friendship, sacrifice, and courage are tested as Kirk and crew put their careers on the line to retrieve Spock, bring him to Vulcan, and perform an ancient but dangerous ritual to restore his Katra to its rightful owner.  <br />What keeps this film from being truly great are some production flaws: when David Marcus and Lt. Saavik arrive on the Genesis Planet to investigate strange readings, the rocks and vegetation surrounding them looks absolutely fake. They're reduced to being 2 actors trudging thru a large studio set. Also, while the fight between Kirk and Commander Kruge is well done--made more thrilling because the planet is falling apart around them--the scene is marred by some phony effects.  <br />TSFS has a stirring musical score as well as key moments that are emotionally powerful: the destruction of the Enterprise (while Kirk and crew watch helplessly from the planet's surface as it goes down in a ball of fire--I had a lump in my throat when I first saw it); and the death of Kirk's son, David, as he \\"atones for his sins\\" concerning the planet's ill-fated formation (and consequential self-destruction) by sacrificing himself to save Spock and Saavik. <br />Given the almost-thankless task of the \\"heavy\\", the talented Christopher Lloyd manages to raise his role of Klingon Commander Kruge above being more than a \\"stock villain\\". He's even given a delicious line: \\"Genesis--I want it!!\\" Best of all, Scotty, Chekov, Sulu, and Uhura are given their moments to shine as they aid their captain in breaking Starfleet rules and doing what they think is best. Actor James Sikking (a familiar T.V. face) offers comic relief as the pompous Capt. Styles, commander of a sleek new starship, Excelsior. And Robin Curtis takes over the role of Saavik with precise stoicism. Although she lacks the nuances of Kirstie Alley, she nevertheless looks more like a Vulcan than Alley.  <br />Nimoy deftly weaves action, adventure, \\"human emotion\\", and Vulcan mysticism into the fabric of the storyline. He could've hit a brick wall in the climax (as in the unfortunate case of \\"Trek 5\\"), but Nimoy's clever enough to add enough surprises and close calls to make the journey in restoring Spock worthwhile.  <br />TSFS may not be perfect, but it sure is a wonderful ride!

It doesn't.<br /><br />I felt that \\"The Accused\\" dealt with the subject of rape & the aftermath rather well, (the rape scene in \\"Accused\\" was more brutal), with this film, Alex is raped & the viewer is left with a big question mark, as far as, if she lives or dies. Maybe thats why the film unspools in reverse. The last image of \\"Irreversible\\" has Alex in the park lying on a blanket reading a book. it's a halfway peaceful ending to a powerful film (until the weird spinning & light effect takes over).<br /><br />It also seemed that Alex could have escaped her captor, at the very least in the beginning of the ordeal (kneed him the balls or something) but the film falls for the usual sympathetic victim route. I also felt the rape scene went on too long for somebody not to notice what was happening.<br /><br />\\"Irreversible\\" is a powerful film that should be seen, but, be prepared for some graphic images.left with a big question mark, as far as, if she lives or dies.

B000784WMW|5.0|Another Jane Eyre DVD for my collection!  I loved it!  Thanks!
B00006F83Y|5.0|This is one of those rare albums that floored me the first time I heard it. I ceased all other activity and just listened all the way through. Then I listened to it again. Quite simply, this is one of the catchiest, best constructed albums to have ever come out, regardless of genre.<br /><br />For the Queens it was definitely a high water mark, with a classic line-up that included Dave Grohl on drums and significant vocal contributions from Mark Lannegon. It's a combustible combination and every song is propelled with a fierce energy.<br /><br />I'm not sure that the Queens will ever make another album to rival this one. Due to the heavy rotation of band members and various guest appearances, each new project is significantly different. No matter, Songs for the Deaf is an album for the ages. If you think they stopped making good rock in the seventies, you haven't heard the Queens yet.

B0009X7664|4.0|This is a fabulous package.  I spent last evening watching the film and all of the extras, then went to bed quite tired but extremely happy.   <br /> <br />My only caution to perspective buyers is in regards to the \\"promotional posters\\" that are supposed to be in the package.  I did not receive any with my purchase from amazon, and when I checked with some big box stores, their copies were also missing these reproductions.  After searching Universal Home Entertainment's website, I found a customer service page.  Keep your receipt if you want the reproductions - check Universal's site for more information.  They will send you the reproductions at no charge(they are magnificient), but it will take a few weeks to process.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|This album is amazing.  I'm not sure that I've ever been affected by a soundtrack like this before!  Listening to this is like watching the movie over and over again.  Emmylou Harris was the perfect pick to sing \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old\\" - the tearfulness in her voice is haunting, touching.  The instrumentals, the new music as well as the remakes by Willie Neslon and Rufus Wainwright round out this musical collection, and, with any love story, the Teddy Thompson's \\"I Don't Want To Say Goodbye\\" says it all.

B000000OR9|5.0|A fantastic combination of musical talent!!  The song writing is incredible.  Sex Child, Jelly Roll, & Blue Murder rock hard.  Ptolemy & Valley of the Kings are great pieces.  The musicianship is unbelievable.  John Sykes did a hell of a job putting this thing together.  Carmen Appice is the go-to guy, not only for banging the drums, but his song writing & vocals are exceptional.  Give Black-Hearted Woman & Out of Love a few listens as well.  Wish these guys lasted longer.  Check out Appice with Pat Travers here on Amazon.

B0002234LS|5.0|This movie is the best. I saw this when it first came out in the theater and boy was I amazed. It gave me the feeling like I was sitting down with good old king and reading a short story. His original short story is about 200 pages but I was really thrilled when they signed on john tuturro and johnny depp. Perfect method actors. I swear, I watch this one over and over again. It's another one of those writer's block movies that turns into a psychological thriller. You'll love the ending. \\"The only thing that matters is the ending. It's the most important part of the story, the ending. and this one is very good. This one is perfect.\\"
B000784WMW|5.0|I SAW THIS MOVIE FOR THE FIRST TIME A WEEK AGO. <br />I RENTED IT FROM THE VIDEO STORE BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE THE DORIS DAY MOVIE I WANTED <br />WHAT A DELIGHTFUL AND SURPRISING TREAT! <br />I SAW THE ORSON WELLS VERSION..

B000001FS3|5.0|I am not a big fan of U2 but I like The Joshua tree which was amongst the finest albums to come out of the eighties.Most of the songs are good,especially WHERE THE STREETS HAVE NO NAME and WI OR WITHOUT YOU.This is one album which should be present in your collection.recommended.
B0009TRRN0|3.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time but the quality is simply aweful, not worthy to be sold as a DVD. Why don't they go back to the original and get a decent rip?
B000B19BCG|5.0|Well, they've done it again and once again the US isn't taking notice. Supergrass produces a wonderful disc demonstrating their continued growth as songwriters and arrangers. With the dirth of good music on the US charts you think somebody would take notice. Enough of the rant and onto the music. <br /> <br />The opening to \\"Tales of Endurance\\" almost has a 'Deadwood' flavor before gliding into a gorgeous melody. It gets better with \\"St. Petersburg\\" which is a great haunting song that you don't want to end. My other personal highlights are \\"Low C\\" and \\"Fin\\".  <br /> <br />It is unlikely that Supergrass will ever get the acclaim they deserve. In the past 10 years they have only produced 5 new discs. All have been exceptional and always taking a slightly different turn.
B000002J1S|4.0|Genesis' magnum opus is probably this double album.  <br />Their sound textures e melodies are really esquisite and beautiful, their ensemble playing is magnificent. <br />However the sound effects are quite weird or you may call them baffling - as well as some of the imagery in the lyrics and main motif - Peter Gabriel couldn't get any complicated than that time....
031286504X|4.0|I make it a habbit not to read too much into the reviews as too many times plots are ruined and the whole story is given away. I'm glad I didn't read the editorial review on this book here on Amazon as it gives just about everything away!!! If you haven't read it, good, don't! If you have, well it's still a great story eventhough the review blew the ending for you.<br /><br />Just to clear things up, this book has around 10 stories in it. The title \\"I am legend\\" is the first story in this book and the longest.<br /><br />I am Legend is a great story. Matheson's style of writing is a bit jagged but it adds tremendously to the atmosphere. I thought about this story many days after I read it. It's the kind of story that will kick you in the head.<br /><br />Do your self a favor and pick it up, it's a quick read and worth it.<br /><br />So far I've read several of the other shorts in the book and they are ok. Sort of Twilight Zone-ish, nothing that really stood out so far. These are just quick little reads at bed time.<br /><br />All the pages following the title story could have been blank for all I care. I am Legend was that good.
B000003CM8|5.0|Because their live sets are so legendary, the original Allman Brothers Band's first - and, alas, only - two studio albums are somewhat overlooked. Granted, the band would only reach full fruition on later releases like AT FILLMORE EAST and EAT A PEACH, in the process expanding and improving many of the tracks from this album and its follow-up, IDLEWILD SOUTH; but right from the start the Brothers were a musical force to be reckoned with, and their regrettably small output is an essential part of any comprehensive collection.     Like Santana, whose own debut album was released almost simultaneously, the ABB took an innovative approach to rock, adding jazz, gospel, bluegrass and even classical elements which few of their contemporaries had the chops to tackle. With the matchless guitar talents of Duane Allman and Dickey Betts, first-rate white blues singing from Gregg Allman and an expanded rhythm section - bassist Berry Oakley and drummers Butch Trucks and Jaimoe - this was a sextet which could and did make magic out of anything.     Opening with the slamming \\"Don't Want You No More,\\" a nasty blues instrumental which rivets the attention from its very first note, THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND showcases an already fully realized vision, with one foot in the soil and the other in the stars, quite unlike anything else out there even in those heady days of 1969. \\"Not My Cross to Bear\\" gives Gregg some room to start shouting as only he can, and the Jimi Hendrix-influenced \\"Black Hearted Woman\\" is a nonstop sizzler. \\"Trouble No More,\\" which would become a staple of the Brothers' live shows, gets its initial ABB workout here as well, leaving the second half of the album for the lengthier, heavier explorations at which this band always excelled. \\"Every Hungry Woman\\" opens with a reverbed bayou slide intro from Duane which sounds like the cover of a horror comic book, then segues into a countrified hard-rock performance of superlative tightness and menace. \\"Dreams\\" is as ethereal as its name, a slow sensual groove held aloft for seven minutes by the rhythm team's restraint and Duane's boundless imagination. Finally, the original \\"short\\" version of \\"Whipping Post\\" gives both guitarists a chance to shine as Gregg spits out his self-penned tale of a hapless man's victimization at the hands of a no-good woman. The transcendent finale, with the whole band seemingly straining at the very borders of its own and its instruments' capabilities, would be extended but never fundamentally altered onstage.     THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND remains a fine offering from the finest of rock bands, if a rather brief one at barely half an hour. For this reason, the reader is advised to seek out BEGINNINGS, which pairs this album with the similarly abbreviated IDLEWILD SOUTH, thereby getting both of the Brothers' studio efforts on one disc for the same price.
0877951861|5.0|I agree that this is perhaps one of the best thrillers, though for me the first third of the book was a little hard to plow through, but the last 2/3 of book had me coiled tight with anticipation.  Also-this is 28 year old book and it hold through the test of time.  Lucy was a remarkable and unforgettable character.  Highly recommended
B00008QSA5|5.0|If you haven't heard this one, do yourself a favor and get a copy.  Outstanding blues and jazz-rock.  Al Kooper...where are you when we need you most???
0694003611|5.0|This is the book that makes bed time bearable for our 20 month old.  It has been her favorite book for about 3-4 months now.  She loves it.  As her vocabulary has expanded, she points out & says more items on the pages.  Sometimes we don't even read it but just point out different things, but we both have it memorized anyway!  :)
0395645662|5.0|The Giver introduces the reader to a fictional society where nothing lacks structure. There is a time and place for everything. The extremely strict conditions in the novel awaken the reader to the nature of the world we all live in. The journey of Jonas, the main character captivates the reader and keeps them surprised with each new revelation about the main character's strange community. I recommend this book to any reader who is looking for a strange but exciting adventure.
078681859X|2.0|Well folks I can tell you that the turning point in this book was when Stroud thought it would be cute to take a jab at the Harry Potter franchise. Those of you that have read this book know EXACTLY what I am talking about. The talk about \\"Boarding Schools\\" and \\"Scars\\" was pretty lame and a sign of insecurity. <br /> <br />First off I don't like Nathaniel, he's a an idiot of a kid no matter what happened to him. He's still a snot-nose brat. Bartimaeus is a little too smug and cocky, he thinks he's so cool but he more comes across as a dork. His shape shifting is pretty weak and unimaginative. <br /> <br />I don't really like any one in this story so far (200 or so pages into it). Authors are supposed to dangle tempting carrots in front of the readers to keep them interested but so far...We'll I just don't give a darn about the amulet, the dijinn, the boy, the clich \\"mean master\\" or any of it.  <br /> <br />The time that it takes place is modern time. With computers and the like, it takes place in England with your typical English accents sprinkled in here and there. Stories such as this don't do well in times that we percieve as normal. It's not like the magic is something that's hidden and no one knows about, in the book its a normal every day thing. It's hard to buy into fiction set in a non-fiction setting, in fact its down right annoying. <br /> <br />This book may be good for young readers but I for one just can't seem to get into it. Half way through I think is a pretty good try. <br /> <br />The two good things about this book is that Stroud does a good job describing action scenes. He has a talent for that and conveys detailed imagery on what's going on. It's a hard thing to do well and he does it great. And the second thing is the cover, I bet tons of books were eagerly snatched up due to just the cover. But remember this, great marketing won't change the content. <br /> <br />Like I said, I wanted to like it buuuuut.....*shrugs* <br /> <br /> <br />
B000003CM9|5.0|The Allman Brothers Band's 1970 sophomore effort finds them altering and expanding upon the \\"space blues\\" leanings of THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND, highlighting songwriting and nuancing skills more than its predecessor but arguably coming up more of a mixed bag as a result. The mix is quite a good one, however, and testifies as much as any of the original ABB's efforts to the truly tragic nature of this group's premature demise. <br />   \\"Revival\\" introduces guitarist Dickey Betts as a composer, and as its title suggests the song is basically a gospel hosannah done Brothers-style. While perhaps a less whelming opener than \\"Don't Want You No More,\\" it shows the band moving into new territory, exploring the full range of its musical roots and - most important - showcasing the songwriting of its various members. \\"Don't Keep Me Wondering,\\" a Gregg Allman tune, brings things back into the band's well-dug blues vein with a funky shuffle of instant appeal; it's small wonder this song became a regular concert workout for the ABB. \\"Midnight Rider\\" may well be the Brothers' greatest studio recording - an absolutely flawless three-minute study in mood, atmosphere and individual and collective musicianship, it's worthy of inclusion on THE SUN SESSIONS. Dickey's instrumental opus \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed,\\" soon to be disemboweled to heart-stopping effect on AT FILLMORE EAST, closes side one of the original LP with an effective nod to the Brothers' jazzier capabilities and leaves no doubt that this is a unit with at least two full-fledged songsmiths in its fold. \\"Hoochie Coochie Man,\\" the lone cover tune here, sets a mediocre vocal by bassist Berry Oakley over an earthquake performance by the band, with drummers Jaimoe and Butch Trucks particularly tasty. \\"Please Call Home\\" is a lovely ballad by Gregg, whose sung heartache plays beautifully against Brother Duane's loping, melancholy guitar. \\"Leave My Blues at Home\\" throws its hands up on all the pain, hope, fear and bragadoccio of the previous tracks to end the album on a gruffly, almost threateningly affirmative note. All this in just over thirty-two minutes! <br />   IDLEWILD SOUTH is, at the very least, a minor masterpiece from an era when masterpieces were almost common; and while its achievements may have been quickly overshadowed by those of AT FILLMORE EAST and EAT A PEACH, its own strengths remain undeniable and its songs - several of them, at least - unforgettable.
B00000DHRX|4.0|A great collection--thought I do like one Disc better than the other.  I've heard that GM has been talking about retiring-which is a shame, but frankly I didn't follow him into his techno-music phase.  But this CD is the good stuff.  Highly recommended.
0679805273|5.0|This book is right up there with all of Dr. Seuss' books!  It's perfect for the high school or college graduate, although it will appeal to youngsters as well.  Every time we have a graduate in the family or among my friends, I purchase this book and tuck a gift of cash (money order) inside.  Every time, the young person who receives it has found the money, so I KNOW they are reading past the front few pages!  I recommend \\"Oh, the Places You'll Go!\\"

B00006G8G4|4.0|First of all,anyone who calls themselves Brodyman from Amity Island is the biggest dweeb on the planet and has no imagination.Spiderman was supposed to be a geeky teenager, so Toby McGuire was not a bad choice.If you don't like comic books and you are writing a review of this DVD then you must not have any life to speak of.This is a fun movie and aside from the goblins power ranger mask it was well done and stayed pretty true to the original comics.
0784010218|4.0|This timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be dated. I can't even count how many times I've seen Dirty Dancing. This is one movie that I could probably watch every few weeks and still love.<br /><br />There is something timeless about this movie. I have loved other \\"blockbuster love story movies\\" like Pretty Woman. I think it's up there but there is something about Dirty Dancing that just makes it absolutely perfect. The characters, the chemistry between Swaze and Grey, the movie's direction, the amazing dancing, the warm summery atmosphere, everything about dirty dancing is absolutely perfect. It is an instant classic and I've never really seen a movie like it either before or since.<br /><br />I don't think there is one particular element that makes this movie so loved but many things, a lot of which are mentioned by numerous reviewers. Dirty Dancing has a nostalgic, languid, summery mood, realistic characters, a relateable honest message coupled with incredible music and dancing, and the one of the best dance sequences cinema has ever given us.<br /><br />This movie is always on TV and I will continue to watch it as long as they show it. But I WILL mention I have no interest in seeing \\"Havanna Nights\\", this one they should have left alone.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This DVD set is completly worth it.  It's funny, has great charecters, has some romance here and there, and is just an awsome show!  It is not a DVD set  you will only watch once, you will watch it over and over.  I own the first season and love watching it everytime that I have time to watch it.  The weekly mysteries keep you interested, and the overall mystery keeps you wanting to know what happened!
1401307450|5.0|\\"Scar Tissue\\" covers the life of Anthony Kiedis from birth to 2004.  It gives a first person look at the \\"Sex, drugs, and rock n' roll\\" lifestyle that was such a large part of Anthony's life for so many years.  Along the way you learn about the people, places, and things that inspired the music of the Peppers as well as a detailed picture of what life as a drug addict is like.  The book is written very well and it never seems like co-author Larry Sloman was part of the story.  You definitely need to read this book.
0679745203|5.0|This novel is (forgive me for a regrettably trite analogy), like rich chocolate cake. It can either be devoured with a fiery voracity or savoured for its intricate nuances, and, in fact, should be read in both ways. The extremely complex and suggestive web of motifs present in Ondaatje's masterful work makes this novel tasty and satisfying the second and even third time through. I have heard it criticized for excessive sentimentality and romanticism, but that is exactly what is needed in response to the desolate emotional wasteland of a post-war world. Additionally, the end of the novel, I think, might disabuse many cold cynics of such notions. In any case, a striking, artistic masterpiece that would be a disgrace to overlook.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Born in 1985, I didn't really grow up in any of the \\"classic rock\\" music genres that are so endearing (such as Carole King) save for the disposable bubblegum pop boom of the late 90s and early 2000s that hit radio in my early Junior High years.  But somehow, being my parents had a plethora of a CD/tape collection around containing an array of artist from Carole King to Bette Midler, from The Beatles to Judy Collins and Joan Baez, I had the opportunity to hear an amazing kalaidescope of genres from talented singer/songwriters from their growing-up era of the late 60s to 70s.  Carole King's \\"It's Too Late,\\" \\"I Feel the Earth Move,\\" etc. all appealed to me, as did most of the records produced by the aforementioned soloists or acts stated above, so I decided to get the CD as part of my renewed interest in the classic rock/folk movement.  Something about listening to this type of music really makes me feel fuzzy inside, even though it was mostly 30+ years before my time; these songs remain timeless, ageless and completely enthralling despite their years, and I am extremely thankful to have had parents that played these types of CDs early on in my childhood because as an aspiring singer myself I have true \\"artists\\" that inspired me that I can look up to.
078322740X|5.0|Hawn and Martin are such a great acting pair. This movie will really make you laugh and cry.
1400034779|5.0|I read a lot of reviews of this book that state how gentle and harmoneous it is and it certainly has that dimension too. But I think we could view this book in a slightly different perspective if we were aware of a few facts about Botswana that I think might inform our understanding: <br /> <br />++The HIV/AIDS infection rate in Botswana is at 37.3% of the adult population as of 2003 (image every third person you know is either HIV positive or has AIDS), exascerbated by migrant labor - the disease carries an enormous taboo - not generally discussed. <br />++Because of this life expectancy at birth dropped from 65 to 39 years <br />++on every day of the year one woman is raped every 12 minutes (either within or outside marriage) <br />++domestic violence is grossly underreported but recognised by the government as a huge problem - men view it in general as their duty to discipline their wives - a quarter to half of all women are abused by their husbands, 60% of all Botswana women experienced gender violence in the last 5 years. <br />++sexual harassment of girls often starts in grade school <br /> <br />How likely is it that Precious Ramotswe would be HIV positive by the time she lost her baby? <br /> <br />Each of the above points is hinted at in the book and this did not make it light reading for me.  The worst part was that it was hinted at so casually, so matter of factly, as if it was nothing to be concerned about.  That's why I found it a most disturbing book. <br /> <br />A couple of websites that might interest you: <br /> <br />[...] <br />[...] <br />
B00004Y6NV|5.0|This album  by Dire Straits is one that will go on and on.  It will always be timely. The music genre is varied and fits all tastes.
0553801503|4.0|To state it fairly, this book is exactly what was promised: half a book. It half-satisfied me, half-engaged me, and told only half the tale. Whereas in his past books, events moved with impossible speed, taking me off guard, this installment slows down far too much. In many ways, it seems as if nothing happened, almost as if most of it was fluff to fill out an unfinished book. Additionally, it involved far too many cliff-hanger chapters ensconced in a cliff-hanger novel. In my opinion, it is effective to use mystery to draw the reader along, but in this, I had lost interest in the mystery (or forgotten it completely) by the time the plot came around to cast light on some shadowed areas. I think this has proved to be one of the weaker books in the series. Of course, perhaps I was merely bored because it had left out the larger portion of the characters I find most interesting. In any case, this is still a fairly good book, but it was not read-your-eyes-out, pageturner, stay-up-'til-four-am good. Just a fair warning. Then again, if you've already read the first three books, I dare say nothing could deter you from the fourth, so perhaps I am babbling to deaf ears (or blind eyes if you prefer, though that WOULD be rather ill-suited to reading these novels in the first place).
0743454537|5.0|You'll need a box of tissues while reading this book. Jodi Picoult tells the tale from various character's perspectives and incites feelings of guilt, loyalty, betrayal, misunderstanding, family and living. Take nothing for granted as she shares with you the troubles and hardships of a family who has more.
B00068CVJ4|5.0|This is the best cd by one of the best bands of all time. If you don't own this cd then you are wasting your time.  I was rather offended by the original information staying they were like U2, who is a horrible musical group and not even near to being anything like At The Drive-In, or being like white trash rap or rap rock like Korn or Limp Bizkit. I think anyone who has heard At The Drive-In realizes there is no similarity. At The Drive-In= Amazing....
0788815490|4.0|Good subject, the workings of a devious female mind.  A complicated love triangle.  Superb acting.
B00005JOII|4.0|By not casting himself (or a thinly veiled version of himself) in the film, setting the film in London (instead of the usual New York) and casting hotties Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johanson in the leads, Woody Allen has managed to create something I've never seen before ... a sexy Woody Allen film. Intelligent, engrossing and watchable, \\"Match Point\\" is also a somber, thoughtful film about luck, ambition, class and attraction. My only complaint is how similar the plot is to one of the storylines in Allen's \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\". But I guess if you're going to plagarize somebody, it might as well be yourself.
B00007KQA3|5.0|I have \\"The Book\\", the audio cd and recently got the DVD. The movie is a great adaptation of the book and puts good faces and settings in your mind when you re-visit the book.  You can tell that the movie was inspired by a person who really has the feel of the story.  You can actually feel the chill in the air when you watch this. It's a little spendy but the DVD is rare and well worth the money, especially for any die hard Orwell fan.

Unfortunately, she would never live to see it nor would anyone in her family but her father.

B000687M48|1.0|First my sister buys the recorded crap, then she gets the same crap live with a cover so bad that I lost any and all respect I had for the band. The cover, Thoughtless by Korn, should be avoided at all costs. You are supposed to do covers because you respect a band, NOT because you want to kill everyone's eardrums! Unless you want the same crap you already payed for and a horrible cover, run away.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|My first Michael Buble Cd and I loved it!  I've been hearing his stuff on the radio and just had to own something by him.  I can't say he's as good as Harry Connick, but buble has a nice voice and it's great to hear newcomers singing the old standards and the like, in this day and age.  Recommended.

B00080Z53O|5.0|The story of a man who due to an accident has remained fixed to a bed for 28 years, asking for the right to put an end in his life, is extremely moving and thought provoking. Bardem gives a magnificent performance of his role and so does the director with his excellent movement of the camera. I was particularly impressed by the confrontation of the two men on wheelchairs, arguing for their different views of life! The young nephew of the central hero (Ramon) gives also the most moving scene of the film, near the end. A must see!

B0007XT87G|5.0|Deadwing comes highly anticipated by new Porcupine Tree fans (like myself) who fell over themselves gushing about In Absentia. A close examination of PT's back catalog reveals that we really had no chance of getting IA part 2, however, as Wilson & Co will do their very best never to make the same album twice. Living up to the expectation of the unexpected, Porcupine Tree has put out a dark, raw album that follows up on their previous work while cutting new territory. At first, this might be offputting to the In Absentia crew, but over time Deadwing grows on you and reveals itself as another great album. <br /> <br />Deadwing's title track is a quick, rhythmic romp that sets the tone for the album beautifully. It's aggressive and forceful, with a propulsive beat and plenty of time for the band to wander from heavy to soft. After that comes the raw, almost AC/DC-esque Shallow, which is a pretty basic hard rocker with a killer guitar hook. Lazarus is the opposite pole - a spacy piano-driven ballad, given the unique Porcupine Tree touch as always. By the time we reach Halo, the sound of the album has become pretty clear. The bobbing bass beat, quick drumming, and bitter sarcasm of Wilson's lyrics keep the dark mood intact while allowing for a cool guitar freak-out from guest musician Adrian Belew (of King Crimson). The midpoint track, Arriving Somewhere But Not Here, is the unquestioned highlight of the album, as it moves over its course from a barely-there electro atmosphere to an inventive guitar lick to a keyboard-heavy verse. Lyrics like \\"Did you ever imagine the last thing you'd hear as you're fading out was a song\\" are among Wilson's best, and while the sparse vocals take a break the song goes through a rollicking instrumental section that features Porcupine Tree's absolute heaviest, rockin'est riff ever before moving back into the powerful verse.  <br /> <br />After that highlight, it's hard to go anywhere, and the band tries to ease the intensity level down. Mellotron Scratch does a good job of easing the mood as its calm but still rhythmic acoustic guitars turn down the volume while keeping up the pace. Open Car's beginning section is a misstep, but by the time it reaches the chorus and bridge sections this becomes a good track as well. Start of Something Beautiful is another spacier piece with some of the weirdness that made 90s PT so distinctive, and Glass Arm Shattering's fuzzy bass chords and washes of lush keyboard sound make for a suitably chilling conclusion to the album proper. Finally, after 6 minutes of silence, a bonus version of Shesmovedon is included with Mikael Akerfeldt of Opeth on backup vocals. Other than that this track is not sufficiently different from the Lightbulb Sun version to merit much comment. <br /> <br />In sum, Deadwing is a whole new beast, but still one that can't quite live up to its predecessor. It has a powerful concept, a new production approach, and enough guitar and vocal hooks to keep you spinning the disc over and over. Its problem, ultimately, is that on a track-for-track basis In Absentia simply has a few songs that make it a better album. Other than that, it's a dead heat. If you have one, get the other. Strongly recommended. Highlight tracks: Deadwing, Lazarus, Arriving Somewhere But Not Here.

B000E1155E|5.0|This album is fresh, fast-paced and a job well-done. One of the bests bands to come around in a while. Creative lyrics, and \\"Mardy Bum\\" has to be one of the best songs I've ever heard (that's saying alot). <br /> <br />Our generation that has been drowned in a bunch of garbage really needed a band like Arctic Monkeys to create an album that would help shape our music resume for the better. <br />
6305807086|5.0|One inventive scene follows another in this dark comedy from writer Charlie Kaufman and Director Jonze. For a few glosious years in the late nineties, Hollywood was informed by the spirit of independent films. This was one of the top results.<br /><br />So, yes: if you often use the phrase \\"weird\\" to describe people, films, music, etc., this might not be your bag.<br /><br />Craig Swartz (Cusack) is a talented but unappreciated puppeteer who is forced to take a job filing in an office. He soon makes two discoveries that become intertwined: that he is smitten with the brassy and cruel Maxine, who works his building; and that, hidden behind a file cabinet, his office contains a portal into in the mind of actor John Malkovich. Those who enter the portal see and feel everything John does for 15 minutes, before being ejected onto the Jersey Turnpike. Maxine decides that she and Craig should exploit the portal, charging $200 per \\"ride.\\" Meanwhile, Craig's wife (Diaz) gets addicted to the portal, decides she is a trans-sexual, and also falls in love with Maxine.<br /><br />Yes, it sounds crazy, and it is; but the script and the director manage to make it work. The film is funny both in the traditional sense, with clever dialogue and semi-normal situations; but hilarious in the I-can't-believe-these-guys-thought-of-this sense. Furthermore, the unusual circumstances of the story make it engrossing, since it is literally impossible to predict what might happen next. This truly makes for an adventure in film-watching.
B000000W5L|3.0|Get real people. Tumblin Dice is the last great Stones song but what else is there really?  If any of these songs were classic the Stones would still be playing them which they rarely do. Mick doesn't even care for Tumblin Dice. I consider this unreasonable overrating to be the White Album syndrome.  Give people a double album and they automatically think it must be twice as good. Exile isn't the embarassment that the White Album was but truth be told, your local bar band could probably play a set of original songs and come out sounding as good as Exile on Main Street.

0780628551|2.0|A beautiful young woman suspects that her astronaut husband might have been radically altered by an in flight astronaut. His partner has a suicidal freak-out, and so does his partner's wife. She learns that she is pregnant and so the stakes increase. Ultimately, a desperate ex-CIA man struggles to spill the beans to her. Will he make it? Will she?<br /><br />There is suspense in this suspense/sci-fi film; unfortunately, it is unintentional. It consists in wondering when the film is going to get suspenseful. We know everything from the get-go. We know what the husband's secret is, and we know the wife will eventually find out. The only possible pay-off is that the director makes what happens, when Theron's character finally figures it out, interesting. Unfortunately, she only finds out for sure about an hour and a half into a film well shy of two hours. How interesting could the remainder be? You do the math.<br /><br />I absolutely adore watching Charlize Theron, both for her obvious charisma, as well as her genuine dramatic ability. How she got sucked into this piece of dreck might serve as a lesson for her. It is certainly a mystery to me why a woman who could snag roles in \\"Celebrity\\" and \\"Cider House Rules\\" would select this script. Perhaps she felt she could save it, since the entire focus is on her character. She did not. The script and the direction made it simply impossible. Even a true Theron fan, like myself, will be sorely let down ( even more so for Depp fans, of which I am not one.)
B00000293E|3.0|Probably more interesting for who he is, rather than the music itself.  There isn't a song on this recording that isn't done better elsewhere - but Willie wrote 'em and adds his own style and emphasis to each one.  The backing is by un-named session players who deliver stock riffs, for the most part.  I agree with another reviewer that the harp playing is really good, though I disagree on the piano playing, which comes off as tinkly and pedestrian.  Willie is best on \\"Back Door Man\\", on which he really rips and which fits his voice to a \\"T\\".  It's worth the price for that tune alone.  The best-balanced song might be \\"Seventh Son\\", with a really nice shuffle/swing to it.  I was particularly disappointed in \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" and \\"Little Red Rooster\\", but given recordings of the original artists (the tunes given to them BY Willie), the bar was pretty high.

B0000029GA|5.0|The title of my review is a joke, of course, but this debut album from Nas is one of the best albums of all time, in any musical genre. Illmatic is one of the most influential rap albums of all time and is a timeless classic. This album spawned a generation of copy-cat MC's who tried to emulate Nas' style and flow; needless to say, they failed miserably. The year was 1994 when this gem was released and hip hop was in its \\"golden age\\" (1992-1996), with classic albums being dropped by Tupac, Wu Tang, Mobb Deep and others.  The wise sages of hip hop agree that Illmatic has to be regarded as one of the top five best albums in hip hop history. I always listen to this album whenever I think about all the mainstream crap that is inundating record stores these days where style is emphasized over substance. True hip hop heads recognize that the lyrics on Illmatic cannot be touched!  If you don't already have this classic album, drive immediately over to the record store and pick it up! <br /> <br />Peace!
B00003CXCT|5.0|\\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\" is the best movie of all time, in my opinion.  Even though the special effects are a little outdated, it still rocks, even to this very day.  Despite the changes (which I don't think are so bad [heck, we never would have seen the scene with Han Solo and Jabba if not for the changes]), it started the entire phenomenon.  As for \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", it revealed a truth unimaginable at the time.  That scene between Vader and Luke set up \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" to be a great movie.  And even though \\"Return of the Jedi\\" has an ending a little anti-climactic compared to the prequels, it is still such a great ending to the entire series.  All in all, the best movie trilogy of all time.

B000ASATWQ|4.0|I've gone back to edit my review of this album. I would change it to 5 stars if I could.    There are 4 - 6 songs on this album that are absolutely amazing.  They start with the thumping \\"Welcome to Jamrock.\\" Then there's \\"All Night,\\" with the old school roots groove and even smoother vocals.  \\"Hey Girl\\" is immediately catchy and just gets better. \\"Road to Zion\\" could easily be the best on the album.  I love Marley's delivery so much on these tunes that I often fast-forward through the chorus just to hear him do the next verse, building as he goes, switching it up.  His hip-hop like rhythmic vocals flow better than anyone I hear these days.    But I find his faster dancehall tunes lacking.  The best dancehall vocalists can deliver with a nice rhythm or flow that Jr. Gong lacks.  He sounds too monotonous, like a machine gun, opposite of how rhythmically he sings in the above songs.  However, those songs are few (3?) which means the majority are either good or great.    And it goes without saying that the lyrics are so kynd.  Can't wait for the next one, Damian!

0780021967|4.0|British film director Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps is a significant piece of cinema history for several reasons. It is generally considered to be his first spy-chase suspense-thriller, a genre he would return to, successfully, time and again throughout his motion picture career, most notably with Carey Grant in North by Northwest. More importantly however it was his first movie to find success among American audiences. More importantly however The 39 Steps would be his first movie to find success among American audiences. Few of his earlier black-and-white silent features made their way to American movie theatres and those that did, among them the sound-version of Blackmail, were dismal failures in terms of box office revenue. With the success of The 39 Steps he was at long last able to successfully make a name for himself in the United States. This in turn peeked the interest of studio executives searching for fresh talent and vision within the motion picture industry, although it would be several more years before he actually filmed his first American film. In part to this film he was able to achieve a level of success and acclaim he would never have been able to acquire simply a successful film director in England. <br /> <br />Based on the novel of the same name by Scottish author John Buchanan, Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 feature film adaptation bears little resemblance to its source. For one thing, the title, The Thirty-Nine Steps, is an allusion in the novel to physical steps along the coastline of Kent, England. In the film however they are instead used as a reference to the conspiratorial organization plotting an assassination attempts on a governmental official of a foreign nation. Another critical alteration from the novel is the character of Pamela who serves as a love interest to the hero of the picture, Robert Hannay. Pamela, or, more importantly, no love interest for that matter, exists in Buchanan's The Thirty-Nine Steps. Her inclusion then significantly alters the theme of the story from an intense spy-thriller into a light-hearted yet still captivating romance. Literary purists will undoubtedly disapprove of such revisions but Hitchcock and playwright Charles Bennett actually strengthen Buchanan's rather sluggish (at least as far as the middle section is concerned) novel. However, reaction may not have been as reputable as it was if it were not for the mesmerizing chemistry exuded between Robert Donat and Madeline Carroll. Audiences instantly notice a spark between the two from the moment they first encounter each other. In order to achieve such an effect, Hitchcock reportedly chose to film the handcuff scene first. After he had shackled the two together, he pretended to lose the keys which allowed the actors to feel each other emotionally and make their roles are the more believable and coherent. <br /> <br />The most striking transitional sequence in the film, arguably one of the more fascinating of his early career, is the scream of the chambermaid as she discovers the body of Annabelle in Hannay's flat seamlessly transforming into the screeching whistle of a moving train. A brilliant example of director Alfred Hitchcock's continuing apt experimentation with the blending of sounds and images. Such an effect would often be replicated throughout cinema history, most recently in director Steven Spielberg's The Lost World in 1997. <br /> <br />A perpetual theme in The 39 Steps is the sexually-frustrating institution of marriage, a motif Hitchcock would return to on numerous occasions later in his career. Although this argument can be assigned toward all three examples in the film, including the `professor' and his wife and the innkeepers, its authentication is shown through the shotgun marriage of Margaret and her abusive Calvinist crofter husband, John. Hannay and the audience take pity in the young girl who longs for freedom outside the shackled confinement of her maligning home. This can't be exemplified anybetter then through her hanging onto every word Hannay speaks in regards to his journeys in London and Montreal. Both enjoy each other's company, no more so then Margaret who is trapped in an unhappy marriage with no sign of escape. Her vehemence to help Hannay in his hour of need without so much as a question in regards to his true identity or his innocence in the crime he is implicated in demonstrates her thirst for company. <br /> <br />While Donat plays the character off mainly for laughs (the scene in which he quickly improvises a speech introducing a candidate for British Parliament, having no knowledge about either the candidate or the politics of Britain, is one of Donat's more memorable moments in the film), he is easily able to slip in and out of reflective consciousness without offsetting the flow of the picture or the intensity of the drama which unfolds before our eyes as the story draws to a close. <br /> <br />It is a bit difficult today to take Lucie Mannheim's Miss Annabelle Smith seriously, partly because of her heavy foreign accent, a clich which has become a staple of parodies of spy films. Nonetheless, interactive dialogue between her and Robert Hannay and the character's own mannerisms are pure Hitchcock spy-thriller material. In the aftermath of the mass confusion at the music hall, she begs Hannay to accompany him to his bachelor flat apartment. Slyly, almost prophetic really, he responds, \\"It's your funeral\\". Dark Hitchcockian humor at its best. In yet another example of Hitchcock cruel irony, the scene in which Smith collapses on Hannay's bed as he lay in it with a knife stabbed in her back shows that she was killed with the same kitchen knife Hannay used to cut her last meal just a few short hours ago. <br /> <br />The scene in which Richard Hannay remembers the tune which had been stuck in his head for the past two days (this of course being the musical accompaniment for Mr. Memory's act) is one of brilliant craftsmanship on the part ofthe director Alfred Hitchcock. The composition reveals that there were no papers missing from the Air Ministry in regards to their top secret weapon because Mr. Memory, an agent of the 39 Steps, memorized every single word of the document and kept the valuable information inside his head, leaving no incriminating evidence which would point toward him or the secret organization he worked for. It was almost the perfect crime. Sadly, Mr. Memory, a man `doomed by his own sense of duty' as the famous director himself once put it, can not help but uphold his reputation as a cistern of information, whether it be trivial or valued. So when Hannay, being dragged from the theatre by the police who have finally caught up with him after his escape from the police station, shouts, \\"What are the Thirty-Nine Steps? Come on! Answer up! What are the Thirty-Nine Steps?\\" he hesitantly but accurately answers the question, or at least he tries to before the `professor' who had been lying in wait in the balcony to take Mr. Memory to the home base of the secret organization shoots him and attempts to flee the scene before being cornered by the police. As Mr. Memory lays dying on the floor, having just gotten the secret information he `stole' from the Air Ministry off his mind at long last, in the foreground Hannay and Pamela hold hands, this time voluntarily (laughably as the handcuffs still tangle from Hannay's wrist), as in the background chorus-line dancers kick to the tune of `Tinkle, Tinkle, Tinkle' on the air. Easily one of the director's most captivating and elaborately complex scenes in his distinguished career.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|This is the collection for nostalgia buffs and those who revel in those wonderful days of yesteryear when music was memorable (AND hummable), and the lyrics were similarly crafted.

B000060OFT|5.0|You'll love it or hate it. <br /> <br />Personally, I found it deliriously enthralling! Brilliantly ambitious in art direction, and more authentic in it's portrayal of anguished teenage romance than any other version. A sweet sound track doesn't hurt! <br /> <br />If you can't appreciate Shakespeare and highbrow art-flicks, you're not going to appreciate the faithful dialogue and lovely little double entendres. If you don't dig over the top, two fisted Hong Kong fire fights, you'll be nauseated by the gorgeous excess. <br /> <br />But if you're lucky enough to enjoy both, I guarantee this gem will pack more punch than Romeo's .45!  <br /> <br />I never appreciated the source material more. For something completely different, but equally brilliant, don't miss Kenneth Branaugh's Henry V.

B00009RDGA|5.0|Adapted from Joe David Brown's Addie Pray, Paper Moon is the story of grifter Moses Pray, who offers to take orphaned Addie Loggins to her aunt for the express purpose of squeezing some money out of the man responsible for the death of her mother. But Addie is no sweet little child; she's a pragmatist who overhears the money deal and wants the bucks for herself. So Addie and Moze travel the prairie (changed from the Alabama of the novel) in a story filmed in gritty black and white, buncoing innocent shopgirls and making their living. A particularly humorous interlude comes when Moze is captivated by a hoochie-coochie dancer, played con brio by the marvelous Madeline Kahn and offers her and her maid a ride. Addie and \\"Trixie Delight's\\" maid Imogene bring the interlude to a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />The only trouble with Paper Moon was that they never filmed the second half of the book; I think O'Neal and O'Neal could have done it justice (but I'm glad they didn't do it if they were going to cast Mae West--ugh!--as Amelia Sass). If you like the movie, read the book--it's excellent; a lot more details of Addie and Moze's escapades!
0452270073|4.0|Pat Barker's novel details the real-life encounter of the WW1 poet Siegfried Sassoon and the psychiatrist William Rivers in Craiglockhart Hospital for officers suffering from mental trauma as a result of their experience in the trenches. Sassoon, a decorated hero, is saner than most and certainly no coward, but he has published a declaration denouncing the war, which presents a problem to the government. It is Rivers' job to persuade him to go back to France, but he is also acutely aware of the risk of destroying his patient's individuality in so doing. Although the horrors of trench warfare are always there in the background, the author's sympathetic treatment of the leading characters is such as to make it very pleasant to spend time in their company, and it is only towards the end that the novel fully generates the moral force promised by its theme.<br /><br />Perhaps I was conditioned to respond in a certain way to this book. As an Englishman of a certain generation, the dialogue and texture of the writing was warmly familiar. As an English major, I was absorbed by Pat Barker's treatment of Sassoon's process of distilling his experience into poetry; although he was already known to me, the book made me think of him even more highly, and likewise his contemporary Wilfred Owen, who also appears as a character. A further personal factor is that my own father, like Sassoon, similarly served as a lieutenant in the trenches; he was similarly decorated and I think similarly traumatized. This book makes me wish that I had been able to ask, and he to talk, about the events that clearly destroyed even the survivors of an entire generation.<br /><br />There is horror in the book for certain, but its greatest effects, like those of the War itself, linger on in the souls of the men who are supposedly out of it. Nothing that Pat Barker descibes of trench warfare come close in immediacy to what I consider the masterpiece of the genre, Sebastian Faulks' [[ASIN:0679776818 BIRDSONG]]. And by far the most horrific chapter in the book is a so-called medical treatment by a sadistic (and also real-life) London psychologist called Yealland, which is the diametric opposite to the humane methods employed by Rivers, who is a thoroughly admirable and complex individual. So admirable, in fact, that Sassoon feels guilty after a while for spending months among gentlemen in comparative luxury while his men are being slaughtered in France. This reader felt a bit the same: caught up in an easy and even rather escapist read, pondering issues in a somewhat hypothetical way, while the real conflicts are occurring elsewhere. This impression is increased by the more perfunctory treatment of the lesser characters (as other reviewers have observed), who seem to come more from a Masterpiece Theatre script than from real life.<br /><br />All the same, the questions that are posed in the last third of the book have significant gravity, and I look forward to reading the two succeeding novels in the trilogy, [[ASIN:0452272726 THE EYE IN THE DOOR]] and THE GHOST ROAD, to see whether their weight is allowed to build cumulatively from here on out.*<br /><br />*[Later: I have now read all three books, and though I found them all interesting, I felt that the special quality given by the narrower focus of REGENERATION got lost when Pat Barker expanded the canvas. See my review of [[ASIN:0452276721 THE GHOST ROAD]].]the most horrific chapter in the book is a so-called medical treatment by a sadistic (and also real-life) London psychologist called Yealland, which is the diametric opposite to the humane methods employed by Rivers, who is a thoroughly admirable and complex individual.

B00008WG3U|5.0|One thing's for sure about NOFX, every album they put out just seems to have a life all it's own... Whether they be dabbling in Ska, reggae, lounge or Jazz... the lifesblood of every one of their efforts is all Punk Rock at it's finest. In fact, with the exception of \\"Liberal Animation\\" and \\"Maximum Rock and Roll\\", every one of their albums so far have been not only listenable, but have set the standard for modern punk, period... Seemingly in a league all their own, they have matured into the band they will be from here on out.  Personally, I find the band to be just as appealing to my musical tastes today as they we're 10 years ago when I started listening to them. Of course my opinion may be a bit biased considering that along with the Ramones, NOFX have been my favorite band for years... But regardless, this is an awesome album, I suggest it to anyone who's a NOFX fan or just a punk fan in general!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is the best Sci-Fi and Western I've seen in a long while (it has many elements found in westerns).  A crackin' good story, great dialog, and excellent special effects.  I saw the TV series on DVD and loved it (so did my wife) so we naturally wanted to see the movie.  You can see the movie without seeing the TV series, but I think it would make the movie more enjoyable.  The movies does all the things you can do on the big screen but are limited to on TV.  Again, a great sci-fi movie - and one of the best movies, period, that I've seen in 2005.

And as you know, the real \\"freaks\\"  were the criminals out to hurt them.  I loved this movie because I think it really showed them with a sense of normalcy.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Long time has passed since I first heard this amazing music from a Broadway show that dared to be different. Ten years, in fact. In that time, our world has become a much different place; harsher, more scary, less tolerant in many ways. And all of that just makes Rent more relevant and more real, and speaks to us just as strongly as ever.<br /><br />Rent is the story of a group of artisians and visionaries, stuck in dire circumstances, struggling to make their mark in the world before the world makes its mark on them. Mark, a filmmaker, lives with Roger, a musician, in a rundown building in New York's Lower East Side. Mimi, a girl who lives below the pair falls madly in love with Roger. Collins, a friend and former roommate, meets Angel, a drummer drag queen, after getting bashed. Lawyer Joanne's on again, off again relationship with her sensuous partner Maureen, a performance artist, flows with the story.<br /><br />Together, these people make Rent. Each person strivse to fulfill their life's desires, but like the visionary opening scene, their dreams quickly turn to ash as they pitch them out the windows in fiery blazes as reality sets in. The story dares to suggest we must strive daily towards our goals, for we may not have a tomorrow to depend on.<br /><br />But Rent is so much more than story, it's the music. Songs brought over from the stage show are intact and beautiful. The powerhouse \\"Rent\\" opening number is equally as thrilling on celluloid. Angel and Collins' romp in \\"I'll Cover You\\" is powerfully joyful; as powerfully sad as its reprise at the funeral in the second half of the movie. La Vie Boheme is amazing; energetic, fun, and it makes you want to get up and dance. Songs missing from the musical do not leave gaps at all in the movie (well, perhaps one... \\"Goodbye Love).<br /><br />The performances in the movie are rich. Portrayed by many of the originial cast members, who bring with them memories of Rent's early days, they each have a depth to their characters that communicates worlds just in a glance or a smile. Anthony Rapp's Mark look when he first meets Joanne is classic. Adam Pascal's \\"Light My Candle\\" is rich, sexy, and daring. Idina brings such humor and energy to her \\"Over the Moon\\" segment. Wilson Jermaine Heredia shines in Angel's \\"Today for You\\", and Jesse L. Martin steals the movie in his powerful \\"I'll Cover You\\" refrain. Newcomers Tracie Thoms as Joanne and Rosario Dawson each hold their own in the new group.<br /><br />The DVD brings two discs; the first, the movie with director's commentary. The second brings a powerful documentary on the life of Jonathan Larson. This documentary traces out the development of Larson's career, tragically cut short from his death just as Rent was going to take off. A very moving part of the documentary is a tribute to Larson's friends, Gordon, Allie, and Pam, who are mentioned in Rent.<br /><br />In retrospect, this just isn't a film, this is history. Chris Columbus has now captured on film orginial perfomances of an amazing musical. In a hundred years, when they are studying the devleopment of musical theater, they'll have this film to look back on to remember these moments. Jonathan Larson's gift to the world was the musical Rent. We now have this film to celebrate it; and celebrate, we shall.o their characters that communicates worlds just in a glance or a smile.

B00005Q4CS|2.0|To all the fan boys that love this movie, check this page daily and rate 1 star reviews as unhelpful, I say get a life. Stop watching this nonsense and telling the rest of us how great this misery is. This depressingly bleak melodrama is what IFC and Sundance continue to peddle and why nobody cares about independent films.  If you like to wallow in misery, and see the horrors of drug addiction gone wrong, this one is for you.  Graphic, brutal, and you tend to feel like the victim of a crime after watching.  A friend who suggested this one on movie night has now lost the right to do so in the future.  This film was just mean spirited, depressing, and unnecessary.  I will never be able to watch a film with Jennifer Connelly and not get upset again.  If a movie has anything to do with people destroying their lives over substance, they tend to be mean spirited by nature.  If you enjoyed this nightmare, go watch Rush.  You'll like it too.  If you don't enjoy being depressed and watching the horrors of drug addiction gone awry, look elsewhere for your entertainment.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry is one of the best books that someone could read.  It really brings about what life would be like if everything were the same.  I feel that memories are one of the strongest ideas that keep us alive.  We feed off them everyday; I know for me, I think about things that have happened in the past at least once a day.   <br /> This book reflects on daily life where there is no violence, no mystery, no content within their lives what so ever.  All the adults have an assigned job, the kids have assigned playtime, there are no cars and there are no memories of the past.  To me, I feel that they live a very boring life.  Even with all the problems that we have in today's society, I think that we wouldn't have any excitement. <br />by: ARC Quaboag Regional High School <br />
B00003CXC6|5.0|Quaint and to the point(even for Kurosawa). The basic idea is deceit and how a story can be manipulated. A film like this must be seen for the simple fact that it draws the audience into the story with every possible element. The acting aspect though theatrically hoaky which is typical of most early Japanese works can be amusing. Yet at the same time when it counts the acting is bang on, even by westernized popcorn flick standards. Until the end we are told how to think in various different ways, and though debatable as a sufficient conclusion; in my opinion we have an opinion and thats more than enough. Kurosawa gave us a choice and with a choice to judge we must relate to our own lives for experience. To give the audience the ability to relate keeps them in the story even when they leave the theater.
B000004286|5.0|If you enjoy music that plays straight through to the emotions, then this soundtrack is for you. Since it is a motion picture soundtrack, you can expect to hear various versions of the same musical theme, but the music is so beautiful, it shouldn't annoy you. I highly recommend this CD.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|First, I thought the movie was wonderful. As a result I developed an affection and connection to the use of the music throughout the CD from the movie. I highly recommend its puchase for anyone who developed a similar connection to the film.

B00005QGAV|4.0|\\"Dangerous\\" was Michael Jackson's follow-up to 1987's \\"Bad\\", and much in music had changed from that time. Michael was right there to take it up a few notches. From driving dance pop, R&B, and even hard rock, Michael shows us his diverse talents. He shows us how he can attempt almost anything and make it work. The mastering touches of Quincy Jones are missed here, but Teddy Riley does a nice job of giving us the \\"New Jack\\" sound so evident in 1991-92. The album had another typical MJ run, as well, kicking out hits for nearly 2 years. The only factor that dogs down \\"Dangerous\\" would have to be the lack of consistency and the filler cuts, which didn't or barely existed on MJ's previous 3 releases.
0060899190|5.0|I sat down and read this book and by the time I finished reading it, I was in tears. Some were because things were so funny I cried, and some were because they were heartbreaking, and some were tears because I had secrets identical to theirs. I told everyone I knew about this book, and to start sending in their secrets, if they even still can.
B000301YY8|5.0|I have a blog on the popular MySpace where members routinely add new music to their profile page. One of my friends had a song by James Blunt. It stopped me in my tracks. I next listened to more of his songs on his profile page on the site, googled him and learned that this was his first CD. He was compared to Damien Rice and Elton John, both of whom I love. After I sampled the songs here at Amazon, I knew I had to have the CD. It certainly didn't disappoint me. The songs are consistently top dollar and this singer deserves the awards I hear he's recently been given. Tears and Rain is one of my favorites.
0143036556|4.0|I must confess that I did not read Diamond's earlier work, GG&S.  I decided to purchase Collapse after hearing Diamond speak, and I was not disappointed.  Don't be put off by the thickness of this tome; Collapse is one of those rare finds--a non-fiction page-turner.<br /><br />That Diamond is an environmentalist is a given, but he is remarkably thoughtful and well-balanced as he examines the issue of societal decline from many angles.  He never comes across as shrill or condescending, a tall order for most opinionated scientists.  (I know, I am one)  Although the author is not a sociologist, I felt that his takes on possible societal motivations for \\"choosing\\" to fail or succeed were plausible.<br /><br />The reason Diamond is only getting 4 stars is that I felt that he was stretching his analogies a bit as he scoured the globe for examples that would fit his five-point model.  That, and the narrative began to drag somewhere in the midsection.  Overall, though, the prose was quite well done and even entertaining to read.<br /><br />Note to people of faith:  Yes, in the back section of the book there is a reference to \\"population control.\\"  I know that this very controversial topic is the main reason that Christians have been so hesitant to jump on the environmental bandwagon.  Even so, I truly hope that common ground can be found because in truth there IS quite a bit of common ground to find.  It is possible to be \\"green\\" without being in the \\"cull the human herd\\" camp.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I bought this for my 2 year old daughter. She loves it. There are so many new movies I think we lose site of the classics. It may be old to me, but it is new to her. I have caught her singing along with the songs.  <br />It is great!
0316666343|4.0|Lovely bones is a story about a girl who is raped and killed by a next store neighbor. This starts to tear apart the family, because of the lose of their daughter. Thought the daughter know exactly who had done it she is in heaven now and can not communicated with her family down on earth to tell them what had happen.  <br /> <br />I really did not have a favorite part of this story I really just liked the whole book. I liked how it taught was that even if you know everyone in your neighborhood they could still hurt you. Another part that I liked was when the girl always is watching out for her family even thought she can not communicated with them she is still watching out for them and making sure that they are ok. Those were some of my favorite parts in the book.  <br /> <br />This book was a good book, and it is a great read for people whom like murder or mystery story. This book makes me think about how I might now a person but I really don't know them even if I think that I do because some people can be nice but than they really are not. This book helps me to watch out for people like the Mr. Havery who can really hurt you and take away your life. This book also shows me that I should not take my life for granted because it could be gone like that. This book was a great book and a really good read.      <br />
0451169514|5.0|I just reread It (I read it about nine years ago) and was happily reminded of what a kick-ass, frightening book this is! Stephen King writes a compelling story of a town called Derry, that is pretty much evil to the core. The only ones who can stop It (an evil entity that can make itself look like anything but is often seen as Pennywise the evil dancing clown) from continuing to kill and mutilate children in Derry are seven outcasts. The book flips from the seven's childhood and first time fighting It in 1958, to their return to Derry twenty-seven years later when the killings start again. This book is very creepy and has some of the more chilling scenes I've ever read (the opening with the demise of Georgie still gives me goosebumps). However more importantly it is a story about the bonds of friendship and the power that seven outcasts have. It is a great story about childhoods horror and the difficulty people have growing up. I loved this book nine years ago and I love it today. The only con (and why it got 4 instead of 5 stars) is that at times it can be a little slow going and maybe just a tad too detailed. But that only adds to the depth of all the characters. But when King wants to scare ya it's full speed ahead! If you have the time to invest in a long book (paperback 1090pgs) you should read this one. It's classic King horror and classic King story-telling.
0812550706|3.0|Have you ever come across a book and thought, \\"I'm not alone\\"? That was my response to this book, and I have a feeling many had this response, proven by its popularity. <br />I was a loner. I was misunderstood. I struggled. Some adults saw my potential. I saw myself in Ender.  <br /> <br />If I had not identified with Ender so much, I likely would not have liked the book, even with the game room and battle room. <br />Liking a book is partially based on similarities or differences, good or bad, that the reader has with the author. It started with little things in the first book, but then in the sequels it really came out, that the author and I have differences that would make it difficult for us to have much of a conversation about anything that matters.

B00004U2GH|4.0|I loved the performance by Johnny but it was some of the other acts that were luke warm. Over all a good view, but if you have more DVD's of Johnny, you probably have seen the songs he sings in this version.
B0000027RL|5.0|Ten was the other album, along with Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" that summed up the latter half of the final pre-Internet slacker generation.<br /><br />The energy and emotion of this album is unfocused angst, but poetic, beautiful in its way of musically describing frustration.  The lyrics are detached, distant, unrevealing thought forms that form a puzzle that most listeners instinctively can identify with.<br /><br />This is Eddie Vedder's \\"Led Zeppelin IV.\\"  After the first year it was released, I ignored this album because I could not stand the hit song \\"Even Flow.\\"  When I finally listened to the entire album, I realized that \\"Even Flow\\" was the only bad song but when listening to \\"even\\" that song, when taken in context with the rest of the songs, it was even brilliant.<br /><br />I'm not going to give you a song by song analysis.  Every song is perfect from start to finish.  The ordering is perfect and there are barely breaks in between songs.<br /><br />I'd say that this album should be in Rolling Stones Magazine's 100 most important albums in the history of Rock'n'Roll.

B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah Carey to me has had the most remarkable come back in the whole music industry of my time. \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" has not only the best selling album of 2005 but also won three Grammy's! I have this album on my ipod and my day wouldn't be complete without listening to the tunes of \\"We belong together, or Shake it off\\". I also think the track with Snoop \\"Say Somethin'\\" is something I can listen to everyday as well. Mariah has shocked her fans and critics with the tracks and lyrics on this album. Everyone knows they can't say one negative thing about her talent and angelic voice. I have become a huge Mariah fan because of this album. She really has killed the game with \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\".
B000B5XOXY|2.0|This is the first Batman movie of the '90s to shy away from Tim Burton's Dark Knight Returns-inspired gothic vision. Schumacher lacks either Burton's sense of visual flare or his ability to turn completely unrealistic situations into absorbing viewing. The movie would have been much better had a director more in Burton's mold been responsible for it. Unfortunately Schumacher is not that man, and that shows in spades. Potentially sympathetic villain Two Face is reduced to schlock (without even getting a well-developed origin story) while the Riddler--a maniacal villain known for his obsession with his own intelligence--is too jerky and overdone to be taken seriously. As for defenders of this movie who claim it made more money than Tim Burton's Batmans, it comes in second in terms of gross profit, but when one adjusts that for inflation, it finishes well behind Batman and a few million behind Batman Returns. (The increase in ticket prices over the years between those movies and that one, of course, had nothing to do with its relatively strong showing, I'm sure.) In any event, this movie is the second-worst of the Batman movies that have come out since the late '80s. If you want good Batman movies, either check out Tim Burton's pair, Batman Begins, or the animated movies made over the course of the last 15 years. They're infinitely better than this.
0783232039|2.0|1st of all: This is not even a horror movie - 2nd of all: If you hide Tilly's face, she's hot.<br /><br />The addition of Chucky's bride is very stupid, but the way she dies is fun. The other 3 Chucky movies were nice, but this one and Seed Of Chucky were made just because there were no more stories, but the way they decided to continue the history was very, very bad. The special effects are just bad, the ending is the worst ending they could have made to end this \\"horror\\" movie, that is nothing but a stupid comedy movie.<br /><br />If you still haven't watched this, don't do it and keep away from this...
B000B8QEZG|5.0|If you like pop music that is not too cheesy, this is an album for you.

There's more important things than hearing you speak.\\" And, there are many more on this album that make the catchy tunes even worthier. Check it out!

The story is great about people living with AIDS and other dramatic features while living in the the poor streets of new york. The songs are great from Season's of love, Out tonight to amny others. The movie doserved more then it got int he theaters. The film si great and is one of the best muscales ever.

B000002L80|3.0|After their debut album, the Talking Heads began building music of excess-- extra musicians, layered instrumental arrangement, polyrhythms, and so on, driven on by David Byrne's sort of all-accepting view of music and in part fueled by Brian Eno's production wizardry.  After an album that was more electronic then organic (\\"Speaking in Tongues\\"), the Talking Heads did a complete about face with \\"Little Creatures\\", presenting an album of essentially stripped down pop music. <br /> <br />Now granted, stripped down pop is not a bad thing-- it's just that the band appears to have surrendered their edge along with their heavy production.  While the music manages to reclaim a bit of that timeless quality that made the first four Talking Heads albums so great, the music is lacking.  From my perspective, I suspect it's because it's a lot more restrained-- the instrumental arrangements are a lot less edgy and Byrne's vocals fall in a comfortable middle range tenor rather than his usual higher, tense vocal. <br /> <br />Truthfully, none of it is BAD-- it's all pretty enough pop music (\\"Perfect World\\"), and the reflections on children on sweet and often quite clever-- albeit goofy (\\"Creatures of Love\\", \\"Stay Up Late\\"), and certainly there's no question that opener \\"And She Was\\" was destined to be a hit-- it's a great piece with a fantastic hook and a great vocal harmony on the chorus.  It's just that most of the pieces are pretty much undistinguished (\\"Walk it Down\\"), and the Talking Heads were never about undistinguished songs. <br /> <br />This album, along with the rest of the band's catalog, was just released in dualdisc format.  The remastering makes that version far more desirable as it sounds fantastic and is worth the extra cost. <br /> <br />Trutfully, had a band other than Talking Heads put this out, I'd probably rate this higher, but the bar was set pretty high by \\"Fear of Music\\" and \\"Remain in Light\\".

B00005JOFO|5.0|Its been so long since I've gone to the movie theater<br /><br />and been challanged by a movie like brokeback mountain.<br /><br />This movie is so well made by todays standards. Its so<br /><br />visual and beautiful, the directing, acting, music, cinematography, pace, all flow together to create magic.<br /><br />The short story by annie proulx and the adapted screenplay<br /><br />by Diana obssana and larry mcmurtry is fine tuned, slowly paced so<br /><br />that director ang lee finds all the space he needs to tell<br /><br />this tragic love story.  I just got blown away by all the many heartbreaking performances, thats why I go to the movies to<br /><br />see acting, this is a drama not an action flic, you don't see acting this good in a movie by its entire cast.  ang lee did a fantastic job with each actor, they gave their best, heath<br /><br />ledger,  Jake gyllenhaal, michelle williams & ann hathaway.<br /><br />A movie with such depth about a subject that still seems<br /><br />to bring out the best and worst in americans.  Its sad to<br /><br />read so many hateful reviews, many by people who haven't even gone to see it.  Even sadder is to watch the way<br /><br />its being made fun of, but it's the overwelming postive<br /><br />reception this movie has acheived that can never be<br /><br />taken away.  It may have lost the oscar to \\"Crash\\" for best<br /><br />picture but all those reasons aside,<br /><br />its  a movie that will live a long time and in the hearts<br /><br />of people for years to come.  America may never agree on<br /><br />this whole gay issue, but all citizens in this country<br /><br />deserve respect and a voice and story to be told.  I can't remember when a movie<br /><br />has sparked so much debate and that is the best thing<br /><br />that could have come from this.
0679422714|5.0|This is a terrific book for exposing all of Mao's brutality in rising to power and maintaining his power after becoming head of China's Communist Party.  The authors have documented the real story of Mao, as opposed to the sanitized version put out by writers such as Edgar Snow who lionized Mao and whitewashed his crimes, just as so many intellectuals did about Josef Stalin.   <br /> <br />Anyone with a serious interest in twentieth century Chinese history must read this book.
B00005LMBK|5.0|That was a bad pun.  Don't make a monkey out of me!  Gorillaz offer a unique musical flavor that grows on you.  Even if you don't like it at first, give it another try.<br /><br />I hated them at first, but the more I listen, the more I love it.
630460291X|5.0|This movie has been a favorite of mine for many years.  I am a huge fan of Kevin Costner also.  Everyone knows the story of Robin Hood, so I won't go much into that, but this movie portrays it the best and has great acting.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I'm straight.  I don't have AIDS.  Heck, I'm a Christian.  But I have a heart, I have a soul, and thus, I can't rate this DVD as anything but wonderful.  The beauty of Rent, to me, is that it does an amazing job of showing that people who live \\"alternate\\" lifestyles are not some monsters, as many in the world would have us believe.  Instead, they are PEOPLE.  They have the same hopes, dreams, loves, and pains that everyone else has.  The hatred around homosexuals, trans-gendered people, and other \\"alternative\\" living people is such a joke, such a horrible thing, and this movie helps to show why that is.   <br /> <br />When I see a work such as this, it helps to remind me that not everyone is as narrow-minded as Rev. Phelps and his crew.  Movies like this give me hope that one day, we will all live together in love.
6305428050|5.0|I've loved this movie since I was little.  The story is great, and super funny, and any person could watch it.  Only thing to look out for is some language.  But other than that it can be enjoyed by anyone.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I personally loved this movie. I loved its (perhaps inappropriate) use of Bronte-esque scenery, its earthiness, the boisterous country life of the Bennett family...I loved it all. I realize that the costuming and manners were not quite right for the period. In my opinion the heart of the story survives despite the film's nonconformity to these restrictions. I thought the acting was wonderful, particularly that of Kiera Knightley. Donald Sutherland made me cry. The music was lovely, the cinematography lush and sweeping. There is an unabashed romance to this film that is truly rare in movies today.<br /><br />Is it faithful to the book? No. But then, film is a completely different medium. A good film is not simply the source material (book) with pictures. It involves first the author, then the director, then the actors, art director, cinematographer and so on and so on. All of these people have their own visions to realize. It's a collaborative effort. Jane Austen's original vision is interpreted anew.<br /><br />I loved the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version, but isn't there room for more than one interpretation? Many are acting like Joe Wright stole Pride and Prejudice. If you don't like it, then there's no reason to ever watch it again. Pretend it never happened. I understand. Honest. I won't ever again watch the William Hurt/Charlotte Gainsbourg version of Jane Eyre, but I'm over it. I have a choice- to watch or not to watch. I've made mine.
