B00DJ3ITKS|5.0|I am a customer since 1997. No interruption. Books, cd's and now from Kindle to vitamins. The book is written in a magnificient way and the story...a blast.
B00C061I1M|4.0|Valerie June has an intriguing voice...really, I've never heard anything quite like it. I really DO like this album, but I have to admit that I must be in the right mood to listen to it. I absolutely LOVE &#34;You Can't Be Told&#34;, and I guess that I wish there were more songs like that. Songs that kind of rock and have swagger! A song, like&#34;Shotgun&#34; is so incredibly stark and depressing that I was actually sort of shocked by it.<br />  I do love the Black Key's production, which is  apparent through out.  There's something about her voice that makes you want to find out more about HER, because the influences seem to come from  all over the place, in  fascinating kind of way!
B000002IZ4|5.0|I must say this easily stands next to Pearl Jam Ten as one of the most defining albums of the 90s.
B0073XSVVW|5.0|Well, Things have certainly come a long way since Revell initially released a 1:32 scale Bf-109F/G way back in the 1960s.  Very revolutionary for the times, with some fine recessed rivet detail that remains unmatched to this day.  The inaccuracies of this vintage kit have been beaten to death by now, but the finished model actually did look like the Augsburg Eagle.  Now, some 45 years later, Revell Germany has taken the bull by the horns to produce the definitive Gustav.<br /><br />Dimensionally, this kit is spot-on (the earlier Revell kt was a scale 1 foot too short in the aft fuselage).  Very clever engineering of the parts, so expect a &#34;fat tire&#34; version to come out later.  Can be built as the standard G-6 with heavily framed canopy, or updated with the &#34;Galland Haube&#34; and tall wooden vertical fin.  Nice 300-litre drop tank, but no other underwing stores.  Cockpit detail needs very little improving, although the Fine Molds Luftwaffe seatbelts in soft, positionable ABS plastic would be a nice touch to replace the molded-in seatbelts and harness straps.  The fuel line on the right side of the cockpit is molded in clear plastic to allow the sight glass to be depicted.  Some small glitches:  MG-131 cowl bulges are undersized and without the &#34;flange&#34;.  Ironically the parts that came with the 1969 Revell 109G are much better, and could be substituted.  Also, the front edge of the supercharger intake is a bit to sharp and should be replaced by an aftermarket resin piece.  Spinner join line is also in the wrong place and needs careful finishing, especially if you want the &#34;burbelschnauze&#34; spiral motif.<br /><br />Now, what I consider to be the second-best feature of this kit: The price!  At well under $30 retail, this is a real bargain when you consider that the new Tamiya 1:32 F-4U Corsair sells for over 6 times that much.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  John Beaman, eat your liver!
B005ONTD42|5.0|Just purchased Sphero 1.0 - at $75 I thought it was a great value and holiday present. Can't go wrong with a robot ball for uniqueness!
0802473156|5.0|Read this years back just wanted my own copy!  Enjoyed reading it the first time and picked up a few things this time.<br />The book was sent and rec'd  before date given.
B00EP0SIOG|5.0|As a happy original Sphero 1.0 I was really excited for this new product. The new Sphero is faster and they've really refined driving. Also love that you can buy a nubby cover for it to protect the shell. It's a very unique well made toy, which is something you just don't see these days.
B005K17RU0|5.0|As of now I would give this app five stars. All the problems I noted in my earlier review have have been corrected. I run three weather apps in my Galaxy Note mobile phone and my tablet. This one is the best of the three and does exactly what a weather app should do. If there's a better weather app out there I'm not aware of it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|start playing fast and its fun too.<br />easy to get addicted. lots of hunting scenes and areas to go hunting in.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app is a combination of fun and puzzle learning! I mean I'm only on level 29 and some people are at level 263 or something but its really fun GO LEMONADE LAKE!!!!! THATS THE LEVEL IM ON!!!!! anyways get this app its awesome and FREE
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I downloaded this game and my son loves it. Easy to play and it keeps you busy.<br />I also enjoy helping him with the game.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Played at a friend's house and decided to buy for my nieces and nephews for Christmas.  Fun for kids and adults.  Your strategy will develop after 2-3 games and then people get serious!
B001LF4IA6|5.0|Very, very underrated. Bruce Springsteen has never made a bad album, this is a lot better than 95% of music that is being put out nowadays. This is a great modern rock and roll album. Period.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series is well written and engaging. I couldn't put it down! Highly recommended.  I cant wait to start the shift series.
006202406X|5.0|Allegiant was a beautiful conclusion to the trilogy.<br /><br />Veronica Roth does an excellent job building the world seen in this book. She also further explains many of the decisions and events that took place in the previous two books. There is a lot of well done character development, as one might expect since the book is from two different points of view. It is worth mentioning that the difference between Tris' voice and Tobias' voice is not obvious and if you put the book down in the middle of a chapter you might forget who is speaking. However, both points of view are essential to the story and are entertaining. Some people might think the book is slower than Divergent and Insurgent, but I didn't find that to be the case. Allegiant, as I said, focuses on building the scenes and explaining the events and might not be as action-filled as the first two books, but it is by no means slow.<br /><br />I will say that I wasn't as emotionally invested in the book until the end. I found myself just reading so I would know what happens, and because I was already previously invested in the characters. However, when I reread the book I found myself enthralled. Perhaps I was just feeling out of it when I first read the book.<br /><br />The end of the book was spectacular. I did not find the ending predictable, or in any other way wanting. It is not what I imagined, and I was caught off guard, but it is a suitable ending and one that I am comfortable with. The epilogue especially tied up all the loose ends for me and felt like a very solid ending.<br /><br />I was satisfied with Allegiant. Veronica Roth took some risks, and in my opinion it paid off. I will definitely read whatever she writes next.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first two books, I would recommend Allegiant. Overall, the series is one of my favorite to return to. I can't wait to reread them all!
B00G6ZTM3Y|4.0|I like this game it is worth the money but I wish online was better and that that it is pretty hard to find ion but overall the game is good fyi very addictive
B0017APPSE|5.0|The movie is excellent.  The blu-ray is exactly as described, New in Package. The price is great as well. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the renaissance type movies.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|DO NOT GET THIS GAME.The first time I downloaded this game IT WOULD NOT EVEN WORK.PS. DO NOT GET THE GAME. IT IS A PIECE OF S###.IF I WERE YOU I WOULD NOT GET THIS PIECE OF JUNK.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham has the ability to bare our souls in his stories.  We see the horror of evil and the beauty of the human spirit, and all the while we can't put this book down because his characters have become people you know and you must see how justice woks out.
B0060D123K|5.0|This is a wonderful Christmas movie, especially if you are watching with a young one who might be scared by the ghosts in more serious productions.  My only complaint is a couple of musical numbers were cut out of this edition.  Had I realized that I would have searched for an uncut version.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|I think the humanity in the character of this Superman makes him my favorite. For me it made the whole movie more real
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Good read. Good reminder and plot outlining how heroes fight insurmountable odds and risk themselves for right to triumph over wrong.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Story has really slowed down. Was picking up the pace at the end, which ended too soon. Not sure I'll continue to read the series
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|What more can I say other than it's John Grisham at his usual best.  Great story telling, characterization. I wish I could find more books that left me feeling so satisfied.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Loved it! I know this book is for Tweens but at 68 years old it was like eating candy. Am already on my 4th book in the series & can't wait for the movie.
B004UID2LC|1.0|It freezes up, doesn't let you watch videos half of the time, and doesn't do anything productive. Don't waste your time buying this app.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is one of the most useful gear I bought in this year. Why? most of the low light situation I encounter is indoor, and pretty much in all indoor situation you bounce the flash on ceiling. There is a saying, the most important feature of a camera is to HAVE IT WITH YOU. I guess that is true for all photography equipment. Most full size flashes are too heavy for me, I cannot carry them around. Compare to full size flash this is a humble little jewel that works when needed. It covers 75% of my use cases. Of course it cannot replace a full size flash. But certainly it can reduce the usage of a full size flash. I carry it all the time with me.<br /><br />You need fill flash under harsh light, it works great.<br />You need bounce flash, it works great.<br />You need little more than pop-up flash, it works great.<br /><br />You need a replacement for SB-900, sorry you need to look somewhere else. It cannot replace a full size flash.
B0085OEIOC|5.0|Classic ZAZ. This movie is, how do you say, indispensable? Worthy successor to Airplane. Oscar-caliber performance from Mel Torme. Kudos!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's an AMZING book THT will keep you at the edge of your seat. Peeta is sexy. I recommend 10/10
B007FG9LIE|4.0|An enjoyable journey! Would recommend to fans of post-apocalyptic lit. Looking forward to reading #2 in the series! End took an interesting spin I didn't predict!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it so addictive! At this rate I hope I never finish! It seems to never end! And if you are patient........ no money spent!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft is great for kids under thirteen because you get to learn how to build at a young age.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|This is my all time favorite 80's movie. It continues to help me appreciate persons with disabilities in every area of life...
B004742Y68|4.0|Poltergeist holds up very well over time, still creepy, still scary and the message of love and hop still rings true today.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|This is a good song.  The download was fast and there were no issues in the quality for this product.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|Works flawlessly and it cost nothing at all. The colors are dazzling and the choices just what I was looking for
B00ERH15WY|4.0|Bit of a strange one this. I think on the whole the song selection is bang on - it's great to see BR covering the more traditional Christmas carols rather than Christmas pop, and on the whole they work very well, much better than I expected for sure. Personally for me White Christmas and Little Drummer Boy are the only 2 songs on the album I find myself skipping, not because they are bad, but again as others have mentioned they interrupt the flow of the album.<br /><br />The only real let down for me is the inclusion of another version of American Jesus which in my opinion is unneeded and doesn't add anything to the album, and the exclusion of The First Noel and Silent Night and Frosty The Snowman, all of which BR have covered at some point in the last 3 decades.<br /><br />All in all a really good effort for a great cause, recommended.
B00ENYLECC|5.0|Excellent movie and a wonderful (if not a little fantastical) version of schizophrenia. Used this for my pysch class to have students see what a schizophrenics mind can be like.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|I knew the Seals' training was tough, but I had no idea all they go through. Great information. The only negative to me was the profanity.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I played the original CastleVille on FB, it got boring fast and the challenges were no fun to complete. This edition makes it more self reliant and a lot more fun.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Love it. I wish it wasn't as laggy and you didn't have to wait for it to recharge. But the gameplay is nice. Like the unlocks between console and app.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I could not put I town. Great book. It brings to life the poor treatment slaves were given and to think that society accepted it for so long is scary.
B002WIDRM6|2.0|I have seen LA on TV and liked what i heard so i bought this cd and was not that pleased felt the production was lacking i did borrow there first cd from my library and was really pleased with what i heard so this one is not a winner in my book .
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Interesting way to learn how to operate these weapons. It is easier than getting hold of the real ones. Having used some of the firearms in real life I can say the app does a good job showing the operation of the firearms.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I did not think there would be a book that captured my heart as much as Eleanor and Park did, but Rainbow caught me off guard with Fangirl. It was pure perfection. I instantly became attached to the characters. The book stirred more emotion in me than anything else has. I was unable to put the book down until I finished. Absolutely everyone should read all three  of Rainbow Rowell's books!
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|I was really satisfied! We're the Millers I thought was a great ADULT funny movie I would definitely rent it again!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just the right amount of difficulty when you want to kill some time. Sometimes you want to have fun playing without to much challenge.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|Keeps u wanting to keep on reading to find out who? As always keeps you enthralled. A few surprises thrown I. To keep you guessing.
B00FGJNS72|4.0|Nice to be able to write up documents on my kindle but I've run into some problems emailing through the app itself.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I play it every day but their os something that i don't like it won't always upgrade when i want it to.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The author blends together a wide ranging medley of characters and southern small town citizens into plot that leads to a believable and satisfying conclusion. Lots of legal practice and maneuvering is included in the story but it never overwhelms the core narrative concerning people, their attitudes and relationships.
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|As some have pointed out, this is a fairly good movie although it is difficult to understand how it won so many awards and received such acclaim.<br />Perhaps it is the politics of Hollywood that helped this film win so many awards.<br />Perhaps the most dissapointing aspect of the the film is how some viewers may be misled to think this is an accurate telling of the Canadian Caper.<br />Yes, being a movie it is understood that some creative license will be used, but as far as historically accurate, ARGO is loosely, loosely based on real events.<br />2 big historical errors - The 6 escapees were never in great risk where they were hiding. They were in a relatively safe home with access to an outdoor courtyard and when they actually went to fly out of the country, no Iran security even gave them a second look.<br />Ben Affleck's character in real life was actually only in Iran for about 1 day as an assistant to the Canadian Ambasador.<br />The Canadians actually spearheaded most of this mission, but the movie makes it look like it was a super secret CIA led operation.<br /><br />So it one watches the movie and keeps in mind it is loosely, loosely, loosely based on real events and is not an attempt to tell a historically accurate version of what happened, it is entertaining
B0083Z614S|4.0|Reminds me of Heidi.  Nice story with predictable ending.  Good story for 5/6 graders especially girls.  Written years ago but still enjoyable
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This is a very interesting story. I love the characters, setting, and the author's creative way with words. I've never read a book from death's point of view. I read so many books it's hard to find one that can surprise and delight with its uniqueness. The only drawback is the blasphemy. Seems like the author could have been creative enough to find other words to use when characters curse. This is supposed to be a book young adults can read. Because of the blaspheme, which the author himself refers to in the book, I cannot recommend this book to my students.
B0037UUZQY|5.0|The face is not as in the cartoon unfortunately, but seems a little bit as Rapunzel.<br />The same as in the picture and very nice! The packaging is also nice and suitable for present. I'm very happy and sure it will be a good surprise for New Year for my daughter.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book. I loved and loathed some of the characters. My attention never wandered. Am thirsty for more!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I cried all the way through this book. It is amazing. I hope the movie is as good. I never had this attachment to a book as I did with this one.
B000C25VNM|5.0|I love finding a signed copy of this book.  The dust jacket has a tear, as indicated, but otherwise the book is in excellent condition.  I love her illustrations!
B00005AREQ|5.0|JEFF BECK's best CD ever!! This is the first Jeff Beck music I heard and I was hooked! I love this CD and recommednd to anyone who love good guitar music.
B005NPBT5M|3.0|While this album has all of the songs from the original, the remaster does not flow as smoothly as the original. With the original album songs flowed into the next in classic Pink Floyd fashion.
B0012GMZDG|5.0|One of the best Jeff Beck to date! Blow By Blow is my very favorite! I like &#34;Wired&#34; & &#34;Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop&#34;, but this one rates way up there with &#34;Blow By Blow&#34;!! Get this one, you'll be glad you did.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|It has been some time since I have not wanted a book to end.  This book is a treasure to read, drawing the reader in to stay. Works on so many levels, it is hard to describe. Highly recommend.
B000I5X81A|3.0|I was a bit disappointed in this CD. I love Clapton's music and have a lot of it. This CD has a couple of good songs, but it has some rather bad ones as well. It's the first time I've heard Clapton play a country song. This is NOT the Clapton we've come to know & love.
B0089LOG02|3.0|The plot was a little pat and use of language was not particularly elegant.  It was an enjoyable read though.
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|Great movie. Very funny - be sure to watch the out takes at the end.  Jennifer Aniston shows increased depth.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Great start for the reboot! Newbies and Classic Who fans can both fall into the reboot of Doctor Who. Well worth your time!
B0001I55OC|4.0|The Goonies - the director Richard Donner described the cast members in the special features, that was funny. You hug one, you have to hug all of them.  If one cries, all cry.  The movie's plot is great-it's about going to the past in 1357 to save Chris' s father who was trapped and he did not have a marker to get back home, so Chris and a group archaeologists go thru a wormhole to rescue their professor from medieval France in the middle of a battle.  It's a really good movie if you like medieval fight scenes.  Regina.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|From the opening paragraphs to the final sentence, Mitch Albom captured my heart, mind and soul forcing me to rethink the concept of time and it's value.  What a lovely read with a poignant message.  Treat yourself to this treasure - your life will never be the same.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|Love Johnson & Diesel in this movie.  Nice cars and good looking people go together, but the plot is realistic in our life and I really like with this movie.  It is not a good idea to drive really fast, but who does not like speed.  Regina.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The characters in this book came to life on every page. Everyone has secrets they keep and I loved the way these secrets fell into place in this story.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I enjoyed the movie a great real.  It reminder me of the first characters  a lot even thought the new actors are different in their own, they still brought a presence that made me smile.  I have enjoyed action and marital arts movies from the day I saw Bruce Lee and Star Trex in the early 80's.  Thank you.  Regina.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is the best Grisham book yet! I absolutely loved it. Totally engrossing up to the very last page. Beautifully developed characters. I was recommending this book to friends long before I even finished it.
B008JFUPFI|4.0|I was born in the late 60's so my am some what nostalgic,  however, the director's vision really impressed me with the way the movie was presented to us (the audience).  I enjoyed it.  Regina.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|I totally love his books.  The only problem is he does not write fast enough.  I would read one of his all the time if I could---super author!!!!!!!
B000099T2L|4.0|The cd is the bomb.  I will always enjoy listening to this cd.  Beyonce is a great singer and dancer.  I cannot dance like that.  If I try I will hurt my back, so I will leave it to her to continue to entertain.  Thanks again.  Regina.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Really like this game but it takes too long to earn money and there is not enough storage space without paying for it...
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Lady Gaga is the real deal.<br /><br />APPLAUSE allows her to not just satisfy the need of her fans but spread an important message about celebrity and fame. She's about the art yet able to gain the applause she deserves from her fans and the attention from her detractors as well. You can't fake what she is able to do in a song. She makes you watch, she makes you wonder and at the end of the day you're waiting to see what she does next.<br /><br />APPLAUSE is not just a testament to her gift. It is a statement that you will celebrate her and all she brings to music.
1439170916|5.0|Great book on the history of cancer.  I would think it would interest anyone, since nearly everyone seems to have cancer, or know someone who has or has had it.  It does make you frustrated at how long and tedious the search for treatments is, but at least you get an idea about some of the obstacles are.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Loved playing the game, love army games. Game keeps moving at a steady pace, WW2 time frame, graphics are great also.<br />Yeah, Id recommend it.
1577314808|5.0|This book can change your life. Scan through it then read it again and work the exercises...take your time, you'll be amazed.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Common...Jennifer Lawrence is in the film, how can it be bad? That girl can act. She could stand and read the phone book for 2 hours and I'd still watch the movie 100 times. Plus, she's HOT. That being said, the movies' story line was a different slant on other movies from the deep dark film history past that had futuristic games to stay alive as its story line.<br />Nice seeing Donald Sutherland working again besides doing voice overs on orange juice commercials.<br /><br />And WOODY!!!!! Who doesn't love Woody? Apparently, not his real life father, but thats another story. Woody makes the part of the Lovable Lush nice to watch.<br /><br />Cant wait to see HG's 2. Did I say Jen is Hot?
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Cornwell never disappoints. Another amazing scarpetta novel! Keeps you interested from the first chapter. Would definitely recommend to others loving a good mystery.
B000QRIGLC|3.0|Opened my eyes to the reality of the seals beyond the usual tales of their intense training.  Worth every minute.
B00GURT0OE|5.0|Ultimate &#34;feel good&#34; song!  &#34;Happy&#34; has some awesone lyrics which makes this a good song to start off your day!
0143034901|5.0|What a fantastic book! I could not put it down. Our book club chose this book as the first book we read, and we all loved it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a beautiful book that deals with heavy subject matter with grace, humility and a large shot of reality. I really enjoyed it and could not put it down. It's the fastest I've read a book in a long while. Looking forward to Losing Hope.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I like the templates that come with the purchase. I have started and finished projects excel and power point, and I also did some final edits in word for research paper.
B003Z0BWRM|2.0|I couldn't finish this one. I'm not a huge fan of cookie cutter characters, I need some flaws, some contradiction.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|What can I say? The Walking Dead is addictive because you come to really care about the characters.  Although very gorey and explicit, if you can get past the blood and guts, they do a fabulous job of developing the characters and their struggles as survivors.  It is a great statement on human behavior in a disaster and coping with desolation.  Can't get enough.
0761169431|5.0|This is a fun Origami book for beginners who love Star Wars. My grandson has just become interested in Origami and he had asked me for an Origami book. He is a Star Wars fan so when I found this I knew it was for him.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is like the most popular game in the world for me I love it when I am super bored if I were to  be you then I would like be so aimed cuz it is free everyone on my bus has this game and it I<br />Should not be free but if I were you then I would get it. Edit it is like 9.<br />99 dollars
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is so fun and addictive. I love the minions their so funny. I especially love the different areas to run. The only thing that gives this a a four star is because I don't how to earn more Gru money. Still really fun!!!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I love the new Trek movies.  The way it is presented allows non fans to start from the beginning and the fans of the original an alternate beginning.  This opens up possibilities for new non apocaliptic science fiction. Yay
B0076DELIG|5.0|So good.... You have to read all of the Harry Bosch novels......reading in order is best....  Good reading friends..these would make a great tv series.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|When Google Reader has finished its services, Feedly appeared to be a good alternative. Once using it, I just discovered a better App, very simple to use, user friendly and beautiful. With it, I can, easily, organize my RSS content, divide in folders (design, music, social media…). I  use the App on my laptop and iPhone. Now,  I am using on my Kindle Fire HD 7 and it works perfectly.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I avoided watching this for movie for a long time, presuming it to be just another senseless action film. Then I happened upon a New York Times article; \\"70 Reasons to Dislike the New Superman Movie.\\" This was my first indication that it might be worth watching. And indeed, it was. Of course, with Superman there are numerous parallels to the spiritual life; a father sending his son to save the world, to be the bridge between their world and ours. Sounds familiar indeed. And in fact, the director (Snyder) intentionally played up these parallels between Superman and Jesus Christ, even explicitly stating such in the \\"Special Features\\" of the DVD. This approach, I think, produced a well crafted movie.<br /><br />It is always beautiful to see great strength joined to great humility in one person. The greatest figures in history share this trait, and Snyder was able to transfer this onscreen into the main character; a man of gentle and disciplined strength--far from today's emasculated male figure.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I wish I could have more than 5 lives at a time! plus some of the levels are so hard it makes me mad! but I keep playing it anyway.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Great Adaptation! Excellent Acting and smashing sceneries!  Gatsby comes to life with a first class interpretation of Leo Di Caprio!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I like this book! This is the best ever! I have never read a book like this before.<br />Thanks for the awesome book!
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I watched the progression of the relationship, until she was sure she wouldn't be hurt , and tested him in different ways
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing it lets me build the things I like,like houses and shops.....<br /><br />But I would think that we need minecraft pe to be like computer version with villagers and portals and stuff like that if u know what I mean?
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|I was never a fan til I heard the single (Hail to the King) which led me to buying this and subsequently, their prior 2 albums.<br />This is the record a band makes when they are ready to ascend to that &#34;next level&#34; after years of honing their craft.<br />This record is produced, written and mixed perfectly.<br />This is their &#34;Black Album&#34;, &#34;Reign in Blood&#34; or whatever you want to compare it too.<br />Hate them for whatever you feel you need to, but listen to this record and then tell me the riffs didn't have you throwing up the horns and banging the skull?
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is one of John Grisham's best! He connected it very well to his first novel, A Time To Kill.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Saw it coming,but still could not put it down. Spent the last few days with Grisham and loved it. He's my man.
B00138KFYO|4.0|If you liked Janis, you'll love this.  If not, go to Selena Gomez.  She is better looking but does not have the soul that Janis Joplin brought to a generation &#34;on the road&#34; to adulthood when the adults of the time were living their own &#34;naked lunch&#34;.  Unfortunately that buffet is still being served in Washington.

0783225881|2.0|I can certainly understand why anyone might be taken in by this movie.  I was, twice: when it appeared in theaters and again on  VHS. But after watching most of it on TV recently, I have to admit my error.  It was a lovely idea unrealized  -  corn both under- and over-cooked.  Kevin Costner's well-intentioned performance was undone either by his lack of acting chops or poor direction  -  probably both.  Amy Madigan was abrasive throughout.  The bonus/bogus characters played by Jones and Lancaster were more preposterous than the ballfield in (and of) the corn, and Lancaster's is actually embarrassing.  So we're left with Gaby Hoffmann, who, at the age of 7, could hardly be expected to save the movie, charming as she was.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Really good page turner. Quiet the twist! I always choose books that were recommended to me by friends. Glad I followed her advice!
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Nothing fancy about this case but its really handy. The tablet stays put regardless of what angle its set.  Just what I needed.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Very interesting and nice desk game. I and my friend almost play it everyday. This item is really quite good.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Great pop music, she have really outdone herself and everyone else. I always find myself playing this album in the gym, car, just EVERYWHERE.
B007CKX8GY|4.0|This is a painful book to read considering the vast poverty the author suffered but there is a light at the end of the dreary tunnel. I read this book years and years ago and yet still remember the feelings it brought up.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love this game I am addicted to this game. My friends daughter had got me addicted to this game... and now I am always playing it.
0061906220|5.0|Pete the cat is an amazing character and teaches such a wonderful lesson of letting life happen and going with the flow...great book!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I could not put it down it totally took over my life until I was done reading it.  Awesome book!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|If you want a fun easy way to learn a language this is it!  I am really learning Portuguese in just a short lesson a day.
B00F880BWG|4.0|Lot's of holes this season, or, at least, I'm noticing them more.  The sneaking up of growling Zombies always irritates me.  But I do like the concept and the show is well done overall.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is back to the old school basics that made him chart topping famous with this latest legal masterpeice.  I started losing interest with his latest books, especially the non legal ones and this one roped me right back in.  Its a great read and would highly recommend.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|The best app when you are bored and sitting on a chair the best app I've had yet out of all the apps
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this game is amazing I love is a bit laggy but still is awesome cool armor and great dialouge beef
B000OLGCI4|3.0|The movie itself was great! My daughter had never seen it but she laughed and was singing the songs  for days to come.However, it was missing my Disney Movie Rewards so that was a bummer.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I used to play Castleville and it just overwhelming but this works out so much better. Also I can play it on my Kindle Fire.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I thought this game was a challenging. and unique. game. I think my grandchildren. would have great fun with it.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|i love how school is out ,because just like Greg I love snow! it would be awesome to be able to play in 3 feet snow
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am enjoying the game very much. My daughter cant read well enough yet to follow the instructions for solo play. A few of the key game elements (how to train, where to find the button to pet your horse, etc.)  aren't intuitive to operate so I only gave 4 stars.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves these games! I've played/reviewed other games by 22learn and I've got to say the quality is consistent. Fun and adorable games at a reasonable price,trust me when I say that preschoolers get addicted to these games.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|The movie definitely doesn't cover some of the things in the book in the same way, or as I imagined them. But it's still a good adventure. Something I know I'll watch more than once.
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|Trance, progressive, techno, house;  DI.Fm has it all. I listen to this app daily. There are very few commercials on the free version. Almost none at all.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was very reluctant to read it because often the third book in a series is repetitive. This book was very entertaining with many new twists. Once I started reading I wanted to just keep reading to see what was going to happen next, especially at the end.
B00GIXCBRS|1.0|I searched this just to see what the reviews were like.  It baffles me that there are so many five and four star reviews.  It's perhaps better than the one star I hereby give it, but this movie really was pathetic and awful.  It was basically a cliche of the originals and felt almost like satire.  I saw it in the theater.  A considerable number of people booed at the end- though, reflecting the bizarre qualities of the movie, some people also clapped... :-?  There are naturally worse things to waste your time and money on, but this movie really did seem like some Hollywood joke where the producers sat around laughing, knowing that it was junk but would be commercially successful from the brand alone.
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|Great movie! Loved it. Really explains some of the dangers of social media and what entanglement people can get into.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its about time we got this game! It is an addictive and fun. Watch out; it will get difficult but you will get all kinds of cool power ups. An addictive experience!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|So far it's all good. Game runs smoothly. Easy to use. Big buttons to touch so you don't accidentally hit the wrong one (like other games like this one that I have played). I'm not that high of a level yet but I have managed to make more money every 30seconds than I spend to plant. Now the game is really starting to take off. I just wish I could play offline also. I think every game should allow you to play offline and just update whenever you connect to Wi-Fi again. One thing that made me really happy is once you connect to Facebook it will save your progress so if you delete it and reinstall it your place is saved or if you update your device to a new one you still got all your stuff once you connect it to Facebook on that device. That makes this app a keeper!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I GOT TO LEVEL 34 and could not continue unless I paid to get to the next levels.  I WASN't aware I had to pay to play.  I would rather have ads!
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is a perfect gamepad. Just like the one which came with the PS3. Pefect fit, works like a charm...
B004SKHJF2|3.0|I was very happy with the app until this last update that changed the look of it. You can't stop tagging a song when the song finishes like before and the look is not user friendly and it also says that it will get the tag when you get into service even though you're in service. Please change things or else I'm gonna start using Soundhound more than I am now.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Hilarious and poignant at the same time.  Definitely a modern look at family and relationships.  Well written and acted.  We plan to watch all of the other seasons after this.
B0017SWPXY|1.0|I didn't realize there would be soooo much talk about racing in this book...<br />Who would be the target audience?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series of books was so captivating, so deeply enthralling, I started to believe that I was Katniss Everdeen. I actually mourned when I finished book three. This series is amazing to say the least, and leaves you wanting more. I will always be a firm believer of \\"the book is always better than the movie.\\" And in this case, it's because Suzanne Collins does such an amazing job of putting you right in to Katniss' head that most of that emotion could never be justly put across on the big screen. No offense to Jennifer Lawrence, she's wonderful. I just don't think I can be done.
B007F5SG22|4.0|Ayaan's story has opened my eyes to a world that is completely unknown to me. The book has provided me with a wealth of knowledge about Islamic faith and other culture.<br />It is truly enlightening. I admire the vividness of her account of events. The book is well written and has shown a very admirable story of survival in the midst of adversity.<br />I am disappointed that Ayaan's has chosen to become an atheist. I hope she applies her critical thinking to explore the one true God, who is the creator of the universe, a loving God who blesses and protects His children- God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob- the one sent His son Jesus Christ to save the world.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The only thing I dislike about the book is that it is over!!!<br />I would highly recommend it to anybody!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This was great read. Getting to know Jake Brigance again was fun. Good sequel to my favorite Grisham novel &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loving it!  I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for season four!  Especially love seeing both sides of living at Downton Abbey
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I really like this app because it works very good with Kindle. The aiming is really good and graphics are awesome!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great series! Love the characters and the storyline!  Would watch it all in one seating if time allowed!  Can't wait to watch Season 3
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Awesome album! I love every single track of this CD for sure.Thank you for sending it.Keep up on good work.Good luck.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Loved this book...almost couldn't put it down, actually. It's a captivating look at Hitler's Germany from the eyes of Liesel. I wonder if the movie will be as fabulous?
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a very engaging book. You think you know, but then you don't. You can't put it down, really.
B007KFZ7RE|5.0|Retro 60's soul done right. Incredible touch and talent. Singing and guitar playing is completely dedicated and true to the era and is deceptively accomplished. As is the musical arrangement of these songs. This guy has it.
B00E95ED32|5.0|Avicii keeps astonishing the music world.  A real cross section of the music world.  Country, rock, and blues in electronic dance music.
B00EKR61FM|5.0|I do not mind paying for physical movies (dvd/bluray) if the packaging is nice. For the Twilight fans, this is a must have. All the movies are in this box set along with a special feature disc only available with this box.<br /><br />Get this if you like the movies and can appreciate the work that goes into the making the box.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Game with ps2 graphics(pretty good) and great features like free regions, and lots of guns, only some cost glu  credits, but this game is excellent compared to other you games if u like hunting!!! Again, excellent game,  RAINBOW UNICORNZ!!!
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|Took me three days to read the three books. Little to no character development. If you area  fourteen year old girl, this collection might be for you. About as compelling as Twilight...
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Traded in my candy crush saga addiction for a brand new bubble blaze addiction! Best bubble pop game by far!
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Sure was a lot about flowers!  Was a very good story about a life of child in group homes & how difficult that can be.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|One of the most original movies ever.  Hilarious! It pokes fun at our lazy society.  I never get tired of watching this.  Kids love it, but the real message is for adults
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is so fun but I just don't like the video that shows on. I saw that video a thousand times because I have the first one!!!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is another great book by John Grisham. From start to finish. Most intriguing. What a great ending!  Had to finish it before I could go to sleep.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|So much fun and time consuming but, Addictive. You won't want to put it away, it's that fun and interesting.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Pink Floyd at it best DVD production of it LIVE Concerts....especially the DARK SIDE OF THE MOON!!!! All I can say is ENJOY IT!!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It's a great game to play when your bored at home or in the car, and I like the way you can mod your weapon
B0085KGGHI|5.0|WOW!!! Awesome to see Muddy Waters performing live which way captured in good quality Video and sound. He is at his peak financially and doing what was  he loves doing is performing before a live audience. The Stones acknowledge that Muddy was the Father of Rock n Roll and Muddy stated that Rolling Stones are my SONS!!!! It was great to see the BLUES Legends performing with the Stones, it just phenomenal and I am glad that I will be watching this memorable performances until the end of my days.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy that this game is on the kindle fire. I always play this on my mom's I-phone so I was glad that candy crushes was available on Amazon.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Really fun and playable. I have played a ton since getting it.  Definitely  would recommend.<br />Cool graphics and visual. Good quality
B00CATSONE|5.0|It's an easy read & shows what a person can accomplish if they really want something & believe in themselves
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great device and ceap.  Love the integration between the Google products!  Very easy to use and setup. I use it with my phone, tablet and PC!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Easy reading and entertaining subject. Had read it as a younger person and wanted to re-visit prior to visiting Alaska.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|The design of the packaging is beyond cool and the quality is superb! Definitely a great Chrimakwanzakaa present. Do it!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a great game for people that like to hunt. I like this game because it has very very good graphics. Gator done
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Just a lot of space for a tablet nothing they can do about it though. All in all clean a crisp picture awesome game play
0446572985|5.0|Once more, Baldacci displays his richly laconic style in a complex yet masterfully crafted sequence of events. We know Will Robie's adventures simply must live on!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm 19 and I play this all  the time with my little cousins!!! They update it and it's not a waste. Something new all the time!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I'm just not much of a book reader. I know!!  I should be. But ... I'm just not. This one, however, was different. I couldn't put it down. Great read that kept me wanting more at the end of each chapter.
B000063Y8F|5.0|The best garlic press. Period. Cleans easily and is well-balanced to use. Good construction will probably help this press outlive me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Wow. Seriously people, this is a terrible book. What's all the  fuss about? I would like a refund  please. Awful
B007PKDW44|5.0|Fantastic album. With the exception of one track, this one i can listen to start to finish. If you like 80's metal give this on e a try and I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|I think the game should let you have more fights at a time other than that five star rating for me
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|probably one of the best apps out there. my 5 yearold nephew loves to play. with each update it just gets better. download. download now.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Well, as we all know the movie rocks, but the ease of of using amazon prime was great as well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very good for my reflexes and keeps my mind going. Enjoyable game, it keeps me on my toes. Sometimes my grandsons have to get me off one.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy of books was amazing it keeps you just wanting to keep turning the pages amazing awesome!! :) :)

B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love this game although some of the tiles are similar it can be hard when you are trying to beat your time.
B00170DEM8|5.0|Great dancing, great music and a great way to emerse yourself back in time and the romance and nostalgia of the another era. On my list of top Christmas movies.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book leaves me aching, wanting to cry, heartbroken that someone could lose so much. But she lives and still has someone who loves her with all his soul. And so there is hope.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love the Colors and the &quot;layers&quot; of the world.  I love the way you navigate through all of it.  The characters are well made.  Reminds me of a real life storybook.

0767817664|5.0|One of the best scary movies from the 80's, a decade which had a lot of really good scary movies. I watch it nearly every Halloween.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Amazing movie; It is worth it to watch it.  Denzel Washington is great in his role as the pilot of an airline company.  From the beginning to the end it captures your attention.  I was surprise with the end.
B00384UCBM|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I enjoy all the actors & actresses that star in it. Plus I love the thought of England for Christmas.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I Was Very Excited For This Book But Was Disappointed.  The Storyline Didn't Make Sense At Times And The Ending Was Strange.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|game has an interesting twist on game play to move a head. Reallylike different challenges. but not to keen on search of same items same locations. over all l like the game though would recommend. for other if u want to play over several days.
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|A great family movie! It's nice to be able to purchase a viewing of a movie from the comfort of your home.
B000QRIGLC|2.0|I really struggled with this book. I understand the sacrifice and commitment it takes to become a Navy SEAL and serve this country in some of the darkest corners of the earth. I know that I don't have what it takes to do the same. I figured there would be a healthy dose of chest-beating braggadocio, Texan pride and Jesus loving and told myself I could get past it and focus on this incredible story - but I didn't adequately prepare myself.<br /><br />It's funny, he says near the beginning of the book: &#34;I am not a political person&#34; but then proceeds to spend the entire book blaming liberals and the &#34;liberal media&#34; for his predicament. He praises George Bush and Rumsfeld as American heroes. I'm not even a liberal and it was all too much for me. He has such an alarmingly unsophisticated understanding of the wars he is fighting in that if I didn't already know other SEALs who are kind, humble, and intelligent - I would think that all American operators were simple-minded macho men.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can not wait to play more. Only three games in and hooked.Enjoy it, So addictive! If you like angry birds, you will love candy crush.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|British tv is always the greatest quality in acting and content.  I really feel I can identify with the people in the story which is nearly impossible with most American made tv.
0451419243|5.0|It's very engaging and very informative historically.  It's kind go hard to keep the characters straight, but there's a nice index in the front to refer to.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the best books that I have read in the last ten years. Almost believeable. had me cheering all the way.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|Crazy, fun movie to share with family during the holidays.  Not exactly like my family, but everyone can relate to some part of this film!
B000T433CO|4.0|This is a heartwarming movie about relationships!  Good story and I love seeing anything set in England!  You've got to see it.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|Fun movie!  Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds are great together.  Love the dance scenes with Betty White and Sandra Bullock!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is amazing but I would like it even more if you can sleep in creative mode and if you can explode TNT
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|In 3D this movie draws in crowds to an extraordinary world made by the best directors and producers in the industry.<br />Even If your not a fan of the original series this masterpiece will leave you in awe

B00AFROVQC|5.0|I could not put this book down. I can't wait to start book two to see where Thor' s adventures take him.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome but amazon still needs roblox bad ios has it and i think the kindle does to I mean my kids want it so bad.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|don't bother this app wouldn't let me download the app so mad..... I couldn't look at videos very well on my kindle so I want to show someone a video and it wouldn't let me install I'm mad:(
B00FLNQBTK|5.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious, my entire family loved it!!!!! This movie is so much fun you will be sad when it's over.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|The music is just incredible. The lyrics are mesmerizing and the rhythm is magical. This album is just out of this world!
B00G21XNKU|5.0|An all around great special! Great for fans and non fans alike. Acting almost like the usual episode, yet featuring a movie esque plot
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I was a little disappointed with the ending. I thought it would be a little more climactic since the build up was so great. I still recommend it as a good read to any Stephen King fan.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. The story line is good, graphics are great and overall the game is very addictive. highly recommended
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Wanted it mainly for spreadsheets,,,,works excellently with all the menu options that I needed to edit a file that I had transferred to my kindle. You can also create new files using the app....totally satisfied!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The moment i picked up this book i couldn't put it down! Yes ive watched the movies, so i know what is to come but this book it way better than the movies. It explains more in detail of everything that happens!!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I love this game challenging but fun good for ages 11-35 not for young kids or seniors have fun playing this thrilling game
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Read these books!  I strongly feel that everyone should read the original story before watching tv or movie variations in any book.  This is no exception.  Fantastic writing!!
159184617X|4.0|Regarding the current genre of books about Apple geniuses, just listen:  if you're very, very quiet, you can hear the backlash coming.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really love this trilogy.  The characters grow and change and it's identifiable for many people. I know there are those who don't like it but I'm not that guy. :)  I read the entire trilogy three times.  I enjoyed every moment.  I also downloaded the music she references and I LOVE it!!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I hooked this thing up today and have taken it for a test spin. Setup was quick and easy. Getting my browser to work with it took a little more fiddling, but that's just because I didn't want my work email associated with my youtube etc... nevermind. Anyway, Chromecast works basically as promised. It's sort of neat that I can pull up a youtube video on my phone or tablet or computer and get it playing on my big screen.<br /><br />It was apparent right away though that the image was cropped on my screen. I'm running a 1080p stream to a 1080p screen, and don't have this issue with my PS3, Xbox, Blu Ray player, or Boxee or Roku. I streamed my screen as well, and sure enough it wasn't a true representation of my laptop screen. Didn't matter what I streamed from either - I tried doing so from my phone, and the youtube video was cropped on all sides - looked zoomed in. I played around with my tv settings, and it didn't fix the issue. There's no settings to be found for fixing it either.<br /><br />Even zoomed in, it was a nice quick way to send youtube to my tv (even though I have other methods) - it's easily the fastest way considering the time it takes to fire up other devices. Hulu was also zoomed in, and the performance was choppy. I noticed I had to have the video playing in my laptop at the same time and I couldn't close the lid on my laptop. If I went full screen, Hulu would show full screen on my tv, but I couldn't do anything else with my laptop. The video on my laptop was not synced with the video on the screen. So if I want to watch hulu and do other stuff with my laptop, I have to watch it in the browser window which you can see on the tv screen rather than full screen. Full screen crops the video anyway though like I said, so there's really no good way to watch hulu I don't think. Unless I'm missing something.<br /><br />Netflix had the same issue as Hulu with the cropping and full screen. Youtube didn't have the full screen issue where I couldn't do anythingelse with my laptop... just the cropping.<br /><br />This is a decent little device for the price, but I probably won't use it for much besides youtube streaming. I'd say for what it costs, if you plan to only use it to stream Youtube, it's worth the money. Otherwise, save your hdmi port for something better. If I had a time machine, I would probably not buy it again since I don't really need it. In fact, I may relegate it to the bedroom tv that never really gets used. I'm going to hang on to it though to see if they release updates for it that make it better. So far, a pretty &#34;meh&#34; experience.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really love this trilogy.  The characters grow and change and it's identifiable for many people.

0385350864|5.0|Helen Fielding never fails to amuse me with her heroine Bridget Jones and her antics. I guess I identify with her at the different stages of her life, and all of the joy, pain, longing, awkwardness and grace, that afflict so many of us. In a way she is the archetypal anti-heroine, who reminds us of our friends and ourselves, struggling with the vagaries of life.
B008JFUPFI|1.0|1. Poor casting and acting. Lois is better suited to a daytime soaps role. Kal (Superman) acted like he was in an urban gang dance off. Zod acted like an American upset in a traffic tie-up. Jor drew upon Greek/Roman myth movie for a god like countenance. All misplaced and stereotypic. Fishburne must have been the ethnic diversity quota because he just didn't have credibility as a news dept. head.<br />2. Cheap, unimaginative graphics borrowed (stolen) from lots of older fantasy movies especially those with floating cities and other floaties. The space craft looked more appropriate for cartoon fantasy with zero basis in reality.<br />3. Old storyline of bad guys chase good guy; a couple battles ensue; good guy ekes it out in the end. Ho hum.<br />4. Dialogue that only cloistered Hollywood writers could unimaginatively come up with. &#34;As a result our natural resources became unstable. We exhausted, our planets core.&#34; Huh! That makes no scientifically, even middle school level, sense. There is no connection between the two. Or this tripe &#34;Eventually our military leader, General Zod, attempted a coup.&#34; He must have been inspired by events in Central/South America or Africa or Far East. Finally &#34;I have journeyed across an ocean of stars to reach you.&#34; That is a terribly misplaced metaphor for our Universe.
B0049M7BDE|5.0|an absolute classic. a remake of an old movie that i never saw. all i know is this one is extremely classy and well done. both main actors play their part well and make the movie run along at a fast and fun pace. it has a light and upbeat feel to it and is worth watching more than once just for the sake of enjoying the ride.<br /><br />highly recommend
B009KKLQVS|5.0|This may be the last time the Beach Boys will tour together. This show is excellent. They have an absolute music machine, their vocals just soar and they don't miss a note instrumentally. If you want one Beach Boys DVD, then this is it.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like candy crush saga but I don't like that it blocks you from playing tor such a long time and then you either have to wait ir ask fir lives. so that part I don't like.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|We loved it!  It's the first time my 6 year old watched it.  He sang along, cheered and enjoyed it immensely.  Just be prepared - the movie runs almost 2 1/2 hours - start it early!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved the imagery from this book.  The author has a style that is so unique with the narrator being Death overseeing the events surrounding Liesel, her foster family and the neighbors on Himmel Street.  Like others have written...it is not a fast read book (and I am not saying it dogs along either!) but you get totally drawn into these characters and their reaction to the war in Germany.  I am eager to see how this book is portrayed in the movies
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|this game is so good you can do almost anything! if you like fighting, buy it. if you like building, buy it. if you like minecraft,  this is waaaaaay better. get it now.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy, simple, just right.<br />large buttons. easy on the eyes. convenient for quick and simple fast calculation. prefer it over small size on phone.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is highly addicting.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes physics based games.  Om Nom is an awesome character.
B005PK553C|2.0|Predictable ending.  Really talented actors who could easily have stretched to their limits first.  Not a working or cohesive story line, either.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|How can such a simple game be so damn addictive?!  I'm super excited that they finally put Candy Crush on Kindle! I just wish you were given more lives at a time, or the time to regain more weren't so long. Don't try to play if you only have a few minutes! Time seems to fly when playing!
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|Love it!! It feels like part of the phone, it makes my phone look really good! Great product, I highly recommend it!!
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|It is a great game me and my sister play it a lot.<br />Its my# 1 game I like my kindle fire HDX it is fun<br />I am lucky I have a kindle fire HDX.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly:  We love he balance of cowboys and the future.  A must watch.  Funny, thrilling, moving, exciting. Everything you need for a good show.
B007PP2J9I|4.0|The writing in this book is better than his first. There is more violence though.<br /><br />Scenes and locations are described in detail that matches that of the detail of the cyber warfare descriptions. This might make for an enjoyable read for a non-techie as well.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|It did have moments that seemed to lull on, but how important those moments were is only made known later on.  A feeling of finality covered me as I finished the book, but also thirsting for more.  I don't know if Brandon can read my mind but he so perfectly led me down the path I though I had created only to find that the answer had been given to me a number of times through the book.  Story, top notch.  Characters, they need a bit of development, but you do come to care for most of them.  If you like Brandon Sanderson you will enjoy this book.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|I am a big fan of the movie Red! I went to the movies to see Red 2, and fell in love with all the action and the charactors that was in the previous movie! Money well spent!
0307352153|5.0|This is the kind of book that could be life-altering or merely pleasant affirmation, depending on how much you know before reading it.  I almost gave the book a 4, since it has rather a lot of personal anecdotes and does not provide any information not available in more scholarly works.  However, its purpose seems to be to get &#34;the ordinary person&#34; to see introversion as a personality type rather than a personality problem. It achieves that purpose admirably (assuming an introvert reader).  I was particularly happy that it avoided the common problem in books with similar titles of a focus on how introverts are really okay--if they can stop being introverts.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love it! Something everyone needs! Everyones the Bible why not get the bible that has plans;challges; reads the Bible to you. Or you can just read it by your self.It also finds chapters ; verses; and books in the bible.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's is the best puzzle game of the year so far said by myself because it's not that easy and it's not that hard
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was one of the most beautiful most amazing things I have ever read. I will never forget this book and how much it means to me.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Amazing book - MUCH better than the movie!  The inner life of Ender is thoroughly engrossing and quite detailed.<br /><br />The only problem is that you will want to read the next one, which is also a really good read.
B00EHIELXS|5.0|I am prepping for my first TED Talk. There are hundreds of articles on how to do it, but no resource comes close to the clarity of Jeremey's book. It is so specific and so simple, that he sets up any speaker for success. He covered every aspect of TED speaking. He clearly understands the difference between TED talking and regular public speaking, and stays focused on TED's mission to create &#34;an idea worth spreading.&#34; Anyone who will be taking the TED stage should read this book, if they want to deliver a talk that makes a difference. Thank you Jeremey for writing it!!
B005UD1D62|4.0|Lauren Conrad can do no wrong in my opinion. Anything she does turns to platinum! The Fame Game is a continuation of the antics from her best selling book series &#34;L.A. Candy&#34;. I loved &#34;L.A.Candy&#34; and I absolutely loved &#34;The Fame Game&#34;. Sometimes I got the feeling that Lauren wrote these series of books from her personal reality t.v. experiences and just changed some names and circumstances around and because of that reason, I became even more hooked. I give this series an A+ because she made the most notoriously hated character in the series into a real person with actual feelings.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The reason that I like this book is because Reza Aslan relies on factual data of the times as described in secular history. He describes the life of Christ in these terms. He makes a good case for depicting Christ as the son of man rather than the son of God. He discounts the virgin birth and his visit to the Temple at the age of twelve to discuss religious matters with the priests and scribes. What he emphasizes is that Christ was a simple Galilean, a carpenter who none the less attracted a large following and inspired the formation of a new religion. While most messiahs of the time have long been forgotten Christ was not. Aslan states that something miraculous occurred that made Christ's message and life resonate through the ages. I believe that the miraculous event was Christ's resurrection, something the Aslan doesn't state but implies.
B00AKKGX4W|3.0|I have liked Courtney Milan in the past. I have read a number of her short stories in anthologies and novellas. I think she gives a depth to her characters that many authors in her genre do not, and I appreciate that. However, in this novel (my first full-length reading of Milan), the characters have TOO much depth. There is simply too much going on. Robert wants to redeem himself and prove that he is not his father. However, his subversive activities are rather difficult to understand. He could straight-forwardly move toward fixing many of the problems that his father caused. However, he wants not only to repair his father's misdeeds but also to change an entire way of life. Minnie's background is absurd. In attempting to create a heroine that has a terrible secret and who could never be a Duchess, Milan has created a caricature. Robert is more believable, and he is terribly sweet in that he has been too busy redeeming his dukedom that he has never before had a romance.<br />There was too much vulgarity for my taste--mentions of body parts and activities were simply unnecessary and did not flesh out the characters in any fashion that furthered the storyline.<br />I really haven't decided if I want to read any other of the novellas/novels in this series.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|DA bomb...can download my videos and watch whenever...usually sometime when I don't have internet... Like on roadtrips and such... Download when you have and watch when you don't.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is the best game in the whole wide world I love it. My cousin always asks me to play it.  and. my brother loves it
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I've bought several of these for Bug Out Bags to keep things sharp. This is a great tool because it is small and works so well. Be sure you tie on a piece of paracord and secure it because a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one. The rod is great on serrated blades and fish hooks.
8866135909|5.0|Excellent quality , this has save the day, this is used a my day to day planner for work . strong backing
B0089LOKHG|3.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!<br /><br />Great writing and story-telling. Like the other books in the trilogy, I couldn't put it down. Like the other books in the trilogy, I hated the ending. However, with Delirium and Pandemonium I had the next book to look forward to, hoping that resolution would come. Now it's truly over, and I don't like the ending one bit... I was completely on board until one paragraph:<br /><br />\\"For a second I feel a sense of overwhelming grief: for how things change, for the fact that we can never go back. I'm not certain of anything anymore. I don't know what will happen -- to me, to Alex and to Julian, to any of us.\\"<br /><br />If not for the ending, I would rate it 5 stars.
0812550706|1.0|Most likely the worst book I've ever read, stupid ending, book doesn't start till like the last 4 chapters. its awful. if you want to waste your time go ahead but don't buy.
B00FN3HRFA|5.0|Wonder songs, impeccable voice.  Barbra is always perfect in performance and this is no exception. A great album. Must have.
B000YDE46Y|3.0|Great boots, but always order them 1/2 size down.  They were far too big. I gave them to my brother who loves them. Again, great boots, but they run very large.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works flawlessly, loads quick, lets phone calls and messages through.  Doesn't do such a good job of guiding the reindeer.
B000P46QTA|5.0|I thought  would be distracting reading the subtitles but I got so engrossed in the film I didn't even notice it. For once, an Academy award winner that agree with. Loved, loved this film.
B00GJ2MT1Q|5.0|OMG I LOVE FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS ALBUM ROCKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LISTEN TO IT ALL THE TIME!!!!!!!!FGL ROCKS!!! I CANT WAIT FOR MORE
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Very unusual story.  I loved the characters in this book.  The magic and illusions in this story made it very intersting.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|** spoiler alert ** I am so disappointed in how the author chose to end this series. I'm not against sad endings or even killing off the main character if it makes sense (for example My Sister's Keeper) but in this case it did not make sense. Besides that, what is up with all of the characters staying in Chicago at the end? They just found out there is a big huge world outside of the fence, and yet they choose to stay put inside the fence - WEAK. I agree with those who said that this sort of ruins the entire series and makes me less enthusiastic for the Divergent movie, because why bother when it's going to end like this???
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Good game but it's a lil hard to earn money quickly. And crowns are hard to get. But not bad overall.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I ordered this to go with my new Kindle, which was recommended as the charger cord, that I received as a gift.
B004GYY714|5.0|It is an excellent program! So far, as far as I know, there is no better radio app than this one. Of note, even Mercedes-Benz using it in its on-board internet radio (but they want you to pay for it).
B001FB55I0|2.0|I was fired up to see this film when it first came out in theaters. It takes a serious amount of motivation to get me to the theatre as opposed to watching a film at home on my quality system. It's hard to fully convey how hugely disappointed I was while sitting through it.<br /><br />The explosions were the only thing keeping me alert along with a couple Terminator-ish scenes involving the humanoid machines. Bale as John Conner did nothing for me and although I realized that he had to be sullen in an apocalyptic world , I just got tired of his empty look and monotoned voice. The overall acting was stiff . Many tight camera scenes had the look of a TV movie.  I could just see the cameras rolling in my head.<br /><br />Using all the Terminator phrases and Skynet language just isn't enough without real tension from characters you like, or even want to hate. I cared more in Termanator 3, which was my least favorite of the first three, about what happened to the pets in the pet shop than anything going on in \\"Salvation\\".<br /><br />I think they should have used the actor that played John Conner as an adult in clips from T2. I was more entertained from those \\"in the future\\" scenes than from this whole film. The film makers just couldn't carry this franchise into a fitting last installment. Try as they did to make connections to the past, the film just didnt capture the future ( that should make sense). The half man half machine character was visually cool and added the second star to my review. Im writing this after a blu ray reviewing in which I hoped that my theatre experience may have been a bad dream. Unfortunately I was as awake as I thought.
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|A great movie from a great book by a great author.  So many movies now are like Campbell's soup.  While ostensibly containing different ingredients they all end up basically the same - formulaic. This movie, while made in Hollywood of course, is buoyed up the mastery of the author behind the book and supported by the psychology of the main character - which is actually his drive to convince himself he is worthy which hinges on winning a particular woman.  Therefore it is a cut above.  It's also beautifully filmed.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The app is super easy to use and very reliable. I'm always late but it doesn't have anything to do with this app!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game feels like im playing Call Of Duty on my kindle. The guns look amazing and just feels like im on my console.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|I just find this movie super cute and entertaining.  Always a pleasure to watch.  Great cast of characters.  Definitely a movie I can watch over and over again!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|If you enjoy Si-Fi, you'll love this series!  Always a great twist to the plot and or connected to a previous episode.  I believe to be well written and acted.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|Unfortunately the advertisement for this movie, to me, drew you in but the movie puts you off.  Arguably I haven't read the Great Gatsby but the movie just seemed to drag on.  I watched this post Thanksgiving day dinner and if the food wasn't enough to put you to sleep, this movie definitely would do it.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|It's a classic! Part historical, part musical, part comedy...it fulfills all emotions.  My freshmen loved the movie.  It's not a movie that they would pick themselves, but it needs to be part of their repertoire.
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|I didn't know what to expect with this movie, however based on its description I thought it would have been more action packed.  If you want to get depressed and instill a new fear of flying, I would recommend it.  Otherwise you may want to find something a little more lighthearted.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was once of his best.  Neither my husband or I could put it down.  The characters each have some flaws, so it feels more real.  The story does still leave some questions as the end as to why the main character made some of the decisions in the manner that he did, but that adds to the book in a way, as you keep thinking about it.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Terraria is a game which I simply cannot put down. Unlike most other games, you can truly do whatever you want. If I had to choose between Minecraft and Terraria, I would choose Terraria because It is so much more complex, fun,  and entertaining!
B00EKJWS1Q|2.0|An Outlook app that is full of ad ware? That is just ridiculous. The app also seems to limit you to the length of your emails. I'd much prefer an adware free app that costs a small price than a limited use free app that constantly tries to sell me something that I couldn't care less about. I think I'll just write my own apk to access Outlook from my Kindle.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This gme is fun and has an interesting method of moving the story forward.  The story line is interesting and the scenes are detailed.  Some objects may be harder to find, but there are hints if you get stuck.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I thought that Keira Cass did a wonderful job on this novel. I almost cried when America was leaving and there were a lot of unexpected twists in the plot. I absolutely am dying to read \\"the one.\\"<3<3<3
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Later regions, especially 6 routinely position all animals close to exits, giving you not enough time to shoot them all. That is not enough time without a weapon purchased with real money, or a consumable. I considered donating a bit of money before this, as I enjoyed it before this. There is no chance of me doing that now. Another overly priced, overly greedy freemium game.
B000FC1192|4.0|Me and my best friends favorite movie is Coraline.  So, when realized their  was a book we absolutely had to read it together. On that note we started out with high expectations and we were not disappointed. This book sucked you in right from the start and all the way till the end. It was actually pretty scary  and gave  me chills at times. I loved this book and I hope you do to.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I downloaded this to my Kindle Fire. After all, how does one survive with being able to &#34;google it?&#34; It's easy to desginate the kind of file you want to obtain like Web or Images plus many other types.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Handy App for my Android Tablet, has all the functions + four advanced functions, and the convenience of a handy calculator.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|Well-written but relatively boring conflict-free book is excellent for people with heart conditions or those who are allergic to dramatic tension.<br /><br />Very little character development. Add +1 star if you live in San Francisco, since the book is set there.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It has amazing graphics with animals that look as if they are in the real world with a new hunt for every holiday that comes.Every Hunter's dream with duck hunts and elk who knows how far it goes know, to see what it's like just get the game and I bet you never forget what you see in this game and will be left wondering what is next to come.
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|This is a film for drug and alcohol problem people. The entire film is drinking, drinking, drugs, drinking. Boring. Because Denzel Washington is in it, it got two stars. That' the only reason it wasn't one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found  it to have a very slow start for my taste, however when I hit about 42% it took off like a rocket. Made the wait well worth it, I couldn't put it down! Can't wait to start the second one right now!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game you can get a lot of cash in short periods of time so u don't have to buy the cash with real money
B007N8RULO|5.0|Great way to waste time. Easy to get started and fun. Can't beat the price. I would definetly recommend this app for any tablet owner.
B00D48BSBA|4.0|Super Smooth book. Definitely one of his un-put-down-ables. We jump straight into the story and the pages turn by themselves.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Have to agree with others about graphics of this game and also am becoming a fan of this developer. Playing a few of their games and enjoy all of them.
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|This is probably my favorite installment in the Jesse Stone movies, starring Tom Selleck.  It was the first movie produced, but Jesse Stone:Night Passage is the pre-quel, so it is best to watch Night Passage first.  The story is well written, is about characters that the<br />viewer will care about, and the characters are well cast.  I recommend all 8 Jesse Stone movies, and Stone Cold in particular.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Nothing wrong with this app, so it may actully deserve a higher rating. My hesitation to give any more stars actually stems from the design of the kindle tablet itself. Having the camera lense on the same side of the tablet as the viewing screen is just awkward. Great for selfies, pretty much worthless for anything else.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|While at times I had to suspend belief, this book kept me engaged and entertained. Well worth spending some hours curled up with the wonderful heroine and her world.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Exciting, adventure. Good guys, bad guys....good overtakes bad. Actors and characters are perfect for each and every person. We never know what's going to happen next.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|A harsh reality of what we are dealing with in the region of terrorism.....and anyone who thinks there is a continuous ongoing win here is delusional....just watch this movie.  One can not attest to the accuracy of everything in the movie thus some areas/items may be different but it was still well done both in the complexity of monitoring and capturing intelligence as well as following thru with a plan when there are extensive geo-political issues present. The current use of drones avoids much of the ground intell required as demonstrated in this movie but then you have no real intell for the future. A well done movie but seems not to answer all questions.....I wonder where this very motivated CIA female is now and what has she locked onto to get to the bottom of any new project.....seems she is not very politically correct (PD'd) which is needed for her position.
B009T1J0WA|5.0|This book is as awesome as every other diary of the wimpy kid series. This book is awesomer then awesomest. Go Jeff Kinney
B00EVW04PE|2.0|poor picture quality for HD. Not sure whether the streaming was bad or not. Was actually worse than standaard TV. Right now it seems like a waste of money and time
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is the best hunting game I have ever played. It has great graphics and it is easy to play plus it is free.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Best of the Quell so far. The music is lovely, and so relaxing that I get lost in the game. My interest is kept high by the cool challenges that work your brain, but without the stress of being timed.  I usually get free games, but I consider this money well spent.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy playing this game it is exacting trying to get from level to the next. I play about 20 times within 24 hrs.
B0064MGU98|3.0|well acted, well written.  Like most other legal dramas, the types of cases the star handles are totally unrealistic.  Nearly every case is sensational, the type most lawyers never see.  Also, the ease with which she and her investigator solve murders and other assorted crimes is total fantasy.  I liked the parts dealing with her family situation and her husbands predicament.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|a touching, beautiful and classic movie, although the plot is a little different from the book. The movie is free and can be played smoothly on online.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|&#34;This game is the best. I have bought all the extras and eagerly await more. I really cant wait to get it on my phone
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Lately all the kids at my son's elementary school have been talking about the &#34;new&#34; Dr. Who shows. So thanks to Amazon Prime, we started watching, and everyone in the family has become hooked. Interesting characters and imaginative plots.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|A fun movie, just scary enough (for a 4-year-old) to make for a good time. I'll be buying it to add to our digital library.
B003PJ6UHA|4.0|I loved this book.<br />It was a combination of science, logical argument and personal journey. It did a great job of tying the different areas of quantum theory, biology and physics together. I am actually quite convinced that the author has some very valid points.<br />But I wasn't convinced by the book, however. It makes some good arguments but in the end, they were not fully convincing.<br />They felt &#34;preachy&#34; to me.<br />I highly recommend this book for many reasons. It provides a big-picture view of the quest for the theory-of-everything
B001P06GX4|5.0|I love this game! You can play with 2 or 4 players. (You can with 3, but it's a little weird). It's a spatial strategy game and my boyfriend and I play with just the two of us often. I'm a big tetris nerd, so if you are one or know one, you should probably get Blokus!
B000FBFM9S|3.0|I would really rate this as 2.5 out of 5. This is a good book. Not great. It is well-written, the characters are distinct, each with his or her own voice. The plot wanders a bit, but it does end up where I think it's supposed to go. However, I could never really get a grip on it. Was it about the multiculturalism of Great Britain, was it about the relationships between parents and children, was it about faith and friendship, the experience of the immigrant, fundamentalism, or just teeth? It could have been about all of them or even one of them or even something else entirely. The one theme that stood out for me was that of rebellion, but I don't think that's what the author was getting at.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I have been waiting to play this game for forever! I saw people on YouTube and was amazed by the quality. I personally like it a little bit more than minecraft because the price is lower and you get much, much more. I would like to have some sort of creative mode but I also love survival so it's all good, but as a suggestion to the creators(505 games) make a creative mode. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!
B00GII9UCW|5.0|I must say, I love anything that Norah Jones is involved with.  She is great.  She and Billie Joe are wonderful together and their close harmonies blend beautifully.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Lots of information in the beginning but it all comes together in the end. This story makes you think what we all have thought before, what if...
B008FPOIT6|3.0|It's an easy book with some really nice imagery. Although you may need to be a sci-fi/fantasy person to suspend your disbelief sufficiently to just go with it. But if you can, it's a really fun little romp.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome very fun better than temple run and amazing to play I recommend for everyone wanting to sit down and have fun
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was very well written but I wish there was more information on all of the districts rebellions this book overall however was pretty good.
0385340575|4.0|This is the second Reacher novel for me and I enjoyed it very much. The beginning was my favorite part in this one. I have enjoy Child's writing in this series, especially Reacher's thought processes. Like most novels, it has some slow point, but not many. Realism is also sacrificed for entertainment value, but it's an excellent trade off. If you like action and adventure, you should like this.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|Two good looking, talented actors, and a story about both love and patience.  Well worth the watching, a quiet love story that resonates.
B000ZHXUG4|3.0|Eastern Promises is shallow on plot and character background. It took a while for me to figure out if the movie was set in England or some city in Russia. The movie ends with little resolved. I was hoping it would be more like Viggo Mortensen's &#34;History of Violence&#34;.<br /><br />The one take away is the bloody knife/blade violence. Guns must be very difficult for even criminals to obtain in England, therefore the consistent depiction of horrific throat cutting violence. American gun violence depicted in movies as realistic as it is, is still easier to stomach than murder by the blade.
B003UBTX72|4.0|A full disclaimer is in order here: I've attempted to play Keith Richards style rhythm guitar in both performing classic rock bands and noisy garage ensemble since I was an awkward teen. I've played so many Stones tunes that I feel like I owe them royalties.<br /><br />That said, I approached this book with fear and trepidation. I love the music and didn't want it tainted by the truth about the man who helped create it.<br /><br />Not that I expected any member of the Rolling Stones to be an angel.<br /><br />Fortunately, I can keep playing with no remorse. Keith is as much of a rogue as I expected but he's self-aware, though not apologetic, about his rock and roll crimes and misdemeanors.<br /><br />The great news here is that he has a literary voice that provides nice harmony to his singing voice: a bit shrill, slightly raw, mixed with equal parts joy and pain.<br /><br />The book reads as if Keith spoke it directly into a microphone. The vernacular is often so rich that I fantasized creating a smartphone app to translate him into English (here's the article I wrote about this: http://www.sagenews.ca/Article.asp?id=3247 )<br /><br />My favorite part of the book was his discussion of the band's very early days living in a cheap flat with barely enough coins to feed the heater. The early Stones wore out the grooves in blues records to learn their craft and had clearly paid some dues by the time they became an &#34;overnight sensation.&#34;<br /><br />Another great segment is the story of the Stones early tour of the UK as an opening act for Little Richard.<br /><br />Interesting and painful was his frank discussion of the depths of his drug addictions. This starts with the crazy scene that opens the book and continues throughout. Knowing the back story shines a brighter light on the music, particularly &#34;Exile on Main Street.&#34;<br /><br />A real treasure for me is Keith's discussion of his unique style and 5-string, Open G approach to rhythm guitar. I tried this and discovered the secret to the tunes I'd been playing wrong all these years.<br /><br />For Stones fans, this is a must read. It would be of equal interest to anyone interested in the cultural history of the early 60's.is and discovered the secret to the tunes I'd been playing wrong all these years.<br /><br />For Stones fans, this is a must read.

B009LXEBD4|5.0|Of course, Kelly has a fantastic voice so all of the songs on this CD are enjoyable. If you want to own her biggest songs without having to buy a lot of CDs, this CD is for you. I really enjoy listening to all of the songs.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun and interesting game<br />Once I figured out all aspects of the game it was just challenging enough but not too difficult.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Best Alterbridge album to date!<br />If you love hard rock and metal and guitar solos this album is for you! I definitely recommend it!
B000FVQM2Y|1.0|Disappointing on so many levels - storyline, acting, plot, development... Reruns of the Flintstones would offer more substance at every level.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Truly one of my favorites! I don't know why American TV cannot make shows as endearing and witty. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a life worth living.
0689878451|5.0|Once social debate abates... this book will be regarded a classic. Endearing, engaging, enlightening, an absolute joy to read. This book holds a special and perpetual place on my coffee table.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|I wholeheartedly enjoyed the &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; book series, and so far the television series is closely following the books.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|These headphones are GREAT for quality and accuracy. They do however NEED to be connected to a device that's giving them power. Otherwise you can't truly experience their potential. And keep in mind- they're open ear headphones. Other people around you will definitely be able to head what you're listening to haha
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Absolutely fun times!! Super addictive, but super fun too!! I'm on it constantly and can't get enough of it. Wake till sleep I can't get away from it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Typical Stephen King...What's not to love? I love all of his books...The Shining, It, TommyKnockers, Insomnia, etc.  Please continue to write more...
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a book club selection. Good story and lots to discuss! I highly recommend it. It gives a wonderful intertwining of the lives of the women and the paths their choices take them on.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Good story very predicable.  Glad I did not watching this movie in the theater.  First time I've seen Denzel play a bad guy.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was a masterpiece.  I am a teacher and I am even reading this book as a read aloud for my 4th and 5th graders.  I connected to the main character August because I was bullied myself (not as much as him by far). Please take the time to read this book!  It awakens the sense of meanness that humankind can exhibit while also showing the real beauty is on the inside not the outside.
B003Y3ZTGA|1.0|This is a horrible album..it contains one of the worst songs ever created if not THE worst song ever created...it is a filthy disgusting sex song that has no degree of intelligence...for that reason I cannot fathom giving the album any more than 1 star and even that is 1 star too many.
B00EVW04PE|3.0|watched olympus falling first this movie put me to sleep.I will watch again (when free) to rate properly. (two more required words)
B00C2FFJFM|1.0|This is utter trash to be honest...Every song sounds completely unfinished and the vocals and lyrics are simply awful. Plus the lyrics are not clean or appropriate for kids...kids would be the only ones who could probably stand listening to this but they should not even ilsten to it because it's not good for them because it has suggestive content.
1439152810|4.0|It took a little bit of time before the book arrived. I felt that I ordered the book in plenty of time to be able to read it before book club.  By the time the book  arrived, I only had a few days to finish it.  Needless I did not complete this book but I did participate in the book club discussions.  In the end everything worked out OK.  And I was not the only one in the book club who did not finish the book so I didn't feel too bad.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is the most fun I've had on a kindle game!!! Great graphics, easy to use, all around fun. I love hunting game and this one delivers.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham knows how to writ a compelling novel.  His work is always holding my attention.  The good guys always seem to win so a bit predictable just not always sure how that will occur.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|For my daughter.... who can resist Twilight?!  It was exactly as we expected it to be. A great movie enjoyed by all.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Love Johns work well written and keeps you fascinated. Love stories of the south to be reminded of terrible injustice
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Writing is superb.  Was a little upset when ...  No I won't say but now I am left in limbo waiting the new season.  Can't wait.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Love the game. But dislike that things cost crowns and you have to purchase crowns. I do not have the money to spend on a game to level up.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|After seeing season 1, my wife and I could not stop watching.  We both know we are going to catch up before the new season (season 4) and will regret watching this so much, but we can't help ourselves.
B00A83075M|5.0|This is one of mine and my childrens favorite movies. Worth the money.So so funny. I would recommend this buy
B008Y5T5ZE|3.0|I watch this every once in awhile when the mood strikes me...but it has that corny 90s movie feel to it, and due to the content (devil worship) most people will not be able to get past that to actually listen to the story. All in all i would say its an ok movie.
0984999302|5.0|Excellent book.  It's thoughtfully conceived and well put together from experienced entrepreneurs, but reads like a textbook, as I suppose a reference manual should.  I don't think this book is for everyone, since it is a comprehensive offering, and perhaps best suited for people who haven't started up a company with big start-up plans.  I can see where a more concise book, might generally be more worthwhile, but every entrepreneur has different challenges.  Still, at 577 pages, it's a long read; but a worthwhile one for the motivated entrepreneur, and I know I'm going to read it from cover to cover.  Reading a book like this might just pay off in helping you launch your next big idea, and even if it doesn't, you'll respect those who do start-up a company much more.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this show! It is an intelligent and well written seres that has me on the edge of my seat to know what happens next in everyones lives, from the cook to the lady of the house!
0307887898|5.0|Well written.  Insightful ideas for entrepreneurs to ponder.  When you're starting a new business, you're trying to make money from something that didn't exist before, so doesn't it make sense to read a book on examples of up-coming challenges you may face first to be better prepared?
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Let me start out by saying that i am NOT a star trek fan. I am star wars all the way. So maybe that will put into prospective the compliment i give this movie when i tell you that i have seen them both multiple times and love them! I feel like star trek has finally got on board with making the movies a little more action instead of a group of people just trying to butt into aliens lives while telling everyone they have a non-interference policy! It is a credit to their genera and it is a world gone mad when ever star trek movie is better than the last and every star wars movie is worse :/ just the review of a frustrated geek!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Started off very slow but had a nice twist in the middle. It gets better after page 150. Psychological minds and murder mystery.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|As always DA IS A FANTASTIC SHOW. Although this season had some horrifying scenes and shocking deaths i love the show FOR THAT REASON! If you are writing a real life like story, people do things they shouldn't and people die! I love everything about this show and cant wait to see where they take it next!
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Good movie for adults and young teens alike. I watched it with my son and we enjoyed discussing the movie as it unfolded and the decisions the main characters were making (good and bad.)
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I feel like this movie was really long and drawn out (like most are these days) and was pretty predictable.  It really got interesting in the, last 30 mins or so. Overall it wasnt bad but i wont be watching it again any time soon. However, my husband loved it...so make of that what you will.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I am a big fan of this dvd. I have been using it for 6+ months. The instruction is great. I saw results very fast. I like the different levels. Because the workout is so short you can't &#34;phone-it-in&#34;. The way that the strength, cardio and abs are broken up is nice because your muscles get (a very short amount of) rest in between. The warm-up is great. During the cool down I generally do additional stretching because it goes a little fast. The last level is very challenging, don't get discouraged the first few times you do it. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is level 3. Level 3 is a bit hard on the joints (especially knees). I do modifications so my knees aren't so sore. All in all this is a great DVD that is easy to follow, effective and  a real time saver.
B00F880BWG|4.0|ITS GETING KINDA BORING. I MEAN ITS THE SAME OLD THING EVERY WEEK .SORRY BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|By far one of the most creative things I've ever seen! It combines beauty and Art at the same time. Never before has a movie sent me through all these different emotions at the same time. I would suggest this to anyone who like Anime, Techno and or Romance. I wish I could give this movie a sixth star!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a very suspenseful book, and I just couldn't put it down for one second. This is a must read.
B000059MEK|5.0|If you like this Album do your self a favor and buy Interstella 5555: The Story of the Secret Solar System. It will make you appreciate Daft Punk on another level.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|this is a big watch<br />love that the knobs don't dig into my hand<br />it gets a lot of comments
B004RUF9DC|4.0|As far as the message is concerned I give it a 5 stars rating. But as far as Blu-ray quality is concerned I give it a 0 star rating. it is simply awful on Blu-ray video quality. I bet the DVD version looks better than this Blu-ray version as far as picture quality is concerned. I recommend the DVD version. No need to pay a premium for the Blu-ray version if the video quality is lacking.
B000RLFJQ2|4.0|Robert De Niro is an awesome actor and does a great job in this movie! It's much more realistic than many of the action movies that have been made to date.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|This is a great game and I love spider- man ,however  the fact that this started  freezing wasn't good and then It starts freezing my Kindle Fire HD,which isn't good,I am thinking of deleting it.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Wow. Such a bad film. It makes every single superman film before hand, included the failed Superman Returns look like a masterpiece.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great matching game! Fun 2 play &amp; like that u only get so many lives at a<br /> time so u r not sucked n 4 2 long!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It make me think about the choices we make and how we deal with the truth to suit our selves.
B00F33E3C0|5.0|I'm at level three in Rosetta Stone, and I understood 75-80 percent of these stories. Not enough to get frustrated but with some words to learn.  It's helpful that the stories are contemporary, and have colloquialisms, so you get a better sense of how contemporaries speak the language.  This made it a good adjunct to a generic language learning program.<br /><br />I hope Andre continues writing books for German language learners. It really helps to have something to read that bridges the gap between language textbooks and programs and books written for native German speakers.
B000SJJCX4|3.0|I bought this to use with my bass guitar for live performances. So far, it works ok. It obviously has problems with low tunings. As long as I'm playing in E standard, with a little work it gets the job done. In my chain I place the tuner after my limiter/enhancer to help it pick up the sound better. When I try to tune my E to drop D however, it has issues &#34;not hearing&#34; the low note. This probably works really well on electric guitars, but it doesn't work as well on bass like advertised. It is a lot cheaper than a Boss brand tuner, which is a plus. If you are a guitar player and want to save yourself a lot of money, go for this tuner. If you're a bass player, maybe you'll have a better experience than me. I'm going to still work with it and see if there's something I'm missing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun. Easy to pick up and play at a moments notice. It also provides a real challenge. Super!
B0091W7MP4|4.0|Good cast and script. Tries to keep the suspense up but, falls short when actions frequently able to anticipate in advance. I think that takes some of the drama away. Overall good and I recommend as entertaining.
1844137864|5.0|A wonderful intro to Banksy's work, can't say enough great things about the artist and his work! Hopefully a book about his NYC visit will follow shortly.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|If you really watch this show, and watch the main character, there are valuable lessons to be learned; not all of them good, but lessons nonetheless. The acting was beyond reproach... of course.
0385537131|5.0|Absolutely love reading this John Grisham's book because he ties interesting stories, twisting plots,  and believable characters into a Mississippi setting.
B001G50QCK|5.0|Have always wanted to see him grow into Superman... and it was finally done. Just wish he'd learned to fly a little sooner in the series.
B00G6ZTM3Y|3.0|I cant move things from my inventory to the hotbar. It is really annoying. This is the only reason I'm rating this a three star.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|I'm always like Batman, but the latest movies really do the character some serious credit. Enjoyed the early movies, and their play on old comic scripts, but can't get enough of the more realistic action and characters in this one.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Apparently, I have to review this before I reread it in order to better compare it to the movie...okay. Fine.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Follows in the steps of the Dark Knight, and every bit as good. Glad to see a serious Batman movie
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I have always waited for injustice gods among us to come out on kindle fire HD and its finally here!!!!!!
B008JFUPFI|5.0|As far as I'm concerned... the only REALLY good Superman movie ever made. This show explains who he is, where he came from, and why he's the way he is. It's realistic in how a boy of his abilities might cope with childhood, and explains how the final product came to be. It's much more realistic and believable than all the previous Superman flicks. I hope it's the start of a TRUE Superman legend!
B007SSDS24|4.0|This flick was surprisingly good. I didn't expect as much as I got and was really glad I took the time to watch it.
B0067RQYNW|1.0|it started malfunctioning as soon as I downloaded it. couldn't even tell you how the app runs because it kept not responding.
B00F91H666|5.0|WOW!!! What can I say?! This movie was absolutely fantastic. I understood the plot and the variations as the show progressed, and could see the ending as legitimate. Great Job!
159463176X|2.0|Having read and enjoyed the author's first two books, I expected to like this one too.  However I found this one annoying and frustrating to read in that it jumped around among various points of view and time periods and spend a lot of time developing characters who weren't essential to the story.  It was more like a collection of related short stories than a novel
B00EY7LT9Q|3.0|Pretty good, and getting better, but I'll save higher review to see what's ahead. I actually wish they would occasionally have a super being as a guest.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It is a well made story. Maxwell is just like me! If you buy this app, you will definitely not regret it at all! Great game!☺
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Outstanding job. Would recommend the app to all. Cuts out the clutter nicely and seemed to help speed up my Kindle Fire HD.
B008I34YYY|5.0|This movie was totally awesome. Yes it had some loop holes in the story line, but how it portrays the political climate is priceless. It doesn't even seem too far fetched, especially at this point in time.
B00AH8U3UC|5.0|I have always loved this show. I think this is my favorite season. Love the tension with karen won't give away. The writing for hank Moody's character is always so well done. Good job writers-
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|The game is really fun and exciting, but it takes too long to load. literally I wait there for 10 minutes. I also don't like how you can't play with-out energy. I guess that's realistic, but I think besides those things it's really good.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Does all you need on a tablet, works perfectly.  If I were to suggest anything it would be a more intuitive resize function.  Great otg app.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|This is a clever game, it is challenging but it's not impossible.  Great tool to help keep our mind sharp!
B004I1AGTC|5.0|Great story & action, even for subtitles. I enjoyed this movie, very dramatic, but balanced well by the action. Donnie Yen is great in this film.
B005IURG36|3.0|Read this as a kid and with no expectations, and I can imagine it will be awesome.  As an adult coming in with really high expectations, I was a bit disappointed.
B003INBNXO|5.0|So good I bought both of them. If you watched this, then you'll want to watch the second one. Absolutely on point both in action and in drama.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|great cd of the band one republic...i listen to it while driving,at home etc.. .One Republic is the best!!! :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love all these games on 101 games. there's not a game like it and that means the creator is unique
B006GWO5NE|5.0|.<br />This works very well. My 10 year old was happy that it came so quickly . The last one was not as nice as this one.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I loved how he explained the legal steps of putting together a case.i love how he adds the local names of southern towns and counties, like pike county. The words just flow
B0090SI3ZW|1.0|Someone told me to get it for them and I ended up watching.<br />This movie proves unequivocally why Russell Crowe needs to retire from films. If you like D-rated movies or are a Russell Crowe fan and therefore don't care if it's lousy, it's for you. The action is fast and furious but don't get if you want any substance.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Well written glimpse into a closed society that makes the recent murky detention of a Korean War veteran more comprehensible.
B00BB67UNW|3.0|The premise of this film is good; shady mayor, policeman turned PI, with the ensuing mayhem and merriment, including a murder. It wasn't bad, and the plot developed well with several nice twists and turns. However, Catherine Zeta-Jones seemed a needless add-on. The film could've been complete without her. Mark Wahlberg has developed into a fine, solid actor and he holds the film together. If you had to keep the volume down lower, Russell Crowe was nearly impossible to understand or hear, because his speaking voice is so low.<br />If you want a solid cop vs shady mayor story, this is one to see. No awards for it, however.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Best Bond Movie Ever! that's all you need to know, the movie is superb...it really takes you into the physicked of Bond...James Bond
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing on my kindle.  This game is fun and addicting.  If there wasn't a limit on tries I would probably play all the time!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this simple & traditional game... Calms me down & distressed without frustration! I'm not interested in competing with the world or my friends!
B008XG1X18|5.0|So much fun, I'm addicted! This app is basically like an online magazine, focusing in on things that you love. It is so much fun.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Bought this because after upgrading an older computer to windows 7 I couldn't find a compatible driver for the ethernet adapter. Plugged this in and the problem was solved.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I've read Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Sun's and this book was equally as good. Didn't want to put it down.  He is an outstanding author.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|This is a fun point and click adventure type game. No hidden object puzzles and nice artwork. However I finished it under two hours, which is Ok  for a FAOTD but I'd prefer more from a paid app.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Please make the jw library app available for the kindle fire. I can get it on my  computer but I want it on my kindle since that is my go to device. I'd like to get a new firebut want the jw app. Thanks!!!
B00GTZN0X4|5.0|My 6 yr old loved it and was very excited to tell me about it. I will probably buy it for X-mass
B00104QSOM|5.0|I bought Fargo and this at the same time a couple of weeks ago, on-sale on Amazon. When they got here, I had planned to watch them back to back but I only had time for 1 so I picked Fargo. Partly instinctively (I mean who doesn't love Fargo) and partly cuz it was a gray blustery day outside and Fargo seemed to fit. I thought about it later and I was glad I waited on There Will Be Blood because it's in that category of movie that deserves a certain amount of respect and willingness to gleefully endure an epic because the payoff is so good. Dances With Wolves, Gone With The Wind, Cat On A Hot Tin Roof... You know movies that are best in 1 long sitting with no distractions and preferably alone. Movies like Fargo and Pulp Fiction can be watched in a group or just certain scenes with your pals, and that's great. I mean who doesn't have lines from both of those movies memorized and you say them to a friend... who also love the movie and laughs and says his \\"Honey Bunny\\" line back to ya. But, movies like this one, get in your head with their slow unwind and great storytelling and they move you through every human emotion without you even realizing they have done it. Acting plays a huge part in this movie cuz neither of the leads could have been played by anyone else. He makes you want to BE an Oil Man... or at least invest in his wells, and the Preacher, Hell, I wanna slap him too. This is prolly the 5th or 6th time for me watching and the first time since I have owned it. It's Thanksgiving night, all the family is gone, I am full and peaceful and content, a lil buzzed and alone with the surround sound turned way up and the lights off. This movie is perfect for tonight. A+
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This is a sad, courageous, confounding, agonizing, infuriating, uplifting, and bizarre tale -- all at the same time.  In the movies, Shin would become a hero.  In real life, he can't escape his tortured past and at times seems lost, not knowing what to look for.  There, but for the grace of God, go I.
B00C5XBAOA|5.0|This is by far, one of the BEST Disney Character's that has come along in a very long while!! I think I love Sofia as much if not more then my Nana girl does!!
B009TZBEKW|5.0|I listened to others but,...listening to this DJ on the plane to get me through the turbulence and my phobia.
B004LK5CEE|5.0|Almost Famous remains to this day my favorite Cameron Crowe movie.  Obviously it was personal to him since the story is autobiographical, at least in part.  The story is effortless, the characters are strong, and the music transports you to the decade of the early seventies.  Spot on casting also makes this one of my top ten movies all time.  It's that good.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I use this as an alternative to hooking up my PC to my TV via HDMI. It is nice to immediately have the option to use Netflix on my non-smart TV. Only issue is sometimes it is hard to get the phone to recognize the device is present. It doesn't work with many apps at the moment, but hopefully there will be updates in the future. Responses can be sluggish at times.
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|will not let me log in facebook so I cannot ask for engery cores or share my progress needs to be fix if I'm going to continue to play
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is just the best  the numbers are large so can see them and the unit is so big you can see it so if ha e trouble with your eyes this is the one for you
0872860175|5.0|A wonderful accompaniment to the movie 'Howl' featuing James Franco. This book would have otherwise cost a great deal more from a bookstore.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Really great book. I love it, of course it's a classic so there is nothing more I can say about it to prove what a great book it is.
B00EV0CXZ0|3.0|Two album covers were slightly damaged. Was bought to collect and not open but the damage is a disappointment and lowers the future value
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This one was the second book I ever read it and I have very nice memories of it so I can't say anything bad about it. But honestly what a great book!
B0091W0JPE|5.0|My favorite movie.more classic lines than any movie. they don't get any better than this.  be sure to rent it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun game. It sucks when I run out of lives but I can't wait to get back to it.
B0081336FO|5.0|Taut, suspenseful, witty. An excellent modern take on a beloved classic, it avoids the cliches and delivers every time.<br />One does wish however that there were more episodes in a season!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I think this book has a lot of action. I wish there was more books in the series and tris had not died.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Fairly easy to understand the concepts of play. Pulls you into the high action &amp; speed of the game. A definite yes.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP ! I think it's awesome I wish I had Zeus !! I &lt;3 this game people !! Oh yeah !! Thank you creator of this game i love it  keep up the hard work!!! :)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is such an amazing book! It teaches us all to always be a little kinder than necessary, no matter what the situation.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|i hate the fact that on the kindle you cant send voice messages, when it has a speaker! change that!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I really like this game. it's very entertaining and fun. You go and try to build your kingdom. Great game!!!
B00GRWKK2I|2.0|Cant login in facebook.<br />But with free version is ok.<br />Please correct this bug otherwise is not worth buy pro.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game is nice.  I like the set-up, but there are just too many ads.  The game would be much better if there weren't so many ads popping up.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|all these many people have been waiting for a book of this kind. its very motivating and inspiring especially for those introverts who have been struggling in the extrovert world.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have read this  book 3  Times now - each time it gets better.The story telling moves me to tears and I have to put it down an collect myself-  only to  pick it back up and read more.  It's a very deep nd profound book-on of my all time favorites
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down until I had completed it!  Great suspense and drama.  This is a must-read!  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|the movie is pretty good. I think it starts off a little slow and a little confusing. However, after about 20 minutes into it, it starts making sense. I think the acting is pretty good just not great at times. We watched it streaming from Amazon. The picture quality was good and the sound in Dolby Digital was good too.
1476727651|5.0|This is a great addition for anyone who is a Stephen King fan and is a long-awaited sequel to one of King's best novels (The Shining).  The story contains lots of what Stephen King fans always look for in a King novel (no spoilers here) and it is well worth a look.  Highly recommended!
0345529057|5.0|All four books are awesome. The second one is hard to keep reading cause there are so many new characters that have to be introduced. Blood guts, betrayal, and  shivelry with sleek cunning keeps you on your toes.  I am ready for more
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is a great movie, not just for children, but for adults too.  It has humor that we can all enjoy.  My labradoodle ate it so I am going to order another one.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  My Grandchildren love it too.  We need more movies like this.  Nickolas Cage was really really good.  They all were. Cloris Leachman  Amazing. This movie gets a 5 star rating and more if I could.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|It's not as funny as the TV show, but very illuminating about our prison system as it relates to women, race, and class. Though the prose does not rise to the level of art, this memoir is well worth reading.
B000067FP8|5.0|Had the 1st movie never knew they had a 2nd great movie love it and my kids liked it a lot great family night movie great price love amazon
0385537131|5.0|Grisham's best.  Other authors might use his model of telling a great story without lusty sex scenes, violence magnified and foul language.  Sycamore Row is a page turner and several friends have purchased it on my recommendation.

B003G8Y4QO|5.0|For anyone new to Doctor Who, this is by far the easiest, best place to start. The storyline really kicks into high gear with this season, and there aren't so many references to past seasons that it makes the viewing difficult. You will, however, be hooked, so consider yourself warned!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun game. Has great graphics. Hard to steer the minion when he is on the rocket. Other than that it's a great game.
B0053ZOQMK|2.0|Tedious for young kids; the mystery/investigation part of the whole plot had some promise early then degraded into something less than your standard &#34;Scooby-Doo&#34; episode.  Some nice action bits, though.  Ugly characters all-round.
B00BUVPIRS|4.0|The app has Xbox 360 graphics and has a awesome story but I am stuck on part five and I keep dieing. Awesome game.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Excellent balance of humor and heart. Ties up lots of loose ends, and leaves us hopeful for the future. Here's to 50 more years of The Doctor!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is great it is just like feeding frenzzy but its with sharks.so much cooler and better. and the diffrent levels of sharks you van her to
B00GYC8YE2|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet by echoing what many fans seem to say: this show is a slow-burner, but if you get through the perfectly enjoyable if somewhat generic first five or six episodes, you're in for a real treat, especially if you're a Whedonverse fan (I loved the recent Easter Egg for &#34;Dollhouse&#34; fans with the &#34;Did I fall asleep?&#34; reprisal).  I felt compelled to rush in with a 5-star review especially because I saw that the execrable and patently idiotic show &#34;Revolution&#34; has an even higher score than this show, which is not only never outright moronic, but the characters are far, far more than likable after only a few episodes, something that never comes close to happening in &#34;Revolution.&#34;  Horrible show, that.<br /><br />Anyway, my 5-star review is just a bit about the show's potential, but also about how vastly the show has improved in recent weeks, almost by leaps and bounds, appropriately.  It still needs a centralized focus to anchor the creature-feature weeks, which is starting to come into view, and the characters need to deepen, which is happening every week.  Beyond that, the show looks gorgeous, and the actors are more than coming into their own.  Any cast with Clark Gregg is going to be worthwhile; he's wonderful and effortlessly charismatic, not to mention hilarious.<br /><br />In even shorter terms: the show is truly finding its groove, and far faster than many other shows that eventually became great.  If you're expecting &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; or &#34;Mad Men&#34; levels of fully-formed series television and incredibly complex and deep subtext, you're coming to the wrong place.  If you're looking for a classical television series that will clearly be worth our while in the long run (and even now, I'd argue), you will be quite satisfied.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a very good game you can get mods play with your friends and IT<br />IS updated to 0.7.6 dummy

B00G70JQZC|3.0|Not as much action as before. Seems they wanted more of a story line. But hey it's the wolverine anyway.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Well written holocaust story with perspective from a small German town. The brave people who lived in day to day fear hiding Jews is well presented.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I am absolutely and completely addicted to this game on my PlayStation 3 console, my android smartphone and also on my Kindle fire Hd.  Im constantly playing it on all devices to maximize my rewards and trophies ane unlocka. Hope they come out more characters as the game ages.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Such a fun game. I have always loved the movies and the game does not disappoint. Only reason I did not give five stars was not being able to rotate the decorations and buildings.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Like to finish catching fire movie? Read this one.  It is the epic conclusion to the trilogy. You will love it
B0013TTLDE|3.0|The story takes place mainly at Riverton, a British estate owned by the Ashburys.  It is told by Grace, a girl who became a servant there when she was 14 years old.  The story alternates between the present when Grace is 98 years old telling a film producer about the happenings at Riverton and the early 20th century when she was a teenager and young adult.  The main characters are Grace and the two girls Hannah and Emmeline Ashbury who lived on the estate.  Grace became the lady's maid for Hannah, the older girl who is about the same age as Grace.  The novel involves two mysteries: who is Grace's father and why did Rob Hunter commit suicide.  Neither is hard to figure out.<br /><br />The first 50% - 60% of the book was rather boring.  It moved slowly and I had a hard time keeping all the relatives straight in my mind.  In the long run, most weren't too important to the plot though.  I was reading this while on a trip and might have given up reading it and read another book, but it was the last one I had to read on my Kindle, so I plodded on.  At that time, I planned to give it 2 or 3 stars.  However, the last part of the book became far more interesting and I felt like it deserved 3.5 to 4 stars, so I sort of averaged them.<br /><br />Despite my contention that the early part of the book was overly long and boring, there were parts near the end that were glossed over.  Still, I did enjoy that part of the book.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book and instantly knew I would need to read this. There are differences between the two but they tie together enough do that you can see/read one and not the other. I would definitely recommend seeing/reading both. I love the endings in both even though they are different. Read the book, see the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|my kids and I love this game. addictive and fun. regenerating chocolates however are not fun though...lol. I love a challenge though.
B004PVKFR8|1.0|Sail is literally the only good song, the rest of the album is terrible. Song after song are just kinda awful.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|Beautiful cinematography, but movie lacks. Only wish it had been more entertaining. A bit pricey for not that good of movie
B000GJPL1S|5.0|Own the movie that changed the world! You ask, why on earth would anyone buy a movie that is over 10 years old? Because it is still relevant? Because it has cutting edge special effects which aren’t only there to dazzle, but actually adds to the story narrative? Perhaps because it is a story that parallels your own life in some way? Buy it as a tutorial, because it explains complex esoteric truths in so simple a way, that even a child can understand? What if I told you, that the imbedded information of this story works to awaken your consciousness? That the arch types represented, are age old place holders which loosen the wheels and cogs of your mind and cause a quantum overload, breaking through the illusion, to expose the truth? What if I told you, that you are the One? You are Neo, and this is your personal map to awakening.<br /><br />All good esoteric training material is written in story, look how Jesus taught. He told relatable stories to illustrate the truth he was presenting. So did Buddha. Both were speaking to a mostly uneducated population. Just about every spiritual adept, who has walked the face of the earth, taught through story. This still works. The Celestine Prophesy is a modern day kickstart of a spiritual movement, told as an action adventure, but revealing new spiritual ideals along the way. When 'The Matrix' came out at the edge of a new age, the age of Aquarius, people were searching. They were hungry for answers, just as Neo is at the beginning, searching for the illusive Matrix. Lives were empty, so was his. Work did not provide the answer, relationships did not provide the answer. Religion provided a narrow view point that did not make sense to anyone with more than a 3rd grade education. We were leaving behind the Piscean age of dreaming and illusion, the time of the dying God, and embracing the rebellious and humanitarian age of Aquarius. This movie marries the Christ myth and the Buddhist philosophy into one narrative.<br /><br />An important consideration to keep in mind, which is not known by the general population, but important for understanding this movie and it’s cosmic message , is that Christianity is not a pure religion. Little history lesson. When the Emperor Constantine of Rome had a city which was half pagan, and half the followers of Jesus, who adhered to a belief called ‘the way,’ he needed a simple solution so that Rome wouldn’t be engulfed in civil strife, and he could remain in power. At the Council of Nicaea, Constantine gathered the holy fathers of both religions and forced them to create a hybrid of the two. This is where the concept of original sin comes in, Jesus never speaks of original sin, if it was an important foundational belief, he would have. The pagan staple, the dying God, a hang over from the sun worshipers whose God dies every sunset to rise again the next day, is established as the true reason behind Jesus’ mission. Sacrifice is a huge theme in pagan mythology and it becomes the core of the Christian belief system even though it’s founder never focuses on it, his focus was actually universal love.<br /><br />Now we have the crux of the story. Each of us must show our ‘sacred face,’ our sacrifice for others, as we face off the antithesis of our awakened selves; our shadow side, the ‘antichrist’ as portrayed by Agent Smith. To follow the convoluted path of the One, it helps to have more than a child’s understanding of the teachings of Jesus. Christ is not the name of a person, it is the name for the connection between an individual and the Divine. To be in Christ Consciousness is to be connected directly to the Divine. The antichrist is again not an individual, but the ego, our shadow selves. The ego is that state where you are not Divinely connected, rather you are seeking gratification of self. Neo and Agent Smith are actually one, which is played out in the next two installments of the Matrix trilogy. The Divinely connected human, battlesthe ego for control. The Ego wants to rule the world but the soul desires connection, a true communion with the Divine. In order to do this, Neo must wrestle with Agent Smith, overcome the ego, the shadow, by becoming one with it, and step into his power of divinely connected human, transcending all illusion.<br /><br />So what has this got to do with you? Everything. True power is not outside of you. Neo illustrates this when he begins to master The Matrix. Stepping back from the illusion, seeing it as a canvas which allows you to create upon it by harnessing your mind, making the mind work for you, rather than allowing the ego to run you with fear dramas. This is the key to enlightenment. At the beginning of the movie we are invited along for the journey of the Christ myth when Neo is told, “you’re my savior man, my own personal Jesus Christ.’ We are told at the start to look through the metaphor, it is all laid out for us plainly. Dreams speak in metaphor, the language of the unconscious, and it is from the unconscious that we must awaken to be present to our own Matrix.<br /><br />Even the names used for the characters are code to engage the enlightened seeker. Morpheus, the God of dreams, is one of your greatest teachers. In dream time many puzzles are solved, many illusions are explained. This is a really powerful name for a powerful player in this story, because the entire point of The Matrix is to awaken from it. It is Morpheus who tells Neo, “you have been living in a dream world Neo.” We are also told that without Morpheus there is no resistance, everything rests on him. Trinity who represents the Divine Feminine, is there to support you, messages from Heaven appear in threes so you know it was Divinely inspired. Cipher, representing the media, will try to lead you astray with false truths because it is there helping Agent Smith, the ego. Cipher pretends to be on your side to inform you, but is actually planning your demise by engaging you in mental games and enhancing the need to gratify the ego. Epoch reminds us that this is a significant story of historical value being retold. Switch tells us that we are going to get turned on, we are going to see the light. The Oracle is a living person, not an ancient prophesy. She is a part of The Matrix, living in both worlds. She is personable, kind, she bakes cookies, she is someone you can interact with and talk with. She is surrounded by children who are gifted adepts, able to manipulate The Matrix at will. She gives each person a key to the puzzle, which in the end, all fit together. She is approachable and speaks plainly even though she is revered by others. Zion, literally God’s house, is where the treasure is, all that is left of humanity, the true wealth of this world, and the only safe place left. The Nebuchadnezzar, the ship Morpheus pilots, is named after a King of Babylon, who destroyed Jerusalem and exiled the Jewish people to Babylon. All these names are significant. By invoking ancient mythological names which act as trigger words, the mind is engaged on a spiritual pursuit long after you have seen this movie.<br /><br />So why all the guns? The temper of our times. Guns and bullets, the great equalizing balance between the powerful and the weak, as long as both sides are well armed. People who live with fear need guns, and the ego deals in fear. So Neo, with the help of Trinity (the Divine) (women are usually so much more connected spiritually than men)  flies to the aid of his mentor to free him, thus creating the crisis which allows Neo to step into his power. Neo goes after Morpheus to rescue his mentor but what Neo is actually doing is to go into sleep, into the illusion, to rescue himself.<br /><br />Crisis is often times, the invitation to transform. Running away from one event, we run towards the very thing which holds our redemption. Whatever you run away from, you will run into. This is what Neo does, he runs right into the confrontationwith Smith, there he goes beyond time and space to emerge as master of both his ego and The Matrix. It isn’t until Neo stops fighting Agent Smith that he calmly says, ‘no,’ then becomes one with his shadow self, accepting his power. This movie is a map to self transformation, if you know how to recognize and understand the symbolism. This is the underlying goal of the movie, to awaken people who are just going through the motions of their life, to a level of mastery where they are co-creators of their own reality. Watch it more than once with this in mind in order to appreciate the subtle nuances, which support all of us in becoming capable of shifting our reality. This is really a movie of the new age, heralding limitless possibilities, where we are the creators of our own worlds.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've bought multiple of these headsets and each seem to have the same problem with crackling and disconnecting would not  reccomend
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I have been waiting for an app that you can create your own Jurassic park. This is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it. This is awesome and the graphics are a 10 in my scale of 1-10.
B00GQ8LUEA|4.0|After suffering through several hit-or-miss previous seasons, this one is much more serious and less gratuitous, with tight writing and fast-moving storylines. I liked the final conclusion, and I thought this season was satisfying overall. Not as funny -- or as gory -- as past seasons. The acting is fantastic in this season, with excellent guest stars -- the guy who plays the star psychopath is perfectly creepy and Charlotte Rampling is of course amazing. Highly recommend!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever and it is awesome so this is my fav game also it is free so this is the best game ever.
B00CQZ65BU|4.0|Fascinating. My grandparents were medical missionaries in China from 1909 to 1934. This gave me a much better understanding of the environment when they arrived, and how hard it must have been for them to live and work in a provincial town in Shanxi Province. In addition, it is a great read for people who have, or are planning to travel in China. I'd just returned from China when I read this book, and it gave me a much greater understanding of what we saw, heard and observed. It certainly provided an alternative view of the Empress Cixi to the standard one given by tour guides in China--basically the unfavorable government position. The book is well-researched and documented and reads well, though it was a bit slow-going at times. It is a much easier read than Jung Chang's book about Mao.
B00701L5XS|5.0|Perfect app for when you forget how to tie a knot .  I use it mostly for fishing knots while i'm in a boat on the middle of a lake, or sometimes learn a new knot in my spare time.  I last used it to see which knots to use to build a cargo net for my daughter's play structure.  Definitely worth a buck or two.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|Even though Tom Cruise doesn't fit the physical profile of Jack Reacher in the novels by Lee Childs, he doesn't disappoint.
B008JFUPFI|4.0|A major reboot for the Superman series...darker...edgier, and very well acted. The only gripe I had was the going back and forth from the present to the past. Other than that, it was a good movie.
B00000J048|3.0|i like that the board can be seperated and re-shaped, but my 4 year old finds it difficult to push them all the way together. There are plastic pins on the bottom of the gears to hold them to the board, but they break easily. The spinning colors are just stickers that will wear off soon. Despite the fustration of lining up everything i like the idea of this toy. I encourage parents to interact and show how precise a geared machine must be to operate.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Good family movie for us. Watched with my 10 year old and then my 18 year old watched later... both kids liked it.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Too many pop-up ads, deleted the app and stuck with an Angry Bird app already on my Kindle. Will try to find a better one on-line.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The words grabbed me from the start.  The young girl filled the pages with joy and anger, with pride and deep seated sorrow.  Man's inhumanity to man burned the pages but the words survived.  I can only say be prepared to fall in love with the story and the characters.  I wept when the story ended.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|i would give this book a hundred stars. I am still crying from the outcome. Very well written book. Favorite of all time
B00006SFLV|5.0|The cinematic feel of one of the greatest shows to ever air on American television is complemented by the performances of an extremely talented cast, and equally talented writes.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Very uplifting and really helps you with dealing with the challenges of life. I listen to all the time when I run.
B00005U122|5.0|Pink Floyd fans broke into 2 camps in 1987:Team Roger & Team Dave. If you are a fan of Roger, you will enjoy this. First of all hearing Pink Floyd classics in glorious 5.1 is well worth the price of the DVD, throw in a very inspired performance from  Doyle Bramhall II and you have 170 minutes of quality entertainment!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|A great Christmas album by a great singer!  Michael Buble rules!  This album had all of my Christmas favorites.  By sure to view the DVD re: the making of the album.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is such an interesting book about witches, warlocks, daemons and vampires!  Its about a woman who has ignored her gift of magic until she is thrown into it by a book she recovers in a library doing research.  It combines time travel and history.  Its fun interesting and well written.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I enjoy playing it as well as my grandchildren.  It is easy to figure out and we enjoy the challenge.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So realistic I love this book so much!!!!!!!I cannot wait to read the next book which is mockingjay The book was just simply AMAZING
B009VMN3RA|4.0|every comment is justified. Shirley proves herself by publishing a book about the same time and goes on televised publicity tours. She says nothing of her daughter. She's the selfish one, not Sachi.
0938045695|4.0|Instead of paying for a gym membership, I decided to order this book, the companion DVD and a 16 kg kettlebell. Over all I have been very happy with my decision. The book and DVD do a great job of describing and showing proper technique for the one-handed swing, get-up, clean & press, and snatch. The book also contains 3 programs to do in succession: the Break-In Program, the RKC Minimum Program, and the RKC Rite of Passage. These programs are designed to take you from first-time kettlebell user to 'a man among men' (Pavel's words) capable of doing 200 snatches with a 24 kg kettlebell in 10 minutes or less. While I am still a ways away from being a man among men, I have made significant progress since I started training with kettlebells. I've gained 20 lbs of muscle over the past year, have gotten considerable stronger, and have a much better work capacity. I intend to keep exercising with kettlebells for the foreseeable future, and I will continue using Enter the Kettlebell! for both technique and programming.<br /><br />The reason I'm not giving the book 5 stars is because (in my copy, at least) a couple of pictures showing the get-up technique are clearly wrong. In each picture in the book showing bad technique, Pavel makes an over-the-top ugly face to make sure you know that is what you're NOT supposed to do. However, in 2 of the pictures which are supposed to show proper get-up technique, Pavel is making an ugly face, and his technique clearly doesn't match the description of how you're supposed to do the exercise. While this isn't the biggest deal for me, since I have the DVD to show me the technique, it is still an obvious flaw in the book that should have been corrected by the editor. So while everything else about the book is worthy of 5 stars, I have to deduct a star for these mistakes.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|As always this is an enjoyable read but it is really a rehashing of other Grisham novels. It like he is recycling stories. Oh well, it's Clanton and adding in Willie Traynor was a nice touch.
B000I186FW|5.0|Love this Movie, watch it every 5th of November! Great Story and great acting, great character Development. It's a Must See.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Catchy,intriguing,heartfelt,mind /memory jolting.<br />Loved it! Will be sharing this one: )<br />I can think of 3 friends I'll be sharing with already!
0316055433|2.0|I was delighted to recommend this book to my reading friends as I whisked through the first 500 pages.  Tartt's attention to detail and Theo's expressions of loss and loneliness were poignant and heart rendering. The plot was engaging. However after sloughing through the long haul to novel's end, I wish I could take those words back.  The very attributes I admired in the beginning became so overblown and self-indulgent by the end I cringed each time Theo went into a self-medicated fog of drugs and alcohol, sickness, or out into the symbolic cold without the proper outerwear.  I wanted to scream, \\" Get over it, get over yourself, wear a warm coat and sensible shoes.\\" The details went on ad nauseum as the plot collapsed into preachy lessons about art and its role in life, yadda, yadda.  Sadly the ending did not deliver on the beginning's fantastic potential and Theo's character never became fulfillingly  human.  The dog seemed more intuitive and likable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazingly great and super addictive I recommend it for anyone and any age<br />It's like temple run but more perks less cons and way easier
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|this product is not that great. it does do what it says but very limited at this time, the Roku is a better buy. I can see buying this after more apps are made for it. but for now I would not recommend it for the non tech person
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Helen Hunt was great in this movie as were John Hawkes and William H. Macy. It was tasteful done as to not scare the horses(as the British would say) and based on a true story. Don't be put of by the sex acts on screen, they are done with good taste, yes Helen Hunt is naked, but what woman hasn't look in the mirror at their own body. What married guy hasn't seen his  wife's body (unless his in the dark). This movie brings to light a problem that some people share sex dysfunction and not being able to have a normal sexual relationship due to fears of sexual acts. I good the movie because I am a Helen Hunt fan, after watching it, I am very glad I purchased it and will watched it again very soon, not just for Helen Hunt but for the movie itself it's a very good movie and stands alone on it's own. Enjoy it, if you buy this movie, I did.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I just didn't like it.  I did not find the characters sympathetic, and  I did not care for the story.
B00GLX1MG6|3.0|The two male actors carried this movie, not a question about it.  I am a Jennifer Aniston fan, but in this movie she was not very resplendent.  The actors were the best / only reason to watch ... even the boy was funny.  Huge disappointment.  Barely worth watching - and certainly not at Amazon's $5 price for non-HD.
B00338QENI|4.0|I chose four stars because the story itself is five star but the writing is three star.  Ms. Skloot deserves credit for bringing this story to light.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is absolutely adorable! It's fun, simple, has incredible graphics and is flat out amazing! I love this game, it is so very addictive, and can take up so much time! I always lose track of time when I'm playing this game. It's perfect for children of ALL ages, and of course us adults can have some childish fun with it too! I love the despicable me movies, and oh the minionsssss!!!! And now they've created a game too!? Awesome! :)
B00F1W1SS0|4.0|Dream Theater's latest live release is another very worthy entry in their much admired catalogue and demonstrates why the band continues to reign as the kings of progressive metal music.<br /><br />If I could, I would rate this release a 4.5.  My only quibble is with the set list, which to me is a little unbalanced, but that is really just a matter of personal preference.  There are already many detailed and well thought reviews here - I won't attempt to compete with those but would like to share a few observations of my own.<br /><br />Unlike some reviewers, I think the sound quality is good.  I have not heard the 5.1 mix but to my ears the quality of the stereo mix is such that I would rank the recording among the best of the band's numerous live releases.<br /><br />In particular, I think the ADToE tracks benefit from this slightly more aggressive and 'guitar prominent' mix. (I thought the orchestral synths were overdone on the studio album).  The band as a whole plays very well throughout and in my view they do not suffer at all - in a live setting  at least - from Mike Portnoy's absence.  They remain a fearsomely powerful - and it would seem very contented - live band.<br /><br />I do find the video editing to be annoyingly fast, but unfortunately that is a relatively standard practice these days and it's one I'm (reluctantly) adjusting to.<br /><br />In terms of the set list, I think the show would have been better had it included a true epic such as Octavarium or A Change of Seasons. Or something from Black Clouds and Silver Linings (preferably the ambitious and majestic Count of Tuscany),  particularly as no live recording have been released from that tour.  But a band with a catalogue as extensive as Dream Theater's will never please everyone and I don't doubt that most fans will find much to enjoy (particularly given the generous inclusion of the alternate tracks).  I know I have.<br /><br />I should add that the packaging on the deluxe version is very good.  The hardcover book which houses the six discs is well constructed and printed on good quality paper and the photos themselves are well done.  Some written reminisces from the band on the tour or perhaps a piece from their biographer would have been a nice touch, but again it is unfair to complain about such things.  Beyond the inclusion of the full show (and bonus tracks) on CD, there is no additional video content beyond that included with the standard Blu-ray or DVD release.<br /><br />In summary, this is an excellent release that serves many worthwhile roles.  It is of course a wonderful document of the \\"Dramatic Turn\\" tour and a fine complement to that album and its fascinating documentary on the recruitment of their new drummer.  It also acts as an excellent introduction to Mike Mangini for fans like (those in Australia) who have yet to see him perform live with the band.  Finally, given the production delays and subsequent quirky timing of its release, it serves to very effectively whet the appetite for the upcoming tour in support of their recent, and very strong, self titled album.  I, for one, cannot wait to see them again.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I can't seem to put this game down. Very addictive. I wouldn't spend money on it but for the free plays you get on a daily basis you can't beat it.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|It is ok. Not super challenging.  Fun just the same. It is good enough to pass the time.  I wonder what other games are like.
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|I have yet to receive this product! This is the longest time I have had to wait on a shipment! The worst! I ordered this almost three weeks ago!!!!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I am a photographer and I use this app regularly! It has all the bells and whistles and is definitely worth downloading!
B0063IH60K|4.0|have had to re-download the app several times due to &quot;unknown error &quot;. Still,  very good and lots of fun.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I had fun playing through the levels. It was not too hard but the animation was good.<br />I would certainly recommend this to a friend.
0553582011|4.0|in great condition and was shipped promptly, have yet to read it but judging by the rest of the series it will be a must read
B002SF9YUM|5.0|I am a fan of Garcia Lorca's work and this film helped to expalin a lot of dark history that took his life.  All of the actors<br />did a great job.  I also recommend a film by Andy Garcia called, &#34;The Disappearance of Garcia Lorca&#34; and a companion.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a great game. I discovered an easy strategy to use. Upgrade so it is really infectious (your disease that is), make sure it has no symptoms. If it develops a symptom, de-evolve it. Make it so it is really infectious, no symptoms, and evolve it so it is drug resistant. Upgrade that up two times. Save up till at least 100 DNA points, then when every last person on earth is infected, upgrade to total organ failure. Then just sit back and watch.
0316055433|5.0|The author jumps into the skin of so many very different people and lets us experience them -warts and all.<br /> I really loved this book.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|It's crazy exciting. You don't know what's going to happen next. The romance was unexpected I really thought it was part of the job.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|HORRIBLE ACTING, PLOT LINE WAS GOOD, BUT TOO MUCH HOLLYWOOD CLICHE, ALL WAS PREDICTABLE.  CHARLIE HUNNAM  SHOULD NEVER ACT AGAIN
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have to say I have waited forever for this game for my kindle and I love it so far it is one of my favorites and I love it
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great game especially if you love bingo or slots. I wish that the cards cost less bingo credits but that is just because I run out so fast.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|The game was very fun I'd reccommend this game to anyone<br />who gets bored with games like temple run. BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|This, so far, is not a murder mystery there's no tension and when I like a book I can't wait to get back to it. This one so far is, I'm getting to it so I can finish it.
B000TGZPOQ|4.0|Not quite as epic as the first album with Marty, but still a great album. I wish Marty would spend more time as a hired gun for established bands - I tend to like his playing better when he's not the only writer.
0064410935|5.0|Such an awesome book! For young and old. I loved it when i was young and i love it now.
B000VBJ504|4.0|Since the two albums came out simultaneously, nearly 30 years ago, everyone and their grandmother has said how much better it would have been if they'd have filtered it down to one album, so I won't waste your time by saying the same thing. Still, some real gems on here - GnR before Axl turned into a giant hemorrhoid - or at least removed any lingering doubts.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Absolutely loved it! They do not make movies like this anymore. It was intriguing and the love story was freshing and a nice touch.
B00FXEL00W|3.0|This book started out very promising but then lost me. I initially liked the charismatic starlet who admits her love for her best friend but as the story continued, her immaturity and homophobia irritated me.  Reading about her dumping her only love so she could hide her homosexuality was depressing.  I also found her lover, her best friend forever, unbelievable, superficial, and not fleshed out as a character in this book. For a teenage reader I suppose this book would be an okay read but I found this story quite boring and cliche ridden.
B009DZDJU6|2.0|Not as great a movie as I though it would be...pretty corny. I would not watch this movie more than once nor purchase the movie for home collection.
B008Y5T5ZE|5.0|Johnny Depp is always amazing. I like movies that have to do with books and this movie which I have seen several times is very exciting.
B00EJX2YGM|4.0|The Ultraviolet digital versions are only downloadable if you live in the US, according to the description. Luckily I managed with VUDU, but it was quite a shock that I wouldn't get the digital versions after all, as I don't have regioncode 1 standard on my computer to watch the DVDs. However, the whole package looks great!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. I recommend it often and recently read it for the second time. It was as enjoyable and maybe even more so than the first time. If you enjoy being swept away in a story this book will definitely not disappoint.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|The story was great. Characters were real and very moving. Writing was impeccable. The only downside is the story is slow at times, but overall a must read for fantasy fans.
B008602KQI|3.0|It's not art. It's not inspirational. It's not educational. But, it's entertaining. You'll enjoy it. Pop some popcorn, kick back, relax and be entertained.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|top notch Bond flick that made me want more...  Plus best music since Barry along with one of the best theme songs.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|Awesome for any digital artist. It works great with a stylus or I stylus paint brush.  If your skeptical like I was before I bought it, take the plunge it is definitely work the price. It is cheaper than buying a drawing pad with paint or pencils.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|IT was exciting fast moving and easy to follow story line which made it typically Bond with a slight twist you will find interesting to say the least.
B000URWYTS|4.0|This was a very well written and researched book. I learned a lot about Frank Lloyd Wright that I had not known, and though Ms. Horan freely admits the personal story is mostly fiction, I suspect she was pretty darn close.
1451627297|5.0|You're often told not to judge a book by it's cover --  well, in this instance that is an incorrect statement.  I was drawn to this book by its graphic cover and intriguing title.  I hadn't read fiction in many years.  Couldn't resist, and wasn't disappointed.  Stephen King doesn't disappoint.
B00G70JQZC|5.0|Movie was great!  The quality and the storyline were on par for a marvel movie.  The details in the movie followed the actual storyline form the comicbook.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|And ode to my favorite Beatle and it doesn't get much better. Paul, Ringo, Clapton, Lynne, Petty, Ravi, Billy Preston, Joe Brown, and on and on.  This is a proper tribute to an artist who changed the world. It's entertaining, sentimental, phenomenal
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This product will not display your pictures and videos from your phone to your TV.  Google intentionally blocked it from doing that because their not making money off it....... Greedy pricks.  Buy an actual Miracast dongle for that not this Chromecast price of s***.
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|Shock the Monkey!!! Who is cooler than Peter Gabriel. Belongs in the royalty Hall of Fame. EVERYTHING  is good by the great Peter Gabriel!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I think this is a reaaly fun app to play.  I just wish you could skip missions like &quot;follow us on twitter,&quot; I hate twitter, nor will I ever get it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Makes a person think. Great game! Puzzle solving. Helps memory skills. You must be able to take time to study and solve. Who ever made this game is a genius.
B00683JK9K|4.0|It's fun. It's got lots of levels of difficulty. The pictures are pretty. It's a good way to spend a half our or so.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|At a really low price i can wirelessly send my desktop to TV.. simply love it... good bye roku and others..
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Warning! Highly addictive! I started playing this, and next thing I knew, it was 2 hours later! So much fun.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Suprisingly good, great affects, a little predictable but over all I enjoyed it.  Not great but  worth the time to watch
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Hard to put down after you get started. Very fun game and addicting. So I'm giving it a five star rating
B00F2362IE|5.0|Best game ever<br /><br />I love teenage mutant ninja turtles and the movies too I just wish I had all the characters
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Funny, action, entertainment. If you like this qualities in a movie well then this is a movie that you must wash.
B001QW8QYS|4.0|Great movie, with great detail.  The love story started off a little bumpy, but was worth it in the end.  Great idea of what 1st Century Rome was like.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|Read in one day! A unique twist kept me intrigued through the whole story.  The character development is awesome, and I may be using this book for character study in the future!
B003B5M0PO|5.0|I chose 5 stars because the story about Joey hit my hart. It is a lovely story, and I sugest it for children from 10 to 14. War Horse decitves 5 stars!
B00C6CHTX6|3.0|Incredible view of Hitler's thinking considering how he implemented his plans; but difficult reading due to his lecturing style and extreme opinions.
B00D1VKZ3M|5.0|Striking story about the dwindlings of mature love life and hilariously funny description of the hi's and low's connected to this!
B00F91H666|3.0|The movie was good. Brad Pitt's acting was solid. Fast-paced, but not a lot of interaction with zombies on a personal level, if that makes sense. More run-n-gun on Brad's part as he scours the world (in a short amount of time) to do what he's best at. I won't give it away. A different kind of zombie apocalypse in that it's shown on a global scale.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The story line is interesting and the acting is excellent.  I like seeing how the characters are woven together with the different stations in life that are being played out.
1616551151|3.0|Nice artwork and summaries of the countries and cultures of the world of Dragon Age. Like a gazeteer with countries and histories described and fashion and culture of different races and factions of Dragon age universe.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Extraordinary portrayal go a five-year-old. I never wanted to put it down. Makes one see and sense the world as if for the first time.
B00C1MLHRA|5.0|ignore what the negative reviewers said.  They are ignorant.  This may not be my favorite album but the blu ray is top notch audio quality.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Great number puzzle game. Requires thought without being so hard that it turns you off to the game. Android needs more quality apps like this.
B006WVVA28|5.0|Great power, Install was completely problem free, perfect processor for my budget on an asus P9x79 board with 32gigs and a GTX76 vcard..  Did not come with a cooler of any type.
B00FN3HRG4|1.0|I guess when I saw the heavily-retouched cover I should have suspected that the audio and video would also have been monkeyed with. I agree with all the other reviewers: this is poor quality but I think it's because of all the filtering they use to hide the many imperfections in the performances. Someone said that if you are as vain and paranoid as Miss Streisand, now that people have HD TVs the performers have to go through a lot of processing so that you can't see every pore. Also the audio has to be equalized so that the singing sounds smoother than it really was during the live shows. It's really a rip-off when you think about it. Anyone remember Judy Garland? Her performances were the REAL thing. That gal WORKED. What you hear on HER live recordings is the way it happened. And it's thrilling, imperfections and all. It's gotten to the point, for me, where I can no longer enjoy listening to or watching Barbara because I always feel like she is trying to fool me. I mean, just look at this cover! She's 20 again? And her boobs don't sag even at 75! Give me a break!  Anyway, didn't enjoy this. It's in my pile of thrift-store donations.
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|I love tom selleck and the jesse stone series are great. Hoping for another one to see what happens in Paradise.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Awesome history/documentary. Also a totally kickass soundtrack. It's Very well<br /><br />put together. Lots of stories within the story. Highly recommended!
B00EUGYM04|5.0|all of the best on the set. Have been waiting for some time for the release. Excellent Christmas gift to myself..
B00DHBOQMM|5.0|Another offering from Michael Connelly featuring Michael Haller and upto the standard of his previous stories. The plot moves smoothly with Haller defending his client , sometimes only just legally , and with good story twists. Doesn't disappoint.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the first two books but I really felt like the author took a 180 here. The book completely changes the plot line and in my opinion I don't really like it. She is still a great author but I was just bummed that this was her last book in this series.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Love the movie in theatres. Love the movie in Blue Ray. Movie sucks on Amazon Prime. The download version is just not capable of keeping up with the action, thus the picture fades and distorts throughout. The movie is Great!!! Just don't downlaod it on AMazon Prime.
1451666179|5.0|This is a SUPER quick read, but worth every minute. Funny, touching and just brilliant.  I'll definitely read it again.
B008Y7J1Y2|5.0|Ok...so I have seen this movie at least 10 times, and it never...ever gets old. All of the characters work beautifully together...I even liked Cameron Diaz, and I am no Diaz fan. But the story line gets you hooked almost immediately, especially with Kate Winslet's character. And Jack Black...c'mon it's Jack Black. You got to love him.
1250038820|5.0|I have HONY on my Facebook and I love the Photos and the texts. I had to have the book.
1439152810|4.0|The Secret Keeper is a good book, a little slow starting but once it picks up, keeps you engaged. The characters are portrayed with many layers to their personalities. Reading the book gives you a sense of getting to know the family. There is a plot twist that is revealed at end of the book but can be figured out sooner if you pay attention to the clues.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham Keeps you on the edge of your seat because you are hit with surprises in every chapter and you cannot put the book down.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I had not played this game before now. It has been an adventure as well as the adventure of the game. Try it you will love it too. As I have. Enjoy.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Book was purchased used. It arrived in great condition. Purchased book for my daughter. I have had a great experience purchasing used books through Amazon and will continue to do so.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|fun game easy to play and not a huge demand for real money. lots of upgrades and robots to choose from.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|Great document viewer for cellphone use. For tablets I recommend Polaris Office or KingSoft Office. Documents To Go goes back to the day of the PDA and is good for quickly viewing documents on a small form factor device.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|It was a disaster. Boring. No story. Ridiculously emotional sometimes, when it shouldn't be. I regret I watched it. Laurence Fishburne was the only good actor.
B004G606K8|5.0|This was one of my favorite series, and now my wife has discovered it.  As she recently said, Weis & Hickman keep the focus on the action and aren't afraid to let time pass and assume the reader can keep up with the jumps in the timeline.  If you haven't read these stories yet, check it out, already!
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|It deleted all my progress because I had not been on it for a month and kind of sad sometimes.
B000W4HIX6|5.0|I bought this to be part of a gift basket of Christmas movies and snacks.  I know you're asking yourself, &#34;Why the h*** did he buy Die Hard for a Christmas basket?&#34; This is the QUINTESSENTIAL Christmas movie - the party that gets taken hostage is a Christmas party, and John McClain uses holiday wrapping tape at the end to make his back holster.  And McClain is like Santa - he sees the bad guys when they're sleeping, he knows when they're awake; he knows if they've been bad or good, and you'd better be good, for goodness sake, or he'll throw you off a skyscraper...
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read..  :) could not put it down..love how it was told from the soul take....
B000HL2J0G|1.0|The video feed was choppy.  The audio was ok, but the video frequently paused every few seconds.  I only watched the pilot episode.
B0029QRA1U|1.0|Very poor sound quality. We returned it for a more expensive product. I would get a product where the turntable is the same diameter as a 33 record
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|awesome- the best superman ever. seems more realistic than past movies in the franchise. Can't wait for a sequel. Yea!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google has got to be the fastest and best search engine i know of , this is perfect for anyone , looking up anything
B006MW3V6U|5.0|best period- totally addicting! Cast is amazing- to location is impeccable. I hope this lasts for 10+ years!!!!!! Never get tired of it!
1932100660|5.0|Everyone should read this book! I have given it as a gift to at least 10 people and it always amazes them and nearly always inspires them to change their diets. This book saves lives and makes lives better.
B00F880BWG|5.0|This series is always about impossible choices, and they consistently find new ways to ramp up the tension. Last season the walkers had faded to the background for much of the narrative, but they are back in strength this season (due in part to AMC relaxing their stranglehold on the budget).
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Superb re-do of the movie, the sound and colors are excellent.  Really transformed; and better than it ever was back in the day I originally saw it.
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|When I started this game I thought &quot;Oh no, not another bubble wrap game,&quot; but this game is different. It has a funny storyline, unique combat system, upgrades, and so much more. In the past, it was very glitchy and would crash on the kindle easily, but it has quickly improved and I hope to see it improve even more.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|nice game very well balanced for A rpg I had lots of fun playing all the chars. I give it 2 thumbs up.A must play
B001O5LVPI|5.0|my kids and I absolutely LOVE this movie! I am also a HUGE elvis fan!!!!! We have watched this several times since we have gotten it! :)
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I have really enjoyed this game, it's only downfall is it needs to last longer with more levels. I would recommend this game to everyone.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I was sorry when the book ended since I liked it so much. It's science fiction that demonstrates the genius of the author who creates a world from the depths of his fertile imagination.
B00005AXKF|1.0|I ordered the wrong version.  Didn't realize I ordered the German version.  Can I return it??  Still trying to find the English Version.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|It kept me reading and interested the whole time. Reminiscent of Jane Eyre. Alot of twists and turns to keep you up all night reading.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|This CD was a gift and the receiver is always listening to it as she loves him. She's hard to buy for sometimes so I aced this one.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I was a history major in college so of course I like the &#34;Saga&#34; style books. I found it to be easy, enjoyable reading.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! I was a fan but after this album I am a super fan. It's rare to find a cd that you like every song... this is one of them for sure.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|save your marriage....learn these basics and it can help you and your mate feel more loved<br />and here are the four more words amaz requires
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Tons of fun to play and no problems with the Kindle Fire HD...highly recommended...as good as the full version... awesome graphics.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Amazing app! Completely free, no ads and you are learning your target language in a super fun, easy way. As an aspiring second language teacher I can really appreciate the way this app works and teaches you. You are not allowed to move onto the next lesson/unit until you've passed a certain grade, ensuring that you're learning. Absolutely wonderful- I work on it all the time, even when I'm disconnected from the Internet. If I am going to spend time on apps, this is the best.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun easy to load weeks of fun. Fun way to relax and pass time . Works great on my kindle and Amazon makes it all easy
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game. Both challenging and fun to play. I liked the challenge of beating the first games to unlock other games. For a free game I think it is very good.Hard to find a free game of this quality. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B008EKMB82|4.0|This book was well-written. The storyline was very interesting enough to hold my attention span. The character build was good and so were the choice of words. It deserves its laurels.
0385486804|5.0|It t ook a little while to receive the book, I can't really complain since the book was only a penny,
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Not my idea of what a good game is. Much too young for a senior citizen to play. Look for better game.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Something about The Floyd's music is so calming, and yet it rocks.  It seems like a mix of slow rock, jazz, and some &#34;modern&#34; music (complete with ambient sounds, muffled talking, and so on) all rolled into one album.  There is a reason it is a classic, and still sells copies. It appeals to today's teens, as well as the middle-aged folks who remember when it came out. Timeless!<br /><br />The remaster doesn't take anything away from the original quality.
B001CD6FKI|4.0|I found this movie to be a playful homage to the cartoon it was based on. I didn't go into the movie with the expectations of seeing anything but a live-action cartoon, and that's what we got. If you liked Speed Racer as a kid, you should enjoy this movie. if you are expecting 'Fast and Furious' you need to stick with that franchise and not look for it here. This is campy and cute and cartoony ... just what I remember from it's source material.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This is all I expected from the most powerful female voice in years! I viewed a video of her first performance before her career began and I am forever a fan without reservation!
B00G2SIW7M|3.0|As a fairly big fan of Arcade Fire, I was more than happy to download this new release, HOWEVER, half of the songs don't musically reach to their full potential. I've listened to this album while driving hoping that i could understand it in the entirety and love it in much that same way as I have loved other Arcade Fire albums. Dissappointed.<br /><br />Best to download IMO<br /><br />Reflektor<br />Here Comes The Night Time II<br />We Exist<br />It's Never Over (Hey Orpheus)<br />Porno
B0026P3G12|5.0|This CD is to become one of my favorites of Susan Boyle. I could listen to her for hours; and will as soon as I collect more of her enchanting music.
B00BATG18K|5.0|If Amy Tan writes it, I will read it.  An interesting look into another culture in another time.  Fascinating development of characters and plot twists.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|OMG this book had me on the edge of my seat the entire read. I have not as of yet watched the series and have intention to do so till i finish the read. already have the second book and loving it so far.
B00755MHXG|5.0|Brilliant book. A story of courage, cruelty and compassion, beautifully written. The reader cannot fail to be moved. A must read.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|GREAT movie! Great story, great action...can't wait for RSII!! Coming next year..I hope Atom is still in it, too. :-)
B004OA6KIS|5.0|If I ever get a tattoo, it will be a Feynman diagram - that said, this bit of Mr. F's life does not disappoint, and having lived the Challenger disaster, and having seen the TV adaptation of this book, I can recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what all the fuss is about regarding science and what most people discount as those &#34;eggheads and nerds&#34; who enjoy science.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|it Is a awesome game you have to play it but if you don't your mean an you wont have friends
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Straightforward, not clouded or biased by any previous religious expectations, the author himself was surprised by his experience.<br />A neurosurgeon, the author describes his NDE (near death experience) with both the scientific and personal accounts of his out-of-body adventure in what we can only call &#34;heaven&#34; or after-death experience.<br />Life continues after death in a totally unexpected way though consistent with other accounts by those who have experienced a near-death episode. Predictably, fear of death disappears, and the person emerges with an enormous sense of peace and purposefulness for his real life experience.<br />This is a good, life-affirming read for both those with and without a religious conception of the afterlife.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Hilarious!!!!  Just shows, people are so judge mental. I cracked up , our teens cracked up.  Tucker and Dale are sweethearts.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is an great app no crashes and love the levals and the screen shots would recommend for all ages and easy to play my three old loves it
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Extremely funny program with great stop motion action. My wife does not see any humor to it so guys you know it must be great.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is really great for people who don't have the time or money to go hunting because it has great graphics and many interesting variables.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The author mesmerizes readers with his characters and their stories- a fascinating read! I highly recommend that everyone read it!
6302158095|5.0|Classic disney film and a must have! Sometimes it's nice to pop in a vhs instead of a dvd. Brings you back!
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|This game had me stumped a few times but each puzzle is solvable but does require thinking outside of the box.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I got the app for my grandson and bought keys to get another outfit. It went through twice and never appeared on the app. Amazon helped me get them but then with 24 keys left I bought some coins and got the same error message to down load again.  I did and synced it twice, finally got the coins but lost the keys, so if I let him keep it, we get nothing else unless we have no coins and no keys. Hard to get a 5 year old to understand that.  ABSOLUTELY FRUSTRATING GARBAGE!!!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Entertaining, the energy runs out too fast though, but helps you relax for a little while. It's worth a try.
B00D23K0MU|5.0|Maysa doesn't disappoint on this CD!  It starts off smooth and sultry and builds from there!  I am loving this CD!
B0059XTUVI|5.0|Meryl Streep is exceptional in this film. She is truly one of the most talented method actors of our generation.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was a real page turner and I have been recommending it to everyone!  I have read a bit of Stephen King in the past, but am not really a horror story follower, so stopped reading King's books.  The way he takes Jake/George back in time in 11/22/63 is absolutely amazing!  I love the sub stories he put in -to make George a real person and to include his relationship with Sadie added to the plot.  To have George telling Sadie snips of the future, but not being able to explain to her how he knew these things was GREAT.  I enjoyed the way George followed Oswald, his wife and daughter over the years.  If you want a good book to read, I would HIGHLY recommend 11/22/63 - one of the best I have read in years!!
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|It is a great for killing time waiting or cure boredom. My little one and I love to play thus together!
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Puzzles were not too difficult. It was a little annoying having to back track so often but If you want a time consuming game then this one is for you.
006202406X|1.0|After reading the first two books in the series with well developed plots and characters, I was disappointed with Allegiant on several levels. The underdeveloped fringe, government, Chicago experiment and eliminating a main character when the sacrifice was unnecessary are just a few of the issues I had. Sad waste of my time.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Christopher Eccleston was a fabulous Dr. Who.  There was something strong and assuring about him, and it was a great shock to me when his season ended so soon.  I think he should have gone on longer.  I would have put him up there with the best.  The shows are funny, satisfying, and his working with Billie Piper as Rose was just right.  He was a superior Dr.  One of the best things about Dr. who is the personalities it captures with each individual Dr.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Its ok. My son plays it a lot. He seems to like it. I've played it as well. Its very addicting.
B003NS2T9G|3.0|I watched this of course because I have been a Dr. Who lover for over 30 years.  But without the Dr. It just didn't cut it.  I found the ideas ok, but there was a lot of unwhovian violence and Captain Jack, cute as he is, just was not a strong enough character in his own right to carry the show.
B00GINENG0|5.0|When he is a kitten he is so cute. It is so cool that you can customize him how you want.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Well I liked the last one before the update better because you didn't have to buy anything but I still like this one sky because you have more of a selection of songs.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love to play this game but I don't like that it wants me to buy lives to keep playing or let them have access to my friends emails.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Good game no flaws as I see at the time. I will continue to play everyday. I was waiting for it to come out on my kindle so I can play it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|In the last Deer Hunting game by these guys, you had to pay in Glu credits if you wanted anything good.  In this one, about 90% of the things you can buy can be bought with in-game earned cash.  As always great graphics and good variety of weapons.  I think my favorite part is the slow motion view of the round-winning shot.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It keeps me entertained for hours. Most games are hard to play when your not buying money on them, but this one's isn't to bad.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is an amazing app. You can get awesome unlocks for the console version. Any fan of injustice should get this app.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is a great game and an improvement to tablet games. With great graphics, fighting dynamics and  a huge amount of characters.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|morbid, fun, hilarious symptom combos. glad I bought it. very strategic and requires actual thought put into it. difficult and fun. the update didn't screw anything up. :) I recommend this to everyone who gets addicted to strategic games.
B00FQMZ5M0|5.0|Excellent movie, engaging for adults as well as c children. Animation is unbelievable. Saw it in the theater and had to purchase as soon as it came out.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|I'm not very far but I like it so far:) a little confusing. needs more tutorial in the shop and stuff. so complex I feel like I was thrown into the thicket of things with no help. I have not played number one.<br />if you like this I recommend Army of Darkness Defense. a similar but not quite as well done game.
B004K6HA8K|4.0|I chose a rating of four because this movie does a great job showing how alcohol not only affects the person who is abusing/dependent upon it, but how it can also effect the entire family.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really a awesome book an totally could read it for a day it was a best-selling award,winning and,of course new fave.<br />A must read.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Wonderful books...I only wish I knew how they all fared. We need another book, an epilogue if you will, with the final stories of those we have learned to care about: Tyrion & Danaerys especially.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|in love candy saga it's very addictive all I do is play it I just get mad when I run out of energy
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I really enjoyed this, hope the American version is as good. Great acting and story very moving. I loved it!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Can't use your phone as a WiFi connection. Woulda been nice to know that up front. Ughhh spent two hours to trying to hook up
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I knew katniss was doomed.  All thing attached was destroyed, her first love, her district, and finally nearly her. So you can imagine my surprised at the final outcome. But, readers need to complete this series
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Surely, a classic for all ages.  It is no wonder that so many movies have been made of this classic
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|What happens when you get to the last game...my life will be so empty.  Such a fun and challenging game,  hope you have a sequel ....Thanks for all the FUN!!!!!
B00FB029IU|5.0|Jake Bugg's second outing is a blast.  &#34;Slumville Sunrise&#34; has an astoundingly emphatic drumbeat and Bugg's vocals part sneer, part swagger, &#34;In every bruise, every flower, illuminated by the dawn.&#34;  Breaking a rock & roll speed barrier, &#34;What Doesn't Kill You&#34; rocks out an eyelash over two minutes while it covers a mugging and a broken love affair.  &#34;Me & You&#34; is a lovely track that slows the pace a bit, allowing us to tune into Jake's expressive vocals sheltering his love from the spotlight, &#34;Just you believe me, I'll hide you discreetly from this cruel world.&#34;  &#34;Kingpin&#34; rocks with bravado, &#34;I don't care about tomorrow; I'm kingpin for today.&#34;  &#34;Kitchen Table&#34; is a melodic midtempo track laced with romantic anxiety, &#34;Out from the darkness, your heartlessness haunting my future, Down on all fours you bark bright at the descending moonlight.&#34;  &#34;Shangri-La&#34; is an exceptional set which should cement a strong following Jake Bugg.  Enjoy!
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|Fantastic planning tool that helps you organize thoughts and attack your goal.  Will use this information over and over again.
B00007KGCW|5.0|My daughters loved this movie as children. I was please to find it for my grand daughter at a reasonable price.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really. like this game. but sometimes i can't send or receive games. I hope the next update will fix it.
0788859544|5.0|My daughters loved this movie when it first was released. I was happy to find it for my grand daughter for a good price.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I absolutely love it! This game is fun, interesting, challenging, and addicting!  Just not in the way that requires rehabilitation.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Like millions of others, I cannot put this game down. Even the most difficult levels keep me coming back for more. I don't remember what life was like without Candy Crush Saga.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|More like 3.5 stars.  Not up to the level of the better John Grisham's but pretty good.  Brings back the characters of his earlier book which was better.  The plot is good, but the verdict is too unbelieveable.
B00G3HSF7O|5.0|Does this story remind anybody of anything?? I see a lot of interesting parallels with REALITY. This is how the world really is with one sad difference so far. The trend is still funneling the wealth to the rich. Let Elysium teach us a lesson. This movie is very nice. What a gem. Great story. Unbelievable special effects. Wonderful acting. Not predictable. Fun and entertaining. 5 stars!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really wish the new update would cum out I to be able to get boats and mining carts and wolves and enderman let's go already it's already on android I don't no y it's not on my device yet I'm ready for it
B000HKYOK0|5.0|As a fan of this series from its' beginning, I feel it would be a betrayal, of sorts, to rate this show as anything but 5 stars.
B00F91H15W|5.0|I loved it Great Buy I am very satisfied with this purchase and I would  recommend it to all my friends
B005544TRQ|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised in this show.  Good characters.  They are not as flat in personality as in other &#34;lawyer shows.&#34;  They seem like real people because real people have a great range of personalities.  In other shows the characters seem to be too controlled, unnatural sometimes.
B00AFAHUXU|5.0|I loved it.  Great Buy I am very satisfied with this purchase and I would  recommend it to all my friends
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|My daughter loves everything about Tinker Bell.  I have become a fan as well due to the fact that we watch each movie just about three times a week.  Hopesfully the BluRay edition will make her experience better.
B004OA6KIS|4.0|I read the book becuase of the Science Channel's movie on Challenger, since it was based in part on this book.  There are significant differences between what Feynman says un this book and what was in the movie.  The gist was the same but the movie is not accurate.<br /><br />I beleive I had read &#34;Surely You're Joking...&#34;, before not this one.  Many of the stories were familar including the heartbreak of Feynman's first wife.  I enjoyed the book and reading of Feynman's thoughts and experiences.  I am trained as a physicist and appreciate and understand many of his opions and observations.  Overall it is a good read.  There are times when Feynman seems full of himself, but he is brillant and a Noble Prize winner.
B007MDB548|5.0|My daughter loves everything about Tinker Bell.  I have become a fan as well due to the fact that we watch each movie just about three times a week.  Hopesfully the 3D-BluRay edition will make her experience better.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|This is Lou Reed's last recording. You have to like it now even if you don't. Because Lou died and broke my heart. And I have to accept this recording now. And if you like Lou Reed you should too. You have no choice.
0061950726|3.0|I found it interesting that while the author was working through all of the terrible Indian stereotypes people have created, she gleefully emphasizes all of the terrible republican stereotypes. The hypocrisy became a humorous theme and distracted me from the rest of the book. The story itself felt very rushed, especially given all that happens in the final chapters. I also felt that while Vivian had many redeeming qualities, Molly mostly had none. It's a quick, easy read if you're looking for that sort of thing, but a biography about the orphan train would be more redeeming for those interested.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive, the only thing is there should be something so you could earn the power ups instead of having to buy them....
B0074MZSWW|2.0|Great band but the recording quality did not bring out their true greatness!!! The youtube recordings are much better believe it or not. I hope they rerelease a better version.
0307352153|4.0|Though I struggled getting through this book, the information was fascinating and quite encouraging to an introvert.  Cain shows how US society is slanted towards rewarding extroverted behavior, yet sometime at the expense of better results.  Her section on group decision making was very interesting, questioning corporate culture’s current trajectory.  She also does a nice job showing that we all have parts of our lives where we are introverted and parts where we are extroverted.  Most people are surprised that I’m an introvert, and this idea normalized some of what I’ve observed.  If you are an introvert, or have an introvert that is close to you, this book will be very helpful.
B001QKSWOE|4.0|Her books other than the numbered books are only &#34;like&#34; because they just don't have the oomph!, the &#34;punch&#34;, that her numbered books possess.  Don't ask me why, but they just don't.  And her love stories suck!  She should stick to her regular numbered books, unless she can come up with characters who are as equally enchanting.  Even her story lines aren't as good in these un-numbered books.  I wonder why.
B0086700CM|5.0|My first experience with games on my Kindle.  I'm a Nonna that is trying to stay current with my grand kids.  They are way ahead of me but I'm enjoying this basic game.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Not my favorite James Bond movie, but pretty cool overall.  Of the three Daniel Craig movies, this was my least favorite, but still a movie worth watching more than once.
B00AH8VU0Y|3.0|This is a four for content, addicting series,with strong cast. One star deducted for the atrocious delivery. There are some serious software problems with streaming and downloading. Not only is is slow but in a fast paced episode like this one, I was able to lose the thread completely. Go with the DVD
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Definitely the worst of the Die Hard movies.  There were a couple of great action scenes (like the car chase), but overall I don't see this being one to re-watch like the others.  I actually regret paying to rent it, and wish I would have waited for it to show up for free!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|very good book.  It had a lot going on and I could hardly put the book (well, Kindle) down. Recommend it for anyone
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|Easily my favorite Hitchcock movie.  Every time I watch this one I enjoy it and after seeing it several times, I still look forward to watching it again.  We recently watched it with our 13 year old son, and he even liked it.  Good story, good suspense, never gets boring.
0385743564|4.0|Another great tale of people with super powers from BS. A believable consequence of people being gifted with powers becoming corrupted by their superiority. I didn't care for the first person viewpoint.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|When an ensemble cast is involved, it seems the potential for disaster can actually multiply. Not so in this ensemble movie. In this case, more characters actually means a better movie. I was looking for something to watch on Thanksgiving, and I had vaguely heard some sort of buzz from critics and friends alike that this flick was one of the good ones, as far as this genre goes. I wasn't disappointed, as I was unable to predict how things would unfold, develop, or end. While the good guys do, of course, win, the battle they must wage is heart-stoppingly terrifying -- and totally entertaining. In the process, the über-villain Loki manages to get the upper hand enough times that when he's finally flummoxed, the results are delicious. The Hulk is a favorite in this one.
0800141849|5.0|Romantic and love the story line.  Barbara adds her own flair and the other actors did well.  It was great to see Lauren Bacall!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Kind of a bummer. I only got to level 8 before they started wanting me to ante up to continue play.. it is easy to get hooked on this fun game but be prepared to pay or quit. This is pretty scammy
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Awesome. High current charger for all iPads and iPhones. I even charge my USB air card on it at the same time. I will be buying another one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is is awesome it is  a game of fun and brain work awesome game I recommend this for someone who is looking for fun and a challenge at the same time.
B00G70WLJA|3.0|Some great computer graphics, fun with Ninja, but all in all this is still just a very long exercise in nothing all too compelling. I fell asleep while watching, three times in fact. That is usually a strong indication that the movie has serious lapses. It seemed like it lasted 3 hours or more. I just can't get into the whole X-Men thing, especially Hugh Jackman. Don't forget, if you watch it, to stick around for the after credits scene at the end that sets us up for the next &#34;exciting&#34; Wolverine adventure. I'll opt out !
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|So far, this has been a very nice app, very helpful. Easy to use, and clear as to what it's doing. Would be perfect if it worked on Silk browser history.
B0050PYNP8|4.0|I expected this to be more of a stupid comedy (which I do sometimes enjoy), but it was surprisingly well done
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row by John Grisham<br />  I just love John Grisham so anything he writes I read and always love them. He keeps you wanting to turn page after page.
B006KAWI2C|5.0|Just what my husband asked for.  YEAH, he will be quite happy.  I can't wait for him to open up his presents on Christmas now.
B00CKOQC9C|4.0|Classic book, nothing quite like it.<br /><br />Good intro in this edition by the author explaining how he wrote it.<br /><br />It appears that compared to a 1980s paperback edition, two stories (\\"The Fire Balloons\\" and \\"The Wilderness\\") have been added, and one  (\\"Way In the Middle of the Air\\") has been deleted.  The deleted story used racial slurs in the mouths of characters with racist attitudes, and perhaps this was one reason the story was omitted.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been jealous of my spouse's nook because she could play Candy crush saga and I could not.  I am now once again believing that my kindle fire is superior. Thank goodness.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|The initial story line appeared to be sound and could possibly be interesting. But the author's treatment of the characters and twisted scenarios left me cold and disgusted. I never actually got to book five, having given up and abandoned the story on book two. There are good sword and sorcery tales out there but this is not one as far as I am concerned.
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|Enjoyable for the kiddos, a little nod to us parents who grew up in arcades in the 80's....just get the standard definition for this one tho.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great logic game for all ages. The precision is good, and they've got the graphics and effects working well. Get this game.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock is the master of suspense!  The music helps create the tension and, of course, there's a nice chase scene along the French coastline.  He always adds a bit of humor, too.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|We love this movie!  Saw it on TV and we just had to have it so we could watch it agin and again.  We also passed it around to friends.  The message is what we love. Great for teaching older children so values.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Classic Hitchcock...Cary Grant at his best.  Grace Kelly is a beauty. Fun to try to find Hitchcock in the movie...pretty easy to spot him.
B0018M6J90|3.0|sweet story of a mentor/fairy godmother (with no magical powers and down on her luck) meeting and helping Amy Adams character navigate the water between love and commerce. all the actresses/actors were great and I especially enjoyed Frances McDormand and Amy Adams' chemistry. also fun to see a woman juggling several suitors and trying to decide between them. story was sort of like a female buddy film. only thing I didn't like was when Miss Pettigrew bumped into Michael and freaked out and abandoned all her clothes. her reaction was too extreme and unbelievable given her situation. other than that, nice story. 3 and a 1/2 stars.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Continuing source of original material.<br /><br />Captivating characters  from the villain Louis Litt to the Hero Harvey and his side kick Mike
B004132HZS|3.0|it was okay, liked it well enough. actors are good. not sure what's lacking, but something is, maybe that I just don't get Sherlock. It's not that he's not vulnerable enough, though he isn't, it's that I don't understand his character, what drives him. actors have good chemistry, well worth watching. 3 and a half stars.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I AM A HUNTER, AND I CANT HUNT ALL THE TIME. A PERFECT GAME TO PASS UNTIL HUNTING SEASON. 5 STARS.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It was so wonderful to read a very different kind of story by the King.  I was impressed with the characterizations of the historical people and I could hardly put it down.
034580404X|5.0|Haven't read the books yet but have heard a lot about them. Looking forward to starting to read during the holidays. Books arrived in excellent condition. Like new. Received in a prompt manner.
B00GTZJLAK|4.0|I didn't watch it. I rented it for my grandson. He loved it.I am sure it was a good movie,by the things he told me about it.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|This was a good book. I've certainly read better by John Grisham. It will hold your attention but I wouldn't call it a page turner. The ending is very appropriate.
B00EW79Y0O|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen about growing up.  The film has aged well and the dialogue still sounds vital.  As a fan of bicycle racing, I enjoyed the way the story incorporates the sport as a metaphor for life and developing one's own identity.  The movie also examines class issues and upward mobility.  The credits state the entire film was made on location in Bloomington, Indiana, which adds  to its power, using real locations and some actual people from the university.  Breaking Away is devoid of phony sets. To me, this film, seemingly simple at first viewing, has endured because of heartfelt, enchanting performances coupled to a unique and engaging Oscar-winning screenplay.  When it was released in 1979, I saw it 3 times in the theater.  Seeing it again this month, I was moved once more by the magic of this beautiful movie.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is a nice way to spend a little time. The graphics are pretty good. I do wish I had a stylus to use though. Not to difficult.
B00A196SE2|5.0|I was absolutely addicted to this show.  I could not stop watching it. It was interesting to watch all of the different relationships the main characters had.
B008JFUPOY|1.0|What the hell Amazon I waited over an hour for this Black Friday deal because I thought it would be good. I wake up at 7:25 because it said that it was going to start at 7:30 but then they moved it to 7:50 I was disappointed but I waited and then when it was time and I tried to add it to my cart, it wouldn't let me because it was already full after 30 sec. It wouldn't even let me see the deal. After that i was angry but I gave it one more chance and added my self for the waiting list. And after more then an hour at staring at the screen it when back to the normal price it didn't even say &#34;sorry the deal is closed&#34;. I couldn't believe it I decided to do all my Black Friday shopping online because I didn't want to deal with lines and because I like going on Amazon and all I needed to finish my shopping is this item but if they wouldn't even try to give me a fair chance or telling me i couldn't get instead of me trying to wait and hopping i would get it I might as well go to a actual store and try to get it which I will have to now. This really hurt my chances of buying from amazon again
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|Fabulous album.....wasn't a John Legend  fan until I heard &#34;All Of Me&#34; on the radio.  I was hooked and had to have the album.  I am a professional musician and a picky listener, but I would say this is one of the best love song CD's to come out in a couple of decades.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I liked this game  a lot but I want to know how to add my map in servers like survival games so someone please write a rivet how to put your map on
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|I dont know why, but there is something about this movie that makes it one of those that you will not get sick of. The kind you can watch more than once. Action filled and fun.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is really fun! I think the graphics are amazing and that their better then the first game! I believe this game is super fun :D
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Everything was good abut this show.  Loved it but then I love history,,,made my interest peak and search out more info on the subject
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very easy to play! Family will love it, I love it, it's Fantastic! My friends ans I have a blast playing this game!
B00BC254I8|1.0|I attempted to read this book but just could not stomach it.  I am ashamed of our society. MikeTyson is a batterer of women and a rapist. I grew up in a home filled with physical, emotional and sexual violence.  I too could have found a million reasons to become a violent offender. We have rewarded this psychopath enough.  Would you want him dating your daughter? Would you trust him with your grandaughter? He offers up many excuses in this poorly written book. I borrowed the book and feel cheated at that.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|You get to make your own park instead of people telling you what you need to put on your island  and they have a whole bunch of dragons that you can breed some are common and some are rare. It is latterly the best game in the universe.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|great game. highly recommended for anyone that likes hunting or hunting games. get this app. you won't regret it. four stars
B008K8VDPU|5.0|It is great and all but i get to inpatient to do it so  thats all i have to say
B003PBB4ME|5.0|really like the way it stabilizes the camcorder. People are always asking me what it is. I allows me to hold the camcorder steadier.
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|The game is good and all, but I was just playing it when it said can't load out  the perks. I was so mad I just lost 350 coins!!! But if you are going to get it, it's a good game just don't get 350 coins and  waste them on perks.
006202406X|3.0|The book is worth reading for anyone who started the series.  It differs from the initial storyline in my opinion.  I knew the third book would have problems when we learned that the world was artificial.  That left  only two real options a forced experiment or a voluntary experiment.  Both of which are overdone.  What I did not expect was that the beginning would be flat, or  the lack of differentiation in the split point of view-at least in the first half  of the book.  Four as we know him did show up, but only in the last half of the story.  The tragic ending added nothing to the story.  This book seemed to be the author's attempt to write a more important story than the one she started with.  Unfortunately, she missed the fact that the factions and loss of choice was already a very important comment on social norms and problems.  Still, if you started the series I recommend you read it.  I wish Ms Roth future success.  I hope she reads the comments and takes whatever is useful from them.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Read this for our book club and although some found the stories to be bleak we all agreed that the writing couldn't be beat and as for discussions, some of us are still talking about the stories long after the book club meeting ended.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Totally Awesome! Get this amazing game! All about horse life you'll love this game! gems buy awesome things just got topaz tack set. competitions get you medals to get a colt.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Really enjoyed the DVD and the message it implies- we are living the hunger games; going to movies today to see the sequel.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game it fun but addictive. I did recommend it to my friend. it works great on my kindle fire.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is very addictive!  I like the strategy involved with each move. I don't like how after playing for awhile, you have to wait 1/2 hour to play again.
B007EC27QM|4.0|What can I say it was free ,it works ....how could it be better than that unless it came with fries.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|If you are a fan of apocalyptic scenarios this is the game for you. You get to orchestrate the demise of the human race through the evolution of bacteria, virus's and fungi. This game is well worth the price and immensely enjoyable without having to buy any of the in-game options.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Vintage Grisham on top of his game... MUST READ. All of the<br />elements of a great legal thriller... You'll be hooked
B008JFUPK8|5.0|It's amazing to separate the reasons why many people have tried to criticize this movie. First there are the comic marvel fans somewhat brainless praising the nonsense in the Iron man, Thor, & Captain America films ( not to almost mention everything but the first 2 X-men & Spiderman 2 ) and hating the Nolan Batman films. Green Lantern sure. But the question is, what would happen if aliens very superior in all ways to us landed on Earth.  We're not talking the weak ones in the Avengers who it seems anyone could beat if you watch the Widow, Hawkeye & Cap to a degree in action. We're talking very powerful beings who in reality only one could destroy the planet. If you accept that then you have one of the most thrilling movies in which one decent powerful man from space battles 3 ( more if the rest had joined in ) crazed equally give or take powerful beings. This isn't the playtime in Superman 2. It turns into everyone on earth needs to die unless they are stopped.  Superman doesn't have the ability to keep destruction or death from happening while in battle with foes who have the same power. Green lantern might be able to place a blanket force field over a area for a while, while getting his brains kicked in.  Without a doubt the best movie based on a comic book character to this point. The only other to debate are the Batman's.  The movie has emotion, in fact it has everything. Points to remember are that the movie explains why everything that happens, happens. Compare the amount of destruction in the Avengers ending to Superman ( could have been a few minutes shorter but extender version early ). You would be glad that you lived in the Superman movie then the Avengers because Superman would have beaten those aliens in not even half the time, while the Avengers would be down to how long will Hulk last after Thor is finished. You will enjoy this movie. You might cry a bit as well.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This sci-fi is fast paced... full of action, suspense, a bit of romance, comedy, but most of all the special effects is mind blowing compared to Star Wars... Technology has come a long way since and this movie proves that..
B00F2362IE|5.0|This game is so cool and  fun to play. I was so glad when I saw it was free :) enjoy.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This movie is very captivating... It can bring back the joy of appreciating well written stories even for an adult... Fabulous...!!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It has a great set of graphics! The missions are challenging, but not too hard. Great guns, but the loading takes too long for a quick mission. Great game!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely love this book. It is the third book to the Hunger Games series and definitely the most action packed. I flew through this book in 2 days not wanting to put it down. To read this you need to have read the first 2 books-Hunger Games and Catching Fire. It is for teens and adults and NOT for children. I love this book so much and I recommend it to any that wants to read it. You will love it!!!
B00594XOZU|1.0|I hate it now because it used to work fine until one day in september it just shut down on me and i couldn't log into my account. Please fix this app. Kik is a really good app.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is a really nice implementation of the game I have wasted hours with on my my desktop. I'm pleased with it.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|Yanni concerts are always a hoot.  They are especially entertaining on a big flat screen with surround sound.  Even the musicians look like they are having a good time.
B00DMKFN34|5.0|Why would I give a movie that left me flat a five-star rating?????<br /><br />Simple, it was the first movie I took my 4-yr old twin sons to see in the theater & THEY LOVED IT......<br />That just may make this my favorite movie of all-time!!!!
0307155102|5.0|This is great teaching tool for young children. I bought this book for my kids when they were little, and now I bought it for the grandkids. It has fewer pages than I remember, but the content is still filled with everyday items.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|love it. best game ever buy it so much fun. great for kids. gt this game now. so much fun.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great game! I have on my, lb Android phone and Amazon Kindle.  I now have my wife addicted to the game too an  We have made it a 0 to make our plague's after each other out of fun.  But seriously, you can play this game several times over and with the different level of difficultydifferent outcome becapuse of your aiding to the approach approach how the countries approach your disease while searching for the cure.
B0031TZASY|5.0|I found the book fascinating, I felt as though as I was in the boat. Great writing. I haven't seen the movie but plan to now.
B00006RAKP|5.0|His songs just keep coming, and all are so good. This will be added to my collection of when I was a teenager listening to my favorite songs. The song today leave a lot to be desired, all seem to me to be a clone of the others. Elton Johns are always different for each other.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|They game is ok. I give it four stars. I think just about anyone can play it. It is. Not a complicated game.
B001EBWIUO|5.0|Bogey at his best - a complex, multi-dimensional, evolving personality; a good guy, tortured by darker forces deep within, leading to self-destruction.<br /><br />Huston is amazing.  Every time I watch this movie, I pick up a little more of the content of his staccato, piontnent verbiage.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Well written, entertaining, holds your attention.  It generally takes a very good story to get a five star rating from me.
B00C1TOTK0|1.0|This posting is not about this truly great film. It is about the incorect information about being a wide screen production. Yes I expected a croped 16x9 version but there was no wide screen at all. The only place I found a wide format was in the scene selection area.
B000FA675C|3.0|The language was difficult to understand; since it was in French.  Good book. Read it, then watched the movie. Book was much more interesting & intense. Movie was a little boring after reading it.
0061950726|5.0|Great story, written very well.  I love learning about history at the same time that I'm reading a good story.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The game is fun..it's a nice way to kill time. The goals aren't very difficult to accomplish but  it takes some time to earn enough money to  complete other tasks.  That's really my only issue with this game.. the graphics are awesome. I think this game will be fun for children as well as adults.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I was really impressed with the ease of which this app installs and prints from the Kindle Fire HD.  Usually it requires some type of additional work to get the two to work together but this app work immediately!  It was so easy and its nice to be able to print right from the Kindle when you want too.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun to play just wish it did not require some Internet connection. Still fun though.  Firesage21@yahoo.com loves it. Cool stuff going on in the game
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Always enjoy the G5 games and this one is definitely no exception. Great graphics and an interesting storyline to keep you engaged throughout the game.
B007ATHNJA|1.0|First of all, I would like to say that my very negative perception of this production does not reflect in any way on signers or orchestra. I bought this DVD because of Jaroussky and Cencic - I love countertenor voices, and these two are just great. It was interesting to hear and see Jaroussky in this role. Certain departure from his innocent, almost angelic looks when he sings sacred works and his most virtuosic arias from castrato repertoire, or a sense of fun and jokes when he sings with Marie-Niicole Lemieux. His Neron was convincingly nasty, so he did manage to get into the character's skin. His singing is never disappointing, and the rest of the cast was great as well. Singers move with a grace, act  and interact in a compelling way.<br /><br />What is really disappointing is the staging itself, and it just brings down the value of the production in its entirety. There were some decorations, and I guess they were somewhat OK. But some of the costumes were ridiculous beyond belief! I am sure that the stage director had his reasons, because some of the costumes are so peculiar, it could not be just an oversight. But the overall impression, at least to, it borders with a bad taste. Having said so, I must say I am coming from a very different experience. When it comes to Baroque opera, my preference as listener and viewer is certainly to experience historically-informed, fully staged production with proper costumes and decorations. I guess I am spoiled by wonderful productions of Opera Atelier (they presented  Coronation... in 2009 at Elgin Theater in Toronto). Too bad there is no recording of it available on you tube, but to me it is a golden standard of historically informed baroque period production.<br /><br />I am still happy to have this DVD- solely because of the singer though, because as as whole, this production is a failure.<br /><br />One more thing, to have some educational value, the DVDs like this should  come with the libretto and some information onhistorical context. As is, the educational value of this DVD is zero.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Lots of realistic fun. Bighorn sheep and other big game. Tells you the shot you took. I hit a lot of lungs.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|Entertaining and as good as the original 007 it's an exciting  story ....it's hard to realize it is based on fact.
B00GUJP9PG|5.0|I am rating this on behalf of my 9-year-old son...this is his review.<br /><br />This is an awesome app! They added so much. They added some different tractors like Case IH and supplies like milk.<br />There's even a tractor trailer for hauling grain. Can't wait for the next one! Awesome app!
B00E9PMMX0|5.0|Luxury presentation and good price. two individual boxes, I bought 3 and 3, all the films for my ten-year son.
B0039NJTLQ|5.0|Wow. AMAZING acting!<br /><br />I don't really watch many movies without having any critical judgment regarding the acting, story, or direction.... something! It's rare for me to have totally rave reviews. That being said...<br /><br />I've always liked the people in this film, especially Natalie Portman, but they really blew my mind in this movie. Wonderful direction, writing and story. It was touching and even the children wowed me with their acting. The whole thing was overwhelming. I watched it twice in the 24 hours, the second time with my mom because I knew she'd like it.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT: (I can't remember the trailer now, because it's been a few months. I don't think I'm going to give away any spoilers, but please take note before reading on, just in case. Thanks)<br /><br />They advertise it as a thriller about jealousy, but it's actually a brutally honest and sad story about veterans and their families. I have no experience with having lost family to war, but this was really about that. Natalie Portman was especially amazing because she didn't overdo the grieving. It would have been so easy for an actress to ham up this role, but she was so subtle, it was very effective and realistic. The relationship between the family members was complex and deep; there was nothing about this movie that I would have thought needed changing.<br /><br />I want to stress that I had watched this movie thinking that it was about a crazy guy who was jealous after being presumed dead, as they show in the trailers. But it is really about the war, family, and pulling through the most tragic of circumstances. It made an enormous statement about the way that our vets are treated when they come home, and the difficulties they face in reaching out for help.
B000002UDG|5.0|This CD I have played over and over because it has the song Ebony and Ivory on it among others. Too many people are so racial against the Blacks. This song says it all by McCartney and Wonder. The other songs are also very superb on here too.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I consider myself a pretty experienced horror movie watcher.  This movie The Conjuring...has got some really intense scary scenes in it.  I watched it by myself, because my husband was too chicken to watch it the night before.  I hope he will watch it because it is a really good movie about Ed and Lorraine Warren.  We loved watching The Warrens on Paranormal State.  I can't tell how much Ed and Lorraine were involved in this movie.  I did see the cameo...nice touch.<br />I think everyone has their own perception about whether or not this was real, but I am inclined to believe it.<br />I had goosebumps throughout this movie...the ghosts jumping and interacting with life is really frightening to me.  I can't wait for my husband to watch it.  I hope I can sit through it again...I think I can I think I can!<br />Good overall movie glad I watched it.  Love the actors in it.  Everything looked realistic and very scary to me!
B0000033J9|5.0|My grandfather was from Kiev, Russia. I have been intrigued by Russian History, but this movie tops them all as far as the suffering that occurred during the Bolshevik Revolution. A tremendous movie with a powerful cast and history behind it.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|Taylor's first CD is timeless. She has such raw talent, and her voice shines in every song on this CD.
B00004YX39|5.0|I like Steely Dan and always have. Gaucho has some very good tunes on it. I also like Aja, Can't Buy A Thrill and Pretzel Logic CD's.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I found this book quite amazing. There was an array of emotions throughout this book from joy to fear to anxiety. It keep me enthralled and I can't wait to continue on in the series.
B00F9040HU|5.0|Some levels are easy, some levels are harder. I can sit and play this game for hours. It is just fun.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|After just losing my Dad to Alzheimer's, her book rang true for the progressing on the symptoms.  Plus, it was an enjoyable read and interplay by the characters.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|I read this as a cautionary tale- of what could happen. How much social media is too much? Where does the balance lie?
B001EC0OPO|5.0|This is a great comedy and also something for the kids older than the age of 11. Well have a nice day.
B00G21YLF6|5.0|I've learned to love Doctor Who despite the occasional times Stephen Moffet twinges or outright breaks the previously set laws of time, and this episode was no exception.  But I loved it none the less, and by the end I was in epic fangirl mode!
B001AKTZO6|5.0|I got this for my dad and this is his favorite cd. Thanks for having what I was looking for.
1892005034|4.0|book in good condition and met my expectations as to content.  met the needs of a class I am attending on this subject
B0060D0IYY|5.0|I love this movie, and this is something this generation should watch this to realize how serious bullying is and how much more today's society should take responsibility.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A better love story than that of Romeo and Juliet. Couldn't put the book down, a quick read. I loved it
B0053O89KG|5.0|How many times can you say drool, wow sexy, funny, mysterious, care so much for the characters, Nathan Filion is fantastic as are those surrounding him, the incredible co-stars that you would love to have as family, there is nothing bad about his show, not even one boring second. Love it all the way!!!
1609613937|5.0|Love the Starch Solution.  I have read it more than once and plan on buying a copy for my parents.  It is all about healthy food and why we should eat starch.  Yeah for Potatoes!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Funny, charming, witty, sexy and then Nicky Heat. Best funny, sexy, appealing, detective/writer investigative team, hard to beat! Wouldn't miss it for the world....
B002MFULQO|5.0|I have seen this movie 4 - 5 times.  The cast was well chosen and the direction by Oliver Stone was superb.  The story is powerful and even today continues to keep me glued to the screen from beginning to end.  This is a look at JFK's assassination through the eyes of Oliver Stone and he tells this alternative look in an extraordinary way.  A five star rating is very deserving.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|First time I watched Supernatural in Season One I was for the first time since the Exorcist, completely terrified. It took a second look to breather easier and to appreciate the fine writing and acting in this formidable series, I buy each one and will continue to do so. Jeffrey Dean Morgan, one of the finest actor I know, played the dad in this show...he also played Deni in Grey's Anatomy, Izzy's very sick love of her life...Why of Why must he always die.Come on creators, create a show with him as a star and don't kill him off...I hated that part.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Fixed Kindle charging problem as soon as I used it....Kindle just wasn't charging properly...thought it might be the battery, but it wasn't. 100% satisfied
B003L77FYS|5.0|explained thoroughly on all seasons, gets better and better and better and funnier.....I bought each season of course I love the show.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|This is a hilarious movie from start to finish. Not for the whole family though. A lot of sexual induendo and partial nudity.
B004V2S4SS|5.0|Loved from the first to the last, a better show for knowing it is in fact based on a true story
B00G32OMF8|5.0|This film completes the 3 story arc Link later started with Before Sunrise. While that film and it's sister, Before Sunset, are shamelessly romantic, Before Midnight more closely resembles most couples experience but,for me,completes the trilogy in a satisfying fashion.
B00012FXAE|5.0|this collection contains an amazing amount of extras along with the directors cut of the movie. it is fantastic to watch.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Great video. Works and most importantly, a doable and realistic program. You get a great workout in 30 minutes a day. Try it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is not a game of skill  but sometimes all you want is some visual valium! It is sooo addictive!
B005PK1G76|5.0|It blends perfectly with my combi stroller. There is a zipper so I can hide my keys and phone. There are mini compartments for the kids' drinks, toys, snacks. I love it. The cost is fairly cheap. I am very happy with my purchase.
B00BL9860K|5.0|Another great DB book!  I have read them all and still love them all too.  A year and a half ago we moved to a different state in Aussieland and I could not take all my millions of books!  But....I kept all the David Baldacci ones!  Keep up the good work David! :)
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Amazing and very suspenseful and full of action. Good addition to the series. Purchased for kindle. Reviewed by Lucy age 12
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book and ending to the trilogy. Great read and recommend<br />You have to read the first two to fully understand every or and subplot
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary is an eye opener that helps us all learn how corrupt is the food industry, and how big business interest like Mon Santo have purchased up our government and politicians. Buy this video and open your eyes,  We are all victims of our ignorance.
0783230370|5.0|Hilariously entertaining - a great movie for anyone that loves Arnold or just the movies of the 90's in general.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I highly recommend this book for everyone.  In fact, I already had.  Thank you Anita!  I just happened to stumble on your book when I was searching books in the public library for another author.  I going to watch Anderson Cooper's show at CNN, this Sunday evening.  Could my reading this book happened just like what Anita said?  Things come to you even thought you did not ask for it.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a great book. I enjoyed it so very very much. I just wanted to read it 70 times. I loved it
0547564651|5.0|This book delivers the research on education to the classroom, school and community in a way that would help parents, teachers and especially administrators teach in ways that lead to a successful life - (with higher scores as a welcome side effect.) Well told stories make the reading interesting as well.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Liked the book. Kept me interested enough to read it sometimes as soon as I woke up. Would recommend this.<br /><br />Nothing really I disliked. There were a few characters so you had to keep them straight in your head.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|THE HOLY GRAIL OF STONER ROCK.<br />THE MUSIC GETS INTO YOUR HEAD .<br />THIS MUSIC WILL REALLY TRIP YOU OUT
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|This, all in all, is a great book. It starts off slow, and takes its sweet time to build the base of the story so that you really know the motivations of the charachters. If you like books that are a slow burn, but pay off in the end this book is for you. If you can't make it through 100 pages of charcuterie building before anything happens, choose some,thing different.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love Facebook. It helps me stay in contact with my family as we are all over the place. I have talked to people that I haven't seen in years. Since we Don't get to talk much on the phone it is a great way to see everyone and keep in touch.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|So u should like this game if you like to race!!! This game also has many levels and vehicles that you can buy with the money you earn. So, hope you like this GAME!!! =)
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This game sucks. I was very sorry I down loaded it. I didn't have it for two days and deleted it. I would not recommend this game to anyone.
B00G4CXHSK|4.0|It is a fun and addictive game what I love to play when I feel like it. Overall good game
B000W178XO|4.0|Typical Johnny Cash... Amazing! With the price of the Amazon mp3, made this record a great find.  Buy it now!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very challenging at times. But enjoy playing as long as I have help. Hard to figure out at times but fun. Lots of fun.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I enjoy this very much, quick and easy. A must have if you want the skins on the game system of your choice.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Get this awesome game. I been waiting for ever and now it's here. It an awesome game<br />You fight against everyone that why it awesome

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I quite honestly was frustrated by the fact that the Amazon application on my Samusung Smart TV that rendered this movie rental shits the bed.  It rendering is not anywhere near the standards for HD that the TV set is capable of delivering.  The sound, too, was dissatisfying over my reasonably high quality TV attached sound system.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I cannot get enough of this game.  This is my of the game apps.  It's very addictive.  Now the adults get to experience the rush the kids experience.  This is the first electronic game I have played and enjoyed since pacman and Mario Bros.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Slam, Bam, thank you madam!... This action film was way too much like a cartoon for my aged tastes...Bang!, Crash!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run is an awesome game. I love the game so much. You should play too!! Get playing, so much fun!
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Wonderful show but Amazon streaming failed miserably on this one.  The show stopped itself so often to reload, I never got to the end. Skip this until/unless they fix the problems!
B00785P2QC|4.0|If you are in to tycoon games, this is definitely for you. This game provides new quality with the supply and demand/goods and services feature. However further on down the line the game begins to pressure you to buy stuff with real $ but if you complete challenges you should be ok....for a little while
093183841X|4.0|THE authoritative guide to wooden cameras. I'd give it 5 stars but it is 7 years out of date. You won't find a more complete guide to camera prices.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Best game I ever played n awesome effects. The game have the rates ever n this may be the only game I play now
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I put this book on my &#34;must read&#34; list for friends.  I have given it as gifts to about 3 of them.  Reading about the back-channel, behind the scenes contributions of ex-presidents to sitting presidents is absolutely breath-taking!  The story of how Truman used Hoover is especially amazing.  I had always had a really negative feeling about Hoover, but here, he rises to the heroic as he worked behind the scenes to help re-build Europe after WWII, and it salvaged his reputation!  The whole book is filled with surprising stories like this so GET IT!
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Fun. Engaging. Good variety of puzzle types and hidden clues. I've played it for about an hour now and have really enjoyed it.<br />The graphics are gorgeous, it's a real pleasure to play a game when the art is so easy on the eye. The music is nice and not distracting.<br />But it's all about the game, and this game is nice. You'll be moving all over the &#34;world&#34; of the game, back and forth finding clues and items to use in other places.<br /><br />This is a good game and I hope the author will continue to develop it adding more pieces to the world. There won't be any real replay value otherwise, but I still give it 5 stars.<br /><br />For the technical stuff. Game runs perfectly well with WiFi turned off, and all scanners report no malware.
B0036EH3WU|4.0|For some reason one of the disks in season three was a bad burn. Ex handed the box for a new one and it still had the same bad disk. Make watching about 3 episodes a living hell and locks up the DVD player. Other that that the box set is awesome.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Interesting game to play, beautiful artwork and relaxing background music.<br />I almost didn't get this app, even when it was the FAOTD, because it looked like one of those labyrinth-type games where you have to tilt the phone or table to keep a rolling ball away from walls. It isn't one of those games, and I'm glad I did get it.<br />This is a game where the ball rolls until it hits a wall or other obstacle and then you can change the direction. You have to roll over some items in the room and avoid others. Some things can be pushed...some things can be broken if you hit them enough times...if there's no wall at the top and you go that way, the ball rolls back in from the bottom (mathematically, it's played on a torus).<br />I love this kind of game. It tells you when you're presented with the board what the perfect number of moves is...so you can either start moving around right away and do the level, or you can sit a while and think about how to get that minimum number of moves.<br /><br />I really enjoy this kind of game, and this one uses amazing graphics and sound, so it's an all-around winner.<br />If you can get this as the FAOTD, get it. Is it worth 99 cents? To me it is...if you like logic/puzzle games, I'm sure it will be to you as well.
B004YMSTRQ|5.0|While I have been a rivet head for years I have not listened to much Icelandic metal and it wasn't until I stumbled upon a friend's posting of the video of &#34;Twilight of the Thunder God&#34; on Facebook that I even heard about Amon Amarth. Needless to say I was duly impressed - enough so that I bought the CD download from Amazon and embraced this band as I have the endless ocean.<br /><br />Twlight of the Thunder God is a track I can put on in whatever mood I am in and instantly I feel a sense of peae. It is as if the band members are telling me a story about the Norwegian Gods to comfort me. That's rare in music that a band can write a song that offers hope & comfort.<br /><br />I have also found that when I'm reading Nordic literature about the history of the Vikings, their Gods or even the Runes, this is appropriate music to play in the background. The music evokes a sense of the past when Viking raiders roamed the seas looking to pillage hamlets & villages and take back slaves to their homeland. Several of my friends who are involved in Asatru have told me they love AA as well and enjoy the way the band takes the Norse myths & legends and turn them into musical stories to immerse yourself in.<br /><br />In all this album is FUN to listen to. I have to say the title track is my favorite but after that I am a fan of the 'Embrace of the Endless Ocean' because they are both heavily melodic and beautiful in composition. There's a subtlety to Amon Amarth that most rivet heads don't get because all they look for is the power & majesty to the music tracks. Since I have discovered AA, I have turned a number of my friends and family onto this band and all of them have thanked me for it. You just cannot find a band whose music is this melodic with grit and bite behind it.<br /><br />If you decide to buy ONE death metal or one Amon Amarth album, make it this one. You will not be sorry you did. It is destined to be a classic in both Viking metal and the Death metal scene. I give this album five out of five stars for the lyrics being intelligible, the songs melodic, the guitar work for being superb and the rhythm section being vibrant and thumping.

B00GT4V5DM|5.0|Malwarebytes proves again why they're the best.<br />Yes, it catches malware...ALL the malware. If this doesn't detect it, it's not on your phone. I've tried other apps, but they don't catch everything.<br />But this goes beyond just a basic malware detector/remover. You get an app manager, remote locker, phone finder...but only if you need them! That's what makes this a 6-star app...it checks, and if you already have a phone locator app on your phone, it doesn't install this one. What a great idea...and it makes you wonder why other companies aren't doing this.<br />You can set up a very detailed security policy and allow or disallow apps to send texts, access the hardware like storage or camera, make phone calls, etc., etc., etc.<br /><br />This is a complete anti-malware suite, and a must-have for everyone.

6305922756|1.0|This movie is amazing. Buying it from Amazon is horrible. I bought this movie and found that the DVD looked like it was copied off a bad version of a VHS tape and then after about an hour stopped working altogether. I ordered a replacement and the DVD wouldn't even load. DEG Sale Company B-V, who manufactured it and sells it directly to Amazon is a scam and they shouldn't be allowed to manufacture anything.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|I purchased the E6 to help boost the volume of my Grados. The sounds come out of these little amp is impressive, at the default setting, it is basically neutral, and does what it does very well. I prefer to use it with the blue EQ setting since it add warmness to my grado and help bring up the bass a little. I was very happy with it up until a few months ago, at first the device stop to hold charge for very long then it stop holding any charge at all. I then just have it permanently plugged into my desktop which was fine but then it just stopped working. Basically lasted almost a year and die, I've been a fan of Fiio since their first outing with the E3 but their build quality has been shoddy, the E11 I purchased at the same time as this E6 also stopped working since the usb port basically fell off because of a crappy solder job and low quality glue. YMMV so buy with precaution.

Her stamp designs are lovely--fresh and delightful. And her projects are useful and attractive.<br /><br />I can't say enough about this book. It's marvelous! I have to admit, my lizard brain is a teensy bit jealous, but my artist heart celebrates a truly beautiful book, beautifully done. Congratulations and best wishes, Geninne!  Your book will easily introduce many, many more people to the joys of carving stamps.

B0037YOMWS|5.0|O.M.G.<br /><br />Long time hp user, long time rpn addict. 15c (water damage) then a 48s (stolen), then a 48g. Now after 17 years about half the keys on the 48g have stopped working reliably. I use a handheld calc at my desk for simple stuff, base conversion, stats, arithmetic, sit back in my chair to figure stuff out.<br /><br />I went searching for a new calc and came across discussions at the hp calculator museum website about the 'wp34s'. The WP34S is an alternate programming of the HP30B. A group of enthusiasts - with the support of hp - has created an alternate programming for this device that transforms it into a simple and excellent scientific/programmers calc. Nice printed vinyl adhesive overlay is available (and needed) for the repurposed buttons, to find the stickers search for \\"WP34S ERIC RECHLIN\\"<br /><br />If I was reviewing the HP30B as sold by HP I'd complain that the instruction book is nicely printed but too short and incomplete, the device itself is thin and light and it feels flimsy. The keys aren't in the same league as the hp calcs of old, but not awful.<br /><br />But none of that matters after you've transformed it into a wp34s. Base control and conversion is excellent, ability to scan left and right to view large integers, fractions have immediate entry with double '.' syntax mode, random number generator, complete bitwise math, unit conversion, matrix math, very complete probability and stats functions, this thing is a very useful tool. I miss the multiline display of the 48 and true RPL but the WP34S is wonderful in every other way. There's simply nothing on the market that competes with it, if you still have any doubt then there is a free IPhone emulator of the WP34S so you can try it out first.

030746363X|2.0|Kind of a joke in many ways...No way on earth the diet works. I tried, my friends tried. Didn't work for any of us. I did however lose 20 lbs of fat and pack on about 8lbs of muscle in 4 months by following a zone/paleo diet and doing CrossFit 3 days a week but not by following any of his theories. Very misleading Mr Ferris.<br /><br />Some of the other advice might work but are you seriously going to endure freezing cold baths in order to lose a few pounds?<br /><br />The swimming advice is good. As an ex olympic level swimmer i can attest to its merits but few will be able to put into practice his advice/coaching without at least 4-5 hours of swimming per week for a few months, not days.<br /><br />Tim Ferris is a great salesman in the snake oil tradition. A total idealist but really a scam artist in the sense that very few of his theories stack up to reality.<br /><br />Book makes a decent paper weight and door-stopper though!

As the adult child of a mother who had this crippling disease later in life, I often wonder if that is my fate.

B003UYUR0G|3.0|Before seeing PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME for the first time, I was already somewhat familiar with the general premise of the story because I had played a couple of video games the movie is based upon. The movie follows prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhall), the adopted son of King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup). In the aftermath of the invasion of an enemy city, Dastan takes a strange dagger filled with sand as spoils of the war and the city’s princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) is captured. Shortly after, Sharaman is murdered and Dastan is framed for the crime by his uncle Nizam (Ben Kengsley). Dastan soon discovers that the sands in dagger allow the user to turn back time for a minute while retaining the knowledge of what happens. Dastan soon discovers his uncle’s plot to kill him. Dastan flees the city with the princess Tamina. Tamina tells Dastan of the dagger’s origins and explains what must happen to it to prevent the destruction of the world.<br /><br />In terms of fantasy-action movies, PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME really isn’t all that bad. The exposition of the dagger is a bit difficult to follow at times, but beyond that the story is a pretty straight-forward fantasy-action movie. There’s lots of action, some lovable characters, and the typical romance. Alfred Molina has a small bit part in the film, but is one of the more memorable characters. Ben Kingsley is always fun to watch and I think he’s even better playing villains and anti-heroes than he is at everymen and heroes. Gemma Arterton is beautiful and does a decent job of bringing a little bit of spark to a role that is basically written as nothing more than eye candy. As Dastan, Gyllenhall does a good job and is fairly entertaining to watch. I’ve never been a Gyllenhall fan, but I actually didn’t mind that he was the hero in this movie.<br /><br />Although it didn’t do very well at the domestic box office, the movie did fairly well worldwide and is currently (as of 11/28/13) the highest grossing movie ever based upon a video game. Overall, although there isn’t a lot that is really memorable about the movie, PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME is a fun flick to watch.  You might not watch it again and again, but you probably won’t regret having watched it the first time.ighest grossing movie ever based upon a video game.

1439152810|4.0|In The Secret Keeper, we are instantly put in the middle of a violent and startling event. As  a family party takes place on a warm summer afternoon, Young Laurel Nicolson has been hiding out and dreaming of the future. Upon returning homeward, she witnesses a scene that will haunt her for years to come and shake up everything she had thought about her mother. Years later, with her mother Dorothy in the final stages of life, Laurel once questions what happened so long ago, the terrible event. Determined to investigate her mother’s past, Laurel seeks not only internal solace for what she saw that day, but also an understanding of who her mother is.<br /><br />Morton’s novel shifts around in time, as narratives jump from the era of the World War 2 blitz in London and time before, moving forward to the present. Sections are devoted to focusing on several of the key character’s stories. In this way, The Secret Keeper uses a sort of fragmented way of eventually putting all pieces of past and present together, snapshots of key events in character’s lives are put into focus. The setting and time is captured so effectively—especially the descriptions of the World War 2 blitz—that it enhances the mood and vibe of various scenes.<br /><br />Morton also explores several themes eloquently: love, family, understanding one’s past, the dangers of keeping secrets. A disconnect often exists between characters’ romantic visions of life and the actual lives they lead. Part of the lesson, though, is that some hopeful and idyllic visions of life aren’t necessarily practical or genuine, or ones that would lead to ultimate happiness. There are many life lessons that Laurel understands along the way.<br /><br />While the book pulled me in during the last half, it felt like the first half dragged. Some scenes were a bit over the top with romance clich&eacute;s—overdone romantic dialogue and scenes. I also thought some of it could have been trimmed down, too much superfluous detail. However, once Laurel starts putting the pieces of the past together, things really get moving.<br /><br />Over all, I enjoyed The Secret Keeper and look forward to reading another one from Kate Morton.tail.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've had this for a few years now. Honestly, I have only been using it for Netflix. And not very often. My challenge has been the wires and components of the television, DVR, DVD, Blue tooth. What goes where has been pretty intimidating for me. Not so for the computerized set-up of things (I hope that makes sense).  So, we've been using it to watch a popular Netflix series these days. I have my husband or son set up the wiring stuff. Then we watch. Well, today, my husband used it to watch videos from his computer. Something I so did not know how to do (he didn't either at the time). He figured it out.  I had two &#34;Eureka&#34; discoveries with it today. First is that plugging the unit into the USB of the television so it is connected all of the time. The second, and I so celebrate my husband teaching me this, is to use it in conjunction with Google Chrome OS. Oh, it was so easy once I understood it! I had a ball streaming all kinds of videos /shows from my computer to the big screen!! It really is terrific.  I've struggled for a long time because I prefer the big screen, but I didn't get that the computer (I'm telling you, the Google Chrome is the ticket) could stream on the television. And it really is simple! I don't want to watch stuff on my computer screen. I want the full monty, LOL!  I KNOW I am going to use this a LOT more now that I better understand how to use it to my advantage. I think I'll be watching a lot less real television and more stuff via Chromecast. I may even get rid of cable (at $230/month). This is well worth the purchase!

B00DJYJPLO|5.0|What can I add to all the existing reviews?<br /><br />The 1 star reviews almost universally complain &#34;TOO MUCH DIALOG&#34;.  The 5 star reviews (often after 15 paragraphs) exclaim &#34;lots of really great dialog&#34;.  I suggest you make your purchase/rent decision on whether you want a video game experience or an in-your-head dialog-based experience.<br /><br />Sociopaths aside, it seems we spend a lifetime trying to pierce those barriers we erect and to really touch and understand those we love.  These three movies are about a pair doing just that with very human success and failure and ebb and flow and joy and despair.  It works for me.<br /><br />PS:  I think the price for the DVD/BR is too high... ;-)

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I give e-squared 5 stars. I couldn't put it down once I picked it up. I have a new optimistic outlook on a lot of things because of her experiments.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|This is one of my favorite all time movies.  It was so appropriate for today's political views.  I really like it for it self really.  The actors and actress were really good!
B000P407K4|5.0|This a must see. I watch it again every few years. It is so full of Cold War values, references, themes, ya gotta watch it to understand the Cold War era. And Peter Sellers is at his prime. He is a true artist and fills multiple roles magnificently. I can't understand how a person can live a full life without having seen this one!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just s good way to relax and unwind. The different levels some are easy and some provide s real challenge.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Writing was strong but a little precious at times for me.  Structure was interesting and added to the enjoyment.  But overall the ugliness and sadness left me a bit cold.  I wish I could have given it 3.5 stars...
0060536942|5.0|Needed the cassettes to replace one my player tore up from the library.  This story is really COOL.  Michael Crichton is an extraordinary writer of science fiction, heavy on the science.  But don't let that scare you from reading or listening to his novels.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|told from tris and tobais' point of veiw. this is a sad book so also keep a box of tissues near. other than that love it
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|re done better story..it tells about the characters in depth. Good actors and action the best Superman yet in years!
B0011Z5IXC|4.0|Good old Led Zeppelin! I got this to replace one I had previously and occasionally enjoy listening to these old tunes that bring back a lot of fun memories. Hope you enjoy it too.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|What???? I hated it...All brawn, no heart.....NOT MY SUPERMAN.......Don't insult me...It insults the concept of Superman. Violent for no reason. Superman would never beat somebody in the face repeatedly. Hollywood just wanted a fast buck. Anyone who loves Superman&#62;&#62;&#62;Don't waste your time &#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;Bad FX....very dark and might as well have been in B & W. If your looking to be uplifted you will never get off the ground.....SPLAT......
B000002KK2|5.0|Bought this after hearing it at a friends home.  Love it! Listen to this frequently as well as several other albums by her.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzel Washington is one of a few actors today who stay devoted to his craft.  He is compelling and convincing in this story of a man at the end of his rope.  The power he projects on-screen is never better than in this one.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|he loves it super interactive. If your toddler loves cars/trucks as much as mine, then this is a must download for sure!
1451666179|5.0|I don't often buy books of the comics I read online, but I'm SO glad I got this one.  It also has a lot of new stuff, of course, but even the stories I'd already seen are really beautiful in this format.  I loved the layout, and the content, naturally, is the hilarity and poignancy I've come to expect from Brosh.
1400052181|5.0|Superb across the board!  A memorable read by any standard.  I would recommend it to anyone from high school age up.  Bravo!!!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book was very funny and had me laughing out loud all the time. Tina Fey has a wicked sense of humor!
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|I like this new effort but can't manage love for it.  It has qualities that I look for in my metal (diverse guitars and effects with occasional smashing breakdowns; tight musicianship; interesting song structures) but it's also missing something and I think that it's that particular quality of a song being able to jam itself into your head so that you hear it over and over, hum it or sing it, even when you're not listening to it.  I suppose that, given time, a song like &#34;Redemption&#34; could do that to me but it hasn't happened yet after six-plus listens.  I've certainly given it a chance.<br /><br />I think that the choruses themselves throughout the album just lack the right punch.  Another issue may be that the individual instruments aren't stressed enough at times; they're mostly all going on at the same time.  But here I am sounding like I'm complaining an awful lot about a release that I do like.  This album rocks, cleanly and smartly, and is filled with interest and tight musicianship.  Listen to the drums on &#34;Vindication&#34; and roll with them.  Todd La Torre is a great vocal replacement for Geoff Tate; he's got great range, a clean delivery, and can imitate Tate quite nicely if he wants to (listen to practically any of the songs to hear this--listen to the way he stresses the ends of his lyrical lines on &#34;A World Without End&#34;) and fans that aren't aware that Tate's not on here might be tempted to think that this is Tate's best vocal performance in a long time!  Elements of songs like &#34;Spore&#34; could place nicely on an album like &#34;Rage To Order&#34; but by and far this album has its feet firmly planted in a modern hard rock/ metal sound.  It's good but it simply doesn't go far enough in fashion away from the current sounds to make its own statement and keep its own distinction.  It's a good jumping off point from Tate's incarnations and if these guys decide to go back toward the progressive metal of &#34;Empire&#34; the results could once again be spectacular.  At least, there's hope anew.<br /><br />[Note: I picked my deluxe edition from another store so I don't know if the Amazon deluxe version includes: sturdy cardboard CD jewelry case; stickers; pins; emblem?  It didn't cost any extra and they were nice touches to the release.  Worth it for the fan to get the deluxe edition if that's what comes with it.]uld once again be spectacular.

B00BSB2AE4|1.0|This author seems to believe that innappropriate, smutty or banal words are hillariously funny, for from the beginning he uses them to describe almost every thought, incident or indecent moment of his life.  That other people don't find it hillarious is beyond his capability to comprehend.  I had only gotten through page one before a feeling of utter disgust filled my mind, but as I gave it a few more chances to find something minimally humorous, I came to the conclusion that was a hopeless quest.  Perhaps it was written by a pre-pubescent teen who hasn't studied the art of good conversation.  I am sorry I bought it, for I found nothing funny.<br /><br />I must give the caveat that I have occasionally used a few of those words in context of a difficult situation (like dropping the Thanksgiving turkey on my toe), so be assured - I am not a prude.  Yet, as this author uses these words, I must make a concerted effort to eradicate my use of them in any situation, for they have nothing to offer to a civilized world.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|A film like oblivion can sometimes remind us that there is beauty even in the austere, even in the ruin.  While I personally like the greens and the blue hues of our planet the stark black and white and brown contrasts of the post-apocalyptic &#34;Oblivion&#34; starring Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, Andrea Riseborough, and a fetching Olga Kurylenko are almost attractively fetishistic in their composition.  I suppose that the heightened tension of all those killer drones that buzz about to kill humans (timely social commentary? or sci-fi coincidence?) exacerbate how the visuals will burn themselves into the viewer's memory.<br /><br />The story of a clone (whoops! spoiler) who doesn't know what he is and learns that he's doing exactly the opposite of what he thought that he was supposed to be doing is carried out well.  That Cruise's Jack Harper character becomes conflicted due to recurring images/ memories of another life is a trope that is put to good effect.  The quiet and building dissolution of his relationship with his partner/ lover/ wife (?) Victoria (a sympathetic in spite of being cold Andrea Riseborough) as he comes into closer contact with his former wife Julia (Olga Kurylenko) plays out in subtle dramatic fashion and surprisingly makes this cold post-apocalypse feel warmer.  Freeman's (always a solid choice to get him into your movie) freedom fighter Beech is really only there to act as the cipher to Cruise's Harper who holds the key to someone's oblivion.<br /><br />A solid sci-fi actioner.  Must have been pretty amazing in 3-D on the big screen but it does translate nicely to our tellies at home.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I really enjoy the way Ken Follett brings historical events to life by using fictional characters to live and love in the genre of times in which the events of our history occurred.  He is a master writer, and I find myself swallowed into the story as if I were there, as a good read should be.<br /><br />There is one strange use of grammar that Follett uses that catches my attention every time, in a negative way.  His use of the word &#34;had&#34; (past perfect tense) is used more often than commas or quotation marks.  Even more curious is his use of &#34;had had&#34;, (past perfect twice over), when a simple &#34;had&#34; would have sufficed.  Better yet would be leaving the &#34;had&#34; out completely to make the sentence present tense, as the story suggests.  If I &#34;had had&#34; better sense to overlook these eccentricities, I would have &#34;had&#34; a more enjoyable read.
B00EUUJID6|4.0|This is a nice Album.  It's a good mix of English and Italian songs. They sing beautifully.  It's a must buy.
B00GTZJLAK|1.0|Just a cars wanna be and terribly falls short.  This was really a stupid movie.  Even the kids I saw it with said it was awful.  Hard to follow.  Characters weird.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this app its great for passing time! and normally I hate city building games but this game is way better than any city building game I've ever played
B00821PCJS|3.0|I wouldn't start the series.  It's very stupid.  You will be disappointed.  You are not given the reasons why and the aliens don't do much.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved Dr. Sleep. As usual, a great story told by the master. I was hooked from the first page and enjoyed every word right to the end. Thank you, Stephen King, for another mesmerizing yarn. What's next?
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I found this too complicated and didn't realise when I bought the game I would have to buy energy. Not as interesting or compelling as other G 5 games.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|This game is super fun but be warned. Do not be lured in by the free coins you receive if you connect to face book, it is a scam it they will require you to collect tickets from friends to advance to different stages. VERY ANNOYING! Don't get me wrong tho, as long as you do not connect to Facebook the game is amazing.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Well-written prose and a page-turner story. One caveat- too much time and too many details on both antique restoration and vomiting.
B009KNPNT6|5.0|Clapton is not only a Rock and Roll artist his music is very easy and relaxing to listen to.You can just sit back and enjoy. A Christmas album would be nice if he has ever recorded one.
B007C7UZIG|1.0|No idea what the point of this app is to be honest.  Just rubbish. I removed it quicker than I downloaded it
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|First, I must start by saying I am not a holy roller, but the author even has me rolling my eyes.<br />I am a third of the way through this book and her mocking and trivialization of the Christian ideas of Jesus and God are getting old and stale.  I get it.  You think religion is outdated and childish.  Does this mockery need to take place page after page -or the entire section you specifically stated was to mock modern views of God- necessary in order to put your experiments into place?<br />  I understand the concept, but her delivery is rather arrogant.  Some of us evidently are too under-developed and unscientific to let go of our childish views of religion having a place in our life.  The author took a path not necessary to get her point across and it results in a rather immature tone.
B005HSL626|5.0|It smells funny. Also it tastes funny. Don't taste it. Oh wait the was a different game.Also I lost my shoe. I found it.
034580709X|5.0|I love reading authors from other countries. This Harry Hole (Hooley) character is such a good one.  The epitomy of the flawed detective. Love the stories and characters. I've read them all. Can't wait for another!
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|Downloaded this game as the FAOTD and I am glad that I did. It was clever and fun and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it. The puzzles were not too easy, nor were they prohibitively difficult. The game was the right level of difficulty for me to remain exciting. One of the problems I had with the game was that it was way too short. I don't think I'm some exceptional point-and-click genius and this game only took me about an hour and a half to complete. I'm glad I didn't pay for that time. Otherwise, I definitely consider it worth the free download.
B0084AZXKK|2.0|I tried to read it years ago in school and couldn't finish it.  Same thing now.  It was free, so try it if you wish.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works as advertised. Great for streaming Netflix videos. I just wish I could use it to watch the movies that are on my computer on the television with it.
B003XYERRM|5.0|'The Sunne in Splendour' is historical fiction at its very best. I loved reading about Edward the IV, Richard III, their queens and the turbulent times in which they lived and ruled. This is definitely a keeper and one I'll reread.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is an excellent game to play and a great way to pass the time. The first thing I downloaded was this game when I got my new phone so I could see what the fuss was all about. So glad I did.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This is a great game and my girls love it. But the prices for a boost in level are outrageous. This is a child's game and prices should be more realistic.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Literally just a fun way to kill time and at the same time strain your brain just right. It's  the soup and salad of  the game world, doesn't seem yo be very exciting yet leaves you fulfilled.
B00GS1DM2S|5.0|Note, this IS the official Funimation release. Some of these reviews are from a bootleg copy and not for the official release. The bootleg is from Malaysia, listed as a DVD, and has a picture of Asuka on the cover. The official release is listed as being from Funimation and has the Funimation logo clear on the cover. The movie itself is a big departure from the original TV series but if you are a fan, I am sure you will still get some enjoyment.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Episodes are very well written and great acting and character development.  Don't start watching unless you have time to be hooked!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I like the web slinging and free roam but it can be re a l frustrating to get around or land on the ground because the web is too sensitive but nice fighting controls  oh and camera doesnt always follow spidey
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I played this for a little and I fall in love with it so fast and it's free if you won't a good free game get this
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|There's really not many options to play with him.  Im glad this one was free but dont get the other ones with tom that cost $. They probably are pretty bad.  READ THE REVIEWS FIRST!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's a simple game with just brake and &aacute;ccelerate. when he crashes he breaks his neck every time. Kinda gruesome but in a cartoony way. you can upgrade your vehicles as you earn coins. You can even ride a motorcycle on ice. You better upgrade a lot though. Can't seem to pass 10000 yet.
B001KQKC0Q|5.0|Nicleback<br />  They are a great band with a long bright future ahead of them. They can be just a great as Metallica if they can go the distance. Metallica is a great example of a Live Heavy band to enjoy over and over again! ♥
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can You Escape is lots of fun.  It is challenging but not frustrating.  They could be a little more challenging as you go up a level.  Please make more levels.
0452273331|5.0|I hope I can write a signifantly different kind of review than many of the others written on the Fountainhead. I had been thinking about writing this review since I started reading the novel. So many are either Rand-haters and Rand worshippers. I am neither but respect the different opinions. I would like to just focus on the book and the period in which it was written. I finally got around to reading this book. In college I started to read it but never finished it. Total strangers would walk up to me wanting to discuss The Fountainhead when they would see me reading it. At the University bookstore 20 years ago, they had a huge stock of the book. Later I spoke with a student reading it for class. She said it was for intro to architecture.<br /><br />I don't want to go over the book in thorough detail as nearly everyone else has already done, and it would take a lot of time. The Fountainhead has a lot of difficult to understand passages, but there is so much elegant prose, and crisply realistic dialogue. At times I became bored with the tedium and difficult stretches. I took a break from the novel for several weeks. But I kept coming back and I could never entirely give up until I had finished this 728 page behemoth of a novel. I loved the story and focus on architectural elements. Yes, it's a soap opera, but a unique one. The characters are fascinating with considerable depth, and there are a lot of them. They weave in and out of the story. Get a post it note and jot some notes when a new character comes along. Wow, can she write. It didn't have this thrown together feel some that some contemporary best selling authors can pull off (I am looking at you DAN BROWN (his latest novel-INFERNO)).<br /><br />It was interesting to consider whether Roark was more of an artist or a businessman. This book is really worth the time. I am not down with all of Rand's philosophy per say, however. There are so many elements in this story to stimulate broad appeal. Many people identify with the difficulties in life of not being understood, and dealing with constant rejection. Rand's characters are always &#34;high society.&#34; People like to imagine life in &#34;high society,&#34; with sex appeal, money, power, unique creative abilities, loyal followers, and fame. Who never thinks of boating in the South Pacific? It's all in the Fountainhead. Many diverse topics are done in such a retro, old school way. So many people are certainly quite hard on Ayn Rand. I think so many forget about the time in which the story was written, and her life experiences. Only a few other reviewers highlight this aspect. Yet, how can it be ignored? I also would be angry, bitter, and a little googly-eyed had I grown up in revolutionary and post revolutionary Russia. I loved reading this book while constantly thinking about how controversial it must have been for its time. I liked so much of the surprisingly colorful and irreverant language and one-liners.  When discussing the newspapers stories published in the &#34;Banner&#34; it said, &#34;Straight up the rectum, no need for digestion.&#34;<br /><br />The language is old-school. Rand has this fixation on the term &#34;bromide,&#34; and not the chemical kind either. I remember how my grandparents talked about the &#34;davenport.&#34; By the way, that's a couch. Some say the characters are not believable. I disagree. Keating is a sychophant. Dominique is an influential journalist with some serious personal issues. Lois Cook is a bestselling author who puts out crap that sells. Catherine Halsey is sweet girl but not the brightest. She is well intentioned but not as good looking as Dominque. Catherine got stood up but was able to move on. However she was corrupted by her uncle Ellsworth, who was a bit of a psychopath. Others brought up Wynand as a William Randolph Hurst character. Everyone has had relationships gone wrong and jobs that didn't work out. People aren't always how they seem. Every industry has professionalorganizations with knowledge keepers, that are elitist and a coterie of industry insiders. The news and entertainment complex manipulates the masses. This is very true in American culture and always has been. It's not like this in other cultures so much. Rand nails it here. All this phenomena exists in the Fountainhead and in real life. Howard Roark, the protagonist, is quite different, a bit of an enigma. Other reviewers can comment on him better than I can. All themes, characters, and situations,  are still relevant today. It's mostly all pretty believable.<br /><br />I know the ending is a bit trite, ridiculous, and somewhat predictable. But again, in the 40's it was probably considered amazing. Also regarding the ending, realize and understand the times. This is not 2013. A new world is coming from the ashes and destruction. In her time all adults remembered WW1, then came the Great Depression, and WW2. Undoubtedly the worst times in contemporary history. The people needed reason for hope, a vision of a brighter tomorrow and a better life, (all in the worst of times and the ongoing deaths of tens of millions of people, being blown up and gassed in gulags and in camps). Rand brilliantly &#34;erected&#34; (another word she loves) this monument of optimism towering into the heavens. So to ridicule the ending... It's the 30's and 40's. I mean really... People.<br /><br />I will give the book 5 stars even though it should be 4 or 3 (for length, difficulty, and tedium, it's a great story but not a huge page turner except for certain sections). I give it 5 stars because it is a period piece, and everyone should read this book to be exposed to the characters, times, and of course the dialogue and sumptious descriptions that goes with her characters and times. Some of her ideas are interesting. Although she is not the greatest philosopher that ever lived as some think, and we can't realistically craft policy on her ideas. But her work is very interesting and she was truly a product of her background and the age she lived in. Her ideas have influenced a lot of people. I think everyone should read the book to make up their own mind, I'm glad I read it.
B00E95ED32|5.0|Excellent Album...The well known first track is followed by a lot of nice other tracks. Actually I enjoyed them all.
B002ZG976U|4.0|If you think (like Homer Simpson) that \\"Showgirls\\" is the film that has it all (sleazy plot, sexy dancing, skimpy costumes, and the backstage of a club on the Strip or a strip club) then \\"Burlesque\\" is the perfect, or almost-perfect sequel. It's not actually a sequel except in the sense it's the spiritual sequel. It's just as trashy. It's just as improbable, but in a way, it has better actors, such as Christina Aguilera in her film debut and Cher, who's great except for one tiny \\"ick\\" factor, which is her sixty-some year old upper lip has been botox'ed into an arctic frozen wasteland. That lip never moves, even when she's dancing her legs off.<br /><br />The plot is the usual ingenue-leaves-rural-Iowa-wants-to-dance-in-a-strip-club. The dancing is not as over-the-top as \\"Showgirls\\" nor are the costumes; this is more intimate--a burlesque club with tighter shots and more Bob Fosse-like dancing that looks slightly dated for 2010 but fits, all the same. All the women are followed by a dark past that threatens the rosy future, and they are rescued by bartenders with hearts of gold. There is ONE scene I really hate: Nikki, best friend of Tess (Cher) is drunk (as usual) but is ready to drive off after a fight with Tess. \\"Nikki! Don't drive...\\" says Tess only it's practically whispered, uh, Nikki, ho hum, don't drive, eh, oh well. And off storms Nikki. She could have grabbed the keys and had a girl fight. It would have worked in the scene and we wouldn't see someone let a sauced goose operate a vehicle endangering everyone else.<br /><br />If you are having a Festival of Bad Burlesque Films for Download\\" (you have to say this like Dan Akroyd \\"Baaaaahd\\" in the Saturday Night Live skit) this should be on the program, along with (of course, \\"Showgirls\\", and maybe \\"Flashdance\\", \\"Dirty Dancing\\" and even \\"Chicago.\\" Not all burlesque but they kinda fit.
B0058SNI58|4.0|The shoe could be comfortable.  As EVERYONE else suggested... 1/2 sizes would be the ticket.  This is the fourth pair of size 7 Crocs I have purchased...some are too big...some are too small...what to do???????  How do ya know????  These need about another 1/8&#34; to 1/4&#34; to be wearable.  8s would be too floppy...DISAPPOINTED...
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A refreshing first hand account of ONE experience of life beyond life, with some extra validation due to the author's status as Scientist and Brain Surgeon.<br /><br />Yes, we know God loves us all since Christ died for all. Jumping to the thought that &#34;nothing we cam do will separate us&#34; seems questionable and likely counterproductive for all. That may have been the message the author needed to hear, but true for ALL? Seems a stretch.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great sequel to 'A Time to Kill' Grisham is a master story teller of southern culture. He captures the era perfectly.
