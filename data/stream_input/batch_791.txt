0761145613|4.0|It can be difficult to find a large calendar for a busy family with four children.  I spend each December at the stores hoping to find the perfect blend of spaces for people with boxes big enough to write out their daily activities.  This year I thought I'd try the Sandra Boynton calendar and am glad I did.  With a space for each day, INCLUDING Saturday and Sunday and columns for four children it has been a perfect fit for us.  So perfect, in fact, that I hope they are planning to do one exactly the same for 2009.  If so, I'll continue to use this until we add another member to the family.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I don't know enough about filmmaking to give a   comprehensive review, so all I can say is that   I'll watch Cranford over and over.  I love it!   I was invested in the characters from the   beginning and was sorry when it ended.    Will the story of Cranford continue?
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|Don't buy this cd! I like the songs, but they put a copyright on it so that you cannot listen to it on the computer or put it on itunes! What's the point? When was the last time you walked around with a walkman? No to mention, this cd won't work in certain cd players. I listened to it once, put it in another cd player (that EVERY OTHER cd has worked in) and it wouldn't play and just spun around and scratched itself so not it's ruined. Biggest waste of money ever.
0575081384|5.0|With already over 300 reviews I wonder if I even need to bother.  It was just so good I think I need to add to the masses.  This book was recommended by a librarian friend and I was very into it from the first page.  Now I look at the reviews and the first one I see is by Robin Hobb.  Impressive.  I am on the edge of my seat till the next one come out.  April can't get here fast enough!!!
B0013D8LCW|5.0|The beginning of this film had me frustrated and angry for Zach. I kept asking myself why allowed himself to be used by his pathetic excuse for a sister. But he was the one in the family with heart and responsibility. Then we meet Shawn. The brother of Gabe who is a good friend of Zach's. The two form a friendship again even after knowing each other for years. The chemistry between them is awesome and the one....only one...(darn) heated love scene, is electrifying. It was a good movie. The only complaint I had was I wanted more good sexy fun between the two men, and less brow beating agony. But I do get the producers were looking for mainstream, and mainstream love to see gay men punish themselves...yawn. Buy it. It was still a feel good film worth the time.
B0018AK9RA|1.0|Joking aside, let me get straight to the core of what's wrong with the 'Metal Gods' latest endeavor.- It's a CONCEPT ALBUM. Now boasting an illustrious career, spanning 4 decades, I suppose Priest has earned the privilege of exploring new avenues to focus their music. The culmination of which is presented to us as an epic concept album about......you guessed it, Nostradamus, the famed prophet. Unfortunately, the only thing 'epic' about this double-disc disaster is it's failure.        Never let it be said that Halford was any great writer of lyrics but in the past they served more as a vessel to guide his sky-shattering vocals, propelled by pounding riffs and powerful solos. All of the staples that made Judas Priest the innovators and kept them at the forefront of Heavy Metal are all but nonexistent here. Rob's voice rarely breaks mid-range. Tipton and Downing's riffs and solos are so generic and bland, I found myself dosing off at times. Thus, we're forced to focus ONLY on the lyrics which are cheesy at best. Not to mention, I can't help but feel that the timing of this album's release is in someway Halford and crew's answer to Iced Earth's recent concept release, 'Something Wicked Part 1: Framing Armageddon' featuring Tim 'the Ripper' Owens on vocals which is infinitely superior in every way.        Overall, 'Nostradamus' is a bloated album filled with synth-orchesta backed intros and outros to a handful of ballads, which in themselves, feel like nothing more than segues to more epic and powerful songs that never come. This feels less like a Judas Priest album and more liken to something Andrew Lloyd Webber crapped out after having grudge sex with Sarah Brightman. I'm as big a fan of Judas Priest as the next person but I cannot, in all good conscience, let that cloud my judgment or defend this album in any way. I found 'Angel Of Retribution' to be a triumphant, if not fitting, return for Rob Halford and can only hope they've learned their lesson and leave theconcept album business to King Diamond.        In short, if you must have your Judas Priest fix, download the title track and never speak of this again.        There, I just saved you $15 and 1 hour and 40 minutes of induced psychosis.
0393324818|5.0|Michael Lewis' Moneyball, is a great introduction to the increasing role statistics play creating a winning baseball team.  Lewis profiles the A's owner, Billy Beane, and shows how Beane has managed to create a winning team despite a small budget.  It begins to put to rest the use of worthless stats, such as RBI, which is really only a measure of how good the batters are in front of you.    As a former baseball coach, I was interested in the chapter on how Beane selects players from the amateur draft.  He creates a strong case for players attending college before entering the draft, especially if one's life long dream is to play for the A's.    If you enjoy Moneyball, I would suggest reading other similar books such as Baseball Between the Numbers, The Fielding Bible, Mind Games, and The Baseball Economist.  In general, anything by the Baseball Prospectus people is a great choice.
B00164DWEA|4.0|Reviewing this \\"Hulk\\" is difficult for me, because I really loved the first movie (the Ang Lee one) a lot.  Nevertheless, there's definitely some entertainment value in this one.    Things I liked:  - The Abomination looks awesome.  Unfortunately, there are a few hiccups leading up to his appearance (more on that below).    - The choice of color for the Hulk is nice.  The CGI guys managed to make him simultaneously green and gray, which not only pays homage to the Hulk comics (he was gray in the first issues, before they switched to green), but also makes him look slightly more believable.    - There are a few funny beats to Bruce & Betty's relationship which I liked.    - The first scene featuring the Hulk is very well done.      Things I don't like:  - The Hulk, in some ways, looks somewhat less believable than the one in the original film.  It's hard to tell in what way he looks less real, but something about him seems off.    - Overall, Ed Norton and Liv Tyler are utterly wasted.    - General Ross is completely unlikeable.  I much prefer the Ross played by Sam Elliott in the first film; at least you could understand his concerns about the Hulk posing a threat to civilians.  Here, Ross is only interested in capturing the Hulk to study for the purpose of weapons development, regardless of any collateral damage along the way.    - The motivations for the characters' actions seem nonexistant at times, particularly in the last moments building up to the appearance of the Abomination and his battle with the Hulk.  In these moments, I definitely felt like the story was driving the characters along, rather than the characters driving the story.    So there you go.  Normally I might give a movie like this 3 stars, but in this case I'll go ahead and give it 4, if only because the battle between the Hulk and the Abomination is pretty cool.
B0012E6R3W|4.0|This is a an excellent example of a \\"true\\" thrash album that reminds me of their earlier releases such as New World Order, Pratice What You Preach and Souls of Black.  I loved these releases back in the eighties and nineties due to Alex Skolnick's guitar work. Well, the band is back and at its zenith with an aggressive and non-stop drum pounding release. any long time fan will appreciate this album especially now tat Alex Skolnick is back and at his best.
B00140PK6O|5.0|Judi Dench is my alltime favorite actress.  Every time I see her in a movie I say this is the best one yet.  Now I say it again.  The cast consists of 25 major british actors.  The script is first class and the sets are as authentic as you can get.  Whoever said that Judi can do more with facial expressions than anyother actor can do with a page of dialog should view this series and see how right he was.  This is classic BBC television at its very best. If you buy this set, make sure that you watch the extras at the end.

My girlfriend is in love with this guy, and she has officially turned me into a fan as well.  It's a must have for any John Mayer fan, and I'm willing to bet you would like it even if you weren't.  Get it. At $9.99 it's a steal, you won't regret it.
B00004XMTJ|4.0|I really enjoy most of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals, but this one didn't really interest me.  As expected the music and choreography were great and the acting was wonderful.  Where Cats seemed to lack was storyline.  After watching the film, I'm not exactly sure what the story was about, other than a bunch of Cats.  I have never seen Cats on stage, but it seemed the DVD captured the stage experience fairly well.  Overall, good job on the music, dance, acting and transfer to DVD.  A more defined plot is what would have pushed this to the next level.

B000RPTQ1C|1.0|I am so mad at myself for buying this CD. I downloaded without listening to it first. It's horrible. It is the most bland, watered down, uber-mainstream and uninspired excuse for music I've heard in a long time. Coldplay has resorted to adding ethnic and Louisiana-styled sounds to their songs - in a feeble attempt to make them interesting. It doesn't work.    I'd rather pull my fingernails out slowly with pliers than listen to this CD. Yes, it's that bad.
6304696515|4.0|Dangerous Liaisons  This movie, to say the least, is very different. It is a period piece from the 1700s and takes place in France. Vicomte de Valmont and Marquise de Mertuil have become obsessed with destroying people's life. They find it entertaining and treat it like a sick game. Vicomte was summoned by Marquise to carry out the deed of deflowering a family member of hers, Cecile de Volanges. Cecile is set to marry Marquise's ex-husband and Marquise wants her revenge for him leaving her. Vicomte refuses to accept such a petty task and claims he is on his own mission. His mission is to corrupt another women named Madame de Tourvel, of course by deflowering her and destroying sense of moral. He will be leaving for his Aunt's home to find her soon. The two make a bet that Vicomte cannot finish his personal mission; if he does then Marquise will sleep with him.    Vicomte is one of the most devious main characters I have ever seen. Every move he makes is cunning and used to rip apart his victims until they fall into his arms. Marquise often helps him in his sinister plots to destroy these women. This is one of my favorite villains of all time, and I am happy that he is the main character.    Marquise eventually makes it able for Vicomte to do both assignments by moving Cecile into Vicomte's Aunt's home. Cecile had desired a young man named Chevalier Danceny, played by Keanu Reeves, and Marquise suggested a move into the country with Vicomte's Aunt. From there Vicomte approaches both tasks in hopes to win over Marquise.    The story is wonderful and it continues to amaze you how evil Vicomte really is. He smiles after every single sick move he makes just to show you how evil he is. Before the end of the movie you will see a different side of him though, a side that cares less about Marquise and more about one of his victims. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for something interesting and new.
0743454537|3.0|The pretense of Picoult's novel is instantly intriguing; a 13 year old, Anna, who exists solely to keep her leukemic sister Kate alive by means of transplants of blood, bone marrow, and whatever else might be needed, since Anna has been genetically engineered to be a match to her sister. However, the novel is disappointing. Picoult tries to draw depth and insight from her mundane characters, constantly taking side trips from the plot to small events in the past that would be otherwise irrelevant, had not it been for the far-fetched connection drawn at the end of each of these passages. The novel's conclusion, however, is exceptionally brilliant, and will leave readers stunned. I only wish I could have sidestepped the many reminiscences of the girls' melodramatic mother and the maddeningly feeble romance between two lawyers to get to it.
B0000AM6K2|4.0|I heard one track from this cd at someone's house, i was sitting on the couch around 7 pm, on a summer day and \\"under your charms\\" was playing, it was the live version,i only briefly heard the lyrics yet i was touched, and under your charms is still one of my favorites on this cd. it is so perfect for summer, i feel Josh Rouse  had lofty ideas for this concept album was able to achieve them , he comes across as thoughtful, playful yet humble.  1972,Under your charms, Rise, James, Love Vibration Comeback, Pretty Boy, the whole album is a treat!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Once again, it would seem that Pixar has created what may be the best movie of the year, in any genre. At the very least, it should rank as the best animated flick of the year. If you haven't seen it yet, rectify that situation immediately, and take your grandmother and grandson with you. I guarantee that you will end up laughing and crying at the same time, and your $10 will have been well spent.<br /><br />First off, this really is a science fiction movie. It does exactly what sf should do: imagine the continuation of some current trends and looks at the results. It starts with the concept that humans have made a real trash-heap out of the Earth, so bad that neither humans nor anything else can live there anymore. What's left of humanity has exited, stage-left, in giant luxury space-ships, to await the time that the clean-up robots they've left behind will have finished cleaning up the place. Wall-E is one such robot, the last one left that's still operational, and his daily work is picking up all the trash laying around, compacting it into cubes, and stacking up the cubes - which by the time this movie opens form skyscrapers. The picture that is painted is a depressing one, not just because we can see just how badly humans have treated their home world, but because we can see just how much is still left to do, with only one little robot there to accomplish the task. Not a standard start for what is in essence a romantic comedy.<br /><br />The comedy of this movie is not forced, nor is it a parody playing on other sf films, as [[ASIN:0783244320 Galaxy Quest]] does. Instead it creates its own environment, and the comedy derives from the bitter-sweet circumstances of a very lonely Wall-E. The only other living thing he has as a companion is a cockroach (which does play on some long-ago statements that such insects would be the last survivors of a world catastrophe). His off-time is spent viewing old romantic movies and collecting and studying various interesting bits of trash, such as a Rubick's cube. Wall-E is beat up, rusty, getting by by scavenging spare parts from other, now non-functional, Wall-Es - a Charlie Chaplin figure down on his luck. So the attraction he feels for Eve, a sleek, modern robot sent back to Earth by what's left of humanity to determine if conditions have improved enough to return, is immediate and very understandable. His clumsiness in trying to show his affection is both touching and truly funny.<br /><br />The plot continues to unfold in true science fiction fashion, as we see what has become of humanity after seven hundred years of floating around in their luxury space-ship, with every need instantly gratified by ubiquitous servant robots. And this is done without long voice-overs (in fact, there is very little real dialog in the entire movie, and it's rather incredible just how much is communicated without all the words), but rather with some very effective visuals that explain instantly how things got to be the way they are today. There's some definite satire lurking behind some of these scenes, pillorying past Presidents, some other movies, and certain very large corporations.<br /><br />Even better, the science is real. There is one sequence where Wall-E jets around in space by using the propulsive action of a fire extinguisher bottle - a sequence that, while not having the majesty of the shuttle docking to a space station of [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001 - A Space Odyssey]], shows the consequences of Newton's third law in an amusing, beautiful, and highly effective manner.<br /><br />It's very rare to find Hollywood script writers who understand what science fiction is all about, and even rarer for them to able to combine such ideas with comedy and romance without making a mess of things. This one does it. If this doesn't take at least the Hugo for best movie, and several Oscars, something is very wrong.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)h as a Rubick's cube.

0930289234|4.0|This comic was recommended to me, but I would never have picked it up myself - it looks like and has the feel of the old superhero comics which I do not like at all (except for The Spirit). But this one is deeper than you might think - it's a serious looking parody on these very supermancomics, which makes it nice. I still don't really go for the looks of this comic, but the story is really good.
0385340567|1.0|I've read all the previous Jack Reacher novels and was looking forward to this one.  Ughh!  What a disappointment.  I never thought I'd say this about a Jack Reacher novel, but \\"Nothing To Lose\\" is really boring.  Normally, Lee Child includes some interesting minutae to show how Reacher's mind works.  But \\"Nothing To Lose\\" was loaded with minutae that was tedious.  The following is a parody, but the book was filled with passages like:  \\"Reacher decided to brush his teeth.  He brushed them twice a day.  Sometimes three times.  They were pretty good teeth.  He'd only had three cavities in his life.  One was filled with gold, two with amalgam.  He pulled the collapsible toothbrush from his pocket.  Except for his money and an expired passport, it was the only item Reacher carried.  It was lavender.  Reacher had been given a choice of pink, blue, white or lavender.  He had chosen lavender.  He unfolded the toothbrush.  It was plastic, with a metal hinge.  The bristles were neither old nor new.  Reacher opened his mouth and began brushing.  He brushed his right rear molars first.  He used an up and down motion, making sure to brush gently along the gum line.  He did not use toothpaste.  Most of the time, toothpaste was not available.  Reacher had used toothpaste from time to time in the past, but didn't think enough of it to fill another of his pockets.\\"  Etc., etc. ad nauseum.

B00004XMV6|5.0|I had always heard about this movie, but had never seen it until recently.  All I can say is Wow! Erotic, passionate, thrilling, sexy. It did not dissapoint my husband and I. I recommend it for adult couples who want to be teased and intrigued. Mickey Rourke is both sexy and scary and fascinating. You do not know what his intentions are, whether he is going to hurt Kim, or Kill her or just make love to her! And Kim Basinger is so adorable, vulnerable, sexy and amazing.  The refrigerator scene is my favorite. I dont recommend you watch this with children under the age of 18. Its too STEAMY!  I recommend Adults add this one to their DVD collection and watch the sparks fly!

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Some encounters bathe your senses with ravishingly new waters that somehow leave you behind relishing a surprisingly familiar taste. Big Fish, for me, was one such encounter.<br /><br />Based on Daniel Wallace's book, \\"Big Fish - A Story of Mythic Proportions\\", this is the story of Will's quest to demystify the tales and the life and the very person of his enigmatic father, Edward Bloom. A wonderful fairy-story in its own right, this is essentially an allegory depicting the complex, sometimes funny and often mysterious relationship between a father and his son.<br /><br />More than the allegorical function, however, what really arrested my attention was the character and portrayal of Edward Bloom. A look at Bloom and you instinctively know that there goes a happy fella, as if playing in his own `garden'. And it gives you a glimpse of how beautiful this world is, and how wonderful it is to be alive.<br /><br />However, it is not the virtue of his `world' per se that gives this flavor to his persona. For his world is in essence little different from ours: a similar blend of things good and evil, of friendship, malice, love, hate, jealousy, escapism, courage, cowardice, honesty, thefts, wars, health and disease...<br /><br />Rather, it is Bloom's sense of life that projects the enchantment onto his actions, his people and his country. A sense of life that wants to grow; that refuses to get stuck in comfort and convention; that exercises courage over caution; that pursues beauty...and the best within itself...<br /><br />A quote that eloquently reveals this sense of life of Bloom: \\"There comes a point where a reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he has made a terrible mistake. The truth is, I was never a reasonable man.\\"<br /><br />Ultimately, all of us aspire to lead good lives, although `good' spells different things for different people. I have aspired to attain a free spirit, have believed in never giving up, have hoped to find magic in little things of daily existence, have nurtured ambition and disregarded convention and have happily been a `fool' (more about Bloom's idea of a `fool' later). I have tried and I yet keep trying. Many times have I failed, not only in my concrete pursuits but also im my attempts to reach this ideal. Many times has the loss brought me to the brink of desperation. But I have found my footing, eventually.<br /><br />Even before watching this film, I vaguely knew of this ideal, but had no visceral image in my mind of how it might turn out to be. Big Fish provided me with that image. In a sense, it was a very satisfying vindication of my unconscious dreams and beliefs. Yet, amazingly, it was a profoundly and refreshingly new experience.<br /><br />And that it continues to be every time I watch it.<br /><br />I'll sign off with another quote of Bloom's that is essentially similar to the previous one, yet has an enchanting quality about it:<br />\\"There's a time where a man needs to fight, and a time when he needs to accept that his destiny is lost, that the ship has sailed, and that only a fool would continue.<br />The truth is, I've always been a fool.\\"disregarded convention and have happily been a `fool' (more about Bloom's idea of a `fool' later).

0452287022|4.0|Tracy Chevalier's  depiction of societal abnormalities(at least in contrast to post-Marxist Soviet Union or post revolutionary France and America) richly delivers a tender story about a tender girl whose portrait has been named the Dutch Mona Lisa.<br /><br />Embellishing stories into modern novels has been a successful and fun twist for many writers - perhaps with Maguire leading the 21st century on such with his wonderful twists to the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" and other classics.  But to embellish upon the unwritten - rather to transform painted art into  written art - makes the embellishment seemingly more complex and more  impressive.  This author looked at a painting and made a story of what happened before, during and after it was painted.<br /><br />The plot has social injustice placed upon the 16-year old shoulders of  Griet, the narrator and protagonist.  Forced into becoming a maid because of her father's misfortune of being near a tile kiln when it exploded, from which he lost his sight and career, Griet's \\"involuntary servitude\\" offers the family its only chance of survival.<br /><br />From there we learn she works for Johannes Vermeer--the famous Dutch painter of today.  Vermeer came from the Dutch school that veered away from painting only religious relics, and focused instead upon persons and nature. \\"Is not painting God's creatures equally valuable?\\" Vermeer asks Griet when she is questioned about her asking him if all Catholics paint only crucifixes and biblical images.<br /><br />But, even though the story is about a girl and an artist's family, the major theme is about social 17th century inequality in Holland. Social inequality of that time is worse than our 21st century minds can think.  Children on Vermeer's house control Griet.  Maria Thins, Vermeer's mother, controls the house. But, money controls them all.  As Vermeer plodded slowly in his painting, the bills piled high and often unpaid. Behind the satin sheets and cloth drapes were the Vermeers who cowtowed to those who paid them, in a manner Griet did of her master in the Vermeer household.<br /><br />Sadness resounds in the book.  Joyful interludes exist, but are rare. Details about daily accounts at the backbreaking daily labours of the maid and others make one only agree how lucky they are not living then, there and in her shoes.  And when we read a few hundred pages of the detailed travails of the teenage maid, we understand why the painting does not include a smile, does not include a twinkle in the eye, and does not include but a tiny hint of her hair color or length.  Instead the eyes show obedience and hidden emotion. The outfit is totally unrevealing, unlike the busty aristocratic portraits. And, by such untold statements of her eyes and mouth and clothing, the portrait - especially after reading this book - tells us so much about the pains and misfortunes experienced by someone so young and otherwise innocent.em, in a manner Griet did of her master in the Vermeer household.

0743277465|5.0|This book presents a very eloquent and rigorous examination of the learning process. Despite a handful of critical reviewers, I find the principles translate very well to other disciplines if you put a little thought into it. The principles are most easily adapted to performance-based disciplines, such as music, dance, any kind of public speaking, and, of course, competitive fields such as sports and chess. However, the principles also apply to any discipline that requires mastery of fundamental skills leading to an ability to use these skills to deal creatively with new problems. Yes, this should include science and language learning. The book doesn't tell you specifically how to learn the fundamentals of any particular discipline. Nor could it--this is something that really requires either the guidance of a teacher or a rigorous process of self-exploration. Rather, Mr. Waitzkin attempts (quite successfully, I think) to drive home the point that progress comes when we slow down the material we are learning to the point that the nuances of the subject open up to us. The secret is to love this process and not get thrown off course by impatience or lack of concentration. Mr. Waitzkin's passionate discussions of his fields do much to illustrate the feeling that you must try to access in your own field. This has apparently gone over the head of some reviewers (who don't appear to have made much of an effort to understand the book), but the number of positive reviews should tell you that there are at least a few profound insights in this book.     Also, a few reviewers complain that this book is only useful for someone with the time and money to spend devoting themselves to their hobbies. It's true, most of us could not afford to spend all our time practicing Tai Chi, as Mr. Waitzkin apparently does. The book does not offer shortcuts. However, if you have a job at which you want to excel, you will certainly have enough time to take advantage of the principles. Further, even if you want to excel at your hobby and only have an hour a week to spend on it, your time will still be better spent practicing slowly and immersing yourself in the details, as Mr. Waitzkin advises. The process will be longer, but if you love what you're doing, that shouldn't matter.
0060254920|5.0|The last line in this great book is \\"...and it was still hot\\", and it is!<br />I first read this book in a Children's Literature class in college (which was taught by our county's wonderful head Children's Librarian); I used it for my picture book presentation. I later over the next few years told it at different events as an \\"oral tradition\\" style presentation, which goes to show you how well it is written. The other thing is the wonderful illustrations.<br /><br />For those of you that aren't familiar with children's lit, the gold medal on the front of the book is the Caldecott Award for Excellence in Picture books. You can hardly go wrong picking up any book so designated and give to a child.<br /><br />I read this to all my kids and now grandkids and they have all loved it,<br />And my sweetheart has taught Kindergarten this whole decade and read this to every class, and they all continue to love it every time!

0446402389|5.0|Ostensibly a murder mystery, this novel is set against the background of Stalin's Soviet Russia, replete with all the ideological ramifications and shibboleths of the Worker's Paradise, where there is no \\"crime\\".  Added to the mystery is a psychological twist worthy of the Freud abhorred by the Communist regime.<br /><br />The protagonist is Leo Demidov, hero of the Patriotic War and now a State Security Officer who serves his country blindly, even to the extent of ignoring the obvious to toe the Party Line.  However, when it becomes patently clear that there is a serial killer committing unspeakable crimes against children, Leo begins to question his superiors' decisions.  He is demoted and sent hundreds of miles away to a \\"nothing\\" position.  He discovers another murder there, and finding the killer becomes an obsession, in the process developing his own integrity, assisted by his wife, Raisa, despite unspeakable obstacles, even fighting against the overwhelming resources of the State.<br /><br />This powerful debut novel has all the earmarks of an accomplished author.  It has already been tapped for a film.  It has a very different plot and is well-written and fast-paced--the reader can hardly put it down so as to find the next development.  The background on life and thought (or lack thereof) in the Soviet Union is telling.  The story is based on a real-life killer.  Very highly recommended.

I learned so much about the Band and each member that was a part of it including John Carobi who took over vocals when Vince Neil quit/or was fired from the Crue.  It's honest & raw and I loved it.  You get a taste of where how it all started and came together. They were so young yet so driven to succeed at what they wanted and they did making some of the best music ever.  GET THE BOOK!!!  You'll love it!!
B0012Q732O|3.0|My lasting impression of `10,000 B.C`. is how good of a movie it really is.  Not great, mind you, but I was impressed at the quality and the quantity of the action scenes.  Never were there wooly mammoth sized pauses or unnecessary delays in the story or action. (Thanks to 'Independence Day' director Roland Emmerich and editor Alexander Berner.) Visually, the action is well framed and expertly shot.  They may have taken liberties with history, but we're not really supposed to care.  Giant ostriches and saber tooth tigers?  Well, I thought man wasn't as well developed by then and animal evolution was far behind, but the movie isn't  pretentious (well, okay, except maybe the title); it's an adventure meant to entertain.  We even reach a well-developed civilization by then, far beyond cave man culture.        The plot is about as simple as the people who fill the screen.  O'Leh (Steven Strait) is the Beowulf of cavemen times.  He must rescue his woman, Evolet (Camilla Belle), and free his people while repairing the reputation of his allegedly cowardly father.  (I guess chivalry didn't start in medieval times after all.)  His companions, like Tic'Tic (Cliff Curtis) provide more conflict and tension to the story, and, in the prehistoric fray are visions and visionaries (like Old Woman) who forecast the future and give advice.  Most warriors rely on signs and wonders rather than on primitive compasses.  Customs bind them all, and a handle on nature is the key to tribal success.      Compared to other cave men movies, this one is ahead by every frame.  Wisely, we mostly get people talking in our own language without all the \\"Ugh's\\" and grunts of past early man movies.  I can't emphasize enough how beautiful the scenes are shot as the tribe whizzes through snowy mountains, endless jungles, and vast deserts.  As dangers come before them, the menace is close to the camera and harrowing to watch.    Don't expect the film to be the next `Jurassic Park' or as intense as '[[ASIN:B000NOKFHQ Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (Widescreen Edition)]]' or '[[ASIN:B000QXDEDG 300 (Full Screen Edition)]],' but if you want a movie that gives you something to look at for nearly two hours and never lets up, '10,000 B.C.' is essential viewing.       (Narrated with the stature of Omar Sharif of all people!  For families this movie is rated PG-13 for the violence and not for any language or steamy love scenes.)
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Shinedown is back and better than ever.  They rebounded nicely after their uneventful sophomore effort \\"Us And Them\\".  \\"The Sound of Madness\\" returns to the band's freshman roots, \\"Leave a Whisper\\".  \\"Sound..\\" is loaded with intensity, high energy and all around great rock vibes.  I could evaluate every song but the reader would get tired of hearing the same adjectives over and over such as \\"great\\", \\"awesome\\", \\"super\\", \\"outstanding\\" \\"very good\\", to name a few.  If one feared that Shinedown lost their touch, they would be sadly mistaken.  This could be the most consistent and one of the best rock album in years.  Whether you're a veteran fan or a new one, you will appreciate this album.  I would highly recommend this album to anyone and everyone.
1400079179|5.0|Dan Brown's second novel The Da Vinci Code has become a literary phenomena, spawning countless books related to the topic, a movie, a myriad of discussions, and so much more. But let's take a look inside this book shall we? The book starts with the murder of the head curator of the museum. Ah but that is just the beginning! The curator was able to leave clues for his daughter, who is a cryptographer herself, follows these clues to France and England, through the past and the present, Through cultured religion and the unorthodox searching for the Knight's Templar and the code the world's masterpieces hold. Dan Brown is a master of suspense and The Da Vinci Codes is just one more notch in this fabled author's cap.

Sadly, I have not really spent a ton of time listening to their third album,  [[ASIN:B000AP2YZE Leaders of the Free World]]--and of the first three albums received critical acclaim but little commercial movement.  \\"Leaders of the Free World\\" will be my next purchase after listening to this most recent recording.  I am digging into listen more intently!<br /><br />My own listening involves a lot of random and mixed artist play from recent and older play lists. I tend to buy a bunch of music --drop it on my player and let the experience sort itself out in a random mode.  When I stop and wonder and look to see what I am listening to, that is a sign it is staying for a while.  The most current Elbow was causing this reaction of pausing, and thinking.. what is this?  It sounds great!<br /><br />When I hear Elbow, new or older, I am always thinking... is this newer David Bowie or Peter Gabriel?  Or more Dave Matthews?  You see, the voicing is somewhat similar to me.  There are even some similarities to older Genesis without all the lyrical trappings that those early pioneers of art rock tended to engender.  Keyboard rhythms and some classically oriented string instruments tend to make me think in that direction.  In the emo realm, another version of Coldplay?  Radiohead?<br /><br />You can tell I like comparing styles--RIYL \\"Recommended If You Like\\" is one of my primary ways to find new music to purchase.  If you close your eyes, and listen, removing yourself from who you think you are listening to --a number of possible comparisons can be made, and to me, it is a bit amazing that Elbow does not garner more of a US following with each new album.<br /><br />Production standards are high on this album as with the other mentioned albums.  Guy Garvey writes most of the words, the band writes the music.  Guy does most of the singing, along with guitar work.  Mark Potter on guitar and backing vocals, Craig Potter on keyboards and backing vocals, Pete Turner on bass guitar, and drumming from Richard Jupp.<br /><br />For Elbow fans, this album should be familiar territory and is recommended.

0743298039|3.0|A very fun read with colorful characters and mysterious plot - a great page turner for the first 90% of the book... and then I just felt as if the author grew tired of the mystery / suspense and just handed the ending to you on a fast food tray. I stayed up until one in the morning anxious and excited to finish the book and solve the mystery, but when I turned the last page I felt cheated. It just fell flat for me at the end.
B0013FXWX8|4.0|Po the panda (Black) wants to be a martial arts expert.  Unfortunately for him, he is working for his father (Hong) making noodle soup.  One day, at the nearby temple, Master Oogway (Kim) has a vision that the evil Tia Lung (McShane) will escape from prison and wreak havoc.  Now Oogway must determine who will be the Dragon Warrior, and defeat Tia Lung.  The five contenders are: Monkey (Chan), Tigress (Jolie), Viper (Liu), Crand (Cross), and Mantis (Rogen), all apprentices of Master Shifu (Hoffman).  Somehow, all of them are overlooked and Po is chosen.  Now, Po must find it within himself to save the village, as Tia Lung has just escaped.<br /><br />\\"Kung Fu Panda\\" is an entertaining, action packed film.  The voice talents are all well chosen, especially Jack Black as the titular panda.  The humor works, and adults and children will enjoy this film.  The animation, while good, is about what one has come to expect in animated films.  The animation bar is high, and \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" makes it over, but does not blow it away.  \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" is a good family movie, and I recommend it.
0312379293|5.0|Jeffrey Archer said he hoped to write a book better than his first and he succeeded here.  As he said in his interview at the end of the audio version of A Prisoner of Birth, in a story of revenge a person has to have a \\"pot of gold\\" in order to have the time to spend on a game of revenge.  And he wanted to find a very creative way to get Danny out of jail.  He was successful on all counts.  I'm not sure I believed the prison sections, although Archer insists the content here is based on his personal experience in jail.  However, going to jail for perjury and going to jail for murder would put offenders in different cell blocks with different rules, so I think there is not as much of a reality base in those sequences as Archer thinks there is.  Nevertheless, he successfully suspends a reader's belief system and weaves a great tale.  The end is perfect.  He doesn't rush it, which many authors tend to do.  Yet he doesn't diminish it with a lot of detail.  It's a surprise, yet he foreshadows it very early on in the book.  The subtly of the foreshadowing is so good that the reader totally forgets about it.  Awesome writing technique.  It's one of the best endings to a well crafted story that I've read in a long time.  The other reviewers on this book give endless story briefs, so I won't do so myself.  But buy it.  If you prefer audio, the reader is outstanding.  I sat in my garage on many a night coming home from work to see what happened next.  Either purchase is well worth your money.
0553381687|5.0|Wow... almost 1,500 reviews.<br />What could I possibly add to what has already been said?<br />George R. R. Martin is at the absolute top of his game with his 'Song of Fire and Ice' series. The first installment, A Game of Thrones is unlike any other fantasy I've read in the last thirty years. It feels real.<br />Due mostly to the fact that Mr. Martin is the king of 'Point of View'. Every chapter is entitled with a character's name who is featured exclusively. The POV never wavers from that character's perspective.<br />You get to explore this iconic realm through the eyes of frustrated children, lecherous war-mongers, idealistic martyrs and some of the most seriously debased villians ever written.<br />Powerfully suspenseful and filled with endless surprises, this swords and scorcery thriller kept me rivited from the first page.<br />Any fan of Tolkien should feel right at home here.<br />I've recommended this book to more people then I can recall and have never received anything less than the most glowing of feedbacks.<br />Some of my friends, who abhor fantasy, took this series to heart.<br />You will not be disappointed.
B0018OAPAW|5.0|The only beef I have with this album is how long it took to finally get here.  Like most Offspring listeners, I've been on board since day one.  With most of their older albums, I can easily listen from the beginning to the end.  This album follows suit, bringing some new stuff to the table.      Highly recommended to anyone wishing to expand their Offspring collection.
0765340798|5.0|I just finished this book last night, and I feel that it is the best of the Dune history trilogy (Butlerian Jihad, Machine Crusade, Battle of Corrin).  All the loose ends in the trilogy are brought together in ways that the long time fan will immediately recognize.  We see the origins of the feud between the Atreides and Harkonnen.  We see the beginnings of the Bene Gesserit, the Spacing Guild navigators, the Fremen.  I felt that this book was very good and an excellent conclusion to this trilogy and a nice segue into House Atreides.  5 stars.

I found the miniseries attention to detail quite pleasing! Tom Hanks and crew hit a home run! Does the miniseries follow the book page for page? No, there are minor changes here and there. But overall I would recommend this dvd without hesitation. It would be great if HBO would produce other miniseries such as John Quincy Adams, Lewis and Clark, or Ben Franklin. By the way, you will be pulling out your dollar bills and comparing that portrait with David Morse'George Washington from the movie!

B000H5V8DG|1.0|I read several reviews here that warned me that this boxed set has a known quality control problems.  I decided to take a chance, but shouldn't have.  The disks come in a hard cardboard folio.  Per the warning, I inspected the disks carefully.  Every disk had small scratches and smudges.  It looked like they had been packed by someone who had just eaten fried chicken.  They were new, but looked used.  Two of the disks has major scratches.  It would take me several months to view all the 29 disks, so I couldn't take a chance and had to return them to Amazon.  I immediately ordered the regular 1st season package and recommend you buy in that format too.

B000UR366S|1.0|The one good thing I can say about this CD is that it retails for 18.99 and I only paid 9.99. I wish I could give it a half star for that. This is a far cry from the brilliant songwriter of the past three decades. Sad.  If they printed lyrics on CDs, I would have dropped this one back in the bargain bin where it belongs. The lyrics read like a page from the radical left's playbook. We humans are a \\"blight\\" on the earth and men are evil because, you know...\\"Men love war.\\" Can you imagine her sitting in her VERY expensive home, looking out on the very beautiful view and writing this? Simply awful. At least she didn't title the disc \\"...and Bush sucks!\\"

0385340567|1.0|I was eagerly anticipating my Reacher fix for the summer. Unfortunately, when I read the most recent novel from Lee Child, it turned out to be Redacted redux.  I don't read Reacher novels for fine fiction, I read them for enjoyment.  Sad to say, there was little enjoyment in this book and much liberal posturing.  Lee child is an englishman, living in homogeneous liberal New York.  Perhaps he thought he wouldn't get a decent table unless he came out with the obligatory anti-war novel in an election year.  I hope Lee realizes that his readers pay him to write good, enjoyable novels.  I didn't get my money's worth this time.  Hopefully, Lee will remember who he is working for in his next novel.
B00177Y9ZC|4.0|I gave this movie an extra star because it is set in Ann Arbor (where I live) and has some footage of Huron High School and the Gallup Park around the Huron River.  Yeah, I know it is cheap of me, but I like seeing my home town on the screen.<br /><br />The movie is about David Rice and his ability to teleport (jump) to anywhere in the world (but not through time).  He first becomes of this ability when, as a teenager, he falls through some ice on the river and is carried downstream with no way out through the ice.  As he learns to master this ability he engages of a variety of activities that stem from his troubled personality.  Max Thieriot does a terrific job as the bullied teenager and Hayden Christensen carries the movie as you young adult version of David.<br /><br />Unfortunately for David, he isn't the only jumper and there is an organization of crazed folks who deem themselves authorized to find and kill any jumper they find.  They have all kinds of high tech tools to locate, contain, and a low tech knife to gut them.  These folks call themselves Paladins.  They have, according to the story, existed as long as there have been jumpers, but I wonder how they contained them without their gadgets?<br /><br />For me, the handling of the Paladins is a real weakness in the movie.  We don't know their true motivation, their financing, or why they are so devoted to what they do.  They are just there and are just the enemy of jumpers.  Not really enough.  However, Samuel L. Jackson does a fine job Roland, the head Paladin.<br /><br />The other problem with the story is that David is not a sympathetic character.  Of course, Hayden Christensen has already played one of those and handles this quite well.  I just didn't feel there was anyone in the movie to cheer for.  We side with David because the story tells us to, but we don't really like him or identify with him.  David's love object, Millie (because he really doesn't know her as a person, just as an idea he projected from himself - as most teenagers do) is the nicest person in the film, but never gets to become a full person here.<br /><br />The film has made more than $200 million dollars worldwide so we will probably get a sequel of some kind.  I hope they flesh out the people rather than leaving them as two-dimensional figures.  But maybe that is enough for their target audience.<br /><br />The movie takes us to lots of cities all over the world and that is a part of the fun.  But most of the time I wondered why the jumps went so far afield.  I know that some of it was an emotional response to a situation, but sometimes the jump could have been down the block for a similar effect to the problem at hand.

B0018TLRTU|5.0|From the minute I heard Billy Idol sing Rebel Yell back in 1984 I was hooked.....and I've never looked back!<br /><br />This new compilation of hits is especially fantastic because it includes a DVD of his greatest music videos.  This man was born to be in front of the camera and he used his looks to his full advantage back in the heyday of MTV.<br /><br />Another reason to purchase this CD/DVD set is because of the two great new Idol songs:  \\"John Wayne\\" and \\"New Future Weapon\\".  \\"John Wayne\\" especially has the sound to be a hit today.

B000002L5P|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing the Smith's in 1984, shortly after their self titled debut.  Still being a teen, I didn't fully appreciate this record.  At the time, my favorite bands tended to be from more popular sounds - primarily the last throngs of new wave such as the Missing Persons, X, Police, Oingo Boing, etc.  While I enjoyed the record, I didn't grasp its brillance & simplicity. This record was so different in its day, there was really nothing like it.      Furthermore, I didn't fathom their show as being the pinnacle, despite attending many concerts & festivals on two continents during that period, searching for the latest and greatest alternative music.  I challenge you to name more than a handful of bands who was making better altnerative music than the Smiths during the 80's.        This record is a must for serious alternative music fans.  In my opinion, its the best Smith's record by a long shot.  It is also one of the cornerstones for the foundation of the modern alternative movement.  As I listen to this record now, it sounds even more honest and genuine than it did 20 years ago.   It took a lot of guts to release this album, as it was so different for its time, so intraspective.  I've owned other Smith albums, but the others come across as so much more commercial.  I suppose the uncompromising nature of this record is what amazes me.
0143038419|1.0|OMG .. what self-absorbed drivel. I am amazed at women who are impressed by this vapid piece of work. The author is a shallow harpy with whom I couldn't have less in common. I can't relate to any of her stupid observations or solipsistic epiphanies. I don't begrudge her not wanting children. It's probably best that women like this don't procreate. It was a massive waste of time to spend MY TIME with a woman whose world ends at the tip of her own nose. What a bore. Don't be fooled into thinking this is even a mildly well-written or amusing piece. It is a text book study in what's wrong with many so-called \\"sophisticated urbanites\\" today.

2266083082|5.0|When I decided to read Les Misérables I was pursuing two objectives: to read a classic novel and to practice and improve my knowledge of the French language. Knowing how long the novel was, both goals seemed  difficult to attain. I am happy to say that I was able to accomplish both.   Les Misérables is a fascinating novel in which the author denounces the French society of the 19th century. It tells the story of Jean Valjean, who after 19 years in prison is released only to realize that there is no place in society for a man like him. Reading the story, your learn about the marginal life ex prisoners have to live in a society that forces them to carry a document (a yellow passport) that they have to show all the time in order to function in society; the horrible situation unmarried women are placed in when society punishes them for having children out of wedlock; the situation of the  the elderly; and also of  abandoned children ...   Hugo also intercalates the main story with long passages of reflections about different subjects such as the history of the \\"argot\\", Waterloo, a description of the underground sewer system in Paris, that although they can be challenging for the reader because of their length, they enrich and complete  the story.  Les Misérables is not an easy book to read. In order to fully comprehend this story, it is necessary to have some knowledge of the historic events that took place during those years.   The third volume of the Pocket Classiques edition has a listing, in the back of the book, under Les Clés De L'Oeuvre, of the historic events that happened in France since 1723 until 1852, that are paralleled to the events of the story. This feature and a Larousse Encyclopedic Dictionary were very useful to me to identify the events as well as the historic characters that are named in the book.   Even though the vocabulary is not easy, with the aid of a dictionary, I was able to comprehend and enjoy the totality of the text. Due to Hugo's style, long paragraphs in which sentences are connected to each other to no end, to reflect the flow of the writer's thoughts, and the difficulty of the  vocabulary,  I would not recommend this reading to a French beginner or even an intermediate level.   I laughed, I cried , I worried about the characters ... I spent hours reading the story without being able to put the book down. After finishing, Jean Valjean, Cossette, Fantine, Marius, Gavroche, Javert  were in my mind and in my heart for a long time. I feel that Les Misérable enriched my life.
B000BM6AVA|1.0|Compressed to **** with the volume jacked. Typical of loudness war merchandise, but taken to a new level. Possibly worse than even Californication. Exhausting and unlistenable.    Just got into an argument this weekend about clipping in commercial releases, so i had to give this cd another listen. I hadn't listened to it since it first came out and it bothered me so much that i probably listened to it 10 times or less. I love System and listened to all of their other albums obsessively, but I could not get into Hypnotize (and not because of the music itself). Anyway, this cd was just as bad as I remembered it.    It was a struggle to choose 1 or 2 stars, but i had to go with 1 since i i feel that even if the music is worth more than 1 star, the point is moot since you cannot listen to it. No one should pay money for this, since that will just encourage the industry's race to the bottom.    Now i'm afraid to buy any newly remastered albums because it takes too much research to find out if it's a legit remaster or (more likely) some hack job where the original album was just compressed and volume boosted.    Since Mezmerize and Hypnotize are like a double album, this is really making me question how i didn't have this strong of a reaction to Mezmerize. Now that i am more sensitive to these things though, i think that if i go back and listen to Mezmerize again, it might ruin the album for me. I will just have to let my time enjoying that album be a pleasant memory and never listen to it again.    Isn't anyone embarrassed?

B000H30B2C|5.0|I went to see this movie four times, during its theater run and everytime I was satisfied with what was shown before me. The cast is great, the special effects are the best of any movie I've seen, and it has a great story.    This reincarnation of the 1933 classic is truelly spectacular in many ways. Naomi Watts is the perfect choice for the Ann Darrow character, and Jack Black makes a acceptable Carl Denham. Adrien Brody character I don't care for at all. The true characters of the film are the fifty foot tall gigantic gorilla Kong and Miss Ann Darrow.    I always cheer for the powerful King Kong. From his violent battle with the three V-Rex, to his final tragic battle atop the Empire State Building, to his final moments with Ann atop the gigantic building. I love the character of King Kong and I always will.     This film pays great tribute to the 1933 classic and gives a great, and entertaining show! I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a truelly great film with tons of action, drama, and a giant gorilla. The best film of 2005! No question about it! Kong is King!!!    Buy this movie and enjoy it!! It's worth the price and the entertainment!!! :)
B000063JZQ|5.0|I love MacBeth, and I particularly love Polanski's MacBeth.  It is difficult to find at video rental outlets, however, so I want it for myself and for students.  My high school students in the past enjoyed this version of MacBeth and occasionally squealed with excitement. One warning: If you show this to young people in school, you may have to skip over the nudity in a couple of places.  It is not pornographic at all, but some parents could disapprove. Polanski takes advantage of what film can do, so his Shakespeare comes alive and does not appear stilted.  Shakespeare himself would have loved film, I suspect, and would have appreciated what Polanski did with his work.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|It truly is one the best shows on tv especially for the summer. It is authenic with its historical references and the writing is smart and funny.The cast provides wonderful performances and has introduced some new faces to the world. I really love this show, its the one thing that can stop me and my sisters from fighting lol! We are all college students and this show stopped us from going out on thursday nights! I really cant stress how good this show is, I tell all my friends to watch it and now they are hooked, thanx AMC!!!

B0018TLRTU|5.0|Can you ever really have enough Billy Idol? Seriously...  At long last, a career-spanning audio visual delight in one handy package. Not a moment too soon, because my \\"Vital Idol\\" VHS tape from 198-ahem! is getting quite worn out, and of course is an incomplete collection. And because Billy really, truly loves us, he's given us two fantastic new songs: \\"John Wayne\\" and \\"New Future Weapon\\". As he proved on 2005's \\"Devil's Playground\\", Billy is back and better than ever.   The soundtrack of an era. Timeless musical gems. As rockin' today as when they were written. Hands down, bloody great songs. This is all true. As for the videos, they are incredibly enthralling short films - of course we'd expect nothing less from the original superstar of MTV's golden age. Watching the videos again in chronological order sent chills up and down my spine.  Speaking of golden age, is it really possible that our beloved Billy turns 53 this year? He remains as impossibly beautiful as ever and his live show must be seen to be believed. Billy puts artists half his age to shame. He sounds incredible and is, as always, the consummate performer. I've seen every tour since 1987 and continue to be blown away. (He's on tour now!)  Buy this collection and get reacquainted or introduced...either way, you'll be instantly hooked and shouting (wait for it...) MORE! MORE! MORE!

B000VNMMR0|3.0|Was it really necessary to make this movie? I mean, you could've just rented, bought or re-watch the very first one because \\"Live Free\\" is a rehash of \\"Die Hard\\" down to the elevator shaft and the bad guys with foreign accents.  Bruce Willis has sort of attained a super natural hero stamina and strength, sure he moans and groans when being pummelled but that's just for sound effects.  Ironically he is what's impressive in this movie because he is aging well. You can obviously tell that he's an older gentleman but still gritty, handsome and he never lost that charming sneer in his smile. Sure the movie effects are visually stunning, the plot is so- so but, the bad guy wasn't bad enough.  I think I am being generous by giving it three stars, it all goes to Bruce Willis.  I recommend you watch the first one if you haven't seen it in a while or if you haven't seen \\"Die Hard\\" at all.

1573226521|3.0|I bought this to read while in Thailand. I was staying on the beach in Chawaeng, thinking this'd be a great read. The best I can say is that it's an ok holiday read. It seems to take itself a little too seriously - like it's trying to become great literature, but needs just a little more. The dramatic point comes a little too late and is too obvious in coming - so the tension doesn't build as it should. Also, it seems like there was a storyline that got dropped entirely - there was a whole bunch of foreshadowing, but nothing ever came of it. I guess this might have been the authors attempt at a \\"twist\\", but it came off feeling more like \\"oops, forgot that one\\" :(<br /><br />Ah well - it's still worth reading once and provided an interesting fictional context to where I was staying. I never got out to the lagoon cos it was raining and high swell - yep, it exists and yep, you can go there on the tour.<br /><br />Maybe next time will be better. ;)
B000ZN802W|5.0|Into the Wild has been in my friend's DVD player for about a month. She has been watching it constantly. I finally got a chance to see for myself, and found it to be a fascinating and compelling story, based on a real person, who may have been tilting at windmills like Don Quixote in his quest for freedom and survival in the extremes of wild nature, but nevertheless, touched the lives of all he encountered along the way.<br /><br />Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) has just graduated from college, with excellent grades, but instead of either graduate school or a career, he chooses instead to go into the wild. He donates his trust fund to charity, burns his money, and abandons his car. He renames himself Alexander Supertramp, and begins his quest to live up to his new name. His parents, Walt and Billie McCandless (Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt) are bewildered and hire an investigator to find him, but to no avail. His sister Carine, who also serves as an additional narrator, is hurt that he doesn't call her, either. But she offers insight into what may have driven him off, comparing him to fine crystal that nevertheless is fragile and needs protection.<br /><br />Along the way he meets hippies Rainey & Jan Burres (Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener). Later, he works on a farm for Wayne Westerberg (Vince Vaughn). He also befriends lonely leather engraver Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook). He kayaks all the way to Mexico and back, rides the rails, visits Slab City in the desert, works in a fast food restaurant, always working towards his goal of surviving a harsh winter in the wilds of Alaska. He reaches Alaska and makes his final stand in an abandoned bus...<br /><br />Into the Wild was directed by Sean Penn. Great job, Sean. He waited 10 years to make the film, making sure that he had the approval and support of the McCandless family. Everything was filmed on location, and Sean Penn takes full advantage with excellent cinematography. Some of the cast were the actual people from the real life story, such as Jim Gallien, who gives the wanderer boots as he goes into the wild. Brian Deirker was originally hired as a technical consultant for the river rafting, but at Emile Hirsch's suggestion, cast in the role of hippie motorhomer Rainey.<br /><br />It features music composed and performed by Eddie Vedder. When Sean Penn called and asked him to do it, he agreed on the spot. I am not a fan of Pearl Jam, mainly because of Vedder's voice, which sounds phoney and cartoonish. But he has really matured, and there is just a touch of the cartoonishness in his voice to give it a bit of character and identity. The music is excellent, great acoustic guitar and the singing surprisingly good, it really adds to the film experience. Vedder does the bulk of the music, but there are also a few songs by Kaki King, some others, and of course we get to hear Roger Miller's \\"King of the Road,\\" which is paraphrased and quoted in the final manifesto.<br /><br />Besides the music, there are also quotes from literature on title cards between scenes, such as:<br /><br />There is a pleasure in the pathless woods<br />(from Childe Harold, Canto iv, Verse 178)<br /><br />There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,<br />There is a rapture on the lonely shore,<br />There is society, where none intrudes,<br />By the deep sea, and music in its roar:<br />I love not man the less, but Nature more,<br /><br />  -- Lord Byron, (George Gordon)<br /><br />The cast was all really good, with the well known actors and unknowns alike seeming totally authentic. I especially liked Vince Vaughn as someone who both mocks and admires the young man's ambitions. \\"Can't be juggling blood and fire all the time!\\"<br /><br />Also there is a great encounter with Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook). The lonely old man looks askance at Supertramp's vagabond lifestyle, but considers his challenge to get out of his workshop and see the world. The encounter offers director Sean Penn a great chance for his protagonist to illustrate his saga by carving his story onto a leather belt:<br /><br />Ron Franz: What does the \\"N\\" stand for?<br />Christopher McCandless: North.<br />Ron Franz: [sounding surprised and frustrated] Alaska?<br /><br />Once he reaches Alaska, he continues carving out his story on a board he finds in the 'Magic Bus.'<br /><br />Christopher McCandless: Two years he walks the earth. No phone, no pool, no pets, no cigarettes. Ultimate freedom. An extremist. An aesthetic voyager whose home is the road. Escaped from Atlanta. Thou shalt not return, 'cause \\"the West is the best.\\" And now after two rambling years comes the final and greatest adventure. The climactic battle to kill the false being within and victoriously conclude the spiritual pilgrimage. Ten days and nights of freight trains and hitchhiking bring him to the Great White North. No longer to be poisoned by civilization he flees, and walks alone upon the land to become lost in the wild. - Alexander Supertramp May 1992<br /><br />10 movies that pertain to Into the Wild<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000NO39FG Alpha Dog (Widescreen Edition)]] (2006) ....

B0010YSD7M|3.0|I'm a great SG-1 fan and have everything from the Role-playing game to all ten seasons.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the Ark of Truth.  There was nothing new.  Nothing even creative.  The worst part for me was bringing back the Replicators.  These creatures were already beat to death and here they served only as a means to give SG-1 something to blow up.<br /><br />The main characters had virtually nothing to do in the movie.  Sam spent her time blowing stuff up.  Tilk, nothing but looking tough.  Daniel, Vala...bit parts while special affects and the ancients saved the day.  As a collector of SG-1 stuff I had to purchase it.  As a movie...well, it's a pretty lame attempt to recreate the glory times of the series.

0385340567|1.0|My husband and I have read each of the Reacher novels and enjoyed their colorful, willful and determined main character. A man of honor and principle, Reacher has not always followed the rules, but is always for justice. Not in this book!    He is a slovenly drifter who mouths anti-American, anti-government (US), anti-military, anti-Iraq war rhetoric of the author. What a disgrace.    Sorry, Lee Child. We just bought your last book and will not make that mistake again. How did you turn into such a negative, depressed person? What a shame!
B00006AW2G|5.0|If you're wondering which CD of this Stones classic to get, get this one. The digitalized remastering process here sounds almost as good as pristine heavyweight vinyl. And for younger listeners, if you've never heard \\"Let It Bleed\\", you're in for a ride. From the first quiet haunting notes of \\"Gimme Shelter\\" to the tongue in cheek choral intro and outro of \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" - with plenty of hard rockin' in between - it's the Stones at one of their all-time peaks.

B000065PUE|5.0|I was born in the early 80's, and became a fan of alternative rock in the early to mid 90's when grunge was all the rage. As I listen to this excellent album, I hear alot of the bands of my youth. Weezer or Nirvana certainly wouldn't have been the same band without The Pixies' influence. Modest Mouse can definatly claim them as an influence too. Why I've waited so long to get this album is beyond me..<br /><br />I can't really give this a proper review because I literally just started listening to it. It is, however, quite awesome with Debaser, Wave of Mutilation and Monkey Gone to Heaven being instant favorites.

0439806119|3.0|When I first picked up this book, I thought the premise was very intriguing.  A world full of beautiful people sounds like Heaven.  But as I got into the book more and more, it sounded more like you know where!  It took me a few chapters to really become engrossed in the book Uglies by Scott Westerfeld.  I was waiting for all the excitement to start happening.  The story is based around Tally Youngblood, an ugly about to turn pretty.  She meets Shay, an ugly that doesn't want to turn pretty.  Shay runs away and Tally is forced to bring her friend home or never turn pretty.  The events that follow start building up to the climax.  After the climax, the story doesn't really slow down.  The last sentence in the book will chill you to the bone and make you very excited about the next book.  After a slow start, I really started to care about Tally and her friends.  I can't wait to read the next book in the series, Pretties.

B0001XAPZ6|3.0|I wonder what my impression of this movie would have been if this were my first encounter with Miyazaki.  Yes, Nausicaa has the same remarkable imagination of Miyazaki found in all his films.  Fascinating and grotesque creatures abound throughout.  Unfortunately, this film simply does not hold up in comparison to the three other Miyazaki films I have yet seen (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle).    The real problem is probably that Miyazaki had not yet matured as a feature director.  There is too much dialogue when scenes would work just as well, or even better, if we were just allowed to be drawn in visually.  And as a whole it is poorly plotted.  Two hours was not too long for Spirited Away, but it is too long here.  I suspect that part of the problem was transitioning from the original serialized story to a longer piece.    One of the greatest reasons that Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle are more mature films is because they didn't take themselves so seriously.  The comic moments in both of those films easily survive translation.  Nausicaa also pales beside Princess Mononoke, in this case because the two films are so similar.  Hero works to save the remaining humans from rampaging forest creatures filled with rage at human abuse of the environment.  In the case of Mononoke, the ecological message serves the plot and characters.  In the case of Nausicaa, the ecological message is preachily rammed down our throats.    In the end, Nausicaa is more than decent, but it not Miyazaki's best.  The problem is that it does not distinguish itself enough from other anime films.  Don't watch it assuming that it will be another Spirited Away.  Watch it to see where Miyazaki has been, and to realize how far he has come.

B00001U0DP|5.0|How to show the horrors of the Holocaust?  Spielberg created scenes of almost documentary quality on black and white film in Schindler's List because he believed color would make it too terrible to watch.  Roberto Benigni chose to make his Holocaust film in gaudy quasi-Technicolor with unnaturally rosy cheeks, bright pink dresses, and bright green horses.  Its main character is a live-action cartoon, complete with slapstick humor, running sight gags, and broad yet deep romance.  The result?  Life Is Beautiful is more than gut-wrenching.  The humor doesn't ease the horror of the Holocaust or make a joke out of it.  Contrary to what some reviewers here say, the humor makes the reality of the Holocaust all the more grim in contrast.    While Spielberg certainly captured the facts (and one wonders if one way in which Benigni could be faulted is that he has made a Holocaust movie with no violence), Benigni's film has a different kind of very real emotional truth.  Life is Beautiful is a must see, recommended for everyone.  At the same time I don't think I could ever own it.  One to watch every ten years, if that, because it's so hard to watch.  Life is Beautiful is a singular movie--horrifying, sickening, but somehow you still remember the jokes after it.    From here on, there will be some spoilers:    It is not the basic plot which makes this movie good, but the way in which the story is told.  All of the advertisements and many of the reviews focus on Benigni's character.  (He did after all win several Best Actor awards around the world.)  During the film he does seem to monopolize the attentions of the audience and the onscreen characters around him.  But the mastery is evident in that much of the story Benigni is telling is actually told very subtly.  We can see the love Guido has for Joshua through the father's tireless antics despite his complete exhaustion after a day of hard labor.  But Dora's love for her husband and son is even greater than theirs for her.  She demands that she be put on the train with her family, even though she is not a Jew. And although Guido tries to involve other prisoners in his game with his son, their attempts are half-hearted at best.  He certainly hasn't eased their condition.  What's more, he knows that he wouldn't be joking if it weren't for his son.      Later, Guido's uncle instinctively helps a female German guard when she trips near him.  She is stunned and the audience should be as well.  On the opposite end of the spectrum of human kindness, Doctor Lessing seems to promise help for Guido and his family in the camp, only to ask Guido another riddle when they are able to meet in private.  It is the smallest actions which move this story forward, and which evidence just how well-told this story is.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|Probably the best psychological thriller in YEARS.  This is not an easy film to get in to, and it takes a lot of commitment to stay with it to the end.  The payoff is worth the wait.  I tend to call this type of film a \\"sleepy-thriller\\".  It moves along at its own pace, not overly concerned about the viewer's \\"timeframe\\".  Quite possibly the  best Bale movie I have ever seen.  His dedication to the role and his portrayal of Reznick is mesmerizing.  So much better than the typical Hollywood schlock.  Recommended!

0671434004|5.0|As a youngster, the vastness of the universe and the possibility of life beyond our planet fascinated me. That probably explains why, when as a teenager I first saw the movie adaptation of this book, I was moved greatly.<br /><br />A lonely young woman, who misses her father who passed when she was a child, devotes herself to the pursuit of making contact with life beyond our planet. That contact is made at the facility she manages, and the entire diplomatic and economic strength of the world is thrust behind the project to decode the Message and build the Machine. All of our conceited, egotistical superstitions, as well as our secular nationalist quarrels, are put aside as we are confronted with the reality that we are not alone.<br /><br />When our protagonist does makes contact, what does she learn? That there are others in the cosmos who have been here much longer than we have and are much more advanced, but do not have the answers to the fundamental questions that plague our shared existence. She learns that they have been looking for the same answers too, but in all their searching have found that what is really important is our connections with one another.<br /><br />Beautiful.<br /><br />While the film was able to be faithful to that central theme of the book, I think that the occasions of digression cheapen the message. Carl Sagan's written version is much, much more dynamic and ultimately intellectually and emotionally fulfilling.<br /><br />*Spoiler Warning*<br /><br />In the book there is no distracting romance between Dr. Arroway and Palmer Joss, the dialogue between the proponents of dogma and the proponents of science are much more interesting, there is no asinine suicide bomber sabotaging the Machine, the presence of the Five rather than simply Dr. Arroway adds to the concept of a shared human experience void of nationalistic identity, and in the end the \\"meaning of life\\" is something that Dr. Arroway ultimately learns rather than something she is simply told.<br /><br />*/Spoiler Warning*<br /><br />This is a fantastic book that I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of science fiction and has an overactive imagination regarding the cosmos and the possibility of life beyond our little planet. I had anticipated Sagan's literary style to be dry and unappealing and therefore delayed reading this novel, but I could not have been more pleasantly surprised. This book was for me a literal page turner.antastic book that I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of science fiction and has an overactive imagination regarding the cosmos and the possibility of life beyond our little planet.

B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|ive been looking for this film for a while now. wasnt hard to find once i remembered what it was called. Beautiful case and some interesting extras.
B00104W8T6|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD.  I would reccomend it to anyone thinking of buying it.
B000W9DSVW|4.0|I'm sure everyone has seen this series so my rating is not based on the plot or acting quality. Everything looks great in HD, of course. The problem is that because they are crooks (lovable crooks, but crooks nonetheless) their operations usually happen at night or in the dark. That means tons of film noise, which is gloriously captured in 1080p. I find that some of the night/dark shots are grainy to a point of being obvious, though not enough to annoy me. It's like two guys sitting next to you in the theater, constantly chatting away in low volumes. It doesn't distract from the movie, but you'd enjoy things a little more if it weren't there. That's the only minor imperfection I could find. Everything else is marvelous.
B00004T0US|5.0|All the songs from the original alblem are on here and sounds great Elvis poors his heart out on this.
B001ACY8D2|5.0|this album just shows how much a band can change direction while keeping their own style. i think that some fans might be upset that these songs are less like what they've heard before from sigur ros, but change can clearly be a good thing. if you need evidence of how the band has changed their approach, see the last song. it's in english and you can even kind of understand some of it.  every song here is fantastic anyway, so even if you like the \\"old\\" sigur ros and are worried about the new, you should give this album a chance.
0312330537|4.0|Rarely have I read a book that inspired such mixed feelings.  I want to emphasize right away that I really enjoyed this book and I've given it four stars despite exasperating faults because the story and story-telling are so enthralling.  That said, I struggled with the faults from cover to cover and they truly detract from what could be a five-star novel.    First, the good.  Roberts is a gifted story-teller.  He has a knack for parceling out pieces of the story in such a manner that you continuously get new information, but constantly want more of the story.  It's the recipe for an engrossing read.    Beyond that, Roberts creates some great characters.  Some reviews say the characters are straight out of central casting and/or are two-dimensional.  The first claim is frequently true, but the second usually misses its mark.  One of the things that makes this book strong is the life that Roberts breathes into many of the characters and their relationships with one another.  You tangibly feel Roberts affection for the people he describes and it separates this book from most others, making it a worthwhile read.    The story itself is apparently based on Roberts' own experiences and is gargantuan.  This becomes a strength and a flaw.  The novel has an epic quality to it, which is great, but by the end, you feel like you've traveled too far, gone too many places and experienced too many things too many times and you're just ready to be done.  Making the reader feel the hero's feelings may even be the intention of the book, but if that's the case, it would be better to experience the hero's fatigue because of the prose, not because of its length.    With that, let's move on to the less-than-great aspects of the book.  Roberts is absurdly fond of metaphor and deep philosophical meaning and never misses an opportunity to throw in either or - better yet - both.  So you get writing like, \\"The betrayal was an unsharpened butter knife twisting in the part of my gut just belowmy ribs, but above my belly button.  I knew as the insidious emotion viciously attacked the core of my being that his words had been true; trust never is given for free, it always exacts a price in the end.\\"  I made that one up for you, but the book is filled with examples that blow it out of the water on the laughter/nausea meter.    Too many of the characters in the book are amateur philosophers, constantly ready with a treatise on any topic at any time.  It rings hollow.  Roberts also loves to describe contrasting emotions being present at the same time, \\"His lips smiled while his eyes frowned.\\"  I think some variant of that concept appears about 50 times in the book.  Enough!    None of that keeps Shantaram from being a very strong book, it just keeps it from being the book that it might have been and puts it into the category of something a little too over-the-top.  Despite the distractions, I really enjoyed this book and recommend it.
B000Y8GFY8|5.0|Not an album that you'll like at 1st listen. But grows on you, it sure will! One of my fav albums of the year!!
B00003CXA2|2.0|What makes this film so irritating is its pro-American propoganda and religious undertones, which reaches levels few films dare to trot.    It's a fictional story of someone who was born mentally challenged. As a school kid he has a crush on a girl (who later becomes his wife). He is good at running (which gets him into college). He becomes a war hero and meets the president. He fulfills a promise he made to his dying best friend (who died in his arms) and enters the shrimp boat industry. He asks God to help him succeed and God (instead of making more shrimp) helps him by destroying every other shrimp boat (you can't make this stuff up) and Gump becomes super rich. He has a child with his future wife and the kid is the \\"smartest\\" in his class. And all throughout this improbable story, he remains blissfully ignorant at how extraordinary it is.    I want a film about the real world. This film does the mentally challenged no services. Rather, it patronizes them. If they decided to make a film based on a true story of a REAL mentally challenged person, I think I would have liked the film. And besides all that, this film is downright annoying. Someone had to say it. 2/5
B000TDGGRY|3.0|Not a bad summer read.  Decent plot, taught, unpredictable and just a few loose ends.
1416955070|3.0|I really found that i liked this book a lot but there were things about the plot line that just reminded me of Harry Potter written by another prespective.  I found it a little back and forth between charaters, but i still highly recomend it exsepcially if you havn't read the Harry Potter series.
0316067601|4.0|A friend was reading this book and I picked it up at an airport lay-over having a friend who's son became a SEAL a few years ago.    The odds of completing this most rigorus training among ALL the servies and earning the priviledge of wearing the Navy Trident, are very unlikly.  This writer tells in page flipping detail what they must indure and those few who tolerate the unbelievable 24/7 punishment and make it past Hell Week probably will graduate.  Sometimes less than 20% make it and these SEAL recruits are seasoned soldiers and most have made it through other demanding physical training including Rangers, Marine training ...some of the guys are even trying it for the second time!  One comes away with the greatest respect and graditude for these Special Operations voluntered American Soldiers.  No wonder they are respected around the world.  Beyong True Grit.
B0013J30W2|4.0|lOVED it i was truly entertain while watching this movie.<br />Great action and it was different for more me. I think its worth watching and can't wait for it to come out on DVD it is so going in my collection.
B000BHN7DE|4.0|All the Anastasia you'll ever need. The best white funky singer in the biz-the way she keeps tearing into a phrase with endless invention and tough humor is like the Mensa version of Shakira.

B000ZN8036|2.0|This is a great movie and its merits as a film have been well covered by many posts here. But this special \\"collector's edition\\" of a \\"two-disc\\" DVD is inexcusable. A five star film in a two-star DVD. In fact I gave this special edition two stars ONLY because the film is great. But the DVD offerings here are infantile and quite frankly a rip off. There are no special features on the first disc along with the movie. And the second disc only has two brief documentaries on the making of and some of the characters. Big deal. Granted, it's more than the original version of the DVD, but this is a rip. Oh, don't forget, they've got a trailer on the second disc. Yippie! Thank goodness I bought this DVD double-disc edition used or I'd be REALLY mad if I had paid full price. No commentaries, no real insight into Chris McCandless other than we do see his real parents in a couple shots. The \\"Experience\\" doc is good, but way too short. They could have added so much more. What a disappointment and a way to sell short a film and story that deserved and could have had so much more on this DVD. Lame.
1594489505|5.0|I had read and loved The Kite Runner, so I was eager to read this second novel by Hosseini.  I was expecting a good story.  I was not expecting a story so gut-wrenching that I would find myself clutching a box of tissues and so overwhelming that I would frequently hold my breath without even realizing it until I finally let it out.  The intertwining stories of the people in A Thousand Splendid Suns are special in that the characters live with so much despair and yet there is just a constant spark of hope - they keep hoping for better, and as a result, so does the reader.<br /><br />Khaled Hosseini is an insanely gifted storyteller, the likes of which most authors could only hope to be.  I can not applaud this book enough, it has become my favorite novel overall, knocking into second place a story that I loved for years (The Poisonwood Bible).<br /><br />I can only hope that Mr. Hosseini is currently hard at work on his third novel, because I will most certainly be buying it the instant it's available.<br /><br />If you read this book, it just might change the way you look at life - yours and the life of the people of Afghasnistan.
0316166685|5.0|To be really honest, I have never really wanted to read this book. It just didn't appeal to me. I didn't want to read about a brutual rape and murder of a young girl. It's the last thing I really wanted to read about but my book club suggested that we read it and since I am hosting the book club, I thought I'd better.     Once I picked it up, I literally could not put it down. I kept sneaking ways to find the time to read it by making the kids lay down for a nap, to take a bubble bath, you name it. I am, honestly, blown away by this book. It is not what I thought it would be. It is nothing what I thought it would be. The story line goes much deeper than the rape and murder (which the author thankfully spared the gristly details of). It goes into how the family fell apart in different ways to cope with the disappearance of the eldest daughter, Susie, who disappeared one winter night on her way home from school. With next-to-nothing clues to go on, the father becomes obssessed with the neighbor who he think did it. The mother drowns her sorrow into escaping from the family. Lindsey, the sister, had to endure the stigma of being the murdered girl's sister and Buck, the baby, had to endure everyone's loss as well as his. Not only did Susie's death affected her family, it affected two of the people she knew in life, her first love and a friend she barely knew.     Written from Susie's point of view as she observes life on earth from heaven, it is written in a very poignant way. This book should have come with a warning on the front cover, kleenexs are necessary while reading this book. It is written lyrically. It is haunting. It is unbelievably rich in spots with details and the sorrow lingers long after the last page has been turned. It is about how people deal with grief and how they move on in spite of the death of a loved one. It is about letting go and remembering. It is about life and death. In spite of its premises, it really isn't a book about revenge. It is about life.     I would recommend it to anyone who has heard about it. It is not what you may think it is, but it is also not a light book to read over the summer. It is a book about grief and loss. But it is also a book about hope and finding the way back to light and life again. It is also a book that will hold you in its grip till the last page has been turned. So, you're warned.    7/2/08
B000R7HY0K|4.0|Tarentino is no doubt in many lists of favorite Writer/Directors but with Grindhouse, he and Rodriguez have bought something old but new to the table. Tarentino's film Death Proof to me was just too good to pass up. I read the synopsis but I still for some reason just couldn't believe it. The film stars Kurt Russell among others but Russell is the most surprising character.<br /><br />Russell plays Stuntman Mike, who is basically a psycho in disguise and it certainly is not a good one.  Stuntman Mike has a black souped-up 1970 Chevy Nova that is what he calls, Death Proof. Stuntman Mike has a bit of a secret, he likes to kill women with his muscle car. He picks who he likes, then takes some pictures of them, and then waits for perfect timing when the women are driving of course, and then have a huge planned car accident.<br /><br />In the first half Mike stalks three friends Arlene(Vanessa Ferlito), Shanna(Jordan Ladd) and a local DJ named Julia Lucai(Sydney Tamiia Poitier). After he heals from the first hit, he moves on to his next victims.  The second victims who are unrelated to the first are Lee Montgomery (Mary Elizabeth Winestead), Abernathy Ross (Rosario Dawson), Kim Mathis (Tracie Thomas), and Zoe Bell. Zoe is visiting from out of town and Tracie and her friends are driving to pick her up from the airport. Tracie and Zoe just happen to be professional stuntwomen.<br /><br />This becomes very evident throughout the remaining scenes of he film. A local resident is selling a white 1970 Dodge Challenger and is advertising it in the paper. This car is the same car that was in the movie Vanishing Point. The car has caught Zoe's eye and she wants to test drive it or so she says. When Zoe, Tracie, and Abernathy decide to partake in a very risky game of \\"Ship's Mast\\" Mike takes this as an invitation. What Mike didn't know was that he messed with the wrong girls this time.  There was a lot that I loved about Death Proof and there was some stuff that I didn't like.<br /><br />I loved the characters; they were all unique and well written. They seemed like real people that reacted to the situations perfectly. The girls from the second half of the film were sick and amazing to complete the film nicely. The car chases were very intense and very fast. Not only will the crashes take your breath away but also what the second half of girls does to Stuntman Mike is jaw dropping, no lie.  What I didn't like about Death proof was the prolonged talking that felt like it would never end. This even made me want to give this movie 3.5 stars. Tarantino admits that he is not the greatest writer when it comes to dialogue and it shows in this film. The dialogue is a little dry in some spots and long-winded but despite this, the movie was still worthy of 4 stars. Other than that Death Proof was a great movie, I would say that the pacing was almost off but evened itself out in a good way. The action scenes were extremely exciting and I would recommend this to all Tarantino lovers for sure.rs; they were all unique and well written.

B0013FDM7E|5.0|It's always a risk reviewing films that were based on books. Especially the ones that have a huge fan base that the fans really really love. Now, I never read I am legend but Will Smith is an amazing actor and one of the best, so I had to see this. I Am Legend is very simple, it almost even reminds you of Cast Away though there're more people or should I say creatures in this film.<br /><br />Robert Neville is a Virologist Lieutenant Colonel for the U.S. Army. In an early scene in the film you see Neville rushing his family into a car while the rest of N.Y. is running scared in a panic. While Neville is explaining to his wife and real life daughter Marley what is going on, a sort of zombie looking creature hits their car.  It turns out that there has been an outbreak spread of a very lethal virus. Then you come to find out that Neville is the last healthy person in New York City and maybe even the world. He may be the last person but he is surely not alone.<br /><br />First, I have no idea how Tom Hanks won for Cast Away and Smith doesn't receive anything. I say this because Will Smith just killed this role and if you don't believe me then just check it out. He is in the film by himself for most of its time but he your attention is never somewhere else. He honestly had me excited to see what would happen next. He even shows how hard it is to be by yourself for so long by making his dog his best friend and talking to a mannequin at a local video store.  His performance was flawless without a doubt. Without him, I don't see or think anyone else could have possibly played this role as well as him.<br /><br />I thought that the creatures were very cool, not extremely scary but cool. I think the creatures could shock a few but not many but at the same time they create great suspense. You never really know what they're going to do, I loved that these things were also intelligent. The creature intelligence almost remind you of the zombies from George A. Romero's Land of the Dead.  I thought I Am Legend was a great movie, some may like it and some may not. I know some people that saw the preview and thought that the movie was a horror but trust me its not. You should totally check it out especially if you like Will Smith.Am Legend was a great movie, some may like it and some may not.

0440243661|5.0|Lee Child's Jack Reacher is SO unreal, so much of a caricature, that only a moron would enjoy reading about him, right?  Wrong.  There's something irrestible about Jack Reacher -- maybe it's the machismo so pathetically absent in much of our society.  The Reacher books are not terribly nuanced -- it's pretty black and white.  The bad guys are terrible; the good guys, pretty good.  So, you read Lee Child just to escape for a while into a world where the good guys win, instead of losing, as the media tends to portray things.  But, they tell me that in his latest book, \\"Nothing to Lose\\" Child goes off the deep end and gets political.  That would be a pity.  He'll lose me as a reader if that's the case.  I read Child for escape, not indoctrination.
B0018CWWLE|4.0|This DVD was bought with a lot of apprehension. I found that overall this is a good production. The reason it didn't score a 5 star rating is that I could have done without some of the fluffy pop stuff. That being said, this is a fairly inspired performance featuring some great playing. At the beginning of the show they seem a little sluggish and the songs don't flow with the usual power. But, the band warms up with great versions of Follow You, Follow me, Firth of Fifth and I Know what I Like. Ripples was a true highlight of the show. Phil sang it with so much heart. It was also nice to hear the band thank the Italians for saving them in the early days before they hit it so big. Overall worth the purchase to see this special concert.
1400064287|5.0|As a teacher I'm always looking for ideas that will help me make my presentations more memorable for my students. This book really brought home some ideas that I'd was vaguely aware of, but that never really bubbled up into my awareness. Not all the concepts were new, but were certainly presented in an interesting, even memorable, way.
B00004X10B|5.0|This is a great bag. I switched from a backpack style bag to this bag. It works better for me and allows easy access to all of my lenses and accessories. It is large enough to carry two camera bodies and several lenses and a flash unit along with filters, batteries, memory cards, and other miscellenous items. Over all a well constructed and well thought out bag.
B000F5FNSE|5.0|I'm like a lot of people who finished the Harry Potter series and needed something new for a daily dose of magic. After expressing to a friend on how much I love to read (but YA usually because they're quick and to the point) and in passing mentioned how I love mythology, loaned me this book. A week later, I ordered the rest of the series intrigued on what crazy shenanigans Percy Jackson would get into next.     The book kept me on my toes the whole way through and just when you think it is wrapping up, a new surprise comes your way. The character development of the main character is wonderful. I wanted to link him to Harry (dark hair, green eyes) but no, Percy is much more better than Harry. He's got attitude (a New Yorker through and through)and spunk which makes Harry fade into the background.     I recommend it for everyone who likes fantasy, regardless of age. It's a really fun book and I can't wait for the other three to get here.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|This movie is a great look at the rebellion and confusion of a person out of college and tired of the pressures and conformity of society.  It brings a beautiful and in-depth look into the mind of a young man not sure what he wants to do with is life, but pretty sure what he doesn't want.  I thought it was phenomenal especially if you wonder if the grass is greener on this other side of untamed life.  A young male's mind will relate with his stuggles and envy his passion for pursuing his \\"truth.\\"  A bit long for some, I absolutely enjoyed this wonder film and at this point in my life, I couldn't relate more.
B0015519VS|4.0|You're not gonna find another \\"Yeah!\\" here or another 8701. What you will find is a reflection of a real man in a real part of his life. This is the strongest effort I've heard out of Usher and I didn't skip any of the songs once I put the CD in. It did take a few listens to get the message, only because I myself am not in a committed, substantial relationship. It's a different, more mature vibe than his previous efforts considering that \\"Confessions\\" was a bit more mature than his first three efforts. My favorite cuts \\"Here I Stand\\", \\"Before I Met You\\", \\"Moving Mountains\\", \\"Trading Places\\", \\"The Best Thing\\" with Jay-Z and \\"Love You Gently\\". There are a few misteps like \\"This Ain't Sex\\" which sounds more like a demo for an unsigned artist than a track on a star's album. \\"Sex In Club Pt. 2\\" a terrible use of Beyonce & Lil' Wayne and what's the point of doing a second part when you have a remix with T.I.?. It would've been nice to see a more original cut with Beyonce on the album. Although he gave more than I expected, it would've been a near flawless album without the misteps.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I had seen this series on tv and it was truly amazing.  Now, having it on blu-ray...well...that's the icing on the cake!  I highly recommend this set of dvds.

1400032717|2.0|This book was recommended to me by a co worker and supervisor who both loved the book. While I know it's fiction, I really am bothered by a non- autistic person trying to write from the perspective of a child with Autism. This disorder is so unique to each child, I just think there are plenty of Autistic Adults who could write a novel and do a better job. I work daily with a student with autism and I know there are things that are sterotypical but I would just prefer to read something more 'realistic\\" that is also fiction. I get irritated when people throw their perceptions on special needs kids, when they are capable of telling you themselves....I am sure this is my issue...you may love the book as my supervisor and co-worker, also in the field and working with Autism daily did.<br />It is a difficult read I am half way through, can't seem to keep going but I am told it will get better as I go. There is a lot of cursing in the book as well as the child has no spiritual beliefs, which is something that also bugs me because every child I have worked with in the past 3 years has had some form of spirituality in their life.
0385340567|1.0|After reading all of the previous Jack Reacher novels, I was caught off guard by Child's left wing politics. This will end my Lee Child readings.

B0018TLRTU|4.0|Given Billy Idol's \\"Greatest Hits\\" (2001) came out a mere seven years ago, it seems kind of odd that a second compilation album is out now with \\"The Very Best of Billy Idol: Idolize Yourself\\" (2008). After all, since the last greatest hits, Billy's only released one more album, the underappreciated, hard rocking \\"Devil's \\"Playground,\\" (2005) so what's the point?<br /><br />Necessary or not, \\"Idolize Yourself\\" is still a strong compilation that's probably a cut above the first \\"Greatest Hits.\\"<br /><br />18 tracks total, \\"Idolize Yourself\\" contains almost an identical track listing as \\"Greatest Hits,\\" except that \\"Rebel Yell (acoustic)\\" and a cover of the Simple Minds \\"(Don't You) Forget about me\\" are left off, and replaced with \\"Speed\\" from the soundtrack of the same name (1994), \\"World Comin' Down\\" from \\"Devils Playground\\" as well as two new songs \\"John Wayne\\" and \\"New Future Weapon.\\" While the Simple Minds cover is missed, the loss of \\"Rebel Yell (acoustic)\\" isn't that big a deal.<br /><br />Much like \\"Greatest Hits,\\" \\"Idolize Yourself\\" does a pretty good job at selecting the hits and best tracks from Idol's first three albums \\"Billy Idol,\\" (1982) \\"Rebel Yell\\" (1983) and \\"Whiplash Smile,\\" (1986) although a more dedicated listener will probably want to get all three of those albums as they are all worth owning and contain many gems that aren't as well known. I do have to say, however, that I am displeased that the radio edit of \\"Don't Need a Gun\\" is included here instead of the album version (from \\"Whiplash Smile\\"). While it's only about a minute or so shorter and may not seem like a big deal--it is. The radio edit really misses something, as Stevens awesome solo is cut short.<br /><br />I also have a bone to pick with the selections from some of the later day albums. While you have to include \\"Cradle of Love,\\" from \\"Charmed Life,\\" (1990) \\"Idolize Yourself\\" would have been better served if it had left off the cover of the Doors \\"LA Woman,\\" as it is just plain terrible.

The two new songs, the moody new-wave-ish \\"John Wayne\\" and the hard rocking \\"New Future Weapons\\" are pretty solid and should please most Idol enthusiasts.     In conclusion, while some tracks could have been left off and others included, \\"Idolize Yourself\\" is still an excellent compilation that should fit the needs of most casual fans.

B0018TLRTK|4.0|Given Billy Idol's \\"Greatest Hits\\" (2001) came out a mere seven years ago, it seems kind of odd that a second compilation album is out now with \\"The Very Best of Billy Idol: Idolize Yourself\\" (2008). After all, since the last greatest hits, Billy's only released one more album, the underappreciated, hard rocking \\"Devil's \\"Playground,\\" (2005) so what's the point?<br /><br />Necessary or not, \\"Idolize Yourself\\" is still a strong compilation that's probably a cut above the first \\"Greatest Hits.\\"<br /><br />18 tracks total, \\"Idolize Yourself\\" contains almost an identical track listing as \\"Greatest Hits,\\" except that \\"Rebel Yell (acoustic)\\" and a cover of the Simple Minds \\"(Don't You) Forget about me\\" are left off, and replaced with \\"Speed\\" from the soundtrack of the same name (1994), \\"World Comin' Down\\" from \\"Devils Playground\\" as well as two new songs \\"John Wayne\\" and \\"New Future Weapon.\\" While the Simple Minds cover is missed, the loss of \\"Rebel Yell (acoustic)\\" isn't that big a deal.<br /><br />Much like \\"Greatest Hits,\\" \\"Idolize Yourself\\" does a pretty good job at selecting the hits and best tracks from Idol's first three albums \\"Billy Idol,\\" (1982) \\"Rebel Yell\\" (1983) and \\"Whiplash Smile,\\" (1986) although a more dedicated listener will probably want to get all three of those albums as they are all worth owning and contain many gems that aren't as well known. I do have to say, however, that I am displeased that the radio edit of \\"Don't Need a Gun\\" is included here instead of the album version (from \\"Whiplash Smile\\"). While it's only about a minute or so shorter and may not seem like a big deal--it is. The radio edit really misses something, as Stevens awesome solo is cut short.<br /><br />I also have a bone to pick with the selections from some of the later day albums. While you have to include \\"Cradle of Love,\\" from \\"Charmed Life,\\" (1990) \\"Idolize Yourself\\" would have been better served if it had left off the cover of the Doors \\"LA Woman,\\" as it is just plain terrible. Yes, it was a hit, but a hit to forget. \\"The Loveless\\" or \\"Prodigal Blues\\" are far stronger and would have made better choices.<br /><br />\\"Idolize Yourself\\" also could have done without \\"Shock to the System.\\" That song as well as all of \\"Cyberpunk\\" (1993) just plain sucks. Hey if Van Halen didn't acknowledge \\"3,\\" on their best of anthology, Mr. Idol can do the same for his one misguided venture.<br /><br />It's also a shame that only one track from \\"Devil's Playground\\" is included as that album is pretty killer.

B000000WJZ|4.0|Siamese Dream by Smashing Pumpkins really brought this indie rock band into the limelight. Frontman Billy Corgan has an unique voice and his songwriting is pure heart even when he sings about nothing profound. Songs like Today, Rocket, Maynnoise, and the song that got me hooked, Disarm (still one of my favorite songs of all-time). This is a great album from the early '90s and this cd was produced by Butch Vig who went on to form his own band, Garbage. Get this classic today!
B000BMPQUG|5.0|Do not understand how they never became popular here in the States. These are great songs and great videos from the early years of Take That. The singing and songwriting from Gary Barlow is wonderful.
078322933X|4.0|Fear starring Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon is a wicked thriller to say the least. The film also stars William Petersen and Amy Brenneman. Wahlberg plays a psycho boyfriend and Witherspoon is very effective as the naive teenager he falls for. I like this film, some of the scenes seem kinda silly now but overall Fear will keep you coming back for another viewing, enjoy!

0743496736|3.0|A fast and gripping read, Nineteen Minutes is a good book for Book Clubs. It touches on a number of issues facing children today, including bullying, school violence, and physical abuse. Some of the book's characters are developed and flushed out so well, that readers will find themselves sympathic to those characters they never thought they would be.     If your Book Club has fallen into a routine of stale discussions, Nineteen Minutes is sure to end the monotony.

B000002J09|5.0|This Led Zeppelin album is one of those albums that's a little hard to classify since virtually every style they've been known for is represented. It's also the beginning of unconventional artsy album covers as there are no pictures of the band, nor does the name Led Zeppelin appear. In the days of LP records, only the lyrics of \\"Starway to Heaven\\" could be found in the inner sleeve and the 4 individal symbols for each band member. Technically, there's no official name for the album, though fans have called it \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" or \\"Zoso\\" or \\"Runes\\" or even \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\"    The hard rockin' \\"Black Dog\\" starts out this album. Guitarist Jimmy Page hits the E chord several times and then Robert Plant sings \\"Hey, hey, mama, say the way you move, gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove.\\" Page, bassist John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham answer furiously. All of the members shine on here.    \\"Rock and Roll\\" follows, a 1950's Chuck Berry style rocker. Bonham (aka Bonzo) hits the snare drum for the intro and Page lets loose with a killer riff. Jonesy adds some Jerry Lee Lewis style piano. I'll bet you won't be able to just stand still and listen to this song!    The English folk piece \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" helps mellow the mood. Page plays an acoustic guitar here, Jonesy plays mandolin and Plant shares lead with Sandy Denny. The lyrics speak of Tolkien influence.    \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" needs no introduction. What could I tell you that you haven't read on this page already? If you've ever had the dial on FM somewhere, you're quite familiar with this close-to-8 minute epic. In fact, I'll bet even some of your parents listened in bewilderment even in 1971. Folk and hard rock are combined in this song. The song's lyrics have been interpreted on many levels.    \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" sounds enigmatic in the verses, both melodically and lyrically. Jonesy starts it off with an electric piano riff (A, G, E) with Page answering the riff on guitar, with Bonzo addingin a fill on drums. Plant multitracks his voice.    \\"Four Sticks\\" is an Eastern sounding rocker, heavier than \\"Friends\\" and perhaps a precursor to \\"Kashmir.\\"    The 1960's style folk ditty \\"Going to California\\" mellows the mood again, with an acoustic guitar from Page and Plant singing in an uncharacteristic baritone. The lyrics seem to speak of hoping to find happiness out in California.    \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" is the only blues song on the album. It is also the only song where Plant plays harmonica. The song is based off an old Memphis Minnie blues standard and for 7 minutes Led Zeppelin plays raunchy blues, ending with an unusual coda, which sounds almost like an abrupt earthquake (I don't know for sure but it sounds like Page is playing a banjo through an amplifier).
B0017XFBMG|5.0|My. God.    This is no \\"best of\\" box set, recycling the same stuff you've already got in your collection...I own just about every official and unofficial recording the Pogues have ever released, and this compilation is almost entirely new to me.  Live tracks.  Demos.  Peel Sessions.  Remixes.    More than just a box set, this is archival stuff - the recorded history of one of the best (and most influential) bands in the history or rock music.    The sound quality is almost as impressive as the content itself - really wonderful remastering work.    Just buy it...assuming amazon ever gets it back in stock.
1423101464|5.0|Ever since I picked up the first Percy Jackson book, I knew he was the one for me. Percy is caring and brave.. and funny counts for something. I know lots of parents read these too. I have re-read and re-lived the whole series again, which makes me realize how great these books are. I have recommended them to anyone and everyone.       The fourth book didn't disapoint me. Although I won't give the full summary of the story (it's been a month since I read it), basically Percy goes to a new school, whcih has its share of trouble for him. Again, like all the other books, there is a quest. I found this quest to be the most exciting for me. There were lots of new characters introduced, like Hera, so I found that very awesome, since I have always liked Greek mythology.       SPOILERS!!!!  Of course, as I am a true romantic, I found the blossoming romance between Annabetha and Percy addicting. I was literally flipping the pages, going \\"When do they meet again?\\" Annabeth kisses Percy at Mount St. Helens, therefore expressing her feelings for him, but Percy is too dense to realized that she does like him like that. He knows he is in love with her but his concentraion on thisdelicate matter is disrupted by the return of Rachel Elizabeth Dare and the landing of Percy on Calypso's island. Calypso is banished to this island because she helped the Titans in the big war. Every thousand years or so, the gods are cruel and send her a hero to nurse back to health. Calypso falls in love with them and begs them to stay, but they must return to their own world. They can never find the island again. Percy is very torn between staying and going to save the world, but eventually leaves. I was really sad actually he didn't stay with Calypso. Although I have always been a fan of Annabetha nd such, something about Calypso made me like her, maybe because she was so accepting. Then there is Rachel. Ahh, Rachel. Annabeth is very jealous of this girl as Percy keeps accidently running into her andis becoming one of her best friends. Matter of fact, Annabeth stalks off mad quite a few times in the presence of Percy and Rachel. Percy, dense as ever, doesn't realize why, but I don't think Rachel would ever take him from Annabeth. She knows waht he doesn't.    And here ends my review of the blossoming romance. I promise I'll be more critical with my next review, but I have troulbe remembering the action unless I just read it. Ohh, Percy Jackson fans: the movie is going to come out next year!! I'm excited of course. I would like to be Annabeth haha. I find her really cool. Sigh. I am not an actress however. So read this book, please!
0151013837|5.0|This is a beautifully illustrated, Booker Prize winning, modern classic in hardback for four bucks and change. Just buy it.
B0010358CG|3.0|The story was pretty interesting, and the action was phenomenal.  However, I thought they could have done better with  the character animation.  Final Fantasy had better animation.  Still, the movie is is still worth watching.
B00133KFGW|4.0|The previous reviews relating the plot and very strong cast are excellent and I agree with them.  I had to let my \\"inner child\\" take over at the contrived ending which was totally unbelievable but, who cares?  Watching it made you feel terrific - just turn your intellect off for a few minutes.  I would give this movie 5 stars for the entire movie, save the conclusion which was unbelievable but still moving.  I rented it on demand and will buy to add to my collection of other \\"feel good\\" movies.  This is one to keep and great for the entire family.  I think children would really enjoy it as well.  I felt it conveyed the way we musicians feel and \\"hear\\" music - or unfortunately for many people - who don't.  Studies have shown that our brains are \\"hard wired\\" for music appreciation and this film certainly shows that beautifully.  I highly recommend this film for anyone who has ever loved a piece of music and wants an escape from our daily drudge even if you must suspend belief.  As an opera lover, I do that all the time!  This film makes it very easy to do!  To see it and hear it - is to love it.
B000LC3IDI|4.0|The ending.... wow.  Totally worth the crazyness. Better than #2, but idk if anything was better than the first.
B0018OAPAW|5.0|There are bands who make 2 out of 8 good albums and generally the more they make the worse they get.  I honestly do NOT believe that The Offspring is not one of them.  I really, really liked this album.  I've been listening to them since Ignition and I'm actually impressed for several reasons.  For one they've kept their style of music, they've always been true to their art.  There are other reviews saying this album isn't as good as other ones, and maybe not as fast.  But here's the thing...they still create their style.  No one can say this doesn't sound like Offspring because it does, they've only become more creative, adaptive yet still original.  And for those who do complain that this doesn't sound exactly like their other albums should be glad.  If it did others would comment that this is nothing new and it sounds like all their other albums.  Honestly I think musically, this is their best album.  More thought went not only into the words but the musical arrangement.  I actually felt emotion (other than anger or frustration) in most of the songs.  And the songs hit hard.  So if you can appreciate an honest band perfecting their art you'll love this album.  And I'm glad they continue to do what they do.
0786948523|4.0|Without comparing this book to its previous editions as many reviewers have done, I'm going to review it based on its own merits.<br /><br />The art, for the most part, is pretty good....and it's everywhere. There is no lack of visual inspiration to stoke the imagination. There are a few pieces that seem particularly appropriate for a \\"Monster\\" Manual...in the first few pages are some truly horrific-looking beasties, and there are more than a couple illustrations that simply scream \\"I WANT TO DEVOUR YOUR SOUL.\\"<br /><br />The layout is good, with monsters laid out in alphabetical order. There are several different indexes in the back, allowing players to look up monsters by level, by name, etc. Very handy for DMs who're setting up encounters. Also, it's easy to locate the quirkier parts of the book, like the optional PC races.<br /><br />The only real reason I give this book a four instead of a five is the lack of fluff. While my imagination is just fine, I would have liked just a little more in the way of fiction for these guys to offer thought-fodder for adventures.<br /><br />All in all, a decent book.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I think the swivel sweeper is better than a dust pan and broom. Cleans the floors a little better than a broom, but also you don't have to bend to sweep up a pile, and it works faster than a broom. Of course it is not perfect, like the fact that it doesn't get everything perfectly, and things get tangled in the brushes. Also it is not that great for carpets so I prefer my vacum on carpets, but if you have mostly hard wood or tile it is perfect. Overall I love this product, and it makes my cleaning easier.    *UPDATE* After having this for three months the battery wouldn't hold a charge anymore. After this happened to me I did research and found this happened to many others. I also asked my sister and mother-in-law who also bought it, and they too had the problem with the battery. My sister even bought a replacement and it happened again. Do not buy this!
B000Q9IZ5C|2.0|Not as good as the show, although if you've loved the show then you should really get the graphic novel. The movie was made for newcomers who would may have knew nothing about the show firefly. Therefore it is not as great as it could have been what Joss should have done is made it for fans instead of trying to make it for new comers but ... I can't complain about what has already been done.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This Blu-ray version is the perfect and now, the only right way to see this movie. Let's face it's just the best movie of all time
076790592X|2.0|After reading \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven,\\" by the same author, and reading/hearing comments about \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" I really thought this was going to be a great read also-- but it wasn't. Reviewers make it seem as though there are so many revealing thoughts and lessons to be learned through this book, however, I found most of them to be common sense based. It was interesting to follow how this elderly man degenerates, yet keeps a positive attitude all throughout. Nonetheless, it wasn't as engaging to read as \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven.\\"
B00003XAVA|5.0|This is nothng short of a brilliant collaboration between two of this century's finest musicians. The songs are superb-the playing equally matched if not exceeded, and the sound quality is greatly benefited by the ex-<br />cellent remastering job. I was thinking how awesome it would be to see a vast boxed set that would collect<br />all the very finest works from all four of these guys-I know it would be very anticipated by many, but for now<br />there is a huge volume of music to collect from CSNY.

And agonizing cramps do indeed make you ''present''! Trust me, you don't dwell in the future or the past when the menses descend.    Honestly, can anyone get through this book without laughing aloud at certain points? I do not denigrate the search for spirituality, but never before have I heard it delivered by someone so humorless and pompous. Pass me the Midol...
B000002KD9|5.0|This is still one of my favorite albums of all time, and I just discovered how good it sounds in headphones (great stereo spread), however I am listening to Oh lonesome me, and it is in mono-I think I remember that from when I had it on LP. Anyway, I don't think old Neil did any better than here. The songs are all great, and his voice is in perfect shape!
0385340567|5.0|I'm probably not the first to use that title, but it's true for anyone interested in action/adventure good-over-evil stories.  Jack Reacher is a rough-and-ready character who pulls no punches and almost always gets his way in the end.  Lee Child has created a wonderfull and consistently enjoyable series.
B0018AK9RA|1.0|There are scant few successful \\"concept\\" albums in the past.  What made Rob think that his would somehow be better than all the rest?  This album is an abysmal bore by almost any standard - musically, lyrically, content-wise.  Save your money.
B000OVLBFS|4.0|I'm a fan of Robert Parkers \\"Paradise\\" series featuring the Jesse Stone character.  I like his Spenser books somewhat less because the Spenser character has grown tiresome and repetitive over too many installments (to me at least).    Tom Selleck is perfect as Jesse Stone, a brooding Police Chief of a small New England township.  He's battling alcoholism and a continuing love connection to his ex-wife. This character is pretty much the polar opposite of his Magnum P.I. character but he nails it - just enough brooding with sparks of wry humor.  These series of movies (Stone Cold, Death in Paradise, and Night Passage are three of four, I think) are all beautifully shot and feature a great supporting cast.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This much-anticipated 4th album departs from the usual Coldplay, and has more fire in it, more lust, more rock, better lyrics....but is still a little soft!<br /><br />I was expecting something stronger, more anthematic. That said, there are some great tracks. Brian Eno has added a more U2 rock sound. There are some classic Coldplay tracks like \\"42\\", an emotive piano melody. \\"Lovers in Japan\\" is the most familiar Coldplay track, and although familiar territory, it is perhaps the weakest of the album.<br /><br />\\"Yes\\" is a classic sturdier coldplay, more masculine, and perhaps heavily influenced by Eno. Definitely one of my favourites on this album, it incorporates African and Latin elements with the best of Coldplay.<br /><br />\\"Viva la Vida\\" the title track is an anthematic track which still doesn't go far enough to explain its title, or the title of the album for that matter. What is the link to Frieda Kahlo exactly? This should get decent<br />playing time on the radio, as it's quite catchy, despite the unusual lyric.<br /><br />\\"Violet Hill\\" will probably get the most radio time, it's arguably the strongest track in the album, combining interesting lyrics, with passionate, nuanced arrangement, and a fresh break from previous coldplay hits.<br /><br />Viva la Vida is darker and more emotive than previous work. At times there is more passion, and a harder edge. I would still like to see an even darker side to the band. The title is \\"Death and All His Friends\\" after all! I feel a bit cheated by the album not delivering on the title.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Brilliant, yes.<br />Mainstream, partly.<br />Dark, no.<br />Poignant, yes.<br />Self-conscious, yes.<br />Worth owning, definitely.
B0013J30W2|4.0|And people too.<br /><br />I wanted the movie to be exciting. I wanted an adventure. I wanted action. I wanted to see more of James McAvoy. I wanted to have a good time. I wanted to enjoy an evening at the movies. I got what I wanted, all of the above, but at the same time I suppose I also wanted the movie to be perfect: perfect script, perfect story, perfect plausibility, perfect character development. That's a lot to ask of any movie. But there it was, sitting next to me in the empty seat, snuck in with me and didn't even have to pay to see the show. On any other day it would have been the death of the movie for me.<br /><br />This has happened repeatedly for movies and me. If we don't see eye-to-eye on that first date, there's hardly a chance that I'll ever look at the dating possibilities again. The Princess Bride has suffered this irrevocable fate from an unfortunate head-on collision with an idealized, college-aged version of me. The movie never took itself seriously enough. Or maybe I'd just always taken myself too seriously. Whichever, the experience is a lost one, one that cannot be altered. The Princess Bride will never get a fair chance to just be itself with me. I'm to invested in wanting it to be something else, wanting it to be more perfect in ways in maybe didn't much care about.<br /><br />I did the same thing several years earlier with David Lynch's Dune. Somehow with Dune, though, 20 years later I found a way to re-encounter the film on its own merits. I found a way to drop the baggage I had taken with me the first time and look at the movie from a different perspective. I saw not what I had wanted to see as a teenager, but I saw what the creative artists were presenting. If you miss what is on the screen, what the artists have put there, then you aren't really talking about the movie. You're talking about you. I guess I let go of making this one film about me. But that sort of thing is a rarity for me.<br /><br />Some other unfortunate victims of my desire for several kinds of perfection over the years: Forrest Gump, The Fifth Element, the entire canon of Classic Disney films, Spaceballs and every Mel Brooks film that followed, Waiting for Guffman, and the musical as a genre. Even the Beatles were relegated for a decade or more to the shelves of \\"less than important moments that could easily be forgotten, or erased from history altogether without loss.\\" As a teenager I could watch Caveman with Ringo Starr and Shelley Long, over and over as it played and replayed on HBO, but just a few years later I was turning up my nose to The Princess Bride. What changed that long time ago, and what has now changed back again, today? (Wednesday night actually.) The acceptance finally that perfection is truly unattainable? No, that would be too obvious. Too easy.<br /><br />I've been struggling in a very broken environment for far too long. I've tried fixing it. I've tried introducing concepts of perfection to it. I've tried to allow time to do its magic and \\"heal all wounds\\". But it's like trying to re-weld a pot metal belt buckle. It's like trying to re-connect two broken pieces of polystyrene, and all you do with chemicals or heat or adhesives is melting the joints, further destroying the very materials themselves, or making a really ugly patch job. The thing just becomes another lifeless pile of goo. You can't keep re-shaping it into the thing it once was.  So it's time to throw away that which is broke and go somewhere else. But if I go there looking for perfection, I'm going to be recycling the last twenty years of my life all over again. I need to look at each new situation as an imperfect one, not a potentially perfect one. (And people too.) These imperfections are what makes these things real. The are part of our collective humanity. And I need to accept that. No, I need to embrace imperfection. Broken, worn-out, neglected, mistreated, self-destructive, these things I can do without. But the ordinary, garden variety of imperfection, hell, even a healthy dose of it, that is everywhere, and it is essential to what it means to be human. That I can accept.<br /><br />As for McAvoy, Jolie, the script, and the movie, I can accept that in you too. Because there is genuine strength along side the moments of imperfection. That's also a very human trait.thy dose of it, that is everywhere, and it is essential to what it means to be human. That I can accept.    As for McAvoy, Jolie, the script, and the movie, I can accept that in you too. Because there is genuine strength along side the moments of imperfection. That's also a very human trait.

B0018TLRTU|4.0|I watched an inteview with Billy and apparently it was EMI's idea to do another hits CD. They told him to add a couple new tracks as well. That is the reason for this release.     At first I was hesitant to purchase this yet another \\"greatest\\" collection because most of the songs are already on his Greatest Hits from 2001, which I already own. However, after hearing the two new tracks on his website plus the bonus DVD of his awesome videos... well, I had to have it. I only wish that Prodigal Blues was labeled one of his best. I think it was so underplayed when Charmed Life was released. I disagree with the first reviewer about LA Woman being a terrible cover. There is a reason it is one of his hits. I love the energy of that song. It's definitely one of my faves. The videos are great and it really takes me back to the days when MTV actually played videos. Billy is definitely a pioneer of rock videos. His are some of the most unforgettable in history. Again, too bad Prodigal Blues was not included, that is probably my favorite Idol video. Anyway, buy this if you don't have the hits.... or even if you do if but just for the DVD. It's worth it. If nothing else, it's a great way for \\"the man\\" to get himself back out on tour and not fade away into history. This icon will never be an aging, has-been product of the 80s. The new tracks prove that he still has what it takes to rock out his fans. He is truly timeless. And really, can you ever hear Rebel Yell enough?

B000IJ7Q32|4.0|Jared Diamond's at it again, providing a comprehensive view of the real root causes and conditions that have brought past civilizations to an end and what we can learn from them today. Though he delves on pre-set circumstances to help determine an outcome of society, he still leaves room for human variables and conscious decisions as we are capable of making. In fact, he not only leaves room for it but insists on its importance when he says from all his background and experience that he is \\"cautiously optimistic\\" about mankind's future prospects, depending on how we plan and react to those pre-set circumstances in the future... A decision which we ultimately face and continue to face.    The book can be quite dry at times as it is not a story but an anthropology, yet stick with it as I believe it changed my way of viewing the world and how important our relationship to Earth is.

Zack fulfills the parental role for Cody, although at times grudgingly, as he gives up hope for a better future on the other side of the tracks and resigns himself to a life of flipping burgers.<br /><br />Suddenly Zack cannot suppress his feelings for Shaun, but nobody is really thrilled with the revelation that Zack might be gay.  Zack must decide between his own needs and dreams (whatever he decides they are) and the needs and requirements of his family.<br /><br />Brad Rowe, last seen in [[ASIN:1573624381 Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss]] finds material much more worthy and he rises to the occasion.  Actually, all the acting and production in this film is good and the tone and pace of the film are well-executed and effective.<br /><br />Along with gay and straight parenting/family issues, there is a good examination about the relationship between two men of somewhat differing ages, economic backgrounds, and in different stages of coming out to themselves and their families.<br /><br />This is a great movie overall and a great example of modern gay-themed movies.  Highly recommended.
B000002JNJ|5.0|Pantera's \\"Cowboys From Hell\\" is one of the greatest and most influential albums in the history of metal. When you look back at all the bands influenced by this album between 1990 and now, it's pretty amazing. But, influence aside, this album is just generally awesome.  We got Phil Anselmo on lead vocals, who can go from a deep, distorted growl to a high-pitched wailer of a note! Vinnie Paul is definitely an impressive drummer who adds some great fills and rhythms to the songs. Rex Brown mostly stay low-key but his basswork runs smoothly through the album.  Then there's the guitarist: Dimebag Darrell. A legend of our modern time, taken away from us far too young. But as for this album, he really shines here, ripping out some blazing riffs, melodies and solos throughout the entire album. Here's what I think about some of my favorite songs on an album that shattered metal!  \\"Cowboys From Hell\\" has a great build-up of an opener, and kicks out some great, heavy riffs, full of infectious grooves, and a great guitar solo, along with the shout-a-long chorus to boot.  \\"Primal Concrete Sledge\\" is the thrashiest song on the album, and only lasts 2:13. With the fast-paced, low, chugging guitar riffs, pounding drums and a Middle Eastern-tinged guitar solo, this is a great one. Plus, it features some of Phil's fastest singing around.  \\"Psycho Holiday\\" is the complete opposite of \\"Primal Concrete Sledge\\", adding an incredible amount of funk and grooves, it almost sounds like Metallica combined with Red Hot Chili Peppers. Bouncing, heavy riffs, polyrhythmic drumming and a guitar solo that lasts for a headbanging minute, this is sure to please all metalheads.  \\"Heresy\\" is another song in the thrashier vein, with more wild and high-pitched vocals from Phil and fast, chugging riffs, mixed with great drumming.  \\"Cemetery Gates\\" is a beautiful, Southern-rock styled ballad-turned-rocker with melodic acoustic passages, some beautiful singing and then hardcore screeching by Phil, an eerieelectric riff and an amazing guitar solo. A definitely masterpiece.  \\"Domination\\" is a cross between fast grooves and chugging melodies, with one of Dimebag Darrell's greatest guitar solos and awesome verses sung by Phil.  \\"Shattered\\" is another song in speed-metal territory, with fast, complex riffs and some of Phil's greatest upper-range singing around. A real feast for a thrasher!  \\"Medicine Man\\" has some cool basswork, a catchy groove and deep singing by Phil, along with another signature heavy chorus!  \\"The Sleep\\" is the second epic-ballad-turned-rocker, after \\"Cemetery Gates\\". Featuring an exotic chord strum, dark, horror-themed lyrics and more deep, melodic singing by Phil, like on \\"Cemetery Gates\\", this is another great one!  \\"The Art of Shredding\\" closes the album with some more great riffage and a grooving bassline, high-pitched screaming from Phil and a somewhat random frenzy towards the end, that rocks out until the end.  As you notice, I didn't rate \\"Clash With Reality\\" or \\"Message In Blood\\", because I really don't listen to those two much, even though they're still great songs. Well, to summarize my review, if you want a great metal album with lots of talent, grooves and songwriting, \\"Cowboys From Hell\\" is a great choice. Thanks for the time, and peace.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have never seen Buffy or Angel, never seen Babylon 5 or Farscape, and my entire exposure to Star Trek is less than five accidentally watched episodes. I don't read sci fi. I don't watch sci fi. I watched Firefly because it was highly recommended by a friend.<br /><br />I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />It is funny, exciting, clever, fun, has interesting characters, attractive (very) actors and actresses and a feeling of watching an old western with a twist.<br /><br />I read through some of the negative reviews (many of which are five star and the reviewer thought one star meant they liked it... seriously) and I should point out some things to people planning to watch Firefly:<br /><br />There are no aliens in Firefly. A lot of reviewers seems to equate aliens with sci fi as a prime element. Well, Firefly has no aliens.<br /><br />Firefly is essentially a space western. It makes use of old style western movie quips and puns, and relationship dynamics that were popular in 1960's western films. Hence, the noble and headstrong captain of the ship makes jokes and puns before a shootout, the hard bitten mercenary is a lovable idiot and such.<br /><br />Since it is essentially a western, it takes place on outer planets where settlers are trying to survive. Cowboy-like life makes sense in this aspect. It is the new wild frontier.<br /><br />The special effects are very good for a TV show.<br /><br />The show is good enough to have gained a large cult following of which I am surprisingly now a member of (Browncoats!)<br /><br />It is a good show, and did not deserve to be cancelled. it is a shame there are only 14 episodes.
B00000IN5G|5.0|\\"Hatebreeder\\" is an incredibly solid album by Children of Bodom, and between their extremely tight and impressive musicianship, solid songwriting and Alexi Laiho's trademark shriek, are definitely one of the strongest metal bands in the present day, regardless of how recognized they are by the public eye.  This album has everything a great extreme metal album would have: jaw-dropping guitar and keyboard duos, complex drumming complete with rapid double bass, intruging lyrics (even if they're not on the level of other music artists, but that doesn't lessen the greatness of this album), and barking vocals. Plus, you get mind-blowing speed on songs such as \\"Warheart\\" and \\"Silent Night, Bodom Night\\". Honestly, the tremolo guitar tapping and hammer-ons of Silent Night, Bodom Night are just so energetic! Plus, the band takes on a romantic theme in \\"Bed of Razorz\\", and an epic sort of storytelling in \\"Downfall\\", plus all the other songs are just as well-written and headbang-able.  So, in short Children of Bodom's \\"Hatebreeder\\" is indeed a modern metal classic, and touches base with extreme power metal, melodic death metal, black metal and speed metal. Fans of any of these genres will definitely love this album as I do. Also, I would recommend getting the version with the two, extra songs and the music video, but either way, you're getting a classic with this one. Thanks for the time, and peace.
B0017I1FO4|4.0|*\\"Devour.\\" Fast, high-tempo, with pretty good lyrics and melody. Gets a little repetitive, though.<br />*\\"The Sound of Madness.\\" A moderate song with great percussion and guitar, but a weaker melody.<br />*\\"Second Chances.\\" A slower song than the previous ones, but still has a good tempo, percussion, and some good powerful vocals.<br />*\\"Cry for Help.\\" Faster song with awesome guitars, percussion, and lyrics.<br />*\\"The Crow and the Butterfly.\\" Slower, with strong chorus.<br />*\\"If You Only Knew.\\" This seems like a typical, upbeat rock song. It has good vocals, but seems watered-down.<br />*\\"Sin With a Grin.\\" Much stronger with great guitars, percussion, and awesome lyrics and melody.<br />*\\"What a Shame.\\" A hefty downbeat song; sounds good.<br />*\\"Cyanide Sweet Tooth Suicide.\\" High-tempo hard rock; pretty darn awesome!<br />*\\"Breaking Inside.\\" Another softer song, with strong guitar. Pretty good.<br />*\\"Call Me.\\" No, this is not a cover of Blondie. This is a soft piano song with rock lyrics. Pretty good, sentimental end for the album.<br /><br />If you have the \\"Fan Club Edition,\\" you get the following bonus tracks:<br /><br />*\\"I Own You.\\" Very good hard rock song; awesome guitars, percussion, and vocals.<br />*\\"The Energy.\\" Another good heavy track; good lyrics and melody.<br />*\\"Son of Sam.\\" High-tempo song with good guitars and great, wicked lyrics.<br /><br />Overall, this album is pretty good (and contains some awesome bonus tracks, if you get the \\"Fan Club Edition\\"). It has a few good strong metal songs and a few good ballads. Some songs are a little blander, especially when compared to Shinedown's last album (\\"Us and Them,\\" which I still like the best), but is better than their first (\\"Leave a Whisper\\"). I could certainly get used to this album.
B00005RY7X|5.0|So as you may or may not know by now, Andrew W.K. doesn't have the most complex lyrics around, but for his style of music, it doesn't really matter. The only thing you need to think about when listening to him is that \\"It's time to paaaarty!\\". So yes, every song is an anthem about feeling good and partying hard. And it's all done to the music of simple but awesome keyboard melodies, frenzies guitar chords, stadium rock drums and masculine vocals. From the playfulness of the opener \\"It's Time To Party\\", to the blazing opening guitar solo in \\"She Is Beautiful\\", this album is a great summer party album! It's all melodic hard rock with lots of energy and fun, and to me, that beats out a double-meaning political song anyday, even though I'm quite the Liberal, but whatever. Get it, rock out, and, like Andrew W.K. would put it, party till you puke! Thanks for the time, and peace.
B0013J30W2|5.0|The Good Things<br />*A lot of great, smashing, imaginative action scenes and special effects.  They may be outlandish, but they're interwoven effectively into the story (and are not as hyper as the \\"Nightwatch/Daywatch\\" saga).<br />*Loads of really cool guns, cars, bullets, costumes, and settings.  Production design is awesome.<br />*Filming style is great.  It gets a little hyper and shaky, but not overwhelmingly so.  Lots of slow-motion and solid camera work makes it very fluid.<br />*There is some graphic blood and some brutal violence, but it hardly detracts from the story.  It accentuates the action very well.<br />*The story is great and easy to comprehend.  Was worried that they would leave it wide open, but they actually had a good, complete ending.<br />*It's not all serious action.  There are also some good comic moments.<br />*I don't know about anybody else, but didn't expect any of the plot twists towards the end.  They were very effective, believable, and brought the story together very well.  It even made some earlier scenes clearer.<br />*The main character is phenomenal.  He shows a fantastic evolution from a lowlife twerp into an awe-inspiring killing machine.  The narrative really adds to the character as well, and makes us feel for him.<br />* The other characters are allright.  Fox (Angelina Jolie) is fairly well-developed, and has a heck of a mean streak (and she looks awesome!).  Sloan (Morgan Freeman) is...well...Morgan Freeman.<br />*Very strong themes about self-control and standing up for oneself.<br />*Also brought up one or two good moral questions concerning the assasination business.  The story also delves into some emotionally deep stuff (like a father trying to protect his son).<br />*A few interesting visual motifs (loved seeing the guy moving through the broken loom, as if he was caught in a web of fate).<br />*The overall attitude of the film, through the characters, action, and dialogue, is very mean (in a good way).  A few parts even made me want to applaud the main character, for proving that he wasn't going to take any crud from anybody.<br />*Excellent music (loved hearing NIN's \\"Everyday is Exactly the Same\\"; Danny Elfman's score and his song \\"The Little Things\\" are great too).<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*A couple of the action/chase sequences had some shaky camera movements that made it hard to see the action (but it was still mostly comprehensible).<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*The film's attitude has a few moments where it seems to insult the audience (I believe the main character called us pathetic lowlives or something...).  I found it hilarious, but some of you may find it distasteful.<br />*Some parts really are over-the-top or ridiculous (like the idea that targets are selected by the randomly misthreaded threads on a loom...not to mention the idea of curving a bullet's path or flipping cars onto busses...).  Such absurdity can be seen either as stylish and fantastic, or as weird and silly.<br /><br />Take the character, narrative, and attitude of \\"Fight Club,\\" and mix it with the plot structure, themes, and action of the first \\"Matrix,\\" and you would have something like \\"Wanted.\\" It has a good amount of crazy action, but above all, it has a real bad attitude.  This turned out to be a good thing; not only did it make the action seem more intense, but it also made the character stand out more, and introduced some fascinating themes.

B000002LQR|5.0|I know a lot about this album has already been said but I'll go ahead and say that I agree when people say that this is one of the best '90s rock albums, and one of the best rock albums of all time. Every song on \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" is amazing, with lots of great musicianship, singing and songwriting.<br />There's so much energy, funk and fun, this album is always great with every listen. From the amazing basslines of the legendary Flea to the in-the-pocket drumming of Chad Smith, the crooning vocals alongside the sometimes profound but in this case quite often naughty lyrics by the amazing Anthony Keidis and funky lead guitar lines of the awesome John Frusciante. Plus, Blood Sugar Sex Magik contains 17 songs at over 70 minutes, so that'll definitely keep you busy for a while!<br />Basically, this album is an all-time classic and is just about the greatest album ever made by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you wanna get some of the best RHCP around, get this and \\"Californication\\" for starters, and definitely check out the rest of their catalogue. Thanks for the time, and peace.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Just a very solid album that anyone can appreciate, even if you're not a fan of shinedown. It's like Metallicas Black Album, or Nickelbacks All the Right Reasons. They took a big step toward a more mainstream sound, but didn't take it to far to lose the old fans. Good stuff.

B000001G5H|4.0|Apart from the Tudes for Dudes I'm not a big Chopin fan.  These wonderful pieces were revolutionary in their day and remain unsurpassed for the boldness and freshness of their invention, and for their poetry and sheer musical beauty.  Ranging freely over the widest emotional compass, they are nonetheless governed by an iron logic and for almost two centuries have been a touchstone of pianism, both interpretively and technically.  Something like this can be done only once in a civilization and Chopin nailed it.<br /><br />These performances have much to recommend them but are a bit uneven.  The stormy, brooding pieces come off best.  I have never heard Op. 10 No. 9 in F minor better played,  and Op. 25 No. 12 is superb.  But some of the gentler, more poetic studies, such as Op. 25 No. 1, are less successful, though still good.  Part of the problem may be the piano tone, which although clear and lucid is also rather lean and pingy; more richness, body, color, shading, nuance are needed to fully bring out the poetry in these pieces.  Op. 10 No. 2 is taken a bit slow to my taste.  The most physically taxing of all the studies, it mercilessly belabors the weak third, fourth, and fifth fingers of the right hand, and for those who survive to the end there is the additional interpretive challenge of getting precisely the right conciliatory tone in the closing measures.  The shallow keyfall of Pollini's instrument and his slowish tempo make it easier to play, but because he never breaks a sweat it's not as thrilling as it could be.  The playing here is cool, patrician, polished, and controlled.  These are good things, but they sometimes come at the expense of the visceral excitement which these pieces can generate.<br /><br />In sum -- much above average, and in a few cases unsurpassed; well worth having.
B00008AWOG|5.0|Well I actually picked up Still Life on a limb. I only had Ghost Reveries up to this point and for whatever reason it just didn't do too much for me (at the time that is). Now I really appreciate the album. I popped in Still Life and my ears were open to an extremely haunting, yet soothing guitar melody. I gotta say that this album completely floored me with it's brilliance. It's one of those special albums to me that you just don't really expect that much out of and it completely excedes your expectations and it really opened my musical senses up to something I have never experienced before. After listening to this album, I finally saw all the hype and praise that Opeth get. They are truly modern day innovators and I have never heard anything remotely close to what these guys are doing. They can go from the most brutal, insane black/death metal esque sound to a beautiful, haunting, folky, jazzy acoustic melody. And believe me if you haven't heard these guys before, they are definitely one of the most talented and complex bands I have yet to experience. Mikael Akerfeldt truly is a musical genius and in my book he has yet to fail in the least bit. Still Life is my favorite Opeth album, closely followed by Blackwater Park and that's saying something because everything these guys have put out is instant gold. It really is hard to exactly put in words just how diverse and excellent these guys are. As for this album, it is their most \\"balanced\\" I would say. They have all of their signature sounds and elements in here and they have plenty of acoustic portions in every song. The passion and melody in Mikael's voice found here is superb and he is definitely one of the most distinguishable, best sounding singers in this day and age. It's hard to believe that it's the same guy on this record singing over delicate acoustic harmonies and then the next second he sounds like he's gonna rip somebody's throat out. It makes a great mixture of sounds and textures and just  overall variety though.<br /><br />It really is hard to pick out a favorite song on this album. The two tracks that stand out the most though and that caught my attention would be the acoustic tracks- Benighted and Face of Melinda. Both contain folky, intricate acoustic guitar harmonies that even the most accomplished guitar players would have to work at to perfect. Benighted contains somne of Mikael's most breathtaking/ stunning vocals to date and he can nail that high note. It's a very ambiant tune and definitely one of Opeth's finest acoustic tracks ever. Face of Melinda is a classic live staple of theirs and for good reason. It has alot of jazz in it, put don't fret. I'm not a lover of jazz and I never listen to it as I'm sure many of you don't. But it's something about the way Opeth does it that makes it their own and shows off their amazing talent. This is another very ambiant sounding song. Now for the others. The Moor starts off the album with a very dark/ haunting melody which eventually breaks in to a brutal attack with some very harsh vocals. It kind of drops back down to mid-tempo and goes back and forth between electric and acoustic guitars with clean and muffled vocals. One of the best for sure. Godhead's Lament has one of the best choruses on here, although they never really have a true chorus on any of their songs parsay (take some give some). Moonlapse Vertigo and Serenity Painted Death both continue in the same vein as Godhead's as they both go back and forth from heavy to light to slow/ fast guitar over different vocal techniques. And finally the album is ended off with White Cluster which starts off probably heavier than any other track on the album and ends with beautiful acoustic guitars with a crackling sound in the background.<br /><br />This is a must have album for any metal fans. It is so much different than anything out there and it is so beautiful, yet so brutal and haunting. This is Opeth's best and as usual every song is an epic, except for Benighted that is. It's truly a different experience in the metal realm and it shows a innovative, technical band at the top of their career. If possible, I would definitely get the new remastered version which has a hard case almost like a book cover and has a real nice fold booklet and a second disc with Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound for DVD players and a live performance of Face of Melinda, which is amazing. I have not heard the older versions of this album, seeing that I'm still fairly new to these guys, but I can say that the production is supberb and for $15 or cheaper this is probly the way to go. Still Life is a modern day classic to say the least and is truly a musical journey.ghted that is.

B000OT6V00|4.0|I loved this movie; what a complete and total surprise!<br /><br />I am a comic book fan of the highest order: I still get them every Wednesday...I have over 13,000...I defend the artform to anyone who will listen.<br /><br />But somehow, I never \\"got into\\" Hellboy.\\" I knew it was highly regarded. The visuals appeared interesting. But I never took the dive.<br /><br />I bought the DVD, never watched it. I bought the \\"Special Edition\\"; never watched it. I have that disease. Gotta get them just in case they sell out and you can find them anymore...y'know?<br /><br />I just got my Blu-Ray player, and for some strange reason, I picked up \\"Hellboy\\" in my initial batch of a dozen discs.<br /><br />It ended up being the first movie I put in my player. It sort of \\"called\\" to me.<br /><br />Wow. I was hooked from the opening sequence to the bold credits. And not just because the images were razor-sharp and the sound was goose-bump-making perfect.<br /><br />It's because Hellboy, and his dad, and the fish guy, and Jeffrey Tambor and freakin' Guillermo Del Toro all conspired to suck me into this world that I bought hook, line and giant rocky right hand.<br /><br />The action is outstanding, the humor delicious, the special effects supreme. The plot is a tad muddled, but you won't care.<br /><br />The characterizations...the dialogue...just sparkles. I was reminded of those old-fashioned movies...ones where what the characters were saying is just as important as what they are doing.<br /><br />Yes, even if that character is a big, red demon-like dude who saws off his horns.<br /><br />Not only can't I wait to watch this again, but now I'm going to make every effort to check out the sequel in a few weeks, and see it on the REALLY big screen...<br /><br />Man...I STILL can't get over how much I dug this film...!
B000050IE6|5.0|Well I actually picked up Still Life on a limb. I only had Ghost Reveries up to this point and for whatever reason it just didn't do too much for me (at the time that is). Now I really appreciate the album. I popped in Still Life and my ears were open to an extremely haunting, yet soothing guitar melody. I gotta say that this album completely floored me with it's brilliance. It's one of those special albums to me that you just don't really expect that much out of and it completely excedes your expectations and it really opened my musical senses up to something I have never experienced before. After listening to this album, I finally saw all the hype and praise that Opeth get. They are truly modern day innovators and I have never heard anything remotely close to what these guys are doing. They can go from the most brutal, insane black/death metal esque sound to a beautiful, haunting, folky, jazzy acoustic melody. And believe me if you haven't heard these guys before, they are definitely one of the most talented and complex bands I have yet to experience. Mikael Akerfeldt truly is a musical genius and in my book he has yet to fail in the least bit. Still Life is my favorite Opeth album, closely followed by Blackwater Park and that's saying something because everything these guys have put out is instant gold. It really is hard to exactly put in words just how diverse and excellent these guys are. As for this album, it is their most \\"balanced\\" I would say. They have all of their signature sounds and elements in here and they have plenty of acoustic portions in every song. The passion and melody in Mikael's voice found here is superb and he is definitely one of the most distinguishable, best sounding singers in this day and age. It's hard to believe that it's the same guy on this record singing over delicate acoustic harmonies and then the next second he sounds like he's gonna rip somebody's throat out. It makes a great mixture of sounds and textures and just  overall variety though.<br /><br />It really is hard to pick out a favorite song on this album. The two tracks that stand out the most though and that caught my attention would be the acoustic tracks- Benighted and Face of Melinda. Both contain folky, intricate acoustic guitar harmonies that even the most accomplished guitar players would have to work at to perfect. Benighted contains somne of Mikael's most breathtaking/ stunning vocals to date and he can hit that delicate high note. It's a very ambiant tune and definitely one of Opeth's finest acoustic tracks ever. Face of Melinda is a classic live staple of theirs and for good reason. It has alot of jazz in it, put don't fret. I'm not a lover of jazz and I never listen to it as I'm sure many of you don't. But it's something about the way Opeth does it that makes it their own and shows off their amazing talent. This is another very ambiant sounding song. Now for the others. The Moor starts off the album with a very dark/ haunting melody which eventually breaks in to a brutal attack with some very harsh vocals. It kind of drops back down to mid-tempo and goes back and forth between electric and acoustic guitars with clean and muffled vocals. One of the best for sure. Godhead's Lament has one of the best choruses on here, although they never really have a true chorus on any of their songs parsay (take some give some). Moonlapse Vertigo and Serenity Painted Death both continue in the same vein as Godhead's as they both go back and forth from heavy to light to slow/ fast guitar over different vocal techniques. And finally the album is ended off with White Cluster which starts off probably heavier than any other track on the album and ends with beautiful acoustic guitars with a crackling sound in the background.<br /><br />This is a must have album for any metal fans. It is so much different than anything out there and it is so beautiful, yet so brutal and haunting. This is Opeth's best and as usual every song is an epic, exceptfor Benighted that is. It's truly a different experience in the metal realm and it shows a innovative, technical band at the top of their career. If possible, I would definitely get the new remastered version which has a hard case almost like a book cover and has a real nice fold booklet and a second disc with Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound for DVD players and a live performance of Face of Melinda, which is amazing. I have not heard the older versions of this album, seeing that I'm still fairly new to these guys, but I can say that the production is supberb and for $15 or cheaper this is probly the way to go. Still Life is a modern day classic to say the least and is truly a musical journey.at is.

0060775858|4.0|This book has certainly stood the test of time.   My nieces read this book as children and now they are adults.   I like this book.     Although it may seem somewhat simplistic to some adults it is for a young child. As one reviewer commented \\"it put me to sleep\\", isn't that what it is supposed to do? It is a book about going to bed.     To me, it de-mystifies the the things in a child's room that may seem scary to them once the lights are out. If you help the child identify the items in their room, then they are not so frightening in the dark. Of course, this is only my perception.   Haven't so many of us experienced seeing an object in our room as a child, in the dark and it looks like something it's not? Then you turn the light on and discover it is only your teddy bear.
B00005MP58|4.0|First of all, I thought this was a great movie, and was extremely faithful to the book - I even followed along with the book ocassionally to see just how close they were and there were very few times when they did not match up word for word. The movie took a couple of liberties here and there (such as the scenes with Lydia and wickham), but mostly just to add to the movie - it did nothing to take away from it. Until watching this, the only version I had seen was the recent one with Keira Knightley. While I thought that one was decent enough, I felt they changed too much of it. That being said however, I much preferred Keira Knightley's performance of Elizabeth Bennet - it just felt more passionate to me, Jennifer Ehle was too subdued in my opinion - she just didn't have that same spark as the original character in the book and didn't draw me in as much. I realize it's all a matter of character interpretation and personal taste as to which actress you'd prefer - that's just my opinion. Also, while I love Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, and I think he was a great casting choice, there were certain parts in the end that he could have been softer, and less stern - again though, that's just my interpretaion of the character. Overall, this A&E version is excellent, I thought they did a great job casting the male roles and thought they had a much better casting for Lydia Bennet than in the new movie version. This version is certainly less \\"flashy\\" I guess you'd say, than the movie, but I much prefer this version for its faithfulness to the story. I didn't have any problems wiith color or sound either.
0316286850|5.0|Although this book is not the necessarily the best for cosmetic application instruction, the transformations that Kevyn Aucoin created are absolutely amazing and beautiful.   The first time I saw this book, I knew I had to have it.  Anyone who is a big makeup fan should have it.
B00005V1WO|4.0|I'd had this movie for a while, but never got around to watching it. I finally sat down to watch it (just finished it actually) and was somewhat dissapointed and pleased at the same time. There are a lot of things in this movie that I'm sure are not historically accurate (other than the ones that obviously can't be verified), but it's obvious that the director did his research when he was making this movie. The actors are all well chosen, especially Gabriel Byrne.<br /><br />The movie's appeal is that it's horror is more of the psychological aspect than the ghoul & ghost variety. Just like the title, the tale is very gothic and dark, which may not appeal to everyone. Some who are expecting a movie full of shocks and gore will be very dissapointed. There are shocks, but again... they are of the psychological variety.<br /><br />The movie surrounds Percy Byce Shelley, Mary Godwin (who would later marry Shelley), Claire (Mary's step-sister), Lord Byron, & his personal physician Polidori. After a few too many drinks of laudnum (a very potent drug) and a botched seance, the group begins to see various frightening images. As to whether these images are fake or real, the decision is left up to the viewer. The ending is rather interesting, but I won't reveal it here. Unfortunately for us viewers, the film wasn't retouched when they transferred the film so it's very obvious that the film was dubbed directly from a VHS copy of the film. That's a pity, since there's some GORGEOUS imagery in this movie.<br /><br />For the most part I'd recommend this movie to people who are willing to sit through a slow movie for some good payoff. There are some tedious moments to the film, but they're worth watching. I'd recommend renting this first to make sure that you like it. One thing is for sure, though- it's something you should watch twice so you can catch the things you missed the first go round. There's some campyness to the film, but it's all in good fun.

0525476881|5.0|I have not been disappointed by a Printz author yet and this book is no exception. Prodigy Colin is fearful of what happens as he grows out of being a prodigy and enters adulthood where he might just be normal. In his need to matter, he overlooks all the great things that normal life has to offer. The sense of humor throughout the book is intelligent and I laughed aloud a few times. My favorite line: \\"That's who you really like. The people you can think out loud in front of.\\"
B0018AK9RA|4.0|I almost threw this CD across the room when I heard it the first time through my iPod headphones, but after playing it a second time in my car, I had a whole new experience. I like most Judas Priest fans expected this album to be much heavier, but the songs really do get better with each listen. Nostradamus as a whole is more melodic than anything they have done in the past, and though some lyrics are pure cheese, I quite like it. I know people are going to be split in two groups of loving or hating it, but I am somewhere in the middle, maybe leaning towards loving it. Take a listen at least twice in a different setting and then make a judgement.
B000UFAURI|4.0|Having weathered almost 15 years of being his own band, Dave Grohl probably has fans that don't know he was in a little band called [[ASIN:B00006V9A0 Nirvana]] before the Foo Fighters were starting. Yet here he is, and the Foos have gradually become one of the best meat and potatoes rock bands in the USA. Their follow-up to the magnum opus [[ASIN:B0009HLDFU In Your Honor]] finds them in superb form, incorporating the mix of elements from that album with the hard melodic chops from the classic [[ASIN:B000QEIORG The Colour and the Shape]].<br /><br />Some of that can be credited to Gil Norton, who returns to produce. But some if it also has to be credited to maturity. After all, several of the Foos are fathers now. Therefore, you have a certain viewpoint that may not have been present in 1993. The album starts with a thinly veiled political broadside (\\"The Pretender\\") and closes with the sentimental acoustic \\"Home\\" (a lyric from which the album takes its title). Packed between is the usual array of FF goodies, but the surprises are from the heavily harmonzied \\"Summer's End\\" and the instrumental \\"Ballad of The Beaconsfield Miners.\\"<br /><br />If you're really looking for the expected hard rocking pop thrills the Foo's excel at, it's hear in spades. Both \\"The Pretender\\" and \\"Cheer Up Boys\\" (with its infectious \\"stop stop stop\\" chorus). Consistent and solid all the way through, \\"Echoes Silence Passion and Grace\\" offers further proof that the Foo Fighters are a classic band.
0312360266|5.0|When Zoey is Marked, all hopes of fitting in at her suburban high school seem to suddenly vanish. She already feels like a stranger in her own family, and when her religious step-father finds out that Zoey has been Marked to undergo training to become a vampyre, he is convinced that she is evil, and together, he and her mother refuse to accept that Zoey has only two options...learn how to become a vampyre, or die.    Fitting in at her new school, The House of Night, is nearly impossible as well, for the goddess of the night, Nyx, has bestowed special powers upon Zoey, making her the most powerful fledgling in history, and earning her many enemies. But Zoey is not alone. With the help of some newfound friends, her spiritual Cherokee grandmother, and her mentor, she will learn to embrace her talents and take the first step to righting the many sinister happenings at The House of Night.    Marked is riveting and fast paced right from the very start. Zoey's biting wit and easygoing, honest demeanor make Marked an easy read to get sucked in to (no pun intended). While the exposition of the story may seem a bit too hasty, the Casts make up for it in suspense and remarkable character development, in not just Zoey, but every person, friend or foe. The tone of the novel is pitched perfectly, and it includes references to drug, alcohol, and sex without being graphic, but entirely realistic and plausible. The Casts certainly know how to speak teens' language, bringing us a thrilling novel that will make the heart pound, the mind race, and will ultimately capture the imagination.
0446310786|1.0|Must have been the times in which it was first released because this book did nothing for me. I just don't get why people rave about this book. This is one of those rare cases where you should watch the movie and forget the book.

B000QUCNOK|5.0|Words cannot begin to describe how this film left me. I had to watch it twice to be sure, but I have to say it is exhilirating.  This has to be the most bizarre movie I have ever seen. The only one that even comes a bit close is any version of 'Sweeny Todd', simply because of the story line.  The plot has been gone over, so I won't do that again. I will say that everything about the movie was in prime shape. Actors, sets, costumes,story line, music.... it all came together into an amazing, repulsing masterpiece of a wondrous story! This could almost be fitting to be called a modern, adult fairy tale, with how violent the Grimm Brothers stories were.It does have a finishing moral to boot!  I highly recommend this film. This is one that could certainly be up for discussion in classrooms.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Amid the beautiful and verdant English countryside, the tale of Beatrix Potter unfolds.<br />  In the role of the title character, Renee Zellweger is pert, and simply done-up, but perhaps a bit too emphatic at times with the British accent that comes so naturally to her co-stars.<br /> Through Chris Noonan's skillful and enchanting direction, we are privy to Miss Potter's initial meeting with the Warne Brothers at their publishing firm as her now-classic tale of Peter Rabbit is reluctantly launched by them.<br /> The project is handed to the youngest Warne Brother,novice publisher, Norman, played by a sunny and amiable Ewan McGregor(with a strong resemblance to the actual Norman Warne), who in the company of Beatrix' elderly chaperone, Miss Wiggin(Matyelok Gibbs),introduces her to the publishing process.<br /> We see her life at home in a cozy London apartment with her parents, Rupert and Helen (Bill Paterson, and Barbara Flynn). Her father, a lawyer who never really practiced his trade, spends most of his days at a men's club, but who has encouraged his daughter's artistic prowess since her childhood, as he was once an aspiring artist himself.<br /> Her class-conscious mother disapproves of Beatrix' non-conformist lifestyle, but by insisting that the family summer in the Lake District, as is fashionable, ultimately provides her daughter with inspiration for a more desireable lifestyle, and for more fodder for her childrens' stories than she could have imagined.<br /> Miss Potter has tea with Norman's mother(Phyllida Law) and becomes good friends with his sister, Millie (Emily Watson giving a performance with a lot of range, but mostly with strength).<br /> In the meantime, we are treated to flashbacks of Beatrix' childhood, at home, and also in the Lake District where the little girl(Lucy Boynton) and her brother Bertram (Oliver Jenkins) roam about, chase the animals that Beatrix loves and loves to draw, where the caretaker's son William Heelis(Justin McDonald) takes an interest in her drawings and paintings, and she listens to stories about fairy beasts told to her by her nanny, Fiona (Patricia Flannigan). But like many imaginative children who become writers, Beatrix creates her own stories.<br /> Interspersed with this tale of a teller of childrens' tales are moments when the drawings of Peter Rabbit, Jemima Puddleduck, and others of Beatrix Potter's now-world-famous menagerie of friends spring to life before our eyes--delightful moments that illustrate how real these characters were to their creator.<br /> Beatrix' father is more impressed with her literary success than her mother, and Mrs. Potter  reluctantly invites  Norman and Millie to the family's Christmas party. The siblings hold up well amid the Potters' many titled guests, and there is more than one romantic moment between Norman and Beatrix.<br /> Apprehensive about the romance between the two, the Potters coax their daughter to summer with them in the Lake District once again, to see if her feelings will change.Little does Beatrix realize that on this journey, she will be saying farewell to her past and hello to her future.<br /> Tragedy strikes, but just beforehand, she reunites with her former acquaintance, William Heelis, who is now a country solicitor(played with charisma by a tall, clear-eyed, crinkly smiling, photogenic Lloyd Owen, who has delightfully rich coloring).<br /> Ultimately, the childrens' author is compelled to make a life for herself on her own terms at a time when that was rare for women, and along the way, she discovers that someone close to her has the same regard for her watercolor and pen-and-ink pals as she has.<br /> Viewers are treated to a gem of a true story, told with as much vivid imagination as the authoress herself might have had, if not more, and we glean from this sunny triumphant tale, lessons about independance, and of how life goes on after the worst happens.<br /> \\"We must present ourselves to the world!\\" she tells her menagerie at the beginning, \\"and we must think of it as an adventure!\\"<br /> Now the world can share in the adventure of the animal characters and their creator in a film that is destined to become a classic in its own right.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|Nelly Furtado may have been 2006's best new album but singer-songwriter John Mayer comes in 2nd with his album \\"Continuum.\\"  I love the hit single \\"Waiting On The World To Change\\" which should have been a bigger hit.  At least he is having sucess with his hit single \\"Say.\\"  While he may be known right now for dating actress Jennifer Aniston, we often forget that he is a musician first.  In this album Mayer gets right aside other artists and bands like Eric Clapton and Dave Matthews.  This is a fun, laid-back listen.  The single \\"Gravity\\" will have you singing along just like \\"Waiting On The World To Change.\\"  Every song is worth listening.  John Mayer could be hailed as the best male singer right now (Sorry, Justin Timberlake!).  Overall I would definately reccomend his  most recent album \\"Continuum.\\"  I can't wait for another album from him!

0671799320|5.0|Mr. Yergin undoubtedly deserved the Pulitzer Prize for this masterpiece on the history of oil industry. He succeeded in covering about a century and a half of discoveries and developments providing accurate information on historical events, national and international politics and key players, achieving to write a reference book on the subject.  Certainly no author whomsoever can be impartial - and throughout the reading one may well notice that Mr. Yergin is writing from a North-American standpoint. However, partiality is subtile and does not jeopardise his work's strict conformity to facts. Actually, it is only now and then - as in the case of Mossadegh and Nasser - that one might notice that the author could have stepped forward into a less contained critique of Washington's inertia and refrained from a more stark appraisal of Western European role.  Nonetheless, Mr. Yergin is probably the best historian of the subject, faithful to facts, besides being able to imprint a light and entertaining style into his narrative.
B0013J30W2|4.0|Recognizable style, because it's the same russian director who did Nightwatch and Daywatch (and not surprisingly is working on Twlilight Watch :). Timur Bekmambetov that is. So the style is totally his.    Feature is sure fun to watch. Sometimes I felt like watching Bourne Ultimatum: way short of the shots during the action sequence and quick camera moves, but all that synched with the sound create a good impression. Lots of ideas and visual effects are brought over from Daywatch, slow motion, fast camera speed and changing camera speed effects, go-around-angles, free fall camera motion, following the subject in a free fall, following a bullet - all that depicts a great roller coaster where you don't really have time to pay attention to what's really going on. And then when you think, man, I'm totally lost, there will be a pause and normal \\"timeflow\\" where you could get pieces of the plot back together.    Main character acting is great. Actually all the characters are great. Mixed variety. You got Angelina, Freeman and Konstantin Khabensky - actors you would never expect to see together in one feature, but by merging \\"rising talent\\" from ex-USSR block with Hollywood money, you got perfect mix of visually reach and wonderful performance.   There are portions of the movie where guy speaks russian, but there are no subtitles, even though he says and sings funny lines. That would be fun for someone who speaks or learns the language.     Enjoy!    --  V.

EVERY SINGLE SONG ON THIS ALBUM IS EXQUISITE BUT THE MASTERSTROKE IS \\"SAILING ROUND THE ROOM\\" IT IS SIMPLY THE BEST WORK EMMYLOU HAS EVER RECORDERD ALONG WITH KATE AND ANNA SINGING BACKGROUND VOCALS THIS SONG IS A TREASURE...WHAT MAKES THIS LP REAL SPECIAL IS THAT IT IS TOTALLY OUT OF STEP WITH THE PURE GARBAGE OF TODAY'S MUSIC...EMMYLOU IS A GENUIS WHO HAS GROWN WITH EACH ALBUM SHE RECORDS
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I'll be honest, I liked this series quite a bit because I tried to find things in common with my mom as a teenager and into adulthood.  Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica-Parker are amazingly hot, and really the storytelling is decent as well.  Plus, I got to spend quality time with my most awesome parent.  :)    All I know is that I've never received an answering machine message that started with my mom yelling happily, so I'd like to thank amazon for that.  It is even better than a pair of birkenstocks, and if you ask my mom, that's tough to beat.
0525950079|3.0|WWE has basically the same plot as POTE.  Some obvious similarities:<br />Jack-Merthin<br />Lady Aliena-Philippa<br />William Hamleigh-Ralph Fitzgerald<br />The list goes on.  This book is repetitous and has the same pattern as POTE, good versus evil with a lot of architectural jargon thrown in.  I loved Pillars abut soon tired of WWE.  Follett is a gifted writer.  He deserves to write a book about a subject that fascinates him.  It was just too much for this reader.
B0013J30W2|4.0|Leave reality at the station and prepare for a rollercoaster ride of ultraviolet, non-stop action.  An ordinary, cubicle-dwelling office worker (James McAvoy) is recruited into an ancient clan of assassins known as the Fraternity.  One of the assassins is super cool, super sexy Angelina Jolie.  The clan is controlled by suave Morgan Freeman.  Full of twists and turns, this bloody thriller is sure to please all fans of action movies.  Best scene:  The derailment of a crowded passenger train from a bridge high above a deep ravine.<br /><br />  \\"Wanted\\" reminded me of \\"Point of No Return,\\" starring Bridget Fonda as a drug-addicted criminal who is unwillingly recruited into a government assassination organization.  Both McAvoy and Fonda's characters are depicted as \\"losers;\\" they are not comfortable with assassinating strangers and want out of their organizations.<br /><br />  All the lead actors of \\"Wanted\\" gave excellent performances.  The plot was very intricate, though some of the special effects were unrealistic.  Excess profanity and sexual lewdness were distracting; if they had been toned down, I would've given this movie five stars.  As it is, it is very deserving of four.
1883217040|5.0|This is a MUST have for any jazz musician.  Now, let me just warn you that if you don't play piano you might not enjoy the book as much considering a lot of the things written in the book by Levine are really being directed towards piano.  There are also many jazz piano standard sample pieces that you will find through out the book.  That being said though, Levine makes his points more than clear and explains the theory in a way that you will totally understand.  If you read carefully and pay attention to what he wrote, you will without question become a better jazz musician.  I hope this review has helped you, please feel free to leave comments!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Since many of the reviews here have more words in them than the actual movie, I'll keep this short.<br /><br />From a purely technical perspective, WALL-E deftly weaves together a future-looking tale about post-consumerism-trashed Earth, emotional intelligence in robots, and the rule of the evil corporation in keeping us fat and ignorant.<br /><br />However, that's the technical part - the non-technical part is that the adorable WALL-E is yet another in the long line of Ugly Duckling's in Disney/Pixar's past who reminds us yet again that love can come in any form, and even from a beaten-up but spunky little trash-collecting robot.<br /><br />It is worth noting that if you need things to constantly be exploding and tons of trite dialogue and \\"I saw that coming from Mars\\" plots/cliches, this movie might be challenging to sit through because it requires empathy and attention to non-verbal/non-exploding details and emotions that are expressed/implied, not spoken or blown up.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyable, can't wait for the Blu-Ray release.
0374105235|4.0|This is a compelling true story. A boy named Ishmael leaves his comfortable life in an African village to attend a rap music event with his brother and a few friends.  While he is gone, rebel forces attack his village destroying his home and family life.  He, his brother, Junior, and his friends then wander the countryside of Sierra Leone trying to survive and avoid both the rebel and government troops.  Identifying the enemy is difficult in a country rich in resources and awash with government corruption.  Ishmael is separated from his group and eventually attaches himself to another group of teenage boys all under 16.  Eventually, the war catches up with him and he and his little band are conscripted into the government troops.  For the next two or more years and armed with an AK 47 and RPG's, he kills, maims, and robs in the name of the government.  These boy soldiers take many drugs to dull their feelings and allow themselves to participate in the inhumane slaughter.  Finally, aid workers either buy the boys' freedom or settle with their army leader and obtain their release.  They are taken into the custody of rehabilitation counselors where they are given an opportunity for redemption.  Ishmael clearly a natural leader is selected to travel to New York to attend a U.N. conference on child soldiers.  While there he  makes many friends.  I understand that he was taken in by one of them and that he subsequently attended Oberlin college.    I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5, because it drags a bit during the years of army participation and killing. Further, Ishmael's parents are divorced, but he lives with his father.  His family is Muslim and that may be why the father retained custody.  Very telling in the book was a description on pg. 77 (hardback) of his formal naming ceremony.  A huge feast is prepared.  First the elders eat their fill, then the men, then the boys and lastly the women and children.  I presume that if there isn't enough to share, the womenand children starve. I don't know if the author realized what he revealed about his culture by this telling description.  However, we never learn the basis of the divorce or why his father retained custody.  Living conditions were somewhat primative.  The houses were made of concrete brick or mud and they had tin roofs which were particularly noisy when it rained.  Their diet was complete though not luxurious, and they were not hungry.  However, they walked for miles to save bus fare and did not have electricity or telephones in their homes. Sierra leone sounds like a terrible place.  The film, Blood Diamond, was about a similar subject.    I really don't know if there is a solution when countrymen kill one another over money, resources, and power.  However, perhaps, this book and the film, Blood diamond, will be the stimulus for a resolution.     This book was worth reading, and I recommend it.
B000YABIQ6|3.0|Series was great, 5 stars!<br />3 stars for the DVD only.<br />Disapointed with most of the DVD Commentaries. Most are 2 or 3 cast or staff commentaries pieced together into one commentary which makes some of them VERY boring. VERY borng! There are a few good ones when two people are actullay doing the commentary together at the same time.<br />Not too many other special features other than the commentaries.
0670020745|4.0|Jill Bolte Taylor has given us both an intriguing and helpful look inside the brain.  As Jill explains her stroke, the reader gains a more complete knowledge of hemisphericity juxtaposed with the need for the whole brain all the time.  She explains why the brain is \\"hard-wired for spirituality\\" and gives hope for those with brain injury.  Well done!
B0000DJZ8R|1.0|Poor quality disc's. These cheap classic's are made on cheap DVD disc's and have defects from the manufactures process. I have returned two of them so far and and am hoping this is a fluke and not the 'norm'.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game is fun for adults because it is a strategy game. But it is also fun for kids because of the pretty colored tiles and the challenge of trying to find a place spacially to put a tile. You can only put your tile down where it touches a corner of one of your previous tiles. You can not touch your own tiles edge to edge. My son just turned six years old and he's getting pretty good at the game. He doesn't yet understand how to block another player but that will come with time.
B0013D8LOK|1.0|I was totally disapointed after the hype over this movie I thought it was total trash. At no stage did anyone tell me this was a musical and if I had that info I would not have brought it. I am a firm fan of Johnny Depps work but this movie has driven me past my limit. The only musical I like is THE SOUND OF MUSIC and I don't think the Von Trapp family cut anyones throut. Tim Burton you suck.
0316143472|5.0|I enjoyed this book far more than \\"Dress Your Family...\\".  The stories were fresh and exemplative of this fine writer as he relates his bits of realism with both humor and emmotion.  David Sedaris has made me laugh and cry.  I am already looking forward to his next book!  Until then I will re-read the others!
B00132D808|1.0|Albums like this are why people download illegally.  What is played on the radio is tantamount to false advertising.  Shame on me for not listening to the sample clips, but it was purchased as a gift...  Very disappointing.
B000RPTQ1C|3.0|I really love Coldplay´s work, but i have to say that this Album is a bit overproduced in a way. Where are all the simple and adictive melodies that the first two albums offered? The guitars? It´s like it is Chris Martin and the producers album, not Coldplay´s. I´m sure some people apreciate the turn to a more electronic sound and the big sound of the orchestra, but I miss the simpleness of songs like Yellow, Spies and the Scientist. Favourite tracks though are \\"Yes\\", \\"Violet Hill\\" and \\"Lovers in Japan\\"
0061537934|5.0|I have never left a review on a book but I have read quite a bit.  I just finished \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" and had to say how much I loved this book.  This was a well written book with a great story.  My only advice, don't read this book when you are away from your dog, I read it while I was out of town for work, I may not have cried as much if I was at home with her.
B001B93PQ0|5.0|I purchased this CD only knowing a few of John Mayer's songs.  This album is filled with amazing songs and the best guitar playing I have heard in years.  It is very refreshing to hear an artist that actually has talent.  The fact that it is live only makes it ten times better, the music is almost better sounding than the studio recordings on his other albums.      Personal favorite on the album: Out Of My Mind! great blues riffs and great lyrics    This album worth the money!
B0010358D0|4.0|A very good new story for the appleseed series. Is good (not excelent) in all the film aspects, but it worth every penny.
B00005JM0B|3.0|\\"T3 - Rise of The Machines\\" is a decent entry in the big, dumb action (BDA) movie genre. Nick Stahl adds depth to the role of John Connor - future leader of the resistance and Claire Daines is pretty good as his love interest Catherine Brewster but Governor Schwartzenegger's acting has not improved - even playing a robot (the \\"good\\" termininator) - and Kristina Loken makes a memorable if rather one-note \\"bad\\" terminator. The film has all the stunning special effects and spectacular stunts you would expect in a BDA but the main problem the film can never quite overcome is an overall air of familiarity.
B000NA2BEU|4.0|I found this final season of the Veronica Mars series to be highly entertaining.  The package and DVDs arrived in excellent condition and the shows both touched and amused me.  It was awesome to watch the special features disk and see the 4th season that never came to pass, as well as a gag reel and interviews from the actors and crew.  This series should have been able to stay on the air - fortunately, thanks to DVDs, we can watch them whenever we like.
0307388840|4.0|I have read many of Ian McEwan's books, and enjoyed them all. Amsterdam and Saturday are both riveting character studies. However, I was a bit disappointed in Atonement the book, although I truly enjoyed Atonement the movie. For instance, not much happens in the beginning of Atonement, which opens with a long description of a wealthy English home. But in the movie we see all of the things that are described in such detail in the book. Once the story gets started, though, the tale is even more moving than Amsterdam or Saturday. I do recommend Atonement, especially for readers who enjoy books that bring to life the atmosphere of a period.
B000N0WCLC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie alot but it seems that they picked a nice safe topic to rant about.  Diamonds?  I suppose that they are being used to fund those various brush wars in Africa.  I did like how they also brought up the topic of child soldiers.    What I didn't like was how they seemed to blame the west for much of the strife in Africa.  We buy the diamonds.  We arm them (never mind the AK's).  Etc.  Yet at some point, don't they have to take responsibility for their future?
6305428220|4.0|The movie was insane.  even though it was made in 1998, the grafix were very much believable.  along with all the stars in the movie.
B000TGCR4C|5.0|I thought this was a pretty good movie.  I wont go into a plot synopsis as many of the other reviewers here did that.  The pacing at the beginning of the movie seemed to move a little slow but it picked up as the movie went along.  Towards the end of the movie, I couldn't stop watching it as I was curious what was going to happen next.    One of the things I did like about this movie was how it portrayed some of the Dutch as collaborating with the Nazis.  It's pretty rare to see that in a movie.  IT is even rarer to see what happens to the those folks after the liberation.
0446693804|2.0|I'm really not sure what all the buzz is over this story. I read it with high expectations, thinking it will be a very powerful and moving story. What I got was a predictable story line and no deep character development.     I was hoping for my heart strings to be pulled and tears to pour out, but instead I just put the book down and went to cook my dinner without so mcuh as thinking about the story.     There is nothing unique about this story, there are countless other stories like this but somehow with stronger character development where they will linger and stay with you long after you put the book down. As it is, my sentiment is more along the lines of \\"Jamie who?\\"
0385340567|5.0|The latest in the Jack Reacher Series.  It keeps your interest with every page.  Some people I know have complained about it being hard to follow but I did not find it difficult.  If you like Jack Reacher you will like this book.
B000ZN802W|4.0|I may have liked this movie for different reasons than some of the other reviewers. I didn't necessarily find it inspiring or particularly beautiful, but I did think it was very intelligent, thought provoking, consistent, and well directed/acted. It's basically a film about independence and freedom, and how those can be terrible, isolating things when taken to the extreme. For those who thought the minor characters were too distracting, try to think about them in that context.     It's almost like the minor characters are there to warn the main character that even though living your own life is great, a lack of human interaction makes that freedom painful. These are lessons he fails to realize at every turn, whomever he meets, (instead he feels like he is there to enlighten them) and this selfish interpretation of independence is his tragedy.     Think about why he dies: not only has he tried to do everything himself, which is a mistake on this kind of trip, (again, there were warning signs, like he should have figured this out when the moose killing thing went bad) but he's either so devoted to his dream or so frightened to go back and face the family he's running away from that there is nowhere to run to anymore. I guess living by independence means dying by it.    There's a key scene in the middle, where he goes to the homeless shelter in LA, then sees himself getting sucked into the upper middle class hypocrisy he hates. Even though this is irrational -- if he can strike out on his own with a backpack, he can also do so in a more socially integrated way  -- he turns away from going back to his old name. He does realize eventually that it was a mistake, but like all tragic figures, it is only after it is too late to change anything.     I think most people knew a guy like this in college, the upper middle class \\"rebel\\" who could have done anything and then took to the road after graduation, but eventually came back to sell out and work on wall street. maybe that's why this book was so popular -- because this guy took it to the extreme and he died, thus reinforcing others' decisions to rebel a little, but then run back home to mommy and daddy. Put in that way, the people who like the book and film for these reasons don't come across so well.    Truly a provocative and interesting film -- those are just my thoughts, but I think you should see it and decide for yourself.
0307383415|5.0|I would not have had any intention of reading this book or any by Barack Obama as I viewed him with both distaste and a bit of fear feeding into the slanderous campaign being run against him and being a die-hard Republican.  So why did I read this book?  Well my boss has his Kindle on a business trip and knowing I wanted a Kindle he lent me his to read one night.  He had this book in his Kindle, so out of curiousity I started to read it.  I can honestly say I was blown away and determined to read the rest of the book. I wanted to know more.    I finally purchased my Kindle(love it)and as soon as it came yesterday I ordered this book first and have been reading it since.  My opinion has pretty much reversed on what I thought about this man, and I can say I am impressed and want to know more.  I am not quite done with the book but decided to write this as a possible encouragement to someone who like me thinks ill of this man.  Am I a total convert, not yet, but I will now listen more closely as to what he is saying and think long and hard about what to do in November.  And those e-mails that were pure poison, I'll just delete them unread and make my own decision.
B000UFAURI|5.0|It amazes me how many people think that this band has had weak offerings in recent years.  The Foo Fighters' previous offerings in the 2000's--2002's \\"One By One\\" and 2005's \\"In Your Honor\\" to me just further strengthened this band's amazing discography.  Well, for certain, this 2007 offering continues to add to the Foo legacy, cementing this band's place as the most consistent mainstream rock band of the \\"post-grunge\\" era.    How catchy is the lead track \\"The Pretender\\"?  At least one reviewer compared it to 1997's \\"Monkey Wrench\\" as an incredibly accessible single, and I would agree.  Subdued verses followed by explosive choruses, a Foo trademark, make this track an absolute winner.  \\"Let it Die\\" starts slow and builds, to the point that Dave Grohl is screaming by the end of the track.  \\"Erase/Replace\\" continues the early hard rock vein of the album.  Then comes \\"Long Road to Ruin\\"--what a modern melodic masterpiece and true highlight of the album.  \\"Come Alive\\" is a typical heavy Foo anthem--somewhat similar to \\"Come Back\\" on the \\"One By One\\" album but not as lengthy.    At this point, the album mellows out a bit more overall but continues to be utterly brilliant for the most part.  How simple yet good is \\"Stranger Things Have Happened\\" with the acoustic guitar strumming leading the way?  \\"Summer's End\\" is another modern melodic masterpiece with stunning melodies.  \\"Home\\" is a surprisingly mellow piano ballad to end the album but to me (unlike others) is not boring--just another unique way for Dave Grohl to express himself musically.  There are still rockers in the second half of the album as well--such as the amusingly-titled \\"Cheer Up Boys (Your Make Up is Running)\\" and the stronger anthemic \\"But Honestly\\"--another track that builds momemtum as it goes along.    Last time out with \\"In Your Honor\\", the Foos decided to divide up their sound variety into two disks--a \\"fast\\" one and a \\"slow\\" one.  This time they decided to meld it all together into one cohesive masterpiece.  For sure, they have succeeded in my book.  Once again, the variety of sounds, tempos, and volumes of music on this album have made for an exciting and interesting rock album.    This band has proven to me once again that they can do little wrong.  Strongly recommended for rock fans dating back to the '70s (like me) not to mention youngsters who just caught onto rock in the '90s.  Many Nirvana fans (from where Dave of course originally came from) love this band, which makes sense.  I, on the other hand, loved the guitar-based '70s rock and '80s melodic rock and was originally put off when \\"grunge\\" replaced my '80s guitar heros.  None of that matters here.  This band, and for sure this album, should appeal to most rock music fans of the past 30 years.
B0010X745K|4.0|The thing about the mist is it creeps up on you, kinda like the way the beasties do in this movie. One minute your thinking your watching an average modern day homage to 50s b movies and then bang! it hits you, what your actually watching is a masterful execution of storytelling with just the right amount of terror to keep the toes curled. Frank darabonts excellent adaptation of one of stephen kings lesser known novellas is full of great ideas and with a necessary first half of the movie given over more to character development rather than needless gore and empty shocks, this in turn leads to a far more satisfying second and third acts when you actually care about their plight, this is the key to a great movie, especially in this genre. Thomas jane heads a cast of great character actors as a simple trip to the supermarket turns into a siege when a huge mist descends upon the town full of other worldly creature's. Its a simple tale of 'who's the worst animal' the creature's outside or the ones trapped inside? but it's told with such glee and abandonment that you can't help but be absorbed into king's rather eerie world. The beasts themselves are a mix bag of lovecraftean giants and mutated insects and the mist itself adds to there mystery although this was probably more for budgetary reasons than for effect, but it's hard not to feel a bit let down that the bigger ones don't get more screen time, however the scene in the pharmacy with some terrifying arachnid types more than compensates. This is a rare horror movie, one that invests time and energy into it's inhabitants and is all the better for it, after all it's the ending that has had more criticism than anything else and that was for being so morbid and sad, but if this was a standard stalk and slash gorefest would anyone really care? i doubt it. see it.
B0012Q732O|1.0|Hahaha..Roland Emmerich should be put in jail...this guy is incredible..<br /><br />I still cannot understand how these cavemen where in touch with civilizations so advanced that where riding contemporanean horses or building pyramids.  Perhaps in the same Universe where Aliens with such advanced technology are defeated thanks to a computer virus or where a huge and I mean huge lizard is able to hide in sewers...<br /><br />This is art...<br /><br />10.000 BC (Before Chopping my wrists with a spoon...)
B000P12LWY|5.0|Would want everyone that loves classics to have The Tudors in their collects. I am waiting to buy season two.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have been using this DVD for about a month now.  I am absolutely amazed.  I have gained so much muscle I can't believe it.  My abs are so much stronger and defined now. I have advanced to level two and will probably stay there a while.  Level two is rough but the feeling afterwards outweighs all the hard work during the workout.   The music is a little too rocky for me but I try to block it out because it is such a great workout.  I wish she didn't use the language that she uses sometimes.  I know she is a tough trainer but the language doesn't have to be.  Overall I am well pleased with the results. Amazing that you can get such results in just a 20-minute workout!  Thanks Jillian!
B000MCIBE8|1.0|I'm a huge Doors fan.  I lost the original CD I bought.  It was the original mix and sounded great.  Now they remixed it!!!  In the song Break on Through, Jim doesn't sing just \\"She gets, she gets, she gets........high\\".  Now they inserted the \\"high\\" for each \\"she gets\\".  This is artistically wrong.  The current crew who remixed this did not see that.  Are they crazy!!!  Leave good enough alone, please!!!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this DVD after reading the reviews and it did not disappoint. It's a great workout in 20 to 30 minutes but you have to be careful about not injurying your knees and hips and back. I found it very helpful to do some yoga or pilates afterwards to really stretch me out and strengthen my back. If you do that you should have minimal pain the next day.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|The latest animated film from Pixar is cute and cuddly, but unfortunately the story is touching but not revolutionary. The most fascinating thing about Wall-E is that hardly anyone utters a word for the first hour or so of the movie. And yet, it's better that way - pictures speak louder than words, and Pixar's fantastic animation yells out to us in a way that no one else can. Yet, as a follow up to Ratatouille, I couldn't help but be disappointed by the limited scope of the story of Wall-E. It's a shame that Pixar chose to play it safe and focus on  the touchy-feely aspect of the story instead of truly exploring armageddon and teaching kids (and adults too!) about recycling, sustainability, and taking care of the Earth.
1847670911|5.0|When I first heard the name Obama, I thought where did he come from, and I did not take him too seriously at first.  I do not know if it is proper to mention politics here, but I am a staunch Democrat.  Now, I have friends and relatives who are just as stauch Republicans, and that does not matter the least bit to me.  I am just so thankful that we live in a country where we can vote according to the dictates of our own hearts and minds.  Leaving that thought, I voted for Hillary in the primary and believed she would get the nomination.  Well, the rest is history.  After a few weeks, I soon realized with the coverage on the medica that Obama was not going away any time soon.  Therefore, I went to Amazon to see what I could get to learn who he is.  I bought this book and the Audacity of Hope from Amazon.  I was amazed at how well written and interesting this book is by such a young man.  He is so diversified in various cultures, and has a deep understanding of human nature with regard to expressing themselves in these cultures.  He speaks of the difficulty of his youth with living in a white family while his grandfather taking him to the black bars for entertainment.  He lives in Indonesia, and one gets an incite to the Asian customs which are quite different from us as Americans.    He later goes to Kenya and gives us detail into the people and customs of that land.  The struggles that face his people whom he has not known.  He only saw his father once when he was ten years old.  But the way he meets his siter Auma after they are both grown, and yet he connects with her is amazing.    It appears to me that he is trying to be truthful and candid about such important matters.  He gives us an insight into the deep feelings of people who are affected by proverty and race.  It would be unkind of me to say I understand those feelings because as a white American, I have not experienced them.  However, I have great empathy for those who must endure this life.  Yet, I am seeing that today we have many white people who are living in the area of poverty and uneducated.  I am now old and see a trend that I do not like.  Obama chose willingly to serve in the Chicago area where he could see firsthand the poverty and see if he could make change.  He did.  He was persevering, tolerant, patient, a man on  a mission to accomplish, and he did with much success.      Yes, this book answered my question as to who is he.  I will be voting for him, and after reading this book, it is with great confidence I do so.  I have not begun the Audacity of Hope yet but am looking forward to it if it is written with the same honesty and thought.  I highly recommend.
B0002S947K|4.0|I bought this album based on the strength of just one song...I was so happily suprised to find the entire album was great. There are not a lot of albums I enjoy listening to start to finish; When I find one I put it on my \\"desert island\\" short list--this album made it there right away. The songs are simple, well crafted and beautiful. LaMontagne's voice is gorgeous and can run from mournful to joyful in three songs. He cites both Otis Redding and CSNY as influences and both are apparent on different tracks without the artist ever once sounding unoriginal. Loved it. I took away one star for one reason only, and maybe its an unfair one--the album is extremely mellow almost entirely, which means there may be certain times and or places that its just not the one you reach for.
B0016OOM7Q|5.0|I really love this CD- it's full of energy- with the exception of 3 songs, the rest of the CD is highly addictive.  This is one of her best- it blows Confessions away. I hope she releases more like this in the future.
0060512806|5.0|I LOVED this book.  But, for potential readers, I have a VERY large caveat: Unless you have a love of mathematics and/or cryptanalysis you're going to miss out on much that made the book, for me, so great.  In fact, judging from the one and two star reviews so prevalent here, you more than likely are going to hate it and end up torching it in your back yard in frustration and dancing around the ashes.  By way of anecdote, I was talking to one of my neighbours who happens to have a degree in mechanical engineering while we were out walking our dogs about a certain aspect of the book that had me puzzled for a bit, and another neighbour stopped to join us. After listening for a time, she looked at me and asked, in a semi-sarcastic, baffled tone, \\"Are you reading an Engineering textbook for fun?\\"  When I told her it was a novel, she became even more nonplussed.  So, the point here is, you've been warned.  I happen to be an English Literature major, but I was one of those kids in school who in, say, trigonometry class just looked at a math problem, knew the answer and handed in my tests in five minutes.  The words, \\"SHOW WORK\\" are scorched into my memory of adolescence.  On the other hand, if you've liked Stephenson's other works, or like picaresque literary jaunts in general, you will no doubt like this one as well.  You'll just have to skip the parts I found most fascinating.<br /><br />I can now say, though, that I understand why Stephenson fans took him to task for lack of verisimilitude in Snow Crash and the books which constitute  The Baroque Cycle, both of which are a great deal of fun to read, but not terribly conducive to deep thinking. This book is so conducive, for a number of reasons, but the primary one, I should say, is that very few people realise just how WEIRD the branch of mathematics known as Statistics is. The simplest example I can think of is coin tossing:  If you enter a (rather primitive) casino, toss a coin once and come up heads, your chance on the second toss of coming up heads again is 25%.  It's not 50%.  Furthermore, if you toss the coin and it comes up heads, then put the coin in your pocket and wait three days, three months, three years, however long, and take that same coin out of your pocket on the other side of the globe and flip it, your chances of coming up heads, after all this time, are still 25%, not 50%.  I've gone out about the Math enough for this review, but the Math herein is very much concerned with probabilities like this one.  It makes you start thinking, as the character Waterhouse does at one point, of the entire world as a giant probability wave.  I can't tell you how many hours of sleep I lost tossing and turning with different numbers running through my head.<br /><br />The characters in this book, as Stephenson puts it are \\"people too busy leading their lives to worry about extending their life expectancy.\\"  This makes for very intriguing, if involved, reading.  But the writing can also approach the poetic at times.  The sinking of the Arizona at Pearl Harbor is described thusly: \\"A military lyre of burnished steel that sings a thousand men to their resting places at the bottom of the harbor.\\"<br /><br />And the book is so terribly funny.  The Englishman, Chatan's, description to Detachment 2702 of the importance of knowing the right way to, er, blow your head off if in danger of being caught by the enemy is priceless, \\"You would be astonished at how many otherwise competent chaps botch this apparently simple procedure.\\"<br /><br />Also, as noted by other reviewers, there are numerous in-jokes, my personal favourite being the Latin motto for the Societas Eruditorum: \\"Ignoti et quasi occulti.\\" Which Enoch Root translates for Bob Shaftoe as, \\"Hidden and unknown-more or less,\\" which is EXACTLY what it means!  Notice the quotation marks surrounding more or less.  The word \\"quasi,\\" in Latin means \\"more or less\\" or \\"as it were\\" or \\"so to speak\\".<br /><br />Alright, I've gone on long enough, perhaps too long, for an Amazon review.  For those few who might be interested, I'll try to include a simple program I came up with for solving the Turing bicycle problem, which Stephen uses to illustrate how the Enigma machine works in the Comment section once this review is posted.<br /><br />A wonderful book!review.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I have been an avid fan of Coldplay from the start and I must say that have still yet to disappoint. Usually my favorite parts of their songs are the strong instumental parts with no lyrics. You just flow with the music. This album is totally different from all their others, it starts out with Life in Technicolor, a completely instrumental track. It starts the album off great. While there aren't a lot of songs a lot of the songs have two sets of the same song, but still completely different. Of course, the old Coldplay is still there with Viva la Vida and Violent Hill. IF you've ever enjoyed Coldplay, believe me this album will not disappoint.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|Not at all historically accurate but beautiful sets, beautiful clothing and wonderfully talent actors made this movie fun to watch.

B000069HKH|5.0|By far Springsteen's best work since Nebraska.  A haunting collection of songs reflecting the horror of 9/11.  Most recommended songs are \\"Nothing Man\\" with the poignant line \\"How my brave life young life was forever changed in a cloud of pink vapor\\" which evokes past horrifying descriptions of falling bodies hitting the streets below the WTC, and the title cut. IMHO-this album is the single most important recording of this decade.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|Slipknot is one of the better Metal Bands I enjoy. They scream a lot, but it sounds different than your typical Metal Band. There is a certain tone to the lead singer's voice that is great to listen to. Slipknot also has some softer vocals that work very well.    This CD is mostly a huge Metal CD. If you love this type of music, like me, then you will love this. You get your normal lyrics about hate, killing, and loneliness. While most tracks are fairly good, others are pretty meh. I feel like the addition of Slipknot's lighter non-screaming songs really made this one worthwhile. This CD can be good to listen to no matter what mood you're in at the time.

B000069CWE|2.0|I am actually one of those people who enjoy Linkin Park's music. I feel that their combination of nu-metal and rap works fairly well and has lead them to some great music. This, however, is a disgrace to anyone who enjoyed their music.    The CD consists of their [[ASIN:B00004Z459 Hybrid Theory]] CD remixed with a few other tracks. The remixes are mostly horrible and are very annoying. They basically just took Hybrid Theory and turned it into a badly made Rap album. The new tracks aren't good either and I'd honestly consider them some of the worst of the disk.    The few positives are that some of the songs like Crawling actually turned out very good. This CD lacks enough of these good songs to actually make this worth purchasing. Check out their new CD, [[ASIN:B000OCXMAE Minutes to Midnight]], if you want to hear real Linkin Park.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I work a lot.  Work often interferes with my ability to get to the gym consistently.  Therefore, I began looking for workouts that I could do at home to supplement and up my exercise to 3-5 times a week.  This is a great workout.  It is interval training with weights and ab work.  Jillian is straight forward, no nonsense, but totally encouraging.  The cardio portion is simple moves that most people would be familiar with.  Just when you think you're dying, you move to the weight lifting/strength portion which is also no joke.  Again, before you're ready to surrender, you switch to ab work and you do three circuits of this.  I do step aerobics and zumba (both 45-50 minutes).  I sweat as much, if not more, doing this workout as doing those.  Even after the workout was over, I was still sweating tremendously.  I was wiped, but I felt good  physically and proud of myself.  There are three different level routines.  I chose level 1, beginner even though I do step and zumba. I was sore for two days after this.  I will likely remain at the beginner level for a while.  The workout is more challenging than my other workouts because of the combination of weights and aerobics.  At this pace, I have no doubt that I will shred a considerable amount of weight in 30 days.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Gorillaz is a very different type of band. They are represented by cartoon characters and you will hardly ever see their faces. That's not all that is different. The Main Stream is not used to hearing music like this. The music is generally a softer music that you would listen to while relaxing. There are soothing tones an they generally talk about completely random things. This is music without meaning, and I love it.    Songs like Feel Good Inc. are based more of Rap, but most of their songs are just melodies or stories about a town being taken over. If I could describe their music I would say it's Dr. Seuss turned into music. It's very enjoyable to listen to and will be one of your favorite albums if you like to relax.

B0016MJ6HY|4.0|Kar Wai Wong is as much a visual artist as a film director and his fort&eacute; has always been making beautiful, multileveled images on a screen that is trying to see clearly the outlines of character development.  Such is the case in his first English language film MY BLUEBERRY NIGHTS, a creation he wrote (with Lawrence Block) as well as directed.  While the 'story' boasts a cast of fine actors, the emphasis seems less on character delineation than on creating a cinematic stream of consciousness.<br /><br />A New York Russian bakery/caf&eacute; is operated by immigrant Jeremy (Jude Law) and into this milieu comes the newly jilted Elizabeth (Norah Jones - who also provides much of he sound track singing for the film).  She leaves her boyfriend's keys with Jeremy as a sign of resignation but continues to nightly check to see if her ex-boyfriend has shown up to claim them. This is the premise for the formation of a bond between Jeremy and Elizabeth, but without solidifying that bond, Elizabeth runs off to greener pastures.  She settles in Tennessee where she finds work as both a waitress and a bar maid and meets the down and out alcoholic policeman Arlo (David Strathairn) who pines away for his tacky, gallivanting wife Sue Lynne (Rachel Weisz).  Leaving that story piece unresolved, Elizabeth then moves to Las Vegas where she becomes friends with a young, loser gambler Leslie (Natalie Portman) who manages to waste Elizabeth's savings for a car on yet another misjudged gambling night.  Through this cavalcade of losers Elizabeth continues to write postcards to Jeremy and the ending is blatantly predictable.<br /><br />There are some moments of memorable dialog: 'Sometimes, even if you have the keys those doors still can't be opened. Can they? '  'Even if the door is open, the person you're looking for may not be there'.  But for the most part this is a visual feast for those who love Kar Wai Wong's genre.  The plot is thin as is the dialogue and the actors work to make the most of the outlines of conversation that they embellish with their own spontaneous words.  If it feels improvised to the viewer then the viewer has entered the realm of Kar Wai Wong.  This is a film for art film lovers - it is very beautiful to watch!

B000WGWQG8|5.0|This series is one of the best things I have ever seen on TV. It brought that very important history alive and it made me appreciate the great contribution of John Adams to our history. He was indeed a great man. The acting was first-rate and the settings were magnificent. I have been thoroughly delighted. The special features were very interesting also.It would be wonderful if more similar movies could be done on America's history.

0452289963|5.0|after reading this book, i am now aware when i speak and present myself to others. many people do not realize but during the course of a day, when we speak and present ourselves without thinking, the results actually bring people down instead of lifting people up. we speak negatively instead of positively. we try to get ahead of people thinking this will get us ahead in life when in reality, we get ahead by just working with effort and with an inner purpose. most people do not even know they are impacting others negatively. there IS a different way to live which does result in joyous living. A NEW EARTH presents in chapter 1 why the change is necessary. chapters 2,3,4 really show us how we should NOT be treating others, by using our (egos). chapters 5,6 show us how we 'vomit' all our troubles (pain bodies) on other people who really dont even want to hear this info to begin with. these chapters also show how communication is a two way street and that persons pain bodies flow right back to us, each energizing each other building negativity. chapters 7,8 guides us as to who we really are and to recognize our own inner peaceful space. chapter 9 guides us to what our inner purpose in life is. chapter 10 completes the enlightenment process by identifying that the each day can have the best chance for happiness if we live by utilizing the qualities of acceptance, enjoyment, and enthusiasm. if only everyone was awakened to enlightenment, we would all spread peace and joy rather than spreading our pains and needlessly competing with other egos. the earth would then be A NEW EARTH.
B0013J30W2|3.0|In Wanted, we have contemporary cinema back in spotlight. This film has a solid starcast which will give it an initial boost but it will not do too well in my estimate because it lacks \\"psychological inertia\\". There are a few interesting plots in the film; which never quite really see maturity or in other words, the film promises but never delivers. The director could have done a better job at being ahead of it's audience. It all seemed like a 45-60 day shoot to me rather than a movie, a picture with thrill and anticipation and drama and impact.<br /><br />If you're looking to watch similar films try these. \\"Running Scared\\", \\"Eastern Promises\\", \\"Lucky Number Slevin\\", \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Bank Job\\". Morgan Freeman is an intelligent man because he stayed away from being an even more integral part of the movie. I also found that some scenes too self-indulgent for me to be involved. The action direction was fun to watch but almost cheesy when you look at some of the sets which were used. Overall, fair but not memorable. Thankyou.
B0015KO52S|5.0|Greta cd, with great songs, great musicians, one of the freshest cd's I've heard in a long long time, I definitely think that Jack White III is one of the few geniuses of the actual American music.<br />The structure of the songs is also very appealing!<br />A 10!
0440178002|5.0|This is a good novel, in that it's a well researched, well plotted and well told tale. It's good and long, it holds the attention, and it holds up over re-readings.
B00104QSOM|1.0|I'm a pretty big Daniel Day Lewis fan. I think he's one of the great actors left in hollywood. He does not dissapoint in this movie either. He does a great job creating the character that in many ways is very similar to the Butcher character he played in Gangs of New York. However, setting the great acting aside this movie sucked. It was one of those movies i came into expecting to love but ended up hating. I sat through it once and I will not ever set through it again. It was long boring and pretentious. The movie was well acted by all involved but a well acted movie without a true storyline makes it a very unwatchable film. Its a mess from beginning to end. As such i cannot recommend it to anyone out there. I know for some reason a lot of people love this movie but for regular \\"joe American\\" this movie will be a borefest. I actually like artsy movies but this one was too much of nothing for me to like it. Not to mention i hated all the characters in it except for maybe Plainview's adopted son and his bit part didn't help out the movie in the least. So there you go. I know I'll get hated by a lot of you out there who love this but i just can't bring myself to review this movie anyway other than honestly. 1 star avoid it if you can.
B00003CXAA|5.0|A must have collection and makes a great gift for someone who loves this masterpiece.
B00177Y9ZC|2.0|Jumper is a neat concept but a neat concept does not make a good movie. Hayden Christensen plays a man who can open personal portals to anywhere in the world he can think to go. He misuses his gift and it gets him in trouble with a Samual L. Jackson's character and a secret agency that wants to destroy all jumpers. Keep in mind I can't remember any of the characters names and that pretty much somes up the problem with this movie. The character development is lackluster and nothing about Jumpers are ever explained. All of that i guess is saved for the sequel that will never be released unless its straight to dvd. Thats the problem with setting up for a sequel in an unknown franchise that it may not become a franchise. I don't think Jumper will unless it goes the straight to dvd or tv route. Overall Jumper is an ok time, if you leave your brain at the door. The main character does bad things and doesn't use his powers for good and by the end of the movie he still is doing basically what he wants and it leads you to believe he is changing though. That change will come with the never to be released sequel. Sigh. Jumper could have been a fantastic sci fi adventure romp but ends up being an ok popcorn movie you can watch to kill some time then forget that it exists. I say watch it if you can for free but don't go out of your way to see it.
B0002O7XW2|4.0|I was re-reading the paperback, (with its excessive use of scotch tape) and decided to come and seek out the movie. The book was of course, phenomenal, and what made me laugh was the part where Darnell asks, \\"Where the hell do you buy HALF a grill?\\" because when they mentioned it, I wondered the same thing.<br /><br />I kinda missed that in the movie. i would have loved to feel the anxiety of the car nuts KNOWING you can't buy half a grill.<br /><br />I liked Darnell's and LeBay's characters in the movie, but in the book, they mentioned repeatedly that Darnell was smart enough to have been \\"in business\\" for a long time...so why would he go sit in the car after watching it pull into stall 20 driverless? Smart guys tend to operate on feel and instinct, not logic.<br /><br />Also, most brilliant use of George Thorogood's \\"Bad to the Bone,\\" possible. I vote it best title song since either \\"Casino,\\" \\"Psycho,\\" or (my personal favorite) \\"Cheech and Chong's Up In Smoke;\\" using War's \\"Low Rider.\\"<br /><br />If you like \\"flubs\\" in props, note Janet Lee's eye twiching twice at the shower scene conclusion, and in Up in Smoke, note the Ludwig Vistalite drums (ie, John Bonham, Karen Carpenter (blue set, no bottom heads on the doc \\"Remembering the Carpenters\\"--amazing jazz player!!!), and Keith Moon (clear set, no bottom heads in Carmine Appice's \\"Classic rock Drum Solos\\"--GREAT video--the BEST!) in the back seat with the drumhead on and off several times in the same shot.<br /><br />For some reason, note the band arguing onstage in the latter, also.<br /><br />In \\"the Blues Brothers,\\" I noted the other night that Dan Ackroyd is singing on the track, but NOT at the show. Not to mention the drums on the track in several spots don't match the movie drummer.<br /><br />The mall they drove through was the Dixie Square in Harvey Il, was closed two-three years before the movie, and is online was it is now at [...] which is a great well-documented site.<br /><br />There's a worse case of drums not matching audio in the movie, \\"Auto Focus.\\" Really, the worst case of mismatched audio music/drum to track drums/music I've ever seen...Also features a gorgeous maroonie-red '74 Lambo Espada. Which'd be worth watching the whole film for even if you hated it. But, no, it's still a good movie, and fun, like \\"Christine.\\"<br /><br />There's a bit of this phenom in \\"The Gene Krupa Story,\\" which is THE movie to buy if you ever loved a drum part. It's forgivable, as Sal Mineo (\\"Rebel Without a Cause\\") was very good (as he'd have to be to fake Krupa), but the audio's Gene Krupa himself!!e worst case of mismatched audio music/drum to track drums/music I've ever seen...Also features a gorgeous maroonie-red '74 Lambo Espada.

0312360266|5.0|MARKED  P.C. CAST AND KRISTIN CAST    Rating: 5 Enchantments    Sixteen year old Zoey Redbird is just like any other typical teenager, worrying over the geometry test she has to take tomorrow-that is, until she's marked by a tracker and her entire world changes. Everyone knows what happens next, Zoey needs to go to the House of Night, the vampire finishing school to complete the change or else she could die without ever having the chance to complete the change.    MARKED is unlike any paranormal I've ever read. P.C Cast and Kristin Cast create an intriguing paranormal world in which to set the House of Night series. There are stages to becoming a full fledged adult vampire, and at any point in time, a fledgling's body can reject the change, as Zoey soon learns, perhaps a nice foreshadowing of things to come?    Zoey isn't your average vampire fledgling. Her mark is colored in almost immediately, which makes her somewhat of a freak at House of Night and an easy target for the bitchier brigade, led by Aphrodite, the head of the Dark Daughters and Sons, a selective group of students at the House of Night. Zoey would be happy to stay far away from Aphrodite and her cohorts, only her mentor, the High Priestess Neferet encourages her to join the Dark Daughters. As Zoey can't say no to her new mentor, she finds herself at the ritual. And when things later get out of control, it may be Zoey is the only one who can right things, much to the chagrin of her nemesis.    I was hooked from page one into this amazing book. From Zoey's indifferent parents (I literally cheered when she snuck out of the house to get away from them) to Nyx, the goddess, the story is populated with amazing characters who come alive within the pages of MARKED.    MARKED is the first book in the House of Night series. [...]    Lisa  Enchanting Reviews  May 2008

B000FVBLEI|5.0|This album is simply awesome. All That Remains' 2006 masterpiece &#34;The Fall of Ideals&#34; is without question the best album that the band has to offer thus far, and it's also one of the best modern metal/metalcore albums that I've listened to as well. I enjoyed their 2004 release &#34;This Darkened Heart&#34; very much as well, but this album is much better, and not to mention that it also has more variety as well. These Massachusetts metalcore bruisers keep on getting better with each album, and believe me &#34;The Fall of Ideals&#34; is indeed full proof. In my honest opinion, I think ATR are just way too good to be even considered a metalcore band, because they have so much characteristics that separate them from other typical &#34;core&#34; bands including guitar solos, and believe me, this album is just chock full of them. &#34;The Fall of Ideals&#34; is also the first ATR album to feature female bassist Jeanne Sagan and drummer Shannon Lucas (who is currently doing time with The Black Dahlia Murder). Together these two make such a sick, monstrous, crushing rhythm section on this album. Jeanne's bass on here is pretty good, and Shannon's drumming is just fast, savage, insane, and complexed throughout. He even throws in some sickening blast beats as well, and he also does a fantastic job at slamming on the double bass too. Oli Herbert and Mike Martin's guitar work on here is just absolutely brilliant. The riffs are just fast, heavy, crushing, and aggressive and the solos are amazing and perfectly executed. Like I said before, there's lots of great solos on this album. Philip Labonte's vocals are just simply amazing, and they're also varied throughout on this album as well. He can go from a nasty, frightening shriek, to a harsh, angry hardcore scream and shout, to wicked, guttural, full-bodied death metal growls, to splendid clean singing vocals. There's no doubt that Philip is one of the best vocalists in metal today.<br /><br />Every song on here is just great plain and simple, but here's a look at some of the highlights on here anyway.<br /><br />Opening blister &#34;This Calling&#34; immediately opens up the flood gates with a loud, throat ripping scream from Philip, along with fast, dominating double bass drum work, and mad head-rushing guitars. There's also a great catchy melodic sung chorus and a great winding melodic guitar solo as well. Track three &#34;It Dwells in Me&#34; is another highlight that is highlighted by crushing machine gun-like riffing, awesome wailing solos, slamming double bass onslaughts, and nasty, aggressive screaming from Philip. The fifth song &#34;Whispers (I Hear Your)&#34; starts off with a nice, melodic acoustic intro and seconds later they give way to heavier, crushing riffs. There's also some great vocals from Philip including some great clean singing in the chorus which is also great, as well as another great solo. The sixth track &#34;The Weak Willed&#34; is highlighted by wicked death metal growls from Philip, as well as some more great, solid drumming from Shannon including some clobbering blast beats, while track seven &#34;Six&#34; is another favorite that is also highlighted by more clobbering blast beats and wild speaker shredding riffs and leads and another nice solo. Track nine &#34;The Air That I Breathe&#34; is another highlight on here that features some catchy machine gun-like leads, more awesome soloing, and another great melodic chorus, and track ten &#34;Empty Inside&#34; features more busy double bass work, some more blast beats, nasty, angry shouts and shrieks, mad skull crushing riffs and another melodic careening solo to boot.<br /><br />Jeremy's song ratings:<br />1. This Calling (3:38) - 5/5<br />2. Not Alone (3:30) - 5/5<br />3. It Dwells in Me (3:14) - 5/5<br />4. We Stand (3:47) - 5/5<br />5. Whispers (I Hear Your) (3:39) - 5/5<br />6. The Weak Willed (4:05) - 5/5<br />7. Six (3:22) - 5/5<br />8. Become the Catalyst (3:06) - 5/5<br />9. The Air That I Breathe (3:34) - 5/5<br />10. Empty Inside (3:22) - 5/5<br />11. Indictment (3:42) - 5/5<br /><br />See, every song gets a 5 out of 5.<br /><br />Bottom Line: &#34;The Fall of Ideals&#34; is the best album that All That Remains have to offer thus far in their career, and it's also their most varied album as well. If you're a fan of All That Remains, metal, metalcore, hardcore, etc, then by all means you'll definitely love &#34;The Fall of Ideals&#34; Even some fans of melodic death metal will enjoy this album as well.

B0018TLRTU|4.0|The only reason I gave the DVD 4 stars is it didn't include \\"Scream\\" and \\"White Wedding\\" is still censored. I remember watching W W on MTV when it was 1st released and it had the wedding ring being put on the (Perri's?) finger & drawing blood. Wonder if that was deleted because of the powers that be or if Billy wanted it that way.Did go see Billy on 6/30. Fantastic show! I'm still smiling. Looked great, sounded great and Steve Stevens was just like he had stepped out of one of the videos. Billy really interacted with the crowd, even 50-f*%king-5 me! The sweetest bad-boy out there...I usually don't go see oldy-moldy groups, (can be so disappointing) but Billy hasn't lost an iota of his appeal. In fact he was better then when I saw him in the '80's. Can't wait to see what's next...
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|What a waste of film, time & money!! I actually got my money back for this film in Riverside California. I am an avid monster fan of horror & the sci fi genera (as this is what my magazine has catered to fans for the past 20 years) Cloverfield delivered NOTHING with this hand held made movie, all it delivered was a nauseating experience. Even low budget documentaries do not have that much camera movement, the camera movement was OVERDONE!! \\"Have you ever heard of camera stabilization\\"?! You can't even see the monster or the crawling creatures because of this shotty camera work. It seems that everyone is always trying to come up with something new to awwwww it's audience & yet they have just re-created what has already been done (Blair Witch Project). It is evident that this director did not read all the negative reviews that Blair Witch received on it's over done camera movement. What these new directors need to do is stick to good old fashioned movie making without those cheap camera effects & stop trying to think of a new way to film. This movie would receive zero stars if permitted by Amazon. All I can say is, \\"It's the worst movie I have EVER seen & thousands agree with me\\"!

B000HF0IIC|1.0|Okay, admittedly all I've seen is the trailer and all I've heard are comments by other people, but even that it is enough to say with some confidence that if you have any regard for the character of Batman/Bruce Wayne DO NOT waste your time on this movie. Even the catchy quotes that appeared in the trailer were all wrong, and out of character for the Dark Knight. That smile of his? Yeah, not unless he was faking it for a reason, or had just been gassed by the Joker. Heaven forbid! If you want a good Batman movie, rent/buy Batman Begins.
B000TU16GS|5.0|wow. that was my first alex rider book and i must admit i finishedit the same day i bought this. great adventures however books are never perfect. one of the flaws for this book would be. well for me,  that it didnt seem realistic. but really, you dont notice it when your reading unless you think it over pondering7 like me. haha. i would recomend this book.
0810993139|5.0|This is an excellent story and easy read for preteens and adults alike.  The lead character's misadventures are hilarously funny gems with little morals tucked inside.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a middle schooler at home.  Also, Amazon delivered this item as promised, at a fair price, securely packed and in excellent condition.  I will order future books through Amazon due to their superior service.
B000KC86F4|1.0|Let me start by saying Bryan Singer made the biggest mistake of his life turning down X-Men 3 for Superman Returns (what a bomb).  They got one of the biggest hack directors in Hollywood, Brett Ratner to finish off what could have been a stellar trilogy.  Instead, we got a crappy \\"reinterpretation\\" of one of the best X-Men stories of all time, the dark Phoenix saga.  Ratner strips this storyline of all emotion, even stripping Jean Grey/Phoenix of her fire powers (uh, isn't that the point of the entire character?)  The last shot of X2 was of the Phoenix's fire emblem in the lake, which is completely abandoned in this travesty.  The other two sticking points of this hack script are the off-screen death of Scott Summers/Cyclops WTF? and the death of Professor Xavier, the mainstay of this entire franchise.  I sincerely hope the Wolverine and Magneto movies return some semblance of dignity to this franchise, which was Marvel's strongest, after what this asinine director did to this film.

B0014DBZT2|5.0|Best album of the year. I can't get this out of my CD player. If this CD came out from a better known artist than Nick it would be all over the radio. That is my only problem with the CD. Not enough people will hear it. Sorry Nick but I've burnt  a bunch of these and gave them to friends who otherwise would not have heard it. The response has been great, everyone loves it. This CD more appeals to the masses than most of Nick's other stuff so I hope the hardcore Nick fans aren't hating it. I've purchased a lot of music I really like lately; Consolers of the Lonely, Mudcrutch, Felice Bros, Weezer Red album and REM Accelerate but I keep coming back to Dig Lazarus Dig. I have tickets for him at the Wamu Theatre in October. I haven't seen him in probably 20 years and I can't wait.
B000R9RGF6|5.0|This is wonderful music.  Much of the music I listen to is \\"background\\" music for some other activity.  This can be used for that, too (e.g., a nice dinner party), but this is also great just by itself, to sit and listen to.  I also play the piano, and I have found it to inspire my own \\"off-the-cuff\\" compositions.
0061474355|5.0|I love Garth Nix. As far as fantasy writers go, he's pretty awesome. In addition to insanely original stories, Nix's eye for detail is astounding. The world building within his novels (any of his novels) is a sight to behold.<br /><br />Sabriel is the first book I read by this author. Rounding out at 489 pages in the paperback edition, this book is long. And, it's best said now, the text is dense. Totally worth every minute, but an involved read nonetheless. So, although I adore this book, before I even get into the review, I suggest that readers looking for shorter books by Nix (or books to give a younger reader) take a look at his \\"Keys to the Kingdom\\" series (starting with Mister Monday) which is geared more towards older children/young adults than a YA/adult audience (which is the target group I'd pick for this novel if anyone asked me).<br /><br />Sabriel lives in a world divided, quite literally, by the Wall. To one side lies the Old Kingdom, realm of magic and much else besides. On the other side lies Ancelstierre, a world not dissimilar from our own of the late 1800s/early 1900s. Born in the Old Kingdom, Sabriel knows of the Charter magic that binds all things. Latest in a long line of Abhorsens, Sabriel also knows more than most about death. One day, eighteen-year-old Sabriel, like her father, will become an Abhorsen--a necromancer. But instead of raising the dead, Abhorsens put the dead to rest. Or, if that fails, bind them where they cannot return to Life.<br /><br />When her father, the Abhorsen, becomes trapped in Death--a dangerous river few can find and fewer walk away from--Sabriel has to leave the relative shelter of her boarding school across the Wall in order to assume her rightful duties as the next Abhorsen and save her father, and perhaps many others, from the dead that would keep him and claim the world of the living for themselves.<br /><br />This story is rife with action and suspense. Along the way it even has some humor and romance. And, of course, a fair bit of very well-managed fantasy is thrown into the bargain.<br /><br />I've said it before, and I'll say it again, Nix is a masterful writer. Every word feels vital to the narrative as a whole. Each sentence is evocative. Frankly, when people talk about reading being an experience, Sabriel is the kind of book they're talking about: the writing here is so good that it isn't just read, it really is experienced.<br /><br />Originally published in 1995, Sabriel is the first book in Nix's Abhorsen Trilogy followed by Lirael (2001) and Abhorsen (2003) as well as a related novella in Across the Wall, a collection of short stories from 2005. Although this novel sets up all of the events and characters of the subsequent novels in the trilogy, this book does stand alone. Of the three, it's really the only one that can be read without the other parts and remain coherent and satisfying (the other books rely heavily on previous events and the second one does have a cliffhanger). Regardless of where it fits in the trilogy and how the novels inter-relate, Sabriel remains one of the best books I have read. Ever.l-managed fantasy is thrown into the bargain.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Until I viewed the HBO Miniseries, \\"John Adams\\", my impression of the American patriot had been based largely on William Daniels' brilliant, if preening rooster, in the musical, \\"1776\\". After viewing Paul Giamatti's fabulous, more grounded portrayal, I must admit THIS is by far the best Adams you'll ever find! Proud, yet insecure, lacking the sophistication of Jefferson,  stature of Washington, or urbane wittiness of Franklin, Giamatti's Adams is occasionally coarse, frequently headstrong, but makes up, in fervor, what he lacks in tact. Unlike Daniels' 'take', he is certainly no genius (his thinly-veiled envy of Jefferson and Franklin provides some of the story's conflict, and humor), but he is an impassioned activist, a 'doer' without whom America would never have been born. The first third of the series, covering the Revolutionary War, 'reinvents' Adams for modern audiences, and is both fascinating, and quite moving.<br /><br />Based on David McCullough's celebrated biography, and filmed largely in eastern Europe and Williamsburg, VA, the series wonderfully captures the 'look' of the times, from untamed wilderness, to cities both old and grimy, and young and dynamic. In this tableau, rough-hewn Americans contrast sharply with coiffed Europeans, providing a nice visualization of the difference between the Old and New Worlds, and justification for the existence of a new nation. In the entertaining 'middle' segments of the production, Adams is thrust into European society, a bull in a china shop who embarrasses both Franklin (a terrific Tom Wilkinson, looking eerily like the legendary Founding Father), and later, Jefferson (Stephen Dillane, who lacks Jefferson's height and charisma, but is quite good). Despite the loyal friendship of George Washington (a dead-on, very effective David Morse), Adams proves a disastrous diplomat and Vice President, and is stymied as President by a near-fanatical fear of terrorism (shades of 9/11 and today!)<br /><br />Perhaps the series' finest moments come when Adams leaves office, and tries to adjust to life as a farmer and forgotten 'hero of the revolution'. Here, Laura Linney's contribution, as Abigail Adams, truly shines; a loving, feisty, politically savvy woman, she now ages gracefully as a supportive wife and heartsick mother (particularly during the illness and death of daughter 'Nabby', portrayed sensitively by Sarah Polley). Linney and Giamatti's scenes together, terrific throughout the series, are especially poignant as their lives draw to a close. Another plus in these chapters is the renewal of the Adams/Jefferson friendship, through correspondence, as two old warhorses face a changing world and mortality, together (both would die on the same day, July 4th, fifty years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence...a touch no author would dare invent, but true!)<br /><br />\\"John Adams\\" is an epic achievement, and the perfect way to celebrate Independence Day, any time you pop it into your DVD player!ts come when Adams leaves office, and tries to adjust to life as a farmer and forgotten 'hero of the revolution'.

B000001FDI|5.0|Ok, I was around when this albumn came out. We loved Cream, and we loved Spencer Davis Group. The combination seemed perfect, and it was, just not long enough. As far as the Clapton song, Presence of the Lord, it sounds a lot like his later works, meaning,  forget me, I am not a rock star anymore. A very whiny song, not even worth listening too. Winwood's songs are great, as always. Now, as far as the main bain of my contention, the drum solo in Do What You Like, what is everybody's problem???????? This is by far the 3rd best song on this album. Ginger Baker was probably the greatest rock drummer of all time, and this solo proved it. When everybody came in at the end of it, what a bang. The flip side sort of sucks, but the second side rocks. Oh well, taste is so wierd.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Very good movie. Make sure you have plenty of tissues. It is a tear jerk movie. I could watch it over and over.
B0015519VS|4.0|I have to say that I didn't expect to like this album, even after hearing good reviews from friends about it. Well, I'm really glad I gave it a shot, it's a wonderful, mature album and I basically like every song. Usher did a great job this time around.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Like many of you out there, I have been a Madonna fan since I was in grade school, over 20 years ago.  I've been through the ups and downs of her career, through all of the publicity stunts and changes of style.  While I was hoping for another album similar to Confessions (which I LOVED), Hard Candy holds it's own.  It is time for Madonna to enter the 21st Century and take a bit of a risk, a departure.  That's exactly what she does with Hard Candy, but without losing that essential Madonna vibe/sound.<br /><br />This CD has a very dance, pop hip-hop vibe.  With masters like Justin Timberlake and Timbaland, you can't lose.  While at times certain songs hit the wrong note, you've got to give her props for trying something a bit more modern and different than what she's ever done previously.  Overall I'd say that JT is a genius in what he's done with this cd!<br /><br />My favorite songs are: 4 Minutes, Devil Wouldn't Recognize You, Miles Away, Incredible, Voices and Give it to me.<br /><br />I hope that this CD gives her back the spotlight here in the US. I feel it was WELL deserved after Confessions, but apparently due to pissing off the wrong people, it wasn't given the airplay.  Unfortunately it's the fans that are losing out, because although in my opinion Music, Ray of Light and American Life were not great CDs, her last two are.  So, if you're a doubtful fan, give Hard Candy a shot!  I think again, both with Confessions and this CD that Madonna has gone back a bit to her roots with pop like dance songs.  And if you haven't been a Madonna fan in the past but you like the typical dance stuff played on the radio, I'd suggest this CD to you as well.  Overall, it's a hit!!
0385340567|1.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed Lee Child's previous offerings I was more than a little disappointed in 'Nothing to Lose'. Very little action and very little suspense. If this had been the first Lee Child book I'd read, I don't think I'd ever read another. Fortunately, his other books are great. Maybe it's time for Jack Reacher to retire to a quiet life.[[ASIN:142088865X This Side of the Gate]]
0385338724|4.0|Not quite up to par with the Shopaholic books, but this was a very fun and enjoyable read.  A beach type of book for sure, but you will be able to whip through it in one sitting.  Dealing with a woman who has to rediscover/redefine her life, the book deals with lots of fun questions about assessing life and figuring out what you want if you could recreate it.  Would you want to?  Lots of fun.

B0019IB26I|5.0|I just picked up a copy of \\"Where the Light Is\\" and was extremely impressed.  This is hands down John Mayer's best album.  This isn't a live Mayer rehash like the second disc of Continuum (which was good, but nothing compared to this.)  Every song on this album is the best version out there of that song.  The new songs are top notch.  \\"In Your Atmosphere\\" is a great song that brings us back to the Inside Wants Out era.<br />If there's one Mayer album to get, this is it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-\\"Daughters\\"... acoustic!<br />-\\"In Your Atmosphere\\"... great new song!<br />-Very good price.<br />-Contains almost all of Continuum's songs.<br />-Three albums in one: Acoustic Set, Trio Set, and Band Set.<br />-The Trio fixes a few of the weaker songs on Try and electrifies them.<br />-Seven thousand people go nuts at the start of a slow blues song in the year 2007.  \\"All is not lost.\\"<br />-Mayer's guitar is on fire.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Cheesy monologue breaks up \\"Bold as Love.\\"
B0010X73ZG|5.0|Several fundamentalist churches have taken exception to the way Marcia Gay Harden's character was depicted, and have encouraged their faithful to give this wonderful movie bad ratings, in the hope of reducing the number of people who buy it.

B0002EXH40|4.0|I have only vague memories of this disc's original mix, but this new mix seems to layer the vocals for richer texture and bring out certain guitar elements a little better.  Remixed, the disc remains one to be listened to over and over, playing air guitar and (trying anyway) to growl and wail along with Dave Mustaine's vocals.  The first three songs make a compelling set together; if you're listening in your car and reach your destination before these songs finish, you're going to want to sit there, parked, listening until they're done.<br /><br />The disc's low point is Family Tree. It's a competent song, but it tries a little too hard and falls short of the rest of the disc.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I have seen the BBC version and this version many times. Having just completed reading the book again yesterday, I wanted to watch this movie to cap it off. For all of the doubters, it truly is a wonderful portrayal of the characters, their over-the-top strengths and weaknesses, and incredible cinematography, which captures Elizabeth Bennett very well. In the book, Elizabeth is supposed to be only 20 years old, and Kiera Knightly brings an excellent zeal and youthfulness to the character, not found in the BBC version. The angst and lovesickness seen in Mr. Darcy is accurate to the writer's wishes, and the absurdity of Lydia, Mrs. Bennett and the girls is portrayed well. The director took a little license with Mr. Bennett's character, making him a little more caring and loving than the book portrays but it adds a nice element to the movie without detracting from the true story line.     I loved it! I have loved it! I will continue to love it!

B0018AK9RA|2.0|I have been a priest fan from back in the 70's when they opened for KISS and no one knew who they where, but for an album that was suppose to be their \\"Darkside of the Moon\\" they fell way short. The only reason this album will get any sales is because it's a good price for a double cd and you can get a free ticket to a show. I find most of the songs boring and too much like a bad movie soundtrack. Hope the next one is back to the Priest we remember.
0385340567|3.0|Nothing to lose started out great, typical Reacher standing up against the bad guys. I was so disappointed when the story took a nose dive and Child started espousing liberal talking points through Reacher. I kept hoping it would change, but it didn't. It ruined Reacher for me, he always took care of business and if there was evil he destroyed it, much like the US is doing in Iraq. We are destroying evil so it won't grow and fester and destroy our world.  I was also disappointed in the fact that Child made Thurman a \\"Born Again End Times Christian\\" Oh for pete sake! Child has read some of the Bible, heard some things and misinterpreted some other things which for some reason made him feel he had to take a swipe at Christianity. This is the 2nd book I have read in the last 3 months that has depicted conservative Christians as being evil, manipulative, greedy etc. etc. The Islamists are killing and destroying their own people, but never a negative word about them from a liberal's mouth. I am disappointed that Child has fallen into this trap of spouting off about something he really has no knowledge of. A Red Cow?? I wonder where he got that little piece of info? Strange.  He got his digs in as intended, but it did sadden me and took away the enjoyment I usually get from his books. I will probably try the next one, but if he continues throwing in liberal politics I may say good bye to Jack.   One last thing, the tension that is normally in one of his books just wasn't there. Instead of fighting really evil people on a personal level, Reacher was fighting our own government's policies because he disagreed. He was obnoxious in this outing and not his normal self. It was almost silly and he seemed immature.   Where did Jack go and who is that taking his place?

0143034901|5.0|It's rare to come across a book as breathtaking and superbly narrated as this one. A novel that makes you wish it were shorter so that you could finish it one read but then makes you yearn for more pages beyond the last, so the story and the spell never ends.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|No, I'm not joking.  Even though \\"The Dark Knight,\\" \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" and award season has yet to grace us with its' presence, the title for best film of the year can already be settled.  \\"WALL-E\\" is a once in a lifetime classic, a pure example of movie magic that soars on the power of untamed imagination.    It is now an undisputable law of nature, right up there with Newton's ironclad rules regarding gravity: Pixar Animation Studios cannot create a bad movie.  It's simply impossible.  \\"WALL-E\\" is just the latest, hell, maybe greatest computer animated feature these wizards have cranked out, and visually, it's awesome.  From the breathtaking shots of a futuristic Manhattan long since abandoned by man and overtaken by arid deserts to the ethereal beauty of outer space, director Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo) and Pixar's peerless animators channel the best imaginations in sci-fi cinema (be it Kubrick, Lucas or Cameron) to craft their own audacious visuals and, in the process, their own sci-fi masterwork.  Make no mistake, this is one of the best pure science fiction films to come out in a long, long time, encompassing themes of environmental neglect and misuse and the corrosive influence of technology on the human condition.  That all holds true, even if it's main character is a lonely trash-compacting robot.    Speaking of that robot, WALL-E itself is one of the most endearing, charming and enchanting characters Pixar has ever devised.  Ben Burtt, who provided the vocal palette that made R2-D2 so emotive, infuses the same anthropomorphic magic into WALL-E.  Combine that with Pixar's patented obsessive attention to expressive detail, and you have a mechanized animated concoction that rarely says a word but beeps, bloobs and sings with soulful life.  For the first 30 minutes of the film, WALL-E, along with his pet cockroach, is all we see as he follows his daily routine, cleaning up the trash and pollution that humanity left behind when it fled a deteriorating and toxic earth for the vast openness of space.  Catch is, WALL-E is the last of his kind.  All the other robots have broken down.  But WALL-E still erects mountains of processed garbage everyday, outrunning sandstorms at dusk while at night watching old movies, his favorite being \\"Hello, Dolly!\\".  And that's the other funny thing: WALL-E has been around so long that his AI has given him something in spades that futuristic humans long since stymied: a spirit that relishes in the simple beauty of odd pieces of junk or in the simple, heart-warming pleasure of hand-holding.  Humanity itself, after 700 years away from Earth and under total control from robotic systems that make them slaves to their own pleasures, has forgotten all of that.  It's WALL-E who exudes all it is that makes being alive worthwhile.    But then, the film skillfully adds another dimension to itself; a moving love story.  One day, a sleek, brilliantly white-colored robot named EVE, who searches for signs the Earth has healed, visits WALL-E.  That and blasting anything that moves.  Her first encounters with WALL-E are funny, touching and make you believe in the universal understanding and power of love.  Their courtship and acts of mutual affection are the stuff dreams are made of.      Once EVE has found what she is looking for, however she shuts down and signals for pick-up, back to the space-bound humans that sent her.  It's here that the film gets a little more straight-forward in its narrative, but you'll still be enthralled by the film's heart-stopping beauty, the deepening love between WALL-E and EVE, the timelessness of it all.  Pixar has outdone themselves.  In aiming for the stars, they crafted a masterpiece that landed among the heavens shining with a life-affirming light.

However, this stuff needs to stay away from Kids. This is not meant for Kids at all. Also this is not a subject you would want to seriously discuss about. If you want to have a good laugh and have some fun, this is a movie to watch. For that matter all the Seasons of South Park will do the job.

B000002L68|5.0|That Minneapolis sound...wow, it has all been stated by others, but the intro to 'Purple Rain'...that BIG, lush, twangy, warm, full-bodied Rickenbacker 330/12 string is one of the masterpieces of Prince's career.  He does more with those few bars than others do with an entire cd.  It sets up a great song and lays the foundation for Prince to come in later with his odd looking, but razor sharp axe, and slice and dice his way through a song that has held up amazingly well since 1984...Man, what a guitar!
B00005JLKB|5.0|\\"Smallville\\" was a show that I feel premiered when the golden age of The WB (sadly its called The CW now) was coming to a close, and was really the only good show that was left on the channel. I'm also a charmed fan, but after Shannen Doherty's departure, Charmed went downhill, (and since Veronica Mars didn't come till later that can't be included in the golden era) so I was excited about this show and was very pleased with it.    Its easy to see why \\"Smallville\\" drew in the largest audience ever on The WB when it premiered. (I'm not sure if it still holds that title but I know that it did at one time)     It tells the story of Clark Kent aka Superman, during his teenage years, living in the small town of Smallville, and shows how he struggles between trying to fit in at his high school (he's not exactly part of the in crowd), deal with his super powers and making sure no one finds out his secret, and of course theres his long time crush Lana Lang (played by the beautiful Kristin Kreuk) who he longs to be with. You also get to see a friendship form between him and his future enemy, Lex Luthor (played by Michael Rosenbaum) after Clark saves his life.    This show does a good job of being a teen drama mixed with sci-fi (although during the first few seasons, its more of a teen drama. It gets more sci-fi during the later seasons I believe)    The only problem with this season is that it seems that during every episode, some random kid is gaining superhuman abilities after being infected by a meteor rock. But beside that....great show! The best part about this season is the season finale, which will leave you dying to see season 2! (which is another great season by the way)    Unfortunately, I can't give you a review on the entire series overall so far, as I  am not up-to-date with the current seasons. But its not due to lack of interest! I watched up until mid-season 3, and then I ended up missing a few episodes and before I knew it, I had missed the rest of season 3,along with the entirety of season 4! So I figure now there's no point in trying to catch up since I've now missed several seasons, and instead just planning on purchasing all the seasons on DVD.    Bottom line: if you have not yet see this show, I strongly urge you to purchase this season!
0307277887|4.0|If you are looking to read this book because you are hooked on the tv show, then you may be surprised.  The book Dexter is a bit more cold and crazy, though still funny at times.  What surprised me most is that the tv show was actually better than the book.  I can't remember the last time (if ever) that I have come to that conclusion.  The story is quite different, but a lot less things happen and before you know it. . . the book is over.  I won't be giving away any spoilers, so you'll just have to find out for yourself.  I would give the tv show a 5 star rating and the book a 4 star.<br /><br />The one thing I really hated about the book were the constant repetitive ramblings about the fact he is a killer and why he even bothers to pretend.  Over and over pages are wasted saying the same thing.  By book #2 I am just skipping over these pages.

B0012Q732O|3.0|This movie reminds me of Jurassic Park The Lost World and Apacalypto (spelling?) merged into one.  It was some sweet action and an understandable story line, just as the movie progressed it lost its edge.  Too much pride for nothing, if you ask me.  I enjoyed it and wouldn't object to watching it again.  Would I buy it, no.  Is it worth the rent or if it's on TV, yes.
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|A few songs are energetic and great, like the opening track.  But many songs sound like bad generic disco, with paper-thin lyrics and listless vocals.     For a good time, buy \\"Ray of Light\\" or \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" instead.    Or, go to some dance club where the DJ knows how to whip these tunes into better shape.  Did I say \\"whip\\"?  Mmmmmmm....
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Lots of good stuff in this movie, including the monster itself, the creatures, the effects, and the deployment of the army/soldiers.<br />What brings it down it the shaky camera work (barf) and most of<br />the actors.<br />Good for a view and not a keeper due to the shaky camera syndrome.

0143035711|5.0|I finished reading Chickenhawk last night just a few minutes after midnight, July 4, 2008. I feel like I oughta apologize to its author, Bob Mason, for taking 25 years to \\"discover\\" his excellent account of one man's horrific wartime experiences in Vietnam over 40 years ago. Sam Hynes, author of the equally excellent WWII pilot's memoir, Flights of Passage, once told me that one of the most important ingredients in a memoir is that the narrator be likeable. Chickenhawk has that most vital element, for Bob Mason is as likeable a guy as you'll find in the literature of war, and his prose is absolutely real and riveting as he tells of his whirling descent into the madness that was Vietnam. His final chapter summarizes the kind of confusing nightmare his life became upon his return home, as he struggled to understand and survive this thing now commonly known as PTSD. I like this guy. In fact I like him well enough that I will try to find a copy of his out-of-print sequel to Chickenhawk. It may take a while, but I'll be back to comment on that one too. In the meantime, I urge anyone who enjoys good writing of any kind to read this book. It's the real deal. - Tim Bazzett, author of SoldierBoy: At Play in the ASA (RatholeBooks.com)
B000YABIQ6|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this. Sometimes hype for TV shows is way overblown, but this is not so with Mad Men, which is arguably the best show on the tele since The Sopranos or Deadwood. The acting is superb, the writing divine, and the sets are magnificently realistic. If you're looking for something good to watch, look no further. This is it. See it now...before your friends tell you all about it.
B000002KDO|5.0|[[ASIN:B000002KDO Black Sabbath - Master of Reality]] I hadn't listened to this album since I bought it on cassette many years ago.  It was as good as I remember!  If you're a Black Sabbath fan from back in the day, this is a must for your collection.  A classic indeed.
B000002U82|5.0|There is a reason that any modern band with progressive, space rock elements is referred to as the \\"Pink Floyd\\" of its respective genre. Pink Floyd is a very important figure in rock history, and anyone who claims to be a fan of music should hear this album at least once.
B0019IB26I|4.0|I really love it when artists give you your money's worth (as opposed to overpriced \\"double albums\\" or throwing in an extra DVD and charging more money for it, etc.).  Here, we have an excellent 2-CD live album for 10 bucks (I paid 12 at a store, but close enough).  I love the presentation of this CD---you get an acoustic set, an awesome blues set from Mayer's trio, and then an entire disc of his full-band stuff.  The sound is great (I wish Rush would mix one of their live albums like this) and Mayer plays his butt off, especially with the trio.  There's a gorgeous version of Free Fallin' which I think would make Tom Petty proud, and overall the musicmanship on here is at a high level.  Not really much criticism to offer for this disc, other than there were a few songs I would have like to have heard here, but overall...100% worth your ten bucks.
0670020745|5.0|Although I did not have a stroke, I found this book extremely helpful. I have had Parkinson's Disease for 10 years (diagnosed in 2000 at age 39)  and Dr Taylor's account and description of reality and cognitive aspects of the human brain that is compromised for any reason, disease or injury,  are right on the mark. She is able to articulate and express what goes on inside the person who is affected by a compromised neurological system. I would highly recommend this as a must read for anyone who is experiencing any problems with either the brain or central nervous system, as well as any caregivers and any family members.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series of dvd's should be shown to all teen agers.  Let's not forget WW2 or our soldiers.
B001AMVN3U|5.0|As I sit here listening to this cd for about the tenth time, it still sounds brand new. This is the best cd 'The Offspring' have recorded since 'Ixnay'. Some reviewers have compared some riffs from this cd to Coldplay and Green Day, saying that they are rip offs. To them I say, are you aware how many f***ing songs are out there? (every single song ever written has another song that sounds similar) This cd is very original and I don't see Coldplay or Green Day at all. There is something for everyone (power ballads, punk tracks, pop punk songs, even a dance rock song) To me, it's like they took their discography and picked two or three of their best songs from each cd and compiled this one. Very very solid cd, and to the reviewer that said they sound like sell outs, how old are you? How old are the offspring? You can't be singing about drugs,  killing your girlfriend, and road rage when you've got a wife and kids. There is a difference between selling out and growing up, blink 182 did the same thing. And whoever said Dexter sounds like Weird Al, I agree.
B00158K0S8|5.0|I have just seen this film in the Blu-ray format and it is superb!! A previous reviewer complained about the lack of grain in the film but that's what made the transfer so great!! Also there is a brief introduction by Francis Ford Coppola before the film starts and it is very insightful about his experiences in gathering information for this classic film.  The transfer, as I stated before, is excellent and duplicates the experience of having seen it in the 70mm format (2:20) in the theatre.  Although the film borders very close to 3 hours, this is one of those films that you wish could last a little bit longer (Scott was dissatisfied with the film and refused the Oscar,later did a TV film version of Patton's last days).  So if you're already a fan of this classic, I do recommend getting this in Blu-ray --I will very shortly!!
0141439580|5.0|A smug but goodhearted society girl learns her judgment isn't as incisive as she thinks it is. \\"Emma\\" is a fun, lighthearted version of Jane Austen, with enough misunderstandings and crossed signals to form the basis of a modern sitcom. For all its pleasant enjoyability, however, the novel is also a fascinating character study of one woman being elevated to a nobler level by being taken down several notches.<br /><br />In this respect, \\"Emma\\" is a prime example of the fact that although many see Jane Austen as something of a proto-feminist, she often gave her male characters the most admirable constitutions of her entire cast. Although the female Emma may be the heroine we hope will triumph, the male Mr. Knightley (like Colonel Brandon of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\") is the unimpeachably noble person, and the one who helps Emma ascend to a higher plane of virtue when she might otherwise have been left in despair at her failures. In the end, Austen's fourth novel (and the last published during her lifetime) is not a feminist manifesto. Rather, it transcends the gender wars and remains a touching comedy of errors with a profoundly subtle commentary on human pride and folly.
B000006IUQ|5.0|This is another movie I enjoy watching over and over and over.  It is never boring.  Any movie with Anthony Hopkins is worth watching!  I am sure everyone agrees.  Him and Alec Baldwin were superb in this movie.  I am glad to own it now on DVD!!  Awesome movie!! Thanks.
032147404X|5.0|This is a must have for anyone who is familiar with photography and wants to move up to the next level.  Scott has a great way of explaining things in a straight forward matter and making you understand the more technical side of this sometimes confusing field.<br /><br />I think I have bought this book 5 times for friends who are getting into the field and would recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />It's so simple and makes you understand what you need to do to know your camera
1582406723|3.0|Some of the more negative reviews of this first Walking Dead book are quite merited. In many ways it feels derivative, even a bit lazy. I'd only like to add that the series does get better, a whole heck of a lot better. Read this first one just so you can get to know the characters, but if you're feeling put off, do yourself a favor and keep going. By the time I was halfway through the second book I was hooked hooked hooked, and I devoured the rest of them as fast as I could. These have some of the best character development I've ever seen in any media, let alone in comic books, which are NOT known for their depth.    Kirkman has made a decent name for himself in this business, and The Walking Dead series is a fantastic testament to his deserving respect.
B000006NPY|4.0|Adore by the Smashing Pumpkins is probably their most misunderstood album ever. I like this album, some of the tracks dabble in electronica especially on the first single, Ava Adore, I just love the lyrics in that song. Songs like Perfect, To Shelia, and Crestfallen display Billy Corgan's sensitive side. This is a stunning album, buy it today!
0060922583|5.0|I don't recall how I became aware of this book, but after I read it (and as many of the author's references as I could find), I became convinced that the thesis that it promotes is one of the most significant ideas of our day. Unless I miss my guess, and I rarely do, these ideas will form the bases for reforming our notions of medicine, theology, philosophy, and virtually every other human endeavor.
B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is the Smashing Pumpkins most complicated and prettiest album. This epic contains two discs so expect a lot of different styles of music, you get a little bit of everything, beautiful ballads with haunting melodies, the alternative rock anthems, and Corgan's quirky unique songs. How can you go wrong with songs like: Thirty-three, Tonight, Tonight, 1979, Bullet with Butterfly Wings, Lily (My One and Only Love), Where Boys Fear to Tread and etc. Important album of the '90s, buy this masterpiece today!

0767821769|4.0|Stepmom starring Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon is a funny and moving film directed by Chris Columbus. Ed Harris also stars and jeez isn't he great in every movie?! I like Roberts in this film, she plays her role as a stepmother with humor and heart. Sarandon's character is a bit annoying but hey she's dying of cancer. Sad, sad, sad film, I highly recommend it!
1423101464|5.0|A must read in the Percy Jackson series!  It has humor, action, adventure, drama.  I am already anxious for Rick Riordan to publish the next one in the series.
6305907145|1.0|I was appalled at this version of 'Mansfield Park,' inasmuch as it bears no real resemblance to the Austen book. Only the names of characters and a few turns of the plot have been kept, but not the essence of the book.  (The Austen book is not a comedy; Fanny Price can be a frustrating heroine for a modern reader because she would never dream of \\"standing up for herself,\\" such a concept would be unthinkable to a character like hers, which represents the ultimate victory of sheer goodness over the blandishments of personality, as represented by the opposing persona of Mary Crawford.)  This film's presentation of Fanny Price seems rather to be the director's/writer's supposition of what Jane Austen herself might have been like, but it's not even a fair representation of the voice of the narrator.  Filmmakers need far more insight into the premises, not merely of the 18th century in general, but more precisely of the Austen consciousness in particular, not overlooking what a profound place religion played in her heart, and that is what is needed in order to portray Mansfield Park the way it might have seemed to its creator. Of course, then it probaby wouldn't be nearly as popular. Remove the title to this film, and it has some merit on its own in terms of crafting, but -- but--.
0802136834|5.0|This is an excellent account of Henry and his many wives. Well researched, very well written - there's hardly a boring passage.
1594481717|5.0|This is not a critique on how this book was written; nor, on whether or not I agree with the theories and methods discussed - with an open mind, it all makes sense to me. What I will say is that Mr. Pink does a very good job at both going into exhaustive detail and summarizes topics into layman terms for everyone's benefit (overall good read and flow). I am 31 years and am concerned about oil prices, the housing crisis and the off-shoring of countless positions to cheaper labor overseas; Mr. Pink offers his richly researched thesis' on how we, as Western's, will maintain competitiveness in our evolving global economy and career landscape. In addition to the analysis the author provides, there are also many other resources cited to aid in your High-Touch journey. Open your mind, expand your thoughts and act.
B000F9RB8A|4.0|This is one of my favorite Kung movies (Action, Comedy Genre) that is not starred by Jackie Chan. Stephen Chow is very funny and riot, if you enjoyed Shaolin Soccer, then you will definitely enjoy Kung Fu Hustle.    My favorite scene in this movie was when Stephen Chow and his buddy was sneaking back into the village, and his chubby friend threw a dagger on his back... that was classic!

B000026156|5.0|This was my introduction to Dave's Music and it was love on first play.  I was also luckily enough to be front row at his Wednesday noon recital at Cornish back in '82; now that was amazing.  This may not be a great LP for a first time jazz listener, or if you consider \\"soft jazz\\" jazz, but it is a true classic.  Every music library should have a copy.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I was skeptical about this when I heard it, but after watching it, I was pleasantly surprised.    The writing and the acting are actually quite good, and like any good show, the writers have created a vehicle for probing the nuances of human nature, good and evil, etc.

0446402389|5.0|12 years ago, I saw an HBO movie called \\"Citizen X.\\"  It was based on the Russian serial killer, Andrei Chikatilo, who was convicted of killing 52 people.  I couldn't peel my eyes away from this movie.  So when I found out that \\"Child 44\\" was based on the same character, I had to read it.  The book was as compelling and engrossing as that movie.  It provides details of an atrocious, all-powerful Soviet Union that created a state of fear and paranoia among its people.  This book focuses on a government that was so arrogant and yet so ignorant that a serial killer could manipulate the system for his own killing vendetta. \\"Child 44\\" is an intelligent read with plenty of mystery and suspense set against a corrupt and bleak regime.
B000001GPX|5.0|This was one of the very first classical music CDs that I ever purchased.  I was somewhat familiar with Beethoven's 5th, but not the 7th.  Needless to say, I have acquired many more CDs since then.  For Beethoven, I feel that I can never have too many recordings of his symphonies.  I own the Zinman/Tonhalle set, the Krips/LSO set, Karajan EMI/Philharmonia set, Gardiner/ORR set, and the Cluytens/Berlin Phil. set.  Of individual recordings of 5 and 7, I have this along with Reiner and the CSO, and Haitink with the LSO of 5/1 (LSO Live).      With all these recordings, what makes this one stand out?  For me, its Kleiber's ability to let Beethoven speak for himself.  Kleiber's interpretations are masterful in the way that they don't necessarily emphasize certain instruments, sections etc.  In this way, Kleiber is similar to Reiner, but I feel that Kleiber, especially with the Vienna Philharmonic, is a lot more muscular.  Reiner's interpretations let Beethoven speak as well, but he has a lighter touch than Kleiber, who adds force where needed.    Sometimes this technique works, but sometimes it does not.  My main point for this is in the horn call of the 5th, first movement.  This may be too powerful, but is certainly better than Reiner's (even though the CSO brass section is certainly better, though restrained).  Kleiber could use some restraint in this sense, but this is a minor quibble.  One other quibble I have is with the tempo of the Allegretto in the 7th.  It seems a little fast, but I certainly enjoy how Kleiber shapes phrases and melodic lines.  I feel that if it was a tad slower, it would have the ability to emote more pathos.  Also, the tempo of the next movement (third of the 7th) seems a bit rushed in some spots, but this does not detract from the music like that of the Allegretto.    In all, Kleiber's Beethoven is similar to Reiner's, but the brass is not as restrained, which adds a great layer of color and excitement.  Even with all my other recordings, Kleiber stands out as natural and muscular Beethoven, even if I have more 'correct' readings (Barenreiter, HIP etc.).  Kleiber's Beethoven makes me not care if the tempos or whatnot are not 'historically correct.'  It may not be historically informed, but it still sounds good to my ears.    Verdict: If you don't have this recording, you should do yourself the favor and pick up this classic disc.
0802136834|5.0|Henry VIII is a fascinating man of history.  He took six wives, arranged to exchange one wife for another, murdered two, lost one to childbirth, rejected another and died before he could find a way to get rid of wife six.  A man of wit, intelligence, excess and greed.  He had an enormous appetite for pleasure, riches and love.  You'll feel as if you're reading exceptional fiction but it really happened.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|(NO SPOILERS HERE)<br />Shame on me for ignoring my own rule of thumb and slurping up so many of the gushing reviews<br />listed here for Wall E.  My expectation going into the theater was somewhere around Pluto, but the film only managed to take me to Saturn.  Normally, Saturn would warrant a rave review, but not when a film falls somewhat short of that ever-so-high bar you carry into the theater.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. Pixar has hit a home run with Wall E. They just did not hit one out of the park, as so many others here would have you believe. The movie really does work on just about every imaginable level. The Pixar animation team most certainly outdid themselves, taking CGI to an impressive and breathtakingly realistic new level. Wall E IS at times thought-provoking, ironic, laugh-out-loud funny, poignant, entertaining, and perhaps, somewhat romantic. Yes, all of this with a highly original story line and offbeat musical accompaniment. Those elements which are borrowed from other movies are at least<br />incorporated with a fresh twist.<br /><br />Wall E does have its shortcomings: A little over the top at times in the \\"Gee, aren't we just the cutest on screen Bots you've ever seen?\\" Department. There are also a couple occasions where the substitution of dialogue for assorted sound effects becomes a bit tedious. Fortunately, the movie is very low key as regards the results of long term ravaging of the environment, not at all in-your-face as so often is the case with movies made in the past few years.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, though, Wall E just doesn't measure up to five stars. Four (maybe 4 and ½) seems to me at least, a much more realistic rating. In any case, please, simply put aside the reviews and just go see Wall E, hopefully, leaving your expectations at the door. You'll probably have a very enjoyable and entertaining hour and a half.
0140067477|5.0|Recommended for everyone, a lighthearted look at the Tao and a simpler way of living through the eyes of my favorite bear. My husband lives the Tao of Pooh. If you're having trouble understanding the Tao, or having a hard time relating to that duck that seems to let the world roll off his back, this book puts everything into perspective. There's no denying the fun in this book; the beautiful, flowing, clear writing style is classic A.A. Milne Pooh, and demonstrates what a perfect example this bear is for the concepts of the Tao.

B000GBEWHA|5.0|Grease will always hold a special place in my heart, it is part of my childhood and holds many nostalgic memories for me.  Saw the movie when I was 8, was given the soundtrack on vinyl (as well as Saturday Nite Fever) for christmas.  Played it on my ladybug turntable, and sang along to every song with my friends, 1978.  The only way to truely watch Grease is on \\"full screen\\".  U just can't enjoy it any other way.  I bought it on widescreen and was totally horrified.  It just doesn't have that same effect.  I later purchased the full screen edition, and again I was in Grease heaven.  Grease is one of the best movies of all time.  Olivia Newton John and John Travolta are fantastic.  This is John Travolta's best movie to date, I don't care what anybody says.  Grease will make u laugh, sing and cry.  it is just an all around, feel good movie that cannot be compared to any other.  Ask yourself this, what would you rather watch, Grease or Gone With The Wind?  It's a no brainer, Grease is the word.  I worked with Stockard Channing once and I just had to tell her I loved her in Grease and that it was an honour to work with her.  At least I got to tell one of the cast members how much I love the movie and how people still remember it to this day.  This film is loved and praised by many people and rightfully so.
B000002KKK|5.0|I can't give much higher praise than this:  I'm having a big party at my house with a live band next month, and after MUCH thought about the five disc rotation in my stereo for when the band's not playing, \\"Deguello\\" just HAD to be in there.  Happy, fun, funny, finely crafted blues rock from the \\"Li'l Ol' Band From Texas\\".  A CLASSIC.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|I love this movie if not for anything else, the fantastic costumes, cinematogrphy and Cate Blanchett's performance.  She looks brilliant as Queen Elizabeth and her acting is incredible.  She's the best, along with Nicole Kidman and Naomi Watts.  This is a film that takes you on a journey like a time machine, and you are met by Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth.  She captivates you with all of her flair and queeny nuances.  The story is bizarre but then again so were those times of wine and roses, \\"let them eat cake\\" so they say.  This is a film that showcases the old school diva.  Elizabeth was the first diva, she is OG, she is gangsta.

B0014I4KIK|5.0|Where are the latest female soul singers coming from?  Detroit?  New York?  New Orleans?  American Idol?  Think again. Duffy, from Wales of all places, is one of the latest of an astonishing parade of girl singers from the British Isles who sound like Billie Holiday with modern muscle.<br /><br />Whereas Billie generally came across as a victim, these new singers exhibit the conflict between being someone's lover and living as their own person.  In the title track of this album, Duffy sounds like the ghost of a 60's singer who has risen up in 2008 to find that she feels perfectly at home.  In this track we first hear her unique voice and style, girlishly innocent but carrying the weight of a woman's experience.  Indeed, in \\"Syrup & Honey\\", she sounds like a predecessor of Janis Joplin, if you can imagine such a thing.  Duffy presents her pain with dignity in \\"Warwick Avenue\\".  Is the title a reference to Dionne?  Might be, since the musical arrangement of \\"Stepping Stone\\" sounds very much like Dionne's \\"Walk On By\\".  And in \\"I'm Scared\\", the victim shuts down completely.  She mentions \\"...the blank pages of my diary...the closed blinds in my home...dust gathers on my stereo 'cause I can't bear to hear the radio.\\"  But her victimization isn't total.  In \\"Serious\\" she suspects that things aren't right and confronts her lover.  In \\"Delayed Devotion\\", her love has turned to hate.  She says it, quite bluntly.  And in \\"Mercy\\", she begs for release but sounds strong and in control at the same time.  To find the equal of this, you'd have to go back to Aretha's early tracks, complete with obligatory backup singers.<br /><br />Perhaps the conflict, the seeming paradox, is summed up in the final track, \\"Distant Dreamer\\".  This one has the sound of the 60's girl-groups, with soaring melody and strings, even the \\"wall of sound\\" associated with producer Phil Spector.  However, the singer of this song, far from being an accepting victim, is just playing the part while dreaming of being her own person instead of someone's accessory.rson instead of someone's accessory.
0670020745|5.0|This is one of the most important eye-opening books I've read in a very long time. It truly takes you through what it feels like to have a stroke (since the author had a major one), offers numerous methods to help your own or a loved one's rehabilitation afterwards, and insights into how the two sections of the brain work together (or apart if affected by a stroke) to shape our personalities and view of the world.  I highly recommended it for anyone who knows someone who has had a stroke, is concerned that they may have one themselves and wants to know what will happen, or wants to learn more about the fascinating workings of the brain.

B0002BO05S|5.0|This movie more than any other has always brought tears to my eyes.  It is so close to the real Jesus and gives a better idea of the Man that He was in life on earth.  His goodness, His kindness, and His holyness is of a Person we can and should try to follow.  If we did this, the world would be a much better place today.  I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would like to see Him taken out of schools or His Ten Commandments tossed, for they are not that hard to follow, and they keep us \\"civilized\\" and better able to get along with one another.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This towering miniseries, based on David McCullough's biography of John Adams, tells the story of one of our Founding Fathers and our second president.<br /><br />The miniseries begins in 1770, when Adams agreed to serve as counsel for British soldiers following the Boston Massacre.  Adams was a leader in uniting the various sections of the colonies for independence from Great Britain.  One of the most poignant scenes in the entire miniseries was the one in which the delegates to the Second Continental Congress voted to issue the Declaration of Independence, and then seemed shocked that they had done so--they must have known how extremely difficult and costly it would be to make the new Declaration stick.<br /><br />Adams then was ambassador to France, the Netherlands, and England, and the miniseries shows the toll that his absence took on his family life.<br /><br />After the Constitution was ratified, he was elected the nation's first vice president and was frustrated in that role.  In 1796, Adams was elected president.  Relations with France were a large part of what Adams dealt with during his presidency--he became very unpopular after the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts, which were passed in 1798 in response to the XYZ Affair and Quasi War.<br /><br />This miniseries accurately portrays the buildings that people lived in and daily objects used by people during our country's founding.  Life was very hard then (there is graphic portrayal of ghastly late eighteenth/early nineteenth century medical techniques--be grateful that you live now and not then).  John and Abigail were the first couple to live in the White House--they moved in just before Adams was defeated in his bid for reelection by Thomas Jefferson in the 1800 presidential election.

0756404746|2.0|Had it been written in about 300 pages, it would have been a good book. Being as it is however it's a real drag to get to the end of it. Sure, there are interesting part, but they're few and far between. When the main character gets into the same situation for the n-th time, and the author doesn't spare the meticulous details describing it, it can be very aggravating. The main character's girlfriend by the way is one of the least likeable female leads in the history of literature.
0345495004|5.0|I lead the discussion for this book at my book club.  All members enjoyed the book and much of the discussion centered on feminism and the Woman Movement.  We thought it was a well-written first novel for Ms. Horan and that she did a good job of blending history and fiction.  We felt the author helped us to understand Mamah's personal struggle and the motivation for her decisions, even if we didn't agree with them.
B000G73UEU|4.0|I bought this CD soundtrack after seeing the video on television.  It contains more songs than the video, including \\"Tower of Song\\" done my Martha Wainright.  I've been a Leonard Cohen fan since the 60s, but lost interest in him when his career seemed to wander and eventually he seemed to disappear.  But the video renewed my interest.  The video was excellent, and I think the CD soundtrack is really a good selection of his songs as well.  It introduced me to Rufus and Martha Wainright and the McGarrigles, singers that had previously escaped my intention.  It also introduced me to Beth Orton, who sings \\"Sisters of Mercy\\" on the video and CD.  So my comment is that it renewed my interest in Leonard Cohen and now I have names of artists I'd never heard of before to follow.
B001B93PQ0|5.0|John Mayer really surprised me with this one! All I had to hear was his cover of \\"Free Fallin'\\" and I was sold!<br /><br />I love his live performance of his hit songs...PLUS all of the AWESOME blues/rock sounds coming out of his guitar.<br /><br />Well...you can tell that he had long studied and admired BB King and Eric Clapton. You can really hear the BB King riffs coming out of that guitar!<br />Awesome double album! I've listened to it twice now and never cease to tire of it.<br />This was also my first mp3 purchase from amazon and as a Mac user I have to say that the experience was extremely easy. Love the DRM-free music.
B000002UQJ|4.0|Paul's problem -- or so many people's problem with Paul -- is that he writes bad songs. He certainly has written a lot of them in the same vein, so it's not like he's not being true to himself. We loved his Beatles work, probably more so because it was offset by the songs of John and George. He always insisted he was a rocker, but he was more of a music hall nostalgic. His themes have been pure and noble, but also shallow. \\"Silly Love Songs\\" is likely his manifesto, and thank God it's bouncy and fun. \\"Off the Ground\\" is riddled with clunkers, as if he forgot temporarily how to craft something riveting, which, of course, he at times is expert at. This album is as maddening as \\"Driving Rain,\\" with melodies so exquisite side by side with buzz killers that beg for a flick of the remote. But twice he gets it so right that he simply towers again as one of the great gods of pop rock -- \\"Golden Earth Girl\\" is so shimmery and sad and lovely. At a time in which we have polluted the planet so thoroughly, Paul, in song, has given us a vision of crystal purity, a reminder of what we have soiled, with a melody as perfect in its majesty as he has ever written. Second, \\"Winedark Open Sea\\" finally harnesses Paul's fascination with simplicity in something very deep. The chords repeat over and over, like waves lapping . . . it is an existential plaint, a deep lamentation on the limits and limitlessness of time and love, and the great sea is his metaphor. I hope Linda loved this song because it might have been his greatest musical gift to her...
B001ACY8D2|5.0|Put it in, Turn up the volume, and Enjoy your vacation.  Sigur Ros has this uncanny ability to warp the world around you, and it it well demonstrated in their latest album.  Very few things get me in a better mood in the morning.
B0000630BT|5.0|With the dawn of the '90s comes Judas Priest's \\"Painkiller\\", possibly the greatest and one of the most influential speed metal albums of all time. Between Rob's always-impressive range of vocals shattering the air, KK and Glenn's jaw-dropping guitar work and newcomer Scott Travis's complex, thundering drumming, this album is one of the absolute finest releases by the Metal Gods.  There's no doubt when it comes to the fact that Judas Priest has experimented a bit over the years. Their earlier works were bluesier and more progressive, their '80s classics delved in New Wave of British Heavy Metal. In terms of the sound on this album, if compared to other artists, it's kind of like taking the thick, rich epic guitar-and-drum tone of Mercyful Fate, mixed with the speed and sinister riffage of Slayer and the melody and talent of Van Halen, only faster, heavier and a more epic sense of melody. However, that's only comparing them to other artists, I feel that \\"Painkiller\\" has a sound that totally original Judas Priest. And \\"Painkiller\\" is the Holy Grail of adrenaline-driven metal of the past 20 years. It's the high-water mark probably most metal bands today aim at. And you've got to be honest and say that all these songs, as fast and wild as they are, still are very well written.  One great thing about the album is that it's a concept album. The Painkiller is the hero, and the Nightcrawler is the villain, and most of the album between those two songs is about triumph in battle, and the evils that lurk in the night. Yes, this is indeed Priest at their finest.  Another thing that makes this album more interesting is the order of the songs. I mean, sure, they've gotta be in a certain order to make a sensible concept, but I love how the songs go from tense to comfort, and back and forth. The dynamics of the album are just as impressive as the musicianship, songwriting and singing.  Some of my favorite songs on this metal classic are:  \\"Painkiller\\": The six-minute epic that opens the album, kicking the song off with some blast beat drumming and a heavy, sinister guitar riff. Lots of blazing, power-packed guitar soloing fill out this album, with Rob screeching all the way through with his signature power.  \\"Hell Patrol\\": A nice contrast of \\"Painkiller\\", like I was talking about. It rocks just as hard but it's got more of a comfort level than a tension like \\"Painkiller\\". More great riffs, and Rob uses his cool mid-range voice for this song.  \\"Metal Meltdown\\" opens with 30 seconds of pure guitar shredding, a great way to open the album. In comes a fast, melodic but sinister riff and lightning drums, and Rob using his powerful voice as always.  \\"Nightcrawler\\": The headbanger of a song that's about the villain in the concept album. Features a creepy and tense, quiet section where Rob sings about the Nightcrawler being like a villain in a slasher film. Very interesting song.  \\"A Touch of Evil\\": An epic song at over five and a half minutes, combining awesome keyboards, guitar work and lyrics. One of the best metal songs ever, indeed.  \\"One Shot At Glory\\": Is the lengthy, epic anthem that closes out the original album with a bang!  In addition, the album comes with the moody \\"Living Bad Dreams\\" and a live version of \\"Leather Rebel\\". So to sum myself up, \\"Painkiller\\" is one of the best speed metal/ power metal albums ever to be released. I strongly recommend this to all Judas Priest fans, and all metal and rock fans, because it's an amazing, well-written classic. Thanks for the time, and peace.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|My four year old received these blocks for his birthday and they haven't been left alone since. They stack amazingly well so we have created so many different things that you cannot do with regular building blocks. I definitely recommend these blocks to anyone looking for a great set of blocks (planks) that allow for a lot of imaginative play - for you and your child.
0525948023|5.0|Book arrived in great shape - haven't finished it but it sure looks very good :)
B000RZIGVS|4.0|This set you see here from Amazon is the Authentic Anniversary Collection set from Paramount.  The set called the \\"Chosen Collection\\" is bootleg. I am bringing this up because someone posted the pictures of the \\"Chosen Collection\\" next to the authentic set. Be careful of fakes.    I am happy with the Authentic Anniversary Collection set from Paramount.I am glad I have the entire series.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Despite having enjoyed 'The Committments' lo those many years ago, I had little interest in this film or its music. Until, of course, I broke down and watched it under duress, and was thrown into a bewilderment of emotions I could not have believed possible. Such a little film with such a big heart; I abhor blatant sentimentality, but this was something genuinely special, in no small part because of the awkward charm of this score/soundtrack. Neither of these two have particularly good voices, even by folksinger standards; the piano and guitar are relatively generic; and even the lyrics are not overly original. And yet everything together is so honestly beautiful that I can't recall the last time I was so touched by a fusion of music and imagery.<br /><br />I also think this album stands alone fairly well, but I am biased because of the connection I feel to the film upon listening to it. I wonder what somebody who heard these songs who hadn't seen the film would think. Therefore, I would say that seeing the film makes the experience complete and enriches the music.<br /><br />A month later, I am still thinking about the music and the film together. My only cavil about this album is that I would have loved to have the 'recording' of the first song they bash together in the music shop.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|I have to agree with many others on my disappointment with this movie, glad that I saw it on my trans-atlantic flight so didn't waste a dime.    It did focus the most on Anne, especially towards the end.  I really wanted to learn more about Mary because she seems to be the forgotten sister.  I was watching with a friend and the timeline in the 2nd half of the movie went by so quickly that I had to explain most of the jumble of scenes that were happening...she had no idea what it all meant.    Definitely not one that I will be adding to my collection.
B0012Q732O|2.0|OK, I watched it. I was curious to see where things went so I watched it to the end. When it was over, I wished I had waited for it to come on television and not pay the rental fee.  It has all the classic themes: good v/s evil; them v/s us; a group can conquer most things; love will survive. Hmmmm...  The special effects were okay. The sabre tooth tiger could have been much better, but the mammoths and birds were great!   What I didn't like: historically completely out of line with vast differences in dress, language and technology... and animals for that matter. I'm suprised a phone booth didn't pop up somewhere.  The scenery was great, filming great, costumes I'm not sure about, music very good/appropriate. Acting was as good as it was gonna get.  This movie should have been geared toward children, it would definitely suit them. It does have plot, action, special effects and a moral. Who cares if it's historically incorrect? It's entertainment... at least for kids.
1878424750|5.0|The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success have a lot of good concepts to carry the listener through to the approximately hour-long recording on each of two CDs. Chopra talks about developing detachment as a way to obtain the best out of life. One of the many concepts he talks briefly about is that attachment to money will not bring about security and happiness. He doesn't go into too much detail about each of the concepts because then we'd be buying 100 CDs. He does a good job of pulling the important complicated concepts and putting them into everyday words so that I understand what he's talking about.    This CD has a lot of philosophical, abstract concepts, so I listen to it over and over to digest and apply the concepts. In terms of a practical point of view, Chopra's diction is clear and his presentation is neat and well organized.    Overall, I think this CD is worth the cost.
B0015FWRHS|5.0|Incredible! Another wonderfully masterful performance. I was first drawn to Avishai for his virtuosity but since then, he has turned into such an fantastic composer. His trio is ridiculously solid and the whole album, with all of its changes in pace and moods, is tight, tight, tight. Don't miss it!
B00006AG5N|5.0|If you own no Elvis, this is a great place to start. A sparkling collection of raw rock, pop and wail.  Songs get progressively more pop/sugar ballad down the list; the listener can feel the influence (sigh) of the market on the choice of songs.  There are some bizarre songs like \\"Wooden Heart\\", but many keepers that make the disc a real treasure. I can't help wondering what Elvis would think of the \\"Conversation\\" remix. Hmmm.
B00006CXSS|5.0|A well documented detail of history.  It brings tears to my eyes every time my husband and I watch it.
B000YDOOUK|5.0|God, this is great music.  I just got it an hour or so ago and have already played through it once, so I don't have an in depth review, but God Almighty does this kick a** in the royal tradition of the best of AC/DC.  I think after I've played it 10 times I'll still think it is better than any AC/DC since Back in Black.  I think even my 49 year old wife was diggin' it.  Rejoice!  I want more of this now. ROCK!

B0019IB26I|5.0|Although I continue to enjoy all of John Mayer's recordings... I much prefer his recent blues work... on \\"Continuum\\" and now this live set.  I have had the good fortune to see John in concert, and each of his live recordings has done an exceptional job of capturing both the energy and intimacy of his shows.      I have to disagree with a previous reviewer who hears flashes of B.B. King and Eric Clapton.  John Mayer's guitar talent is clearly influenced by the great Stevie Ray Vaughan's Texas-style blues... and equally so by the legendary Chicago blues genius Buddy Guy.    Modern blues fans must add this set to their collection, along with \\"Continuum\\" and the John Mayer Trio set.
B0017VG69U|5.0|THIS IS QUITE SIMPLY A WONDERFUL SET TO OWN IF YOU'RE REALLY A FAN OF TOS. IT HAS LOTS OF NEW EFFECTS WHICH BRING THIS SERIES TO THE LEVEL OF TNG/VOY/DS9 EPISODES WE'RE CURRENTLY ENJOYING.  GIVEN-THIS IS A 60'S SERIES, SO DON'T EXPECT MAJOR CHANGES! WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE STORIES THEMSELVES? THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE-THE BEGINNING.  THESE NEWEST DISCS ADD SOME BADLY NEEDED, RENEWED VISUAL EFFECTS AND ARE DIGITALLY REMASTERED TO LOOK A LOT CLEANER/BRIGHTER WITH VIVID COLORS AND REDUCED CONTRAST SHIFTS. THESE IMPROVEMENTS ALONE MAKE IT WORTH HAVING. THERE ARE ALSO MODEST SOUNDTRACK IMPROVEMENTS WHICH YOU'LL PROBABLY NOT EVEN NOTICE UNLESS YOU HAVE THEATRE SOUND EQUIPMENT.  PLEASE YOU GUYS... NO ONE IS MILKING ANYONE HERE! IF YOU DON'T WANT THESE IMPROVED SETS, THEN FOR GOD'S SAKE, SIMPLY DON'T BUY THEM! I'M SICK OF THE WHINING AND MOANING CRITICS WHO WANT THIS WHOLE SET TO BE HD-DVD ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER WITH STANDARD DVD.(LIKE SEASON ONE OF THESE) IT'S NOT HAPPENING FOLKS! I'M SORRY YOU BOUGHT THE HD-DVD PLAYER, BUT GROW UP AND GET OVER YOURSELF! IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD! I'M SURE THE PEOPLE AT PARAMOUNT HAVE RECIEVED YOUR THREATS OF NEVER BUYING THIS OR THE BLU RAY EDITIONS AND ARE PROSTRATE WITH GRIEF OVER THE LOSS OF THE SINGULAR PURCHASE YOU MIGHT HAVE MADE. IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD THIS RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE EXPENDITURE-BUY A PACK OF GUM INSTEAD!
B0014127BO|4.0|For a fan of Bryan Adams this release will not disappoint.  I had only heard one song from the album before buying it -- but here's the thing... I know what I'm going to get.  I buy Bryan because he always delivers great tunes - ballads -- and hits with an emotional impact an feel.    My top 5 favorite pieces from the 11 tracks include:  Track 9. \\"She's Got A Way.\\"  -- Probably the catchiest tune -- you'll be singing it hours later.  Reminds me of the vibrant nature that 18 'til I Die captured.  Track 4. \\"Oxygen.\\"   -- Great lyrics and a riff that carries you up high!  Track 5. \\"We Found What We Looking for.\\"   Track 7. \\"Somethin' to Believe In.\\"  -- Both 5 & 7 are melodic ballads with a great rhythm and passionate bass.  Track 8. \\"Mysterious Ways.\\"   -- Reminiscent of Elton Johns Rocket Man -- Bryan Adams brings a very mellow ballad into play and leaves the listener intoxicated.    Has a familiar feel to On a Day Like Today and Into the Fire.  In my opinion both albums were widely over looked... as I think some may do here too. Don't if you've enjoyed the BA catalog then this one won't disappoint. I will say the album came in at around 47 minutes... not short but I usually expect 50-60 minutes these days.    Be sure to check out the BA [....]
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Out of this world but in earth!  But you must see this in a DVD/HD player to get the best of it.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Porco Rosso is in some ways very different from other films by Miyazaki, such as Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away. In this film, the young female, while very important, is not the center. The center is the flyer Marco, who, subject to a curse, is now a pig air ace. The movie is filled with lots of aerial action, and the plot is well, typical of Miyazaki: subtle and engaging. The evolution of Marco's character is bittersweet and a delight to watch. If you like the other movies by Miyazaki, you will like this one as well.
0195067142|5.0|This book gives us an idea of how the shocking horror of the Pacific conflict turned normal guys and to-be college professors (like the author) into killers that simply didn't have the option of seeing the other side as human. When the author describes why no prisoners were taken by either side, the book has explained the mindset of the soldiers so well that it makes sense. A terrifying book, I think one of the most important books I've ever read.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|The James Bond franchise periodically changes lead actor, as fan favorites age out of the role and a new actor runs the gauntlet of high expectations.  Thus for Daniel Craig's debut as Agent 007 in 2006's \\"Casino Royale.\\"  Not only is this a new Bond, it is a reboot of the series, taking Bond back to his roots as an agent licensed to kill.<br /><br />The movie opens with a stunningly gritty retrospective showing Bond earning his 007 rating with two very ugly, messy kills.  This Bond is a relentless thug with only the thinnest veneer of the wit and charm associated with the role.  Licensed to kill, Bond is off in pursuit of a mysterious financier of terrorists named Le Chiffre.  The long chase ends at a casino in Montengro and a high stakes poker game.  Le Chiffre has speculated with other people's money; Bond, backed by M's (Judi Dench) money and by a treasury agent named Vesper Lynd, intends to bankrupt his opponent at the table.  The poker game turns into a fight to the death, at the table and outside the casino.  Bond's job will be complicated by betrayal and by his feelings for his partner.  A messy conclusion will lead directly to the next movie.<br /><br />Daniel Craig takes some getting used as Bond, but he ultimately owns the role (and has improved through two sequels).  \\"Casino Royale\\" is recommended as a successful reboot of an entertaining franchise.
0385340567|1.0|I've wasted a few hours trying to read this novel to the end.  It starts very slow and toward the end mires itself in left-wing politics, without being able to convince the reader of any plausibility to the plot.  Over the past year, I discovered and read all of Lee Child's previous books, and enjoyed them all, some more so than others.  But this one easily ranks at the bottom of the list.  One wonders why the author wrote it, and whether he let some Code Pink warrior help him with it.
B00003CXA6|5.0|A Magnificent Production! Remains true to the book on which it is based, \\"The Killer Angels.\\"
0385340567|1.0|Well, at least we now know who is on the writer staff for the DemoRat left elitist jerks....This is a true case of \\"shoulda saved that tree\\".

0374105235|2.0|FACT OR FICTION    Do a background check on the author and you'll see articles in SLATE, the NY TIMES and others in which the author's veracity is, tragically, in question.     Please don't shoot the messenger when you find some disturbing questions, and just as importantly, don't shoot the _message_.    After all, these events did take place, and it's important that we recognize and absorb them, so we can act quickly to help when they happen. (Think the Rwandan genocide, when the international community sat on the sidelines as 1,000,000 people were killed over 100 days.)    IF, however you are interested in the controversy surrounding this particular book and my take on it, read on:    CONTROVERSY     This is an important, gripping work that brings attention to some of what's happening in other parts of the world.     However ....    ... if you read-up on this author, you'll find out about  the ongoing controversy over the accuracy of events that occur in the book. (Look for articles in Slate, the New York times, among others.)    As a result, several salient points emerge:    1) Some of the work appears to have been written originally as _fiction_ with the aid of his Oberlin University Creative Writing teacher Dan Chaon, which was then changed to non-fiction.    2) Having said that, the author probably *did* experience some of what was written about in Memoirs, although to a different degree than described. How much, unfortunately we'll never know.    This means that:    3) The book contains BOTH FICTIVE AND NON-FICTIVE ELEMENTS, the fictive elements (in the Creative Writing teacher's own words, captured on tape by an Australian journalist) added as \\"poetic license.\\"    And here is where I take umbrage.    FACT VS. FICTION: WHY IT'S IMPORTANT    With the relatively-recent publication and retraction of fake biographies (such as \\"Love and Consequences,\\" a fake memoir of growing up in an L.A. gang, since discredited and pulled by the publisher), I think the blowback against this book is reasonable.    There's a REASON we have categories such as \\"fiction\\" and \\"non-fiction,\\" and why we keep them separate.     Fact is the opportunity to examine the nuances of history and its consequences, and learn something from the net result. Fiction is highly subjective, one person (or group's) untested ideas of what might be (even if the fictive work is set in the past). To blur the line is to cheapen the lessons of history.    SAY  NO TO FACT-ION    Faction has become a bit too rampant nowadays, from \\"historical movies\\" that invent unsubstantiated love affairs (think Truman Capote kissing Perry Smith in \\"Infamous,\\" or Queen Elizabeth having an historically unsubstantiated affair with Sir Walter Raleigh in \\"Elizabeth: The Golden Years,\\") to books like \\"Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,\\" which blessedly received the ridicule it deserved.    And perhaps it's true that it's the publishing houses -- or even the public's taste for only the most sensationalistic -- that are to blame, putting pressure on well-intentioned authors such as Ishmael Beah to color stories that are already horrific enough, for the sake of maximum marketability.    By all means, read and absorb Ishmael Beah's tragic story.    You can be sure some of these things happened to him, and certainly to others.    COMMERCE ABOVE ALL?    But let's start thinking about saying \\"no\\" to another machine, although one less horrific than the one Beah had to endure: the machine of sensationalism-over-truth, which encourages writers and publishers to color facts to maximize sales, thus potentially discrediting what is an important core message.
B000UR9QGW|4.0|For the past ten years I've been mighty frustrated. I'd buy an Evil Dead DVD, and 2 months later there was another, \\"better\\" version of it...mind you, a lot of them were transparent money grabs, but some were actually decent and had content I wanted. I'm tired of it, and have been for quite some time...so, I finally get a BluRay player and what a shock, \\"Evil Dead II\\" is available. Being that I'd sold off a great majority of my DVD collection to prepare for \\"the upgrade\\" I decided to pick this up because the price was right and...it's Evil Dead II...YOU HAVE TO OWN IT IN SOME FORM!<br /><br />Sure, it's the same old, recycled bonus content as the DVD releases pumped out for years, but it's all good stuff and I'm glad they didn't replace it. Sound and video are great, but didn't necessarily need the BluRay touch -- at points this looks about as good as it can on DVD. In short, this is a great addition to your collection if you don't already have it DVD (or \\"upgraded\\" like I did), but the THX-approved DVD version is probably just as good as this.<br /><br />I'd say grab this up if you're a first-time buyer or upgrading from laserdisc/VHS, but don't sweat it otherwise...I'm sure in a year there will be a mega-super-deluxe-Evil-Dead-IIray. Here's hoping THAT trend dies with this release, at least!
B00005JOFQ|3.0|The main thing I didn't understand was if these two guys really wanted to be together, why didn't they move someplace where they could be accepted?  There have been many cities that accepted gays. NY, SF, New O., Chicago, and most major cites in the north. Why not go there? If they they were gay why did they marry women?  None of this made sense to me. I remember the 60's and there were gay people who were out, and nobody cared.  I don't think the movie was a true perspective of gay life when these 2 guys got together.  It wasn't until the 80's and HIV came along that homosexuality became a big scare, and with good reason.  But back in the 60s and 70's gays were accepted in many cities.      If they wanted to ride around in the mountains, and get married, then they made their choices.  Nobody can have it all.
B0012BUX0I|5.0|This review pertains to the Triad Productions Enhanced Version of Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon.    Toshiro Mifune has appeared in more than 150 films.  Most notably are his collaborations with Akira Kurosawa.  Of the films he did with Kurosawa, Rashomon is the most prolific.  His portrayal of Tajomaru, the bandit & the central figure of Kurosawa's masterpiece is absolutely perfect.    If you are fan of Japanese Cinema or an appreciator of motion pictures; if you are a fan of Toshiro Mifune or Akira Kurosawa; you must own this film.

B00005JPNZ|1.0|i waited for almost 20 years for another jones adventure and they give us   a mindless piece of comic book action like the pirates of the carribean  movies.  harrison ford is way to old to be playing the lead anymore. please  spare me from any glowing reviews that this movie was worth watching.   don't waste your time buying this one.
B00079FUI6|5.0|It was a great season of a great show. Totally worth buying if you like a well written show, with a lot of mystery; love; comedy, drama and action. The cast is amazing and work very well together. It was a pleasant suprise to see that the acting was very good. This show is not how it appears or comes off. The comedy springs from the fact that it is written similar to a soap opera at times. Lastly, a lot of curve balls are thrown try and solve the mystery, its one fun show.
B00000DO7T|1.0|The dream cast on this recording (esp. the women) may tempt you.      Stay away from this one!!    Otto Klemperer, normally a fine conductor, takes such ridiculously slow, dragging tempi that it's painful to listen to.  It sounds like something must have been wrong with him during the recording sessions (wouldn't want to guess exactly what it was) that physically impaired him -- how sad, if I'm right.      Honestly, I have never been so disappointed with an operatic recording.       There are at least a dozen much better versions to choose from -- Jacobs, Davis, Levine, Solti, Muti, Mackerras, Haitink, Barenboim, etc. -- take your pick.      There is nothing wrong with Klempierer's other recordings that I've heard, like his Magic Flute.  I can't help wishing that someone else had conducted this Cosi.

Still glad I can get a few HD (not Blu-ray discs).

0316067601|5.0|The SAT phone used in an attempt to contact \\"HQ\\" for assistance was a Uridium SAT phone.  The company went bankrupt in 1999 (try Google search); DOD funded in excess of 300 million dollars to \\"make the company work\\" because of the ongoing contracts with the Uridium company.  It is well known, the SAT phone was poor and often did not function; the requirement to press in excess of 15 keys to connect made the task even more time consuming.<br /><br />During Operation Anaconda, the SEAL team atop Takur Ghar could not connect to Bagram AB, but had to call the duty officer in Norfolk, VA.  All this while taking fire.<br /><br />In short, DOD contributed to the disaster by not providing these outstanding Americans with the communication required.<br /><br />I know, because I used a Thuraya SAT phone during my time working in Paktia and Khwost Provinces in 2003.

B0015KO52S|4.0|I love this cd for only a couple of songs, but these songs got so deep under my skin I cant go a day without listening to them,   Many Shades Of Black-Very atmospheric song the horns add great texture to the song, it's an instant classic. Jack White Is one of the greatest guitarists out right now, and he'll be in the rock hall of fame sooner or later and Brendan's voice flowed very nicely over the music suiting it very well.    You Dont Understand Me-Smooth,relaxing, love the piano!    Five On The Five-It's hard not to love this song it's hyperactive, how   can one person have so much talent Jack White? This guy can wail on the guitar and his pipes fit songs like they were tailored.    Hold Up-A fun party song, sounds like a night out with the boys.    Pull This Blanket Off-Love It!    Buy This CD it's great!
B000ANVPPQ|1.0|I love John Wayne.  I love Maureen O'Hara.  And I love them together.  And when I first saw this movie, years ago, I loved it.  The story is rather standard, but the \\"mud bowl\\" is uproarious farce, as is most of the movie.  However, upon watching it recently, it hit me like a sledge hammer that I do not want my daughter to see this movie.  This movie, like \\"The Quiet Man\\", needs to be tossed, as I have tossed my copies.  In violent American, where FBI stats tell us that violent homes are found in every tenth house on every street in America, the spectacle of a man chasing his wife through the streets and publicly (or privately) spanking her is not funny!  Nor is the more subtle spectacle of that spanking being taken by the woman as a sign that her husband loves her.  There is no love in hitting.  There is only violence.  Any women who thinks otherwise is literally in danger for her life.  Do not let your daughter watch this movie.  It is NOT funny.

B000002KYR|5.0|First, folks at Amazon, I must point out a glaring mistake in your own review of \\"Eliminator\\" - Dusty Hill is the bassist and Frank Beard is the drummer in ZZTop.  I find that boner most annoying when you consider how big this band is.  It's like saying Keith Richards is the vocalist for the Stones.  Do your homework - it makes me want to discredit every word you wrote.<br />  That aside, after much thought, I rounded up a list of bands that have crossed the line from highly successful outfits to icons and musical institutions, an honor very few musicians will ever see.  We have to consider how the work by these artists become part of the lexicon of society, not just sell records.  This is strictly my opinion, and others will agree and disagree, but hey, it's all in fun anyway.  Those bands include the Beach Boys, especially Brian Wilson's production work, the Beatles, the Stones, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and ZZTop.<br />  Although some of their later albums didn't reach the status of \\"Eliminator\\", it wasn't because the material wasn't great, which is important when we consider the level of popularity ZZTop enjoys.  Other big bands like Aerosmith and KISS, for example, have suffered severe low points along the way, and both bands have basically regurgitated old material for years now, content to cruise on their names alone.<br />  ZZTop have not made that mistake.  \\"Eliminator\\" isn't the greatest of their career, but ranks very high, thanks to the fearless blend of the old Texas blues and synthesizers, which could have been a disaster in less capable hands.  Instead, we have anthems that will be with us forever, especially \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\", the most popular cut off this album.  \\"Gimme All Your Lovin'\\" and \\"Legs\\" follow closely behind.<br />  \\"Eliminator\\" makes a good start point for exploring the catalogue of ZZTop, both backward and forward.  Earlier works show the drenched blues and sizzling guitar of Billy Gibbons, who is a genius on the fretboard.  He comes full circle right up to \\"Mescalero\\", which is once again blues soaked but also heavily distorted, or \\"fuzzy\\", in his words.<br />  Only those lost in caves or confined to certain religious compounds are not familiar with the \\"little ol' band from Texas\\", and it's their loss.who is a genius on the fretboard.

What a dissapointment.
B000ENC6XM|5.0|I had seen this movie when it was first released and was impressed by the special effects. But with my endless quest to find hd movies (blue ray is taking over) I knew I had to purchase this one. And I am not disappointed.

Hd movies are just that, it has outstanding clarity but doesn't give that fakey look that blue ray does.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Visually everything in Wall-E is stunning.  Thankfully, Pixar has also continued its decision that technology always must serve the story rather than the other way around.  This film in fact makes it clear that Pixar sees technological hurdles as opportunities for creativity.  The company's past problems of effectively computer animating humans are sidestepped.  Real human actors play roles in video recordings from the distant past (Fred Willard as a mega-powerful CEO of the WalMart-esque Buy `n' Large chain), and the rendered humans are tremendously obese after several generations of extreme laziness (rounder surfaces being easier to render than realistic ones).    The review for families is this: Go see it.  Kids will love it, and adults will be entertained by it.  It's not as great as Pixar's or solo Disney's best, but it is very good.  Many of the scenes are just plain magical, but the movie as a whole is not.    The problem is the message.  When my brother-in-law said that he thought Wall-E was overly political for a children's film, I knew that there was some ecological message behind the film, and I knew that my brother-in-law's political views are fairly far to the right of my own.  Unfortunately, he was right.  Wall-E's politics got in the way of my enjoyment.    The `message' of Wall-E is strangely not so much about human greed destroying the planet (although that message certainly looms large in the basic plot) but about non-stop consumerism destroying human relationships.  That message (if we want to give what could be art a message) is wonderful.  It's not a cookie-cutter moral only focused on us destroying the planet.  (We've seen that since Fern Gully in 1992, and probably earlier.)  This film goes so far as to speak to the way that overconsumption destroys our human connections with one another.  And it's right.    But what about the mouthpiece?  Wall-E is an anti-consumerist message from the Walt Disney Corporation, a message which cost $120M and which was made solely in order to earn another $500M or more domestically.  This movie, which begins and ends on an Earth covered almost entirely with junk, is certain to continue to fill the earth's landfills with cheap plastic movie tie-ins.  And while I wrestled with whether I should just accept the basic message, with which I basically agreed, while disregarding the corporate juggernaut of a messenger, ultimately there was a line that Disney crossed.  There at the very end of the credits ran this ad: \\"In stores now on your favorite gaming systems.\\"    --------------------------------    This also seems to be the best place to review the short at the beginning of the film, \\"Presto\\".  As a die-hard Looney Tunes fan, I admit I get skeptical any time a Disney cartoon stars a rabbit.  In this case, my initial skepticism was justified.  As the short progressed, I was reminded that there actually is a Bugs Bunny cartoon in which Bugs works his revenge on a magician who is using him in his act.  And it's much better than this.  The basic gag of the two connected magic hats is really funny, I'll admit, but the timing is straight from Looney Tunes.  Unfortunately, while this could be an homage, it feels like a rip-off.

B00006AW2J|5.0|This legendary album was hailed both by critics and Stones fans alike whom consider it one of the very best efforts of their illustrious careers, although commercially it would be the worst performing record of the 24 albums issued between 1963 and 2005 reaching only #5 on the charts.  Although it sounds absurd now, it was also considered a comeback by a band that at the time appeared doomed after their previous album Their Satanic Majesties Request was the weakest of their career and several members of the band were involved in high profile drug arrests and the band's founder Brian Jones sank further into the morass of drugs.  Furthermore, the band had not toured since 1966, an eternity back in that era, mostly due to issues related to the decline of Jones.  The band was also nearly bankrupt due to a combination of a terrible recording contract, lack of touring, outrageous tax rates in England at the time and excessive spending on their part.    Against this beak backdrop and behind the scenes the band was about to rebound to spectacular creative heights over the next 4 years that would forever give them deserving claim to \\"The Greatest Rock `N Roll Band in the World\\".  Mick Jagger would maintain his wild image, but behind the scenes he gave up drugs and smoking and reverted to his roots of exercising regularly as taught by his Phys-Ed instructor dad.   In an interview in the 1990s Jagger said \\"I was too smart to fall victim to drugs\\".      He also became a voracious reader of scores of classic novels, and spent hours learning how to play guitar, both of which had a profound effect on his song writing ability.    It would no longer be Jagger exclusively writing the lyrics and Keith Richards exclusively writing the music.  The band also marginalized Jones' involvement as he had become a liability.  Between mid '68 and mid '69 they recorded 25-30 songs, many of which would ultimately be among the greatest Rock `N Roll songs of all time.  The songs would be divided into 2 albums, 2 separate singles, and another classic that would be released on a later album.  Jagger later explained that Beggar's Banquet and Let It Bleed were recorded over the same extended 12 months of recording.  It was decided that for the most part, the songs that were predominantly acoustic would be on Beggar's Banquet and the songs that were predominantly electric would be on Let It Bleed.  For example, \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" was one of the first songs recorded and was played live in '68 at the Rolling Stones Rock `N Roll Circus, but its release was delayed (with a boy's chorus intro added) until the fall of '69 on Let It Bleed.  That is why Brian Jones and his replacement Mick Taylor both appear on Let It Bleed.       It was also decided, in a rare promotional blunder by the Stones, that \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" would be left off of Beggar's Banquet and instead would be only available as a single, preceding the release of the album.  JJF was an instant hit (#3 on the singles chart) and is unquestionably an all time rock classic.  Critics and fans hailed that the Stones were back and \\"they had returned to their roots\\".   Jagger disputes that saying that yes it was a turn away from the psychedelic failure of Their Satanic Majesties Request and the Pop sound of Between the Buttons, but in fact it was quite unlike any song they had done before.  It was not psychedelic or Pop, but is was also not blues based rock like many of their earlier recordings, it was pure Rock `N Roll.  The release of the single was complimented for the first time with a music video that was seen by few due to censorship because as Richards says \\"it was a pretty wicked video\\".  Also absent from the record would be the classic \\"Sister Morphine\\" that was delayed until Sticky Fingers in 1971 because Jagger's ex girlfriend Marianne Faithful had made claims she wrote the song.    Despite the absence of these songs, and the relative poor sales for the album, Beggar's Banquet is a landmark album.  The opening song \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" is musically and lyrically unlike any song ever written and is on everyone's top 10 all time rock songs.  Another hard rock classic, and perhaps the only hard rock acoustic classic, was Street Fighting Man, a reflection of the student riots taking place on both sides of the Atlantic at the time.  The remaining tracks are acoustic songs that have never gotten radio play then or now, but every one of them is a hidden gem.  There is the soulful ballad \\"No Expectations\\" and the cleverly comical country influenced songs \\"Dear Doctor\\" and \\"Factory Girl\\".  There is the \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" antithesis redemption in the Jesus parable from the Bible \\"Prodigal Son\\" followed by the savagely hard rock \\"Stray Cat Blues\\", which was easily the hardest edge rock song recorded at that point in time and is one of the top 10 most underrated songs ever.  Have you ever heard it on the radio?  \\"Jig Saw Puzzle\\" and \\"Salt of the Earth\\" with Richards singing the intro, are exclamation points for this masterpiece in which the Stones took acoustic songs well beyond the usual background sound for soft rock ballads.      So why was it tied with Now! (1964) as the poorest charting Stones album in their careers?  To this day it has barely sold 1 million copies compared to the nearly 8 million copies of Some Girls (1978).  There are multiple reasons, the hit \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" was not included, it followed the much high charting Satanic (#2) which disappointed most buyers, the original bathroom graffiti album cover was rejected by the record company and instead they went with a bland white jacket, albums that are primarily acoustic don't sell well (for example Led Zeppelin III and Pink Floyd's Meddle) and lastly the album was not promoted/backed by a tour.  An example of the reaction is documented in Bill Wyman's book in which members of the Stones and Beatles were at the same party.  Jagger played an advance copy of \\"Sympathy\\" and themuted reaction by the partygoers were that it was \\"cool\\" and \\"unique\\", then Paul McCarthy put on an advance of \\"Hey Jude\\" and all the hippest of the hip flower children of the day got much more excited and all \\"oohed\\" and \\"aahed\\" about how great it was.      Despite the lack of sales, I rank this album surely in their top 10 and close to the top 5.  I will note that many \\"hardcore Stones fans\\" typically rate it in their top 3 or 4.  Maybe if \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" were included I would have rated it as high.  Regardless, it is a must have Masterpiece.

B0000025ZF|1.0|This first solo album by Waters is largely unlistenable.  The concept is a nightmare but the real nightmare is if you are a huge Floyd fan like myself who believes Waters was the mastermind behind it all and you loved the Final Cut and then you have your high expectations crushed by this dismal effort.  Roger simply talks for 40 minutes with a cacophony of miscellaneous sounds in the background that I guess is called music.  Rock legend Eric Clapton is totally wasted here.  There are no melodies, rhythm or beat, just nothing.  The title song is funny but really just a novelty song like Frank Zappa.  From there it is all down hill.  I am a huge Waters fan, but I am not obsessed with him like the other 100 reviewers here who to quote Waters himself would rave about the sound of a dripping faucet if it had his name on it and was put out for sale.  Keep that in mind as you read the 100 positive reviews here.  Radio Kaos is the best of his 3 solo efforts, but even it has weakened over time.  Floyd is nothing without Waters and Waters is nothing without Gilmour, the sum was much greater than the parts.
B00164DWEA|2.0|Yes, there's more action in this movie. For some that may be all the recommendation they'll need for \\"The Incredible Hulk,\\" the sequel/franchise reboot to Oscar winner Ang Lee's film that underperformed at the box office a few years ago. That film was denounced by uneducated film viewers (AKA: teenagers) as being a slow, action-less film that could have used more Hulk in it. Well, this new film does contain more Hulk. More Hulk, more CGI, and more action. Midway through the film you'll feel as though you were watching a video game that you could no longer control. But let's start at the beginning. In keeping with their promise to rebuild the franchise into something that has a better box office life-span, the director opens the movie with the origin of the Hulk.<br /><br />The origin is rushed and oversimplified to a great extent, but then the film makers have lots of action sequences they want to get to. So the movie opens with Bruce Banner (Edward Norton, who replaces Eric Bana) living in Brazil (even though the last we saw Hulk was in Africa), working in a soda factory and trying to cure himself of the Hulk blood that runs through his veins. So paranoid is Bruce that he takes up self-meditation and wears a heartbeat tracker, which leads to an awkwardly funny moment later on in the film when there is the potential for sex on the horizon. Since the movie is more about action then it is about story though, we all know Bruce can't stay safe in the haven he's created. Not long after that General Ross (William Hurt replacing the wonderful Sam Elliot) finds out where Bruce is and orders an attack on the guy.<br /><br />So the military tries getting him in Brazil. Then at a college university. Then in the middle of the city. As this went on I was wondering whether or not the general had some superiors of his own to answer to. Surely the government does not approve of hostile military force on home and foreign soil, all blowing things up relentlessly without any foreseeable results? Well, results or not, none of this registered with me because I've spent most of my life watching movies where cities get destroyed, that to simply destroy things without an ounce of style or wit seems like a futile effort. Watching a clown make balloon animals would be more interesting at this point. But alas, the movie is not content to let Hulk fight the army itself, and so the army reveals that they want the Hulk's DNA to create their own line of super human soldiers (foreshadowing for the Captain America movie maybe?).<br /><br />The result is that the Army ends up creating the Abomination, an ugly...something or other that's just as big, just as mean, and just as fake looking as the Hulk. So, of course, the two have to fight each other creating what will likely be the fakest looking climax of the summer. The ending to the last Harry Potter film looked more realistic then this, and that had wizards, lizards, and sprites in it. Okay, so the creators obviously wanted to steer the franchise away from Ang Lee's somber affair and sell this as an action movie. I can understand that. Lee's \\"Hulk\\" was certainly a more sophisticated effort, one that required more patience then the average superhero movie, and I knew it would be a tough sell once word-of-mouth got out on how little action there really was in the film.<br /><br />But geez, did they have to simplify the film THIS MUCH!?! \\"Hulk\\" may not have been a very loved film, but at least it was ABOUT something! Bruce Banner was an interesting character who struggled with his curse, and even admitted he fears it because he likes it so much (a metaphor used by alcoholics). This Bruce describes his experience with the words a hippie might use to describe being high. Lee's \\"comic book\\" style of film, where boxes and lines made the movie look like a living comic book, has been excused for a more straightforward approach to filming. Therefor the look of the film is typical and average.<br /><br />Getting rid ofJennifer Connely as Betty Ross was a big mistake, as Liv Taylor does nothing interesting with the role. The same goes with replacing Sam Elliot with William Hurt as the General. Hurt should have been good in this role, but he looks like he's making a kids movie or something (then again...maybe he is). Does any of this really matter? I have to be honest: I have no idea. Yeah, this smells like box office success, but I just get the feeling that it's going to be a small victory. As time has gone by, Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\" was starting to develop a cult following of people who were growing up, and now appreciating the complexity of the story. \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" on the other hand feels like the B movie of the week: lots of actions, instant gratification, and something you won't even remember by the time the next special effects powerhouse comes out.<br /><br />Rating: ** starsg mistake, as Liv Taylor does nothing interesting with the role.

B00177Y9ZC|3.0|All in all I liked this movie, but something about it has bothered me since I saw it.  I just couldn't figure out what.  Now I know. There is nearly no story line!!     1. All of a sudden this boy became a \\"jumper\\".  2. All of a sudden he encounters another \\"jumper\\".  3. All of a sudden he and this other \\"jumper\\" are being chased by someone.  4. And all of a sudden it's supposedly over....    That's pretty much it. Theres no history of where the \\"jumpers\\" come from or how they evolved.  Supposedly this is a thousand years long war, but how or why is it a secret? Where did the Paladins come from? His mother knows what he is and just leaves without telling him how to protect himself? Basically, I can sit and watch this without thinking and give it a 5, but when my intellect steps in and things stop making sense I can only give it a 3.
B0015XHQTY|2.0|Third Dirty Harry picture feels more dated than the previous two with its portrait of crazed radicals as the bad guys none of whom register as believable or menacing villains. The picture feels more like a violent TV episode from the era.  Like in Magnum Force, Harry is made into more of a conventional cop hero than the extreme personality from the first (and far and away best) film.  The whole show here is his relationship with Tyne Daly as his partner.  These scenes are the best in the movie and both actors deliver.
B00006L3S3|5.0|Wow.  People kept telling me to avoid John Lennon's Mind Games album, but I really am glad I didn't listen to any of them (no offense!)    The album cover is really great to me.  I love it.  I can sit there all day and look at just the cover alone, with the gigantic face looking straight up into the sky.  A dreamy picture that one is.  I've had dreams just like it, in fact.      Anyway, the music. The fantastic music!  Obviously we won't find any songs as meaningful or powerful as \\"Imagine\\", but the title song, \\"Out the Blue\\", and Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)\\" are really top notch quality songs.  I have no idea why so many people love the title song while ignoring a good part of the rest of it, claiming it's just inferior to the music Lennon has done in the past, or Lennon was going through a stage where he wasn't coming up with enough creative ideas, or whatever.      Other places you can find the lyrically memorable \\"Bring on the Lucie\\" (trust me, you'll remember the lyrics) and blues rock \\"Tight As\\", which sounds much different from the rest of the album.  There's also a couple short, upbeat poppy songs with great lyrics (\\"Intuition\\" and \\"Only People\\").  Perhaps my favorite song from Mind Games (besides the title song) is \\"I Know (I Know)\\".  Hard to believe this song wasn't a major hit.   Listen to the way John pours his honest emotions into this one.  I once again have to mention \\"Out the Blue\\".  I truly love this song as well.      The only problem is \\"One Day (At A Time)\\".  It's not a bad song.  In fact, it's quite brilliant.  It's just I prefer Elton John's version more.  This version is quite mellow and laid back in comparison.    Yeah, the stuff on here is *slightly* worse (and quite mellow in spots) but it's really a rather enjoyable listening experience overall and worth owning.

Grab you by the throat lyrics. Alanis remains a cut above. She's been away too long. Check out \\"Madness\\" if you doubt her skill set. Thank you Alanis. Ryan's a fool!
B00000AOUD|5.0|When I first bought this album on LP record, I didn't like it.  I took it over to my younger brother's house to play and told him I didn't like it.  He was surprised.  He played it.  I left it over his house and every time I'd go there, he'd play it.  Gradually, the album got into my blood and I think I bought about 3 or 4 copies of it because I played it so much.      I taped it and played it every day on my way to and from work.  That was sometime in the '70's and today, I have it on CD and also made a tape of it that I play in the car.  I think it's the kind of album that you have to play a while until it gets into your blood.  I especially like the ending of Side I where he sings: \\"I see you shuffle in the courtroom with your rings upon your fingers and your downy little sidies and your silver-buckle shoes.  Playing at the hard case, you follow the example of the comic-paper idol who lets you bend the rules.\\"  (Words in quotes by Ian Anderson and Gerald Bostock from Thick As A Brick.)     On side II, it seems like they wasted some time before they really got into it, but once they did, it was a masterpiece.  I have often said, that if they let me take 2 albums with me when I pass from this earth, it's going to be \\"Thick As A Brick\\" and \\"A Passion Play,\\" both by Jethro Tull.
B000063UR2|1.0|The special effects were some of the best I have ever seen in any movie. Yet the acting by Tom Cruise was just downright awful. The plot was kind of shallow. Not a whole lot to the story either.
B00008G9JM|5.0|I originally bought this LP album when it came out in 1973.  Then eventually I bought the CD of it.  I love the beginning of this album which starts off with a great instrumental piece.  (Anderson used this same instrumental when he sang a song about a tiger on Nightcap.  I don't know which came first, though.)      Up to this point I had never seen Tull in concert and \\"A Passion Play\\" was the first time I saw them, right in Madison Square Garden.  Before they came on, my younger brother asked me why I was so nervous?  I told him that the critics had trashed the album and I was afraid the crowd might start booing them.  He laughed and told me, \\"Don, these are all Tull fans here.  They could care less what the critics have to say IF they even read their reviews.\\"  So, I relaxed.      They played the entire album non-stop.  After the opening instrumental, it takes them some time to get things together, going from one melody to another.  I particularly like Side II, after Jeffrey Hammond Hammond gets done with \\"The Hair Who Lost His Spectacles.\\"  There are four sections pieced together that are as good as anything Tull has ever done.  My favorite piece is about 2/3rds of the way through in which he opens up with:  \\"Flee thee icy Lucifer, oh he's an awful fellow.  What a mistake, I didn't take, a feather from his pillow.\\"  Then: \\"Here's the everlasting rub: neither am I good nor bad.  I'd give up my halo for a horn and the horn for the hat I once had.\\"  (Lyrics in quotes by Ian Anderson from \\"A Passion Play.\\")  Now what is so difficult about understanding those lyrics?  But to the critics, those lyrics were too \\"obscure.\\"      After doing the entire album, Tull performed a large section of \\"Thick As A Brick\\" and then went off stage before coming back for an encore.    After that they did several songs from Aqualung.  One thing I'll say about Jethro Tull is that they always present you with a great show.  One oddity about that show was when we spotted a N.Y.C. policemansitting down on the steps smoking weed.  LOL!  I guess he got into it too.  Other than that, all I can say is if you haven't bought \\"A Passion Play\\" by now, then you've missed out on a great piece of music.      I had hoped that Tull would continue with the full-length albums, but I think because of the critics, they went back to doing regular songs on their next album \\"War Child.\\"  The closest they ever came to doing a continuous piece of music was on Side II of \\"Minstrel In The Gallery\\" in which they performed \\"Baker Street Muse.\\"                Again I say, when I pass from this earth and they tell me I can take any two albums with me, it'll be \\"Thick As A Brick\\" and \\"A Passion Play\\" my two all-time favorites.
B00005K3NR|5.0|CARRIE was an excellent and very popular horror film of 1976 which earned four or five stars in my book. This DVD is a good clear transfer and has several very good documentaries on the making of the film, casting, and special effects. It is a must buy for all Steven King fans who wish to own one of his most well done and successful story transfers to the screen.<br /><br />At the risk of taking the film plot too seriously I offer the following comments: I had never read the book and was very surprised when Carrie reacted as violently as she did to that dirty trick. Up until the ending she was portrayed as such a sympathetic and mild character that she really surprised me at the end of the story. She thoughtlessly did away with the innocent as well as the guilty and I couldn't help but notice that her telekinetic powers gave her no insights into the behavior of those around her. She never even looked down or offered a helping hand to her well meaning date Tommy, and allowed him to burn along with all the other well intentioned characters that attended her prom and were not in on that dirty joke in any way.<br /><br />I guess this gave the screen writers license to subject her and her poor demented mother to the most horrible final fate when they were creamated in that spectacular house fire and collapsed into the Earth. I have been told that back in the days of the early Universal horror movies if a character was guilty of \\"murder\\" they absolutely had to die at the end of the film. Carrie certainly paid the ultimate price for her violent revenge.  Of course, if Carrie had done something less spectacular it wouldn't have been much of a horror story.
0307394549|5.0|Aside from very good recipes, I particularly like a section in the front where you'll find a photo of each cookie. They are listed by type, i.e. cripy, chewy, etc. It makes it very easy to select a recipe by texture or ingredients. My only regret is that the book is not hardcover, my personal preference for all cookbooks.
0553381687|5.0|First off, I'm not a big fan of fantasy, give me science fiction any day.  I read Lord of the Rings with mild enthusiasm and managed to drudge myself through Eddings' two Sparhawk trilogies, The Elenium and The Tamuli.  My brother even let me borrow the first book in The Wheel of Time, which I couldn't get further than 150 pages before giving it back.<br /><br />With that said, A Game of Thrones had me hooked, reading at all hours in the night (to the annoyance of my wife), even on a second read.  Even if you are not a fan of fantasy I highly recommend trying this book.  It also has one of the most rememberable endings, only second to Ender's Game.<br /><br />The character development is like no other series, the many different plots and viewpoints are riveting and strongest of all, it's unpredictable.  These books have a sense of realism that no other series has because all the characters are succeptable to death, regardless if they are primary characters or secondary.  Another unique aspect of this series is you get the perspective of characters on either side of the conflict, so there is no clear cut good and bad (or if there is, you will find yourself cheering for the wrong side on occasion).<br /><br />Now it's true that the 2nd and 3rd books are equally good reads, but the 4th book you will have to push yourself to get through.  It's slow, it's tedious, and it only follows one of the big characters while all the other most favorable characters are left for A Dance with Dragons.<br /><br />Like readers giving JK Rowling a break for The Half-Blood Prince, Martin easily gets a pass for A Feast for Crows. . .  As long as Dance is everything we are hoping it will be.
0670020745|3.0|The Illustrations are very, very,disappointing. The thesis of the book is excellent - that it is possible (though not common) after a stroke to experience a persistent state of wonder, bliss, transcendence and epiphany akin to the religious 'grace' or 'nirvana.' It follows that such religious states are entirely brain-based in origin. The neurobiology explanations will be tedious to anyone with even a modicum of neuro education. Hopefully this book will further contribute to taking the mystery out of mysticism.
B0018AK9RK|3.0|Wow! There are already so many reviews on this concept CD and it has only just been very recently released! This goes to show: 1) just how popular The Priest are and 2) how compelled JP fans are to comment on this new and different Priest sound. I certainly don't expect everyone, or even most people, to agree with everything I say here, but as a true Priest die-hard, I feel compelled to say it.    Having read many of the reviews, I purchased this CD with the intention of keeping an open mind. I love my Priest with a passion, and wanted so very much to embrace this release. Having given the CD four listens now, I am quite on the fence. I grew up, as did so many other reviewers, with classic Priest (British Steel, Screaming For Vengeance, Point of Entry). The addictive, hard-driving rhythms and Rob Halford's amazing vocal range were both unique and wonderful. I was a total 'Priesthead' and was hooked for life.     As the group forged into the late '80s and on through the '90s, it morphed into more of a speed-metal band. The sound was unmistakably Priest, yet a bit less 'tuneful' or 'melodic'. Much heavier. Almost like grunge on steroids. Still, with releases such as 'Ram it Down' and 'Painkiller', I grew to embrace this new brand of Priest metal. I didn't like it quite as much as the classic Priest metal sound, but it grew on me and, after all, it was still Judas Priest!     I am going to skip over the years without Halford. To me, his vocal style is what made JP who they are and, even though some of their offerings during this time were high quality, it just wasn't Judas Priest to my ear. Not without the unique vocal talents of Halford.     Thankfully, RH returned to the fold and the band switched gears yet again with their 'Angel of Retribution' album. Very dark and less 'speed-metalish', and very heavy. Once again, I was being asked to embrace a different sound, but I did so with relish. What a great CD! I especially loved 'Lochness'. Halford was back!!     Forwardto their new CD 'Nostradamus'. Yet again, a different sound from my favorite band of all-time. This was getting to be a bit like having a girlfriend who kept changing her personality and asking that I continue to love her despite her many mood swings! As I mentioned, I have listened to this new CD from top to bottom four times now, and I'm still not sure whether I like it or not.     Let me rephrase that... I do like it. It is a bit easier to accept the newest Priest sound, probably because I have been asked to do so several times already and have been able to adapt. I will say, however, that had any other band put out this album, I don't think I would like it very much. I am a fan of classical music, so that's not the issue. The fusion of different sounds and music types is very interesting and, in some cases, impressive, but.. I don't know. I have kept a very open mind throughout all of JP's new directions and have been able to embrace and enjoy the music. But Nostradamus is different. I mean REALLY different. I love some tracks, but there are a couple that I just can't sit and listen to for very long. I have given them every chance but I just don't care for them. I know that statement alone will likely bring on a few negative votes from dedicated Priest fans (of which I am one, BTW) but I have to be honest with you. I'm not a sycophant who thinks that anything Judas Priest spits out is great merely because it's Judas Priest (although it sure helps!!). If I think something isn't very good, I will say so. In this case, there is a mix of brilliant new songs and, to be brutally honest, a few yawners.     I will be listening to this CD again and hopefully I will be able to write a subsequent review giving it 4 stars. For now, though, it gets between 2-1/2 and 3 stars. I need time for this one to grow on me.     Peace.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|What a bliss! The QUEEN (or should it be Empress by now?) is back! Four decades of music and songs she provided us. Mostly co-written or written by Miss Summer herself. This album stands out as a wonderful up-to-date piece of work. Again Donna Summer have proved herself as one of the most important vocalists! This album shows again that Donna can do anything she musically wants. It's incredible to see that she's still in control! What an artist, what a voice! Well....... what to add more...<br /><br />Of course I'm a fan since Donna's disco days, but I always admired her for using different 'colors' and musical directions to keep us surprised. We remember the albums THE WANDERER, I'M A RAINBOW, MISTAKEN IDENTITY, CHRISTMAS SPIRIT etc. So this new album adds to the flavour.<br /><br />To electronic? Well... ever heard I FEEL LOVE, OUR LOVE, NOW I NEED YOU? If any artist liked to experiment... Donna was! Always ahead of everybody else. Remember the reactions Brian Eno and David Bowie made on I FEEL LOVE... it was 1976!<br /><br />Not Donna's Disco? Is an artist a good one if she/he sticks to a few masterpieces or genres only? Or is real artist one who paved the way to new areas, new grounds, new experiences? The masterpieces of Donna's disco days are musical milestones now. But to re-copy them? Let other singers do that stuff. Donna Summer have already proved herself during the disco days and there is too much quality stuff out of that period that it would be dull to make more! Let Donna go on!<br /><br />But ok.... it's FOUR decades now, and Donna refuses to stop and limit herself to disco alone. This album shows her kaleidoscopic skills. Wonderful. A good addition and developement to her earlier work. Sad that it took so long (17 years) to complete it, but it was worth the wait. And Donna deserves to be waiting for. What a class and uncomparable! Stylisch and with a good spirit. That's the Donna we learned to know during the last 40 years. Let's hope she keep us wondering and suprised. She cannot be missed in the global musical minds of music lovers.<br /><br />P.S. the pictures on this album are wonderful. Photoshopped? Well, what's NOT photoshopped or corrected these days.... would you look so good after a photoshop session?? (joking).be missed in the global musical minds of music lovers.

0062502182|1.0|My book club choose this: it was so bad, I stayed home so I wouldn't hurt the hostess's feelings. Hated it: reminded me of Jonathan Livingstone Seagull. I like business self-help books, in moderation, but nothing in here struck me a relevent.
B00007FOMP|5.0|Wow. When it comes to an album like What's Going On, it's easy to become jaded. Critics have been praising this thing since the day of its conception, have been hailing it as a masterpiece since before you even knew how to read, have apparently been putting it on a pedestal since before Marvin Gaye was born.  It gets old after a while. It's the kind of album that becomes clich&eacute; before you even hear it, that's the kind of thing you can have a conversation about even if you don't own a copy. It's the Dark Side Of The Moon of soul.<br /><br />Well, I have some advice for you: If you don't already own a copy, buy one right now. Put on some headphones. Turn the volume up. Close your eyes. Listen. And fly away. This album has an entire world in it, a world of wah-wah guitars and moaning strings and divine horns and mind-enveloping percussion. It's a world of textures and feelings. Emotion bleeds out of every gorgeous layer of sound, radiates from every nook and cranny. It's the kind of thing you can swim in. Listen: There's joy, despair, anguish, hope, suffering, pain, beauty. There's life in it. The critics were right on the money with this one.
0142403873|5.0|I bought this book on an Amazon recommendation looking for reading material for my 8 yr old nephew. Not only does he love it and enjoy reading it, turns out my 2 yr old niece loves it just as much too. There are lots of pictures balanced with words to keep her attention and an entertaining story to keep his. It is the favorite book of the summer for both of them. A huge hit.
B000002UAR|5.0|There's a reason why Revolver is a personal favorite for many Beatles fans: Sgt. Pepper may have been more innovative, and Abbey Road may be more pleasantly scatterbrained, but Revolver has better songs. It has \\"Taxman,\\" which is one of the group's coolest numbers, what with that neat chord progression and those smug lyrics and the guitar solo that just screams \\"1966.\\" It has \\"Here, There And Everywhere,\\" one of the finest pop songs of all time (it was, after all, Paul's famous attempt to top Brian Wilson). It has the delirious rock classic that is \\"She Said She Said,\\" and the languid beauty of \\"I'm Only Sleeping.\\" \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" laid the groundwork for power pop with its sky-scraping melody and jangling guitars. \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" will rip your brain in half.<br /><br />Even the throwaways are fun: \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" and \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" are catchy and silly and soulful, and \\"Doctor Robert\\" is a fantastic poker-faced drug anthem. \\"I Want To Tell You\\" is worthwhile for its swooping fade-in, if nothing else.<br /><br />Plus, Revolver is just plain cooler than most of the Beatles other albums. While Sgt. Pepper's often (let's be honest here) got a bit too silly for its own good, Revolver always sounded like futurist pop art with a genuinely rockin' backbone. It was playful, but it was also smart and hip. It knew how to hold experimental tendencies in check when necessary. As such, Revolver has aged much better than most of the other \\"cutting edge\\" recordings of the 60s. It still sounds fresh and hip and exciting. Don't believe me? Buy it and see for yourself. You won't be sorry.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I am loving Third SO much! I'm so glad I decided to give it a chance even though I wasn't convinced by some of the 30 second snippets. There is one track that I'm not crazy about, but the rest are wonderfully crafted, beautiful and yet surprising to the ear in so many ways. I listened to Third for the first time at the gym, all the way through, and wasn't totally in love from the first listen, as there was a lot to absorb and take in. Even so, I was too intrigued to want to fast forward through any of the tunes. By the second listen, I was hooked. I felt like I had experienced something that touched my emotions while stimulating my rational mind as well. If you like music that is (at least somewhat) experimental yet beautiful, and not afraid to tread paths not considered stereotypically beautiful, give this a try! If you are the type of person who can sit and listen to an album all the way through uninterrupted and enjoy the twists and bends, highs and lows in the music, then you will love this album. In other words, can you sit back and meditate and let something new come to you and just experience it without judging it, letting its brilliance occur to you slowly and over time? If not, and if you'd rather be able to have your music fit into a pre-set mold of your own conception that fits with your past experience of music you've loved, then you may not like this. Seriously, beautiful work! Well done, Portishead!
B00026WU82|5.0|He's made too many great albums to count, but rarely has Bob Dylan ever managed to top the psychotic hillbilly proto-psychedelic rock `n' roll dreamscape masterpiece that is Highway 61 Revisited. There are plenty of reasons for that: For one thing, the record is soaked in raw energy and electrified excitement. As the first complete rock `n' roll album of Dylan's career, Highway 61 Revisited bristles with palpable enthusiasm, the sense of gleefully leaping into the void, of playing around with new sounds and textures, without any particular regard for the feelings or traditions or opinions of others.<br /><br />It's also a display of Dylan's genius at its absolute zenith. His songwriting is phenomenal, full of backwoods surrealism and backalley melodies. As a performer, he's rarely been as inspired as he is here: He's hilarious and angry and poetic and visceral. His vocals are full of emotion and detachment. He's cynical and big-hearted all at once. He's insane and cool and intellectual. He's giddy and lethargic and everything in between. The music's great, too. Lots of bluesy guitars and throbbing organs and undulating rhythms. It's garage rock, but with a higher purpose. It's sheer genius.
B00177Y9ZM|5.0|Absolutely love this movie!!! Great extras!! Digital copy a breeze to put onto your computer!
B000000W5L|5.0|Rock `n' roll as it was meant to be played: Loose, ragged, raw, and emotive. Exile On Main Street is fun. It's sexy. It's rough and chaotic. It's depressed and jubilant, nervous and uninhibited, tense and cathartic all at once. Blood and sweat and booze drip from its walls. It boogies and hops and screams. It's the sound of a great band going for broke, throwing themselves into every song, into every lick, into every note, every moment of music. It speaks to every aspect of this whole \\"human experience\\" thing we've got going. It communicates joy and misery. It's here to help us celebrate the good times and dance the bad times into bloody submission. It's here to help turn our boring days into raucous nights. The Rolling Stones are here to save the world with rock `n' roll. Play it loud.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Pixar has produced some of the best animation in the past decade with its computer-generated features (Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo) that have been marked by strong storylines and vivid characters.  The tradition continues in an impressive way with Wall-E.  This deceptively simple tale is transformed by the emotional content told almost entirely through visuals.      A polluted Earth has become uninhabitable for 700 years, and one of its only residents is Wall-E, a small robot whose solitary mission is to be a mobile, trash compactor. In his work, he also finds and collects trivial, odd artifacts of mankind's past such as a Rubik's cube.  He comforts himself with an old video, Hello Dolly, and as he learns about humans and his yearning for love, it becomes his idyllic vision of happiness amid an insulated, dull existence.  Along his travels, he comes across a unique find, a live plant! One day a spaceship lands and deposits a robot probe.  Fascinated by this kindred machine, Wall-E follows and eventually befriends this unit known as Eve.  Eve has a directive that will hopefully return humans to Earth if only it can sustain life, and Wall-E's plant figures immeasurably.  Eve is returned to her mother ship with Wall-E frantically chasing after his newly found love.  On a spaceship acting as a living city for its machine-dependent, overweight humans, little robots are not only the caregivers, but in control.  Wall-E and Eve must figure a way to return the humans to earth and find happiness even if it means making the ultimate sacrifice.    Wall-E's innocence and childlike wonder (think E.T.), as exemplified by how he introduces himself to everyone he meets, could almost have sprung from Steven Spielberg's imagination.  It's in the small details that enrich Wall-E as a character.   He brings to mind an amalgam of past robots like Star Wars' R2-D2 and the little robots in Silent Running, and his fears and joys are expressed through body language and squeals. When he shuts down each night to sleep, he rocks himself as a child would.  He is clumsy around Eve, and when he takes her to his makeshift home of robot parts and paraphernalia, he is like a little kid.  Ironically, he is the catalyst to bring the humans back home.         Writer and director, Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo), takes a huge risk by basing the film's premise almost entirely on a song from Hello Dolly.  I can't think of an animated film that relied so much on visual storytelling.  Even Fantasia and Allegro Non Troppo were collections of musical sequences not narrative features.  In a way, this film is almost too sophisticated in its display and execution for little kids but is just right for adults.  Remarkably, this is a tale with nary a spoken word by the principals. One has to think of silent films to approach this achievement.  The operative word here is pathos like the best of Charlie Chaplin's little tramp and, amazingly, this film earns its stripes by emoting body language, action, and sound effects. Yet most of the characters aren't even human!      Fred Willard has an amusing small role as the corporate president.  Sigourney Weaver, as the ship's computer voice, is an inspired choice since, like Eve, she was a female hero (in the Alien movies) and had to deal with computer voices in those films.  The animation is almost 3-D in its rich detail and simulated, fluid camerawork.  The interior of the mother ship, the Axiom, is a futuristic view of a commercialized (think Blade Runner) city in space.      Yes, it is a thinly veiled message for all those `save the earth' and `think green' people, but that never detracts from the main theme of saving humanity amid a touching love story.  There are moments when you think a scene could have played out a bit better, but that is minor.  It is likely that Wall-E's reputation will grow over time as a shining example of stretching the art form by challenging and trusting its audience.  Bravo to the folks atPixar for taking a chance and for entertaining and moving us.
B00005ASHM|5.0|It's a very beautiful album. Brian Wilson had a knack for making symphonic pop music, and on Pet Sounds he lets that knack run hog wild. His orchestrations are large and complex. Instruments are layered on top of each other, bellowing hypnotic labyrinths of melody with majestic energy. The melodies are gorgeous, too: evocative, dreamy, surreal, memorable, and intricate. They express emotions, they create images, and they stick with the listener. They're wonderfully conceived and flawlessly executed. The orchestration conveys them rather than swallows them up. The music sounds powerful rather than pretentious. Brian wasn't full of it when he talked about making \\"teenage symphonies to God.\\" This stuff gives Phil Spector a run for his money.<br /><br />But even though it feels like a symphony in 13 movements, Pet Sounds succeeds because of its individual songs. The best ones are little slices of magic: \\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)\\" is impossibly beautiful, so beautiful that it can make your heart stop. \\"That's Not Me\\" does a crackerjack job of invoking youthful angst and longing. \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" is one of the most exuberant pieces of music ever created.<br /><br />Really, the only misfire is \\"Sloop John B,\\" which is cheesy and a little bit annoying. Everything on this album is pleasant, if nothing else. The best moments are virtually perfect.
B000002ULO|4.0|I have been discovering Paul's post-Beatle work mostly in reverse order, starting with \\"Memory Almost Full\\" and working backwards.  And I am impressed.  \\"Flaming Pie\\" is a bit inconsistent, but the best songs are truly first rate, and the worst would be considered \\"good\\" by the standards of most other pop stars.  For our era, Paul stands alone as a songwriter.  He is our Schubert, our Gershwin.  I only wish that more people could appreciate the genius that we have in our midst.
B000002UAU|3.0|It's funny how history works. When it came out in 1967, Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was a seismic event. It was an instant cultural touchstone, a musical icon, a psychotropic chunk of pop art product that glistened with possibility and newness. It was, famously, the album that signaled the rise of rock `n' roll as an artform rather than a teenage flavor-of-the-decade. It was bold, energetic, and state-of-the-art. It was conceptual- even the packaging and cover art were part of the journey. It was innovative. In a visionary synthesis of Chuck Berry and Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson and Karlheinz Stockhausen, the Fab Four sought to combine experimentation and melody, innovation and whimsy, futurism and present...ism. It was the album that made it officially OK for popular artists to use tape loops and weird (read: non-European) instruments and genre hopping. Sure, other bands had been experimental before them, but the Beatles were the first megastars to do it over the length of a full album. Impressive.<br /><br />So, I'm not going to deny the historical significance of this album. I'm not quite insane enough to do that. I won't try to refute its influence, either. But what I am going to complain about is its listenability. Its raw musical value, if you will. Evaluating music on an intellectual level is interesting and useful, but it's all academic if the stuff doesn't make for a good listening experience. And by that measure, the Beatles have done much, much better than Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.<br /><br />It hasn't aged all that well, you see. I can do without a lot of this stuff: \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" is a cutesy music hall exercise that, all these years later, sounds cheeky and not all that entertaining. \\"Lovely Rita\\" and \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" sound absolutely generic, and \\"Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite!\\" is (how do I put this delicately?) annoying and stupid.<br /><br />Even some of the album's better songs aren't exactly top-drawer material: \\"She's Leaving Home\\" is sad and pretty, \\"Getting Better\\" is pleasantly bouncy (good lyrics, too), and \\"Within You Without You\\" shows off George's sitar fascination to trippy effect, but none of those three are particularly special. Same goes for the rocking title track.<br /><br />But having said all that, I still do think that this is a pretty good album. If the review so far has seemed harsh, it's because I've learned to hold the Beatles to a pretty high standard. A five-star Beatles album (Rubber Soul, Revolver, etc.) needs to be saturated with pure gold. On this disc, I only count a few true gems. \\"A Day In The Life\\" is the shiniest. It's an absolutely gorgeous song, a symphonic tale of quiet desolation and muted melancholia. I also like the quintessentially psychedelic \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,\\" and the inexplicably delightful \\"Fixing A Hole.\\"<br /><br />Rock historians, Beatle maniacs, and those who are trying to collect all of the obvious touchstones of musical history should certainly pick this up. Otherwise, think twice.eaving Home\\" is sad and pretty, \\"Getting Better\\" is pleasantly bouncy (good lyrics, too), and \\"Within You Without You\\" shows off George's sitar fascination to trippy effect, but none of those three are particularly special. Same goes for the rocking title track.    But having said all that, I still do think that this is a pretty good album. If the review so far has seemed harsh, it's because I've learned to hold the Beatles to a pretty high standard. A five-star Beatles album (Rubber Soul, Revolver, etc.) needs to be saturated with pure gold. On this disc, I only count a few true gems. \\"A Day In The Life\\" is the shiniest. It's an absolutely gorgeous song, a symphonic tale of quiet desolation and muted melancholia. I also like the quintessentially psychedelic \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,\\" and the inexplicably delightful \\"Fixing A Hole.\\"     Rock historians, Beatle maniacs, and those who are trying to collect all of the obvious touchstones of musical history should certainly pick this up. Otherwise, think twice.
0312945973|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite stories!  The characters are so well written & the story is outstanding.  The slave, Taita, who tells the story is an engaging character, and his devotion to Lostris, the daughter of his master, is heartwarming.  The adventures these two have over their lifetimes are so much fun to read.  There is also a lot of information about ancient Egyptian mythology, culture, etc. woven in so that you learn a lot while reading it.  This is one I re-read a couple times a year and I never get tired of it - what a great movie it would make!
B000002UAO|5.0|My favorite Beatles album, actually. Others were more experimental, influential, and innovative, but Rubber Soul is really the bee's knees, musically speaking. Chronologically speaking, it captures the Fab Four at a crossroads, bridging the gap between their tenure as the world's smartest teen pop band and rock `n' roll's preeminent celebrity mad scientists. As such, it captures the best of both worlds: The songs are smartly crafted pop classics with perfect melodies, but they're also bold and original. The lyrics are subtly poetic, the instrumentation is rich and complex, and even the most innocuous tracks burble with exciting new ideas.<br /><br />\\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\\" is a sepia-toned miracle, full of folk and mystery and parallel-universe pop melodies. It also has some of the best use of a sitar on a Beatles record.  \\"In My Life\\" is a tearjerker that can really jerk tears, a haunting work that's full of memory and melancholy. \\"Drive My Car\\" is really fun and really groovy, and the guitar solo is wonderfully, unbelievably, quintessentially 60s.<br /><br />But the real draw of this album is the underappreciated gems. Rubber Soul is full of `em. Take \\"You Won't See Me,\\" for example. It would have been the highlight of just about any other 60s group's career- it's an absolutely flawless pop song, from harmonies to lyrics to chord progressions. It's cool, it's wistful, it's catchy, it's dynamic, and it's fun. Perfect, I tell ya! \\"I'm Looking Through\\" is absolutely gorgeous, and \\"Wait\\" has one of the most bewitching choruses in history. I even like the much-maligned \\"Run For Your Life,\\" because it creates a genuine sense of menace and aggression. Marvelous!<br /><br />To top it off, the cover art is hipper than anything else in existence. Be hip and buy Rubber Soul. Bon App&eacute;tit.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I had heard a something about this show in some magazine (Wired?), and then I saw it at the store in a cool enlarged Zippo shaped case.  The only reason I purchased it though was because I recognized one of the actresses from Firefly.  Once I started watching I really enjoyed the 60's they created.  Not sterile but controlled, chauvinistic but poking fun... Lots of lovely ladies, drinking, smoking, and some clever writing.  Since it is only the first season, I suppose its only going to get better.  I've not listened to the commentaries or watched the special features yet but it's cool that they are there.  I will most likely purchase the next season.<br /><br />One note, as an Ad and Lucky Strike junky, I was very irritated from pilot where they tried to introduce the \\"It's Toasted\\" slogan by Don Draper in the 60's.  It actually came out in 1917, and was more than likely closely linked to the real granddaddy of advertising Edward Bernays.  They might have considered turning his life into a show, but once I started to watch the other episodes the minor deviations from facts for the sake of entertainment didn't seem so frustrating.
B00005JPNZ|5.0|For a man of his age, Harrison Ford seems to be in remarkable physical shape. I am much the same age, I attend a gym regularly, and I was pretty impressed I can tell you. Obviously the athletic feats will have been mainly faked, but they can't be faked entirely. Any Indiana Jones film is a feast of effects, and the director has not lost his touch, nor has the producer lost his imagination. A quarter of a century on, the familiar magic is still there.<br /><br />Aficionados of the earlier series will also welcome the return of Karen Allen as Marion, and she is in fine form too. There is also a spectacular new entrant from the new generation, no less than Cate Blanchett, unmistakable despite the hair-do, riveting and magnetic to watch as ever, and an ideal foil for Harrison Ford in an unfamiliar type of role. I don't really feel like offering a single criticism of any of the cast, because this is a film to be enjoyed for its panache, verve and originality, and if those components are there highbrow intellectual criticism should take a walk. The other rule for a reviewer ought to be `no spoilers', so I shall not try to describe the more spectacular incidents but say simply that on the one hand they are of the familiar kind, and on the other hand they are completely new and as original as ever. Perhaps I can risk just one reference and tip off anyone who has yet to see the film to look out in particular for the sword-fight on the speeding vehicles. As it happens, I saw the film in South America (English dialogue with Portuguese subtitles) and I had seen just enough of mountain roads in the area to relate my minor personal experience to the scene I was watching.<br /><br />How this new film on the block should be ranked in comparison with its predecessors I frankly don't know, and I don't really care either. I saw the others in the company of my own children all that time ago, and I think I reacted in much the same way this time as then. Anyone who enjoys the genre at all ought to enjoy this offering much as before. The dialogue, like the incidents, is still good, and there was even one line that I treasured particularly when my mind veered off at a tangent to discussions of certain current foreign policy initiatives, in which one sometimes encounters the sentiment `something had to be done.' From this movie I have taken away the excellent response `Anything else would have been good.'<br /><br />As one votary of the Indie series my simple message to any others, young or no longer young, is that this show ought to live up to your expectations. I can't imagine there will be any more now from the same stars.joy this offering much as before.

B0012QE4Q2|2.0|This movie was about what I expected of it - all hype and no substance.  It was okay that it strayed from the book's plot, and the costumes were very good, but the story line and acting left a lot to be desired.  It just doesn't show real passion in King Henry - for anything.  Little to nothing is presented about Wolsey and the church, which would have given strength to the premise that the King went to the extent he did for Anne Boleyn.  You just don't believe it.  Johansson is nice, but Portman's acting is as flat as it was in Star Wars.  I don't mind a different twist on a well known story, just make me believe it could happen!

B000N6TYLW|5.0|Got this for myself after getting cut off at the end of season six in reruns. Thoroughly enjoyed getting my GG fix in larger, commercial-free doses, as well as finding out how all the various story lines culminated. Some reviewers have complained that the writing in this last seventh season wasn't as good as previous years, after writer/creator/etc. Amy Sherman-Palladino left the show, but I have no real beef on that point. Great fun as always, & I've already watched the final two episodes several times--will enjoy revisiting all of these for years, I'm sure.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I loved this album from the very first play. I have been a fan since day one all those years ago and yes there were a album that I did not like but there are alot more that have given me years of enjoyment both as LPs and CDs.I never know what to excpect when I buy one of her albums and that is the magic of Madonna a artist that has reinvented her self over the years never afraid to put her self out there and going beyond what are the so called boundries of music. She really is the Queen and never afraid to tell it like it is

B0018AK9RA|5.0|It was obvious from the beginning that some people would love this CD and others would hate it. Hardcore fans who want little else than a regurgitation of Painkiller will be severely disappointed. Those who are able to open their minds and explore a new world of Priest will find this CD to be an absolutely amazing journey. This piece of work displays a depth that most bands never reach.     There is no one formula or sound that makes this album. It is a combination of musical styles that requires you to listen to this album multiple times to actually \\"get it.\\" This is precisely why some people will never \\"get it.\\" Sadly they are missing out on one of the most amazing concept albums ever written. There are no instant radio hits here.     When you do take the time to be absorbed into the world of Nostradamus, you find layers of music rather than just a catchy guitar riff. With Nostradamus, Priest are again pioneers, blending heavy metal with operatic verses and orchestral accompaniments. If for no other reason, this CD is worth purchasing just to hear Rob Halford sing in Italian on \\"Pestilence and Plague.\\" Halford shows that he is not just The Metal God, unleashing screams that will shatter glass and fragile ear drums, but that he is also a vocalist who SINGS with far more energy and talent than any pop tart that Fox Television tries to make into an \\"idol.\\" This is not bubble-gum rock boys and girls. This is not pretty. This is not the 4 minute hit single they play on MTV with a bunch of screaming kids who don't even know what they are screaming at. This is Judas Priest. This is Rock & Roll. This is Heavy Metal. But this time, it's done with finesse that's usually reserved for much different musical genres. Congratulations to Judas Priest for taking the chance, and for doing it exceptionally well. There's a reason why this band is selling out arenas almost 35 years after their inception.     My final advice to anyone looking to purchase this CD. Do it! But you need toput in the time with this album to appreciate it. Priest took over two years to write and record this album. Listen to it in full- from beginning to end. Then do it again. And again. You need to immerse yourself into the world they created to truly appreciate it. If you put in the time, you will reap the rewards that this masterpiece has to offer.     All hail to the Call of The Priest and bow before The Metal Gods!
B00028HBKM|1.0|I fell for the hype at first and put my family thru the gore fest of Gibsons imagination. I had trouble enjoying the film because of all the extra material that is not in scriptures.    Then I found the source of all the non-biblical content of this film.    ==\\"Director Gibson intended fidelity to the New Testament, yet expanded the screenplay by making use of additional sources. The principal, most controversial source is The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ the meditations of the stigmatic, German nun Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich (1774-1824), as told to the poet Clemens Brentano. Her vision of Christ's Passion depicts certain Jews as more vicious and bloodthirsty than the Romans ruling Judaea. A secondary, extra-biblical source is The Mystical City of God by Maria de Agreda (1602-1665), a 17th century Spanish nun, and some imagined sequences.\\" -- source- [...]    There are plenty of other sources out there telling the same story about this. The Roman Catolics are eager to give credit to Emmerich for her contribution to this film.    So for all of us Sola Scriptura folk this show is an abomination that has no place in our video collection and especially in our churches!    Everyone is responsible for themselves so stop sheepishly following everything suggested to us and hold EVERYTHING to scripture.    thank you,  Don
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I started sixth grade when Beverly Hills 90210 aired in October 1990. I remember girls talking about how cute Dylan McKay was. The first episode I watched was Perfect Mom, where Brenda presumes Kelly and her mother have a picture perfect relationship. I never really \\"got into\\" 90210 until CBS made them available online. I watched the pilot and got hooked! The show has its lame moments, it is dated, but it is still fun to watch!!! My favorite characters are Brenda and Brandon Walsh. The Walsh family is likeable and realistic. The show isn't as dramatic as it became. Rather, each episode presents a different situation a teen might be dealing with. From addict parents to alcohol, shoplifting to abuse, as well as some more lighthearted moments, like the episode where Brenda cares for a stray dog and Brandon coaches a snotty little league team. Some younger viewers might find the show dated and irrelevant, but for the last of the \\"Gen Xers\\", this show is perfect.<br /><br />The music, fashions, and lingo will take you back to your 1990-1991 schoolyear. I remember the high-waisted jeans, scrunchies, belts, etc. Not to mention the music- Concrete Blonde's Joey makes an appearance in One Man and His Baby. The lingo \\"bro\\", \\"Hey B!\\", and Hey D!\\"<br /><br />All in all, check out season one. If you don't like it, at least you'll get a feel for early 90s America.

B0017MO10U|5.0|After 10 seasons stargate was still going strong.  The Arc of Truth which finnished up the Ori story line was just ok in my opinion but this one was amazing... The effects, story and acting was perfect.  It was exciting to see my favorite team back in action allong with Baal the last of the system lords.  If you ever liked the original feel to stargate you will love this.  I am amazed at how well they did and it even had Jack back too.  Two words... \\"Buy This!\\"  Bluray is even better!  I only wish this came to theaters........
B000XGDO04|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  I do not often listen to the mainstream radio stations or music television, but I happened to catch a clip of \\"Hometown Glory\\" and it was beautiful so I did some searching and found this album. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I do not understand why everyone has to compare her to other people. I think she creates amazing music in her own right.  Yes, she has a bit of the raspy retro sound as a few others who have recently hit the charts, but is that really a bad thing?  How many rock bands have similarities?  Country? Rap?  I think it's great to have a broad variety of music that is actually worth listening to.<br /><br />Let Adele be Adele.
B000RPTQ1C|3.0|I have to say that I've been a huge fan of Coldplay's since I first heard Yellow almost a decade ago. So I always anxiously await a new Colplay album. And I always have super-high expectations (probably too high).    So upon first listen to Viva La Vida, I was immediately disappointed. It seemed way too short, which lead me to think that they just mailed this one in. My friend said he liked it though, and that it reminded him of the Beatles, which I thought a bit odd.    So upon a 2nd and 3rd listen, I grew to like it a little more with each listening. However, I don't think it's ever going to be as good as their other albums, no matter how many times I listen to it. There is some good stuff on here, but just not epic-good-stuff.    Am I going to be listening to Viva La Vida five years from now like X&Y or A Rush of Blood? It's tough to say... and I think that's the real measure of an album for a band like Coldplay.
B000OVLBEY|1.0|Ghost Rider  Ghost Rider is probably one of the most horrible films that my eyes have ever had the dissatisfaction of viewing. Literally every thing went wrong in this movie. The CG is horrible. The writing is horrible. The action is nonexistent. The fact that you are even looking up this DVD is shameful.    The story...I don't even want to have to explain this crap because it was so bad. Johnny Blaze and his father Barton Blaze are carnival workers who amaze audiences with their motorcycles stunts. Johnny is in love with a woman named Roxanne and they want to run away together. Johnny soon realizes his father has Cancer and is very upset by it. So he goes to the carnival to play with his bikes. Suddenly the Devil shows up and says that he'll cure Barton's Cancer if Johnny will sign his soul over. Johnny accepts and Barton's cancer goes away. Then, the Devil turns out to be a complete a-hole and kills his father anyway. The Devil tells him to forget about his friends, family, and loved ones. So he does and rides off.    Johnny, played by Nicolas Cage, goes on to live a fairly normal life. Oddly enough he has friends and still remembers everything about the girl he once loved. Obviously the Devil had no idea what he was doing. The Devil then tells Johnny that he's going to have to kill Blackheart and The Hidden Ones. Yes, that is what they are called.    The beginning segment that shows his carnival days with his dad is horrible. The entire part is full of bad acting, bad CG, and bad everything. His later years are basically the same thing. The Hidden Ones are elemental demons that Johnny seems to be fighting for no reason, but lack anything really cool about them. Nicolas Cage literally kills all of them in one swift move. If all else fails, he uses his stare of death. Yes...he stares at them...to death. He was wasting his time; he could've just made them watch this movie and they would've died. After he completely dominants these villains you will hear great lineslike \\"It's time to clear the air\\" or some random laugh. This is all added in with the fact that he has this evil demon voice and sounds like a 12-year-old girl when he acts that way. It eliminates any possibility of Ghost Rider having anything cool about him at all. The entire thing is so cheesy you'll think you've become a cheese nip.    At least you get some cool fight scenes right? The movie Bambi had more action in it. Nicolas Cage just waves his badly computer generated chain around and the bad guys just vanish...or he stares at them and they die. I mean...this is pathetic.    Overall this movie has no redeeming qualities to it at all. If you loved the comic book, don't watch this movie. If you love movies, don't watch it. If you love your kids, don't watch this because I am afraid of what might happen to them in your rage over this movie. Don't give them the stare of death!
B000IFQLSW|5.0|I initially wasn't going to add anything to this heavily reviewed item except to note that there is a reason this project generated so much buzz. Now that many of the artists featured are deceased, it reinforces how valuable the effort was and how noble the intent. I bought this package along with \\"Live On\\", and listened to that one first. Wasn't really enthused about it, decided to not review it. Then I watched \\"10 Days Out\\" and have had the CD in my truck ever since. Make sure to watch the Extras on the DVD as well, to catch Kenny and Buddy Flett light off a smokin' version of Flett's \\"Dance For Me Girl\\". Also - as an aside, I am getting to see BB later this month at age 82. If it wasn't for this DVD, I really wouldn't have appreciated how much this is an opportunity that must not be missed. It isn't very often that an artist puts something out that leaves you feeling grateful. Thanks to all involved.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I was very pleased with how the Ori saga ended, it was as great as the show, and even more so as a movie, everything I expected and more, and I can't wait for the next movie. I'm a big Stargate fan, have been for years, and this movie just proves how great of a show it was.
B00132D808|5.0|An amazing cd. They have grown more musicaly as a band. To me at times they sounded similar to the beatles, with their song \\"behind the sea\\" sounding reminscent to \\"octopus garden\\" by the beatles. Relaxing, fun, and great for the whole family. One of my favorite cd's of this year. You can tell in this cd that they were truelly trying to prove themselves as a band and not a loud symphony with a orchestra, and they sure did prove themselves. (they took out the panic! for just panic. They did a great job in this cd, it was very diverse which i loved. From folkin around to the piano knows something i don't, how can you not appreciate that talent. If you are only into panic because they were loud and crazy in the first one then maybe you wouldnt like the new one, for me its all about talent and these guys defantely have amazing talent.
B0000028VT|4.0|With each new Mariah release, I tend to go back to her earlier albums and listen to them again and this time I selected MUSIC BOX.  Honestly this was never one of my favorite albums and I didn't actually purchase it until about a year or two AFTER I'd purchased BUTTERFLY.<br /><br />It is a good, well constructed album that perfectly symbolizes where Mariah stood career-wise at that time.  According to her accounts today, she was micro-managed and only allowed to produce songs that appealed more to the adult contemporary market yet I believe this album remains her biggest seller to date primarily due to the touching ballads and her heartfelt delivery of the songs.<br /><br />Listening to it today, I still love the songs that I loved \\"back in the day\\": ANYTIME YOU NEED A FRIEND, HERO, DREAMLOVER, WITHOUT YOU & MUSIC BOX.  I also gained a new appreciation for: NOW THAT I KNOW - a fun uptempo track; ALL I'VE EVER WANTED & NEVER FORGET YOU - two beautiful ballads.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|This turntable is very inexpensive, but it works very good. The duel hookup (L/R RCA jacks + USB)is nice and the included software is top-shelf. This is a great way to add vinyl music to your mp3 collection.
B000NIVJGI|4.0|I love this film and this disc, which looks great on my very good HD projector.  I don't get why the stars are not listed in the Amazon info, though, and why the older, 2000 dvd is labeled blu-ray.<br />I was right outa college in 1963, and summered in a similar place. The spirit and sound of the film are period perfect.  Swayze and Grey are a perfect film couple; they are sympathetic characters with great chemistry.  The standard Hollywood conventions and devices mount up by the end, spoiling the \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\".  For a while, though, you can forget this is a Hollywood movie.  Regardless of its increasing implausibility as the film barrels along, I still felt tears well up at the finale.
B000AYEL6U|3.0|This movie had rave reviews so I decided to get it. The leading man spent waaaay too much time frowing. I wonder if when they went to cast the part they asked a bunch of guys to line up, and whoever could glare for the longest amount of time they hired. I think that the fellow only smiled in the last 30 seconds of the movie.<br />I would say that the film it self was far too dramatic and that the drama was caused by people not being honest. Those people then spent the rest of the movie avoiding each other only resolving spontaneously in the last 2 minutes.

B000GGSMF8|5.0|OK, I'll admit right away that i don't get the criticisms below. i am one of those people who shudder at the adaptations of the Beatles, Stones, the Led, Dead Kennedys or Bobby Zimmerman. Yet i  love this album. Some pieces (like Dancing with Myself or The Killing Moon) are better than the originals and others (like the Human Fly) or Bela Lugosi's Dead - the adaptation of the famous Bauhaus song - are almost like new songs, originals themselves.  The singing is subtle and intense at the same time - this is no lounge music. Remind me of Pink Martini, only better.
B0015519VS|4.0|If you want some good soul/R&B music, then I DEFINITELY recommend this album. Usher has really matured into a man on this album, and his music is only getting better as he's growing. His ballads are beautiful and everyone can relate to them in one way or another. My two favorite songs on this album are moving mountains and what's a man to do. This is an album everyone should have in their collection.
140120306X|5.0|Even if you haven't read the 101 novels, plays and pulp magazines referenced in this thrilling roller coaster action adventure, you'll still love it. It's high speed chase through 1950's England climaxing at the 3D top of the world, punctuated by extracts from the fabled Black Dossier - The book about all the previous Leagues of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Is that James Bond? Is that Emma Peel? Has Billy Bunter grown up and become George Orwells Big Brother? You Decide.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of the best shows ever.  Unfortunatly, it is the complete series, indicating that there will never be any more of them.  On the up side though, it comes in slim cases with extra commentaries and deleted scenes!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I find this workout to be exactly as J. Michaels describes it:  a great workout in a short period of time.  Definitely a whole body (to include cardio) event that I think will produce the results I was aiming for when I purchased it.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|I purchased this cd when I visited Singapore a few years ago and I am happy that I bought this cd.  This was the first of the cds that I had owned by Phil Collins and I believe that it was worh the money I spent.  Why the 4 stars instead of the five?  Currently I am 27 years old and I am happy to know that there are songs on this cd that I remember hearing on the radio and had first heard when I was growing up.  I was delighted to hear \\"two hearts\\" a beautiful and upbeat song that I first heard when I was around 8 years old and \\"you can't hurry love\\".  I also love \\"groovy kind of love\\", \\"one more night\\", \\"dance into the light\\" and \\"against all odds\\".  There are other good songs on this cd but the ones I just mentioned happen to be some of my favorites.  The only con was that I eventually had to buy a genesis greatest hits compilation to get some of the other great phil collin's songs(which I finally did last year and will review later).  However if you are willing to look past this collection missing some of his other great songs you will honestly enjoy this cd.  I know that I said it before but this cd is so good that I still play it even though its been a few years since I first bought it (I am 27 now and I remember first buying the cd when I was around 21-22 years of age).  I also  agree with the one reviewer that had stated that this cd is a good first place to start if  this would be your first time owning a Phil Collins greatest hits collection.

B0002XNRG4|5.0|Wanting to have a light kit for four months on the (rail)roads in Europe, I acquired a Canon XTi, 10-22mm zoom, the 17-85 IS zoom and 70-300 USM III IS zoom. I got them all in the six months before going and tested them thoroughly in my typical shooting of flowers, scenery, animals and grandkids.    On the trip I was surprised at how tough the little XTi was--and how good the sensor. Another surprise was the fact that the 17-85mm was used virtually all the time. The wide zoom was used for about ten percent of the 8600 images I shot and the 70-300 very rarely. If I were to go on another such journey, I would not hesitate to use the 17-85mm IS lens on an APS-sensor Canon as my only lens--it proved to be that good. I might add a polarising filter for reducing reflections and a walking stick and small beanbag for those places where monopods are not welcomed.    The photos have proved stunning, whether macro, panoramic scenes or street scenes. The European Union has passed some rather stringent rules protecting a person's rights to their own image, so you have to be careful not to do closeups of individuals without permission or you will be explaining very quickly that you are not shooting for commercial purposes.    I've seen many comparisons where this lens is not rated as highly as the L glass, but even in this computer-crafted technology, there are individual lenses that rise above the standard or sink below it. Perhaps I've always been lucky, because I've never been disappointed by Canon.
B0014KD46W|4.0|The more I listen to this the more I like it. Strictly from a fan's point of view, I refuse to be hypercritical. This CD runs the gamut in styles ranging from his Low Spark days to Back In The High Life. Dirty City, predictably, is a great cut with Clapton, but give the rest of it a chance to grow on you. Winwood's genius is still much more than just a flicker.
B000002LIX|5.0|Amazon's reviewer Genevieve Williams sets out writing something about the \\"by far best\\" of Jane's Addiction, an album that centers around the artistic achievements of the band's masterpiece \\"Three Days\\", and the very wonderful \\"Then She Did\\", and misses the point entirely. This review generated a really strong reaction in me because it is featured on here and is so off base it is negligent. She writes,\\"Unfortunately, \\"Three Days\\" and \\"Then She Did . . .\\" are overlong and get bogged down well short of halfway through\\". I think any fan would say that both songs are exactly as long as they need to be.    To say that \\"Three Days\\" gets bogged down well short of halfway through seems to suggest that she didn't really listen to the song because for one thing, the song doesn't even really get started until halfway through. More than that, it's a dynamic song with multiple parts that builds to a heavy emotional crescendo and has purpose and meaning for each fantastic experience that each minute brings. The song only gets better as it progresses, particularly in the middle section, which features some of Navaro's best guitar work. Every art rock band needs their epic, and \\"Three Days\\" is theirs. \\"Three Days\\" is in fact the corner stone of the artistic ability of Jane's Addiction and to me their definitive statement. To undermine it's quality based on it's length shows a real lack of understanding of the song and therefore of the \\"by far best\\" album and therefore of the band.    Not to mention that \\"Then She Did\\" is a song that exemplifies Jane's Addictions other side, a compliment to their fast and blazing hard funk rock, a side that was also flawlessly executed with \\"Summertime Rolls\\". It is a slower, more meditative and sometimes experimental side. To lose the middle solo section would take away so much from the nature of the song. It's also a nice bring-down song from the epic experience of \\"Three Days\\".     This album is nearly 100% amazing from start to finish. It has agreat blend of hits, innovative funky alternative hard rock, and experimentation. It's the kind of album I'd bring with me on a desert island. When bands with the kind of talent of Jane's Addiction put their power into lengthy pieces like those mentioned above, they deserved to be given more justifiable criticism than lazy words like \\"overlong\\". You can't expect a band that reintroduced art rock to popular music to stick to their 4 minute funky rock formula all the time. Personally, I don't believe calling the heart of an album \\"unfortunate\\" for any reason is really understanding what the album is going for. Jane's Addiction will take you on a trip, you just have to let them take you there. [[ASIN:B000002LIX Ritual de lo Habitual]]

B00003CXHJ|4.0|Captain Dahlgreen (Bill Paxton), Mr. Tyler (Matthew McCougnehey), and a hard-nosed Master Chief (Harvey Keitel) lead a group of sailors aboard an American submarine during WWII.  Prior to disembarkment, they are boarded by two military intelligence officers with knowledge of a German submarine, a U-Boat, that possibly has the Enigma onboard, a powerful encryption/decryption device through which secret German messages can be intercepted and used against the enemy.<br /><br />Upon locating the enemies, the plan is to forcibly board the U-Boat, grab the Enigma, and sink the enemy ship.  With any luck, the Germans will not know their device has been stolen, and the allies can take advantage of the communication breach to turn the tide in the war.<br /><br />The plan is going perfectly and all German prisoners have been transferred to the U.S. vessel.  The last remaining people are making the transition from enemy ship to ally ship when an unidentified German U-Boat sneaks up on the action and fires a torpedo into the broad-side of the U.S. ship, destroying it on impact.  From there it's a cat and mouse game between the subs, as the Germans try to sink their own ship in order to save their secret.  Meanwhile, the Americans have to contend with not only the German line of ships - inconveniently between the Americans and the nearest safe-haven, England; but they're also battling a wounded, sitting-duck of a sub, and possible saboteurs in their midst.<br /><br />The tense action is palpable, and there is a definite feeling of claustrophobic fear as the sailors attempt to descend before the enemies can sink them.  The dark, cold water can suck the air and life out of a person, and the men reflect that realism with every bead of sweat, every hushed voice, and every furrowed brow that acknowledges the deep, surrounding oceans.<br /><br />Great sub movie with tons of action.  It's a must have for any military-movie collection.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I'm definitely in agreement with most of the previous reviewers. You will either love or hate this movie. There won't be much middle ground. (ex. I loved it, and my wife hated it) Something you SHOULD know before watching this movie, is that it is shot entirely from a handheld video camera. Entirely. That means there is alot of moving and shaking and bouncing all around. (think Blair Witch Project, but in NYC) I personally liked the personal frame of reference. I guess it just made it feel more real, and me feel less detached from it. The dialogue in some of the scenes didn't quite fit. Characters cracking jokes at times, and in situations, where they obviously wouldn't. There is no bow on this one tying everything together folks. The end is just the end. There's no twist, and there are no explanations. It's pretty simply. Monster attacks New York, and people run for their lives.
B000KJU1MS|4.0|10 DVD discs and not a single version of 'Rocket Ride\\" - This is why I only gave it 4 stars:<br /><br />And I now own all of the box sets I cannot believe that 'Rocket Ride' is not included on any of them especially after Ace Frehley was such an influence on them and that they decided to honor him and Peter Criss in such ways but I noticed in the liner notes by Paul Stanley said that Criss basically tried his darndest to make everyone feel miserable during the final tour. I don't really know if that is true or not but Simmons and Stanley are after all 'marketing geniuses' and could have just said this in order to sell more copies.<br /><br />\\"Rocket Ride\\" is a song by the American hard rock band Kiss originally featured on their 1977 album Alive II. A studio recording written by Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley and Sean Delaney, it was the first Kiss single to feature Frehley on lead vocals, and peaked at #39 on the American Billboard Hot 100 [1], making it the band's seventh US Top 40 hit.<br /><br />\\"Rocket Ride\\" proved to be the only studio track of the five recorded for Alive II that Frehley would perform on, as Bob Kulick was brought into perform on some of the other tracks. Ace noted in the booklet for the Kiss Box Set, released in 2001, that this was the first vocal performance that he was satisfied with.<br /><br />Ace Frehley's 2008 tour in support of his unnamed unreleased album is named after this song, The Rocket Ride Tour<br /><br />  laughingpig1@yahoo.com
B0010ZR160|4.0|This is a pretty good movie based on a really good book. Definitely not necessary to read the book first. A little girl goes missing from her bedroom in the middle of the night while her good for nothing Mother was having a good time. The two main characters are private detectives hired by the aunt of the missing girl to supplement the massive police investigation. This film shows how awful some places in this world really are, and it reminds you that children are born into it every day. Casey Affleck did a good job as Patrick Kenzie. He basically carries the whole movie. There is a great twist of an ending that will really leave you with something to discuss after the movie is over. Definitely recommended.
6305910340|5.0|I bought this film for a friend whom I played over 50 chess games with (2 of which I one and he tutored me on chess theory throughout) as a graduation gift.  I hadn't even heard of kinsley and didn't even recognize fishburne when I first saw this, nowadays I'd recommend the movie just for those actors alone, but even without the \\"good acting\\" the movie pace and plot has a mesmerizing feel.  This -- along with a lot of kingsley's acting -- just has an incredible flow to it.  Excellent film.
B0011NVC9I|2.0|I guess I never really understood what they were trying to do with this movie. It was like watching \\"Shrek\\" with alot of violence and nudity. (blood and butts, if you will) By the time I got over the visuals of the movie (the \\"real\\" animation was pretty disconcerting at first), I was stuck in the middle of a very boring plot. I'm not sure, but I don't think it followed the real storyline of Beowulf. I was very disappointed in this movie.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Starwars on Blu-ray i am looking forward to it i would have been looking forward to it on HDDVD but thanks to Blu-ray winning the battle its a oneway option which blows like how Madden for EA Sports just brought out the whole NFL gaming licence so no other company can make another footgame for Playstation or XBOX but back to starwars which i would had brought on HDDVD because like most gamers out here they are biais and wanna either be sony fan boys or girls yes i know females gamers we need more of them xboxers or nes followers in which me i accept and own all 3 systems so i dont pick sides but blu-ray ok awesome my gripe with the regular dvd versions of Starwars was that with the commentary it had not only Lucas but his sound people and rick one of his producers if i am right i mean hearing from these guys are cool but i wanted to hear Geogre Lucas talk and only him so if the blu-ray comes out still have those guys with you but also have a only Geogre Lucas commentary because i really wanted hear what he had to say.   Example Episode 3 Mace Windu/Sidous fight ok they fight u hear Geogre talk only a little bit but then it goes to Rick and then his sound designer Bert and honestly i really wanted to hear Geogre Lucas explain everything like i said nothing against these guys but i just really wanna hear Geogre Lucas yack about his creation so yes bring these movies to Blu-ray but please have a Geogre Lucas only commentary have every other commentary like the DVD but make the Lucas only one. thanks all.
B00177Y9ZC|4.0|My feeling about this movie is just like what Christensen says about Rome in the movie, \\"if you want to see it without all the boring parts.\\" They definitely cut all the fluff here. Some could argue that portions of the plot suffer b/c of this but it's definitely for the greater good of the film. The main character realizes that \\"jump\\" during a dire situation. Realizing that he has a great power he uses it to his advantage and illegally accumulates wealth, woman, and toys. He's drawn into a controversy that he was unware existed when he finds out that he is not alone, and that all \\"Jumpers\\" are hunted by the \\"Paladins\\" (lead by Samuel L. Jackson) The conflict between these two is the entire second half of the film. There is alot of shaky camera work during most of the action scenes, probably to facilitate the special effects. It can be a little disconcerting at times. Short and sweet. It's one wild ride that you don't want to miss.
B0010ZR160|5.0|Upon hearing of this movie I was slightly intrigued, mostly because of the Oscar nomination attached to Amy Ryan who I had never heard of. After watching it though, I was very pleasantly surprised. The movie was considerably well made, a great start for Ben Affleck's directorial career. Based on a novel by Dennis Lehan and adapted by Ben Affleck, Gone Baby Gone starts out with a deceivingly simple plot and expands and grows with great intensity. Simply put, the story is wonderfully written.<br />There is an impressive mix of character dynamics in the movie. In other words, certain characters relations to each other greatly facilitate a complex and interesting story. Along with its fine plot, Gone Baby Gone has a phenomenal cast and they help to display these dynamics excellently. On top of Amy Ryan's Oscar nominated role (which is quite deserved I think), Casey Affleck, Ed Harris, and Morgan freeman deliver splendid performances as well. While the performances are what we should expect of actors with the experience of the latter two, Casey Affleck is deservedly building an impressive resume too.<br />In keeping with a good plot, deeper messages in the story very thought provoking. In some senses, it displays the traditional dilemma of \\"do the ends justify the means\\" but does so in a way that makes it too hard to simply take one side or the other.<br /><br />An outstanding debut for Ben Affleck: the director. Thanks to an extremely well written book and Ben Affleck's directorial talent Gone Baby Gone is a great movie and I definitely recommend it to those looking for a deep, edgy drama.

B0013D8LOU|5.0|Sweeny Todd is one of my favorite movies of the year. The movie is the combined effort of regular collaborators Tim Burton, Jonny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter. The film has Tim Burton's signature style all over it with its dark macabre look, its dark macabre romance, and its dark macabre everything else. But that's okay because it works.<br />Probably the first thing people will notice about the movie is that it's a musical. Though you don't usually think of serial killers and musicals at the same time, Sweeny Todd really makes it work and the music, credited to Stephen Sondheim, is excellently written. The performances in Sweeny Todd are very good as well. Jonny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter work wonderfully together while Alan Rickman and young newcomer Ed Sanders do extremely well also.<br /><br />This is a great movie and I highly recommend it. The level of violence may get to some people (not many these days) but if that doesn't bother you then by all means, see it. I didn't really like musicals as a kid so if I can enjoy this as much as I did than I'm sure you can too.

B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno is a very good, unique story and one of my favorite movies of the year. If you ask me (and in a sense you are.) the real star of this film is the script. Written by first time screenwriter Diablo Cody, Juno really is as they say \\"this year's little miss sunshine\\" It's refreshingly original, quirky and funny. It is also very heartwarming...but only towards the end. Through the majority of the film, like little miss sunshine, things pretty much get worse for the protagonists as time goes on but it is certainly not without laughs throughout. Besides, that is what makes the ending all the more powerful.<br />The thing that struck me the most was the honesty in the dialogue. It certainly isn't completely realistic and Juno and her friend have more witty things to say then is probably natural but nonetheless, the dialogue in the film is probably more realistic than most. The film's acting is also something of note. Ellen Page, who was nominated for an Oscar for her role, delivers a great performance. In addition, the other actors in the film, such as Michael Cera and Jason Bateman also give good performances. Like his other roles, Michael Cera who plays Juno's love interest (more or less), plays awkward better than any actor I have seen. If you've seen Superbad or any episode of Arrested Development than you know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Juno is defiantly a movie worth seeing. Juno defiantly isn't a laugh-out-loud kind of comedy but I don't think that's what they're going for. With a good cast, simple humor, and a believable script, you can't really go wrong and I don't think they did.
0307386864|5.0|No need for lots of words here: this is one the best books ever written.  Each re-reading highlights Austen's genius, as new gems are discovered throughout in various forms.  'nuff said.
B000OHZJKK|5.0|The album is flawless. The musicianship is so tight and economical that not a single note or beat seems out of place (every person I've ever known is thrilled to hear 'Pump it Up'). While obviously one would not cast EC in \\"I Pagliacci\\" his vocal tones and inflections are perfect for his material, perhaps never more so than on this record.    But what makes listening to this so breathtaking is the songwriting. This, along with 'Armed Forces' form the most brilliant collection of compositions in the history of popular music. The genre that once relied on \\"one-two-three'o'clock, four'o'clock rock\\" and \\"tutti-fruitti aw rooty\\" now had Declan the Great to provide \\"you want to throw me away, but I'm not broken\\" and \\"I want to bite the hand that feeds me\\".    Forget trying to pigeonhole this by saying it was part of this new wave trend or that punk scene - this is one of the greatest of all rock and roll records PERIOD and should be owned by everyone.
B0015UKX7Y|5.0|Being an Arctic Monkey's fan I was curious about this release. I checked out a vid on youtube and was blown away. Tony Hatch meets Ennio Morricone with a venomous wit in the voice. Way more \\"over the top\\" then any of the \\"Lounge/Soul/Retro\\" acts today it succeeds in it's bombast and satisfies with each listen. It may borrow from the past but this is NEW music that is as exciting as it's predecessors, if not more. Owen Pallet (arranger) and James Ford (producer) are unsung heros that need to be watched. This thing is massive, I hope they take it on the road.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|There's already been a lot of reviews of this latest release by Coldplay. I know I probably don't have much to say about the album that hasn't already been mentioned by other reviewers, but I still feel like putting my two cents in, I guess.<br /><br />First off, I would like to say that I've been a Coldplay fan from day one. Even before they became really popular. Their first album, Parachutes, to me, has always been the bands best work so far, and their third album, X & Y, was somewhat of a disappointment for me. After hearing about this newest effort and how the band was planning to expand their musical boundaries a bit, I was very hopeful that Viva La Vida would be an improvement from X & Y. After hearing the first single \\"Violet Hill\\", I knew that the band had definitely taken a step forward in their songwriting.<br /><br />Upon purchasing this album, I would have to say that Vida La Vida is, in my opinion, the band's best effort since Parachutes. To say that this record is a huge departure from Coldplay's other work may be stretching it a bit. Its not like Radiohead's Kid A compared to OK Computer or anything like that, but the band has definitely brought in other elements to their work with this release, and it works very well. This album isn't one of those records that feels like the band tried too hard to be different. There's the right amount of balance to it. Make no mistake about it, this is still very much a Coldplay album, but there's just enough change in it, but make you raise up and pay attention, and realize that this isn't the \\"same old stuff\\" from Chris Martin and Co. First of all, the subject material of some songs have changed. There's not as many of the patented Chris Martin sad love songs on Vida La Vida that many people have grown accustomed to. Here, lyrical content also focuses on war, politics, and religion. As far as the musical changes, there are definitely recognizable. There are more strings than in any other Coldplay album, along with unique instruments such as the Persian santur. But again, the signature Coldplay sound is still very much present with plenty of melodies and sing-a-long choruses.<br /><br />When trying to single out the best tracks here, its a bit difficult, all the tracks here are really good, its just a matter of opinion of the best songs I suppose. My personal favorites are \\"Lost\\", \\"Violet Hill\\", and \\"Yes\\", with the latter of these quite possibly being the most experimental song the band has ever written.<br /><br />In closing, if you're a Coldplay fan, there absolutely no reason not to like Viva La Vida, in fact, you might become like me, and decide that this may be their best record yet. And if you're not a Coldplay fan, this may be the album that wins you over. In either case, the record is a definite buy. And when all is said and done, I feel that this will end up being one of Coldplay's finest records.uments such as the Persian santur.

B000929AJQ|1.0|That's the best way to describe this album.  I am not a die-hard Nine Inch Nails fan, but I was utterly captivated by The Downward Spiral and The Fragile.  The Fragile also includes some of my favorite songs of all time, number one being \\"The Great Below\\"<br /><br />So it seems Reznor's abandoned the innovative, haunting style of The Fragile for something more upbeat, down to earth, and average.<br /><br />There's very little in the album beyond typical guitar, bass, drums, which is the standard for rock, but after the sort of things Trent Reznor has done before, comes as a disappointment---with greater style and innovation comes greater expectations.<br /><br />And the album is about as MTV-friendly as a NIN album could possibly be, with very little substance to any of the songs to make them in any way remarkable from one another.  \\"The Hand that Feeds\\" has a very catchy beat, but when you break it down, it amounts to little more than the exact same 5 note guitar riff repeated throughout the entire song paired with some mostly unintelligible and droning lyrics.<br /><br />In my previous experience, NIN seemed to be a fusing of art, music, and innovation.  This album seems to pull back on all three of them, perhaps for the money.

B0014XCMVM|5.0|I've always liked Alanis, and her rocking, rigid edge, but when I heard she would be working with Guy for this record, I got really excited. Not only does this album produce lyrics that actually make you think about life, love, and death, it has the super-synthetic pulsating vibes that interconnect and intertwine into layers and layers as they collide and compound blissfully. But it does this ever so lightly, and of course with a rock edge. Pure Genius. This album has really helped me cope with the ever changing world outside my walls. So much as happend to all of us, as humans, and Alanis shows she's just like us.<br /><br />Incredible standouts would have to be the lead single, \\"Underneath,\\" the eternally dark \\"Versions Of Violence,\\" the beautifully blooming effort of \\"Not As We,\\" the power of \\"Tapes\\" and \\"Torch\\" show another side of Alanis lingering around the thoguhts of seperation and death ... whether of life or relationship. And we can't forget how every Alanis Album starts with a BANG! \\"Citizen Of The Planet\\" does indeed deliver. But the Highlight of the album has to be \\"Giggling Again For No Reason.\\" Even though we all may go through some pretty terrible times in our lives, this song is like the sunlight as it fills in every crack of the Earth. It's the light we reach at the end of the tunnel, knowing that we will be okay. (I just have a personal connection with the whole album, especially that song, and I'm sure many others do as well.) And to that, the final song, \\"Incomplete\\" leaves us with a pleasing outlook on what we all really want from this life.<br /><br />This album is a Gem; it as dark and as deep as the ocean at times and other times it shines brightly into the horizon. I've never been happier with another album in my life. And for that reason, Alanis' lastest effort one of the greatest albums I've ever heard, and is the one to bet in 2008 ... if not the decade. It's so different than everything that is being played nowadays. It's worth giving it a try. I did. And I couldn't be more contented.<br /><br />Thank you Alanis. For Saving My Life.And I couldn't be more contented.    Thank you Alanis. For Saving My Life.

0440419514|5.0|I've read a number of one-star reviews that compel me to write a review myself. What I think is disturbing is the lack of recognition of the spirituality in Phillip Pullman's writing that reviewers seem to have. This book is not a testament of atheism. On the contrary. There is a VAST difference between spirituality and religiosity. I think Pullman attempts to make these differences more stark in his story-telling.<br /><br />That does not make one an atheist.<br /><br />Like the characters in the book we are invited to look beyond our own limited vision of our world and our concepts of what we believe God to embody. Pullman is not out to destroy God, rather he is out to destroy the reification of spirituality. Those that criticize this series on this basis are missing the point entirely. I suggest you go back and re-read with an OPEN mind.<br /><br />For those who have not read it, it's an enjoyable series that at times can drag a little bit in plot and have seemingly point-less diversions. The arc of the story is not limited to one book but rather all three. See it through and you will understand. Read with an open-mind...because when it comes down to it there is no other way to be.

This is no where near \\"American Life\\" although people tend to think it is. We all know she has once again re-invented herself, working with new people, such as Timberland. It seems everyone he works with will have commerical success. \\"4 Minutes\\" is a great first single and the follow up \\"Give It 2 Me\\" the album highlight. Other \\"Incredible\\" songs (including the above quoted) are \\"Devil,\\" \\"Miles Away,\\" and \\"Heartbeat.\\" Whether you like to see her booty get down, express her love 6,000 miles apart, or save the world in four minutes, it's important to see that Madonna hasn't, and will never, let us down. \\"Hard Candy\\" is sticky and sweet and even if it isn't as great as her previous effort it's important to know that she's still here. She don't need to catch her breath. She can go on and on and on. No one's going to stop her now!<br /><br />HARD CANDY 4/5 (I gave it this to balance out all the pathetic 1-star reveiws ... Hard Candy is anything but!)
B0012Q732O|3.0|When I saw the previews, I thought this was going to be full of animals and action. They show the Saber tooth twice, terror birds once and the mammoths a few times. The rest of the movie is a mix of Pathfinder and Apocalypto. Though it is not what the previews lead you, it's still okay. They mix cave men withegyptian wannabe's (they are building pyramids). The plot is just a guy trying to get his girl back. Don't go into it expecting this great blockbuster and you will be okay.
0743289692|5.0|Until it was finished, this book became a part of me--- I could not put it down.  Ayaan's culture was an incomprehensible combination of love, support, backwardness, cruelty, and control.   To watch her grow and develop into an independent and autonomous young lady, was to see a flower beginning to bloom.   It made me thankful for having been born in the USA and for the parents I had.
B00127RAJY|4.0|For all intents and purposes this is a good workout DVD however Jillian Michaels is a super annoying trainer, unfortunately I never watched The biggest loser so I had no idea about her personality which I now regret because if I had known I would have never bought it. I purchased this along with Jackie Warner's DVD which is a far superior workout plus Jackie's ability to be a very effective yet supportive trainer makes the DVD a win win situation. For those who want a very good workout but dont really care about the personality of the trainer I would recommend the 30 day shred otherwise if you want the full package-great workout plus winning personality and support I would definitely recommend Jackie Warner's Workout DVD.
0525950079|3.0|I read The Pillars of the Earth and am now plowing through World Without End. Gritty, earthy and raw, these books depict the town of Kingsbridge, England during two medieval periods.  Follett is a master at depicting the brutal and desperate lifestyles of all echelons of society during the Middle Ages through compelling characters and thorough research, but these are not for the faint of heart.  Both the length of the books and the gory details could be a little off-putting to some readers, but overall, the triumph of the human spirit shines through.<br /><br />I was so looking forward to reading World Without End and so hoping that Follett would have grown as an author in the almost two decades since The Pillars of the Earth.  I am disappointed.  Again, compelling characters and thorough research are the stars of this book, but alas, the same weaknesses as before -- slippages of language where medieval characters sound startlingly modern and historical anomalies that just don't fit.  These, as always, are forgivable when the tale is well-spun and the characters well-crafted.<br /><br />As before, my biggest complaint with WWE is the graphic sexual content that just doesn't fit and is totally unnecessary.  I get that the Middle Ages were brutal.  There was little privacy and the entire cycle of life from birth to death was lived out in almost animal-like desperation except for the privileged few.  This is compelling enough fodder without having to show to the minutest detail every rape, pillage and plunder in all its fantastical gore.  We get it, Mr. Follett.  The Bad Guys were really, really bad.  The lesbian nun sub-plot too, was contrived and unbelievable.  Without giving too much away, the details of lesbian intimacies were unnecessary and could have been depicted in a much more tactful manner than the clumsy, guy/boorish way that Follett chose. Again, titillating tripe.<br /><br />I wrote this for POTE and the same is true for WWE, the gratuitous sex is just garbage, but the main characters are so compelling and enjoyable that you want to spend the 1000 pages with them and will think about their lives long after you have closed the book.  It's just such a shame that Follett had to sully up a great book with smut.acters are so compelling and enjoyable that you want to spend the 1000 pages with them and will think about their lives long after you have closed the book.

B0012QE4Q2|3.0|Luxuriously done and highly entertaining are some of the plus of this historical melodrama that recreates - once again - the tormented relation among Henry VIII and three of his wives. As a precedent, this film has the Alexander Korda's classic THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY VIII with Charles Laughton (1933), Charles Jarrott's ANNE OF THE THOUSAND DAYS (1969) and the ridiculous miniseries THE TUDORS (2007). However, the most direct relation with a previous film comes from a good 2003 T.V movie of the same name, based on the same Philippa Gregory´s novel, and with Jodhi May (Anne), Natascha McElhone (Mary) and Jared Harris (Henry VIII), directed by Philippa Lawthorpe. Thus, this 2008 version is, actually, a big-screen remake from the 2003 TV timepiece.  This new approach to Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII stands with dignity and becomes quite watchable. Natalie Portman is excellent in portraying Anne, as well as Scarlett Johansson in the role of Mary. However, Eric Bana - although a fine actor - is somehow miscasted as the King: he's far from giving even a physical approach to the character (to make this king appear as a sexy, good-looking character is a huge historical mistake), and his acting is not as good as the ones we've seen him (BLACK HAWK DOWN, TROY, MUNICH). The art direction is first rate, as well as the costumes, music and photography. It's a very entertaining timepiece, no matter the historical inaccuracies contained. And don´t forget the 2003 version: it´s as good - or even better? - than this one.

B00125WAXC|5.0|A superb film. Brings the viewer into the 1950s reality of the Jim Crow South and the struggle for equality by Black Americans.  The lessons communicated are applicable to all races, cultures, and communities.  We are engaged by intriguing characters obviously bright and articulate and yet flawed. It is the flaws that we see them strive to overcome as well as the ills of our society. The students stretch their skills to become great debaters with the help of a charismatic and learned professor who pushes his students and himself to be the change agents in their community and the society at large.   A true joy to watch over and over.
B000VS6P9Q|4.0|Let me state upfront that, while I was rather apprehensive of the movie concept as such, I ended up really liking the non-delinear interpretation of Bob Dylan's life by director Todd Haynes. The structure of the film had the potential to turn this into a (well-intended) disaster, but it turned out to be quite the enjoyable surprise. When you watch the film. you hear a lot of Dylan songs, mostly from Dylan himself, and once in a while fragments from Dylan-covers also can be heard. The \\"I'm Not There\\" is a collection of those covers.<br /><br />\\"I'm Not There\\" (2 CDs, 34 tracks; 159 min.) brings 33 covers, many of which do not appear in the movie. I am generally speaking not a great fan of these types of collections (cover songs of big name artists) but must admit that it works quite well here. Among the many highlights on tis collection, my personal favorites include \\"Goin' to Acapulco\\" by Jim James & Calexico (done brilliantly in the movie), \\"One More Cup of Coffee\\" by Roger McGuinn & Calexico, Jeff Tweedy's somber take on \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\", Charlotte Gainsbourg (who stars in the film) whispering-soft version of \\"Just Like A Woman\\", a surprising appearance of the Hold Steady for their cover of \\"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\\", an almost subdued performance of the Black Keys on \\"The Wicked Messinger\\", and a memorable \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" from Karen O (of the Yea Yea Yeas). The very last song brings Bob Dylan himself, doing \\"I'm Not There\\", along with the Band (from the Basement Tapes-era).<br /><br />Bottom line: I was very pleasantly surprised by this album, which is so much more than a soundtrack. The best proof of that is of course that you can play this and it will resonate just as well, whether you've actually seen the movie \\"I'm Not There\\" or not.
B000YAA68W|5.0|\\"Persepolis\\" is based on Marjane Satrapi's autobiographical graphic novels of her childhood and youth in Iran. Satrapi co-directed and co-wrote the film with Vincent Paronnaud, and she is careful to say that it should not be taken as a literal representation of her life, because the narrative technique in film is so different from graphic novels that some liberties are inevitable. The story begins in 1978 Tehran, as 9-year-old Marjane, with a childish and uncomprehending political eye, witnesses the last days of the Shah's regime. Initial optimism turns to fear as the nation's new leadership institutes Draconian reforms. Fearing for their outspoken daughter, Marjane's parents send her to high school in Vienna. After an eventful flirtation with Western culture, Marjane heads back to Tehran for university, family, and more frustration with that nation's oppressive religious regime.<br /><br />\\"Persepolis\\" is created from hand-drawn animation, stark black-and-white foregrounds that tend to be against muted backgrounds. Though the characters are illustrated with relatively simple lines, the texture of other elements in the scenes is often pronounced and inviting. Marjane Satrapi chose to make an animated film in part because she wanted it to be abstract, not identified solely with a particular place and time, and not an \\"ethnic\\" film. She's correct in thinking that animation removes the ethnic quality, even from a film that takes place in a foreign country among people speaking a foreign language. The animation style is thoroughly enjoyable and deceptively simple. The clean lines focus attention on what is important, while peripheral elements create mood.<br /><br />I don't think that \\"Persepolis\\" has anything pointed to say. It expresses one person's experiences with passion and humor. Marjane laments what happened to her family and country. She remarks on the advantages and shortcomings of life in Europe. I think more than a commentary on Iran or oppressive governments, \\"Persepolis\\" expresses the conflicting emotions that immigrants from the developing world to the First World often feel: Contentment and optimism in the new opportunities that they enjoy. Frustration and nostalgia for their native countries that continue to struggle with basic social and economic issues. This is where \\"Persepolis\\" most succeeds and finds itself expressing thoughts and emotions common to millions of people. In French with optional subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony 2008): The film was recorded in French, but the directors also recorded an English version, so you can watch the film in either language or with subtitles in English or Spanish. There are 5 featurettes on the disc. Most are in French with subtitles. \\"The Hidden Side of Persepolis\\" (30 min) is a French making-of documentary. Satrapi takes us behind the scenes to meet the film's animators, cast, and other technicians, who explain their work. \\"Behind the Scenes of Persepolis\\" (9 min) was made for the English version. It interviews the director and some of the American cast. In \\"Cannes Press Conference Q&A\\" (29 min), the directors, producers, and French cast take questions from the press. \\"Selected Scene Commentaries\\" presents 3 sequences with commentary by Satrapi, Paronnaud, or actress Chiara Mastroianni. \\"Animated Scene Commentaries\\" present another 3 sequences plus some tests that were not used, comparing the film to the storyboards, with commentary by Satrapi.expresses the conflicting emotions that immigrants from the developing world to the First World often feel: Contentment and optimism in the new opportunities that they enjoy.

B00008EY65|5.0|First things first, let me say \\"Welcome to the material plane oh Great Red One!\\" The '04 cinematic release of `Hellboy' definitely brought new meaning and dimension (dimension, get it?) to the superhero film genre and the never ending battle between Good and Evil.<br /><br />The storyline contains all the elements the astute comic book fan or student of the esoteric and arcane would expect; nightmarish locations and stormy nights, magical incantations and prophetic utterances of impending doom, animated corpses and demonic entities, portals to the Otherworld and of course plenty of Nazis. Add to the mix the mad monk Rasputin, the awakening ot the Lovecraftian \\"Seven Gods of Chaos\\" and you've got a Cosmic confrontation on your hands that only the likes of Hellboy can withstand.<br /><br />This movie has it all, well developed storyline, superb special effects with an entertaining mixture of action sequences and witty, intelligent dialogue delivering a lot of quotable dialogue. Ron Perlman is absolutely perfect as Hellboy and under the magnificent direction of Guillermo del Toro it was truly a match made in Heaven (sorry, couldn't resist)!
B000OHZL1W|4.0|A truly great older film. This stars Robert Redford and introduces River Phoenix. RP was a young actor with unlimited potential who died at a very young age. Watch this movie. Also stars Sidney Poitier.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Excelent sound track to an excelent movie. cd was in decent condition, a few small scratches here and there but other then that completely satisfactory
B000VBJEFK|5.0|I have to say that this film really surprised me.  What a great movie.  It's got a great cast of characters that you can love, laugh at and in some cases hate.  It's so well paced and written that you forget one of the lead characters happens to be a rat!  It's inventive, interesting, funny, heartfelt and unique.  Not since Nemo have I enjoyed an animated film so much that I immediately wanted to own it.  If you are an animated film fan who loves a good story try this out.  I think fans of Ice Age, and Finding Nemo and the Incredibles will really enjoy this film.  It's just THAT good.
1594489505|5.0|At first I was hesitant to pick up this book after reading The Kite Runner. Not because I didn't like The Kite Runner, on the contrary, I loved it and was certain that A Thousand Splendid Suns would never be quite as good. I am happy to say that I was wrong! This book, like The Kite Runner (though with very different characters and a very different plot), weaves the tale of two strong characters who lives are derailed by cultural customs, societal views and war. You find yourself feeling their pains and struggles and cheering them on, wondering when the \\"Thousand Splendid Suns\\" will appear through the darkness. Eventually though, through their eyes, you see the rays of sunshine even in the most dire of times and you take the journey with them, never wanting to put the book down. A great read!

B0012QE4Q2|1.0|To all the people who seem to think that it's perfectly OK for historical novels to be fictitious works of an overheated imagination:     If you'd search out books by writers who know what they are doing, you would never again waste a nanosecond on pulp writers of Ms. Gregory's ilk. Both the book and the movie are historically inaccurate, absurdly ineffective as entertainment and all-over criminal blasts of hot air. What REALLY happened to Anne Boleyn and the people around her was a thousand times more riveting, sexy, tragic and dramatic than anything presented here. One typical example: when she met Henry, Mary Boleyn was NOT an innocent young bride. She and Anne had both spent years at the French court, where Mary (who was the elder of the two sisters) was so notorious a round-heels that contemporary writers were moved to mention it. And this corrects only one of the dozens of imbecilic falsehoods perpetrated by Ms. Gregory.     For an infinitely better read, check out \\"Brief Gaudy Hour\\" by Margaret Campbell Barnes, \\"The Concubine\\" by Norah Lofts, or even some of Jean Plaidy's less thrilling but serviceable Tudor titles. For film treatments, rent \\"The Six Wives Of Henry The Eighth\\" with Keith Mitchell for the real scoop, or \\"Anne Of The Thousand Days\\" with Genevieve Bujold, which sticks to the gist while taking bit of dramatic license.
B0000542D2|5.0|I think this is the boys best movie ever!  The storyline is basically what a day in the life of a Beatle is (during Beatlemania). Great songs, they look great (still young and without the long hair) and hilarious!  You really get to see each of their personalities. Anyone who loves The Beatles would enjoy this film, young and old.
B0019IB26I|5.0|I have been a Mayer fan since 2000, when we heard him on a little acoustic set on the radio one day.  I have been hooked ever since and he never ceases to amaze me.  Too many people do not realize how incredible an artist he is.  They assume he's just another pop star among the hundreds.  That could not be farther from the truth.  This album proves that 1000 times over.  He is such a versatile musician and through the three different sets consisting of  an acoustic solo set (you'll love \\"In Your Atmosphere\\" and the \\"Free Fallin'\\" Petty cover), a bluesy set with John Mayer Trio which mirrors greats such as SRV and BB King, and then his full band set with Gravity and all the hits, he performs each beautifully and with the talent and professionalism of a legend.  He has a great personality too that shows in his live concerts (and on his blog)and an amazing mind that can be seen in his lyrics.  Not to mention many jaw dropping moments on that guitar as well!  Well, all that to say if you were never a fan, buy this album and let him impress you!  If you are a fan, you have it already!
B000002UAX|5.0|Although I tend to prefer The Beatle's earlier work, this album is one of their best in my opinion.  Double CD and all the songs are great.  Worth every penny!  You really can't go wrong with any Beatle album.

B00001ZWTT|4.0|The grotesquelly underestimated \\"Wild Wild West\\" is surely Barry Sonnenfelds's masterpiece. The problem the typical unresponsive or hostile reviewer seems to me to have had with this very popular 1999 film is an inability to make sense of it for what it is: a burlesque of 19th century Southern quasi-fascism in the guise of retro science fiction in a Jules Verne/H.G. Wells mold. (A kind of Right-rearding political correctness similar to that that marred the crtical response to \\"Brother, Where Art Thou\\" and scuttled the reputation of the rich and worthwhile \\"Hurry Sundown\\" seems at work here.) The film's battle of Black Yankee Will Smith and rebel \\"salon\\" dancer-hooker Selma Hyak against a post-bellum alliance of recent Confederate notables, would-be British Imperialist Civil War allies of the Confederacy and proto fascist Prussian militarists is hilarious.  The action is better paced, as well as more specatacularly conceived, than that of any other Sonnenfeld film. This is a  pop film to evoke the alternative history and retro-science fiction fanatasies of Pynchon's high-art literary masterpieice of late 19th and early 2oth century anarchist.
B00008J4P5|4.0|When I first listened to Elephant, I had no clue who the White Stripes were, or what to expect. Needless to say, I had an open mind. My first thoughts were about the first song, one that I usually skip now because I like the others too much. \\"Seven Nation Army\\" is the kind of song that brings people in, catches their attention. It held mine for quite a while, and I still don't mind listening to it, but compared to the others on the album, I find it around par for the course.<br /><br />  \\"Black Math\\" is another song that sort of draws in people. Quite simply, it had two layers: the first was the catchy song that drew in more fans, and the seconds was decoding the lyrics. Were they actually literal, or was there something else to it?<br /><br />  The next few songs (the 'softer' ones) I didn't quite like at first, although a few listens through (especially when everything was calm) changed my mind: I loved those songs! While I'm part of the younger generation (so go ahead and criticize me for that) I thought several of the lyrics were pretty creative (if not, dare I say, or-ig-in-al), especially on \\"You've Got Her In Your Pocket\\".<br /><br />  I can honestly say I skipped \\"Ball and Biscuit\\" the first several times I heard it. 'Seven minutes?!?' My mind kept saying, 'That won't hold your attention!' I matured a bit (it took maybe two years to start fully appreciating music as a whole), and \\"Ball and Biscuit\\" became my favorite song. Why so I cannot explain, but there is just something about the simplicity of Meg's drumming mixed with Jack's varying guitar assault, how they turn the action up three times, changing it up just a bit every time. Would you believe they were inspired by a hanging microphone?<br /><br />  The other songs were a bit faster paced, and so I caught on to those more quickly, although \\"Hypnotize\\" was an instant favorite, and still is. \\"The Air Near My Fingers\\" kind of builds up to \\"Girl You Have No Faith In Medicine\\"; I liked the latter much better at first, then \\"The Air Near My Fingers\\" grew on me.<br /><br />  As with The White Stripes other albums, it ends on a humorous note with \\"It's True That We Love One Another\\", probably the weakest song on the album, although I don't mind it every once in a while. Just because it's the weakest on the album doesn't make it a weak song, if the album is good. In this case, I definitely think so.<br /><br />  By the way, I would like to point out the live performances by The White Stripes, especially the seven minute hurricane of the Son House cover \\"Death Letter\\". They take the album version, already changed up a bit from the original, and add on some great on-stage chemistry, along with a few killer guitar solos that might change the mind of those disagreeing with Jack White's position on the Rolling Stone's list.<br /><br />  That's it! I hope I could help at least one person with their choice. It's pretty cheap now, so I'd highly recommend it to anyone, especially if you like their other albums.e Air Near My Fingers\\" grew on me.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|Call this one a sleeper.  Not all video clubs got it; Hollywood Video didn't get it so I thought it was a B rated, turn of the century dime novel made for the movies.  Wrong!  This movie was one of the best of the year, if not the best. Renee Zellweger should have received professional recognition for her portrayl of Beatrix Potter, creator of \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\\" and other children's books.  Great for the whole family.  I have no idea how the PG rating was derived; the back of the DVD case said for \\"brief mild language\\" whaatever that means.  I've ordered the movie so we'll be able enjoy it in our family for years to come.
B000VD5I94|2.0|This Blu-ray release of Robocop DOES NOT contain any special features, contrary to what the back cover says.  It is only the movie(Uncut Version), a trailer, and subtitles.  I had expected at the very least the same special features and documentary that are on my friends DVD release.    I do not own the DVD release of Robocop, so I cannot compare the picture and transfer quality of the Blu-ray and DVD.  However after reading about the many different DVD releases of Robocop, the special features alone make the Blu-ray release seem to worth about $5.

For seven years, she has put in long hours, worked through the night and basically gave up her life for the firm.  Samantha thinks it has been worth it because she's about to become a partner.     On the morning her partnership is to be announced, she discovers a memo that was buried on her desk.  The deadline was weeks ago and she is frantic.

She stops at the first house she comes to, only to rest and ask for a drink of water, when she is mistaken for an applicant for the housekeeper position.  Soon Samantha finds herself working as a housekeeper.  Only problem is Samantha doesn't know anything about cooking, vacuuming, chores, etc.  Little does Samantha know, this will put her on the path she's been striving for.

B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Hard Candy is an album that needs time to be enjoyed and liked. I definitely think that. Besides, There are many songs here that can easily be future singles. Let's see:    CANDY SHOP is a great song, full of flavour and fun. I love to sing it! Believe me: It must be a single! I can see Madonna in a candy shop offering her sugar to many people who want to eat some. A colourful video would help. I always thought it should've been the first single.(10/10)    I never liked 4 MINUTES at the beginning. Actually I don't like it very much yet, although it's proved to be a success around he world. Here in MTV LatinAmerica has been in the top ten for many weeks. (6/10)    Oh my God! GIVE IT 2 ME is a great song, very danceable and enjoyable. I don't like the part where she says \\"Get stupid...\\", though. Anyway, I think it's a very good song. I love the video too!(10/10).    HEARTBEAT is also a very good song, one of my favourite. It's the perfect combination of pop and hip hop. (9/10).    MILES AWAY. I love it, great ballad. I think it could've fitted the American Life album, it sounds like that, it belong more to that album than to Hard Candy. I hope it is a single too. Beautiful and touching lyrics. (10/10).    SHE'S NOT ME is a very good song, but there are 2 things I don't like about it. One: it's too long! Two: the part where she says \\"She is licking her lips...\\" It's like 31 seconds that I find very annoying, the rest is perfection. I do hope it is a single too, but an edit version without the annoying part. I think she should mix it with Thief Of Hearts (from the Erotica album) to sing it live on The Sticky And Sweet Tour. (9/10)    INCREDIBLE is not so good, I think. It begins good, but then...(7/10)    BEAT GOES ON. I like it, and I do love the rap by Kanye West. I hope it is a single too. (9/10).    DANCE 2NIGHT is very goooood! I love the chorus, for me it's like very disco or 70's. The rest is not very danceable, but the chorus is really worth it. Another single?(9/10).    SPANISH LESSON...no comments. (3/10).    DEVIL WOULDN'T RECOGNISE YOU is not exactly my thing. (5/10).    VOICES. I listened to it once or twice. I don't like it much. (3/10)    I hope Madonna comes to Peru on her next tour. Am I dreaming?
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Great, great, great album. You can definitely hear the Brian Eno influence but it still feels like Coldplay. It doesn't touch A Rush of Blood...but then again, what does? It's a great album and one of the best I've heard this year.
B0015519VS|5.0|I've always been a fan of Usher. I consider confessions a masterpiece. Here i Stand is by far Usher's best cd of his carrer. You can tell this man has grown up since 2004 and to me the music is better that way. Every single track is a classic. buy this cd you will love it.
B0012Q732O|1.0|I'm sorry, but this movie sucked.  I know or care nothing about history so believe me when I say that it is still a lousy movie whether it is accurate or not.  The action sucked, the love story sucked, the casting sucked, the plot sucked, the wonderful pinball wooly mammoths sucked.  The only cool thing in the whole movie was the big meat eating birds.   It seemed like the plot had too much it was trying to do and it just didn't really get anything done.  Kind of like they just tried to take the best parts of a ton of different movies and still botched the whole thing.

B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I recently checked this cd out from the library and I think its great.While I would buy the lateset releases from Robben Ford or Joe Bonamassa(and have)rather than buy  some newer metal(I turned that task over to my 16 year old son) I have been a fan of Mark Tremonti since the Creed days and have seen ads for this cd in Guitar Player magazine plus an interview with Mark so wanted to give Blackbird a try.I was so happy to hear how good this band is.To me Alter Bridge has all the elements needed for excellent classic sounding metal with a modern edge;Crunchy ballsy sounding riffs(with a few Zakk Wylde approved pick harmonics thrown in) awesome lead work(some nice Schenker influenced wah) and a singer who can actually sing.I wish the local rock radio station(1077 the bone) had the guts to play songs from this cd. It truly seem under appreciated(though I was  happy to see the love given here at Amazon).
B0013D8LCW|5.0|WOW - I absolutely LOVE this movie!  Its sexy, hot and moving!  I laughed, cried and fell in love with these guys! FINALY a gay love story that ends the way you want it to!  NO I wont give away the ending but Im SO happy with how it turns out! Even the local Denver paper called it \\"The best love story of the last decade - gay or straight\\" and thats just the tip of the ice burg! Cant wait to see what this movie team comes up with next!  SHELTER is nothing short of HOT HOT HOT!!!!!!!! At all costs  - BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00177Y9ZC|2.0|This says it all; while the main idea is excellent, there is no explanation - only running around on steroids. Cheap, cliche-y narrative tricks, obviously the producer took the path of least resistance.     And the main actor gets on my nerves, he looks as whiney as he did in Star Wars.
B00005JKED|5.0|(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \\"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\\" Get it at Amazon.)<br /><br />The ending was a bit of overkill.  That could be said.  And the mano-a-mano fight before the ending was a bit drawn out.  That too could be said.  But the rest of the film was more than excellent.<br /><br />\\"Training Day\\" is the best of the bad cop dramas that I have seen, and I've seen a few.  Both Denzel Washington as the psychopathic bad cop, Alonzo, and Ethan Hawke as the idealistic rookie, Jake, were full out.  Denzel Washington won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance, and Ethan Hawke was nominated for Best Supporting Actor.  The direction by Antoine Fuqua was superb.  The LA street scenes and milieu were as real and vivid as my old buddy Taco Bender.  (And trust me, Taco Bender was very real.)  The extras in the crowd scenes should get some kind of prize for macho scary.  I've been there, and I still have a few nightmares.  There are some streets in LA you don't want to walk down unless you are a homey, or a brother, and some other streets you don't want to walk down, period.<br /><br />Unlike some cop dramas and shoot `em up thrillers, this one was carefully planned, so that the scene in the barrio at the card table, the rook all alone set up for the kill, came across as real because what had happened before was just about the only thing in the world that could have saved him.  The LA atmosphere was like a rush, as stunningly authentic in a different way as, say, that in Chinatown (1974) or LA Confidential (1997), but more contemporary.<br /><br />I wonder how many guys starting in say the sixties or maybe a little before have experienced the kind of initiation that Jake experiences in terms of being fed some dope never before tasted and then \\"led\\" on the \\"trip\\" by someone wanting to exploit them.  Most of the time, for most guys it was an initiation into something other worldly, scary, but something that was only psychological and would be gone the next day.  For Jake it was a matter of, first, his livelihood as an idealistic cop, and second a matter of groking to a paranoid view of the world in which the good guys are the bad guys and everything is hopelessly corrupt and there is no good, only evil--and you just found out.  And third, a matter of life and death with either acid and grass running all around your brain or maybe PCP and speed, and some suddenly obviously evil person (as Washington so well depicted) giving you the kind of \\"guidance\\" you can't refuse.  And then finally it is beyond life and death and only a matter of primeval justice and a revenge you must perform.<br /><br />Look for Snoop Dogg in a wheelchair and Dr. Dre as one of Alonzo's posse cops.gical and would be gone the next day.

B00005KB9W|5.0|Bob Marley And The Wailers' Live! (1975) was recorded during their Natty Dread Tour at the Lyceum Ballroom in London, but it feels like Jamaica. The enthusiastic and largely Jamaican crowd obviously loves Bob Marley and his reggae music, and he gives them what they came for. This album is everything a great live album should be.<br /><br />There's an exciting balance of love, exuberance and desperation on Live!. You can hear it and you can feel it. The political and cultural vibes are clearly defined, and there's a strong communal spirit that runs through each and every song. This music can make you happy, and it can make you think. It's electrifying. Trenchtown Rock rocks!<br /><br />The centerpiece on the album is the seven-minute anthemic No Woman No Cry. The improvised audience sing-a-long and the wonderful performance makes it so very clear just what this night meant to everyone who was there.<br /><br />A soulful and rockin' reggae version of I Shot The Sherriff sounds fantastic, and the uplifting Lively Up Yourself is energetically positive and Bob Marley at his best. He gets political with Burnin' & Lootin' and Them Belly Full (But We Hungry), and philosophical with Get Up, Stand Up. Everything here rocks, and the special talent and unique charisma of Bob Marley is not in short supply on Live!. His love for music and enthusiasm for performing is evident in every song.<br /><br />There is a bonus track, Kinky Reggae, where Marley introduces the players on the stage while the band jams. It fits in nicely here and wraps things up well.<br /><br />Live! is a great place to start with Bob Marley. The music is great, and the essence of the man and his legend is clearly experienced when listening to the album. Digitally remastered to sound better than ever, this famous recording of the legendary London concerts really delivers. The lyrics to all of the songs are included along with some great photos from the shows. It's an essential part of the Bob Marley And The Wailers catalog and a must-have for fans, but it really doesn't matter what your favorite music is, this is definitely worth hearing.<br /><br />\\"Lively Up Yourself...\\"ns, but it really doesn't matter what your favorite music is, this is definitely worth hearing.     \\"Lively Up Yourself...\\"

Twister should be shown on HD DVD at the CES show to show this -- Lets hope Europe makes more movies so we can fight over the imports ;)      -- Go HD DVD --    The HD DVD version was more than the Blu Ray - It ended up like an iMax experience - I only wish Bee Movie would make a comeback here.    ;)

B00014NE62|5.0|Love Triumps in this story of two men in turn-of-the-century England. Despite their great differences - one is of noble birth, the other is from the lowly worker class - they find comfort and confidence in each other and a love that, in the end, wins out against the hurdles and hard choices a victorian-age society puts between them... A MUST BUY!
0743290119|2.0|I was anticipating an enjoyable and fun filled reading experience with this book, but I only got as far as the first two chapters before giving up.  I despise not finishing a book I've started, but this book was an exception.  The women in this story are around the age of 30 and trying to resolve their issues in life, but it felt shallow and offensive the way they carried on.  Weisberger did an awesome job with The Devil Wears Prada, hopefully her next book will be a better one.
0307237702|2.0|I am glad I read this book.  I had not decided who to vote for in 2008, and now I am positive that I am not voting for Obama.  Other reviews were encouraged or inspired or thought the tone was hopeful.  I do not agree.  I thought it was a lot of rambling about everything that's wrong with America with the occasional self-congratulatory pot shot at a former running opponent or journalist thrown in.  His solutions tend to be written in terms of what repulicans want to do or tried to do and why he disagrees.  One positive -- the writing is very candid.  I was actually kind of surprised that a presidential hopeful would reveal this much in print.  You can at least get a very clear view of who he thought he was when he wrote this book -- which leads me to point out another surprise of mine, why aren't his opponents using more of the stuff in this book against him?

B0016B6ZKG|3.0|Donna Summer has always felt conflicted about her being typecast (as a talented vocalist of mere \\"dance music\\"), about her fame, and about some of her hard-core (and HARDCORE) fans. After a seventeen year hiatus, Donna heralds her royal return!  In a noble effort to recapture some of her past glory,  Dance-Floor Donna sings (with obvious references to her earlier decadent Disco Diva days): \\"So many years ago on the radio, she crept into ya soul and loved to love ya all...The Queen is Back!\\"  Well, partly.<br /><br />One gets the strong impression that DS has resented her being pigeonholed by fans and the music industry with the \\"Queen of Disco\\" moniker and all its associations, and has persistently tried to peck out of this disco/dance cage with forays into other, more \\"respectable\\" musical categories. Yet, despite her tenacity, she has never really attained the popular and financial heights she once knew whenever straying too far from these familiar genres. She crows, \\"Fame made a fool out of everyone...It's all about who they think you are,\\" and  \\"Let me introduce myself.  I'm a woman that you've never seen.  You might know me from somewhere else as someone that I've never been.\\"<br /><br />Her Majesty seemingly wants to reclaim her crown while at the same time implying she'd like to abdicate her throne!  Our Queen, perhaps, but a reluctant, conflicted Queen.<br /><br />Despite repeated efforts to expand her musical repertoire in the past, these have mostly been fair to failing commercial diversions. (Donnapologists may disagree.)  While promising \\"the Queen is Back!\\" on *Crayons*, she nevertheless tries the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach again---with mixed results. The album starts off with great fanfare, full of the energy, freshness and passion we have missed, as she tries on varied contemporary dance music styles. However, more than halfway into the album, the excitement peters out, plummeting into generic, lackluster, indistinguishable filler of dance numbers, pop tunes and ballads, unworthy of our Grande Dame. While listening to her gravelly impersonation of Tina Turner in Track 9 may be a hoot, her \\"stretch marks\\" throughout the CD are most embarrassingly revealed here.<br /><br />So, does she feel unfairly bound to restrict her God-given talent mainly to fan-friendly dance fluff?  Rumors also persist about her love/hate/love relationship with a sizable portion of her fan base after finding religion: gay men.  The story goes she loves the sinners, hates the sin, loves the sinners' money. After 17 years of mounting bills, is this CD just Donna's most recent attempt of holding her nose while going in for another financial dip at the same stagnant-watered well?  Heaven Knows?<br /><br />(The Royal) \\"We\\" are glad the Queen is back.  Unfortunately, her tiara has lost much of its former regal glitter.and ballads, unworthy of our Grande Dame.

B000Y1ZXUM|4.0|This is one of the best blu-ray DVD I have. The concert, show, song everything is awesome. Picture was phenomenal. The 2channel LPCM uncompressed audio is excellent. However, the Dolby Digital 5.1 track is inadequate at best. The DD 5.1 track often dropped off the side vocals (like in hips don't lie). So if you have DD 5.1 receiver than you may not fully enjoy the 5.1 channel track. That's my only gripe about this Blu-Ray DVD.
B000B5IPDI|5.0|This review is about the version with the brown cover with a leafless tree behind the black letters BIG FISH. It contains two things: the exact same movie you get for a dollar more than half the price of this version and a hardbound booklet. The booklet contains thirteen pages with one or two sentences on it, and ten pages with a drawing or picture. That's it. If you think such a booklet is worth collecting, go for it. I'd rather collect used tea bags. There are hundreds of reviews of the movie Big Fish. I'll just say that any flick that can make me laugh, cry, say \\"wow!\\", think \\"aw, that's sweet!\\", jump in surprise and watch again as soon as I've finished seeing the first time is a movie well worth buying. I just wish I'd bought the cheaper version, without the booklet. See a longer review for more details about the movie. Or rent it. Or wait for it to be shown on tv again. The internet movie database will tell you if it's on soon. Better yet, just buy it. It's a wonderful, delightful, very unusual movie.
6305212112|3.0|I loved \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" at the theater and the old VHS video version (which is the only version on which you can see the original theatrical release), but unfortunately, both DVD versions insert extra scenes which ruin some of the seemless transitions between flashbacks and present-time which were the hallmark of \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\".  The extra scenes aren't even particularly good, and this DVD provides no original version without them.  This criticism is true for both the Widescreen Collector's Edition and the Anniversary Edition.  I'm deeply disappointed, and hoping Universal will one day release the original theatrical version of the film on DVD.  What a shame it would be for the theatrical version of \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" to one day disappear.
B000062XFG|3.0|On balance, the second season of TNG was a big step forward.  Everything about TNG, especially the acting and writing, had improved greatly over the show's first year. At the same time, the writers hadn't quite figured out how to consistently write good, much less great, episodes.    Whereas most of the main characters were, at best, rough sketches in the 1st season, most of them finish the second season quite similar to what they would be in the rest of the series.  Only Worf would have a substantial way to go.  In addition, three new characters are introduced -- Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Chief O'Brien (Colm Meaney) and Dr. Pulaski (Diana Muldaur).  While Muldaur's character was never on the show long enough to fully adapt, and in general I prefer Gates McFadden, she definitely improved and was not the disaster that some fans suggest.    This season is definitely highlighted by \\"The Measure of a Man\\" (a series classic by any measure) and \\"Q Who\\" (which introduces the fan-favorite villain Borg), as well as the underrated \\"Time Squared\\".  There are also a handful of other very good episodes.  The rest of the season is generally unremarkable, generally better than season 1 but weaker than later seasons.  Special criticism should be reserved for the awful \\"Shades of Grey\\", but it's worth noting that this exceptionally bad episode is not representative of the season as a whole.    Overall, everybody but hardcore fans could skip owning this season - though the better episodes are definitely worth watching.
B000P7V45S|5.0|A TRICK OF THE TAIL is one of Genesis' finest albums ever. Phil Collins takes the reins of lead singer from Peter Gabriel with vigor and sweep, but with something else Gabriel didn't quite have---warmth. Collins' vocals on MAD MAN MOON and RIPPLES have a simple grace to them that I don't think Gabriel would've quite been able to match, although on the louder pieces (DANCE ON A VOLCANO, SQUONK and ROBBERY, ASSAULT AND BATTERY) he more than holds his own with the same declamatory style of singing Gabriel employed. Steve Hackett, Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford and Collins (in the drum chair) more than retain the ensemble feel they'd honed during the 4 previous albums on which they'd played together. You get the sense that nothing feels out of place here and that the band is functioning more AS a band than before.<br /><br />I wish they'd continued down this road instead of going off into the \\"hit singles\\" arena, but such is life. There really isn't a bad track in the whole album, the extras that come with this new reissue are all worth it, and, now as then, ATOTT just might feature Genesis at their best as a band.

B0018CWEYY|4.0|I have 2 concerns about this release... 1st, I agree with so many of you that the studio should not reward our loyalty as fans in spite of the strike shortened season by over charging us this way... but I am almost more concerned about the aspect ratio... are they really cheapening our viewing experience by selling us only full screen (1:33:1)?... After all, the 1st 3 seasons are widescreen, yes?  - If this is true, I will not buy this at any price... I suggest we all go on strike together until they reprice this fairly AND bring us widescreen... who's with me? YEAAAAAAAAAAA..... (as I run from the room with my fist in the air defiantly... gulp...

0515141429|5.0|Lee Child`s creation is brilliant for a series of books, the transient Jack Reacher finds himself in tiny Margrave, Georgia, and is almost immediately arrested, if briefly, as a murder suspect. Imagine his surprise when he discovers that one of the victims is his brother, a brilliant U.S. Treasury agent. Reacher himself is no slouch; a former military policeman, he can dispatch villains with an astonishing array of weapons, including various parts of his body. In the company of a straight-arrow detective and a beautiful lady cop, Reacher soon unearths a conspiracy stretching through the little town and beyond. Blood flows freely, terrible threats are made and carried out, and body parts accumulate. First novelist Child, a former television writer, stretches coincidence outrageously in this would-be noir outing, whose hero is creepily amoral, violent, and generally unpleasant. As a published author myself I`m in awe of Child`s talent.
0385340567|1.0|Did Lee Child even write this book? Like many other devoted Jack Reacher fans I'm very disapointed in the politicizing of JR. Whoever the writer was, he/she has effectively ruined the Jack Reacher character for me. I'll never buy another Lee Child book. So Lee, you did have \\"Something to Lose\\".
B000EPFVDW|5.0|Lee Child has taken reacher into another situation not of his own making. H estumbles into a kidnap by accident. Jack Reacher is in both the wrong and the right place at the same time when FBI Special Agent and daughter of the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Holly Johnson is abducted from a Chicago street. It is the wrong place because Reacher, a former army major drifting around the country, is kidnapped as well. It is the right place because only he has the instincts to foil the complex, deadly plan of the kidnappers, a Montana militia group headed by a charismatic, brilliant, but psychotic leader. Child's tale, very well read by Dick Hill, engrossingly portrays Reacher's efforts to manipulate the captors; the behind-the-scenes maneuvering of the FBI, the army, and the White House; and the many unexpected roadblocks thrown in his path. As usual he right all the wrongs and leaves town without a trace, marching into the next Reacher novel. Excellent.
1400063515|2.0|Nicholas Taleb has seemingly spent his entire life chasing what he refers to as the black swan.  A series of highly improbable events that have continuously shaped the course of human history.  He presents his description of this phenomenon in what might be termed an autobiographical manifesto of sorts, the exhaustive and seemingly endlessly referenced book, \\"The Black Swan -- The Impact of the Highly Improbable\\".  It's not that Taleb isn't onto something, or hasn't written a thought provoking book, he has. But Taleb has not given us a black swan.  He has given us a Red Herring.  He has taken a small piece of stinky fish and dragged it in the dirt perpendicular to the path we are on.  There is a small benefit, if we leave our path momentarily to gain a new perspective, new insights will emerge, but that is all our feeble brains can comprehend, and nothing more.  But to believe there are no thinker's among us who do not understand the need to search for the extraordinary and to try to link them to potential causes, that although we might not understand completely, are contributory and can indeed be rectified, is not to be an observer of the human race at all.  Ultimately he is wrong about the Black Swan but he is right about the requirement for us to think outside the box.  But this has been said before.  Taleb just reminds us.
1593080255|5.0|Oscar Wilde's classic gothic tale of a man who is granted his wish to remain forever young is still a fine and compelling read. Dorian Gray is captured at the height of his physical charms in a painting and soon discovers that the corruption of his body and soul is reflected in the painting while he retains his youthful attractiveness. His life becomes one of increasing debauchery and narcissism.<br />The most quotable of authors, Wilde uses a friend of the young man to deliver an endless collection of axioms and witty observations that add another dimension to the plot.<br />As Gray becomes more convinced of his invincibility he grows more callous toward others and his actions become less human and more monstrous as the story progresses.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Warner Brothers has gone all out in theit DVD presentation of 1938's The Adventures of Robin Hood starring Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland. Robin Hood is one of the greatest examples of Technicolor film making from Hollywood's Golden Age. The great thing about this film is that at 70 years old it does not feel dated. It is an hour and forty minutes of pure escapism. What you see is what you get. There are no hidden agendas no subtexts just simple romance and swashbuckling adventure.    The film was perfectly cast with a young Flynn as the lead but kudos need to be given also to Basil Rathbone, Claude Rains, and Alan Hale. The score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold won the Academy Award that year and is still a great example of how effective scoring enhances a film experience. The direction by Michael Curtiz and William Keighley is crisp and strong.    The highlight of the presentation is Warner's selection of extras that really places the film in perspective. There is an audio commentary by Rudy Behlmer that is one of the best that I've heard. Included is  Leonard Maltin's Warner Night at the Movies 1938 which attemps to present the film as it would have been back then with trailers, short subjects and cartoons. The package includes the hour long documentary Technicolor Glorious Technicolor that gives an insiders view of the film process.    This is one of those classic films that needs to be seen and Warner Brothers is to be complemented for putting together such a great package.

B0019GOT2Y|5.0|I like all 3 Shinedown albums, but this one is definitely my favorite.  I think it's the best showcase of all their strongest elements put together.  Great musicianship with heavy guitars, great melodies and amazing harmonies, not to mention some extremely clever and well crafted lyrics.  If you like anything you've heard from these guys, I highly recommend this album.  And \\"Son of Sam\\" alone is worth the price of this edition.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|This is not as good as the others, but still, I love the movie. The graphics, stunts, etc. were fantastic! I think fans will love the movie.
B00003CX95|1.0|I have never understood Hollywood's need to take actual history which is exciting in  itself and change it. The attempt is often horribly misleading and down right insulting. As a member of the Wallace \\"family\\" we weren't a kilted clan. I'm insulted  they could take such rich history of a man, and a country  and dumb it down for the masses and to think a Wallace was part of this abuse was further insulting. The dates, people and events were all skewed to make this a blockbuster $$ maker and be damn the history. One wonders why if the history was so great, why change it on the big screen.  But it wasn't only the inaccuracies of Wallace's life and history but they couldn't even get the production right..<br /><br />The piper is playing a great war pipe but the sound/music we hear is a bellows pipe, the uilean pipes played in Ireland. Well Duh!!  And \\"first night\\" privileges  give me a break not in Scotland, a flirtation with Isabella? she was a child born in apprx 1295 (she would have been 10 at his death and the age to marry in Scotland was 12) and wasn't married to Ed 2 until years  after Wallace was dead and a kilted Wallace, as a Ayshireman  I highly doubt it nor were the Scots savage peasents. My God they (Borders and lowlands) had a strong economy with mainland Europe since the 1100's and were aware of a world outside their own as well as fashions, so though there were peasants in Scotland,  William Wallace's family wasn't one of them.<br /><br />Want a better portrayal of Scottish history find a copy of CHASING THE RED DEER, different period but much more realistic.  Save you $$ and time a read a good book on Wallace.
1595141715|2.0|my sister tossed me the book, and after reading the book jacket, i was intrigued with what i thought was a very interesting premise.  it vaguely reminded me of another book i loved (as simple as snow, by gregory galloway).    so i read it...think it took me two days.  and let me tell you...it was extremely annoying.  here's why...      first of all, every time i started to enjoy hannah's monologue, it would be constantly interrupted by clay thinking something stupid like \\"there's a sudden ache inside my chest,\\" or best of all, when he is not thinking, but becomes so overcome, he pukes.  give me a break. or when he rakes his hand across a metal fence in frustration and tears some of his skin.     please mr. asher! can i read for five minutes and develop any sort of flow without having clay interrupt? no? didn't think so. but thought i might ask anyway.    and if that wasn't annoying enough...hannah's reasons for suicide?? oh my goodness.  all i can say, is that if the experiences in this book were that traumatic that they caused someone to commit suicide, then at least 25% of every high school class in america should be looking for a way to end it too.    look, i loved the idea about getting the tapes, and then passing them on.  i LOVED when clay would interact with others who had already received the tapes, but there just wasn't any flow to the story. and i hated how in the end, you were left with this resentment for many of the characters, especially mr. poter, who was simply set up by hannah to be the final fall guy.
B0010358CG|5.0|it amuses me that there's always a handful of people who can give a 1 star rating for just about anything. if you wanted to watch shakespeare in the park then you're to blame - not the people who created this awesome work. the animation is incredible, the action scenes are fantastic, the repeat viewability is very high. if you're looking for serious brain stimulation, do sudoku. if you want to enjoy a fun animated film - this is 5 stars for sure.

B00168OINA|5.0|What took the movie studios so long? Huh?<br /><br /> Whatever the case is, after a long and agonizing 19-year wait and several movie franchises to come along in that intervening time, the Indiana Jones movie saga makes a marvelous and glorious resurgence with the fourth entry and second sequel to \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\". Entitled \\"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\", this fourth addition is a marvelous successor to the \\"Last Crusade\\".<br /><br /> 19 years later, it is 1957 and the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union is ongoing. After foiling the Nazis quest to gain a hold of the Holy Grail, Indiana has returned to being a full time professor. However, the Cold War has unleashed a small hornets nest of Soviet KGB spies on U.S. soil. A convoy of Soviet KGB agents has captured Indiana Jones and his sidekick named Mac because they are seeking possession of an ancient artifact called the Crystal Skull. According the legend, the skull was separated from thirteen skeletal figures at an ancient temple in Central America and has been waiting to be returned. A convoy of Spanish conquistadors vanished centuries ago looking for the crystal skull. The agents believe that the crystal skull contains knowledge of everything that is possible to know about both the physical and paranormal and spiritual worlds. The agents are aiming to acquire it to use as a new weapon in waging psychological warfare against the Americans and their allies in Europe and elsewhere. Now Indiana must keep the artifact from being in possession of the Soviet Union before it's too late.<br /><br />Many of the elements from \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" that made it great are carried over onto this movie for many reason, not least of which is that we see the long-awaited return of Marion Ravenwood who was absent for 27-years from the franchise. We also see the addition of a feisty rebel named Mutt Williams who turns out to be more than what Indy is immediately aware of in the short run. In fact, I had high expectations for \\"Crystal Skull\\" and it actually surpassed them. It is already my favorite movie of 2008 and is destined to be added to the list of classics in line with it's three predecessors. The return of Marion Ravenwood is really great to see. It makes me wonder about the fate of Willie Scott from \\"Temple of Doom\\" and where she went though.<br /><br /> The cast is great. To my complete surprise, Harrison Ford, despite being 65 years old, looks no different and hardly less sprightly than he did in \\"Last Crusade\\" and and while certainly a bit slower than in the past, the slower nature of an older Indy is brilliantly played out such as when he attempts to swing on his whip to land on a speeding vehicle misses badly. Irina Spalko in my opinion is an improvement of sorts on her Nazi predecessor Elsa Schneider. Where as Elsa comes off as either really insecure or extremely narcissistic in nature at times, Irina has a far more formidable and more austere persona that could either be a cruel-spirited villainess or as a powerful persona that could come from someone who has duties that fundamentally collide with Indy's quest.ons for \\"Crystal Skull\\" and it actually surpassed them.

B00005KBJK|5.0|In spite of being a monophonic recording (1954), Fricsay's version is a very fluid, brilliant, beautiful, incisive, and very theatrical one. The scene of Tamino with the Sprecher in the Temple of Wisdom has a Greek grandeur. The whole version is a beautiful combination of grace and charm with philosophical seriousness. Fischer-Dieskau is superb as Papageno; Haefliger, an excellent Tamino: he shows why he was Fricsay's favourite tenor; Maria Stader, with her fresh and lyrical soprano voice, is a very sensitive Pamina; Rita Streich, as the Queen of the Night, is one of the best in records because of the full command of her coloratura; Josef Greindl, an impressive Sarastro, as well as Kim Borg as the Sprecher. Fricsay at his best. Highly recommendable.
B00005JPD0|5.0|I'm not going to add a description as previous posts have done it justice. However, I just saw this move (yes, I know - 2 year later) and it is ridiculously good. I love the whole time travel twists in movies and it's up there with Frequency for me. If you like action or time travel twists Deja Vu is a must see. Enjoy.
B000YABIQ6|3.0|The show itself is fabulous.  And I'm pretty sure most of the people hitting this page would agree.  Otherwise, why else would you be here?  You've seen the show, you love it, and you just want to know whether or not to buy the DVD.<br /><br />Yes, you totally should.  Because the show's brilliant, and therefore you should support it.<br /><br />The packaging is horrendous.  It looks awesome.  Zippo lighter shooting out flames.  The flames are the problem though.  You have to be really careful taking the discs out (set up stadium style) as you're going to get your fingerprints all over them.  And you have to be super careful closing the box, as the way it's set up, you end up scratching the discs.
B0013J30W2|2.0|This isn't a movie, it's a buffet; it goes through the list of big Hollywood blockbusters and picks bits off a few of its favorites.  And that's not always bad, but it depends on what movies are being picked.  I was actually okay with it when it was cherry-picking the best of [[ASIN:B000AP04FG Mr. & Mrs. Smith]], and [[ASIN:B00000K19E The Matrix]], and [[ASIN:B000FQJAJG The Empire Strikes Back]], and [[ASIN:B00005JNJV Batman Begins]], and I was even okay when it was harvesting bits from [[ASIN:B000AP04L0 Office Space]] and [[ASIN:B000MGBLFK The Drew Carey Show]].  I think when it was approaching the climax and it started picking up bits from [[ASIN:B0000AZT78 Willard]] that it crossed the line for me.<br /><br />James McAvoy does a remarkable job making the transition from schlub to superhero, possibly the best transformation we've seen since Christopher Reeve first took off those glasses and became Superman.  And while Anjelina Jolie is basically playing the same character she played in Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Tomb Raider, it's an engaging character that makes good use of her hot figure and inherent athleticism.  Of the other cast members, Morgan Freeman is the only one who demonstrates more than one character trait, but come on, in an action flick like this, how diverse of a character do you really need?<br /><br />The basic problem is that it can't decide what kind of movie it's trying to be.  Is it an action film?  A character conflict?  A Hong Kong chop suey dust-up?  It starts out like a broad comedy, but it loses sight of its sense of humor at the end of Act One and becomes aggressively maudlin (what a paradox).  At the finale it even tries to tack on a remarkably unearned moral, like we're supposed to learn something profound from a kid who would destroy an entire passenger train full of people just to get one guy.<br /><br />Moreover, much of the narrative rests on surprise revelations that are neither surprising nor revelatory, and on twists so well-worn that regular filmgoers could practically write the script based on me telling you the three major points the filmmakers try to conceal.  This picture uses slick visuals and stylish fight scenes to make up for the fact that there is not one original or novel idea to be had from beginning to end.  By combining a paint-by-numbers script with vacuous characters and stilted dialog, this film gives us the very epitome of why film buffs are so weary of Hollywood in the Twenty-First Century.<br /><br />I previously praised the film Mr. and Mrs. Smith because it knew exactly how dumb a film it was, and was willing to just have fun with that fact.  This movie knows how dumb it is and seems to feel ashamed of it, like the village idiot who memorizes the Cliff's Notes on Plato to try and pass in cocktail conversation.  Comic book fans may be willing to rent this one when it comes out on DVD, but I cannot in good conscience recommend actually going to see this one in the cinema.  It's just not worth the time.ld practically write the script based on me telling you the three major points the filmmakers try to conceal.

0143038583|5.0|Simply put, if I could force one book upon every living soul, this would be the one.  I don't see how anyone couldn't learn something at the very least, and more than likely it will change your way of thinking to some degree. It would bring the industrialized food market to its knees if even a percentage of people took this book to heart as much as I have.

0790729407|1.0|This review is not concerned with the film itself - but rather its presentation on DVD. First of all, the disc is packaged in the much maligned Warner Bros. cardboard snapcase - which is easily damaged and impossible to replace short of simply buying another copy of the title.<br /><br />Secondly, it is a double-sided disc and the film is broken up into two parts. As it always is with films released on DVD in this manner (GETTYSBURG, SCHINDLER'S LIST) the break is quite sudden and disruptive to the movie-watching experience.<br /><br />It's a shame this title has not been re-released with these issues addressed. There are a multitude of films much longer than MICHAEL COLLINS that have fit onto one single-sided disc (LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and SEVEN SAMURAI spring to mind).<br /><br />Still, it's a budget priced title and - most significantly - the only manner in which to enjoy the film on DVD as the time of this writing.<br /><br />For the record, the fifty minute documentary that is included on the DVD is rather interesting and much appreciated.
B00004XPPK|4.0|In film noir, usually the spider-woman (the gorgeous Rita Hayworth) traps the man with her seductive powers, often getting him to kill for her before she herself is killed/punished for her crimes of transgressing in a man's world. This film doesn't quite follow the formula. The movie stars two male protagonists who are clearly more interested in each other than in Gilda, even though Rita Hayworth is by far one of the most beautiful women ever to be filmed.    Recently restored for DVD release, the film looks sharp and the graininess is gone from the original. Except for the inconsistent use of shadows, the dark/light style is quite honed. The sound quality is high but the amplitude is low, so you will have to turn your speakers up to hear the film clearly.    I admit that I laughed through much of the film as the heterosexual, homosexual, AND bisexual playfulness of the dialogue is simply a joy to listen to, mostly due to Hayworth's goddess-ness. The film ends on a boring, unbelievable moment, but it's typical Hollywood of the time: Good starts, great middles, dumb endings.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|From the beginning to the end this album just rocks. After hearing Low, The Gathering and now Formation of Damnation, this is the New Testament that we have waited for. Keeping to the true style of the Bay Area Thrash this band has only progressed themselves to a higher level. From Thrash albums (NWO, PWYP) the ritual is a good listen but kinda lost me through the sound of trying to sound radio friendly. Then came Return to the Apocalyptic City, a refreshing live mini album that made me wait in suspense for Low. Demondogs! They did what alot of other bands from their era tried to do, keep it heavy at a level that would please the fans. Above and beyond the call, Testament have made a new refreshing start with TFOD, hopefully we don't have to wait 9 years for the follow up. Play on Legion of the Dead!!
B000AARKOO|3.0|Kingdom of Heaven confronts religious extremism as the bane of all evil. Using the Crusades as a backdrop, Christianity and Islam square off nearly 1000 years ago just as the major religions of the world do today. Battles over Jerusalem and concerns about what the city means to the world have been at the center of much human suffering for centuries. The tone of the film is greatly enhanced because its main character isn't particularly religious, and the film dissuades the viewer from taking sides, creating no demonized enemy, but rather a mesh of human beings being humans. Thus, this film is a true epic about our actual lives and histories and not about those men of virtue and bravery and evil and cowardice who exist only as abstracted myth.    Unfortunately, Orlando Bloom is cast in this film. He simply does not have the charisma to carry a movie as its star. He has only one or two expressions throughout the entire film, and he is completely surrounded by great actors who make him look silly. This drags the movie down for me, because he has a lot of screen time. I love the ideas behind the film, but I don't like it when I'm watching a film and just know that I'm watching an actor try to act and fail.  I have yet to see a convincing performance by Bloom and cannot understand why he is so popular. At least someone like Keanu Reeves has charm despite his inability to act consistently.    The romance is completely copied and pasted. Boring.    In the end, the film is average to me.  It tells a familiar tale, but I will admit that the timeliness of the film is at least interesting.
0141439807|4.0|The first half of the book was kind of slow, but by the middle I couldn't put it down!  It was wonderful and had a few surprises.  I am trying to read all of Jane Austen's books...so far I have only read this, Pride and Prejudice, and Emma.  I would have to say I like both P&P and Emma better than Mansfield Park, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this book!
B000AWYOGE|2.0|Dark Water is great at manufacturing tension using a contemporary project (apartment) complex as the source of shadows, dim and yellow light, strange noises, and black-colored water. The tension is level almost from the beginning of the movie until the end, and rarely is there a scary moment to break it. Even the comic relief of the daughter is unintentional as she plays with her toys in the bathtub -- although she steals this scene, it is due to her personality, not the script.    This film is largely plotless. It's also not entirely a character sketch, as many plotless movies can be. For a horror movie to be a character sketch is risky and quite interesting. For a horror movie to have no plot is downright suicidal. The movie fails mostly because it lacks a believable sequence of events. The relationships between the characters are well-developed and the cast is quite good, but there's nothing for them to do. Look scared, be scary, but why? And the utter non-ending is truly thoughtless -- the film ultimately has no regard for the audience.    I suspect that much of the problem has to do with translation. Not Japanese to English, but rather Japanese sensibility to Hollywood sensibility. Something is missing here, a finger on something important. After all, the best horror movies are about our worst fears. Who is afraid of dark water stains?
0784011680|4.0|Robert Downey Jr. nailed it! A wonderful well done movie! I think any Charlie Chaplin fan would appreciate it.
B00139B39E|5.0|First off, I would like to say that Dream Theater is one of the greatest bands of all time!  If it weren't for them, I'd still be stuck listening to the mainstream crap that's being played today.  On to the review....    I've been reading a lot of reviews about this compilation and trying to decide whether to purchase this album or not.  I already have all of their studio albums (minus \\"When Dream and Day Unite\\") so purchasing this album wasn't really necessary.  But there are remixes of songs as well as edited versions...and also an unreleased song.  Well, after hearing a short clip from the \\"Pull Me Under\\" remix, I decided to buy the album.    A couple of issues to address...what many, many people fail to realize is that this is NOT supposed to be a \\"Best of...\\" album...obviously because they left out their more epic songs there are best known for.  As stated by Mike Portnoy himself, the point of this album is to lure new fans in as well as give a little something to existing fans.  Personally, I'm thankful that this band takes extreme consideration to their fans by adding additional content like the remixes and edits...otherwise this WOULD be pointless to buy for the existing fan.  But the main goal is to give a little taste of what Dream Theater is about and (here's what most people fail to realize) give the new curious listener the opportunity to dig deeper to buy their other albums.  Think about it...this is basically a musical appetizer and the existing catalog is the main course.  You don't to fully indulge yourself before hitting up the main dish!  So putting all the more epic songs in this compilation album will ruin the listener's appetite to learn more about the band's songs.  For example, if Dream Theater decided to put, say, \\"Dance of Eternity\\", \\"A Change of Seasons\\", \\"Octavarium\\", and the like into the compilation album, what's left for the new listener to look forward to when buying their other albums?  I think this album is used most effectively when being introduced by an already existing fan.  If a newbie were to pick up this album, none of the aforementioned information might be apparent.  So if you're trying to get your friends into this amazing band (and you should!) get this album and give them a little taste...    From what I've heard so far (I've only listened to most of \\"The Dark Side\\" and haven't gotten to the other disc yet) I am very pleased at what I am hearing.  First of all, the remixes?  Completely blown away!!!  Just from hearing the short clip of \\"Pull Me Under\\" in the trailer I could already tell a world of a difference!  I did a brief comparison between the original and remixed versions of the song and was just amazed at the improvement of the sound quality.  Even though it was a classic (still is, of course!) a facelift was definitely refreshing.  I personally fail to see how an avid listener of Dream Theater can't hear the difference; it's so obvious (my personal opinion)!  To start, the drums don't sound so \\"80's\\" anymore, the new sound of snare drum was what first amazed me...so tight and crisp!  The guitars sounded heavier and the vocals were clearer!  This was just from listening in my car so I'm sure if I listened through headphones I can find other aural nuances I didn't notice in the original.      The Edits....I'll be honest, I was a little shocked about hearing shortened versions of \\"Home\\" and \\"Misunderstood\\" I was completely thrown off!  A lot of the repeated riffs and been shortened...\\"Home\\" especially was weird to listen to, I felt like I was listening in fast-forward.  But keeping in mind the goal of this album, I thought it was clever to remove some elements from the edited songs (for instance, \\"Home\\" starts right away at the heavy part completely skipping the acoustic guitar parts in the beginning and REALLY shortening the music before the vocals come in...from what I remember, they also removed the spoken part [\\"I remember the first time she came to me...\\"] and the slow part in the middle with the sitar/keyboard solo as well as the casino/orgasm solo, lol!)    Ok, I REALLY think I went overboard on the review...just felt like I had to address the issue of the misconception of the album...Hope this helps anyone and go help find more fans!
0316024597|5.0|It's great to have a new David Sedaris book to read or listen to. He is as entertaining as ever, his stories are so original, and there is plenty to make us laugh out loud again. His work brings us great joy.
0743289692|5.0|What a thoughtful and inspiring book this was!  Ms. Ali writes in a very engaging and direct style that makes for a hard-to-put-down biography/self-discovery book.  After finishing this great book, one can only admire this woman for her courage to think for herself, change her whole way of life, and watch as her family disowned and alienated her.  She was able to see Islam for what it is--a disastrously out-of-touch system set in place to suppress women, full of ridiculous mythology.  Ms. Ali rightfullly shows that Islam countries are far behind Western countries in economic well being, human rights, and learning.    One, I think, must also consider X-ianity during the reading of Infidel.  Could there be verses telling women to be quiet in the X-tian Quran?  Could there be verses in the X-tian \\"holy\\" book where god commands men to r@pe women?  Could x-tianity be a silly bunch of myths, hundreds of years old (just like Islam!), that shackle its adherents from growing intellectually and morally?    Infidel is a fantastic book by a true, modern-day hero.  I'm so glad I read Ms. Ali's memoir, and I can't wait to see what she'll say next.  Highly recommended!
0156027321|2.0|The plot line is so compelling - fascinating - I would so love to get inside the author's head .. or thought I would until I read the scenes about Richard Parker eating fish, animals or humans ... or any of the savagery perpetrated amongst the animals ... and it so overshadowed the interest in the book.  All I can say is, \\"ewwwww!\\"
B00005JLYW|3.0|It must be nice to remember so fondly the good ole days when all movies were chock full of plot, dialogue, and meaning. Who can forget those sci-fi and horror classics, Ronald Reagan and the chimp classics, or Doris Day masterpieces that were so real, so full of thought-provoking dialogue, and so powerfully driven by their ironclad plots? Must be nice to have such a selective memory. As for me, I know that Hollywood is by and large a crap factory and it's simply a matter of the flavor you choose. If Charlie's Angels Full Throttle is anything it is a harmless bit of cinematic fun. I'm not stupid as some reviewers suggest because I enjoyed it. In fact, I dare say that calling someone stupid because they like something so innocuous is, well, stupid, but I digress.<br />I found this franchise and in particular this installment highly amusing, entertaining, and fun to watch and I've seen it a good half dozen times on tv here and there and I enjoy it every time. Bernie Mac is his irascible funny self, Demi Moore plays the villain with relish and joy, the cameos by the Wilson brothers, Crispin Glover, et al are additional cheese, and the ladies do a good job as fun-loving butt-kicking detectives. Let's remember we're talking about an MTV version of a tv show that was little more than an excuse for prime time soft core titillation. Anyone who attempts to argue the strength of the original series is also the same person who will tell you that Playboy is really best enjoyed for the articles.<br />If you went into this movie looking for anything other than beaucoup explosions, cartoon action sequences, and painfully corny dialogue than you missed the boat completely. We're talking mindless amusement and not high art and in Hollywood's long history, they've always done much more of the former than the latter if for no other reason than because movies are ENTERTAINMENT FIRST AND FOREMOST. Get over yourself already.

B000YABIQ6|4.0|AMC once again proves itself a worthy adversary to HBO and Showtime for producing a quality and highly literate television experience. Time spent viewing \\"Mad Men\\" is not a passive couch potato exercise calculated to generate a momentary knot of personal nostalgia. The experience is much more than that. Like \\"The Apartment,\\" a major motion picture released in 1960 and mentioned in this series captures the very essence of big city urban 1960 culture and is utterly convincingly in ways both broad and subtle. The look and feel of the time is spot on. Some of what is defined in \\"Mad Men\\" may shock current PC culture sensibilities as relates to race and gender relations. At its core, \\"Mad Men\\" provides the viewer with a blistering and not too flattering look at ourselves and our entrenched culture of consumerism as strong today as it was nearly a half century ago. Jon Hamm leads an inspired cast of little known actors portraying reticent and mysterious Donald Draper, a highly sought after ad man and selling genius. Elisabeth Moss gets second billing as Peggy Olsen, Draper's wide-eyed new secretary. Moss's acting resume includes a stint as young Zoey Bartlett, daughter of the President in \\"West Wing.\\"   As for Hamm, he would make a convincing James Bond and depending upon the camera angle, ever present obscuring cigarette smoke and dim lighting proffered in any given scene, his tall, dark and handsome masculinity contains uncanny elements that are at times mildly suggestive of a young Timothy Dalton, Robert Di Niro, even Kevin Kline. Madison Avenue is reknowned for cynically packaging products or political personalities for retail sale but the consumer's ultimate acceptance is an exercise in free will that is heavily influenced by the cunning efforts of men like Draper. Whether Draper is signed on to promote cigarettes, aerosol deodorant, an upscale department store, presidential candidate or even promoting the state of Israel, he brings a cold and calculating hard edgedview of the world to the table. It may be true that the incessant cigarette smoking and hard drinking during regular business hours by almost all of the brilliantly defined characters in \\"Mad Men\\" is no longer de rigueur, the compulsion towards self-destruction has not changed one whit. No one defines that trait better than gifted actor John Slattery who plays Draper's boss, Roger Sterling. As a partner in the adveristing agency, Sterling is at once a likeable fellow and yet morally repugnant. Slattery pulls off the character effortlessly. The secondary male characters in \\"Mad Men\\" are well acquainted with feelings of ennui. Many in Drapers's staff for the most part married yet openly pursue self-gratifying liaisons with willing female co-workers with feminine agendas of their own. Some things have not changed one whit in all these years, even as the unadjusted price for a gallon of gas was around 30 cents in 1960 and tops $4.00 a gallon today.  The prices for virtually all commodities may have changed over the years but rest assured, people and their inate capacity to be gulled has not. You'd think we'd know better by now. That is the essential genius and overarching message contained within \\"Mad Men.\\" The successful ad man accepts as an article of faith that the pitch and ultimate message should always contain or vaguely suggest a measure of happiness or bliss associated with the product whether that product be packaged in pill form, a breakfast cereal, an enhancement to health or desirabilty, the only goal is to convince the consumer to open up the pocketbook and buy into the come hither promise of \\"new and different.\\"  Simply put, \\"Mad Men\\" is brilliantly crafted TV that unabashedly drives that message home.

0312427999|1.0|Even a weak ideology as Marxist Collectivism Doesn't Deserve Such a Weak Defender as Klein.    This book is filled with Economic fallacies and sophisms. All the old and dated Marxist ideological nonsense is presented here woven as a web of \\"facts\\" that presents the \\"evils\\" of liberal capitalism as something that it's not. Milton Friedman was a strong critic of government and how its influence on the market distorted the way people interact with each other in a voluntary manner. The Big Corporation evils are all tied to big government and the way both organizations collude to further the gains of their individual member, at the expense of every other individual. The author is obviously misleading her headers into thinking that the free market is some scheme of the economic elite to further their control over the masses. The author way of think is indoctrinating thousands of her readers in a newly packaged form of Marxism. Selling blatant lies as facts and rearranging those facts in a way that presents lassies faire Capitalism as a tool of the Robber Barons.    Klein's Utopia is Soviet Russia, Cuba and North Korea. And Milton Friedman's contribution to social policies has resulted in millions of individuals being pulled out of misery in countries like China and India. Each time the Chinese injects some freedom on their society, millions of lives improve. Marxism just cant clain that.    The evil aspect of Klein's claims is that this way of thinking is forwarding the rise of Populism in Latin America. The New American Marxists indoctrinated by people like Klein are not only impoverishing the U.S. with the evils of the \\"welfare\\" state but are also pushing for more leftist and collectivist policies to be enacted in the poor countries of Latin America. Supporting dictators like Castro and Chaves. Narco criminals like the FARC in Colombia and the rotten, corrupt and extremely inefficient governments of Brazil and Argentina. Marxism and Socialism has done an astonishing amount of destruction and evil in the world, it amazes me that it can still be sold as something new and liberating. It's plain Orwellian doublethink: Slavery is Freedom, as long the masters are socialist politicians and its army of bureaucratic drones.    The Irony is of course seeing these evil people selling their lies on Amazon. Amazon is a wonder of the free market. It is responsible for making available to tens of thousands of people products and books, people all over the world. This beautiful system of cooperation that is lassies' faire capitalism allows such complex synergetic organizations to emerge. Klein and her followers hate it, but they don't mind earning a little money off of it. After all they have to pay their bills: The bourgeois Communist Defense.    Klein is a Syncopant Of Marxist Paternalism, Save Yourself Some Time and Money. Go learn from REAL intellectuals: Like Milton Friedman, Thomas Sowell, von Mises, Hayek and Ayn Rand or classic authors like Tocqueville, John Stuart Mills, Henry David Thoreau and any other champions of freedom.

Great entertainment, love the smart remarks and jabs.

6304084145|3.0|I saw the 1968 version of Mayerling in April of 1969 at a base theater  while I was in basic training in the Air Force.  I note this because the  subject of the film and its well-dressed actors and its European scenery  were so different from the military surroundings and military \\"dress\\"   which I was enduring at the time.  I had not heard about the story of  Prince Rudolph and Princess Maria before. But suspected Mayerling's tragic ending from the start, but I think it did take the film a long time to reach its conclusion. However, I believe Mayerling was a visual delight and the musical score was beautiful too.  The cast was excellent with Omar Sharif and Catherine Deneuve along with  Ava Gardner and James Mason.  To many the story of these tragic lovers  seemed unbelievable and some criticized the dresses the women wore as too  1960's in style.  I did not notice this.    I have n't seen Mayerling in over thirty years and I think I will buy my  own DVD and see it again. Seeing this film again will remind me of what  I was doing when I first saw it, as I think many films and popular music  do for many people.
B000063DI9|5.0|At first, in the early 90s upon first listen around 13-14 years old, I sort of passed this album off as good but didn't listen much.      Then, back in the early 2000s, I dowloaded again.    As a musician, suddenly this album was a different experience at 23 than 13.   I never understood the ties the songs had, the clever underlying synth work.     This is one of the all-time great metal albums for the mature listener.    Some have been referencing pop music, and yes there are some hooks here and poppy sounds, but it's metal.  Pop-metal, sure in places, but this IS heavy metal through and through.    The Clairvoyant, Infinite Dreams, and 7th Son are 3 of the 10 best maiden songs ever.     Buy this album, steal it if you must if you are into progressive, yet poppy metal that has highly skilled musicians performing at the peak of their careers.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I already had the German release of the series, but that was without any extras. So I gave that set to my niece and ordered the US release. It was definitely worth it for the beautifl packaging, the commentaries and other extras. I was surprised that there are no subtitles, though. There's a sign for close-captioning on the box, but that doesn't work in Europe ... but the dialogue is really easy to understand, so it's not an issue.
0525950079|3.0|Just finally finished the Kindle version.  Enjoyable but it was a bit repetitive in some areas.  Not to give away any elements of the plot but it seemed that a couple of the plot lines would get somewhat resolved, the story would move on to something new and then return to the same former thing.  Nothing new the second go-around, just more of the same drama.  Weird.      The characters are compelling and believable although in a few areas I thought Follett interjected 21st Century values into his story in an attempt to make the characters more heroic.
B0000640VO|5.0|I really enjoyed and continue to enjoy this movie.  It a same that American movies can't seem to be able to tell a story without a whole lot of sex or nudity.  This has very little and its not the whole premise of the movie. I find that this movie is like the older American movies where the longing and searching are sexier than the actual act of sex.  I am not going to go into detail about the movie because I feel you have to see it to enjoy it.  Take a chance and watch this great movie.
0316067601|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me before I left on a recent vacation.  He said it had meant so much to him that he planned to buy 20 copies to give to friends.  I bought it and read it in 3 days.  I'm very thankful for Marcus and his companions.  I'm also thankful for all of our SEALs and those who train them. This book inspired me, not just as a person, but as an American.  I'd recommend this story to all Americans.

Great for little ones who might now had enough tactile stimulation. If you send with your care package, expect not to get it back, if you don't know that other children will get use out of this toy.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Seemingly I must apologize for liking this movie. Everyone I went to see it with got sick, hated the camera work and etc. I, however, did not get sick. I was  on the edge of my seat for this film. The helicopter crash has to be one of the most invigoratingly exciting things to watch in a theatre, it made me feel like my young life was soon coming to an abrupt end. Being a film student myself, I oft enjoy the guerrilla style of film making and am impressed when it is done well. This movie does it well, without once destroying the fragile world in which it is created. Not only does it excite the viewer, it makes one laugh. And purposefully. Pick it up on DVD, you won't get sick as it isn't in the huge ratio that it was in theatres.
B000YABYLA|3.0|God help us! Has the quirky, independent film finally reached it's undoing? Has it's own conventions now made it conventional? Seems like all you have to do today is: take a pretty, precocious girl; put her in flannel and Chuck Taylors; give her a guitar so she can compose her own soundtrack; surround her with your now cliched, socially awkward/emotionally retarded boyfriend; socially awkward/emotionally stable parents; socially adept/emotionally retarded yuppies; put a living room in the front yard...oh, and don't forget the quirky, organic animation to \\"tie\\" it all together. Napoleon Dynamite what hast thou wrought?    To be fair, there are some truly sparkling moments from the actors and the plot, once it gets going. But you can't help getting the impression that the director never really trusted the true quirkiness of the script, or his cast. The whole thing comes off like the final project of a How to Make Indy Films class. Whatever grit it was supposed to have has been polished to a high buff. What we get now is film craft by Butterick.    If this is what down and dirty independence has come to, what's really depressing is wondering where do we go from here?

B000BCE918|4.0|Jurassic Park was a great movie that still fill me with awe today. Those in the movie industry could learn a lot from just looking back to the first movie and seeing that CG is good, but sometimes a model or an animatronic works better if you want it to look real.<br /><br />ANYWAY, with this DVD set, I was pleased to see if had a cool center-opening box that's meant to be like the gate in the movie. The box seems very sturdy, but I have my reservations about it since I'm not so sure the gates will hold up over a long period of time (hence the 4/5). The inside is a typical tri-folding cardboard setup, with one DVD per section.<br /><br />Not a bad deal for 1 great movie, and 2 that were ok/sub-par...
B000X1Z0BU|1.0|I know the majority of people that have previously reviewed this picture have given it stellar marks. I'm sorry folks, I tried and I just couldn't get through it. Maybe it's my fault and a \\"male thing\\" but I'm more than willing to cop to that. Let's face it... I'm not that deep and I must not be in touch with my feminine side.<br /><br />The music started off pleasant enough in Once and eventually it wore me down along with the slow pace of the film. I always give a flick at least a half an hour and I barely made it with this one. The music just hurt the film and my ability to stick with it.<br /><br />The other thing is that it is purely a \\"chick flick\\". My wife and daughter doted on every word and nuance. If you're female and want a love story, this may be for you. If you're a guy, let her watch it alone.<br /><br /> Bottom line: This is not a movie for guys who like guy's films. You pray for action, laughs and intrigue... you get none. \\"Once\\" is a more than appropriate title when it comes to this viewer... never again.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Firefly is a great scifi series that sadly only lasted one season. The thing that really makes this show is the great characterization that Joss Weadon seems to put into everything he works on--from TV to comics.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed this series. The DVDs, cases, and box are standard. They get the job done, and are what I'd expect for any DVDs, really. The thing that gets me is the enormous load times I have on the menus. It might just be my DVD player, but it will load the background and do some animations, stop for a second, then load some foreground animation of the actual episode, and then load the menu's text. It's not a huge issue, but it's kind of annoying to have to wait.<br /><br />I also would have liked an option to 'Play All'. But that's very minor.<br /><br />Over all, this is a great set to buy. Especially for the sale price of $16.99. Get it while you can!

0743455967|3.0|I'm not a reader of Stephen King's fiction, nor am I fiction writer, but this book is a fine gem that will provide an afternoon of lively entertainment to those who love to read as well as those who love to write.  I bought the book on an online recommendation.  Though I've not read his novels, I have admired his consistent, reliable, disciplined creativity.  For those who wonder how writer can be consistent, reliable, and disciplined through a long and productive career, this book provides great insights.  His secret, I begin to see, is his approach to writing both as a craft and as a trade.  This book offers insights into both.<br /><br />I was surprised and delighted by how personal the book is.  In his book, King is generous in sharing the experiences that contributed to his becoming a writer and how these experiences shaped his approach to the trade.  Without going into great descriptive detail (this is done thoroughly in other reviews here), I can assure you that the first half of the book, which describes King's early life and his first successes as a writer, is wonderful.  This is very personal material and I suppose it must be in order to communicate the essential character of the writer himself.<br /><br />Among other wonderful insights were the revelations of his early jobs - scut work really - supporting his growing family and trying to perfect his writing.  I enjoyed his description of working in a professional laundry by day and writing in a cramped closet by night.  I also appreciated hearing about his family life during this period: this really helps put in perspective the pressure to succeed and the kind reassurance of his wife (who is also a writer).  This is sound and very personal advice for anyone starting out in any chosen profession, including writers.<br /><br />Perhaps not surprising to King's avid readers, the book is tremendously funny.  It should come as no surprise to anyone that the book is also entertaining.  Yet the humor and entertainment colors a superb description of writing as a profession.  Herein are both tricks of the trade and a workman's shop-talk.  This is essential material for all writers.  However, it's also fantastic material for those non-writers who are interested in how novel are made.<br /><br />Other reviews here contain details of the practical advice King gives on writing so I won't go into this except to say that it seems useful.  I will say, however, that it is rare to see a writer of King's professional stature approach the task of writing about writing with humility and common sense.  The resulting modest tone is perhaps the most impressive and wonderful aspect of this book.  I appreciated his reluctance to wax artistic or pedantic.<br /><br />Among its other practical aspects, one I appreciated, was his willingness to talk about the writing of other writers.  This, I learned, grows from his belief that any professional writer must always be reading the writings of others and learning from them.  In this book we see King's critical evaluation of what works and what does not work in the writing of others.  He also generously provides a list of the novels that he read during the course of his writing.<br /><br />This book is a good addition to the shelf in your library that contains style guides, dictionaries, thesaurus, and other recommendations on writing.  It is also a fine addition to the shelf that contains memoirs.  Surprisingly, it's also a good beach book.description of writing as a profession.

B00005JPNZ|2.0|I've enjoyed the first three Indiana Jones.  Sure some fans feel the second was a bit weak, others feel the third was the weaker.  And everyone felt that the first one was a classic. But for sure most everyone will agree that this fourth installment is awful - although the opening 5 minutes seemed promising.    Clearly this movie has the paws of George Lucas all over it, in an effort to establish a franchise with the Indiana Jones' son taking over and before it becomes Indiana Jones and the search for Geritol.    Also another sign of George Lucas's interference is in the indiscriminate overuse of special effects.  I guess his effects company, Industrial Light and Magic needed some more work.    As far as I am concerned the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with Harrison Ford et al. riding off into the sunset is a fitting end to the series.  Definately won't be buying this episode to \\"complete\\" my set.    This movie is utter  cash grabbing garbage.
B000BPG2JC|5.0|I previously read great reviews about Craig Johnson's first Walt Longmire, The Cold Dish.  I liked it okay, it reminded me of William Kent Krueger's series which is one of my favorites.  So I bought Death Without Company and Kindness Goes Unpunished and fell in love with the series.  Had to rush out and buy Another Man's Moccasins.  He starts off with great characters and just keep adding through the series.  The books are first rate mysteries, but what kept me coming back for more was Walt and his family, friends (especially Henry Standing Bear) and staff.  They often shake their heads at his oftentimes lack of understanding in relationships and technology, but as the series progresses you come to realize just how much he's loved and respected in the community.  Can't wait for the 5th Walt Longmire.
B0013J30W2|4.0|2008's \\"Wanted\\" defies easy characterization; it is equal parts sci-fi flick, Hong Kong action movie, and revenge thriller.  It borrows heavily from the stylish violence of \\"The Matrix\\" and the mysticism of, say, \\"The Order,\\" and keeps you guessing right down to the last scene.<br /><br />As the movie opens, a loser Chicago accountant named Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy in a stunning change of pace from \\"Atonement\\" and \\"Becoming Jane\\") gets stepped on by everyone in his life, from his nasty boss to his cheating girlfriend and exploitative best buddy.  In a drug store to buy his anxiety medicine, Wesley is saved from a mysterious assassin by a woman of unusual talents named Fox (Angela Jolie in steely-eyed mode).  The ensuing chase sequence will leave the viewer breathless and introduce Wesley to The Fraternity, whose members kill that others may live.  The Fraternity is directed by the elderly Sloane (Morgan Freeman in wiseman mode) whose privilege it is to read the names of targets out of flaws in woven cloth (just go with it). Wesley is invited to join The Fraternity.  After a joyous day burning personal bridges, Wesley takes Sloane up on his offer.<br /><br />Initiation into The Fraternity involves some incredibly vicious and seemingly impossible training, much of it designed to make Wesley realize his identity and understand his motivation.  Wesley discovers he can manipulate his own andrenaline levels, allowing him to do things in ways unknown to ordinary mortals.  He learns that The Fraternity is under siege from a rogue assassin named Cross.  Finally, he is told that Cross is the killer of his own long-missing father.<br /><br />Wesley progresses rapidly from training to his first missions to the big job, going after Cross in a monastery in Eastern Europe.  The job doesn't turn out quite the way Wesley expects, setting the scene for a series of unsettling betrayals and thrilling confrontations right down to a conclusion back in Wesley's old office.<br /><br />\\"Wanted\\" is pure escapism; viewers are advised to sit back and enjoy the ride.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|I am not a history buff.  As a matter of fact, I hated history in school.  I didn't like to memorize names and dates etc.  This movie has put a real human side to the history of our country.  Many teenagers today do not know our U.S. history.  I am 42 and want to know more of the personal and human side of our countries history.  This mini series shows you that side of the founders of our country.  This is one depiction of our history at that time.  Not everyone will share my opinion.  But, it is a VERY good series that everyone should watch and learn more about the great country they call home. I am recommending this show to my family and friends.  This is how I've been celebrating my countries independence and birthday.  It has been enjoyable. Watch the show.  I don't think you will be disappointed.

After watching &quot;Evil under the Sun&quot; (1982) and &quot;Appointment with Death&quot; (1988) you naturally think of Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot.  The whole movie is packed with great actors, yet even thought you recognize them they do not distract from the characters that they play.<br /><br />I thought that it was a nice touch when the kids along the shore mooned Mrs. Van Schuyler (Bette Davis) as kids would do everywhere.<br /><br />Simon (Simon MacCorkindale) and his new bride Linnet (Lois Chiles) are being perused by Jacqueline De Bellefort (Mia Farrow) the girl he jilted.

At least he admits one of his goals is to tear down the individualism this country is founded upon by replacing systems of rewards and punishment, and the goal of responsibility with navel gazing anarchy.  Newsflash, author, we already have a society based on no parenting parenting, I shudder to envision a world of his making that is even more so.
B0000E5NPZ|5.0|****1/2 1958. this film was based on Françoise Sagan bestseller [[ASIN:0061440795 Bonjour Tristesse: A Novel (P.S.)]] and was produced and directed by Otto Preminger. A wealthy playboy and his seventeen years old daughter C&eacute;cile live an insouciant life. They are spending the summer on the French Riviera when one of Raymond's old friend Anne comes to their house near the sea. C&eacute;cile imagines a scheme to get rid of the intruder when Raymond decides to marry Anne. Preminger chose two actors who already worked for him, David [[ASIN:B000APCIYQ The Moon Is Blue [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - France ]]] Niven and Jean [[ASIN:B000AMCCLS Saint Joan [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - France ]]] Seberg in order to give life to Sagan's characters. And they are superb in these roles. With the sublime Deborah Kerr as Anne the intruder, our pleasure is complete. Also note the titles by Saul Bass, the song BONJOUR TRISTESSE sung by the French icon Juliette Gr&eacute;co and the smart idea to film the flashbacks in color and the present in black & white. Highly recommended.

Another same type of release would just have be the same thing again. there is a lot of energy here!! Theres a lot of screaming guitars then theres slow music then bam it starts rocking again. Both of the cds are the same to me one is not better than the other also I would like to say that im not sick of or board of the cd even after about 25 times listening to it. Im actual singing it to myself! Some of the other reviews seem like there talking about some other cd!!
0752888226|5.0|I believe I've covered this subject before, but I feel that it is appropriate when it comes to the latest James Rollins thriller.     There are people who believe that the world will not end with a bang - as in global war, but with a whimper - a plague unlike anything humanity has ever seen. A plague that will make the Black Plague which decimated Europe so many centuries ago look like the common cold.     That's the premise for the novel. A disease of such potency that it could conceivably spell the end of the human race, a disease that is as old as the planet itself and hasn't been seen since Marco Polo's great exploration.     As per usual, my disclaimer... There will be no spoilers in this review to ruin the book for any would-be readers. Everything I talk about can be found on the back of the cover or the inside cover of the novel.    The men and women of Sigma force once again find themselves at odds with the Guild in Judas Strain... but this time around the fate of humanity lies in the hands of the victors.     It all starts with a rash of unexplained marine animal deaths around Christmas Island. Sigma sends in a small team to work along side the WHO in order to determine what has happened. As fate would have it a massive cruise ship just happens to be in the vicinity of the island, and its services are put to good use to help those who have become infected with a wide variety of illnesses.    Things quickly go sour when a band of pirates attack the island and take over the ship. Of course the attack is lead by a high ranking member of the Guild, and the team members of Sigma are put to use in trying to figure out a cause and possible cure for this deadly `Judas Strain' that has been discovered.    Now, I've been a fan of James Rollins writing for close to a decade. I've read every single book he's written since I picked up his first thriller Subterranean many years ago. For me, the main reason I've enjoyed his work is the science fiction aspect that has appeared in every novel he's written.    That's why his work is up there with my other favourite authors, Preston and Child. I found a number of similarities between their work, and it has always kept me guessing, and I've been pleasantly surprised when I finally read the outcome in each book.    This particular offering was, in my opinion, one of Jim's best offerings. The action was almost non stop, and even though there have always been great threats to the world and mortal danger to the characters he created, I'd have to say that this time around Sigma faced their most difficult task to date.     Because, not only were the lives of the Sigma members in jeopardy, but as I stated before, the entire world.     And to make matters worse, the Guild upped the ante and made things personal.     Also, on top of the action and suspense, Jim threw a number of surprises into the mix, things that, as usual, I wasn't expecting, as well as the return of an old adversary, one who had all the earmarks of a classic `Dragon Lady'.     If you don't get the meaning, look it up on the net. If you're a fan of James Rollins work, then you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.     The science in the novel seemed quite sound as well, although when I asked two close personal friends who are both doctors at the university of Calgary and deal with viruses and the like, they were at a loss. They had never heard of a `Judas Strain' before, and after I explained the concept to them, understood it but never heard of a name for it like that.    Still, after talking to them about the novel, they were intrigued enough to pick it up and give it a go.     I'll also say this - it was hard to put down! It only took me about five days to read the book from cover to cover. My wife was quite angry at me a couple of nights when we went to bed and I kept the lights on until nearly midnight so that I could read while she tried to sleep.     If she was a reader, she'd understand. I digress...    One final note- the novel had closure. There have been many times in the past where I've read books that left sub-plots unresolved, or where the novel just ended abruptly. That's not the case with this book. All sub-plots were tied up nice and neatly and the fates of various characters were dealt with.     So, it was the perfect end to a great novel.    5 out of 5
B000JVT09C|1.0|I have to say first, I'm not a comic book fan. I've never read, nor will I ever read any sort of comic book. I am, however, a movie fan. I loved the first two Chris Reeve Superman Movies, (3 and 4 were just dreadful) and I was hoping that with this reincarnation it would bring back the awesomeness of the first two. It seems that with Superman Returns for whatever reason it decided to become a sequel, but not a proper sequel, just a sequel where they change things that happened in the past which we know didn't happen because we watched the first four movies. (The last two, yes unfortunately)<br /><br />I'm going to touch on quite a few things that I noticed in this movie where I raised one eyebrow and thought, WTF? The first one is the main one that I think most people will have noticed and genuinely asked the question. What were they thinking? OK, Superman had left Metropolis to find the remains of his home planet which had apparently been discovered by astronomers. This was something that had happened after Superman 4, and now he returns to jump back into the job he abandoned and make friends with the bitter Lois Lane. This is what annoyed me. Lois Lane, for whatever reason had suddenly forgotten that Clark Kent was Superman? Forgive me if I'm wrong here but didn't she find out his real identity in the first Superman Movie? I know this film wasn't billed as an actual sequel, but if you're going to name a movie Superman Returns, and it's released 28 years after the original Superman movie then you have to at least keep it consistent because you have a lot of people at least expecting a bit of a sequel feel to it.<br /><br />The other thing I wanted to poke at was something another reviewer has also mentioned. This is a comic book movie, correct? This is a movie based on a man from another planet who's pretty much invincible, correct? Then why is it that with this sequel they had the beauty of CGI and the ability to bring a crazy villain (rather than Luthor) to go against Superman. Why don't we get some real comic book action in this film? Spiderman did it, The Incredible Hulk has done it, hell even the Dark Knight has done it. So why did Superman not bother? Why did Singer, Harris & Dougherty decide to give us a soap operatic movie that simply, Superman fans weren't after. Sure the Lois reunion would have been cool and to see her moved on would have been interesting, but this was the whole damn movie. Superman returns to Earth to find that a bitter Lois had written a Pulitzer prize winning article on \\"Why the Earth doesn't need Superman.\\" Lois has moved on and she's now in a new relationship with the unlikeable Richard played by James Marsden and has a child to him. Sure a new relationship storyline is fun and all but this consumed the entire movie and the Lex Luthor's insane plot was overshadowed by that.<br /><br />That's not the icing on the cake, you're going to love this ridiculousness. The kid, while on a boat being kidnapped by Luthor, along with Lois by the way. Lois is being approached by one of the henchmen who's ready to beat the crap out of her, then BAM!!! out of nowhere a piano flies into the face of the henchman. So the child is the child of Superman, remember Lois can't remember who Superman really is, she's forgotten. Nothings confirmed though, you see it could have been just one of those crazy feats of strength that you hear people have on the news.<br /><br />I've got nothing else to say, apart from this is THE worst superhero movie EVER. I know that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but I can assure you I'm not. This is even worse than the Batman & Robin movie from 1997 because at least that had more fighting and action. In Superman Returns we were presented with about three major action scenes and they were literally no longer than 5 minutes. Brandon Routh can make a good Superman and Spacey a good Luthor. Bosworth needs to be dropped as she's just terrible as Lois Lane. I'm only hoping that in the sequel entitled Man of Steel (the DC movies are creating a theme with comic book movies now, just look at The Dark Knight, sequel to Batman Begins) the cast have another bout of amnesia and the child and the poor relationship are forgotten about and we can be given a real comic book movie from the new Superman. I would like to see an intergalactic villain in the sequel, maybe Metallo or Doomsday?<br /><br />Terrible movie, stay away.ies are creating a theme with comic book movies now, just look at The Dark Knight, sequel to Batman Begins) the cast have another bout of amnesia and the child and the poor relationship are forgotten about and we can be given a real comic book movie from the new Superman.

B0013L2EDQ|5.0|I believe I've covered this subject before, but I feel that it is appropriate when it comes to the latest James Rollins thriller.     There are people who believe that the world will not end with a bang - as in global war, but with a whimper - a plague unlike anything humanity has ever seen. A plague that will make the Black Plague which decimated Europe so many centuries ago look like the common cold.     That's the premise for the novel.

0757307272|5.0|I know the book says for TEENS, but why wait????<br />My granddaughter's birthday is in July. Facing 10 and the next grade and struggling somewhat through the end of the last semester, I wanted her to have a view of the 'big picture' that she would be ready to take on the challenge of the critical years to come.<br /><br />This book is about empowerment. Helping a child form their own opinions and allowing them to mature without encumbering them with mixed messages during a difficult time.<br />I have only been working with her a month, but she now understands WHY she WANTS a clean room. She has already developed some of her OWN goals and is even forming ideas about what she would like to be when she grows up.<br /><br />Since the book is written by peers, it gives kids tools and examples in their own language.<br />She has come to understand that class projects are not something to be done casually, but with consideration and forethought.<br /><br />Even MORE important is the sense of SELF she is discovering and, as an amazing side benefit, HAPPINESS.<br />Maybe they should have called this Stop the Mope, Learn to Cope.... I DID read the book WITH her to help her feel more empowered and teamed up with an ally.<br />I also figured this would be the best way to PREPARE ME for the changes she would get from this book.<br /><br />Ready for a re-birth? Make this book a family event and grow together.<br />Update, May 2013:  My granddaughter is now almost 15, an honor student and exceptionally bright.  Was it this book?  I am so proud and impressed by her.  Model student, taking College prep even after what I would consider grueling honors classes in Jr High:  High school, she pushes herself further but she also plays as hard as she works.  Its like planting a garden and seeing the fruit of that garden!  WOW....

B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been listening to rock of various stripes since my teens in the mid-60's.  While I still get a kick out of the classics, my greatest thrill (musically speaking) is finding a fresh twist on rock traditions...a sound that doesn't simply re-tread old ground or wander off into experimentation for its own sake.     American Idiot is, in many ways, an old fashioned album, with strong echos of The Who, Pink Floyd and other great stadium bands of the last half century.  But Green Day rejuvenates the form with inventive rhythms, unexpected melodic changes and a 21st Century political and social sensibility, making American Idiot a completely contemporary piece of musical art. If you're looking for an example of the best of today's mainstream rock and roll, you could hardly do better.  Give the album a listen; start to finish, it's a blast!
B0010X745K|1.0|This was the WORST movie I have EVER seen. I kept watching it thinking it would get better if I was just patient. It did not. The ending was miserable and a perfect fit to a wasted movie experience. Save yourself the time and money and rent/buy a movie that is worth it.
0143038419|4.0|I am surprised at the negative comments on this book.  I don't know what those reviewers were expecting, but I found the book to be a light chronicle of one woman's journey in search of herself and a sane relationship with life.  Gilbert writes with an  open-hearted honesty.  At times her style and commentary seem a bit child-like, or even childish, but overall I have found her telling of the tale to be engaging and sweet-spirited.  I'm just past the   point where she decides to stay a while longer at the Ashram in India.  Her personal search for enlightenment bogs down a bit at this point, but I appreciate her effort to lead others through the labyrinth she explored.  Maybe those who react so negatively have yet to appreciate the value of that kind of exploration.  I can see how it might have struck me that way some years back.

B0017APPSE|5.0|I avoided this movie when it was playing in theaters, since the reviews from established critics portrayed it as an empty, boring waste of film. I rented it from our local video store only because it was one of the few blu-ray titles still on the shelf, and because I wanted to see the great costume and set designs in hi-def. In fact, I was mesmerised by this movie from first frame to last. Everything about it--plot, character development, cinematography and music--was top-drawer. Easily, I would have nominated this film as a top contender for Best Film of the Year.    Particularly noteworthy were the characters, in both a lead and supporting role. Although a movie's limited time space cannot create well-rounded development, each of these characters came across as strong and unique; clearly each had his or her agenda, mixing fear, betrayal, rage and ambition as they interacted with one another and the circumstances they found themeselves in. Of course, this could not have been possible without great acting and plot development, and so credit has to be given to the writing and casting crew. In the fifty years that I've been studying film seriously, I can't remember the last movie that had such strong characterization.    So why is my review so much higher than most others? Honestly, I think it's because today's movie audience wouldn't know a good film if it bit them where the sun doesn't shine. Our society pushes people to go faster and faster to go exactly nowhere. We want action to blast our senses five seconds after we sit in our seat, and as such have no patience to allow quality movies to develop. You may note that the movie industry no longer makes classic films such as 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'Doctor Zhivago' or 'Ben-Hur'.    If you're one of those rare individuals who appreciates great drama, this is the movie for you. On the other hand, if you have the attention span of a house fly, with half the intellect, you might be better off drooling over '30 Days of Night'.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|The idea behind the film is clever, even if it is a bit obvious -- to the point where it's surprising nobody has done anything quite like it, or at least nothing on a similar scale. Somebody thought, let's make a monster mayhem flick but instead of a blockbuster make it an indie, shot amateur style: Godzilla meets the Blair Witch. That allows them to economize on the special effects, using sparing effects that would work on tv but not on the big screen -- but when shot on a consumer video camera by a guy who can barely keep it aimed long enough to get a clear picture who can tell the difference?<br /><br />As far as that premise goes, the film kind of works. It keeps you on the edge of your couch, it moves at a fast pace with a healthy balance between emotional drama and massive monster mayhem.<br /><br />The shoddy camera work does detract from the experience of watching it. I wish the filmmakers had come up with some reason to put the camera in the hands of a slightly more competent videographer. I understand that without hand held camera work this would be a different film -- and probably not novel enough to fly -- but I wish that they'd gone more in the direction of independent film handheld work (as in, say, the Dogme 95 films of Lars von Trier or Thomas Vinterberg or Harmony Korine) rather than the direction of \\"totally clueless guy who for some reason never lets go of the camera but doesn't make much of an effort to point it in coherent ways.\\"<br /><br />The emotional drama of the film centers around a bunch of good looking 20 somethings who have all gathered to say farewell to a buddy who is going to Japan. It turns out he just slept with his gorgeous best friend and then, because he didn't know how to deal with their relationship before he left, decided not to call her again, but is extremely upset when she shows up to his party on the arm of another guy. His need to rush into extreme danger to save her didn't have the emotional pull for me that, say, the much better Korean monster flick The Host delivered in a family that pulls together to save their missing child. The problem here is that there isn't enough to show that the characters we are supposed to be rooting for are really all that likeable.<br /><br />In spite of all this, I had a good time watching the film. I do think that the \\"do it yourself\\" aesthetic of this film is intriguing and reveals a lot of possibilities that this film didn't exhaust. Worth a watch -- by no means a classic.uch better Korean monster flick The Host delivered in a family that pulls together to save their missing child.

This book has Sophie Kinsella's writing style, just like the \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic.\\" It has the same type of humor and cute story with new charcters.<br />This is a cute, chic-brit-lit book with the usual ending and a few surprises.

0689865384|5.0|I picked this up after reading recommendations by other SF authors, like Cory Doctorow. I'm way out of the target demographic for this book (being a middle-aged man) and, I'll have to admit, it's something I might be a little embarrassed reading in public due to the cover and obvious target audience, but I'd still heartily recommend it (and the rest of the series) to just about anyone of any age or sex. The book's cover and blurbs kinda hide the fact that this is pure, good SF - lots of action, intriguing moral dilemmas, with interesting cultural insights and satire.    I described it to my wife as an update to Logan's Run, where people live in isolated cities where their every needs are taken care of (not domed, but quite insular nonetheless). Instead of being terminated at the age of 30, like in Logan's Run, you are turned into Paris Hilton at the age of sixteen - made physically beautiful, but somehow turned into mindless party people. Like in Logan's Run, the protagonist, Tally, against her will, escapes the city right before being turned \\"Pretty\\" and discovers a whole world of dissidents and refugees who are fighting against the system, including old \\"Uglies\\" who live in the ruins of \\"Rusty\\" cities. The social issues are blatant and there are even metaphorical asides, such as the mutant orchids that have taken over much of the wild - smothering environmental diversity with their self-similar beauty. I admire the author, however, for never having a character say, \\"Oh, the orchids are like the Pretties\\" even though it is obvious, he never beats the reader over the head with the metaphor.    The later books move through the strata of these new societal levels, the \\"Pretties\\" and the \\"Specials\\" and you meet other isolated human societies, including a violent engineered \\"zoo\\" of \\"primative\\" humans. It would have been easy to portray all of these levels as simplistic social morality plays, but he keeps it all fairly realistic, or at least believable, with plenty of moral and ethical dilemmas that have no easy answers - is it correct to make choices for people who have been engineered to reject those choices? How much can you engineer the human psyche and still remain human? Each of us changes as we grow and mature, and we reject and alter our mindsets as we grow - does that make us different people? The \\"Pretty\\" cities have been existing in a productive, peaceful state with a level of environmental coexistence that the most radical \\"tree hugger\\" would love, for centuries, but at a severe loss of freedom of thought and under the control of those who think they know best for everyone. Is that OK? How much individual freedom can you abandon and still be free and human?    As I said, if you examine the cover and read the blurbs on the back, you would think that this is near future teen social novel, with plastic surgery enhanced teens vs. \\"normal\\" ugly teens, like the publisher is afraid that teen girls won't pick up a \\"real\\" SF book, but it's actually set centuries in the future with nano-technology, bioengineering, hoverboards, and a rebellious cyberpunk feel that should also appeal to boys and a wider SF audience. Of course, as sales results and critics have begun to point out, the teen/young adult market is very hot right now (led, in large part, by the Harry Potter phenomenon) and as many adults as teens are buying, reading, and enjoying these books. You should too.
B000N3ST8Y|5.0|After reading countless reviews of all the DM remasters, I, being the completist moron that I am, bought a copy of the original release and the remastered/extended version so I could have all the tracks.  I too was disappointed about the US bonus tracks not being on the actual CD of the remastered version (whatever to the comment that \\"that was what DM wanted\\"--if thats what they wanted, the US version would have been the same as the Brit version, DUH!)  Anyway, after thinking about this long and hard and glossing over my new remasters, I found a brilliant solution to my (and others) problem.  We all have computers, we all have music software, most of us have DVD players in our computers.  The DVD of the remaster carries both 5.1 and standard STEREO audio on it.  Why not simply import the CD into our iTunes/Real/Windows player, then import the stereo mix of the bonus tracks off the DVD into the same player, then burn a CD with all the tracks on it?  Am I a genius or what!  It does work and sounds as good as you tell the player to burn the disc.  Granted, it's not the original pressed CD, but it lets you get the \\"US\\" version remastered with all the tracks.  Just thought I'd throw this out there for anyone else who wants all the tracks on CD.    As far as the albums go, the remasters are phenomenal!
B000G73UEU|4.0|I first was introduced to Cohen a few years ago and loved his music.  Later when I saw \\"I'm Your Man\\" on Sundance I was completely enraptured by many of the performances on it.  I was happy to see a CD was made of the songs.    I will say my favorite is probably the amazing cover of Anthem by Perla Betalla and Julie Christensen, though this is very closely followed by Rufus' Chelsea Hotel #2 and Teddy Thompson's Tonight Will be Fine.  Another in the top list would be Antony's If it be your will.    Not quite as good but definitely worth it are Nick Cave doing Suzanne and then Sisters of Mercy by Beth Orton.    The other songs are not quite as memorable imo, but still great songs.    I was sorely dissapointed that both the Handsome Family's version of A Thousand Kisses Deep was missing as was the Wainright version of Hallelujah (One of the greatest covers of Hallelujah ever).      I can see why alot of people may not have liked this CD though if your a very old and hardcore Cohen fan.  No one really sounds like Cohen and if you like that deep base voice then there is no one that will really touch Cohen for singing his songs.  Personally, I think Cohen is a much better writer than singer and I prefer to hear other people sing most of his songs (with some exceptions, I think he sings Tower of Song, Suzanne, and A Thousand Kisses Deep well).    That being said, Cohen's writing is amazing.  He truly is one of the most gifted poets/songwriters still alive.

B00005JPD0|5.0|A strange film on a very trite and over-used theme. The dedication to New Orleans does not change that fact. After \\"Back to the Future\\" we cannot accept some of the rather sloppy elements we find in this film. A few examples. At the beginning, thanks to the machine to explore the past, we discover the car with the explosives on the boat did not have a number plate. How can security rules explain the fact that a car without a number plate was allowed on a boat transporting more than 500 people? The terrorist stole a car because he needed one. But he actually had one. So why did he use a stolen one? But the worst part is how the Doug from the future when arriving in the past does all kinds of antics, leaving all kinds of traces behind him in the past, obviously cutting short the plan of the terrorist, and yet the terrorist will fulfill his plan entirely in the first version of the attack, but in the first version still the investigation reveals the Doug from the future has already intervened in the past and hence should have changed the result of the terrorist attack by hijacking it off its normal course. If he was in the girl's apartment before the terrorist attack, leaving his finger prints and his blood everywhere, how could the terrorist succeed in killing the girl and blowing the boat up. And he the Doug from the future dies in the past, that would make him dead for the future. He could not come up alive and start everything like normal after the explosion. If the past is changed, then the future is changed too. If you die, you die and you do not exist any more. And the Doug who died in the explosion will not be able to arrest the terrorist who was killed just before the explosion, both being dead for the future. And if the girl managed to escape from the car when it fell into the Mississippi through a broken window, and she was not trained like a federal agent, how come Doug, a trained federal agent, could not follow suit and get out from the car through the same window? But we can suspend our disbelief and then consider the film as something that does not have to be logical. Pure action. Fine. What's the meaning of this action in 2006, five years after 9/11 and three years after the invasion  of Iraq, not to mention today in 2008? Terrorist attacks in the USA come from white Americans who define themselves as patriots and consider they have to attack the security forces and the people of the USA to make them realize they have to start a third world war to stop the world from changing and to prevent the USA from becoming a second rank nation, and do not forget the USA became the first nation in the world after and thanks to the second world war. And in this scenario, one little bomb can kill more than 500 people. They don't need four or five Boeings to do that. One man alone, properly trained can be a lot more effective than Al Qaeda. That's what you call economy of scales. The second idea is that in such cases the terrorist, when caught, will be buried by the FBI into silence and disappearance because the government will not want details to be given on two subjects. First of all the absolute incapability of the state to protect the territory and the people of the USA. Second the fact that they possess a technology that enables them to reconstruct everything that has happened in a particular place, behind walls, closed doors and any kind of protection. There is no privacy and no protection of privacy in this new hi-tech vision. That is a lot more frightening than a few berserk patriots who consider the death of a few thousand people to be a good thing to arouse consciousness. There, beyond believability, this film is a really scary movie. \\"Minority Report\\" was frightening but they only read the future, and in the end dropped the technology for political reason. Here it is a lot worse since they can read the past, what really happened. We are trapped 100%. We are under constant surveillance and control by people, forces andagencies we do not even know exist or will exist.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesagencies we do not even know exist or will exist.

B000UD08HW|5.0|As a former PINK FLOYD member , DAVID GILMOUR and this blu-ray are a superb , the quality of the sound and the performance of the PINK FLOYD songs,mainly ECHOES (but worst than the unbeatable original one),  are very good. The David Gilmour´s songs are a in a lower level but sometimes cointains good guitar solos. The image is in a lower level than the sound but you can make some adjusts and the image can get great too.  Nowadays is difficult to hear musics with this kind of quality.  I really reccomend it.
B000H7JD4A|5.0|Heavy Metal led a whole generation of young people to a more intense aural experience. Bands in their mid- twenties crafted the records that, in the 80´s, defined and developed the movement. Now, 30 years after, a few warriors survived band personnel and industry changes, and the grunge, rap-metal and emo eras. In the case of Iron Maiden, they even managed to stay true to their long-time fans while becoming mature persons and now can deliver a more message-conscious face of their music, without losing the energy that once overwhelmed those young audiences.    2006´s A Matter Of Life And Death is, overall, a darker, more reflective and epic record. The opening track, Different World is the only short, radio-oriented tune, but its sheer power recalls us of the early Maiden sound. These Colours Don't Run, Lord of Light and Brighter Than a Thousand Suns are marvelous, extended songs that have a critical message about war and humanity, and push a little bit the limits for what we have listened from this band. The Legacy is a rhapsodic track that opens with mysterious acoustic passages, For The Greater Good Of God is one track that, in my opinion, could make it to the regular IM set list for its catchy, anthem-like melodies, amazing riffs and guitar leads, sometimes it reminds me of 1995´s Sign Of The Cross. The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg is another standout, for its heavy, dark riffs and unforgettable chorus.      Bruce Dickinson´s voice is unique for how intact its range and timbre have remained through the years, the overall recording-mixing sound of the album and the musicians performance are outstanding.     Although AMOLAD continues to bring elements from the band's different eras, it still manages to bring a new color into the IM palette. After all, Iron Maiden is not a band that earned people's respect for reinventing itself on every record; they are a legend for simply been themselves through all these years.   4.5 stars
0807126063|1.0|I found myself not caring about the main character and I didn't find the musings very entertaining.
B000FP7MHO|4.0|A tale of teen (or rather pre-teen) love. In a very traditional school in England (where corporal punishment is still practiced), a boy and a girl (both about twelve) fall in love. Relatively realistic during most of its running time, during the final twenty minutes it falls into anarchist fantasy, as the children in the school thwart the attempts of the parents and the school masters to prevent their elopement and marriage. Unlike other people, I didn't watch this as a child: it's not filtered by childhood memories, so I think I can judge it better as a movie. It's a good romantic story, sometimes demagogic, sometimes overwrought in its criticisms of traditional England, but it's still irresistible. The actress playing the girl, the beautiful Tracy Hyde, is fantastic (unfortunately, and despite her obvious talents, she never became a major star) The screenplay was by Alan Parker (the director was the unknown Waris Hussein, who would never made a major movie again). There is a great soundtrack, mostly by the Bee Gees, but the best song is probably is \\"Teach the Children\\" by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. The fine color photography is sometimes reminiscent of a 70s commercial, but it also let you see the ravishing London of almost forty years ago (one of the best scenes have the young lovers skipping school and sightseeing around the English capital). A relative failure in England and the United States when released, this nevertheless became a huge hit in Latin America and the Far East (specially, Japan). Incredibly, this movie has been very seldom shown in television, and the DVD is unavailable in many countries (including the US).
B0000DJZ8R|1.0|I ordered this DVD from Amazon and received a defective copy.  There were small pockmarks on the outer edge of the DVD which prevented viewing some of the latter scenes of the movie.  I sent this DVD back and got a replacement with the same problem!  I sent that back and got a refund.  Beware, there appears to be a common manufacturing defect with this particular version of the movie.
141694740X|1.0|Don't ruin your life with this foolish book. First off, Greg Behrendt is a stand-up comic, not an expert. Second, his \\"research\\" consists of emailing questions to a handful of personal friends. Furthermore, he comes across as being a narcissist and clearly a very controlling personality. I suppose if a woman wants to attract a narcissist, a Scott Peterson-type sociopath, a controlling abuser, or an obsessed stalker, then this book will be a very handy tool.    Adult men who come on like gangbusters in beginning are either desperately needy or have extremely shallow emotions, and are most likely either narcissistic or sociopathic or at least controlling. Period. These men lack the depth of emotion necessary to feel real love - otherwise it would take them some time to let it grow. What \\"love\\" is to them is being instantly infatuated with a woman's appearance and suitability. That wears off in time and they drop you like a hot rock for the next infatuation. Be wary of the ones who are \\"really, really into you\\" right off the bat, and if they are extremely charming, doting and flatter you a lot, RUN! Think about Amber Frey.    Also, he never reveals the number one reason a man loses interest in a woman: she has sex with him too soon. It's a double standard, but it's the truth, so deal with it. No man truly appreciates an easy woman. If Behrendt had an ounce of sense he would have said on every page to wait at least a couple of months, and definitely once exclusivity is mutually agreed upon, before consummating a relationship. Instead he rants on and on about NEVER, EVER calling a guy. That is ridiculous. All the nice, normal guys I know have a three try rule: if she doesn't call you back after three tries, leave her alone because she isn't interested. Only the most dangerous of men will keep pursuing a woman who never calls him back.    There are so very many misleading notions in this book that I could go on for pages, but essentially Behrendt has everything upside-down and backward: he advises to make it darned near impossible for a man to even get your phone number, unless he behaves like a desperate stalker, but then once you go out with the guy, you can feel free to immediately have sex and expect him to call you daily and act like you're in an established relationship - all in the first few weeks! In reality, you should let a man you like have your phone number, but then make him court you and work hard to EARN your trust and affection over time as you get to know each other, let real love blossom, and BUILD UP to an established relationship before sex becomes part of it. Duh!    The best book in the world on the subject of relationships is \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\" by Sherry Argov. It is very well researched and is based on interviews with many hundreds of men and women from all walks of life. It is written with great wisdom and humor and will explain everything you need to know about men and dating, such as why men don't call (not necessarily a reason to dump them); why you must wait to have sex; what drives men away; how to rekindle a man's interest; etc. Most importantly, it teaches women how to get into, and stay in, the driver's seat at all times. It transformed my dating life overnight and I haven't had trouble understanding men since.    John Gray's Mars and Venus series is excellent, too.
0321544080|5.0|Short review here,since the others have given it a good summary.  This is half 'how I did it' photography book, and half 'conversation with a great photographer with some hidden nuggets'.  Great for photographers and those who are just interested in seeing some really excellent photos.
B0012Q732O|4.0|My wife and I picked up this movie this morning, popped it in the DVD player after dinner and just finished watching it.  Okay, it doesn't break cinematic new ground and is hardly a classic.  But, as semi-historical fantasy adventure flicks go, it was entertaining and worth the price and time in our opinion.  If you're just looking for a fun movie to watch with a decent storyline, lots of action (but relatively little blood or gore) and some great visuals, you could do a lot worse than \\"10,000 B.C.\\"
B00005JM0B|5.0|Nick Stahl's portrayal of John Connor in my opinion defined the character, and Claire Danes was also excellent in the movie as his soon-to-be wife. Of all the Terminator movies, i felt that this movie devoted more time to character development and story building than the prior films, which is good because the series has a philosophical component which a lot of people for some reason overlook. Although the movies are best known as action films, they are also the story of mankind's savior- a person who knows he is destined to be a great leader for his people but who doesn't want the role. Nick Stahl brings that story to life in this movie. It's a story which beyond being entertaining is also worthwhile because it has parallels throughout history. Most of the great leaders we remember in history rose to their roles in the midst of a crisis. The most noble minded of those leaders resented their role as a leader because they resented the crisis that propelled them into that role. This movie takes that story and brings it into a science fiction format, along with bringing a message that people should be careful how much trust they place in technology as we move into a digital age where more and more of our lives revolve around computers. That message along with John Connor's storyline make this movie very compelling. I don't understand why Terminator 4 is said to have cast a different actor in the leading role. Nobody deserves the role better than Nick Stahl.
B00011CZRE|4.0|The seven deadly sins exemplified in this serial killer genre flick with a young Brad Pitt and the usual creepy performance by Kevin Spacey as the killer. Black and white cop buddy movies are a dime a dozen, but this one is saved by a decent script and good acting. The end is a gross out, but at least we are spared actually seeing it.
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|Out of all the sci-fi action/adventure movies I've seen in the past year, Jumper was definitely the best. From the documentary parts of the DVD it seems they are considering sequels and I hope they do make sequels because this movie has a great storyline that's worth continuing. It would be great to see the saga continue. I happen to really like sci-fi and superhero type movies, and normally the ones I like come from comic strips. This one was based on a book which I haven't personally read, but according to the documentary, the movie is nothing like the book, and many of the characters were created just for the movie, so it would be cool if they released more films and expanded on that, telling more of the story and creating new adventures.
B00004YZFR|5.0|This appears to be a true and accurate record of these events. Very absorbing and of significant historical interest. The music is good as well!!
0739365894|2.0|I was disappointed in this book. Jack Reacher (my favorite character) and Dick Hill (favorite narrator) were the only things that kept me listening to the CD.  The basic storyline was not nearly as exciting as the rest of the Reacher series.  Nothing more to say, except I'll wait for Jacks next adventure.
1576754227|3.0|Good quick read!<br /><br />In essence, this is yet another book to stop procastinating and start doing.<br /><br />I like the style in which it is narrated, interesting.<br />There is nothing very new I found that I did not find in other similar books. What I however liked is the tittle and relating some content to the title.<br /><br />A quick read. Borrow this book if you can. I would not recommend a buy!
0385340567|5.0|I have never read Lee Child before but I accidently did not respond to a book clubs monthly choice in time so I got this book in the mail and I have to say I was pleasantly suprised. I have a tendency to stay with the same authors and don't branch out too often but I will have to branch out more, Child's main character is a cross between Steven Segal before he got old and out of shape and Brad Pitt he is macho yet kind and has a great sense of duty and humor, plus he can really kick some butt. The fight scences are descriptive but not overtly gross and you can immagine the small town aptly named \\"Despair\\" especially if you have ever driven across country...need I say more, its hard to review this without giving away the plot except to say it has a lot of action and a lot of twists and even though you think you might know how it is going to end it is still somewhat surprising, and there is just enough semi romance to make it a good read for both women and men. I highly recommend this author and I will be reading more of his books to follow his charachter who has a wandering soul and a gypsy life.
B00003CXPD|5.0|\\"Billy Elliot\\" is a great film about an 11-year-old boy (Jamie Bell) who has an amazing talent for ballet dancing. Unfortunately for Billy, his coal-miner father (Gary Lewis) isn't exactly the type of man who appreciates the art of dance, and he insists that his son take boxing lessons instead. Unable to stifle his passion, Billy continues to train in secret with the help of his ballet teacher (Julie Walters). Eventually Billy has the opportunity to audition for a major dance academy, and his father finds out what his son has been doing behind his back all this time. Major family drama ensues, but everything manages to fall in place at the end.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie. It's heartwarming, inspirational, and incredibly funny. The cast is amazing, and Bell's dance routines are outstanding. This is a great, feel-good film that everyone will enjoy.
0441003257|5.0|I have (at least) two copies of this book in case it becomes necessary for me to insist that a friend borrow and read it immediately. That way I won't be without it for that length of time.  This book has me in tears of laughter every time I read it.
0385340567|5.0|This book was fine. It's not the best Reacher novel, but neither is it 'politicized' as so many are whining about. I suspect most of the Mensa members on here crying are graduates from some Evangelical School of Advanced learning (wait, I'm choking). This is a good read, and the author is surely better off losing these lowbrows who logged on to simper. Some fans you just don't want.
B0014I4KIK|1.0|My Wife and I picked this album up from a local best buy. I guess the selling point was the song \\"MERCY\\".  I am sad to say that this is hardly a highlight but thee only passable song on the whole album.  The songs could be great if she could show some emotion. I literally thought I was listening to a retro Britney Spears. You can taste the potential you could see why she has a recording contract.  Maybe give it some time a couple more years to develope and the follow up to this may be unbeleivable. But frankly this album is a grave dissapointment. Download \\"Mercy\\" and be on your way.
0452289963|5.0|I bought 10 copies and I am going to purchase one more copy to give away.  I sent 9 of the 10 copies to my sisters, my daughters and one niece and brother and I also kept one for my husband and me to read together.  It is so good and the content is written in a way that have you thinking and looking into your life all over again. If you can look at the world through this book's content and look at your life that you understand, you will value the work that Eckhart Tolle has given to us.     Everytime one of my family members tell me of a problem that they are having I tell them to read the book, it will help them to understand what they are dealing with and assist them to solve it if possible to solve.    I recommend the book to everyone and heard about the book on Oprah one evening.    Love it and thans to Mr. Tolle for taking the time to do his research and sharing it with us.

B00164DWEA|4.0|I think the movie exceeds my expectation after I read the critic.    I think it is almost as good as Iron Man movie for the comic fans. The people behind the Hulk seems trying too hard to put some story behind the movie. I would rather to see more Hulk action.    Anyhow I hope they keep the franchise moving.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Despite the frivolous, not to say silly, plot, \\"Help!\\" is just plain fun; and, if one gets past the frantic antics, it is full of delightful puns and allusions (some are very British). The adorable four are supported by an A-1 cast, including Leo McKern, who puts as much zest into his role as the evil Clang as he does into that of Rumpole. Victor Spinetti (who was also in \\"A Hard Day's Night\\"), chews the scenery as the mad scientist, Foot, and he is ably assisted by Roy Kinnear as the dippy Algernon. Eleanor Bron is outstanding as the mysterious Ahme, who, decked out in an outrageous peacock blue turban and plumes informs the lads that there is more to her than meets the eye. Each one of us probably has our favorite scene; mine is one in which Ringo in the cellar is told not to worry about the Bengal tiger; all he has to do to calm the beast is sing the \\"Ode to Joy\\" from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony; and then all the Beatles and everyone else in the pub above the cellar belt it out in German! Goofy, but so what? It's fun!<br /><br />The second disk with the commentary is particularly enlightening. Not only are there the very interesting comments of the director, Richard Lester, but there is also a fascinating explanation by the technicians on the intricacies of restoring the film. Wendy Richard, who plays Miss Brahms, in \\"Are You Being Served?\\", talks about the thrill of playing her very first role in \\"Help!,\\" only to discover at the last minute that the scene had been cut (They show bits and pieces of it).<br /><br />\\"Help!\\" is a film to watch on a summer night when you just want to sit back, relax, and have a good laugh.
B00004XPPK|5.0|In discussions about classic cinema \\"Gilda\\" is a movie that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as [[ASIN:B00009W0WM Casablanca (Two-Disc Special Edition)]].  \\"Gilda\\" has a darker plot and the characters are not as noble, but story, cast, costumes, and music combine to create screen magic.  Think of \\"Gilda\\" as a riveting Anti-Casablanca.<br /><br />Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) is an American drifter who has somehow landed in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  He needs cash to survive and takes his chances using loaded dice to gamble with sailors.  Quitting while he is ahead, Johnny leaves the dice game with a big bankroll and is accosted in the port by a gunman.  To his surprise, the holdup is thwarted by a passerby, Ballin Mundson (George Macready). One thing leads to another and eventually Johnny becomes Mundson's devoted right hand man and the manager of his very lucrative casino business.  After taking an extended overseas business trip, Mundson returns to Buenos Aires with a bride - Gilda (Rita Hayworth).  Mundson introduces Johnny and Gilda, hoping these two important people in his life will like each other.  He doesn't realize that Gilda and Johnny have known each other in the past, and both have been trying to escape their painful shared history together.  Sparks fly between them as Gilda does everything in her power to torment Johnny, and Johnny is equally determined to make Gilda feel cheap and insignificant.  After sixty years, the tension between Hayworth and Ford is still palpable.<br /><br />Rita Hayworth was at the height of her beauty and touted as the sexiest woman alive when \\"Gilda\\" was made in 1946.  Even today she still scorches the screen as she tosses her hair and performs a clothed strip tease to the torchy song, \\"Put the Blame on Mame.\\"<br /><br />This print of \\"Gilda\\" has been restored by UCLA with funding from Sony Pictures.  The black and white video has been cleaned up beautifully.  There are still some white spots that flash from time to time but overall this version looks very good.  The sound track is clear with no dead spots or unexpected drops in volume.<br /><br />Rita Hayworth was a beautiful dancer, but she did not do her own singing.  In \\"Gilda\\" she is lip syncing to the voice of Anita Ellis.  The notable songs, \\"Put the Blame on Mame\\" and \\"Amado Mio\\" are available on both the [[ASIN:B00004T25I Gilda]] soundtrack album or Anita Ellis [[ASIN:B00004YLI0 Out in Front]].<br /><br />The DVD includes a display of vintage advertising for \\"Gilda\\" as well as theatrical trailers.

The most prominent bonus is a featurette about the career of Rita Hayworth at Colombia Studios.  Interesting to see how Rita looked before the studio changed her hairline with electrolysis, and turned her into a redhead.  For those who may not be familiar with her background, Rita was the daughter and granddaughter of professional dancers who had been trained since early childhood to become a talented dancer.<br /><br />This is a classic film noir where everything works.

B000TGJ8CQ|2.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />Based on a story by Phillip K. Dick (probably the most frequently adapted writer of the past thirty years), \\"Next\\" starts off with what would appear to be a can't-miss, sure-fire premise.  In yet another in what is fast becoming a long string of unchallenging roles, Nicolas Cage plays Cris Johnson, a Vegas magician with the uncanny ability to see two minutes into his own future.  So far, he's used this talent only as a part of his stage act and as a means of beating the house at gambling when he heads to the local casinos.  But now he's being asked by the FBI to employ his unique skill in helping to thwart a terrorist plot to detonate a nuclear bomb in downtown Los Angeles.  Cris, however, wants nothing whatsoever to do with saving the world (for reasons that are never made entirely convincing for the audience), so he's off and running through the greater Southwest with both the feds and the bad guys hot on his trail.  It certainly doesn't help that, just on the face of it, this is probably one of the least necessary pursuits in movie history.<br /><br />\\"Next\\" might have been an interesting movie had the writers found a way to really make the time-bending premise believable and compelling, instead of just using it as an excuse to get everybody zipping around in fast-moving cars.  In addition, under Lee Tamahori's directorial aegis and with a screenplay concocted by no fewer than three (!) paid writers, we're treated to cardboard villains with sinister accents, chintzy production values and special effects, incoherently executed gun battle scenes, plot holes one can drive a mack truck through, and a plethora of predictable man-on-the-run, action movie cliches.  Even on a plot level, this gimmicky movie rarely plays fair with its audience, having Cris perform amazing feats that have little or nothing to do with his ability to read the future.  Then, in a final act of disrespect, the filmmakers tack on one of those ridiculous we-were-just-kidding-folks endings that is enough to turn a person off movies forever.<br /><br />In addition to Cage, the movie wastes the considerable talents of Julianne Moore, in yet another of her hysterical, over-the-top law enforcer roles (when is she planning on appearing in a good movie again?), and Jessica Biel, who is at least appealing as the unsuspecting girl Cris drags along on his utterly pointless tri-state spree.<br /><br />\\"Next\\" proves that, even for Nicholas Cage - who has hitherto done pretty well for himself with movies set in Sin City (\\"Leaving Las Vegas,\\" \\"Honeymoon in Vegas\\") - Lady Luck won't always be smiling.hat is enough to turn a person off movies forever.

0316143472|5.0|Rarely do I laugh outloud while reading a book, but that's what happens when you read David Sedaris... and when you least expect it.  I bought the book especially for his essay on stopping his cigarette habit, since I am in the midst of that horror right now.  This man can find humor in ANYTHING!!  The entire book is a treasure. You start out reading rapidly and then find yourself slowing down to savor what he's saying.  The man's outlook on life in general is hilarious!!  I loved it.

I do feel that the publisher's owe it to let us know that these stories are mostly comprised of already released material. That said, if you haven't already read these stories, you might enjoy it. I'm just angry that I had to buy a hardbound copy of stories that I've already read.

Mad Men is also brilliantly acted and the costume/set design is fantastic.  A must buy on Blu Ray due to the amazing encoding, that makes this slick 60's world look its absolute best.  I long for the old days of New York!

So, you can buy this album and you will not regret your money.
0525950079|2.0|Ken Follett's follow-up to the vastly overrated Pillars of the Earth offers nothing new, save the historical events of the Black Death and the Hundred Years War. As in Pillars, his characters are one dimensional; the good are always good, the evil always evil. The plot itself is little more than a far-fetched soap opera recycled from POTE. In addition, I was greatly annoyed at Follett's very unsubtle foreshadowing and constant repetitions to remind his audience of how characters are connected or of various plot points earlier in the book. There are much better examples of medieval historical fiction available, so there is little reason to  slog through the almost 1000 pages of trite fiction of this book.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|I was hesited when I purchased this cd. I grew up when disco was king. I am glad I did purchase it. It's not disco but it's all upbeat music and Donna still has that wonderful voice.I DJ on a part time basis and when I play it I get the people to dance. That is what they pay me to do.Hope this helps.
0792162803|5.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious, for ages teen and older.  My kids especially love the quirky but loveable character played by Molly Shannon and her equally quirky but loveable friends.  If you're looking for something intellectual, keep searching for another movie. If you are looking for something light-hearted that will make you laugh but also has an underlying good premise about not letting anything or anyone keep you down when trying to reach your goal, then this is a movie you will enjoy.
B0000CDWQ9|1.0|Who cam up with this idea to sell this many DVD's in a collection? First off many of the titles listed can be found at any wal-mart for $5.00. So why in the world would anybody see the $600.00 price tag and say \\"HEY! Thats a great deal!\\"<br />I might would consider buying this set if the price was say around $70.00 just so I would break the set up to resell.<br />$600.00 HA!...if anybody has bought this set then they have way too much money and not enough common sense.<br />The words rip off, waste of money, and only the dumb should be in the tags
0525950079|2.0|I read Pillars and like the story a lot.  I read the reviews of World Without End and decided not to buy it but I rented it from the library.  About 300 pages in I stopped reading it.  The story is the same; the young plucky heroine, the smart young builder, etc.  Instead of the building of a cathedral they have to build a bridge (they encounter the same problems).  The characters were shallow and there was no great villain.  If you really liked Pillars, read it again, don't buy this book.
B000FA5Q5E|4.0|This book is a very quick read, only about three hours.  It held me from the short sample downloaded to my kindle until the very end of the book, only stopping to refill my coffee cup.  I am a Nicholas Sparks fan and this is definitely one of my favorites.  I only wish it was longer!
B000VS6P64|5.0|I purchase the CD for a friend of mine and bought one for myself. I'm so glad I did, I have played it everyday since I bought it. It's a wonderful box set, anyone that like Luther music should purchase this box set. I can't forget this, also what a price, great music and a great price. I just want to say thanks. I have been telling all my family and friends about this CD.
0596101996|5.0|This book could easily serve as an introductory text to JavaScript. It offers enough depth for beginning JavaScript. Unfortunately, it does not delve enough into things like closure, which I believe is a very important language features. Furthermore, after the first or second reading, this book can handily serve as a reference book since part 3 and 4 of this book is reference to the classes, methods, and functions that are available in most JavaScript implementation.
B000VWE5OY|1.0|I read the other reviews here, and I'll admit it, they suckered me in. Mentioning CSI, and more importantly Firefly with this series is defamation of character. The special effects are so bad that I went back to look at the box to make sure this wasn't released in the 80's. The first episode was the best, after that I could only muscle through another 5 episodes, each one getting more stilted, and boring, and far fetched. I am a geek, so maybe a little tough, but REALLY, this is about the quality of \\"Earnest goes to (Space) Camp\\". Save your money, I'll give you mine!! Like I said, if you liked the movies on MS 3000 and couldn't understand why they were picking on them, buy this.
0345337581|5.0|I bought this book in the hopes of finding some sort of system that'll help me remember things more effectively and efficiently. This book did that.<br /><br />This book is very readable. It doesn't use heavy terminology nor does it get too deep on some concepts that merely need a few pages to discuss. It stays on focus and encourages you to take a break every now and then to practice what you learned. The practices can be skipped, but they are very good practices.<br /><br />The systems discussed are very practical and can be silly at times. For example, Al likes to BAM (comic book sound effect) and Al likes to ska (term for a type of punk music). For me this is my substitution for Alabama and Alaska, and it helps me remember, in-order, the 50 states. The systems help me remember many things that I need to know for exams or a simple shopping list.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn techniques for remembering things in sequence and out of sequence, peoples names and faces, long lists of numbers, and almost anything else that you need to remember in your daily life.
B0000019PA|5.0|I knew there would be an ocean of reviews for this, and I probably cannot add anything that has not already been said. But I love this album so much, and find so it moving, that on the 10th anniversary of my wife buying and it and playing it for the two of us for the first time, I simply have to express my feelings about it. (In all of her infinite wisdom, she bought this album with no hype, virtually no advance press, a near-total whim. I still remember our reactions listening to it for the first time--try to imagine hearing this with n o  w a r  n i n g   w h a t s o e v e r. We were stunned and stoked when it made amazon's best of '98; we didn't even know anyone outside of Georgia even knew of it.)    By now everyone knows this is a \\"love it or hate it\\" kind of album. But to those of us who know, this is one of the most moving and personal pieces of art you will find--not just in the pop music landscape, but really anywhere. It's just like that: you cry. Not because it is sad, which it is; not because it is intimate approaching naked, which it is; not because it is stunningly inventive, which it is; not because it is beautiful, which it is; not because it is completely out of left field, which it is; but because it is all of these things at once, and it alternates between rambling torrents of visceral energy seemingly from line to line. And about the singing--ya know, he HAS to sing it like that. That need to \\"get it all down\\" that Mangum's out of control singing conveys is what most makes the album so singularly unique and heartfelt--so absolutely full of immediacy and abandon.    We all lament Mr. Mangum's disappearance from the scene because, selfishly, we want more. We want to see this performed in person, to meld with its soul, and with its making in front of us. But we all must know that this is what happens when someone makes something so perfect: there really is nowhere else to go and nothing else to do. It has happened, and lightning was not meant to strike twice.    Thank you so much, Jeff, for sharing it with us.
B000002UAO|5.0|I was amazed to find a couple of songs on here that I didn't remember. This has a lot of my favorites. If you are a Beatle fan, I would definately recommend 'Rubber Soul'.

B0010X745K|3.0|The realism of the people and small-town settings portrayed here draws us in and bands us together with the party trapped in a grocery store, waiting out the coming of whatever ferocity is in the surrounding mist. The camera work and lighting puts us right in the faces of the frightened, beleaguered shoppers. I felt as if I were walking directly behind the store manager, peering over his shoulder as he circulates around the store, whispering counsel, quelling rising tempers, helping to plan escape. Toby Jones does a brilliant job in this part, a total departure from his role as Truman Capote in \\"Infamous.\\"    All the actors turn in compelling, realistic performances as each in turn gets spotlighted in the beam of whatever improvised light the shoppers devise when night falls and their power is cut.     However, I can't be quite as enthusiastic about the creatures that strike out of the mist. Sometimes these artifacts, with their improbably akimbo limbs and their almost human, craning, questioning faces - even seem to be vaguely comical. With all the advances that have been made in fabrication and CG effects in recent years, these menacing arthropods still didn't seem to match the frightening realism of the attackers in decades-old movies such as \\"Them.\\"    Still, the movie is worth watching. It will take you out of yourself into that store-under-siege.    Not all of the bonus material on the DVD is as worthwhile though. The Director's commentary is a little flat and uninformative and you can skip it unless you have a lot of extra time. It will be enough to listen to the Director's chat with Stephen King, from whose early short story/novella this picture was drawn. And you can also listen to just the commentary accompanying the movie's outtakes to get enough of an idea of the budget techniques used to create the effects in this film.
B00005JKG9|5.0|This is just a joy to watch. The masterful, powerful and elegant screenplay by David Mamet is compelling. The characters come alive in their minimalist settings. Despite their despicable professional lives, they successfully garner the viewers respect for what they do by their passionate dialog. Al Pacino is good as always, but Jack Lemmon steals the show in this one.
0375758992|3.0|Although mostly well-written, this memoir is very depressing. I was expecting more about Africa from this NF book, but it's largely the tale of a highly dysfunctional family that suffers blow after blow, bringing much of it on itself. And no one seems to learn anything from their mistakes. The Book of Job is uplifting reading by comparison.
0765342294|5.0|Orson Scott Card is a GENIUS! Ender's Game was fast-paced and vividly detailed. It was so realistic, but had just the right amount of detail to keep you hooked. Never bored me at all. I loved it in 6th grade and still love it all these years later. This book converted me to a science-fiction lover, even though I didn't like to read much before. Wow! Definitely a 5-star book!

1582701709|5.0|Simply from reading (and applying) \\"The Secret\\", \\"Feel it Real!\\", and \\"Ask and It Is Given\\" I manifested financial wealth. These three books should be in everyone's LOA Library. Bottom line. The Secret works.
0156034026|4.0|Just as with his former novel, Moth Smoke (in my mind, a superior novel), Mohsin Hamid's Reluctant Fundamentalist is crafted to be a real page-turner.  I read it in one sitting, and was completely absorbed with the story -- a monologue by a Princeton-educated, former valuation specialist speaking to a jittery American in Pakistan.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned the symbolism of the names, and certainly that is here:  our protagonist, Changez, weaves a story about his time in America, including his love affair with (AM)-Erica and her obsession with her dead love Chris (Christ?  Christopher Columbus?  Both work).  The beauty of Erica fades and she becomes more mentally diseased;  at the same time, the beauty of America fades for the protagonist.<br /><br />He is among the best and the brightest.  So -- as Mohsin Hamid surely intended -- it is with a feeling of shock when, after the Twin Towers are struck -- \\"Changez smiled.\\"  And herein lies the problem.  There is nothing in the pages preceding these two words that indicate that this would be Changez's reaction. He relates that he, indeed, feels at home in New York and loves the city;  certainly, he is enamored of one of its inhabitants, and he thrives at his capitalist job.<br /><br />The slim novel then takes a turn as the protagonist denounces American imperialism.  While this denouncement can lead to stimulating (even heated) debate among intelligent and analytical people, a reader must take it in context of the world the author has created.  I didn't quite understand THIS character's change of heart.<br /><br />In the symbolism of the novel, it is no surprise that there must be a double betrayal with a character representing America and one representing Pakistan.  I do recommend this novel, particularly for the strong writing of Mohsin Hamid.  But I suggest that readers get their hands on \\"Moth Smoke\\", which was a better book.
0307237702|4.0|good book, political writings intermixed with personal experiences to convey the ideas in a better way. I´m planning to keep it and re read chapters from time to time.
B000000W5N|5.0|To extract the essence of the golden age of music (60s to early 80s), you need only spend time on about 10 groups/artists, the top 5 of which must include Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and, of course, The Rolling Stones.<br /><br />Marrow lies in the center, right inside the bones, and for the Stones that marrow is fittingly to be found in that middle period which includes 'Exile on Main Street', 'Get Yer Ya Yas Out', 'Let it Bleed' and 'Sticky Fingers'.<br /><br />And of that marrow, the marrow is Sticky Fingers - without a doubt. While the other albums are all masterpieces, Sticky Fingers is so great that it is worth sending out into space to show alien life what the highest of Homo sapiens can create.<br /><br />And it gets better - the marrow of this album is none other than 'Can't you hear me knocking', a masterful mini-rock-symphony that showcases brilliant composition, a solid, ever advancing and overwhelming avalanche of virtuosity that incorporates pulsating latin-jazz sounds that make even Santana's masterpiece 'Abraxas' seem temporarily lame.<br /><br />This album is The One. Get it now, or you'll regret it forever.

B000002P7R|1.0|I regard Jimi Hendrix as one of the greatest artists of the golden age of rock; his debut album 'Are you experienced' is one of the great debut albums of the age, 'Live at Monterey' is one of the definitive rock performances of all time, and 'Axis: bold as love', 'Smash Hits', 'Band of Gypsys' & 'Electric Ladyland' rank among the finest rock albums of all time.<br /><br />However, 'South Saturn Delta', a posthumous release of senseless studio jamming, should have been left in the archives or have been issued with a warning. I bought this album to complete my Hendrix collection. Sadly, that's about where it ends - the album completes my collection but never gets listened to.<br /><br />The music consists rambling permutations and combinations of Hendrix motifs that seem to come from nowhere and go nowhere. The end result is boring, completely unsatisfying, and detracts from the meteoric CV of the master. This is a sleeping dog that should have been left lying.
0316113506|5.0|This is a brief for exercise as an element of brain fitness. The author is a Harvard Medical School Professor. There is a lot of science here --any more and I would have been lost. The idea is simply this --we are designed to be moving animals. Our brains are controlled by chemicals which must be kept in balance and cells which must be replensished and grow. Vigorous, regular exercise, like a pill we take every morning but wihtout the side effects, helps manage all of this complexity. We don't know exactly how this works but it works and is  a prescription to ward off stress, depression, anxiety, dementia and other like afflictions which all have biochemical roots. In the same way that exercise benefits the heart, Dr. Raney persuasively argues it benefits the organ of the brain. My advice--read the book, go out and get a heart monitor and make vigorous exercise a standard part of your day and life.
0316010669|3.0|Mr. Gladwell is very talented.  He certainly did his homework on this one.  At the end of the book though I was left wondering, \\"Okay...so what is the conclusion?\\"  The book came to a rather abrupt ending and I couldn't tell if the author was for or against snap judgments.    My biggest disappointment is that there was no warning regarding explicit language.  I was listening to this work on CD with my young daughters in the car when all of a sudden he starts using profane words in an effort to quote others.  Was it necessary to include such language?
B0013FSL3E|5.0|When I was watching this movie. It was hard to hold back the tears. Wall-E definitely gets my vote for best animated movie of all time. I found it remarkable that I could tear up and care for this movie and its characters like that. The messages (ie the environment and love) sent in the movie werent too preachy and overally dramatic. This movie is proof that you can express emotion without many words. I would definitely watch this movie again. It is a timeless masterpiece

B0013J30W2|2.0|'Wanted' is a current blockbuster with a great cast (Freeman, Jolie, MacAvoy, Kretschmann ...) It is a story about an assassin fraternity, founded ages ago by weavers, of all people.<br />The best that I can find to say about this waste of time is that Angelina Jolie is in it and that she has learned shooting in circles. Another boomerang is invented by Morgan Freeman, who seems to need money badly and can't refuse any part, apparently; he selects a prospective assassin and trains him for coming back at him in the end. I guess it doesn't matter much giving away endings here, as plot suspense is hardly what this materiel destruction is after.<br />The 'hero' is unlikely MacAvoy, who is a decent actor but not quite believable as action superman.<br />Well, should I give a second star just for Jolie and maybe a little bit for all my Chinese Zodiac siblings who light up the house? Ok, why not.<br />That is actually a good idea, the rat twist, but it lacks feasibility, frankly. But then everything else in the story also does, so it does not matter.
B0013D89YM|5.0|This album, more than any other, is the one people think of when the subject of ELO comes up.  At the time this came out, a bunch of my friends and I went to see them for the \\"Out of the Blue\\" tour.  It was marvellous, with saucer, laser show, and an over-the-shoulder cello rendition of \\"Flight of the Bumblebee.\\"  Ah, memories!<br /><br />The songs on OOTB are very eclectic, too, which I think makes it a memorable album.  There's \\"a little something for everyone.\\"  My favorite album side was \\"Concerto for a Rainy Day,\\" the four-song blitz of \\"Standin' In The Rain,\\" \\"Big Wheels,\\" \\"Summer & Lightening,\\" and \\"Mr. Blue Sky.\\"  The mad harpsichord sound in the first song gets me going!<br /><br />Glad this album got a good reissue and some bonus tracks, it deserves it.
0743298039|5.0|I was looking for a good story and an easy summer vacation read. The Thirteenth Tale fits the bill. It's a page turner and a great Gothic story. The characters are rather shallow, but that's okay, because their only reason for existence is the story, and the story does not dissapoint. The writing is not extraordinary or particularily memorable (I have not written down any quotes), but it is solid and facilitates this original tale. Recommended.
B00006CXSS|5.0|DVD's came in excellent condition and on time. They were brand new as advertised. No problems at all.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|I was really surprised how good this anime was. I'm a casual fan of Anime, but liking it more and more.<br />This story is kind of hard to explain. It's basically of two young boys living by themselves in the big city in the poorest part of town. They are orphans. One older than the other. The older one looking after the young one. It's very depressing and sad through most of the story. Kind of reminds me of the mood in \\"Grave of the Fireflys\\". A lot of violence as you could imagine.<br />The art work in this is as good as I've seen. Beautiful coloring. You cannot look away it's so good. And the creativity that went into the story along with the art is the best it can be.<br />All I can say is you have to see for yourself. Give it a try. I think you'll like it.<br />Really good music at the end when the credits appear.<br />Very unusual Anime. Highly recommended. Worth watching many times over.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|I love this album.  I played it at a local bar/restaurant and the crowd was very excited.  Many of them were in their 20s and only thought of Donna as an oldies act.  The album is very current and exciting!  For those few of you giving it one or two stars give it another listen and make sure you crank it up!
B000ASDFJU|1.0|Shame on the manufacturer of the 2005 copyright of the complete series of Sex and the City. I finally bought the set after my cases totally fell apart on most of my seasons. I have returned two series sets because whole episodes and WHOLE ENTIRE DISKS dont work. And not just in my dvd player, but in my laptop and in best buys dvd station (where i took the set to exchange) It is a factory malfunstion and I was dissapointed to see that there are posts coming from years back that had the same problem. I am a HUGE fan of the show, and yet I cant BUY a gift set that works! None of them DO!!!!    I am going to look for the newly copyrighted set and see if HBO ever changed vendors. I am getting very dissapointed however.

006135323X|5.0|Predictably Irrational<br /><br />Dan Ariely has written a brilliant book that makes behavioural economics as palatable as some of his food and beverage stories.<br /><br />There is not a person on this earth who has not been surprised sometimes about the dumb choices he/she has made, particularly during stores' sales. Ariely salves the wounded part of the brain responsible for these out-of-character decisions and explains that we all make bad decisions, sometimes.<br /><br />As a school administrator, duty of care demands that someone stays behind with the child who has not been picked up by an errant parent. We discussed ways of addressing the problem, including fines. Ariely (p. 76) points out that relationships are often defined as either social exchanges or market exchanges, and in the case that he described how a day care centre introduced fines for tardy parents. This meant that the parents shifted from a sense of social exchange guilt to a market exchange monetary cost. When parents worked out the amount of the fine, they then made a decision about meeting the pickup time. He warned that \\"once a social norm is trumped by a market norm- it will rarely return\\". A great warning for us.<br /><br />A second timely warning he issued educators relates to performance-based salaries. The danger is that the majority of teachers, who are driven by the moral notion of doing \\"good\\" for students, will be moved from social norms to market norms. Taylorist managerialist decisions are problematic in teaching.<br /><br />Basically, the book is a good read. It is entertaining, insightful and educative. A 5/5 from me.

B0016A2FFG|4.0|As has been mentioned by others, \\"Lay it Down\\" is Al Green's latest effort to replicate the sound that kept him a mainstay on radio during the early 70's.  Each of the eleven tracks, including his collaborations with the likes of Anthony Hamilton (on two tracks), Corinne Bailey Rae, and John Legend, features Green at his most soulful, backed by musicians/arrangers that truly know how to support such a legendary talent.<br /><br />The album's highlight is actually one of the duets: the one with Rae, entitled \\"Take Your Time.\\"  The young singer's unique vocals match Green's heartfelt crooning perfectly, making one long to hear the two on some future effort.<br /><br />The only complaint of the CD, resulting in the loss of a star, is that a couple of the tracks sound TOO much like each other, making them somewhat interchangeable, adding a little confusion to the listening ear.<br /><br />One might ask, \\"Didn't I just hear that song?\\" as the album makes its spins on the CD player.<br /><br />With that said, however, \\"Lay it Down\\" is still a welcome pleasure for fans of Green and real rhythm and blues, not the Usher/Chris Brown/Justin Timberlake type that passes for the genre today.
B00133KFGW|5.0|It's easy to point out the incongruities of Kirsten Sheridan's magical \\"August Rush\\"...an 11-year-old who learns guitar in one night, and piano and musical composition in another...but this is not a movie for nitpickers, but for dreamers, and all of us who hear music in everything we experience. And boy, does this film deliver!<br /><br />I wasn't surprised to see Nick Castle's hand in the screenplay, as he is an old hand at finding magic in our cynical world (he wrote and directed \\"The Boy Who Could Fly\\"); here, we have the story of two incredibly gifted musicians, a Julliard-trained cellist (Keri Russell), and a self-taught Irish rock singer/composer (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), who bond under the stars in New York City, then are torn apart by families with their own agendas. She carries his child, but after an accident, her ambitious father (William Sadler) steals the newborn, dumps the baby into social services, and announces to the daughter that the child had died. What is MEANT to be, never happens, the lives of both musicians unravel, and they soon give up their gifts, for mundane careers...as their unknown child (the remarkable Freddie Highmore) grows into a musical prodigy, on a mission to find them.<br /><br />The bulk of the film deals with the child's search, and the remarkable people he meets along the way, from a sympathetic welfare worker (Terrence Howard), to a gifted child guitarist and his Fagin-like mentor (Leon Thomas III and Robin Williams, who is creepy, but excellent), and finally, a powerful child gospel singer, and her pastor (Jamia Simone Nash and Mykelti Williamson). Dubbed 'August Rush' by Williams, the boy harnesses his prodigious musical talents, even as his parents individually renew their own musical careers, and are drawn back to New York City, and a tear-inducing, spectacular climax. Predictable? You bet, but I dare you not to be moved, anyway!<br /><br />The performances are first-rate, particularly from the child actors, and the music is awesome. This is unabashedly a 'feel-good' movie, the perfect flick to pop into the DVD player when you're feeling down.<br /><br />My only real quibble is the lack of Special Features; extended scenes are all that are offered, and this is a film I'd have loved learning more about...<br /><br />\\"August Rush\\" is a wonderful film that shouldn't be missed!bashedly a 'feel-good' movie, the perfect flick to pop into the DVD player when you're feeling down.

B000ZLFALI|2.0|NOTE:  I would just like to preface this review with the statement that I have been a die-hard fan of The Beatles since I was 6 years old, have all their albums, and know every song by heart.  They are the band that has been, in my opinion, and always will be the best rock n' roll band in history.<br /><br />Having said that, this movie was a complete disaster and beyond tedious.  The premise was good; the execution, however, was just miserable and a complete failure. Most of the musical interpretations are decent, but the whole thing is like a 2 hour MTV video/reality show/after school special. The characters are trite and they do nothing for the film or The Beatles, except that their names are Lucy, Prudence, Sadie, Max, Jojo, and Jude, based on top songs of The Beatles.<br /><br />The story of the 60s protest of the war backdrop made this film even more insulting as it was used more as scenery rather than a real character, especially for such a poignant part in political history.  It mocked the upheaval during that time, making the war seem more like an afterthought.  There is hardly anything about this film that deserves any praise.  It is filled with bad acting, bad scenes, and bad directing.  Julie Taymor's directing skills in this movie were non-existent, which was surprising, especially with her success with the movie 'Frida' under her belt.<br /><br />Jim Sturgess (or rather, his voice) was the only thing that kept me watching this movie, albeit begrudgingly.  He was also the best actor of the bunch, not that that's saying much.  The movie follows Jude's (Sturgess) journey after coming to America, he being the central character that ties the others together.  But the whole story seems to take place within the time span of a month, which makes it completely phony, especially the characters.  They had no depth and barely helped the movie at all.  There is too much fit into a small amount of time that I couldn't believe how callous and cold-hearted these characters ended up being.  If you take the series of events in the limited time that they were portrayed, some of the characters are cold and uncaring, to say the very least.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on Evan Rachel Wood.  Her acting was so bad that it's too bad she was the only \\"known\\" actress in this movie.

0385340567|2.0|I'm really surprised at this Lee Childs book.  I always wait with anticipation for the release date of Jack Reacher's story, and this time was no different.  But, rather than sitting down for one long reading to finish the book, it took me three weeks to get through this one.  I had no problem laying it down, and starting other books while this laid unfinished. I eventually finished reading it, but it was an effort.
B00132D808|5.0|Everyone expected this album to sound similar to the last and got disappointed.  So did I at some point. I missed the racey, danceable style that the last album entailed, but this album is just as catchy and enjoyable.  At least the lyrics are just as random here. I would say this album would really seem interesting to an older-aged fanbase; I wouldnt expect these songs to be audibly appealing to grade-schoolers and most teenagers.  I love the various familiar musical styles that are featured in this album. really brings you to a different atmosphere. \\"When the Day Met the Night\\" is my absolute favorite song for the whole summer now and will likely stay as one my favorite love songs.  The album is great if you give it a chance and if you've actually liked the Beatles and have a decently broad appreciation for music.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|So, my one and only New Year resolution this year was to read more and I have succeeded.  So, how does this movie fit into that?  Well, I am interested in reading classics.  I've always loved period piece movies; Howards End, Sense and Sensibility, Bleak House, to name a few.  So, not really knowing what this movies was about (just a general idea) I got it, popped it in and was sucked in.  WOW!  I watched this movie with my mom who got just as sucked in as I did.  My husband who does NOT watch movies with accents or lacking some sort of shoot out, actually ended up watching it with us as well.  LOL.  Having no other version to compare it to, I just have to say that this was done so well.  Is this castle available for rent?  For me, Jane being thrilled with having family over money truly sums it up.  She KNOWS what is important and finally finding it, won't let it go.  Enjoy this!

B00005JPLW|1.0|I watched this film as it was on Sky Premiere yesterday and just had to comment about this ludicrous racist claptrap, worse than a throwback to 19th Century Orientalist myths.I had just finished reading The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity (written by an Israeli. A recent History Channel programme entitled Sparta actually had American professors exclaiming that the Spartans saved Western Democracy!!! Such brazen false propaganda and conflation of such distant and indirectly connected historical phenomena raises the question of the level of intellectual ability and reasoning capacity required to become a professor of Ancient History in the USA and the pretended impartiality of the presentations of Western documentaries. Kostos Vlassopolous (a real Greek),in his recent Unthinking the Greek Polis, the question of how modern Westerners have appropriated the clearly non-Western ancient Greeks as their supposed genius progenitors. Martin Bernal in his famous Black Athena: The Afro-Asiatic Roots of Classical Civilization also showed how Western 'Classics' had fabricated the myth of Ancient Greece. More recently, given that this absurd film ends with the claim that Plataea was a victory against Mysticism and Tyranny, one should note that Plato (a century after Plataea) is quite clearly a mystic and philosophy is itself a mystical enterprise for him although Western historians and Classicists have distorted the true meanings of Plato to make him appear like a modern Westerner (see Thomas McEvilley's The Shape of Ancient Thought). Furthermore, as McEvilley and others note, the Greek simpletons would not even have had philosophia and transcendental monism if the Persian Achaemenid empire had not allowed the Greeks in Ionia to encounter Indian yogis from whom the Greeks learnt of the transcendental and philosophia (the love of divine wisdom - a clearly mystical practise- Plato talks of opening the Inner Eye and being flooded with (divine) Light)etc. as well as transcending Reason).      To all the teenage boys who watch this childish film, I suggest that you note the following. Persians were not Black africans as the early part of this film portrays them. Spartans were totalitarian, proto-fascist slave owners (not shown on the film) who went to war each with 7 Greek helot slaves accompanying them! The Greek city of Argos refused to fight with the Greeks as they were at war with Sparta and would rather be ruled by Persia than Spartans! The Persians allowed democracy to be maintained in the Ionian Greek City states which revolted against them. Most Greek city states were not democratic. Sparta asked the tyrant of Syracuse in Sicily to help fight Xerxes. As Isaacs notes, the Greeks were not fighting for individual liberty, simply against collective foreign subjugation. Plato detested Democracy. Only male citizens of pure-lineage had the vote in Athens (the modern West and its 'democracy' are rooted in the more recent Protestant Reformation in Western Europe not in ancient Greece). After Plataea, Xerxes invited a Spartan commander to a feast. As Herodotus, the first historian wrote, the Persians more than any other peoples acknowledged valour in their opponents. Sparta and Athens, after defeating Xerxes went on to imperialist subjugation and enslavement of other Greeks! Spartas success in the Peloponnesian War against Athens was funded largely by Persia!     The Greek speaking part of the Roman Empire became Byzantine and the Greek Church the Eastern Orthodox Church as opposed to western Roman Chrsitianity from which the modern West arose. On a British documentary about Stalin, his father-in-law is supposed to have stated that Stalin was a tyrant as he was an Asiatic from Georgia. In fact, Georgians are the descendants of the Greeks (Colchis etc.)! Unlike Greece, slavery was uncommon in ancient India (in contrast to the Asiatic slavery myth). Modern Greece itself was partly the creation of Western Romantics (like Byron) whereas thenatives of the Greek peninsula under Ottoman rule called themselves Romii and spoke Romaika.     Thus those of you teenagers with a little bit of brainpower should treat this racist nonsense and the historians on History Channel etc. spurting their bile about ancient Greece with the contempt it deserves.
B000YABYLA|3.0|I thought Juno was an interesting film overall. Ellen Page is absolutely magnificent in the central role and Michael Cera fit well the part he plays. Personally, I was a bit skeptical of Juno's essence as a character. She struck me as being partially a male fantasy of what a girl would be like as it's improbable that a high school kid nowadays would have anywhere near the type of musical education she possesses (or walk around with an unlit pipe in her mouth). Page's Juno is highly engaging as a personality and it's hard to take your eyes off of her though. Also, I thought Jennifer Garner and Justin Bateman put in solid backup performances. Juno is entertaining and fun even if its intricacies sometimes make it a challenge to suspend disbelief.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|brilliant!! unsurpassable by Foo's standards. this CD didnt quickly become a favorite of mine until i found myself constantly grabbing it if i was going somewhere for a long drive or if it was nice out. i dunno why i just really liked it.     disk 2 stayed in its case for more than a year before i listened to it after the first time i got it. i remember thinking, ok this is good, better than i remembered and then after a few spins within a few days it hit me that it was actually AWESOME, the songs are so so good. On The Mend being a favorite of mine and undoubtly one of my all time fav Foo songs.
B000001GXI|4.0|This recording is the third of the three Magic Flutes conducted by Karl Boehm that are available; it was recorded in Berlin in 1964.  Boehm's conducting was little changed from the previous recordings (1941 & 1955); tempi were moderate yet lively and dramatic, his phrasing was nuanced and the various voices are well balanced.  As expected, the sound is the best of the three versions.  Dialog is included.     The widely hailed Fritz Wunderlich sang Tamino.  His voice was beautiful, and his technique was faultless.   If there is a complaint to be made, it is that he didn't seem to adjust his style for the period of the music - his Tamino is not stylistically different from his Nemorino or his Lensky.  Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, who also sang Papageno on the Fricsay recording, gives us a rather thoughtful, studied bird catcher - somewhat at odds with the usual characterization.  His clear, light voice is reminiscent of Willi Domgraf-Fassbaender on the Toscanini recording; he exhibits no notable flaws of technique or style, but doesn't imbue the character with much personality.    Roberta Peters sang The Queen of the Night. Her voice was not large or rich, and its tone thinned considerably on the higher notes.  She handled the technical aspects of the roll well, but like many others in the role, she seemed to be concentrating so hard on accuracy, that not much personality came through.  Evelyn Lear (Pamina) sings accurately, but, she sounds precise and correct rather than moving.  Franz Crass has an attractive voice and sings very well - one of the better Sarastros.    This recording, the other Boehm recording (1955) and the Klemperer (EMI) are all good representatives of the rather romantic manner of performing Mozart in the mid 20th century. Klemperer is rather slower and more majestic,  It comes down pretty much to which singers you like best.  If you want a fleet, historically informed Magic Flute in modern sound, look to Gardiner, Norrington (very fast) or Christie(not so fast).   If you want a modern \\"not too romantic, not too historically informed\\" but very fine recording, try Abbado's.
B000020617|4.0|while this CD has a lot of very strong material it just doesnt have enough. i found only half of this CD to be worth while and the rest acting in as filler. songs like Learn to Fly and Stacked Actors are very very quickly dismissed and songs like Break Out although very good isnt enough to hold my attention.    this CD is different from other Foo efforts because this is the first time since the S/T debut has Dave been the only one writing and playing the guitar parts.     songs like Aroura and Generator are very very catchy and worthy of praise.     IMO this is a SO SO effort from Foo Fighters.
B000X9325I|2.0|I hope you never hear a recording with worse sound quality than this performance, conducted by Toscanini at Salzburg in 1937.  It has nearly every flaw imaginable: hiss, flutter, wow, cracks, pops, assorted coughs, an extraordinarily limited frequency range, and a muddy texture.  None the less, this is the only recording we have of Toscanini conducting a Mozart opera, and we are fortunate to have it.<br /><br />Music lovers born in the latter part of the 20th century probably don't realize the fame and popularity of Toscanini in the popular culture of the early and middle part of the century.  Can you imagine a major television network today hiring a classical music conductor for millions of dollars, paying for him to have his own symphony orchestra, and making his concerts an integral part of their prime time programming?  Was Toscanini great enough to warrant such fame?  That depends on \\"matters of taste\\", which can not be argued in a logical manner.  In my opinion: if you enjoy Verdi, you need to have every recording Toscanini made of Verdi's music to know what it should sound like (in spite of his penchant for imperfect and pedestrian soloists).  If Beethoven is your primary interest, stick with Mengleberg, Furtwangler, v. Karajan, Weingartner, Bernstein, Kempe, et al, as your taste dictates.<br /><br />If you can listen through the terrible sound quality, his conducting on this recording is interesting to consider.  It has Toscanini's hallmark characteristics: it is vigorous, precise and has great integrity.  I think a little more charm and humor (not characteristics that he was known for) would have made this a better performance.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, the soloists (with the exception of  Kipnis and Domgraf-Fassbaender) are neither interesting nor pleasant.  Helge Rosvaenge (Tamino) was never an elegant singer.  In Verdi and in verismo roles, he could sing with vigor and elan. Here he sounds awkward and un-princely. Julie Osvath is probably the worst Queen of the Night recorded. She does all right in the slow parts, but when you get to the coloratura, the train goes off the tracks (Florence Foster Jenkins anyone?). Jarmila Novotna was a well regarded singer (primarily in late 19th and early 20th century works) in the `30s & 40's.  As Pamina she sings well enough, but seems uninvolved.<br /><br />Willi Domgraf-Fassbaender, as Papageno, has a light, pleasant voice, which he uses to excellent effect.  One of the very best bird catchers (as nearly as I can tell).  The great Ukranian bass, Alexander Kipnis, uses his deep and sonorous voice to give us a great Sarastro in spite of the slowest tempo I have ever heard for \\"Isis und Osiris\\".  (If you want to hear just how good the famous bass arias of opera can sound, listen to the recordings made by Kipnis in 1930/31.)<br /><br />The bottom line?  This is a recording which you will study with interest rather than listen to with pleasure.ded.

B000QEIORG|4.0|i wont hold this particular version of TCATS to any real standard because a lot of the songs were b-sides added in later. i can tell you its a shame 'Dear Lover' wasnt put on the original release but oh well.     When i first heard this CD back in 97 it was instantly a classic and main stay and while i have had more fun with other Foo Fighters material its easy to come back to this one but only half heartedly. a lot of the songs just cant hold my attention so much anymore which is ok, so with that said i cant give this CD 5 stars.
B0018AK9RA|2.0|First off I've been a huge Judas Priest Fan for over over 25 years and feel their discography up thru defenders is some of the best heavy metal ever written.  Secondly, let me make clear that I'm not just a fan of metal.  I'm also a huge fan of prog rock and conceptual albums which is why I thought this album would be intriguing.  It flat out sucks and I cannot believe the band released this garbage.  For those of you that say this is reminiscent of \\"Sad Wings\\" or \\"Sin after Sin\\", I'd like to know in more detail how you arrived at that notion.  None of this has a \\"Last rose of summer\\" or \\"Dreamer Deceiver\\" feel to it at all.  In fact there is way too much interlude between tracks that is flat out boring and completely lacking any type of technicality or melody, which is very surprising when you consider the greatness of both Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing. I was hoping this could turn out to be a tour in which they could perform the ablum in it's entirety and add a really cool stage setting, but if they tried to pull that off I have a feeling most people would be bored to death.  Releasing this album was not a step in the right direction.  It was a complete waste of 2 years worth of writing and producing.  Take a look at their recent set lists and you'll see that they are currently only playing 3 or 4 tracks at most which is a clear indictaion that the overall buzz is bad.  Maybe the album would have been better if they just wrote independent tracks versus a concept album.  At this point in their careers they shouldn't try and reinvent themselves.
B000002HRE|2.0|better than Load but still not enough for me to care. seriously, who cares what Metallica has to say anymore? arent we over it yet? i mean, they released 4 records that made metal what it is today, no one in a metal band can decline the notion that Metallica paved the way and in a way invented what we know today as american metal but that was 20 plus years ago, do we really care anymore?    there are some decent radio hits on this cd which is what Metallica had been trying to do since 1990 and have succeeded but with time the songs on these later era releases just arent worth the plastic they are put on.     im just so over Metallica and these songs.     dont get me wrong tho, i love Metallica, i love the early era stuff because it still rules over most if not all metal thats around today but do they really have anything left to offer but stale music packaged as an excuse to tour?
B0016A2FFG|3.0|i like the Production and the Instrumentation,but you just can't ever go back and re-capture the past and it sounds gimmicky after a while. Al green vocally is still good. the problems in here lay with the songs which if you are gonna go back in sound then you gotta bring back quality timeless songs and that is the main thing missing here. nothing on here is seeing his great past hey day. the duets aren't necessary either because Al Green didn't need help then and he sure doesn't know. it was a pretty good well played album that just basically lacked that one or two knock out cuts,but on a whole not bad.
0452289963|5.0|The in depth concepts are simply laid out, along with quick and easy techniques to practice in order to drive home the point. It's definitely made a difference in how I live my life and how I think about myself. This book is an easy read with short chapters. I highly reccommend if some one is not typically a \\"book\\" person. I believe this book is a simplified version of \\"The Power of Now\\" but I can't confirm that.
B000002UAU|5.0|I´m not much for worshipping sacred cows. I wouldn´t call PET SOUNDS or DARK SIDE OF THE MOON masterpieces, even if \\"the experts\\" say that they are. And I don´t really care if SGT PEPPER is the birth of modern pop music or important regarding the evolution of artrock.  I just think that the songs on SGT PEPPER are really good. Good enough to get 5 stars.
B000YJ54DU|3.0|While this one of the weaker offerings in the excellent Jack Reacher series, I didn't find it to be the left-wing, pinko, tree-hugging, liberal, anti-Christian rant described by some of the other reviewers.   The story revolves around one misguided 'End of Times Christian' layman preacher who held power over his very small town and was not immune to the abuse of that power. It was not an indictment of Christians in general.  Nor did I think the book maligned our government -- our government had a problem and hired the private sector to solve it.  This happens every day in real life.    My difficulty with the book is that I couldn't hear the siren song that kept calling Jack back to the town of Despair.  I couldn't identify with his need to return to that bleak outpost which had no redeeming qualities. The way Jack Reacher chooses to live has no resemblence to my way of life. However, I don't demand the hero of a book share my world view because these differences are what make the adventures exciting.  And being on the road with Reacher is usually very exciting.  But over and over again bumping back and forth down the highway between the towns of Hope and Despair with Jack was tedious. I highly recommend the series, just not this particular title.  I'm looking forward to the next adventure -- and hoping Jack is back to his old self.
B00164DWEA|2.0|Let's see>>> X-Men, Fantastic Four, & Spiderman used the same cast in its sequels, & I am sure Robert Downey Jr. & Gweneth Paltrow will return for Iron Man 2, BUT Universal COULD NOT USE THE SAME CAST FROM 2003's \\"Hulk\\", for the sequel for a Marvel Character, I mean I know the 2003 film didn't shatter box office records, but does anyone really think William Hurt is a better Col. Ross than Sam Elliot?? & Eric Bana is a much better actor than Edward Norton I think, & does anyone really think Liv Tyler is prettier than Jennifer Connelly???, I know I am ranting but this Hollywood thinking really can kill a film for me, this one picks up where the 2003 film left off, but I had a hard time trying to figure out if it was a true sequel, there are several things wrong here, for starters, Elliot's Ross wanted the Hulk contained, pure & simple, Hurt's Ross wants him for a biological weapon, Tyler's Betty is somwhat leary of Banner, where as Connely's Betty missed him once he was gone & yearned for his return, only Tim Roth's character who becomes Abomintion had any real substance, you just hated this guy, this one it seemed was more action packed whereas the first film was more character driven, the first film had its flaws, but that in my view was no reason to change the cast, If you like the first one, you will be disappointed, If you hate the first one, you will like this one.
B0013FSL3E|3.0|Yes. The movie was cute. Yes. The movie was visually stunning. Yes. The movie was well done. But the one flaw was that it is an in your face enviromental propoganda. I am not opposed to the idea of letting people know that we need to take care of the enviroment and that we need to be aware of the amount of pollution that is building up. But dont yeah think it is a bit much to push this on our small ones? Seriously?! Really?! Do we need to really make it so in your face? Go watch the movie and see what I mean.  The movie is great! I loved it. It was cute. Its just the whole enviroment twist sort of ruins it.  Especially once you realize it.
B0011BGY66|5.0|They may be fresh out of the Ivy League world, but this band of New York boys from Columbia University is making waves on the indie scene.  People can't seem to get enough of Vampire Weekend's self-titled album, with its witty lyrics and afro-pop/new wave/indie sound.  The band generated a fan base last year by playing shows around downtown NYC and circulating a demo.  From synthesizers to the cello, the band's eclectic sound manages to captivate without betraying its innocent simplicity.  The songs on the album are primarily a revamped version of those found on the original demo - including two new tracks, \\"M79\\" and \\"I Stand Corrected.\\"
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I thought this documentary would be boring but I discovered it was just the opposite, it was fascinating!   Al Gore doesn't try to scare you he just presents the facts (and the facts seem to be what the controversy is over but nevertheless, we can all do better in our daily lives). He doesn't rely on future predictions like I thought he would to scare you (he does show them to you through computer models and yes they are scary) but it's more a plea to your common sense side to start doing something about it because we can turn it around if we all work together.   The video also give some suggestions at the very end as to what you can do as an individual to slow this problem down.
B0018DUPTE|5.0|This book is very imformative for Beatles fans and audio philes alike.  The author does not get caught up in the personal dramas of the Beatles, but chronicles his approach to problem solving in the day when multi-track recording technology was just starting to evolve.  He does give some unique observations regarding the Fab 4, but does not seem to be awestruck, having been with them from the very beginning.  Even though recording the Beatles was not always fun it was always eventful.  This is a very special glimpse behind the magic curtain.  I recommend it highly.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Great songs just as I expected.  EJ is always and without hesitation a great performer.  The very reason that he will always be able to demand the best price, the best stage or whatever else he wants.  Never fails to deliver.

B00000IMTF|5.0|there is a very good reason so many people have given this CD such rave reviews. It has got to be Rainbow's masterpiece. Ritchie Blackmore and company have put the pedal to the metal here and the results are fantastic! This is a must-have disc for any metal collection. Ritchie is firing on all cylinders and Ronnie James Dio, one of rock's finest vocalists, sings his heart out, especially on Stargazer, a super track. And it is always a pleasure to hear the drumming of the great and gone-too-soon drummer, Cozy Powell. Rainbow went on to record some good tunes after this album but for me and many others this is their masterpiece. Crank up your hi-fi on Stargazer and let the drums of Cozy Powell lead you into some serious headbangin'!<br />[...]
B000067J1H|5.0|I know this is old news...my daughter introduced me to this movie several years ago...I just watched it again tonight....A great satire on modern american culture....Superb on on every level...should have been awarded  the Oscar for best picture of the  year.....clearly one of the best of the last ten years....
B000003S5H|3.0|Waited years before I finally bought this and now I remember why.  \\"All I Need\\" and \\"Femme d'Argent\\" are delightful summer-day, mellow, fluffy songs.  Except for those, though, this is elevator/shopping mall/quaalude music, especially the last 4 VERY SLOW songs, omg, zzzzzzz....    Moreover, the mix is strangely harsh and metallic for this type of music; the treble seems excessive, making the keyboards and effects almost painfully sharp. It's tolerable on an Ipod with the right EQ setting, but on a home stereo it's shrill even with bass turned up and treble turned down.  This aggravates what would be a minor annoyance: the many unnecessary, sustained high synth tones and even hisses in the background.  These would be subliminal if the mix were right. But they are brought forward, and become noticeable flaws.    My advice: download \\"Femme d'Argent\\" and \\"All I Need\\" as MP3s. Save your CD money for a disc with more good tracks on it.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|I've recently watched these movies and can't believe that I haven't seen them before. Simply fantastic!  I am a new and forever fan of Sylvester Stallone. His writing and acting is first class.  He's an inspiration as Rocky for sure and better yet as simply himself.  Salud!

B000UD0ESA|3.0|XXXXX<br /><br />(Note: This review is for the movie \\"Blade Runner: The Final Cut\\" (2 disc special edition) released in 2007.)<br /><br />This movie is based on the novel \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" (1968) by Philip K. Dick (1928 to 1982).<br /><br />This movie depicts a dystopian (opposite of a utopia) Los Angeles in the year 2019 in which genetically manufactured beings called \\"replicants\\" (visually indistinguishable from adult humans) are used for dangerous and degrading work on Earth's off-world colonies.<br /><br />Following a small replicant (also called a \\"skin-job\\") uprising, replicants become illegal on Earth and specialist police called \\"blade runners\\" are trained to hunt down and \\"retire\\" (kill) escaped replicants trespassing on Earth.<br /><br />Besides the plot, this movie seems to forecast important concerns of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries such as overpopulation, globalization, climate change, and genetic engineering.<br /><br />The plot of this movie is simple.  Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a semi-retired blade runner who's after four ruthless replicants illegally on Earth named Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James), Pris (Daryl Hannah), and Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer).  Deckard accidentally develops a romance with the more sophisticated replicant Rachael (Sean Young).<br /><br />I watched this movie (\\"The Final Cut\\" which is essentially the same as the rushed \\"The Director`s Cut\\") with a friend who did not see the original theatrical release that had Deckard's voice-over narration.  Guess what?  My friend could not follow the story!!!  I could since I'd seen the original release but I found that I still missed Deckard's voice-over.<br /><br />I especially missed the voice-over when the Roy Batty replicant \\"dies\\" at the end of the movie.  This key scene was not as emotionally appealing with the voice-over absent.<br /><br />I think I deduced the reasons why the voice-over is so important to this movie:<br /><br />(1) It allows the viewer to follow the action<br />(2) It provides the human and emotional touch to counterbalance all the technological and visually-stunning special effects<br />(3) It adds a \\"retro\\" feel that reminded me of old-time detective movies<br />(4) The story drags without it.<br /><br />Thus, the obvious question is, \\"Why wasn't there an option to have the voice-over?\\"  Answer: I don't know but it may have to do with marketing.  By having such an option, those who feel the voice-over is integral to the movie would have been satisfied.<br /><br />The ending of the final cut, I felt, was too abrupt.  The original ending gave the feeling that Deckard and the replicant Rachael would have a future together.<br /><br />The special effects that highlight the steel-and-microchip jungle of twenty-first century L.A. and the background music provided by Vangelis are still fantastic and exhilarating.<br /><br />The final cut has about a minute more of extended scenes and never before seen special effects than the original theatrical version and the director's cut.  The entire movie has been digitally restored making the images clean and crisp.  The audio is excellent.  There is a thirty second introduction by director Ridley Scott and three audio commentaries.  The second disc has a three and a half hour documentary making it perhaps the \\"definitive\\" documentary for fans of this movie.<br /><br />BOTTOM  LINE:<br /><br />Without the voice-over narration, this movie (The Final Cut) loses its magnificence and emotional impact.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION:<br /><br />Get the four or five disc \\"Collector's Edition\\" where one disc has the original theatrical released version (that easily is a five-star movie) with Deckard's voice-over narration.

B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Groundhog Day - 15th Anniversary Edition is the perfect film to watch when you are in a funk. Hopefullly this hit film will put a smile on your face afterwords, Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell are heavenly together. They have great chemistry and you believe their love/hate relationship. This is director's Harold Ramis second best film after National Lampoon's Vacation, I just love his movies. I highly recommend purchasing this classic, enjoy!
B00125WAWS|5.0|A truly inspirational film...    By now, we have seen this film several times, but last night... Lisa and Pablo Moreno, Alessandra Prado, Nadya, Alex and I watch because we were engaged on a rather deep debate over the political contenders for this year's election... and we decided to share with them a movie that truly explains the meaning of a debate... A war of ideals, perceptions and opinions... where our weapons are... words!!!    After seeing this movie for the first time, I researched the story only to realize that the story is based on a real life story that inspired a change of the way our Nation thinks and planted the seeds for the Civil Rights movement in the United States.    Melvin B. Tolson, played by one of our favorite actors, Denzel Washington is a professor at a college in Texas that encourages young people to participate in the discovery of the fire within... as he tells one of his students during a training lesson: \\"we are here to challenge your thinking process to make sure you regain your mind.\\"    Professor Tolson creates a debate club that goes from school to school testing their wits with the best, but they debate and he writes their opinions, something that teaches these young people to think provocatively, but in essence, the messages are not truly theirs.    While he is a professor during the day, he champions causes at night but organizing sharecroppers and laborers. He is seen as a communist by some, a radical by others and a danger to many by those in power because he is inspiring change.    Among those he selects for the 1935 team we find James Farmer Jr. masterfully played by Denzel Whitaker, Henry, played by Nate Parker and Samantha, the first female to ever join the debate team, beautifully played by Jurnee Smollet.     James is only 14 years old and already in college, the best researcher the team has ever had, eloquent, vivacious and always hopeful and happy. Many experiences chisel away at their beliefs until they find their ownvoice and what a voice it becomes. The debates are inspirational, the struggle to understand simply magnificent, and the real life lessons reveal the trauma experienced by African Americans that grew at a time when lynching a man in Texas was common place.    There are moments of joy but plenty of moments where the viewer is left in shock at the atrocities inflicted by rural whites on African Americans whose only crime was to be different.    One of my favorite moments comes when James Farmer Jr. realizes that there is no hope, they are debating in a world where they are nothing more than \\"negroes\\" in a world that does not accept or welcomes their ideals, and troubled Henry givens him strength again, crying out loud: \\"don't give up James, not you!\\"    They win wherever they debate and Harvard becomes aware of this team and invites them to debate on their campus, and this debate is the ultimate climax to an inspirational film, where they are no longer allowed to say the words prepared by their professor, but told they must prepare their arguments themselves. After a period of rigorous soul-searching they argue from the heart, and while the Harvard team was brilliant, they spoke from the conviction of those who had never lived the reality of the south... Simply magnificent to see a body of highly educated intellectuals rendered silent by truths that were abhorrent but the truth of the south none-the-less.
B000CCBCAS|2.0|I never cared for Four Weddings and a Funeral. Andie MacDowell's character is disgusting, she sleeps aronund, plays with Hugh Grant's character affections and never seems to care about anyone but herself. The only reason I give this film 2 stars instead of 1 because this is Hugh Grant's breakout role and he is so charming in this one, god love him! The rest of the cast is annoying and wooden, if you want an intelligent british comedy then I recommend Bridget Jones's Diary which also has Grant as the romantic lead.

I went on a road trip to the UK...England, Scotland, Wales, spent a few days with them, brought my aunt a copy of 84 Charing Cross Road.  My uncle didn't get the concept, economist that he was.  Letters?  Who wants to read someone else's letters?  Lurch forward about a month. The end of my road trip, both had read and loved this book.

B00133KFGW|5.0|'August Rush' is, as best, hard to describe. It's not a musical, but it's a movie about music, where music forms the emotional backbone of the story. It's not a fantasy, but the story it tells has elements that can only be described as fantastic. It's not a 'family film' is the traditional sense, though it is a movie the the whole family can watch, enjoy, and appreciate on many levels.<br /><br />'August Rush' tells the story of a young boy, conceived on a magical night between a pair of star-crossed lovers who seem to be fated never to meet again, and given up as an orphan at birth. Despite his hard life, the boy has a faith that is challenged at every turn. It is not a faith in a God or gods, not even a faith that his parents will find hom someday. What this boy believes in more than anything is a force that shapes his life and the story he tells us: he believes in music.<br /><br />The boy's faith leads him to a story which is nothing less than magical. It leads him to New York, to discover his own talent for music, to new friends, to people who would use what he brings for their own ends, to those who actually care for him.  His belief and his ability and his determination lead him to hear the music all around him, and to express it in his own way.<br /><br />'August Rush' tells a story that isn't heard very often today, a story of hope and belief and music and the simple ways that magic can be a part of our lives. Like any good fairy tale, 'August Rush' cracks open a door to simple magic and wonder, and invites us to walk through.<br /><br />\\"All you have to do...is listen.\\"
0891419195|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book so much I finished it in less then a week. Parts of it are featured on a PBS documentry called \\"The War\\" (Or somthing like that), anyhow, the book gives all the reader could ask for; loss, comraderie, and the absolute brutality of war. It is my favorite first person account I have read so far, although William Foley's \\"Visions From A Foxhole\\" is exceptional as well. If you were ever curious about a Marine's combat life, read this book, and if you have already read this book, go out and thank a veteran, or current soldier for what they have done for you so that you should never have to experience the horrors of war with your own eyes. Thanks Vets and current men of all wars.To those Marines: SEMPER FI

Are you unsure about taking that leap of faith and beginning your journey to greater self-discovery? If you answered, \\"yes\\" to either question, then please read on because The Alchemist is a book you'll want to sit back and enjoy.<br /><br />The Alchemist has been a best selling self-development fable for twenty years. Brazilian author Paulo Coelho takes both the reader and the main character Santiago on a mystical journey of self-realization. In this novel of self-discovery, we learn that with faith, belief and action dreams really may come true.<br /><br />The Alchemist is a well-written novel that weaves a fascinating tale of a young Spanish Shepard boy who leaves his country, his lively-hood and family in search of hidden treasure.

B00164DWEA|4.0|While Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) searches for an antidote for the gamma poisoning that causes him to Hulk out when overexcited, General Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) dusts off an old super-soldier serum, inadvertently leading to the creation of the Abomination, a creature that may be even more dangerous than the Hulk himself.    While I also enjoyed Ang Lee's earlier, more metaphorical, take on the character, director Louis Leterrier's version is much truer to the spirit of the comics, delivering plenty of Hulk-induced carnage.  I've heard that Marvel Studios insisted on deleting a lot of the more character driven moments to deliver a leaner film, and I recall some intriguing clips from the theatrical trailer that did not appear in the final version.  Hopefully, a director's cut will be released on DVD, because I think the film would have benefited from more of a human dimension.  Nevertheless, I was swept up in the story and had a great time.  Marvel seems to be laying the groundwork for a whole set of interrelated films through the cameo by Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark, passing references to SHIELD and Stark Industries, and the use of the super-soldier serum, which appears to be laying the foundation for a Captain America movie.  (By the way, Farscape's Ben Browder would be ideal for that role, although I'm sure they would prefer to go with a bigger name.)  If Marvel keeps up the quality of their films, there should be quite a bit of anticipation for the Avengers movie that has been promised for a few years from now and would bring many of their characters together.
B0013J30W2|4.0|Full of nonstop action. Sexy. Impossible. WANTED is all these and shamelessly flaunts it. And with good reason: It's a popcorn flick. Summer is upon us and most movie-goers demand a few solid action films, and Wanted delivers.<br /><br />We've seen this plot before. A nobody discovers that he/she is a somebody and develops their \\"abilities\\" thanks to the guidance of a super-dude/dudette. The nobody is cubicle-bound-anxiety-prone-loser Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy, [[ASIN:B0013XZ6X4 Atonement]]). Stuck in a dead-end job he constantly feels overwhelmed by his supervisor and must take anxiety medication to settle himself. Until one day he meets his dudette, the appropriately named Fox (Angelina Jolie, [[ASIN:B000VBB6F6 A Mighty Heart]]), who saves him from the deadly crosshairs of Cross (Thomas Kretschmann, [[ASIN:B00005JO20 King Kong]]), an assassin gone rogue from within a group known as The Fraternity. Told initially by the leader of this group, a man named Sloan (Morgan Freeman, [[ASIN:B000MGUZAM 10 Items or Less]]), that The Fraternity is a group of \\"good\\" assassins who do fates bidding by getting their kill assignments from something known as \\"The Loom of Fate\\", Wesley (McAvoy) enters their ranks in roughshod fashion (being beaten, sliced, healed ...and then beaten and sliced again) to toughen him up for the job he must do.<br /><br />His goal, though, is to kill the man who killed his previously unknown father (Cross being the assassin of Wesley's dad). But if turning a no-account accountant into a killer weren't enough, there's a not-so-subtle twist that many might see coming as they watch this bullet swerving action movie.<br /><br />McAvoy is completely believable as the dweeb-infused office-boy-turned-gunslinger, making the premise of the film a joy. And watching the sexy Angelina Jolie whip out massive handguns and hit her targets nearly without fail is something that'll make your action-packed-weekend fun. She seems so comfortable doing impossible and ridiculous stunts that it makes them seem possible and plausible.<br /><br />For those in the mood for a great shoot `em up, this one's a winner.makes them seem possible and plausible.

0802714544|5.0|Recommended by a Washington Post article, this book does not disappoint.  It starts off with action in Berlin then spins a web of deceit and lies that keep the reader engrossed.  We follow our main character through twists and turns and in different countries.  The climax?  Completely out of left-field.  Shocking.  As I finished the book, I sat and started at the ending for a good five minutes.<br /><br />Buy this book!  A great summer read.  A great weekend read.  Worthy of a space on your bookshelf.

0446402389|5.0|Leo Demidov, war hero in the post-war Stalinist Soviet Union, is an officer of the NKVD the CID of the Red State. Crime was a simple matter in these times. The suspect was inevitably guilty simply because he was suspected. Some crimes, considered bourgeois, officially could not exist in a workers paradise. Among these non-crimes was murder. Demidov is assigned to tell a father his son was not killed but rather the victim of an accident. But doubts continued and in Stalinist Russia doubts were treason. Convinced a serial killer was murdering children, Demidov pushes forward despite the danger.    Demidov is soon a victim of this Alice-in-Wonderland state. When it happens this book quickly becomes a thrilling tale of pursuit and capture. To discuss it further is to dimish the pleasure that awaits the reader.    There  are sure Edgar nominations for Tom Rob Smith from the Mystery Writers of America in two categories-Best First novel and Best Novel. He may well win both awards.

B000O599WG|4.0|This was such a hard film to rate. On one hand you have a Howard Hawkes classic western, starring John Wayne, and with a great supporting cast. And yet, there are a couple of things that do detract from the movie. So after vacillating between 4 and 5 stars, I settled on 4. In reality, I rate it a 4.5.<br /><br />Rio Bravo is the first, and arguably best, of a trio of western films from Hawkes that many say the latter two ([[ASIN:6305754969 El Dorado]] & [[ASIN:B00008CMR6 Rio Lobo]]) were remakes of. While calling those two later films remakes isn't accurate Hawkes did manage to steal many scenes and situations from Rio Bravo to insert into the other two. John Wayne stars as John T. Chance, the town sheriff who has arrested the brother of a wealthy cattle baron, Nathan Burdette, for murder. Burdette has vowed to spring his brother from jail by any means necessary so he's bottled up the town and hired murdering gun hands to be successful. Chance has two deputies as support, a recovering drunk name Dude (Dean Martin) and a crippled old man named Stumpy (Walter Brennan). Along the way he gets help from an old friend named Wheeler (Ward Bond), a young gunslinger named Colorado (Ricky Nelson) who works for Wheeler, and a woman gambler (Angie Dickenson). The situation is already tense as the movie opens then the stakes are raised when Wheeler is gun-downed by one of Burdette's hired killers. What follows is a classic chess match between the sheriff and the cattleman as Burdette gets more & more desperate to free his brother.<br /><br />What makes this film great, besides a great cast, is the pace of the film. Hawkes keeps turning up the tension as Chance and his deputies are forced to retreat into the jailhouse. When you add Dude's detoxified-driven anxiety, Stumpy's stubbornness, and Chance's growing attraction to the woman gambler, known only as \\"Feathers\\", it seems Burdette has them right where he wants them. Things begin to change for the better as Colorado joins the sheriff to avenge his boss' murder.<br /><br />Where I think the movie struggles a little is in the Colorado character. It's obvious that Ricky Nelson was cast to attract the \\"teen\\" crowd. Although he does an OK job portraying the laid-back gunslinger, overall his character becomes a little annoying at the end. And I'm sorry, but the jailhouse scene where Nelson & Martin do a duet on one song and then is joined by Walter Brennan in a second, was so Gene Autry-ish that it really stuck out like a sore thumb. I understand why it's there but I could have done without it. It was just so out of place.<br /><br />But all-in-all it is a great western. Not as good as Hawkes'[[ASIN:6304696612 Red River]] but still a great ride. I would highly recommend it to ANY western fan.e his boss' murder.

So my 2008 goal stated simply \\" I want to be Astonished at This Life, This Opportunity once again.\\"  I was answered, so quickly, so profoundly by  Life itself in the form of Eckhart Tolle and \\"A New Earth\\" and \\"The Power of Now.\\"  To effectively counteract the radical changes we are now experiencing upon the Earth we must change within ourselves.

B00177Y9ZM|2.0|2.5 stars<br /><br />Such a good idea, such a lame movie.<br /><br />Starts pretty well and just gets weaker by the minute. Christensen is simply boring (here and everywhere else I've seen him). He thinks looking seriously and quietly at someone is acting. I feel nothing when I watch this clown.<br /><br />Jackson is becoming a reliable sign of a cheesy flick.<br /><br />The effects here are good, but the plot and story are lazy and should be so much more ingenious considering the basic premise. So much to work with and so little accomplished.<br /><br />Not really worth watching.

0790729350|4.0|They say that Woodstock is coming out on blue-ray in 2009, Fitting I since it will be the 40th Anniversary.  But I do have a question for Warner Bros who own the outakes to the footage of the  1969 concert.      If there's a DVD worth of Jimi Hendrix performances not used in the original documentary but were edited and released to the public, Imagine what other performances exist of bands who performed at the concert.      If you read up on the making of the film, they say original runtime of the \\"first cut\\" of the film was 14 hours.  I'd have to guess that there are more performances sitting in the vault waiting for them to be transfered and conformed to HD and mixed.  It would be nice if they were available for download or it would be great if we could get them on DVD or blu-ray.  There are other considerations that need to be considered.  The artists, the producers of the film, as well as Woodstock Ventures would need to be compensated and that is probably the sticking point for all parties involved including Warners Brothers.      Come on Warners, hire a guy to oversee the release of these outake performances!

And that's what makes the Indy movies FUN.
0143038419|5.0|I just finished this today. July 5 holiday weekend and spent 3 hours this morning reading because I could not put it down. This is the best book I have read in some time. Maybe this isn't for everyone, but I loved it from beginning to end. I have traveled as well, not to all the places she has been, but for me it was the insight into individual personalities, characters, that made it riveting. Yes she is self absorbed. But it is about her journey, so that makes sense. This is not a travelogue book, it is about an inner discovery as a result of mixing with people and experiences outside of her previous exposure to the world. If you are looking for a travelogue, go elsewhere. If you are looking to journey with someone through their highs and lows as they put their life back together and discover a world beyond themself, this is for you. I loved the characters. I loved the settings. I loved the entire book and hated when it ended. I don't know if this is great literature. But I think those who criticize this book are people who just don't get what she is talking about. Which is fine, but don't neccesarily judge it by them. If you have been through the feelings she has been through, you will relate to it, and it will have meaning to you. This is a great book for any woman who has ever allowed herself to become invisible because of a man they were with, and now wants to discover who she is on her own.
B000UYX5AI|5.0|I'm usually not one to try something out just because the critics liked it, but when I heard the praise this album was getting, my interest was peaked. I got the album, and fell in love. As a seasoned music lover, I wondered how I had never looked into this underrated band.     I listened to the album over and over, never growing tired of it, and each time I was struck by its quality. It was very melodic, with a keen sense of harmony as well, the lyrics were interesting, and each of the band's members had impressive skill on their respective instruments. Each song was distinct and well-written, and everytime I listened to the album, I was left stunned.     I've listened to most of the band's other material since then, and there's some great stuff - truly a fantastic band - but still, this album moves me every time, and I still think it's their best-written, musically speaking.    I know some Biffy Clyro fans are miffed because it's been successful (as if that's a bad thing), or because it's attracted new fans (again, is that a bad thing?), or because it they think it sounds more mainstream (which can be contested). Of course, one of the other reviews even complained that critics liked it too much. These fans need to lighten up and look at the big picture. All good bands progress and go into new territory from time to time, and that's what Biffy Clyro's doing, and, if you ask me, they're going into exciting new directions.
0061537934|5.0|Dogs, Race Car Driving, and a beautiful philosophy of life.  This book has it all.  I could not put it down and had to read it in two days even though I had a million other things to do.  I admit to being a dog lover, but I'm certainly not interested in race car driving.  Nevertheless, this book will make a dog lover out of a non-dog person and race car enthusiast out of a couch potato with no interest in cars at all.  But most important, this book has heart and a compelling plot.  Highly recommended.
B000J103PC|2.0|This is the heart-chilling story of an intelligent young woman with a lot of potential--if a somewhat tenuous grasp on her own identity--who, through the course of the movie, has everything that was interesting or endearing stripped from her by an unfortunate expedition into a superfluous industry.    This, in and of itself, would not be so bad except for the fact that the viewer is supposed to feel good for her by the end. This movie would have made a great tragedy.  It could have been a fantastic commentary about how many young college graduates, thrust into the real world without an adequate transition period, become the prey of a business world that eschews substance in favor of form, and are forced to take on scripted roles that crush the individual potential they once had. Instead, this movie celebrates this process, and for that it is saddening.    The script, on top of its depressing advocacy of modern materialism, was banal. From watching to the ten minute mark, just about anyone will be able to predict the denouement. It is utterly uncompelling as a story, and offers no memorable insights. The one mark in its favor is that the acting is good. The two leads do an impressive job with the sub-par material from which they had to work.    Overall, however, the cringe-worthy message and the hackneyed storyline make this a downright bad movie. It was painful to watch, because I liked Hathaway's character at the beginning of the movie, and I was insulted that I was supposed to applaud the descent into shallowness and frivolity and exposed the weakness of her character.
B0018QCXGY|4.0|For a movie that was supposed to be seen once, the blu-ray was great, picture sound and every thing, I have to admit being able to go back and catch the things i missed in the theater was great! The extras provide more insight to the story. I would definitely recommend this to others of the big monster genre!
B000VNMMQQ|4.0|If you loved the three installments of the Die Hard series then this one made after 12 years after third will not disappoint. The action is top notch without using too many computer aided tricks. The only big drawback was the villain. The Die Hard franchise is known for its villains but this one truly disappoints. Scenes where rage, clenched fists and teeth are expected are passed off peacefully without any reaction. It looked very poorly handled. However when the villain is dispatched you are left wondering what a waste of talent (of the character in the movie). Hacker's equipment was also fascinating. I would love to have one of those folding keyboards. Bruce Willis is older but he never compromises on the action. If not for the villain's acting Live Free or Die Hard deserves 5 stars.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I watched the complete series first - loved the characters, stories, everything. Then watched the movie - Serenity. The film was great in tying up all the loose ends and can definitly stand on its own as a film. You don't have to see the series to enjoy this gem of a sci-fi film. Excellent movie! A must see !
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a really demanding workout especially if you have not been doing any exercise for a long time. You huff and puff by the time you reach 7 minutes. You will sweat and you will burn fat. The workout does not give you time to catch your breath. You have 5 secs of rest and you need to get back to working out. It isn't 20 minutes it is like 25 minutes for level 1, 28 minutes level 2. I have the SWAT workout too but I don't want to end up looking like a bulked up guy so, I chose to use Jillian's workout. Rest one day and then get back to working out. During your rest day, do pilates or yoga so that your body does not completely rest.

B00005JPS8|5.0|I liked Robert Downey, Jr. in Air America. After that, he went semi-ballistic with his substance abuse problems, and I didn't like Robert Downey, Jr. anymore.  I've been an Iron Man fan, off-and-on, since Shell Head popped up in Marvel's pantheon, back in the Sixties and got a chest full of shrapnel in 'Nam.  I NEVER thought Downey-the-dope-freak could be Tony Stark, the heroic heart attack in an Iron vest, fighting for the American way.  All I can say is, MAN! Was I Ever WRONG?? Oh, YEAH!! Big Time WRONG.  Well whaddaya know? It Works! Robert Downey, Jr. can drop the Junior part whenever he decides to, because he's playing in the Big Leagues again! This one is Out Of The Park; Downey, Bridges, Howard, Paltrow - ALL the main cast did an EXCELLENT JOB.  And, just in case there's anyone still out there who HASN'T seen it but wants to, I'll shut up now. Go spend the money for the theater, then spend it again for the DVD (Get the Blu-Ray if you've got the machine for it), and ENJOY!
B0018OAPAW|5.0|There are many different ways to begin to review a CD but, for some reason, I can't get past one single word running through my head when I think of \\"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\\": epic.    As I'm sitting and typing at this moment I've come to realize what makes me come to that word. Have you ever heard a song that connected to your emotions so accurately and your feeling at that moment so perfectly that you thought 'I knew I was going to hear this song some day'? The songs \\"Hammerhead\\" and \\"You're Gonna Go Far, Kid\\" are did that to me. They're the type of songs that you want to sing loudly along with while driving down the interstate with the windows down. Well, at least I do.    Another stand out song for me is \\"Stuff Is So Messed Up\\". The song takes an amusing approach at stating several truths about the our current state and I was pleasantly surprised when I heard it the first time.    I'm no expert in music. At the moment I only own about 50 CDs compared to the hardcore music fanatics whose collections reach the hundreds. I couldn't give you any information on them beyond the group and the names of the songs either, where others know such trivial information as the names of every grandmother of the members of every band they have a CD of (or something equally ridiculous). However I know what kind of music I like and this CD definitely has it.    On a side note, I thought the inside cover artwork for this CD was perfect for the sound of it all.
B000LT2IHI|3.0|I read the previous reviews about how difficult this product was to use but had a friend that had one and their infant loved it.  I bought it anyway and had no problems with having our 10 month old use it as well as being able to get the balls in to the giraffe's mouth without any problems.  As my son has grown though, there is a tipping issu with the toy.  Our son is 20 lbs and if he leans in the right direction it will go over with him so don't expect it to hold up your child.

My 8 year old is also dyslexic and I think having a hero with a learning disability is empowering to him.    We're starting Book 3 this week, but so far the series has been really engaging and always leaves the kids asking for more!  And to be honest, I want to read it every night as well.  There's excitement, mystery, suspense, attempted murder, and even a bit of a crush woven in there...what's not to love?
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|I waited a couple of weeks to review this album, because it really requires of a bit of time to sink in.  Coldplay has always been a little artsy, but the band's previous two albums were much more pop-oriented than this one. I've always been impressed with Coldplay's ability to evolve on each album, and on \\"Viva La Vida\\" I think they've done it more than ever before.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Life In Technicolor,\\" and it's an immediate breath of fresh air with all the different sounds going on. I really love this track, but sadly it's merely an intro without any vocals and it's over in about 2 minutes. It's still a great song, I just wish it lasted longer and had some singing. Then we have \\"Cemeteries Of London,\\" which is kind of a spacey and melancholy song. I didn't think much of it at first, but now I really like it. \\"Lost\\" is a pretty basic tune, but something about the percussion fires it up in just the right way to make it really grab you. \\"42\\" is great because of all the tempo-changes. It begins slow and quiet with singing and a piano, and sounds an awful lot like something from the Parachutes album. Then it picks up slightly towards the middle, and by the end of the song it takes on an incredibly catchy and much quicker beat. \\"Yes\\" is an ok song, but it's really the unlisted song after it (Chinese Sleep Chant) that stood out as a highlight on the album. \\"Viva La Vida\\" (the song) is the same song that was heard in television commercials for the album, and it stands out as sounding the most like their previous material. Still, like the rest of the album, this song has a few non-traditional tricks up it's sleeve. It doesn't feature any obvious guitar or piano, it's mostly an orchestral arrangement and a couple of other instruments I'm not even familiar with. The album's first single, \\"Violet Hill,\\" features dark pounding drums and a slightly gloomy piano. It's kind of a strange choice for a single, but it's ability to get stuck in your head makes sense. I have to say that every song on here is quite good, but I feel the album ends a little prematurely, even with 2 unlisted songs thrown into the middle of the album.  But this album is all about experimenting and breaking new ground, and unlike past Coldplay albums, it seems to focus more on instrumentation than singing. It's definitely one of the best of 2008 so far!to say that every song on here is quite good, but I feel the album ends a little prematurely, even with 2 unlisted songs thrown into the middle of the album.

B000J0NIIW|4.0|I've read some pretty bad reviews on its battery charge holding power, but was intrigued anyway enough to buy one.  I LOVE it!!  Enough so, that I want to give you these cautions, which I'm observing.  Then I'll tell you why it's worth it.    1.  It says to fully charge it (8 hours) when you first get it.  Do that.  Don't cheat halfway through because you want to try it out. Just leave it plugged in, uninterrupted, for the 8 hours.   2.  All rechargeable batteries have some weaknesses.  This one may have more.  While the directions say you can re-charge it before it runs out, I am not doing that.  The safest way to treat a rechargeable battery is to let it run out of juice entirely.  Then give it a full charge.  That prevents any possibility of the battery's \\"memory\\" programming itself to only hold a charge a shorter time.  3.  Do NOT leave the battery in the charger for longer than 24 hours, and I wouldn't leave it anywhere near that.  (They tell you that in the instructions but they don't say why, so people can ignore this.)  What happens is... the item gets fully charged (in this case, in 8 hours or less).  Then as is the case with ALL batteries, they lose a little charge just by existing.  If a rechargeable battery is left in its charger, the charger may charge it that teensy bit to bring it up to snuff.  So what you are doing is conditioning its memory for a short charge.  (I've heard this from everyone, from Verizon with cell phones on down the line.)  4.  Last but not least, because of that last factor, I keep the battery out of the machine.  It could still be losing a little charge, but at least it's not plugged into anything.    As for other complaints I've read, just understand how this thing works.  It is NOT a vacuum.  There is no suction whatsoever.  It is nothing more than a sweeper.  It has round brush rows on all sides that sweep matter into a tray (and it's a little tray).  And that's all that it does.  HOWEVER, it does that so well that... well, let's just say my floors are cleaner than they've ever been.  I run this thing around maybe once a day, and it's just great.  I empty the little tray (which is extremely easy to detach and re-attach as the head of the unit is on the floor -- you don't have to pick the unit up and hold it over the trash).  Then it just snaps back on with a good, confirming click.  And I would plan on emptying the tray every time you use it, because this thing picks up dust and everything.    One other thing.  From time to time clean the brushes.  Threads can get wound around and while they are just not a problem to pull off, you don't want them getting too wound up.  It's just not a biggie at all.     So in short, yes there are a few things to remember, but this little unit is SO incredibly handy, that none of the above things are worth hassling  yourself over.  As for it working on carpets, it does okay on short pile carpet (you will hear the motor slow down a little).  But it's meant mainly for floors.    I also love the fact that it has a magnet on one side of the head and on the handle (which matches up and holds) because it stores in the teensiest width places.    So this is a big review FOR it, but with the cautions that you can't expect it to be a vacuum because it's not; and you do need to do whatever you can to maximize its battery life between charges.  As for customer service, I don't think there is any.  I called them to get the lowdown on how to maximize its battery life between charges, and it's nothing more than a call center.  It's not the actual company.    I just absolutly love this thing.  I track dirt in from the barn and from the outside, and it is soooo handy for daily maintenance of floors (kitchen, bathroom, etc.)  I haven't vacuumed my kitchen floor for over a month (ouch! but it's true).  I just run this thing around and it gets into all sorts of crevices and corners.      Oh, one other caution.  I am VERY careful not to run it over water or other spills (particularly anything sticky!).  The reason is because those brushes are obviously going to have dirt encounters, that's what they're for.  Any liquid, I'm quite sure, would just make for gunking them up.    I hope this is helpful, because the reviews I've read would have dissuaded me from having ever tried it.  But they were ALL complaints about the above things which are quite easy to avoid.
B000001ES9|4.0|This might not serve as a great review for this album, as I really just call people out for telling me I should stay away from buying it.  It just shows me that half of the people who have an opinion on music don't have a clue.  They told me the same thing about Led Zeppelin's Prescence album, and that has become one of my favorites!  They told me I wouldn't like Pink Floyd's Animals.. I love it!  I think Dark Side of the Moon sounds weak and lazy!  They said (when I was getting into Maiden) to wait to buy Killers and try something else first.  Wrong!  I am a little upset, and I want to talk about it.      I just picked this album up the other day after thinking about the song \\"Working Man\\".  No matter how much I explore Rush's other work, in the end, I always go back and listen to this song.  I like it more than any other Rush song I've heard, and it's a totally different sound than anything else from any other Rush album.  I really wanted to hear more of this sound.... and it is awesome.    First of all, stop comparing it to their other albums because that is where you start to sound foolish.  This is hardly even the same band as their later work.  This album is a straight up rocker and when looked at by itself, it really shines.  The bass is thick, the guitar tone is exciting, the drums rock, and the lyrics are about getting lit.  It has everything that makes a great listening experience.    The second thing that makes me upset is how people percieve John Rutsy.  The mentality is like \\"he was no Peart, but he did his best.\\"  They say everything short of calling him total garbage.  He is great on this record and that is compared to any pro drummer.  I am going to say it now, after listening to this album, I think Peart kinda ruined Rush!  He blew it!  They had a great thing going with this debut record and you can only imagine where it would have grown from there had Peart's influence not come about.  I can't listen to later Rush the same way after listening to this record. Now that I think about it... if you are anything like me you SHOULD stay away from this album!  It will destroy your entire perception of the band.
B0018AK9RA|2.0|Allow me to throw up once again.  The last album \\"Angel...\\" was pretty sweet, save for the lame-o ballad that was just horrendous and the Loch Ness song which was written by a child.  This new album is so BORING!!!  I don't see how Priest fans can embrace it as a good cd.  It made me mad!  Priest is an 8-10 song type of band and anything more will start to get repetitive and boring.  So what do they do?  Make a double cd with the most over played and over done subject of them all: Nostradamus.  Who cares anymore?  Almost every band has done it!  It's like a death metal band saying \\"hey, let's write about death!\\"  Priest is a good heavy metal band but they cannot stretch their talent that far as to make a double cd and actually make a story like Nostradamus interseting.  It's about as intriguing as piss in the wind.  I mean, no Painkiller or Blood Stained-like tunes?  I love that Halford is back and all but maybe they needed the youth of Ripper to make sweet and heavy songs!  I dunno, I'm not too happy with this.  It sounds like old men metal.

The \\"Say You Will\\" album is like Tusk minus La McVie.

B0013FSL3E|4.0|WALL-E is truly a stunning achievement.  Any movie that captivates my 3 year old, enchants my 11 year old, and entertains my husband and me is a rare and real triumph.  WALL-E is without question one of the best family films of the year to date.<br /><br />Pixar has outdone themselves with this film.  The animation is truly lovely; the story is sweet and touching; the characters are vivid, engaging, and very believable; and the soundtrack is superb.  I start laughing out loud the moment I heard the first notes from the songs of Hello, Dolly (much to the chagrin of my 11 year old), and the giggles continued on for the rest of the film.  Basing the entire plot on two songs from a well-loved movie musical was a bold and brilliant move by the creators of this film, and the idea certainly caught my fancy.  As an added bonus, the tribute to the HAL 9000 and the accompanying 2001 underscore had me rolling in the aisles.  Very clever!<br /><br />The story of WALL-E is told in great depth and detail with very minimal dialog.  Using beeps, gestures, and yes, even expressions, this charming robotic romance comes to life before our eyes.  Who needs words?  My three year old certainly did not.  This was her first adventure to the movie theater, and I was a bit concerned that the lack of dialog would be an issue, but she was absolutely enthralled.  When EVE finally started to respond to WALL-E, she whispered to me \\"Look, Mommy, they're friends now.\\"  When EVE \\"got sick\\" (my daughter's words), she told me \\"Mommy, WALL-E is taking care of EVE.\\"  Later in the film, she cried out \\"EVE, EVE, you have to save WALL-E.\\"  She really got it, every bit.<br /><br />Now, I do have to say that \\"save the earth from the ravages of evil mankind\\" propaganda really has no place in a children's movie (and thus it loses a star), but fortunately it only minimally detracts from the robots' touching love story and their \\"directive\\" to save humanity and return them to Earth.  WALL-E is a cute, funny, romantic film, just right for the entire family.  Highly recommended.for the entire family.  Highly recommended.

B00000JGOH|2.0|What is interesting about this portrayal of William Shakespeare is that the historical figure was actually descended from the Saxon Earls of Warwick (and from the famous West Saxon royal dynasty which included Alfred the Great, Edward the Elder and Athelstan the Glorious).  Shakespeare's mother was a de Arden, after all, and the heiress of the hereditary family estate called Kingsbury [Saxon for: 'King's Borough'], which shows the family's close connection to the Saxon seat of royal authority in Wessex.<br /><br />William the Conqueror earned the sobriquet of 'Willie the Bastard' by, among other things, disenfranchising his supporters such as the (Saxon) de Warwicks and enfranchising native Norman families such as the Newburghs in their place. [Note: the replacement of the de Warwicks did not, in point of fact, occur until after the Rebellion of 1088 under William Rufus, 22 years after the Conquest].  While this had the effect of buying off temporarily William I & II's competition, it produced trauma in the families displaced from major nobility earned over 500 years in the Saxon hierarchy.  Shakespeare was just one example of a princely line now converted to minor nobility and having to \\"sing for its supper\\" after being displaced from hereditary landholdings.  On the other hand, it is arguable whether there ever would have been a Shakespeare if he had been personally taken up with managing the great estate of his forefathers; he would have had no time or perhaps would have developed no interest in writing.<br /><br />Hence, it is surely at least ironic that the movie has him competing with the now Norman \\"Lord Wessex\\", pitting his Saxon pedigree against a Norman rival of appointed, but of in fact inferior rank.  I wonder if the writers of the screenplay comprehended the irony (and implausibility) in this fictional rendition?  Furthermore, it must be noted that the Oxfordian theory of authorship is abundantly disproven once Shakespeare's royal heritage is revealed.  Shakespeare had ample evidence from his own lineage about how court intrigue played out and thus, did not need secondary sources or a ghost writer for assistance.Shakespeare had ample evidence from his own lineage about how court intrigue played out and thus, did not need secondary sources or a ghost writer for assistance.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|Excellent movie with an excellent leading man. Daniel Day-Lewis definitely proved he deserved the Oscar he won for his role as Daniel Plainview. He did such an amazing job with his performance...I mean everything right down to the movement of his mouth and the twinges and ticks and squinting, everything! Paul Dano did well as Eli Sunday, and he was so creepy and perfect for his part. Ciaran Hinds also has a supporting role, and I was so happy to see him again. He's one of my favorite actors. The movie wasn't slow-going, but it was slow in the beginning. It spanned several years in the early 20th century when everyone was on the quest for oil. I liked the story of the two main characters striving for wealth and power by the same means but for two very different goals. It was interesting to watch this movie develop and \\"finish\\"... I know the ending was kind of sickening, but I liked it and thought it was actually kind of funny. The ending really made the movie for me.

B0012QE4Q2|3.0|I thought this movie was a somewhat decent representation of the book. It was hard to dislike King Henry so much this time around since he was played by Eric Bana (whew!). The story was kind of summed up in parts with quick scene changes and long periods of time going by in just minutes. I didn't like that, but you can only do so much with a couple hours for a movie. My one gripe about this film is that the ending concerning Anne and George's relationship and what they did and what happened as a result of it was changed so that we're only led to believe that it may have happened. You don't find anything out for sure, and you don't get as twisted and dramatic an ending as you do in the book. The ending was still dramatic, but I think they should have left it alone. Still, it was a good flick....the love scenes could have been longer or more intense (hehe), but they were satisfactory, too. ;o)

B0015WJBR0|5.0|Moon Safari's double CD follow up to the incredible \\"Doorway to Summer\\" is more of the same -- which is to say amazing, fantastic, spectacular, etc.   This symphonic prog-rock masterpiece, filled with gorgeous harmonies and gleefully anticipated crescendos, engenders euphoric chills of joy.
0316789798|5.0|I had this book as a kid and loved it - no written instructions, just step by step pictures that are easy to follow.  My 11-yr old and 7-yr old both like it.  The final pictures are full of character and are really fun.  This may not be a book for a kid who's really serious about drawing, but it's great fun for the average artist, adults included.
B0019IB26I|3.0|It is altogether disappointing and discouraging that such a talented songwriter stoops to such a low level to sell a live album.<br /><br />Two words, people. Auto-tune.<br /><br />Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of a live album, if it's not even actually a fully live recording?<br /><br />This saddens me, John, You're gifted, man. Might I encourage you to cut down on the weed and step up the practicing instead of sprinkling some \\"studio magic\\" over everything you record so you don't have to work too hard.<br /><br />As great as it may sound, this album leaves me with a deceived feeling. Come on, John- You're better than this.
B0013J30W2|4.0|If you're looking for a good summer block buster type movie to watch,<br />this isn't a bad place to start for 2008's season. The movie never<br />takes itself too seriously, but is more of an action/thriller than a<br />comedy. It sort of reminds me of The Matrix injected with heavy<br />elements of Fight Club and Office Space, if that makes any sense. The<br />action sequences are amazingly directed, the cast works and most of the<br />jokes are funny. It speaks volumes that this film was directed by the same guy that did Night Watch and Day Watch, which are personal favorites. Wanted keeps up with that level of intensity. There are a few goofy, awkward moments, but overall, the film keeps you on the edge of your seat.
0060853980|5.0|The quick wit, wry humor and awesome imagery of this book push it quickly into one of the most fun and imaginative out there. One understands the characters' behavior intimately and enjoys the roller coaster ride of a story while hilarious and ominous events constantly unfold.<br /><br />I think my favorite part of the book is the representation of specific English accents and slang -- the reproductions in my head were enough to make me chuckle on more than one occasion. I don't think anyone with a sense of humor could avoid enjoying this book.
0800141660|5.0|This is a typical Jane Austen romance, beautifully written and masterfully performed.  The witty dialogue is well casted and acted by charming and professional perfomers.  Highly recommended, especially for Jane Austen fans.
B000YABYLA|2.0|Maybe it was all the hype, all the buildup...but when I finally sat down to watch Juno, I have to say I was decidedly unimpressed.  Was I supposed to find a message in the movie?  What was this message?  I found the acting...OK, the storyline....eh.
072325804X|5.0|I bought this for my 14 year old niece. She has a slight reading problem, as some kids do and this book has helped her to want to learn to read more then prior to receiving it.  Outstanding for family read alongs.
B000XA5K48|5.0|Wow, I thought this looked good after the previews, but I bought it and have already watched it several times.  While sometimes unbelievable action, Clive Owen looks great doing it.  Not tons of dialouge but what there is, is witty and appropriate.  Great sex scene.  Hope you enjoy.
0553582461|4.0|Because her presence sure ruined the ending of this epic saga. For me, anyway.  Having just finished this incredible series, I'm left feeling dumbfounded at how Robin Hobb totally blew the ending. To call it `bittersweet' or `anticlimax' is only to paint part of the picture. If only Molly had died earlier, in childbirth or had some kind of accident. . . the ending would probably have been much better.      Just to recap: Molly was stated over and over again to be only a youthful love of Fitz's, And that she had finally discovered true love with a MAN, Burrich, almost twenty years ago. Someone who could take care of her and give her a horde of children. For crying out loud, she wasn't even that developed a character. I chiefly remember her from the first series as alternating between crying and frowning while stamping her foot and arching her back in ecstasy while she dug her fingernails into Fitz back during lovemaking. Not a whole lot else there really.    Spoilers ahead!    What Fitz got at the end, was hollow and meaningless, even if it was `happy'.   I have a feeling the author chickened out a bit near the end of this story, and all of the groundwork laid for the identity of the Fool was just thrown out because she either couldn't or didn't want to deal with it.    The Fool was supposed to be a woman. Period. The books had so many hints!  First, Starling called it back in book 3, and it was so obvious after that, it made more and more sense as the saga went on. The dream with the Rooster Crown in which a WOMAN with the Fool's voice led some kind of festival. That vision was the first `warning' to Fitz that the Fool was totally different than what he visualized. Then, the story of their relationship in the Tawny Man became about Fitz not seeing the truth on purpose and the complexity of their relationship with the sexual tension building and nether one admitting the truth to the other. Other hints:    The fact the Fool never let him see him undressed.  The fact the Fool covered his chest when showing Fitz his tattoo.  When Jinna the hedge witch read Fitz's palm and said that his true love had been there in and out of his life for many years, and would come back to him at the end. I thought it was the Fool, it made sense.  Molly was absent for almost 20 years.   The female visitor from the Trader's town who told Fitz point blank that he was a moron and not seeing `Amber' as she truly was.  The fact the all White Prophets and their Catalysts are male/female pairings.  The list goes on.  The Fool was woven in and out of his life and did come back to him. He was even named `Beloved' !  Instead, Fitz had to go back to Molly in a somewhat painful fashion. I literally cringed while reading the entire nauseating last 20 pages of the book. Ugh.     It was a horrible clichéd ending to have given the readers, after the wonderful originality of the series and did not feel right, but forced. Come on, am I supposed to believe that Fitz pined for the memory of someone that basically either cried or b--tched at him for their entire teenage relationship? In between great love sessions, of course.  And upon renewing their acquaintance, she isn't much changed except that she becomes a grandmother with more `womanly curves' while Fitz tries to woo her sorry a-s back to him. Also, they both just kind of sail past the complexity of Burrich in the mix and get over his death with almost painful relief. Burrich deserved better.  Fitz ends up kind of pathetic, really. What was so great about Molly was the nostalgic memory of her he had. The tripe about the Fool buying his memories back from Girl on a Dragon is a cop out to explain why a nearly 40 year old man never grew up in terms of romance.    I liked him with the Fool better.    Hobb built up a complex relationship and it was brushed out by `accident' that's very contrived, just like Burrich's convenient death so Fitz can finally have Molly. And frankly, at the end she's just not worth having.Other points: Final reunions with people who thought him dead were glossed over. He and Burrich had so much to say to one another . . .  this never really happened. The reunion with Patience was a little better, but the feeling of hurry begins to be more obvious at this point in the book.   I wonder if Robin Hobb was truly happy with the ending upon later reflection. If she was rushed, well - it shows. Too many pat and easy answers. Until the last half of this book, the entire saga was a masterpiece. But bringing Fool back to life only to have him walk away without saying goodbye was terrible and not at all what was so painstakingly laid out in the last 6 books.    All so Fitz could finally bag Molly after she sucked a bee stinger out of his ear. After 16 years. (not making this up)    And they lived happily ever after.    The End.    (I hope not!)
1591841666|4.0|This book may initially look like your average typical \\"Never Give Up\\" material. But Seth Godin, in his better-than-average ways, has produced something which is both original and worthy of serious attention (especially in a world obsessed with success and never-quitting).    Firstly, one must never give up, yes. But this attitude is critical only for those skills/ideas/products you have which make you the best in the world (the 'world' meaning which community/market you're a part of and necessarily all the continents if you know what I mean).    Secondly, for anyone who wishes to achieve anything spectacular, there will always be a period of dryness, lethargy, costs exceeding benefits, (apparent) failure which one has to go through i.e. there will be a Dip.    Push through this and you'll come on the other 'end' of the loop a winner. What's important - and thank God(in) for the reminder - is that we must ANTICIPATE and PLAN for the Dip.    Another famous speaker who mentioned something which sounds like a Dip is Randy Pausch who said that:    \\"The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out; the brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. The brick walls are there to stop the people who don't want it badly enough. They are there to stop the other people!\\"    Where Godin differs would be in two things:    1. The brick walls can be overcome if you're the best at what you do (this is when you must STICK)    2. The brick walls should be accepted and left behind if not (this is when you must QUIT)    Which brings us to his third point, the one that raises the most eyebrows surely: You must recognise there are times one must stop or, better yet, not even start a project.     Why? Because if you're not the best and there's no chance you will be, pushing through the Dip only creates discouragement and takes away time you should be putting into that which you can be world-class in.    To stick? Or to quit? That he even raises the second question puts Godin in the top 1% of the world's best thinkers and advisers. That it's okay and even commendable to quit is an almost-never-asked question which is more than way overdue.    This is not a how-to book. It's a why-not manual, a look-here work, an always-remember guide. It's also one the best (if somewhat subversive) \\"motivational\\" books around, one which nobody who's ever thought long and hard about irreversible (or hard-to-reverse) decisions related to careers and business can afford to miss.    Best thing is: It's a short book. No way you'll quit on this one.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|I really thought that was a CD for my teenagers but I was wrong it does have catchy fast paced songs but Take A Bow *** We can all relate to
B000003TA4|5.0|OK, so I have set myself the task of reviewing the second most overrated albums of the 90's (the first being OK Computer) whilst trying not to offend anyone and also trying to be fair.  It has been quite some time since I have listened to Nevermind all the way through.  Back in the day I listened to it endlessly and loved it.  It is a great album, certainly a very important album, maybe the most important of the 90's.  However, it is also a very `cool' album.  Many people give this top marks without thinking about it because it's cool to like Nirvana isn't it?  Cobain was such a tortured genius wasn't he?  My friends will think less of me if I don't like this album won't they?    I personally am not bothered about what is cool, what is not, about being pretentious etc.  If I like something then I like it, not because I'm expected to like it.  The same goes for if I dislike something.    Having said all that, I really enjoy this album.  It is a very solid piece of work; there are no problems at all with running through this from beginning to end, each song ranges from good to great and the power and energy runs throughout.  Add that to the nostalgia I feel, remembering listening to it as an 11 year old, then a few years later when everyone started listening again after Cobain's death, then it surpasses being just an album; it becomes part of my coming of age.    Smells Like Teen Spirit- Straight off the bat we get a cool riff and then BAM, the power hits us.  Like the album, this track is overrated and overplayed.  We shouldn't let this detract from the fact that it is still a fantastic anthem, which the so-called Generation X embraced.  A very powerful opener for an album, everybody's attention was grabbed and all eyes were on Seattle.    In Bloom- This next track is as every bit as good as Teen Spirit.  Cobain's guttural vocals, a big fat baseline and a great solo combine to bring us a superb song that sometimes gets forgotten, wedged between two better known titles.    Come As You Are- Featuring some of the best lyrics on the album and a hugely famous intro, Come As You Are is only second to Teen Spirit when it comes to popularity and fame amongst the Nirvana catalogue.  For me this is the best track on the album, Nirvana's best song in fact.  Absolutely incredible.    Breed- Grohl's drums propel Breed throughout the next three minutes.  Cobain is great on vocals, the lyrics are once again very good and a middle eight that loses none of the songs fire and tempo.    Lithium- `I'm so happy cos today I've found my friends, they're in my head.  I'm so ugly, that's ok cos so are you' are my favourite lyrics from the album.  The chorus is the very essence of the grunge movement.  One of the best crafted songs on Nevermind.    Polly- Not as innocent as it first sounds, this acoustic track has darker undertones.  A slight change in mood here as we have a softer song with no loud moments, just Kurt, his guitar and minimal background.    Territorial Pissings- Pure energy is the only way to describe this song.  The drums, guitar and vocals all strain together to give this odd and almost novelty song a brute force that almost smashes it's way through the speakers.    Drain You- Another underrated track on an album with so many highlights.  The balance between all elements is spot on, including the brilliant lyrics.    Lounge Act- The intro starts with a big fat meaty bass line and then the track develops quite an upbeat tempo.  The vocals show off both sides of Kurt's abilities; in the first half we get his singing voice which is low and rough, then in the second half we get his scream and yell which makes his voice even more gravelly.  His voice IS grunge.    Stay Away- `Rather be dead than cool' perhaps the most fitting and revealing lyrics that Kurt Cobain penned.  A good solid track with brilliant drumming by Dave Grohl.    On A Plain- One of my favourite nirvana songs; everything about it, once again, fits together just right.  I just love the way the lyrics kick in at the start.    Something In The Way- We started off with a heavy anthem but know we end the album on a quiet note.  This is even more laid back than Polly and it is so much better.  A very simple tune with a very simple yet beautiful harmony on the chorus, this is the most understated track on the album and, hence, the most underrated.    There is a hidden track called `Endless, Nameless'.  It doesn't really fit with the rest of the album and isn't a great track, however there is some good musicianship going on and a few good melodies intertwined with the rawness of the singing.
B00009AOBI|3.0|This is a great movie but it was ruined for me when the music was changed from bob segers to bruce springsteens, springsteens music is not as good a match to the film as bob segers was.i will be selling this special version and getting the original.
B000006TRV|4.0|It's \\"The Wall\\"--- needed it on CD, Roger Waters tells all biography. If you haven't heard it-----your parents have. Or maybe the worms ate into your brain. Either way----- you love it or hate it on this one---- I love it.
B0007Q6PBK|4.0|This production was filmed live at the met in 1977 and it's an affecting one.  I had seen Renata Scotto perform as Musetta in another production with Carreras and that performance was quite memorable so i really looked forward to seeing her as Mimi.  Scotto performs from the soul and from the heart and it's a very moving experience to hear and see her perform.  Her singing is so poetic with such sensitive artful display of dynamics to convey the words she is singing.  This is a performance not about ego but about art.  There's a moment in the final scene when she's in bed and everybody has left and she slowly rises with such fragile strain out of the bed to stand and it's simply heartbreaking.  Bravo Ms. Scotto.  You bring tears to my eyes.  Pavarotti starts the opera concentrating mainly on vocal technical delivery then starts to assert himself emotionally in the part.  The golden tone and technique is there in full display and he does an admirable job at acting as well.  I don't think that he's the most artful of tenors and what i mean by that is that he could add more meaning to the text by phrasing more and using a wider array of dynanics more often.  If you listen and watch Scotto's portrayel then you can clearly see the difference in levals of artistry.  This takes nothing away from the great tone and technique that he had but merely states that the performance though very fine could be improved upon musically and dramatic wise.   See Carlo Bergonzi who may not have the golden tone of Pavarotti or the power to hit high c's like pavarotti but made up for that with a more complete artistic delivery of their character.  The rest of the cast is fine even though Marcello (Wixell) is somewhat bland in his portrayel and could use a little more expressiveness acting and vocal wise and Musetta (Niska) could have been more bombastic especially in the scene at the restaurant.   The stage production is pleasing to the eye though not as extravagant as something produced bysay Franco Zeffirelli.     These are just a few criticisms on a performance that is very satisfying on the whole with a restored picture that is slightly grainy but totally acceptable.  The crowd is a most loving crowd as they go nuts at the end of musetta's waltz as well as most of the highlights.  So if you're looking for a dvd Boheme then this quality production will do the trick but be prepared to cry as you experience the grand artistry of Renata Scotto.  Truly the queen of the night.

630542828X|4.0|As a former resident of the Greater Boston area this was a film that evoked memories on a number of levels.  The investigations of cancer clusters and their relationship to EPA Super Fund Sites is still something that should be coordinated.  Moving film with solid performances.The follow up to the story is perhaps more hopeful.  The sites have been cleaned and are being utilized!  Despite the irepairable damage done to these families America can heal itself via the tenacious actions of its citizen/victims and the scar tissue shoud be a reminder as to the dangerous and destructive nature of unmonitored business interests.
0790729350|2.0|Read the other reviews.    I bought the VHS to see if it was better than the DVD. It is! Better video AND sound quality. Warner Home Video did a poor job on the DVD version. It is NOT truly widescreen (as you will see if you buy the VHS). It is more pan-and-scan full screen. You WILL get a better movie by buying the VHS and copying it to DVD.
0385338724|5.0|The idea behind this book is thought provoking - Ladies, what would you do if you suddenly woke up in the hospital to find out that not only have you no memory of the last three years of your life, but that everything that you do remember has completely changed?  This would include your appearance (for the Better!), your career (you've been Promoted!), your love life (You're Married!! & to a really good-looking guy), your lifestyle (Fantastic! Your husband is rich and you make three times as much as you used to) and that your social life has changed too.  Well, maybe not everything new is better - you seem to have all new friends but your old friends; the one's that matter the most to you act like you don't even exist.  This is the case of Lexi Smart - a young woman who has the misfortune (or would that be fortune?) to suffer a brain injury after falling down a set of steps.<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella is a masterful story teller; she mixes real life with just enough drama to carry you along and helps you invest in her characters.  She takes Lexi from an average \\"any woman\\" to an ambitious, super styler who now has the sleek body of an athlete and makes us all wish that we could be her; then Sophie switches it up and we discover that there are cracks in the perfect exterior and that not everything is picture perfect.<br /><br />The story gets even more involved when we find out that Lexi's last memory is indeed from three years earlier, but that the reason she's in the hospital is because of a very recent car accident.  Somehow her brain injury jumps her memory back three years and it was during those three years that she consciously made all the changes in her life.  She just doesn't remember how or why.  She decides to jump right in, thinking that if she plays along, hopefully her memory will return.  So she moves in with her gorgeous husband, makes plans to visit her job and see her friends. She just can't understand why she's no longer tight with the girls at work that she used to always hang out with.  She even meets a man that seems to know her more than he should and before long, the sparks begin to fly!<br /><br />Readers are treated to a mystery as Lexi takes on the task of discovering who she is and what is really important to her - she learns just what events sparked the tremendous changes in her life and as she gets to know herself, she discovers who she really wants to be.  We ride along with Lexi as she takes on challenges and wonder if she'll ever regain her memory and if or when she does, how will it change her life?<br /><br />As a personal aside, after reading this book description, I actually gasped!  This is ME!  Well No, not really but this book really meant something to me personally, as I too, woke up in the hospital after a bump to the head after falling down the stairs and I had no recollection of it either - my life hadn't changed much - except I did lose almost 10 pounds (feeding tubes are great - there's practically no fat pumped in there!) Fortunately, all my important memories are still intact, but it was so intriguing to me when I saw the description of this book that I just had to read it and I'm so glad that I did! Everyone can enjoy this tale; even if you haven't found yourself in Lexi's shoes (or mine!) because the story speaks to everyone about the perils of wanting \\"the good life\\" and what can happen as you discover that maybe, just maybe what you really want isn't \\"the good life\\" at all!ed to always hang out with.  She even meets a man that seems to know her more than he should and before long, the sparks begin to fly!

0316143472|5.0|This is the must-read book for anyone taking a \\"staycation\\" this summer.  Sit in a chair and forget about the high price of gas and the economy tanking while laughing out loud at twisted mind of David Sedaris.  He mines the commonality of everyday experiences - - an obnoxious seat-mate on an airplane flight, the use of certain four-letter words, walking at a different speed than your partner on a vacation - - for bits of doofus humor that leave us both laughing at him and thinking, \\"I know exactly what he means.\\"  It's much more relaxing than fighting crowds at the airport or spending hours on the interstate.<br /><br />In this collection of essays, Sedaris takes us from his childhood in Raleigh to his time in New York to life in Normandy, and finally, to quitting smoking in Japan.  Who goes to Japan to quit smoking?  Meeting colorful characters is a reason to travel and Sedaris's don't disappoint.  We meet the lazy substitute baby-sitter, Mrs. Peacock (hair like a mermaid's, the color of margarine), busybody neighbor, Helen (bullying the other tenants and subjecting him to her Famous Italian Dishes), and April, the spider he took to Paris.  Sedaris's takes on  the deeper issues of loss, fidelity, bigotry, and addictions are touching but no less comedic than any of his lighter subjects.<br /><br />Time spent in Sedaris's world is escapism at its funniest.  I want to go there more often.
B00005JKEZ|4.0|This is a wonderful classic adventure film, which can be enjoyed by the whole family despite the fact a number of persons meet their end by the sword or bow and arrows of Robin Hood. The action scenes are well staged but there is little in the way of blood spilled on the silver screen.  Errol Flynn does a superb job of filling the role of the hero and the other actors are also well cast and rise to the occasion.      As for my criticism, Robin seems a little too over confident at times during the situations he places himself in but I guess being familiar with the script helped Errol with this point.  For someone who can split an arrow in half with his own from many yards away it is also difficult to believe that Robin could not recognize King Richard from a few feet away.  Finally, some of the costumes seem more suited for a high school play.    If you can overlook these latter points and just going along for the ride I am sure you will enjoy this film.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|Smart, snarky and just plain biologically young, the debut from Panic! At The Disco was jam-packed with every trick in the pop-songbook. Wedging every trick in the power-pop songbook into one CD, it was a surprisingly successful effort. You'll hear elements of Duran Duran new-wave, Cheap Trick's pop-rocks zap, and arch emo-irony ala friends Fall Out Boy. They even smuggle in some of the progressive elements via Queen or The Beatles that would bloom in full come [[ASIN:B00132D808 Pretty. Odd.]]<br /><br />That said, this is still a very adolescent effort, with the primary topic being girls and angst over girls. The best songs here, like \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\" and the delightful ironic \\"Build God Then We'll Talk\\" sound like songwriter Ryan Ross saved up every clever idea he'd ever had for a song and used them up in three and a half minutes. Sometimes that doesn't always work (the voice tweaking on \\"Nails For Breakfast...\\" being the worst offender), but more often than not, Panic, along with producer Matt Squire, manage to take multiple genre tricks and blend them into a sweet and snappy whole.
1932100660|5.0|Before I review the book, a little history of me here:    When I was a chubby girl in college I tried many kinds of diet to lose weight, and one of them was a \\"healthier\\" form of Atkins diet, called the South Beach diet. I read from a Women's Health magazine that it's effective and nutritious. At the time, I did not have any knowledge of nutrition, and unfortunately I had followed the diet thinking that it's healthy. Of course, I gained weight soon after unable to keeping up with the diet and failed miserably. I was sick all the time also and didn't know why. I had many health problems and was on a variety of different prescription drugs that my doctor urged me to take.    Many years later, I decided to become a pure vegetarian not only because of health but because of realization of my diet's impact on the environment and animal welfare, thanks to several documentaries called Baraka & Earthlings. When I became a vegetarian I lost weight almost effortlessly, and as I gradually dropped dairy and egg products from my diet I lost even more weight - the weight that I had worked so hard to lose but failed to as a non-vegetarian! I am now healthier than ever, never get sick, and feel so much better overall, all without depending on unnecessary drugs and doctor visits.    Even so, after I read this important book - the largest research conducted on correlation between nutrition and health - I was extremely shocked at this fascinating study. Now, I cannot stop talking about the book with everyone that I care about. Everyone who is interested in their health effects of consuming animal products should read this very important book.    According to the study, cancer, heart diseases, osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol - all of these modern diseases can be prevented and even reversed by whole food, plant-based diet! I am now a firm believer of this, as I watched my family members suffer greatly (i.e. cancer, osteoporosis, etc.) due to their animal-based diets. Everything became so clear to me. Now, my whole family follow a more plant-based diet than ever. My sister, my boyfriend, and even my mom - follow a vegetarian diet and have improved their health greatly.    Everything makes sense to me. There are so much misinformation out there regarding diet and health, that public can be easily confused about what and how one should eat, like I was.    As a vegan who was once a heavy meat-eater, I hope more people can realize the truth and obtain better health, as well as helping to restore our environment, and end unnecessary suffering of animals.

B000NZL268|5.0|As an educator, I have found Blokus to be a game that entertains as well as teaches students about reflections, flips, and rotations. The game is engaging, it holds the students' attention longer than the other games I have purchased. My students participated in tornaments with others classes and practiced often in order to win the competitions. I strongly reccomend this game as it teaches problem solving strategies as well as crucial critical thinking skills that are essential for lifelong learners. Furthermore, Blokus is becoming a fast favorite among the adults in my circle of family and friends.
6304712944|5.0|I found this little gem in 1986 on VHS. It was \\"pan and scan\\" and void of any special features. Now on DVD it shines with a beautiful presentation, better sound and a nice retro documentary. Richard Harris immediately became my ideal King Arthur. I could sing along to all the songs and really appreciate the wonderful cinematography.    It has a tackiness that is ultimately endearing. The myth of Camelot is a fairy tale for grown ups. History aside, this film will live for generations!
B0001HAISG|5.0|Great movie! My 4 year old son loves pirates and we already owned the Walt Disney movie but he really prefers this movie version.  It has real kids and makes it more real to him.  I also enjoyed the movie.
B0013FXWX8|4.0|...and yet I left the theater unfulfilled.  So now I'm really perplexed.  I love all forms of animation (done well) and I do enjoy well choreographed Kung-Fu action.  This film was at least, better than average in those departments.  I appreciate good voice-over work (it's not that easy) and humble characters; check and check.  Of course, solid story telling and really cool set pieces can make any film memorable.  Kung Fu Panda has all of the above.  So I'm still struggling with the fact that I left the theater less than blown away. I guess I should dissect the situation.<br /><br />-WHY AM I JADED?<br />Perhaps I've seen too much animation (is that possible?).  With all the great computer animation that goes on these days, what will it take to impress me?  Prior to KP, a preview for the new computer animated \\"Clone Wars\\" film was shown.  While 10 years ago, this would have been an event, today it looked pretty crappy; my wife and I sneered.  You'd think KP would look awesome after seeing that.  It probably did look awesome, but what haven't I seen computers do before; nothing.  So, I probably am jaded.  Honestly, most of this film was beautifully done, but it didn't seem to matter; that's really disappointing for me.  No sure answers here.  I'm still missing something.<br /><br />-WAS THIS A GOOD STORY?<br />There was absolutely nothing wrong with this story.  It had originality while still paying proper homage to the Kung Fu film traditions.  It had funny moments and beautifully choreographed battles.  It had numerous wonderfully original set pieces to stage the battles and events in.  It had strong continuity and meaningful plot points. It was as predictable as most \\"Kids\\" films are but still well thought out.  Yet, I felt something was missing?  So far I have managed only to find more questions than answers.  Let's look at the details.  Maybe I'll figure it out there?<br /><br />-BLACK IS BLACK (I want my baby back?)<br />Of this I am sure, the panda was Jack Black.  Just as Robin Hood was Kevin Costner and Han Solo was Harrison Ford, Jack black is usually himself regardless of the role.  I like Jack Black (at his worst, I find him tolerable).  However, here he was playing an American Panda.  I couldn't let this slip by.  I could not ignore his American colloquial speech or his fan-boy demeanor.  As loveable as his character was, he seemed completely out of place.  He was funny and charming and disarming and loveable, but he wasn't in any way Chinese.  I know this is ludicrous; he's a freaking Panda for gosh sake!!  But he was in China and he was all American.  As dumb as that is, it just bugged me.  A couple other voices bugged me too (Dustin Hoffman was also too \\"American\\").  Despite the good \\"acting\\", I guess this sort of damaged the context of the film for me.<br /><br />-IS PAYING HOMAGE BECOMING CLICH&Eacute;?<br />I have produced yet another question (sigh).  How many films pay homage to classic Kung Fu cinema?  I honestly don't know.  I do know it's a lot.  I don't have anything against the genre; I actually enjoy those films.  But maybe I've seen too much?  Maybe it's getting just a little bit tired?  Perhaps I am, once again, jaded?  That really would be too bad since this film has some really cool fight scenes.  I think my problem might be that while paying homage, this film cheats; it's all done with computers.  Doing it with live actors is much more impressive.  My kids liked it though.  This might be a strong answer (finally).<br /><br />-HOW DEEP IS DEEP ENOUGH?<br />GEEZE!!! ANOTHER QUESTION!!!  The point is, is there enough depth in these characters?  I'm thinking maybe not, especially for \\"The Five\\".  These are the Kung Fu \\"masters\\" of the film and yet, all we really know about them is their fighting styles.  They are all really cool on the surface, but have only a little depth.  Some fringe characters were more highly developed.  I'm not sure how you develop 5 characters more deeply in an animated feature.  I supposed being \\"cool\\" should be enough; jaded?  I've definitely seen worse.  Though fairly shallow, they are cool.<br /><br />-DID YOU LIKE IT OR NOT MORON!!!???<br />That's the only question you want answered, I'm sure.  Well, obviously I was divided by this film; half of me admired its honesty, attention to detail and faithfulness to the Kung Fu genre.  The other half became distracted by annoying details that spoiled it's \\"authenticity\\" a bit.  Because this was homage to the Kung Fu genre, the story followed a somewhat familiar format.  So the story, though well executed, was not completely fresh. The action, though beautifully staged, was only a pile of bits and bytes leaping around the screen and not real people and therefore, less impressive. I guess my personal \\"WOW\\" bar has been raised by the limitless potential of computer graphics, and thus I have become a bit jaded.  Despite my lack of enthusiasm, I would have to recommend that you and your kids see Kung Fu Panda.  It is a well made film that should still excite young minds and un-jaded adults alike.initely seen worse.  Though fairly shallow, they are cool.    -DID YOU LIKE IT OR NOT MORON!!!???

B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's one of the fantastic TV shows with interesting characters, well-written screen play, charming and real fun (for me) story line and great sense of humor. I recommend watching a movie Serenity after finished the series. Well, I like all of them even more! Worth watching. Worth buying!
B000ZK4466|2.0|I've been holding off on reviewing this album since its release to make sure that I gave it a fair listen and try to get used to the new sound. Each of their 3 previous albums has grown on me over time and almost gets better each time I hear it - that sadly not the case with Bedlam in Goliath. Cedric's voice sounds so thin, high, and piercing on this album compared to earlier releases that i've wondered whether he might have damaged his natural voice somehow. This album also seems to be lacking the interesting and melodic vocal and guitar themes that are sewn together seamlessly on their earlier albums. Bedlam in Goliath has the feeling of an album rushed - transitions seem unnatural and  forced at times and the band members aren't quite on the same page with each other.  I've seen many reviews comparing Bedlam to Deloused based on shorter song lengths relative to the other albums, but shorter length does not equal structure or song development in this case. Despite my disappointment with this album, i still consider them to be one of my favorite bands and will look forward to their next release to see what these talented musicians have in store for us next.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|I read the book before watching the movie and this movie was completely disappointing.  Read the book
B0013J30W2|5.0|WANTED is an adrenaline-throbbing, fast-paced, solid action movie.  I would have loved to have seen more Fox and less Gibson, but his story is interesting enough to keep me watching.  This was a lot of fun to watch on a hot summer night.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|I have been a fan of Ms Summer for years, and this latest release does not disappoint. As I enjoy music of all kinds, I really like this album as it crosses genres and presents the listener with a variety of great tunes, excellently arranged and produced, and sung beautifully as only Donna Summmer can. Those used to her earlier releases should note that this is quite different, but if approached with an open mind, you will be listening to this for months, repeatedly, without being bored!
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Neat movie. I hated the beginning. It was boring and full of fake, bad acting. My husband said \\"keep watching\\" and I was glad I did. This turned into a neat thriller
B0015HOFZI|3.0|On the whole I am satisfied, but I think there could be some improvements, like perhaps Sony could provide a hard copy instruction booklet on how to use the software, for those who don't like or who are not used to reading online/onscreen help. Also, the webpage showing the product should include vital accessories you can buy together with the set, in particular, the replacement stylus meant for this model.    That said, it arrived at my place in perfect condition - from the USA all the way to Singapore.
B000QUCNP4|3.0|Zodiac is long. Maybe it just felt longer because I happened to be tired when I saw it. I am not going to sit through it again just to find out.  Luckily it also happens to be very good with an excellent cast. There are no crazy car chases, shootouts, or fancy explosions and you don't even get the satisfaction of the capture of the Zodiac, yet it is still a solid film. What you get is a story that follows the methodical progress of police work and the investigation of a cartoonist turned journalist.
B00008AWNY|5.0|There's a reason this album seems to consistently win \\"Best Rock Album of All Time\\" on many reviews I've seen.  Besides the classics you've probably heard so many times, like \\"Time\\", \\"Money\\", and \\"Us and Them\\", there are long, very dreamy, instrumental passages, and many sound effects, such as those you hear at the beginning of \\"Money\\" and \\"Time\\".  It is an album with an almost hypnotic quality.  It is definitely one not to be missed by any rock fan.
0393330435|3.0|As an early adopter of the TRS-80 (1978) and later Apple II I have been an avid reader of much history of this period.  There are great nuggets of inside events in this book but a little too much of Woz's philosophy and not as much new as I had hoped.  The tech info was great though some of it a bit hard to follow which might be understandable of a proven genius telling his story.
0786948523|1.0|I purchased my first DnD product about 30 years ago (the blue boxed set).  I was a strong supporter of the 2nd, 3rd and 3.5 editions.  I thought all were improvements upon what came before.  I can hardly believe it, but 4th edition will be my last DnD purchase, ever.  The game has been oversimplified to the point that the life has been sucked out of it.  What follows is what I wish I read before I made my purchase:  Here is what it will be like to play a 4th edition character.      All characters (and most monsters) will have 3 once/day powers, 3 once/encounter powers and 3 once/round powers, even if you are 20th level.  Some may have 2 or 4 powers, but it really does not matter, because all the powers do basically the same thing: simple damage.  No more petrification, or antimagic rays, or haste or slow, just damage.  Your once/day powers will do 40 points, your once/encounter powers will do 20 and your once/round powers will do 10.  If you are a wizard, your once/round attack will be called a \\"magic missle\\", if you are a fighter, it will be called a \\"longbow\\".  Both require a \\"to hit\\", and do the same damage, so the only difference is the name.  Strategy has been reduced to \\"should I close with the monster, or not\\".  For all important battles, you will start out with your \\"40 point attack\\" until they are gone, then your \\"20 point attack\\", and then use your \\"10 point attack\\" until either you or the monster falls down.  Repeat this until you level up, at which point your new once/day power will do 50 points, your new once/encounter power will do 25, and your new 1/round power will do 15.  Continue until 20th level, then buy a new book.  Fast-paced and easy to run?  Yes! DnD? No! Just the makings of a Bad MMO. For me, the appeal of DnD was always in the imagination.  Just think of the terrors that filled your imagination as your party desended those stone stairs into the lair of a Lich.  No one in their right mind would ever try to take one on alone.    Now, in 4th edition, you know the lich will just do 80,80,80,50,50,50, then 20 points/round.  If you are high enough level to do 85,85,85,55,55,55, and then 25 points/round, then just go down the stairs and kill it, yourself.  No real risk.  No real fun, either.  DnD is dead.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|I loved this CD! Coldplay gets better & better each CD they put out. Definately well worth the wait.
B0014XCMVM|4.0|After all the hype surrounding the new release of Flavors, I was ecstatic to get my copy of the cd. A true Alanis fan, I was not let down. She still has it, and then some. Like many others, I was expecting the rage and angst/sadness from her recent breakup, but was surprised (in a pleasant way) that that was not the case. That being said, it's a superb album with tracks that will have you close to tear with the lyrics and bouncing in your seat, head nodding along, thumb tapping on the steering wheel. I think my fav. track was Torch, followed closely by Citizen of the Planet and Straightjacket.
B00154GEFU|1.0|For all the talent involved, there's just nothing here. It couldn't be more bland and uninspired. There's absolutely nothing to hang onto or give reason for repeated listening. Very disappointing.
0307386171|5.0|This was my first foray into McEwan's work and I am glad to report that this novel was absolutely striking. It had many elements I did not expect but the prose was consistently vivid. There aren't many events in the novel (indeed, not much happens at all) but we are transported back throughout the year before the novel's present. This is done in a concise way that is maximized by the quality of the description. I found the novel to be a perfect length for what it was attempting to achieve.
0316067601|5.0|Reading over most of the reviews, its hard to find anything that hasn't already been said.  This is just an amazing book, and if you have any interest in the military, then you will enjoy this book.  It shows what our armed forces are capable of, and even shows a type of compassion that many Americans would never believe could happen in Afghanistan.  If you are trying to decide to read this book, think no further, read it!
B000002GB9|5.0|If you don't have Styx's 1977 'The Grand Illusion' in your collection, than you are really missing out. While Styx were somewhat famous before, 'The Grand Illusion' was their breakthrough record. Songs like 'The Grand Illusion' and 'Come Sail Away' are played on classic rock radio stations all the time.    And it's not hard to see why. Styx rocked. They were a perfect blend of soft ballads (many were dedicated to Dennis DeYoung's wife, Suzanne) and hard rock tunes.    I know, so far, this isn't much of a review. But that's going to change right now.    So, here it is. The album by album, track by track review.    1. The Grand Illusion  And so begins Styx's masterpiece. This song is probably my favorite song they did. As a huge prog rock fan, I couldn't be more satisfied. Dennis' vocals are superb here, better than ever. Tommy and J.Y. do a great job backing him up. A MUST LISTEN!!    2. Fooling Yourself  One of Tommy's best songs. 'Why must you be such an angry young man?' is the opening lyric, and the rest is history. Another must listen. It sounds just as good as it did 31 years ago, in 1977 today!    3. Superstars   A classic, but very underrated tune. I never understood why. 'Superstars' is a great rock tune; Dennis' keyboards are at their best, and this is a classic Tommy Shaw vocal piece. A MUST LISTEN INDEED!    4. Come Sail Away  Probably the centerpiece of the entire Styx catalog. Definitely their biggest hit. The heaviest song Dennis sang on, no doubt; it starts off as a dreamy, sort of fantasy-in-music type of song, and than it gets really heavy. If you haven't heard this, than you probably aren't a classic rock listener. 'Come Sail Away' is, again, a must listen!    5. Miss America  James Young takes the vocals for this song. 'Miss America' is another rocker; for those of you that think Styx plays nothing but fluffy pop rock, your wrong! And 'Miss America' proves it. Heavy vocals, great guitar lines and bass lines throughout, this is a must listen for any Styx fan and classic heavy metal fan!    6. Man In The Wilderness  Don't let the title fool you. This is a rock tune indeed. Tommy's vocals are superb, and the guitar riffs are incredible! A great rock and roll tune from Styx! Another must listen!    7. Castle Walls  Probably the weakest track on the album, but still great! Dennis whispers, but proves he can sing perfectly--even while whispering! A very dreamy tune, but great keyboard lines throughout. Don't take what I said the wrong way, about this being weak. It's not! It's just it's weak compared to the other songs here.    8. The Grand Finale  And what a way to close out the record! This is only 2 minutes, but it's quite a way to end a masterpiece. This is very underrated, but it's superb, as is the rest of the record. A great way to close out a masterpiece!    Styx's 'The Grand Illusion' is a must have for any serious record collector. 1977 was a great year for music, and 'The Grand Illusion' is definitely one of the best records of '77. You must listen to this.     Overall, this is highly recommended for any Styx or classic rock fan. A prog rock masterpiece. A must listen indeed.    Highly recommended. A masterpiece, plain and simple.    ENJOY!!!
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie. When I was younger, we used to make a weekly trip to the video store and this is always the movie that I rented. I watched it almost daily for many years. There is another reviewer I saw that said that it would be insane to show this movie to kids, but I can say that as a kid who was obsessed with it, I came out unharmed and still love it. Buy this movie, you won't regret it.
0385720920|4.0|This is the second Chuck Palahniuk book I have read having started with the frightening, \\"Haunted.\\" I liked Choke, didn't love it. It was a fantastically quick read. I enjoyed the character of Victor Mancini, but the author does not present anything likeable about him. I would venture a guess that this is the authors style throughout his catalog. Choke is a biting social satire and will make the reader rethink views on addiction.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|My main girl loves this guy.  So she was happy with the CD.  Me, I prefer the original MAN (Sinatra).
B00166BL6Y|5.0|And it's today~ this release is everything it could be, including the complete recordings of this quartet (the 2001 remaster left off Sunshine Day) and complete BBC sessions; I'd heard rumors of Serenade to a Cuckoo & Cat's Squirrel BBC performances, but had never seen them even on bootleg till now.  This stuff is gold.  BBC So Much Trouble, Beggar's Farm, and Dharma For One had never seen official release before, and Song For Jeffrey & Stormy Monday were interrupted by the radio announcer on previous releases.  These are all uninterrupted.  I understand the previous comment of them sounding a little flat, production-wise.  But the performances--though some are characteristically shorter for BBC--certainly lack none of this lineup's energy or musicianship...I'm loving the newfound instrumentals in particular.  At first, I thought the My Sunday Feeling was one of those studio-live hybrids (perhaps with live guitar only), but after very careful comparison I'm convinced the BBC is a different performance; drums, guitar, and vocal are different (Ian sings the \\"don't nobody ask me\\" line rather than the studio \\"won't somebody tell me\\"), and I think drums tell the tale--maybe it's the vocal effect on Ian's voice that makes it sound like the studio.  One does hear simultaneous vocal & flute on Beggar's Farm and a bit of Sunday Feeling, but minor overdubs happened on BBC (Cream, for example).  Love Story is the only one my jury's still out on, sounds like there could possibly be some importing of studio tracks~ but not definitively.  Anyone else care to listen & weigh in?    Oh yeah, and This Was itself.  Rolling Stone once wrote that Tull was never again so ferocious musically, and it's true (though New Day Yesterday & Nothing is Easy on Stand Up, and Teacher's instrumental break are throwbacks).  The rhythm section of Cornick and Bunker just couldn't, and still can't, be beat~ they're each about the most underrated players on their instruments that I can think of.  And Abrahams' playing is so distinctive; the BBC stuff just underscores that.  Too bad One For John Gee didn't close the original album, it's one of my very favorites, too~ kind of a two-minute compression of this Tull in a nutshell.  They only include it on disc 2 here, but it's here.    Only Song For Jeffrey (not counting Love Story) really points to where they're headed, the album title is incredibly prescient.  But by all means, stop here and soak in this original version of Jethro Tull.  These guys smoke, and I really wish I could jump in a time machine and watch them cook the Marquee club in 1968.    I do wish a critical essay of the album's significance was included, but there are liner notes from each band member, so can't really complain.  Ian's are mostly repeated from 2001 and are the longest by far, but glad everyone was acknowledged.  They really were a band with the voices of every single member creating the sound.    I hope deluxes happen for Stand Up, Benefit, and Aqualung as well.    *ADDED COMMENTS~ After more listens, the BBC Cat's Squirrel surpasses the studio version hands down for me; it's a minute shorter, but Abrahams is doing more interesting stuff, and it's great on the final return to the riff where he catches Bunker during a drum roll and Bunker continues rolling it all the way through to re-entry.  This performance is a must-own, given the dearth of recordings by this lineup.    Also, the studio remixes of Christmas Song & Love Story--especially the latter--really are different, and wonderful.  The string instruments on the latter are separated for the first time so you can really here what's being played.  Flip right back to the mono mix and you'll here how muddled it all is in the middle~ classic sound, sure, but it's sweet to have the alternative.  So sweet, in fact, that now I want one for One For John Gee; my only, ONLY complaint.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|Open your mind to a whole new perspective...even though you may think you know this story! Excellent casting,cinamatography and costumes, even though the script could, occasionally, use some help. This movie has become a part of my library.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|This item arrived in good time and was in excellent condition.  I would buy from this person anytime in the future.
B000002P2W|4.0|After the brilliance that was \\"Tommy\\", \\"Who's Next\\" and \\"Quadrophenia\\" there had to come a let down.  That let down would be The Who's mid decade album \\"By Numbers\\".  As a stand alone disc, this one is actually quite good, but compared to the band's previous catalogue it is not really in the same league.  The album produced a hit single with \\"Squeeze Box\\" which I guess is ok for a novelty song, but pales in comparison to many of the band's other singles.  The best songs on the album deal with Pete Townshend's realization that he is no longer a kid and having to deal with mid life events.  \\"However Much I Booze\\", \\"Dreaming From The Waist\\", and \\"They Are All In Love\\" are good examples.  The often underrated John Entwistle contributes one of the better tracks in \\"Success Story\\".  Overall this is a good Who album, but it has the unfortunate task of following three all time classics, so in comparison the album is a slight step down.
0930289234|5.0|I read that this book is one of the best graphic novels out there, so I was intrigued, but what got me to buy this book was that it is going to feature film and is on slate for release March '09.  Outside of all that, I read the book, cover to cover, in 3 days, man I couldn't put it down, and I work full time.  The characters are just fantastic, and the framing of every scene is like nothing I've ever seen, it's a ride that I didn't want to end, but when it did come I was too eager to start reading again, making sure I hadn't missed anything.  You actually root for these people who are trying to save the world.
B0011FXLCC|4.0|This album represents a dramatic rethink for Goldfrapp: out go the stomping glitter beats and whip-crack synthesisers, in comes \\"psychedelic folk\\". Most of the material on Seventh Tree focuses more on subtle, slow-moving ambience. Some more up-tempos would have been nice, but Seventh Tree still makes for good post-party chill- out music with style.<br /><br />This Deluxe Edition comes with a DVD, some postcards and a little notebook with the lyrics. Great presentation.
B000002I97|5.0|My mother had been looking a particular song for my father.  She mentioned it to me in a call prior to Father's Day this year.  I told her to just give me a second and I found it on Amazon.com quickly and easily.  She said that my father loves it and listens to it every time they get in the truck.  Thanks...

3836501899|5.0|I recently purchased this book and must say that this is a beautifully created masterpiece. Give it up to Taschen for yet another exquisite piece of documentation; this time showing the love and art of the polaroid instant medium. This book provides a visual history of art created through the polaroid lens by some of the great photographers. If you love polaroid you will love this book. Simply a must-have for any enthusiast.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Given as gift and the recipient was thrilled.  I was, however, disappointed at how long it took for me to receive this item.  Shipping was slower than usual for Amazon.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I didn't think I was going to like this album. As talented as Timbaland and Timberlake are, their presence in so many new pop releases is getting old. Frankly, their styles aren't really my cup of tea either; I usually prefer the European dance styles used in Confessions on a Dancefloor.    But after a few listens to Hard Candy, I'd be lying to myself if I said it wasn't good. The production is as fresh and exciting as any new Madonna record should be. Most tracks are accessible, catchy, danceable, and FUN. There are some daring, unconventional song structures to keep things interesting, along with a smattering of colorful bells and whistles to help evoke the \\"candy\\" theme. I'm almost reminded of a fresh bag of Skittles when I hear parts this album. That being said, I still don't see why people think it \\"doesn't sound like Madonna.\\" This may be the case with a few songs like 4 Minutes (my least favorite on the album), but most songs are unmistakably hers at the core.     The hooks and choruses may be catchier on average than her last album, although there is some weak continuity in spots. The cover artwork, a bit trashy and regressive for today's Madonna, does not truly represent the music and should be different altogether. I liked Confessions better overall, but Hard Candy is still a solid and worthy effort from one of the greatest pop icons of all time.    (Side note: For those who want something in the vein of Confessions on a Dancefloor, check out Cyndi Lauper's new dance album Bring Ya to the Brink.)
B000OT6V00|5.0|Hellboy is an awesome movie with a lot of action.  The blu-ray is great since the graphics are really enhanced.  Amazon also had a great deal on it!
B000A6T1JU|4.0|This movie is made of the win. I wish that there was more special features or that the movie was extended or something, but overall this movie is a very interesting view on a dystopian future where gangs have style, and \\"waste\\" people instead of killing them... most of the time. If you've ever seen A Clockwork Orange it's kinda like that, but more about action than psychological, and not really as intelligent, but that's okay.
B000Q66PXE|5.0|There have been quite a few great reviews of this excellent HBO series so I won't go into details about the plot, actors, etc.  Instead I would just like to add my voice to the comments that HBO comes up with some of the greatest shows that have ever graced the television screen; Sopranos, Oz, Deadwood, Carnivale, Rome (although Showtime has been giving them a run for their money lately with Brotherhood, Dexter and the Tudors).  Then they either take a really long time to air new seasons (as in The Sopranos) or cancel it after only 2 or 3 seasons when we are really hooked (as in they did with Carnivale, Deadwood and now Rome).  I always thought that the really great thing about premium cable channels was not the movies, but in their ability bring us daring shows that we would not have seen otherwise.  Here HBO sets the standard.  Lately though they seem to lose their nerve too quickly and cancel great programs way too early.<br /><br />That being said, I bought both seasons of Rome and I will proudly put them on my shelf, right in between Carnivale and Deadwood.
0316143472|3.0|When You Are Engulfed in Flames is another typical effort by David Sedaris. Fans of Mr. Sedaris' previous works know exactly what to expect with a Sedaris essay collection, and although they won't be completely disappointed, they might wonder if they had already read this one before.<br /><br />As a huge fan of David Sedaris' previous essay collections, it is with a heavy heart that I write my fear that Mr. Sedaris has finally exhausted his repertoire. While still somewhat amusing, the stories feel recycled and tired and seem to comprise of all the antedotes we have read before.<br /><br />David Sedaris needs a new shtick because after reading When You Are Engulfed in Flames, I felt the same way I do after I watched the third sequal to a once great movie.
0743277708|5.0|I love this book. It's been one of my favorites since I was a little girl and my Dad read it to me now I'm 33 and I'm on  my 3rd copy. I read the first one until it fell apart, the second (this is the part you won't beileve)my pet rabbits ate. My new copy will be safe because the rabbits no longer live indoors.
0609610570|5.0|My former boss presented this book to me in Audio-book format.  The Audio book is read by the authors themselves.  Not only do the authors provide valuable insights, but they deliver the message very well.<br /><br />This book explains Execution is a specific set of behaviors and techniques that companies need to master in order to have competitive advantage.  It is targeted to CEO's and executive managers and a definite must-read for CEO's and their coaches and advisers.  For the rest of us mortals, it makes an excellent read, especially the real world examples that they provided. I wish they had provided more such examples.  It is about following through as a leader providing different thought processes on how to lead and more importantly, how to make sure you get the job done!<br /><br />The main message is that in order to execute the strategies that they develop, companies have to integrate their people, strategy and processes. Without proper execution, even the best strategies fail. The hardware (strategy and structure) is inert without the software (beliefs and behaviors).<br /><br />The point which hit a home run with me was: A job no Leader should delegate which is having the Right People in the Right Roles.  This is so true and so common sense and yet it is most often delegated to other departments or heavily focused on certifications, quantity (number of years) vs quality of experience.  An organization's human beings are by far its most reliable resource for generating excellent results year after year. Their judgments, experiences, and capabilities make the difference between success and failure. The quality of their people is the best competitive differentiator.  While okay to use assessment scores and certifications to validate capabilities, an organization must also identify weaknesses for improvement, streamline training and create career milestones.  Then measure progress toward attaining and exceeding corporate goals.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone in a Leadership role, especially if you're managing people in your organization.yone in a Leadership role, especially if you're managing people in your organization.
0316067601|1.0|I have spent time in the military working with Special Ops forces.  I suspect that real Special Operators would be ashamed at the way the author describes how great he (and his buddies) are.  Half the book is just a rehash of BUD/S, and is nothing new.  I am also from Texas, and his endless blathering/bragging about Texas gets pretty old even for me.  The heroism described in the second half of the book is extraordinary, but I found myself wondering if the author was telling the truth.  He makes several misstatements of fact early on that made me think he was not genuine and just trying to sell books or just making things up.  I was very touched by the compassion shown by his friends and neighbors while waiting for word from Afghanistan.  This struck me as genuine.  I have the utmost respect for our US Special Ops forces.  I just don't think he represents the SEALS as the professionals they are.  For example, I suspect SEALS realize that the US military exists largely as a tool of foreign policy used to protect and further US interests.  As such, it is subject to civilian control.  The author laments this reality, and comes off as whiney.     I had heard the book was very good, and I was very disappointed.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|Quick review, i love Kurt Russel and that was the only reason i watched this movie. The first 35 minutes are several women talking and that is it. Finally Kurt comes on as Stuntman Mike, you would think all the talking the women do would further the plot but it doesn't. He talks to them at a bar get's a lap dance then well let's just say there is about 8 minutes of bloody action. After that it switched to ANOTHER set of women talking for another 30 minutes. Turns out 2 of the girls are stunt women and one has a gun. They get into a cool car chase with Mike then *spoiler* either knock him out or kill him you can't tell. Then the end. So quick summary, 2 hour movie, 2 action scenes that are total 15 minutes long and the rest is talking, cussing and boring. Maybe watch it on t.v. one of these days for the 2nd car chase and save yourself some time, yawn.

B000054OTY|5.0|Theatrical Release: March 30, 1961<br />Director: Marlon Brando<br />Runtime: 2 hours and 21 minutes<br />Stars: Marlon Brando, Karl Malden, Pina Pellicer, Katy Jurado, Slim Pickens, Ben Johnson, Sam Gilman and Larry Duran<br /><br />DVD INFO: Since \\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" is public domain it has been released by numerous dvd companies with varying levels of quality. One version I saw was so bad it was unwatchable, but I can highly recommend two: Digiviw (which is available for a buck at Wal-Mart) and Platinum Disc Corporation (or PDC Home Entertainment). Both of these versions are WIDESCREEN (despite the fact that the Digiview version erroneously says on the back cover that it's full frame) and the picture quality is very good. So don't let the fact that these versions are usually sold for a buck fool you; these are quality dvds worthy of your video library. Other reviewers here at Amazon testify that the Front Row version is very good as well.<br /><br />THE STORY: Dad Longworth (Malden) literally \\"takes the money and runs\\" as he leaves his young partner in crime, Kid Rio (Brando), behind to rot in a Mexican prison. Rio escapes 5 years later with only vengeance on his mind. He finds Dad in Monterey, California, now a respectable town Sheriff with a Mexican wife (Jurado) and step-daughter Louisa (Pina), living the American Dream on the beautiful Pacific coast. The situation is complicated by Rio's teaming up with two lowlife criminals whose only intent is to rob the Monterey bank, as well as Rio's romantic dallyings with Louisa.<br /><br />\\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" was Brando's only stab at directing and his original cut of the film was twice as long (!). I would love to see this director's cut, which HAS been shown on TV, but this 141-minute cut is fine as is.<br /><br />Not only is \\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" one of the best Westerns of all time, it's also one of Brando's top films, along with \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" (1962), \\"The Young Lions\\" and the underrated \\"The Missouri Breaks,\\" not to mention \\"Apocalypse Now.\\"<br /><br />What makes it so great? Numerous things. Brando is at his most captivating here, but the story is entrancing as well, even though it's much more of a slow drama than an action/adventure film. When it comes, however, the action is quick and realistic.<br /><br />There are numerous themes running through the long story. One of the major ones is the clash of the misfit with conventional society. Since society is composed of a bunch of conformist misfits, the misfit must learn to conform if s/he wants to fit in and succeed. In other words, if you want to 'make it' in conventional society it's necessary to hide your problematic past & flaws and put on a front of respectability. Dad Longworth has figured this out and he's not about to allow Rio to ruin it for him. (I'm not saying I completely agree with this as I don't believe in being fake, just that it's one of the major themes of the story).<br /><br />I would like to offer a word of defense for Dad Longworth here. Although it was wrong for him to take the money and leave Rio to be captured, one can't help but empathize with him and the reasons why he gave in to the temptation. If he went back for Rio there was a high risk of getting captured or killed. The safest and most promising route was the selfish route. The good thing is that Dad wisely took advantage of this opportunity and made a good life for himself in Monterey. He was obviously sick of his criminal lifestyle and wanted a real life, a real job and real family. He was getting on in years and knew that this may well be his final opportunity, so he took it.<br /><br />The problem is that one's past always has a way of haunting us, which is another theme of the film; hence, Rio walks back into Dad's life 5 years later and his American dream is seriously threatened. Notice Dad's rage when he whips/beats Rio to an inch of his life; he's doing everything in his power to kill the ugly phantoms of his past, which is why he triesto get Rio hung on false charges later in the story.<br /><br />Another theme is redemption and how love is tied to any such positive transformation. Both Dad and Rio are criminal scumbags, but both desire redemption and a better life. The love of Dad's wife and the Monterey general populace brings this out in Dad, whereas Louisa's love for Rio slowly changes him. Near the end we plainly see that Rio no longer wants to kill Dad, he doesn't even want to see him; all he wants is to run off with his lady love. If Rio remained the same person he was at the beginning of the story \\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" wouldn't be half the film it is.<br /><br />In addition, Dad's love for Katie, his Mexican wife, is what delivered Katie and Louisa \\"from the beanfields,\\" as Dad puts it.<br /><br />Love goes hand-in-hand with loyalty or faithfulness. We see this in Rio's likable Mexican sidekick, Chico (Larry Duran).<br /><br />One of the best qualities of \\"Jacks\\" is that it's refreshingly realistic. There's no goofiness, unbelievable one-liners, over-the-top action or excruciatingly dated aspects.<br /><br />Speaking of dated, although the opening credits sequence and score are dated and boring, the rest of the film isn't. So don't let this sequence cause you to tune out. The rest of the score (by Hugo Friedhofer) is great.<br /><br />\\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" was the obvious precursor to the Spaghetti Western. For instance, the protagonist is a dyed-in-the-wool \\"cool\\" anti-hero (like, say, Eastwood or Bronson). The main difference between \\"Jacks\\" and most Spaghetti Westerns, however, is that \\"Jacks\\" has a truly worthwhile story wherein numerous gems of wisdom can be gleaned, which can't be said about films like \\"The Good, the Boring and the Ugly\\" (don't get me wrong, I love the music and style of that film, it's just that the plodding story and scumbag characters leave much to be desired); also the anti-hero in \\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" slowly transforms into a potentially positive member of society.<br /><br />The film's influence goes well beyond just the Spaghetti Westerns. Take, for instance, Brando's crucifixion-style beating and long restoration. The film \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" pretty much ripped-off this entire sequence; Arnold Schwarzenegger even admits to it.<br /><br />Pina Pellicer does an outstanding job as Rio's girlfriend Louisa (Dad's step-daughter). Although she's definitely good-looking she's too skinny for my personal tastes. Spiritually-speaking, however, she's incredible. Although she commits a foolish error by sleeping with Rio after the festival (she probably had too much to drink -- another error), on a whole she's the epitome of love, virtue and spirituality. Again, this love is the key factor in Rio's positive metamorphosis.<br /><br />Unfortunately Pina committed suicide three and a half years after \\"Jacks\\" was released. Thankfully we have this film to remember her beauty and virtue. She deserves to be honored.<br /><br />\\"Jacks\\" was filmed entirely in California with all the coastal sequences photographed on the Monterey Pennisula, including Pebble Beach. This is one of the only Westerns where you'll see the Pacific Ocean, and it's truly glorious! Other locations include Big Sur and Death Valley.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Don't miss out on \\"One-Eyed Jacks,\\" Brando's only directorial effort.

B001AD3NIM|5.0|\\"Citizen Of The Planet\\":  The angst of life on this ever evolving earth.  The instrumentation cradles her voice and the riffs are just under her tone.<br /><br />\\"Underneath\\":  This is classic Alanis, albeit with a twist.  The twist is tasty and will make the very hairs on your body rise.  The music is almost negated in the listener's mind with her voice so carefully placed within this track.<br /><br />\\"Straightjacket\\":  The perfect anthem for anyone with a co-dependency.  I find this track most personal,  perhaps you will too.  Musically,  this track is perfect and the programming grinds away like a lullaby.<br /><br />\\"Versions Of Violence\\": The orchestrations on this track deserve a listen,  this track is a rollercoaster of musical and emotional whims.  Never judge a song by it's title.<br /><br />\\"Not As We\\":  A piano gift wrapped in the beauty that is her voice. Love.<br /><br />\\"In Praise Of The Vulnerable Man\\":  Perhaps a slight,  every so slight, country riff.  This song is a lyrical triumph as her voice etches the lyrics out in such a way that will delight even the hardest critic.<br /><br />\\"Moratorium\\":  A declaration,  softly, of true independence.  A perfect track,  haunting yet overtly pleasant on all levels.<br /><br />\\"Torch\\": A crooning track,  my least favorite,  although the lyrics bring this track to a five star.<br /><br />\\"Giggling Again For No Reason\\": A pop treat with a sugar so sweet you'll almost gag with the delight of a bulimic. The programming is perfection here.<br /><br />\\"Tapes\\": A metaphor,  not in song.  Autophrenia,  perhaps.<br /><br />\\"Incomplete\\": A swaying to and fro,  perfect composition within the jewel that is this song.<br /><br />\\"Orchid\\":  Oversampling at it's finest. Her voice has never been more angelic.  An orchid by any other name....<br /><br />\\"The Guy Who Leaves\\": Great rock song with her lyrics of anger at a set point. This song boils away without leaving any salt behind in the pot.<br /><br />\\"Madness\\":  Her vocal is focal here,  it works so perfectly.  Don't blame anyone,  not even yourself.  Thank U for all you've given me in the world of negativity.<br /><br />\\"Limbo No More\\": A balladesque track with sweeping vocals and trinklings of stars.<br /><br />\\"On The Tequila\\": A fun song.

Both of these versions are WIDESCREEN (despite the fact that the Digiview version erroneously says on the back cover that it's full frame) and the picture quality is very good. So don't let the fact that these versions are usually sold for a buck fool you; these are quality dvds worthy of your video library. Other reviewers here at Amazon testify that the Front Row version is very good as well.<br /><br />THE STORY: Dad Longworth (Malden) literally \\"takes the money and runs\\" as he leaves his young partner in crime, Kid Rio (Brando), behind to rot in a Mexican prison. Rio escapes 5 years later with only vengeance on his mind. He finds Dad in Monterey, California, now a respectable town Sheriff with a Mexican wife (Jurado) and step-daughter Louisa (Pina), living the American Dream on the beautiful Pacific coast. The situation is complicated by Rio's teaming up with two lowlife criminals whose only intent is to rob the Monterey bank, as well as Rio's romantic dallyings with Louisa.<br /><br />\\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" was Brando's only stab at directing and his original cut of the film was twice as long (!). I would love to see this director's cut, which HAS been shown on TV, but this 141-minute cut is fine as is.<br /><br />Not only is \\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" one of the best Westerns of all time, it's also one of Brando's top films, along with \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" (1962), \\"The Young Lions\\" and the underrated \\"The Missouri Breaks,\\" not to mention \\"Apocalypse Now.\\"<br /><br />What makes it so great? Numerous things. Brando is at his most captivating here, but the story is entrancing as well, even though it's much more of a slow drama than an action/adventure film. When it comes, however, the action is quick and realistic.<br /><br />There are numerous themes running through the long story. One of the major ones is the clash of the misfit with conventional society. Since society is composed of a bunch of conformist misfits, the misfit must learn to conform if s/he wants to fit in and succeed. In other words, if you want to 'make it' in conventional society it's necessary to hide your problematic past & flaws and put on a front of respectability. Dad Longworth has figured this out and he's not about to allow Rio to ruin it for him. (I'm not saying I completely agree with this as I don't believe in being fake, just that it's one of the major themes of the story).<br /><br />I would like to offer a word of defense for Dad Longworth here. Although it was wrong for him to take the money and leave Rio to be captured, one can't help but empathize with him and the reasons why he gave in to the temptation. If he went back for Rio there was a high risk of getting captured or killed. The safest and most promising route was the selfish route. The good thing is that Dad wisely took advantage of this opportunity and made a good life for himself in Monterey. He was obviously sick of his criminal lifestyle and wanted a real life, a real job and real family. He was getting on in years and knew that this may well be his final opportunity, so he took it.<br /><br />The problem is that one's past always has a way of haunting us, which is another theme of the film; hence, Rio walks back into Dad's life 5 years later and his American dream is seriously threatened. Notice Dad's rage when he whips/beats Rio to an inch of his life; he's doing everything in his power to kill the ugly phantoms of his past, which is why he triesto get Rio hung on false charges later in the story.<br /><br />Another theme is redemption and how love is tied to any such positive transformation. Both Dad and Rio are criminal scumbags, but both desire redemption and a better life. The love of Dad's wife and the Monterey general populace brings this out in Dad, whereas Louisa's love for Rio slowly changes him. Near the end we plainly see that Rio no longer wants to kill Dad, he doesn't even want to see him; all he wants is to run off with his lady love. If Rio remained the same person he was at the beginning of the story \\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" wouldn't be half the film it is.<br /><br />In addition, Dad's love for Katie, his Mexican wife, is what delivered Katie and Louisa \\"from the beanfields,\\" as Dad puts it.<br /><br />Love goes hand-in-hand with loyalty or faithfulness. We see this in Rio's likable Mexican sidekick, Chico (Larry Duran).<br /><br />One of the best qualities of \\"Jacks\\" is that it's refreshingly realistic. There's no goofiness, unbelievable one-liners, over-the-top action or excruciatingly dated aspects.<br /><br />Speaking of dated, although the opening credits sequence and score are dated and boring, the rest of the film isn't. So don't let this sequence cause you to tune out. The rest of the score (by Hugo Friedhofer) is great.<br /><br />\\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" was the obvious precursor to the Spaghetti Western. For instance, the protagonist is a dyed-in-the-wool \\"cool\\" anti-hero (like, say, Eastwood or Bronson). The main difference between \\"Jacks\\" and most Spaghetti Westerns, however, is that \\"Jacks\\" has a truly worthwhile story wherein numerous gems of wisdom can be gleaned, which can't be said about films like \\"The Good, the Boring and the Ugly\\" (don't get me wrong, I love the music and style of that film, it's just that the plodding story and scumbag characters leave much to be desired); also the anti-hero in \\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" slowly transforms into a potentially positive member of society.<br /><br />The film's influence goes well beyond just the Spaghetti Westerns. Take, for instance, Brando's crucifixion-style beating and long restoration. The film \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" pretty much ripped-off this entire sequence; Arnold Schwarzenegger even admits to it.<br /><br />Pina Pellicer does an outstanding job as Rio's girlfriend Louisa (Dad's step-daughter). Although she's definitely good-looking she's too skinny for my personal tastes. Spiritually-speaking, however, she's incredible. Although she commits a foolish error by sleeping with Rio after the festival (she probably had too much to drink -- another error), on a whole she's the epitome of love, virtue and spirituality. Again, this love is the key factor in Rio's positive metamorphosis.<br /><br />Unfortunately Pina committed suicide three and a half years after \\"Jacks\\" was released. Thankfully we have this film to remember her beauty and virtue. She deserves to be honored.<br /><br />\\"Jacks\\" was filmed entirely in California with all the coastal sequences photographed on the Monterey Pennisula, including Pebble Beach. This is one of the only Westerns where you'll see the Pacific Ocean, and it's truly glorious! Other locations include Big Sur and Death Valley.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Don't miss out on \\"One-Eyed Jacks,\\" Brando's only directorial effort. It's truly one of the GREAT Westerns, as well as one of Brando's most captivating performances.<br /><br />Hopefully they'll release the 5-hour \\"Director's cut\\" one day.theme is redemption and how love is tied to any such positive transformation.

0060589469|1.0|Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is perhaps the most tedious, pedantic, tiresome, misleading, and intellectually-barren book I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Perhaps the worst thing about this self-absorbed, unreadable rant is that on every page, Persig seems compelled to draw attention away from his text's lack of substance by providing countless misrepresentations of all the great philosophers. Not only does he use language that is dry and uninteresting, but he incorrectly describes nearly all of the philosophers and philosophical systems that he mentions.<br /> Pirsig's book is nothing more than adolescent rambling. On every page, Pirsig arrogantly and vainly tries to portray himself as some kind of synthesis of erudite Western scholar meets wise Eastern sage. Nothing could be further from the truth. One of the most despicable aspects of his pedestrian work of pseudo-philosophical tripe is that he uses his own quasi-philosophical terminology to describe concepts that could better be represented using the terminology of existing systems. He constantly tries to reinvent many philosophical terms, and then misuses other terms. The result is a most confusing and convoluted read, especially if you are already versed in philosophy. Perhaps the saddest thing about Pirsig's mock-literary atrocity is that many people seem to regard Pirsig's arrogant tirade as an introduction to philosophy. Nothing could be further from the truth. The book could potentially serve as a dull introduction to pathetic, narcissistic, schizophrenic authors who manage, through some quirk of fate, to achieve popularity, but that's about it...

Though there is no credit re: remastering, the set is superbly remastered and rebalanced while the longer songs (I Heard It Through The Grapevine, Suzie Q) appear as single 45 rpm edits (which suits me fine anyway!). The songs are classic, the sound is remarkable. It's all on a single 2008 CD and the brief notes provide great info. What more could one ask for? Surely the time has come for Concord (who now owns Fantasy) to retire Chronicles Vol. 1 & 2 and Creedence Gold and provide fans with a proper, budget priced, superb sounding 2008 anthology (like WEA did with The Doors). Yes, the individual albums all appeared in remastered form at the end of the 90s and as great SACD hybrids in the early 2000s. Yet sadly, no newly remastered anthology is available here as of this late date. Until someone does that, this collection surely serves as \\"The Best\\" of CCR

B0017I1FO4|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this band.  Buy any three of their albums and you will be happy.  Shinedown is excellent at writing radio friendly songs (which is so needed to be able to sell albums), but they are also able to write amazing hard rocking songs.  This album is no exception and should appeal to many different fans; hard rockers and people who enjoy radio friendly, pop/ballad songs.  There is no reason to skip any song on this album.  So please purchase and enjoy!     Hard Rockers should like `Devour' (the first single and a perfect choice.  Hard rocking, catchy lyrics and beat, and great riffs), `The Sound Of Madness', `Cry For Help,' `Sin With a Grin,' and `Cyanide Sweet Tooth Suicide.'  This album has more slowed down, pop/ballad type songs than the previous albums.  However, they are still able to add good guitar riffs and these songs have great lyrics and are my favorite.  People who like this type of music will like `Second Chances,' `The Crow & The Butterfly', `If You Only Knew' (the slowest song, kind of a love song which is rare for Shinedown, but an excellent song), `What A Shame,' `Breaking Inside,' and `Call Me' (this is a incredible song; worth the price of the album by itself).   I hope more people tryout and discover Shinedown.  This band was made the old fashion way, by word of mouth from heavy touring with a great live show and by making solid music!

Mike terrana was the engine that drove this band you can see why he left.  It started on the last album now this cements it.  How boring can we get the music is flat and peavys lyrics which are usually very interesting seemed to be phoned in.  Time to rethink what you are doing guys other bands do the european powermetal thing alot better than you.

B000OT6V00|4.0|I had never heard of Hellboy and when I saw the trailers for this movie I concluded that it wouldn't interest me.  I ended up catching it some time later and really enjoyed it.  It goes into the origins of Hellboy, so those that aren't familiar with the character aren't lost.  The movie itself is alot of fun, action, great characters, very unique.  I think fans of fantasy, sci-fi and action films will really enjoy this.  Ron is perfect for the part.  I am anxiously awaiting hellboy 2!  Try it out it might surprise you.  As far as the blu-ray extras, there weren't many.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|When I first heard Avenged Sevenfold, it was in a car on the way to the guitar store, and I really didn't like them too much.  I bought City of Evil after constant listening with my friend, and it grew on me.  I loved Beast and the Harlot from the first listen.  Burn it Down is great and I love how it transitions to Blinded in Chains.  Bat Country is instantly loveable, and what isn't there to like throughout the album?  It is truly one of the best guitar albums in recent memory.  The relentless leads, the catchy riffing- the vocal delivery... Honestly, what isn't there to like about this album?  Now, the hardcore A7X fans may hate this album, but I don't see actual singing as a reason to hate an album.  The talent that composes A7X really shines through, be it guitars, vocals, or drums- the musicianship is stellar.

This book is just plain boring, but worse yet Mr. Child has decided to tell us what he REALLY thinks, i.e. those of us who enjoyed and supported Jack Reacher are \\"chickenhawks\\" without the courage of our convictions.So far more than half of the Amazon reviewers have given \\"Nothing To Lose\\" 2 stars or less. If he tries to write one more book maybe Childs will find that he did, in fact, have something to lose!  [[ASIN:0385340567 Nothing to Lose (Jack Reacher Novels)]]
0316143472|5.0|Years after achieving notoriety with \\"Santaland Diaries\\" and after many tales of cringing (and often astounding) self-revelation, it is reasonable to ask if David Sedaris can still deliver a story you would never imagine in print or if he can turn a phrase unlike anyone else. In short, yes he can. Sedaris still sets the standard for bracing, introspective writing that offers laughs with a lingering sense of pathos.<br /><br />Long-time readers will find the collection of stories to be a seamless addition to Sedaris' body of work. The new chapters deepen and expand upon familiar subjects such as Sedaris' life-long negotiation with an anarchic family; mainstream expectations of \\"success,\\" and a world filled with very random, very odd characters.<br /><br />Newcomers to Sedaris will have no problem starting here. Sedaris' strength as a writer is his ability to beckon to absolute strangers and proceed to tell them the most revealing stories about himself in a wry, disarming way. However, it is very likely that a new reader will rapidly move onto Sedaris' other books because there really is no one else who tells a story like him.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I heard about Shelter on Afterelton.com, read the reviews, watched the trailer, and being a fan of Gay Cinema, became really curious as to how this one was going to be. I've seen a lot of gay cinema; and I find it unfortunate to say that a large quantity of it has been... less then par.  It's either bad writing, low production value to the point of hurting the story telling, it's too weird....     Shelter is a very well told, well produced film that deserves every award it's won. The acting is good, the shots are beautiful and for once, it's a gay film that  [SPOILERS]      ...actually ends happily. I must say that I found this just as, if not slightly more enjoyable then Brokeback Mountian

Royal Albert Hall was the place where they played in May 2005.<br /><br />You will be able to watch how their emblematic battle songs like Crossroads, Toad, Sunshine of your love, Politician, Sitting on the top of  the world  and Badge were played with a freshness that really mocks about the fat than almost forty years had elapsed. Bruce in the bass, Baker with that fabulous solo in Toad or the living legend of the guitar Eric Clapton at their best, proving the quality and artistic conviction make fun of the time.<br /><br />What a great CD. For you it's a must-have.
B000WGWQG8|3.0|Update to my review:  At the end of the series, John was shown quoting God's Word - FINALLY!  Also, I have replied to some comments.        I have only seen five episodes and can say it is a good miniseries (it shows a lot that most people don't know about our history), but I thought is was distasteful to show John and Abigail involved in intercourse and if the idea was to convey his intimate moments, I could not believe they did not show him reading his Bible or praying (although he spoke of praying).  I have heard that he is quoted as saying that he read his Bible everyday, and yet they did not show this.  Most all the Founding Fathers spoke of God and His Word often.  I'm not saying that they were super relegious and said \\"Praise Jesus\\" all the time.  I believe the relationship they had with God and Christ, His son, and God's Word was more real and practical.  The quote said by Ben Franklin in the miniseries, \\"Well, we have our Rebuplic, if we can keep it\\", actually was ended with \\"so help me God\\", but they left that out of the miniseries.  So this is a watering down of history, and my favorite DVD will still be \\"1776\\" which highlights God's part a little bit more.  Taking God out of the founding of our country is like replacing the powdered wigs they wore with spiked, mohawk haircuts.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Going into Cloverfield, I was incredibly curious. Would I vomit from the camera? Could this monster be the next Godzilla? Could a movie work with NO stars? Could J. J. Abrams flop in the face of hype again? To answer those in order: No, Doubtfully, Yes, No. In fact, I think this movie is an instant classic that isn't afraid to turn Hollywood rules on its head. What Abrams and company do is take the old premise of monster in NYC and take it from a whole new Point of View. And POV is what this movie is all about.<br /><br />Main Camera Man Hud is obviously not good with the camera, as seen in the beginning, compared with Jason's camera work. Being from the younger demographic, this shaky-cam doesn't phase me at all, since I am probably used to YouTube effect. And let me say, if you thought Hud's camera work was bad, you should see mine. Nobody would have made it out of the theater without falling down in a dizzy drunken stupor. So anyways, while we're used to the normal omniscient camera style of the all-seeing-eye, seeing everything, this style does have its advantages. It provides the film's best \\"Oh Crap!\\" moment in the tunnel, when they turn on night vision.<br /><br />The bad thing about this style is the fact that it's very hard to keep up with the camera, and everything going around. So, it's kind of hard to tell which person is dying, and who is alive. It didn't help any that both Beth and Lizzy were both brunettes. So, it took me awhile to figure out what happened on the Brooklyn Bridge, who was put into the helicopter first, and who was with Rob at the very end. I also didn't know that Lizzy's helicopter went down. But thankfully, there's Wikipedia to give you a scene-by-scene summery of the movie's events.<br /><br />I also liked the little touch where everytime the camera was turned off, you had the little moment's of Rob and Beth's Coney Island date. Not much, but it just seems to strangely work in the movie, and gives a nice break to the action going on around.<br /><br />Speaking of action, it's pretty darn good for a movie made on the budget of most romantic comedies. The suspense and action keeps you on your toes, and there's plenty of cringe moments that keeps the mood all the more intense. Although I really could have done without the exploding stomach and the rescue of the impaled girl. But I thank the movie for being restrained, since they could have easily gone into R-Territory, which would have made the whole film a cheesy horror film. Oh yeah, it would be \\"The Blair Witch Project.\\"<br /><br />Let me also say that the famous/infamous Statue of Liberty head in the streets scene, will go down as one of the classic Hollywood scenes. I mean, the scene is just so classic. Head flying down and rolling down in the streets. The Shock. The \\"OH MY GOD!\\" being repeated over and over. The Surprise. Total classic.<br /><br />For being a no-star movie, everybody in the cast does an excellent job. There's no bad acting, no fake acting, all the emotions seem real, and in fact, these actors do a better job than their more famous counterparts would do. And for a lack of character development, I liked most of the characters in the movie, and when I could tell that they just died, I was saddened by their loss. Except for Marlena, who I didn't get the appeal of.<br /><br />However, when it came to Hud, I was deeply saddened by his loss. Maybe it's because I'm a fan of T.J. Miller since he stole the show on the now cancelled Carpoolers. The guy is just likable, and he brings his personality to Hud. Alas, this brings me to  my next complaint.<br /><br />Why did Hud have to die? I mean, he just seems to be cheapened when he's eaten by the creature, just for the sake of us getting a facial glimpse of the monster. I would have liked it if Hud was like the only survivor, and found a way to escape operation \\"Hammer Down.\\" Sure, incredibly unlikely, but still. Instead, the film ends up a bit depressing, since basically every characteryou've met during the course of the film, is dead. And the monster seems to still be alive. Yet, it's nice to see the profession of love at the end, and it again, strangely seems to work.<br /><br />But for all of that, you also have to add the realism of the entire thing. I mean, if a monster like that were really to attack NYC (highly unlikely), that's probably how it would take place. And most importantly, these seemed like real characters, not cardboard cutouts of twenty-somethings.<br /><br />So overall, for it's realism, originality, execution, characters, and premise, this movie earns the title of \\"Instant Classic.\\" It defines a era that is 2008, where terrorism is the first thing you think of when a major disaster happens, the YouTube/Camera Phone culture and just society in general. It's the little things that make the movie more than the big things, and they work in unexpected ways. Sure, I would have probably changed a couple of things, but it all seems to work. As for the rumor of sequels, I'm a bit hesitant, as is the crew, because you really need a new gimmick, as this has already been done. And quite well I might add.ter seems to still be alive.

B0017I1FO4|5.0|This album is definately what I expected and have been waiting for from Shinedown.  It has a good balance between of good hard rock and meaningful ballad.  With songs like \\"Sound of Madness\\" bringing back southern rock type music, Shinedown is able to captivate your attention and get your blood pumping.  The album also blends in story/song ballads such as \\"The Crow and the Butterfly\\" and \\"If You Only Knew\\" which offers a nice change in pace throughout the entire album.  If You are looking for a resurgence of southern rock, a hard rock album without the psychosemantics, or just some songs to get you up and going, this album provides rock and roll done right.

I was glad I had that under my belt before I tackled \\"The Power of Now\\".<br /><br />For me, these books are wonderful guides to living a peaceful, happy life no matter what happens to you.  What I like about them is you can take the concept of God to wherever you are comfortable yet the principles still stand.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this book and if you have the time, do the classes on Oprah.  Hearing from the author himself is helpful and rewarding.

The places the author talks about are very seldom seem by the average person, making it all the more interesting!  What a wonderful adventure that most of us can only dream of.  Great Summer Book!!!

B000VDDDY6|5.0|Season One Remastered is a fantastic investment for Star Trek fans who want something different. ALL views of space and ships are redone with modern CGI effects. No longer do we Trekkers have to suffer through gritty stock footage of the Enterprise orbiting the same red planet. Each planet looks different. Even if you do not have HD (I don't, and HD got discontinued anyway), the picture is sharp! Some noticable changes include:    -Where No Man Has Gone Before: the Enterprise goes through the galaxy barrier evasively. The nebula colors are beautiful!  -Mudd's Women: Excellent effects of the Enterprise chasing Mudd's ship in an asteroid field, where it explodes!  -The Menagerie I, II: Star Base 8 looks REAL, not cardboard cut-out. The sky has realistic atmosphere with planets in the background. It's as cool as seeing the Remastered Star Wars trilogy back in the 1990's!  -Balance of Terror: this shows the ships entering a comet that LOOKS like a comet, instead of a blue smudge of paint!  -Galileo Seven: By far this is THE BEST EPISODE FOR IMPROVED SPECIAL EFFECTS! The green nebula is so real, with cool shots of the shuttles flying in and out of the Enterprise.  -Court-Martial: More stunning shots of a starbase. City towers actually have people inside. The Enterprise orbits the base with an extra star ship and shuttles buzzing around.  -A Taste of Armageddon: Alien planet's city has futuristic monorails and people walking around.  -Errand of Mercy: REAL KLINGON SHIPS, one even blown up. We no longer have to wait until the third season to see a Klingon battle cruiser!  -Alternative Factor: Great ship-to-surface phaser blast effects.    One other benefit to the sharp picture is that we Trekkers can clearly see the faces of the dying \\"extra crewmen.\\" This means we can appreciate how human they really were, and how life is too precious to waste. Let us now honor their memories by recalling how they died in the line of duty:    -The Man Trap: 3 dead on alien planet, 1 on ship, after monster sucked crewmens' salt from their bodies.  -Where No Man Has Gone Before: 1 crewman dead after he was telekinetically strangled by a chord, by Gary Mitchell  -The Naked Time: 1 Joe \\"Red Shirt\\" goes mad, stabs self with butter knife.  -Balance of Terror: 1 soon-to-be-married crewman poisoned by pink gas  -Galileo Seven: 1 crewman stabbed by spear-throwing caveman creature, 1 choked  -The Arena: 2 \\"Red Shirts\\" killed by Gorn disruptors  -The Devil in the Dark: 1 slow-moving \\"Red Shirt\\" melted by angry mother horta.    May these twelve brave crewmen rest in peace!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have to admit... I thought I was in good shape. I have been working out for years. I just finished working out with a personal trainer for a few months and did a fitness boot camp a few months ago. This video had me working harder than they did. I started at level 2. Brought in my 8 lb weights thinking they would be too light. Ummm...NO! I had to reduce to my 5lb weights for 2 exercises. Even had to pause a few times with a rear delt exercise she had us doing with the 5lbs weights!  SHE IS GOOD. She does not give you time to lose your heart rate so you are burning fat and calories big time during her 20 min workout. If you want a routine that is going to kick your butt in gear...this is the one! Oh yeah, and I loved her sense of humor. Nothing like laughing while you are working out. Makes it not seem so bad when you are yelling at a t.v. :)  ENJOY!
B0011KQSZ4|3.0|This is not a hilarious, laugh-out-loud riot, though it is funny and amusing in a subtle way.  Even though some of the humor is a little base, and some of the plot you can see coming from a mile away, it's still amusing.  I would say it's more entertaining than funny, I think.<br /><br />To be honest, it's a movie that left me with mixed reactions.  I wanted to like it a lot more than I did.  It was one of those movies I can't particularly fault (other than the transparent plot) but I can't pick out much that was stellar, either.  The actors and acting were solid, but not great.  The plot was interesting, but not surprising and astounding.  The characters were varied and not at all shallow or two-dimensional, but nothing really special.  It was one of those movies that was okay while it lasted, but will fade from memory fairly quickly.<br /><br />I'd say it's a good Sunday night 'I have nothing else planned' kind of movie.
0316143472|5.0|This book was fun -- I could not put it down and read it in two days. It is as good as any of his previous books. I totally recommend it!
0393327345|4.0|It is pretty rare to find that a movie, when based on a book, that can stay true to the spirit of the book.  In this case if you have seen Fight Club (the movie) it is nearly the same as reading Fight Club (the book).  In fact, they are so closely tied that I was able to skim parts of the book because I already know the plot so well.<br /><br />Having said that, there ARE differences.  If you were a real fan of the movie I think you can gain an even greater appreciation of what they achieved.  In many ways I think the screenwriter took the plot of the book and made the movie version even better.  I'm not really sure if that speaks well of the novel.  Surely Chuck tapped into something quite primal here but I don't think he really did the subject justice or it wouldn't have have been so easy to adapt to a mass market audience.<br /><br />If I were going to highlight all the differences between the movie and the novel it would be a fairly short list.  The main difference is the ending which I think was done considerably better in the movie version.  In the novel you're left with a really weird ending that could be interpreted many ways.  Sometimes that is fine but in this case it almost seems like Chuck just got tired of writing and said \\"the end, fill in the rest yourselves\\".  The movie version was just a lot more clear and tied everything together really well.<br /><br />In short I'd recommend a read if you enjoyed the movie.  Fight Club can be read pretty quickly and I think it only took me about 2 hours to finish it.

0385340567|2.0|I've read all the Reacher novels and grabbed this as soon as it came out.  Alas, a letdown.  I could hardly follow the plot, and worse, a tedious political correctness (absent in the earlier books, but beginning to rear its head in recent Reacher novels) really spoiled things.  OK, G.W. Bush and friends are getting to be a drag, and no one is too happy with the war, and the Christian right can be obnoxious, but that ain't why I read escape literature.  As well as all that, there is a kind of tired feeling to the book, as if the formula has gotten boring to the author, who's just going through the motions.  Maybe it's time for Jack to settle down with one of his numerous loves, have a couple kids, and tend to lawn care.

B0010X745K|1.0|Based on many other reviews, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great.  But given Frank Darabont's near-perfect impressions of Shawshank and Green Mile, I figured I should at least give it a shot.  Turns out I was unprepared for what is truly an awful Stephen King adaptation.    To be fair, making a good horror film is difficult.  It's even harder to make a good horror film based on a book that was so lovingly-crafted.  The book is full of such vivid people, monsters, and events, that your imagination will sculpt images no film can possibly re-create.  And the sheer terror and suspense with which King describes the coming of the mist and particularly the ill-fated expedition to the pharmacy simply do not lend themselves to the film medium.  That isn't to say that Darabont couldn't have done worlds better, but ultimately, this is a movie that just should not have been made.    Many people will say that King is simply bizarre or weird or will use some other pejorative.  That is naive.  There is a heart and warmth to his writing that was captured so well by the Shawshank and Green Mile films.  This film has none of that.    Most offensive to me was the ending, and for multiple reasons.  First, it is badly shocking.  Darabont even admits in the commentary that it is partly for shock value.  I don't claim to be a Stephen King expert, but I've read a good 10-15 of his books, and this is one ending I can tell you he would never write.  Yes, the end scenario is alluded to within the book.  But from what I know about David Drayton, I would assert that he is incapable of such an act.  Second, Stanley Kubrick took some big liberties with The Shining, but where he transformed the original King story into a strong work of film that can stand alone, Darabont butchered the original text with his overuse of artistic license.  King outwardly claims to have \\"liked\\" the ending, but I wonder what he really thought.  I will admit that the book's ending would not work in a movie.  Butthat is just another reason this story should have been left alone.    There were things I enjoyed.  I thought the monsters were tremendous.  Their appearances were not far from what I imagined whilst reading the book.  Credit must be given to the special effects team.  However, it seems that special effects are what Hollywood really excels at these days, so good monsters are to be expected.    We know that Frank Darabont is capable of directing moving, worthwhile films.  He must have seen that The Mist would be a dud.  Why in the world would he choose to go through with it?  The DVD extras explain that the budget was indeed meager.  And why did Paramount Pictures back out?  Dimension Films wound up being the studio, a company that brought us such forgettable dreck as the Scream trilogy and all eight incarnations of Hellraiser.  This movie is definitely their cup of tea.
B000VR824S|5.0|Great stuff!  It really runs the entire gamut.  Of course Clapton is terrific.  Beck and Tal Wilkenfeld rock. Didn't know Mayer rocked like that. For me Winwood is the highlight (duh).  Unfortunately, Sheryl Crow somehow got there; and then, heavens forbid, she did a duet with Willie Nelson.  Skip that!  But get the DVD.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|Practically unheard of, most people haven't had a chance to see this movie. I don't remember when it was in the theatres and I didn't see it until after I re-discovered RDJ in \\"Iron Man\\" this summer. This movie is surprisingly good with plenty of witty dialog and smart one-liners. The plot gets a little confusing, but if you're in any way a fan of RDJ or Val Kilmer, you'll find a way to hold on.
B000VS6R26|5.0|I'm sure we've all heard this line about the great movies of the past, \\"Gone With the Wind\\" etc, but Titanic is a lot like those classics.  Adventure, romance, humor, desperate times, heroes, villans, and damsels in distress, it's got it all and it delivers.
B0000549B0|4.0|My favorite part is Elwood's response when people ask \\"Can I do anything for you?\\" or \\"What can I do for you?\\" He says, \\"What did you have in mind?\\" and it throws people. They don't know how to react, which to me is funny.  I also like that the viewer gets to decide who's \\"sane\\" and \\"not sane\\". The cab driver's speech about the way people act on the drive to the sanitarium vs the way they act on the drive home was poignant.

B00000F14B|1.0|Watch out for this DVD! The authoring needs to be vastly improved, as does the overall quality of the transfer. I tried four borrowed/rented copies of this edition in attempting to find a copy that my Coby DVD player wouldn't choke on. Finally I ordered a NEW copy, which looked somewhat suspect to me (bootleg? not sure). A big clue was that even though it played, initially the DVD player's display BLINKED continuously! The silk screen printed label on the DVD is also a little off. The picture seemed overly edge-enhanced as well as dull and in need of chroma correction. The second play registered better, and with a few tweaks the anamorphic picture improved, but it's still not up to today's DVD standards. Remember, this disc dates back to 1999 (with paper packaging to match)! Warner Brothers needs to issue a remastered Blu-Ray disc to get the full beauty of the original Techniscope (8 perf) negative, which was selected for preservation in 2005.  So if your copy isn't up to speed, I'd say return it for a full refund.

It made me think if this is what it is like when you pass on and can see the world and your family from up there.It is also a little sad about how she dies and to see how her family goes on without her. It touches on all the people in her life and how her death affects them each differenty and what they do about it in her memory.
B0001ZX0OM|5.0|I think this movie is very well done.  The story and the characters portrayed are both excellent.  Tim Robbins plays an extremely disturbed individual, and rightfully so.  The grieving Sean Penn and the diligence of Kevin Bacon amongst the back drop of the small network of childhood friends, very well played.  The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.  And the ending... was not at all what I had anticipated.  Well cast and extremely good acting.

0440243661|4.0|Titling the book, \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\" works from a Jack Reacher perspective.  Reacher's always got some of the first and lots of the second.  This time, Reacher gets to display some skills from his past that Child's readers have never really seen before - his ability to lead, specifically a military team.<br /><br />As the book opens, there's plenty of ...bad luck and trouble.... for Calvin Franz, who is dumped from a Bell Helicopter down into the desert floor. Scratch Calvin's character. Later, we learn that Calvin was one of 8 of hero Jack Reacher's old military police outfit.<br /><br />Reacher is author Lee Child's relentless drifter hero, and this is Child's 11th tale of Reacher's life after he leaves a career as a military hero. Reacher is sort of a magnet for violence and trouble as he tours around the United States, essentially homeless, with few possessions, and liking it that way. Before he learns about Calvin, Reacher is leaving Portland, Oregon, on a bus with essentially no plans.<br /><br />Enter, in a round about way, Frances Neagley, a female loner who was once a member of Reacher's troup, and is today a very successful private intelligence operative. Neagley tells Reacher of Calvin's death, and together they discover that 3 other members of the team are also missing. They reach out and assemble the remaining members of the team to unravel and avenge the murder(s). Southern California becomes a brutal field for them to some government shenanigans and international terrorism.<br /><br />Here, Reacher relies more on intellect than his penchant and talent for violence and death. There is a lot of tough banter in the book, and the same sly and ironic humor that Child has peppered the series with. Ultimately, the mystery and the action are more than satisfying, and the team disbands... Reacher is now left to go it alone again.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand, there is plenty of violence in the book, and there are also some situations that make you question Reacher's integrity - a new, and not necessarily welcome surprise to the reader.<br /><br />Still and all, \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\" is a great installment in the series, gives good new dimension for the hero, and a book that can be read as a stand alone. It's always a possibility that Child will resurrect the troop, or at least one or two of the characters in future offerings as well.d not necessarily welcome surprise to the reader.

B000WCBPOG|4.0|If you are a Beatles fan, I do not think you will be disappointed in this movie. My husband is a Beatles fan but not a musical film fan at all. He has watched it twice now and admits it is a great movie 'for a musical'.
B000U7169M|2.0|Professor Katherine Winter (Hilary Swank) was once an ordained minister, but has since relinquished her faith and title after the tragic death of her husband and daughter.  (Before going further, it needs to be said that Swank is actually very pretty in this movie, the most feminine of her career, and the only real reason to watch The Reaping)  With anger and despair filling her heart, Winter spends her free time disproving religious-themed miracles.<br /><br />Next up is a small Louisiana bayou town and a collection of Biblical plagues, as the fish die in a river that looks like a giant batch of Koolaid, which eventually leads to the demise of the WB frog, and flies that are apparently reincarnated ninjas (you'll understand if you see it).  The anxiety of small-minded townfolk and a need to blame someone leads the yokels - especially a cartoonish mayor who looks like Colonel Sanders' morbidly obese cousin - to blame a young, swamp-dwelling girl based upon nothing more than the hearsay of a local busybody.<br /><br />Anyway, it's up to Winter to disprove the plagues and make rational decisions - even though it's clear that Swank didn't make one when she signed on for his movie.  Eventually she has to cross the line between the possibilities of a disapproving God wreaking havoc, and a mischevious Devil tricking local idiots who no doubt follow the same philosophical principles as [[ASIN:630529142X The Waterboy]]'s momma.  All of this is mashed together with misfitting subplots of cults and child sacrifice and convoluted flashbacks, not to mention a pointless secondary minister who I hoped from the beginning would incur the nasty boils plague.<br /><br />With a boring, hokey ending, and a collection of uninteresting characters, the \\"surprise\\" plot-twist was spoiled.  When God eventually reigns down his judgement, I sincerely doubt it will be this boring.  Believable science behind the plagues is supported by a mesmerizing DVD-extra that explains how the events could have occurred, but there isn't really much in the actual movie's fear or horror department.  Unfortunately, it's completely stereotypical - the disbeliever's faith-restored moment takes place, the black sidekick dies before the end, and there is a painfully unnecessary set up for a sequel.  Otherwise it's single-viewing, derivitave movie that should have been sacrificed at the terrible script alter.here isn't really much in the actual movie's fear or horror department.

0446402389|5.0|Warning:  Some spoilers in the review below.<br /><br />Long a fan of \\"Citizen X\\" the HBO film about Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo, who killed children at large in the Soviet Union from 1978-1990, I'd heard some buzz about \\"Child 44\\", but didn't read any reviews until I purchased the book.<br /><br />The young British author, Tom Rob Smith, made my jaw drop with his version of historical fiction, because yes, Smith takes the tale of Andrei Chikatilo (who has been written about in true crime genre) and moves it BACK in time, keeping the tale somewhat intact but setting it in Stalinist Russia in the early 50's.  The contrast is startling, because, by the 80's, near the end of the Cold War, the denizens of the USSR had been disillusioned by the \\"glory\\" of Communism and had spent decades poor, hungry, frightened of the state.  Despite that, the hunt for Chikatilo in the 80's was funded and followed, somewhat as an afterthought, by the state.<br /><br />In the 50's, with Stalin's grip on the nation--it's a worker's paradise in everything but reality.  And the leader would never allow such crimes as murder to exist.  And with this change of landscape, the author, with what must have been painstaking research of the times, heightens the suspense, creates a sense of absolute hopelessness, and puts the military hero tracking the killer in fear for his own life and those of his family.<br /><br />Pursuing the killer, and refusing to denounce his own wife, Leo Demidov places his own career and life in jeopardy.  In addition to the deft way in which the author moves from Leo's childhood to his present, from the killer to Demidov and back, and into the stark conflict that is Leo's life with his wife, Raisa, Smith doesn't give up his terse, descriptive style; of the forbidding Lubyanka, he writes:<br /><br />\\"Its façade created the impression of watchfulness:  rows and rows of windows crammed together, stacked up and up, rising to a clock at the top which stared out over the city as though it were a single beady eye.  An invisible borderline existed around the building.  Passersby steered clear of this imaginary perimeter as if fearful they were going to be pulled in.  Crossing that line meant you were either staff or condemned.  There was no chance you could be found innocent inside these walls.  It was an assembly line of guilt\\".<br /><br />Brilliantly conceived, and flawlessly executed, \\"Child 44\\" is the best book I've read so far this year.single beady eye.

B00082ZS5W|5.0|What can I say?  This is possibly the best live recording I've seen!  On par with Kasey Chambers' [[ASIN:B0002IT9T8 Behind the Barricades]] PAL DVD and [[ASIN:630463949X Fleetwood Mac - The Dance]], which are also outstanding.<br /><br />I didn't notice the alleged spyware on the CD, since I have a Mac.  Ripped both the DVD and the CD and put them on the AppleTV.  Quality is pretty good for such a dark concert.  Mostly, this sounds like an improved version of the actual studio recordings, with quite a bit more energy (after the first two songs).
0385340567|1.0|Child takes a \\"Left\\" turn into politics, bashes the military, justifies AWOL for an 18 year old Marine who supposedly had two deployments and a third scheduled within two years (doesn't happen) and yet, in true fashion, bashes the rule of law and order in society.  I don't mind the latter but the former (based on an untruth), plus an implausable story line makes this his worst book yet.  I have read them all with considerable enjoyment, until this one.
B00164DWEA|3.0|Louis Leterrier's \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" dispenses with all the how-Dr.-Bruce-Banner-became-a-hulking-monster stuff in the opening credits (the result of gamma ray poisoning from an experiment that went terribly awry, for those who don`t already know), thereby making the film more of a sequel to the Ang Lee version from 2003 than a remake of it (even though all the parts are played by different actors).  Though far from perfect, that earlier \\"Hulk\\" was, I believe, unfairly pilloried for being just a tad too brooding and a trifle too thoughtful for a mind-numbing, feel-good summertime blockbuster (it WAS an Ang Lee film, after all).  Well, most of that \\"problem\\" has been eliminated in this new version, which has streamlined its story into a virtual nonstop orgy of chase sequences, exploding vehicles and general CGI mayhem.  The good news, though, is that \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" boasts the highly gifted Edward Norton as Bruce, who gives the film a human heart anyway.<br /><br />For the most part, \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" is one big long chase story interrupted by occasional romantic interludes between Bruce and his former girlfriend, Betty Ross (Live Tyler), the fellow scientist who accidentally helped to make Bruce the man/monster hybrid he is today.  Bruce's main nemesis is Betty's father, General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), the military officer who wants to capture the young man - who has spent the last several years in hiding, futilely searching for a cure - so that he can replicate the experiment and turn out a veritable army of indestructible incredible hulks.<br /><br />Norton and Tyler make a fine romantic pair, and Tim Roth does his usual superlative job as the villainous (are there any other kind?) former KGB agent who wants to be first in line to volunteer to be \\"hulked.\\"  The filmmakers, moreover, manage to fork over a little screen time to Lou Ferrigno in a cameo appearance (he also provides the voice for the Hulk) and even the late Bill Bixby who shows up in a brief clip from TV`s \\"The Courtship of Eddie`s Father.\\"<br /><br />The controversy over which of the two \\"Hulk\\" films is better (i.e. more faithful to the spirit of the original) is sure to rage on for years to come.  I have no real desire to either enter the fray or belabor the point (I like them both about equally), but let me just say that this latest \\"Hulk\\" is really all about the action and, for the most part, it delivers on that level.  But thanks to Norton and Tyler, like the Lee version, it has some much-needed soul as well.from TV`s \\"The Courtship of Eddie`s Father.\\"      The controversy over which of the two \\"Hulk\\" films is better (i.e. more faithful to the spirit of the original) is sure to rage on for years to come.

B00068TJM6|5.0|Es un muy bonito reloj, con la precisión y el prestigio de Seiko. El pulso es bien grueso, se ve bien en una muñeca robusta. El segundero amarillo y los números en la corona le dan un aire deportivo y a la vez elegante sin quitarle su elegancia. El sistema de broche de seguridad es fácil de manejar y muy seguro.  Es un gran reloj por ese precio.
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|This is a phenomenal CD of fabulous music with two of the greatest \\"Jazz men\\" of all time.  Probably the single greatest CD I have added to my collection in years.  Crisp, on time, and deep melodies as well as the perfect duo make this CD worth the money and probably one of the first I will wear out.
0312360266|4.0|This is great.  Similar concept as Harry Potter but vampires.  It might not be as well written as Harry Potter, but I think it is more intriguing, but that could be that I am a vampire fan.
