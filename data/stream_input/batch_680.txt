0517223546|5.0|That's what blows me away when I go to Europe - the rich sense of history and the lost day-to-day details.  I kept flipping back to earlier chapters to remind myself of the evolution of the area, the buildings, and the families. <br /> <br />This isn't one of those \\"epic, generational\\" things where the paperback has all these faces on it and the back cover reads dramatically using words like \\"sweeping saga of history.\\"  It's just a generational, evolutionary, progression of family story lines that you can't put down! <br /> <br />The research is painstaking.  Ummm - okay, a few places I skipped pages because it got to be too much like a history book, but nevertheless, it puts things rather eerily in perspective of just how much time has passed.  I can't wait to read his book \\"London.\\"

1593353006|5.0|Terry Goodkind does it again. Great continuation of the Sword of Truth story. The MP3 version was great. No loss in quality. Only three CDs. Very small storage space required. Case was the size of a DVD.  <br />
B000N6UERK|4.0|I watched the blu-ray version of this film, and the picture is stunning. Color saturation, black levels and sheer image crispness make this movie one of the finest i've seen yet on blu-ray. As for the movie's story it's pretty simple. Washington is an atf-agent sent to investigate a bombing aboard a New Orleans ferry where he meets Val Kilmer's character. Kilmer's an fbi agent who is in charge of a top secret \\"surveilance\\" project assined to this case as well. It's pretty clear early on that there is going to be some time travel in this flick, especially with a title like \\"Deja-vu\\". But the director knows how implausible this premise is, and tries hard to pull the viewer into the emotional side of this bombing first. This works with a lot of help from Washington's conviction to a beautiful victim of the attack...or is she? All the little clues of her death & the case in general don't add up. This combined with Denzel's performance makes the viewer care. It makes us want to stop this thing before it ever happens. I could empathize with Washington's desperation to try anything to help the girl, and of course stop this 'terrorist attack'. It's at this point where the film draws you into the techincal side of how Kilmer's fbi-team accidentally figured out a way to witness the crime scene before it actually happens...hmm. Anyhow, there are some nifty action pieces a lot of which revolve around the premise that all the events leading up to the attack are intertwined. True, there are a few times where whats happening onscreen can be a little confusing. That's okay. The movie-goer is supposed to be in a flux at these times. It's all going somewhere, so don't overthink it. One could endlessly analyze all of the parallels of time-travel until...well, the end of time, (ha-ha)...instead, just roll with the premise of this film, and have fun. It's a typical good-guy/bad-guy action movie, but with a fresh approach to the genre.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Somewhere in the liner notes it says that \\"the Beatles\\"  listened to Pet Sounds, then wrote \\"SGT Pepper\\", i don't hear any revamping of style other than some already present harmonies. I like \\"Pet Sounds\\" better. <br />Too many moving lyrics and harmonies, for me nothing can ever beat the Lyric to \\"Caroline, no\\". \\" Oh, Caroline you. What timeing! <br />I do try to imagine while listening, what the \\"Beatles\\" were experiencing, i come up with admiration and respect for a truly American sound, without the 1,4,5, progression. <br />Nice also that the cd offers the entire album in both MONO and re-mastered STEREO

B000003CMB|4.0|I purchased this album to replace the one on LP. If you are a person who enjoys true  southern rock , you shouldn't be without a copy of this one. Some of this work is at a level you will never hear again. Absolutely superb!

B000E41MRC|5.0|As a high school history teacher, I attempt to lead my students through the process of trying to understand the humanness of history: asking questions such as 'Why would the German people so gladly follow [...]?' and 'What was the appeal of Nazism?' Using this film (excerpts, especially the intro series and the youth rally), I find that students begin to process the growth and appeal of [...] Germany in a new way as well as discussing the ability to be manipulated by media and how we may be equally affected by it in today's society. The reviews below describing the content and quality of the work in detail are excellent--I just wanted to offer feedback about the beneficial use of the film in the classroom.
6305897786|3.0|The premise of this film was intriguing, it just got lost in too many long scenes.  Depp's acting was flat and the direction seemed off.  Not one of his best by a long shot.
0670034711|1.0|I couldn't wait to read this book. I'm a yoga teacher, spiritual seeker, and an avid reader. I love to read about travel, food, spirituality...this book promised to deliver them all. <br /> <br />I cannot tell you how HORRIBLY dissapointed I was!!!! Not only did I waste an hour and a half thumbing through it, but I was smarting from the loss of 16 dollars plus whatever shipping.  <br /> <br />The writer comes off as a holier-than-thou Sex and the City character...she prattles on and ON about men and God in the same air-headed fashion. She embodies perfect example of the pseudo-spiritual New York woman...toting her yoga mat everywhere,shopping for the perfect yoga \\"accessories\\", spending ridiculous amounts of money on \\"spiritual\\" retreats, innocently patronizing other cultures from her pedestal of spoiled suburban comfort. <br /> <br />Oh yeah... and what's with all the creepy homage to the Siddha yogis(Gurumayi and Muktananada)? She left out the part about all of the child molestation that took place in that ashram too. Guess it just slipped her mind. <br /> <br />Why did this book get reviewed so well? Are people just that stupid now? <br /> <br />It's not even that entertaining, folks. Just plain boring, untalented prose. You would be better off reading a copy of Cosmo. Seriously.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|I thought my highschool experience was action packed.  It was nothing compared to the kids' in this film.  I love Gordon-Levitt, and this film was great.  Creepy, funny, and amazingly well done.

B000MCH5P4|5.0|I saw the film in cinema, but I needed it for my DVD collection as this film is a must. Excellent entertainment.
B000793BG4|5.0|I cannot begin to tell you how great this cd is. But if you are looking at this you already know that. What you do need to know is the extra cost for the Deluxe Tour Edition is well worth it. The hardcore fans will froth at the addition of the videos but which really makes the cd for all levels of fandom is the addition of three excellent songs. Glamorous Indie Rock n Roll is a superb b side that should have made the final cut to the original album. These extra features are not just addons they really feal as though they are apart of the album flow.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series deserves 6 stars, it's so amazing! With new film technology and innovative, unafraid approaches to dangerous and unusual areas, the BBC really packs a punch with this breath-taking set of DVDs. See the world like you've never seen it before! See animals do things we never would've thought possible! Fish that live in acidic water strong enough to melt metal, snakes that can snatch bats out of the air mid-flight, octopi that 'walk' on the ocean floor... there's just so much to see, you can watch it again and again.
B000002H6C|5.0|James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich have explained that they did not like the production on \\"...And Justice for All.\\"  I agree that the rhythm guitar and drum tracks dominate the entire record, but I still hold this album as one of my favorites in the entire Metallica catalog.   <br /> <br />The album, simply put, is ferocious from start to finish.  I appreciate Metallica's ability to incorporate melody into heavy metal and they accomplish this wonderfully on the album.  The complexity of the song structures and the numerous tempo changes compliment their musical ability and illustrate their actual musicianship.  Rather than being just a bunch of guys who can play loud and fast, Metallica prove they can actually play their instruments with this offering. <br /> <br />My only complaint with the albums is the fact that it underscores Jason Newsted's amazing bass playing.  While he simply plays the same cords as Hetfield's rhythm, his bass is still there, lumbering on and providing the \\"umph\\" to each track.  I attribute this to him testing out the waters in a new band and was delighted to see him stray from this technique on the \\"Black\\" album.  Nonetheless, he was an important member of the band for 14 years and what he brought to the band should not be overlooked. <br /> <br />While most of the songs are more than five minutes, they do not end up being repetitious like songs on \\"St. Anger.\\"  Each offers a complex, constantly-changing structure that keeps the attention of the listener.  Each song has the ability to stand on its own, but \\"Harvester of Sorrow,\\" \\"Blackened,\\" \\"The Shortest Straw,\\" and \\"Eye of the Beholder\\" are especially great tracks.  The song \\"One\\" is in a category of its own, having been Metallica's first commercial hit, but is certainly not the only great song on the album.  <br /> <br />While plagued by poor production, \\"...And Justice for All\\" is still an excellent album in Metallica's arsenal and offers a phenomenal listening experience to any fan.   <br/>
B000002BBY|5.0|There's a hackneyed saying, \\"Time will tell.\\" But cliches are often cliches for a reason. There's truth to them. Case in point, \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\" I just listened to it for the first time in ten years, and, well, I love it, all over again. How many albums can you say that about? Certainly not Born in the USA.<br /><br />What makes this album so great? Simple. Every song is good. Some, like the micro epic closer, Champagne Supernova, are classic. I just wish the jamming guitar solo would go on for another 10 minutes, but that's okay. And if maybe some of the other songs took off in that balls-to-the-wall sort of way. No? That's okay, too.<br /><br />The only song I'd skip is one of their most popular, Wonderwall. I don't know. It just feels droany and whiny. But it's still good. That's what this album is all about (even that song that's just a clip of a jam is worth it). It's like they could do nothing wrong. If only they stayed that way. Oh well.<br /><br />Just a warning. Don't ever, I mean ever, listen to an interview with them. Promise? Seriously. It's like if you were into Lenny Kravitz and all of a sudden heard him say that he enjoys clubbing Harp Seals and strangling kittens. That's why I try not to read tell-all biographies. If someone's an artist, just let their art speak for them. Not their misguided words.<br /><br />Most of all, sit back and enjoy the Brit invasion album in 30 years. And no, they're not better than the Beatles. Just a little different. And a lot more obnoxious.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|The collaboration with Rick Rubin pays off.  This CD is terrific and listenable.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Linkin Park is one of my favorite bands, from their demo EP under the band name \\"Hybrid Theory,\\" to their standout sophomore effort, \\"Meteora.\\" As such, it's difficult to wait 3-4 years between releases, but the results usually yield something special. <br /> <br />\\"Minutes to Midnight\\" is not the case. In short, this Rick Rubin-produced debacle embraces reinvention where none was necessary. So rap-rock is dead? Has that ever stopped LP before from doing their own thing, from collaborations with The X-cutioners to Jay-Z? Wherein their last albums were passionate and cohesive, \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" is, dare I say, completely un-redeeming. <br /> <br />Case in point: Though this may sound prudish, Bennington and Shinoda used to pen lyrics sans cursing. And they could get away with it because the content was so passionate that it conveyed enough emotion to forgo statements like, \\"What the **** is wrong with me?!\\" This, coupled with an endless succession of songs curried from what could be a new, low form of depressing rock ballads, makes for the worst material the band has ever produced. <br /> <br />If I were to write an open letter to Linkin Park it would say simply this: Be yourselves, guys, and go back to doing what you do best. (And fire Rick Rubin.)
B0001HAISG|4.0|I saw Peter Pan when i was a little boy, and it stirred my imagination soo<br /><br />much that i dreamed that i was actually flying with Peter.<br /><br />No movie could ever match what i saw and from that day i would not view<br /><br />any new Peter Pan movie....till now<br /><br />  I have seen this Peter Pan movie, and it keeps up with the old and even<br /><br />better cause its live action.  Peter is great, the captain is still mean<br /><br />and dark as he should be.  Can be viewed multiple time..
B00005MP58|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this series. I have seen different versions of Pride and Prejudice and I have liked all of them for different reasons. <br />When I say that it is better than I expected it's because I have become eskeptical over things that are praised too much. I tend to not like them as much as reviewers or critics or even friends rave over them. This however is in my opinion, very good.  <br />I recomend it to everyone who likes the book,works by Jane Austen , other versions of Pride and Prejudice and of course who likes Colin Firth (pretty good performance).
B00007GZQZ|5.0|This is one of my very favorite movies ever.  Whether the critics liked it or not, if you own a home, you will get a kick out of this movie.  If you don't own a home, watch it anyway because Tom Hanks and Shelly Long are hilarious.  We have found ourselves quoting one-liners from it on many occasions.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Breathtaking is truly the only word that describes this album as a whole. It's one of the most stunning and beautiful albums i've ever heard, and I don't even understand a single word that's sung! There's not a single bad track on this album, each song makes you not only feel as if you're in Iceland watching the sunrise, but such uplifting, spiritual emotion. Sigur Ros might not be considered \\"easy listening\\" to those who are new to them...but once you hear this album, you just don't give a damn. Their music speaks volumes, you FEEL what they're saying, not what they're saying. This album is one of the best albums ever, once again showing how Icelanders sure know how to play their music.
0060594896|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It has great insights into how to live a better, more productive and happy life. I will definately read it again as it has so much information that you need to review it and use it as a reference book.  I am gradually putting what I have learned to use.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B00005JLCI|2.0|I've seen three versions of Hamelt, this version if I must give a rating is a 2 star at best, without a doubt the best version of Hamlet is the Mel Gibson version. Basically he made me understand Hamlet and the old world language with the way he pertrayed the broken hearted Dane Price, He injected passion into the role of Hamlet to the point where I could then say \\" Oh ok I get it now \\"
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Like others have said before me, I loved Meteora and Hybrid Theory.  Those Albums were good times and this album is just... meh.   <br />It doesn't compare to their great albums before it. <br />It's even a little, dare i say, boring? <br /> <br />I just hope that Linkin Park learns from this and makes the awesome CD that we can all feel coming.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|As with many Linkin Park Fans, I was expecting and to a certain degree hoping Minutes to Midnight to much like there Freshman and Sophomore Albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora.  From the beginning of the first full track you quickly realize that that is not going to be the case.  <br /> <br />A few observations and thoughts. <br />1. Linkin Park has changed directions musically - As some other people have said Linkin Park owned the Rock-Rap fusion genre and with this album they have placed themselves in the Alternative Rock Genre with many other great bands.  Not that this is necessarily a bad thing but they have definitely gotten rid of that which made them unique or at least subdued it to the point of being indistinguishable.  <br /> <br />2. Minutes to Midnight is lacking focus - I applaud bands that challenge themselves musically and experiment with different sounds, however, there is no apparent consistency to the album.  It appears that they were playing with a bunch of different sounds and feels and decided to throw a bit of everything into this album.  To me that is both a good thing and a bad thing.  No one can say that all the songs on this album sound the same but at the same time one of the things I liked most about their previous albums is how the whole album flowed together almost seamlessly. This album seems a bit disjointed to me. <br /> <br />3. The Lyrics ROCK - One of the things I love most about Linkin Park is the Lyrics and that hasn't changed.  I am partial to bands that have something to say that I deem as significant and in that regard Linkin Park has outdone themselves on this album.  You still have the Introspective Songs that strike a cord with almost everyone and as an added bonus to me you also get some very direct politically charged assaults on many controversial issues. <br /> <br />For me my love for Linkin Parks music was based generically on one thing....Their PASSION......and that hasn't changed.  The sound is definitely different and not exactly what I was hoping for or expecting in that regard but Linkin Park is still Linkin Park.  It is going to take me some time to get used to the new sound but Passion for what you do musically will always prevail and in that manner Linkin Park has prevailed just as well as on previous albums. <br />
B000OCXFCO|5.0|This album starts right, with a great name, best in whole Deth's career, it's almost worth the 12 bucks alone. But it also continues right, since this is the best Megadeth release since the Countdown/Youthanasia era. And talking about those 2 discs, I find that Abominations fits exactly in their middle in terms of style, despite the press-releases and some reviews here. <br /> <br />What you see in Abominations is a mix of: 1) tons of inteligent, hooky, captivating and sometimes even cheesy vocal lines - probably Mustaine's best ever - that we saw in Countdown (remember Skin o'my teeth, Sweating Bullets, Foreclosure of a Dream, etc.); 2) those nice catching melodies that abounded on Youthanasia and Countdown; 3) lots of fast, melodic but aggressive solos that are placed everywhere, before the chorus, after the chorus, etc. like we had in RIP and Countdown; 4) a few well-positioned, interesting variations that we saw on Cryptic Writings; 5) Aggressive, full of hatred and indignation lyrics about war and politics, like we had from Peace Sells to Rust, and in System.  <br /> <br />The band is strong, cohese, and the compositions are prime Deth stuff, like the old times. There's attitude, there's poise. Very few classic bands managed to come back to their signature style without sounding dated, like Mustaine's crew have done here. Abominations is no better than Peace, RIP and Countdown, but it does not let down metal fans. It's like Maiden's Somewhere in Time compared to Powerslave. <br /> <br />About the songs, Washington Is Next, with its very melodic guitars, awesome vocal lines and long chorus, is the best song here, already a classic, and that could well be on Countdown. Sleepwalker starts slow, but its a great opener, also showing lots of melody and catching singing. United Abominations and Amerikhastan practically have Mustaine speaking the lyrics, like in a protest, the first one is more melodic, the second a little more modern metal but no worries there, both very good. Gears of War is very aggressive, lots of riffing, a whispered chorus, great. The other new songs are also quite good, and any could be played live w/o problems. <br /> <br />And the A Tout Le Monde version with Lacuna Coil's singer (by far the hottest woman in metal's history) is good, but not as the original, which is THE benchmark for metal ballads. Cristina's singing fit quite well, but the song is played faster than before, which takes the emotion and desperation that Mustaine used to put in there with his unique voice. But a very bad version from any Megadeth song here is WAY better than a very good version from any Metallica's Saint Anger song. <br /> <br />The system has not failed and Deth will not rust in peace. Start the countdown to buying it.
B00005JPFH|1.0|I loved the first 2 spiderman movies.  My girlfriend and I saw them both in the theatres.  So when this one came out we were all agag about seeing it in the theatre.  Last night we went.  Well, we liked it at first, but then it got more violent.  Tobey Maguire seems to have lost his talent!  Why would they jazz up the comic strips and turn Spiderman into a criminal?  Three quarters of the way through the movie, I grabbed my girlfriend's arm and said \\"let's get out of here.\\"  My advice to viewers is avoid this one at all cost.  Just watch Spideman 1, and consider yourself as having seen all three.
B000002ADT|5.0|So much has been said about this LP that I will only say that it is one of the handful of LPs (discs nowadays) you can confidently use to introduce a novice to the world of jazz. This, like Herbie Hancock's Maiden Voyage and Art Blakey's Album of the Year (featuring Wynton Marsalis)will have them coming down the aisle to accept Jazz into thier musical lives. If you could only name 10 Lps as defining Jazz, this would undoubtedly be the easiest one to incldue on that list.
B000059QYB|4.0|In the world of pop artists inspired by punk and new wave, Billy Idol is certainly above average.  He didn't have nearly enough good songs to do toe-to-toe with Duran Duran or Depeche Mode, but the guy definitely had six strong singles that stand the test of time, and this album is worth having because you can find them all here.  Dancing With Myself.  White Wedding.  Rebel Yell.  Cradle of Love.  Eyes Without a Face.  Flesh for Fantasy.  You'll find everyone of the greats, as well as his Mony Mony cover, which was also pretty successful.<br /><br />Those songs along make this album a must-have if you like eighties music. But wait--there's more.  Also with the album you get an acoustic, live version of Rebel Yell.  That might sound scary, but it's actually not half bad.<br /><br />On the other hand, you get Billy attempting to cover \\"LA Woman\\" by the Doors.  No matter what you are imagining in your head, I promise you that it's worse.  But it's worse in all the best ways--like a terrible movie that you watch over and over with your friends so you can make jokes about the diabolical acting, ridiculous plot twists, and run-of-the-mill dialog and action.  Everyone should own this cover of \\"LA Woman\\" so you can break it out at parties and have a laugh with your friends.  Equally atrocious--Idol takes a shot at \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\" (originally recorded by Simple Minds for the movie \\"The Breakfast Club.\\")  While it's not a full on train wreck, it's pretty bad and good for a laugh when you're down in the dumps.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|The Bond franchise starts over with this film, which stars fair-haired Daniel Craig as an inexperienced rookie earning his \\"00\\" status. The plot? To rid an African terrorist group of its funding, Bond takes on its evil banker in a high-stakes poker game at a Bahamas casino. Along the way he learns discipline, patience, and yes, how to judge a good martini.<br /><br />In fact, though the film has a definite modern feel, it contains many classic 007 touches. Though he starts off in a Ford, Bond soon finds himself driving a vintage Aston Martin, and later gets to wreck a brand-new one. When he tells his assistant (Eva Green) her secret identity, he jokes that \\"you are now known as 'Miss Stephanie Broadchest'\\" (\\"I am not!\\" she protests). And yes, guys, there's eye candy -- a bikini-clad babe once pops out of the sea, while another bounces down the beach as she rides a horse -- both for no apparent reason whatsoever.<br /><br />Trouble is, none of this is especially memorable. The girls are rarely seductive, and few and far between. The movie is based on Ian Fleming's 1953 novel, but the plot has been reworked to focus on the redial capability of cell phones, a mundane story device if there ever was one. The chase scenes are creative enough but offer little spectacular scenery. And though it's interrupted a couple of times, the poker game drags on for a full 32 minutes, with nary a bouncy babe in sight. In fact, the whole movie is way too long, especially the final third.<br /><br />Actually, my favorite part of the film is its gorgeous title sequence, which combines the art of  playing cards and roulette wheels with graphic silhouettes of Bond and his enemies. And I really like Judi Dench, reprising her role as the long-suffering M. Also good are two 25-minute bonus features. \\"Becoming Bond\\" recounts Craig's selection and preparation for the role with lots of behind the scenes footage, while \\"James Bond: For Real\\" shows how many of the stunts used a surprisingly little amount of CGI.<br /><br />In the end, this is a good popcorn movie, but it won't be a classic. Craig's youth and solid acting make him a fine choice for the new Bond, but he needs a better writer -- and editor -- to become the next Sean Connery.end, this is a good popcorn movie, but it won't be a classic.

0345363132|5.0|This was my first time to read Sharon Kay Penman. She's the best. The other reviews will tell you about the story. I'm just wanting to brag on the writer. This was her first novel which is set in 15th century England. Next she wrote a trilogy about 13th century England and Wales, Here Be Dragons, Falls the Shadow, and The Reckoning. They should be read in that order. I hope this review is helpful. I look forward to reading all of Sharon's books.
B000MTPAHW|1.0|Not to offend anyone who liked this film, but I simply couldn't find anything inherently good about it. Except for the car chase, but then again, couldn't the two villains have had some sort of dialog! For the entire car chase the two don't utter a word! Unbelievable.  <br /> <br />Bad script and wooden acting = bad movie. <br /> <br />The movie came out in '68, one year after I was born and I had always heard great things about the chase scene, but to me this alone doesn't warrant purchasing this film. Sorry. <br /> <br />Should have bought the SD-DVD! I should add that the transfer was pretty good.
0440234743|5.0|I am an avid reader and not of just one author.  John Grisham books are on my booklist but I read just about everyone at one point or another. If I am not engaged by the first few pages in any book I pick up, and held so thoughout the story, I don't waste my time with the rest of the book.  The Testament grabbed me from the first page and held my interest all the way through to the end.  It was a page-turner for me.  What I liked about the story was that I developed definite feelings about the characters even though Grisham did not say a lot about them other than their antics and a bit of background here and there.  Grishman was very good at creating characters that a reader will care about (or not care for).  The other thing I liked was that the story was transformational on various levels and not just for the lead character.  Nate O'Riley, the alcoholic, drug addicted, constant rehab dwelling attorney, was a character that I truely appreciated getting to know.  I enjoyed watchin him as he passed through life-tests that he sometimes failed and sometimes conqured.  Even with Rachel Lane, who you did not know much about at all, you got a good depth of her personality through Nate's observations of her.  Lastly, the story talks about what a lot of money can do to people, how it corrupts, blinds, and befuddles a sane mind into doing insane things with it.  But it also told the reader through more than one character that it's hard to blame people for how they deal with money because of how they were brought to it.  It's a very thoughtful read and I would recommend The Testament to anyone who enjoys a good read and a good mystery that has a very unpredictable ending.

B00000DG1R|4.0|If you're considering this CD, I probably don't have to introduce you to Duran Duran--but just in case you somehow got amnesia (or were born after 1985), I'll give you the quick synopsis.  If you were to put all the eighties, mainstream, cheesy yet still a little bit artsy bands into some sort of battle of the bands competition, Duran Duran would finish in the top 3 (along with Depeche Mode and the Pet Shop Boys), edging out other favorites like Billy Idol, Tears for Fears, and the Human League.  Without a doubt they were a pop band--not to be confused with artists like the Talking Heads or Blondie--but they were an EXCELLENT pop band who put together 3 (maybe even 4) really good albums and an impressive string of great, sing-a-long singles.  And that's a resume with which few can compete.<br /><br />As for this collection, it's all the Duran Duran a person needs--and maybe even then some.  Every single one of hits are here--including their James Bond song, \\"A View to a Kill,\\" and early nineties hits like \\"Come Undone.\\"  You might have some gripes about which versions they use (for example, why the US edit for \\"Rio?\\"), but you can't argue with the track list as a whole. You've got all the smash hits (Rio, Hungry Like the Wolf, Girls on Film), as well as the popular tracks that aren't as well known (All She Wants Is, New Moon on Monday, The Reflex).  This is a great collection for anyone who's a fan of eighties music or a Duran Duran lover.
074356619X|5.0|I watch the DVD the 1st day it came out.  I have read the book.  The 4CD set is excellent way to review all the valuable information,being able to listen in the car or playing before I go to sleep.  It gives excellent examples of how the secret works.  I learned something from all, the DVD, the book and the CD's. The CD's are easy to listen to almost anytime or anywhere, alot of information is given, this is one book you will listen to over and over again.  Well worth the investment.
6305263248|5.0|I agree with previous positive reviews.  This film met little commercial success in theaters, but it seems to have grown legs in DVD release, enough to warrant a special edition 2-disc release. It deserves it.  Great film for all the aforementioned reasons.
B000002L3P|3.0|Shepherd is reminiscent of the great Stevie Ray Vaughan, and therefore makes Stevie's fans yearn for the real deal. This makes a review by a confirmed SRV fan somewhat suspect and potentially unfair to Kenny Wayne, who is an accomplished blues guitarist - just not in Vaughan's class.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|Wilco returns to the sweet, country-tinged sound of their early work on this release. Fans of YHF and Ghost may lament the absence of the sonic experimentation that worked quite well on those albums, but the band recognized that they would have sounded out of place here. What we have instead are 12 well-written, expertly executed performances that mirror vintage pop but still manage to sound cutting edge. \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" could have easily been released in 1977. <br /> <br />And how about Nels Cline? His playing may be a bit exaggerated at times, but he's a perfect musical foil for Jeff Tweedy's plaintive style. This album is indeed the perfect soundtrack for warm summer evenings. <br />
B000P6R6X8|5.0|I am not always one who buys the cd/dvd package when it costs more than just the cd because some bands string together some things on the dvd's that are complete [...]. That is not the case of this DVD. I was actually surprised by how beautifully it was shot and then at the end of the DVD I saw why it was because of Brendan Canty formerly of Fugazi. Brendan also had a lot to do with Jeff's solo DVD Sunken Treasure. If you don't think these songs will sound great live then you should hear these songs played live on the DVD they are incredible. Impossible Germany I have heard live last year on tour and Walken as well. I prefer the live version of Walken because I think it becomes a great rock song played live. I have had a chance to listen to the album several more times now and it is amazing to me that Wilco has been able to do two  consistent things over the years and that is make great albums each time out and also piss off a portion of their fanbase every time out. I have seen some reviews on here and in some magazines about this album and I agree with some and some not so much. Does this album sound like a Grateful Dead album? I only hear two songs that sound like the Dead to me and that is Side With The Seeds and Sky Blue Sky. Shake It Off to me sounds like a Pink Floyd song to a certain degree to me. The real gem on this album though is the song that closes the album On and On and On. For those who may not now Jeff lost his mother last year and this song was written for his dad. For those who say that the lyrics on this album are not that great then I suggest you listen to the lyrics in this song very closely they are probably some of the most heartfelt lyrics that Tweedy has ever written.
0790749858|5.0|This is a classic!  Fun for all ages.  I truly enjoyed it and hope that you will enjoy it as well.
B000NA2776|5.0|With 2 more song than french CD (one of th two is one of the best of the album), I prefer this version. An excellent first album. Different styles but one perfection ;) Buy this CD, Mika is the revelation of this year!
B00004WG2F|5.0|The beauty of the countryside in this movie is magnificent. The Rocky Mountains of Montana in the early 1900s must have offered challenging experiences as people wrestled with the elements. <br /> <br />The movie is the story of a man, played by Anthony Hopkins, who has three sons and is abandoned by his wife. So he sets out to raise these three boys and at some point writes to his wife to say... I know how to guide men through war, but this is much harder... <br /> <br />Anthony Hopkins plays the role of Colonel Ludlow, discharged from the war because he wanted to regain some sanity. Therefore, he hates government, he despises the drive to conquer and fight over land, and is highly protective of Indians. <br /> <br />This family of men lives out in the wilderness, therefore, nature is the chisel that forms the character of the three boys. They are very close and the oldest two, played by Brad Pitt and Aidan Quinn, are extremely caring and protective of their younger brother, played by Henry Thomas. <br /> <br />The younger son goes away to college and there he meets Susanna, played by Julia Ormond [played Princess Guinevere in the movie First Knight]. He falls in love with her and upon returning home, brings her along to meet the family. <br /> <br />As she enters the life of these lonely men, she captures the heart of each and everyone. The father is delighted that a refined lady has joined them because thanks to her they read, sing, and enjoy the feminine side of life. But... the three brothers soon encounter the difficulties of jealousy, envy, betrayal and competition for the same woman. <br /> <br />Brad Pitt, as usual, plays the role of the man who breaks other people's relationships, breaks hearts all around, but his performance is superb as Tristan... the favorite son. <br /> <br />Don't miss it! A 1994 Academy winner for best cinematography, this movie offers the passionate journey into the darkest secrets of love, betrayal, and families. <br /> <br /> <br/>
B000OCXMAE|3.0|If you like Linkin Park, it's worth a shot.  I would dare say to go to iTunes and only pick and choose ones you like though.  The CD overall doesn't give you what you'd hope to expect LP to deliver. <br /> <br />Some of the more enjoyable songs are the slower-paced ones (Leave Out All the Rest, Shadow of the Day).  They do get a bit more political than they've been before, which to me is just lame.  I'd rather not hear songs complaining about people dying in Iraq. It's tragic, I know, but it's becoming a cliche these days. <br /> <br />Overall, half of the songs are pretty decent, with the other half leaving you wanting.
0811806405|4.0|I found the book to be very helpful with the setup of a new giutar i assembled and hope to build the steel string in the book.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|This CD is lowest-common denominator turd, and definitely not up to par with Meteora or Hybrid Theory. Linkin Park is trying to be \\"cool\\" by cussing in a couple of songs, but it just makes them seem more pathetic. The rapping, which was one of Linkin Park's best attributes, is almost absent on this CD, and it seems they have just become another emo band. It does get one star for making me laugh once (the lyrics to Valentine's Day made me howl so hard I almost fell off my chair: I never knew what it was like / to be alone on a Valentine's Day,). Seriously, quit whining Chester, nobody cares; quit writing emo music and grow up. <br /> <br />The worst album of 2007 thus far.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Linkin Park is finally back. I just bought the album through Itunes and i love it. After Linkin Park made that album with JZ the band was dead to me. It was horrible. But this new album made me change my mind.  <br /> <br />This album is AMAZING. I love it. Everyone knows Linkin Park by its unique style. They finally brought that back to this album. Deft. worth my money.
B00009L1TA|4.0|I need to provide some backstory on my viewing experience of John McTiernan's 2003 military thriller \\"Basic\\". Is there such a thing as a \\"military thriller\\"? Ah, never mind. Anyway, I rented a copy of \\"Basic\\" and let it sit on the DVD player for a few days before I got around to watching it. Big mistake. Between the time when I picked up the disc and when I popped it in the player, I came down with a serious cold. I'm talking a SERIOUS cold. The type of cold that makes you wish they sold Kleenex by the metric ton. The sort of cold where you breathe through your mouth because your nasal passages feel like someone packed them full of cement with a cannon ramrod. I did the only sane thing a person could do: I loaded up with cold medication. Cough syrup, aspirin, anti-histamines, cough drops, nasal spray--you name it, I was taking it by the handfuls. The resulting effect of my medicinal intake, I must say, can only be described as kaleidoscopic. I felt like my head had turned into a balloon filled with laughing gas. It was in this state of mind that I viewed \\"Basic\\".<br /><br />That was a big mistake, as we'll see shortly. \\"Basic\\" begins by showing us a routine military training mission in the jungles of Panama. Amidst a raging hurricane, Sergeant Nathan West (Samuel L. Jackson) runs his team of Army Rangers ragged. He's a tough guy, as tough as a steel pipe, and all of the members of his squad despise him. Then a tragedy unfolds out in the jungle, a tragedy that claims the life of West and several other members of the squad. Only two survive, in fact. In order to figure out what happened, the Army brings in crack investigator Tom Hardy (John Travolta) to solve the mystery. Tom's an ex-Ranger and a DEA agent currently under investigation for unethical behavior. The base's commander and Hardy's pal Styles (Tim Daly) teams Tom up with a southern belle, Lieutenant Osborne (Connie Nielsen), and the two start interrogating the first survivor, Dunbar (Brian Van Holt). Tom's a whiz at questioning suspects, and he gets Dunbar's story--which we see unfold in flashback--in quick order. It's a weird tale about murder and mayhem out in the jungle. Of course, several details don't really match up with the facts, so Hardy and Osborne must move on to the next survivor.<br /><br />Kendall (Giovanni Ribisi) lies in a hospital bed recovering from his injuries when our two heroes show up to start the questioning. His story, which we also see in flashback, differs from Dunbar's tale of woe in significant ways. As Hardy and Osborne begin to examine the threads winding their way through the two stories, they uncover more than they bargained for. They keep going back and forth between the two, Dunbar and Kendall, trying to pry more information out of them after confronting each one with their inconsistencies. Most alarmingly, Kendall suddenly dies in his hospital bed after bleeding out of every orifice in his head. Is this an attempt by someone or several someones to get him to shut up? Yes, yes it is. It can't be Dunbar because he's still locked up in another room on the base. Could it have something to do with one of the base physicians, Dr. Vilmer (Harry Connick, Jr.)? Maybe Colonel Styles knows more than he's letting on. He's Hardy's friend, but that doesn't mean he shares everything with him. Heck, what about Osborne? She seems like a straight arrow, but she couldn't get Dunbar to talk (which necessitated the arrival of Hardy). Maybe that was all an act to hide something.<br /><br />I'm not going forward with more plot points because I don't want to spoil the film for you. Not that I could, mind you, since \\"Basic\\" ranks highly on my \\"Most Confusing and Convoluted Films Ever to Emerge from Hollywood\\" list. McTiernan and writer James Vanderbilt offer the viewer so many flashback scenarios, red herrings, and numerous plot twists that my head started hurting. Even more confusing was the tendency to tell further stories in the middle of flashbacks. Ouch! I just bailed on the story, blew my nose a couple of times, and tried to focus on things that made sense, like the performances. They're good. Travolta plays smart aleck pretty well, and Sam Jackson knows how to play an overbearing jerk. Connie Nielsen does an acceptable job, but that southern accent has to go, like, yesterday! It's nice to see Tim Daly in a major motion picture, and Giovanni Ribisi goes over the top as Kendall. The movie's atmosphere works well for such a murky murder mystery/conspiracy story, but the wind and crashing rain tend to drown out the dialogue. I was always fiddling with the volume control trying to understand what the characters were saying. I fiddled in vain.<br /><br />I highly recommend you don't watch \\"Basic\\" while under the influence of cold medicine. A confusing film like this one becomes nearly unwatchable on Nyquil and anti-histamines. Having said that, I actually like it enough to give it four stars. I enjoy watching Italian murder mysteries called giallo, which often achieve heights of confusion more labyrinthine in execution than what \\"Basic\\" offered, so it's all to the good. The DVD version of the film offers us several extras, none of them very interesting. We get a boring commentary track with director McTiernan, an extended interview with writer Vanderbilt, and a lengthy lovefest with the actors. You've seen this last supplement a million times. It consists of interviews with the cast where everyone heaps praise on the film and on their fellow actors. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Whatever. If you're feeling adventurous, give \\"Basic\\" a shot. I hope you like it.. Ouch! I just bailed on the story, blew my nose a couple of times, and tried to focus on things that made sense, like the performances. They're good.

B000002552|4.0|this was hard to get ahold of - a shame, because it's a must-listen
B00000254B|5.0|I find it utterly,  amazingly,  unthinkable that ANYone can come up with ONE 'negative' thing to say about this collection by the inimitable Ms Streisand. This CD..this music --- just  transports me....elevates me...changes my mood and outlook......it is an ethereal listening experience..almost religiously hypnotic in its beauty, eloquence, and simplistic beauty. Some of the songs bring a lump to my throat.  It's a joy and a privilege to hear this  Artist render her  vocal and emotional interpretation of these classic aural wonders.........a true gift to the ears. Bravo. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars/ Lisa Guerci in CT
6302000823|3.0|CINEMA PARADISO is one of the most well-loved and talked about Italian films, made in the last twenty years.  I generally hear people speak of CINEMA PARADISO and IL POSTINO in the same breath.  I was completely enamored of IL POSTINO (THE POSTMAN), so I really thought that I would be equally infatuated with this film.  Unfortunately, the combination of melodrama and sleepy direction didn't sustain my attention.  Though, I was completely in love with Marco Leonardi, who plays the more mature version of the protagonist, Salvatore.  Leonardi is also well-known for his role as Pedro Muzquiz, in LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE, the love interest of perpetual cook, Tita (Lumi Cavazos).<br /><br />In CINEMA PARADISO, Salvatore (Leonardi), a well-established filmmaker recounts his formative years as a young boy at the knees of Alfredo (Philippe Noiret), a film projectionist who introduced him to films, and ultimately helped shape the course of his life.  Also, Salvatore has great love for Elena (Agnese Nano), that is ultimately ill-fated.<br /><br />Yes, this sounds great.  Yes, I am the only who doesn't think so.  It's just my opinion.  Honestly, I think you should see it for yourself and decide, but I wouldn't buy a copy today, as readily as I would IL POSTINO and numerous other Italian films that deal with coming of age and romance--one example that comes to mind is Fellini's great AMARCORD.  You be the judge, though.
B00005JPFH|1.0|Where do I begin, I usually have a sixth sense about whether or not a movie is going to be any good and as I have done many times before, I ignored that sense and saw Spider-man 3 on opening day. I can barely begin to describe how bad this movie is when compared to its two predecessors, but I will try. <br />First off, this is supposedly the most expensive film ever made and while the FX are a sight to behold at only a few key moments, they don't impress as much as they would if the typical audience member actually gave a turd about what was happening. <br />Second, there's just way too much going on at once for the audience to have the time it takes to reflect on the events in the story. <br />Third, now I'm not a stickler for a film adaptation of a comic book that takes certain liberties with the original source material, but when a man gets inexplicably transformed into sand and can suddenly fly around the city in a cloud-like formation, or when for some equally unexplained reason a meteorite lands and produces an alien black substance, you're just asking too much of any rational or semi-intelligent movie goer to suspend disbelief of this crap. <br />Fourth, It's equally difficult to suspend disbelief when you're asked to accept that Tobey Maguire can portray a sex symbol while at the same time being asked to endure the vocal stylings of Kirsten Dunst.  <br />In short, this movie is barely better than trash like Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. <br />Despite all of that though, I actually enjoyed seeing this in the theater, souly because the 8 year old boy sitting behind me provided one of the funniest commentary tracks I've heard in years.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I found this product in very good condition and will buy from Amazon again.
0802136834|4.0|After reading all the Philippa Gregory books about Tudor England I became really interested in that period in English history.  I wanted to read some non-fiction so I ordered this after reading all the reviews.  I was afraid it would be a little dry.  Happily it wasn't!!  I found it to be a relatively fast read and very interesting!  My only criticism would be that Anne Boleyn's section of the book was a little long and drawn out.
B00005JKGK|5.0|I saw this film, based on the novel of the same name (written by Amy Tan), several years after it was released in the movie theaters.  It was a suggested film for a Sociology in the Media course, and I can definitely see why it was reccomended.  It's a tearjerker and was beautifully adapted for the screen.  Director Wayne Wang brings the harrowing stories of eight Chinese and Chinese-American women, spanning two generations, together as an epic tale of the turbulence and pain of immigration and assimilation.  The cast includes the wonderful Ming Na (as one of the daughters).<br /><br />This story really takes an honest look at the struggle and sacrifice that immigrants must make, in the face of all odds, to survive and adapt to a new culture, language and set of social expectations.  All the while, in the case of these strong women, they hold strong to their culture through weekly games of mah jong, where they gather together to gossip, give advice and commiserate.  This is a great film, and has been called a \\"chic flick,\\" but I really don't believe that that stereotypical term is fitting of THE JOY LUCK CLUB at all.  It is truly a film for all people.  All people age seventeen and over, that is. There is a reason that this was rated R.  There is intensely graphic and disturbing imagery here, as well as thematic elements that are too much for small children or young teens.
B000EGCITG|5.0|I think this is definately her best album yet.  She has such energy and drive.  I love the great assortment of songs!
B000MNP2KI|3.0|OK. Let me first state that my favorite Bond was Sean Connery. To that point let me advise you to take Casino Royale as its own entity. This is not a Bond movie in the tradition of the tongue-in-cheek quips, sexual romping or suave machismo of the Bonds of the past. It's a rough and gritty film where this Bond character makes more than one mistake, gets in over his head and is a mystifyingly \\"burnt-out\\" after just making the prestigious \\"00\\" status.    Alright, here's where things get confusing if you take this as another James Bond film. It's out of order in the sequence of time with the other films. This is Bond's first adventure the viewer, or reader if you read the books, has with the character. Cool, but this takes place in present day and not in the past. This is why I advise you to discount all other Bond movies. Don't waste your time with the little insights that, I believe, are suppose to \\"flesh-out\\" the character of the other films. It will only add to you unsuccessfully trying to logically fit all the other Bond movies in context. This will get in the way of enjoying what the movie does have to offer the viewer.    I've got to say here that, Caterina Murino, was a knock-out in the truest of Bond girl traditions. We needed more of that in this story. From the, now infamous opening Bond movie credits, we can see there isn't going to be much fun in the sack with this show. By the way, the opening credit graphics are fantastic and don't disappoint from a visual aspect. As stated, the movie takes place contemporarily which accounts for the brutality depicted in the portrayal of the action? The old Bond almost never got his hands dirty. Daniel Craig wallows in one bloody confrontation after another and still manages to tidy up with hardly a cut on him. No bruising or scrapes even though he's just come back from either getting the poop kicked out of him or visa versa. If we all could heel so miraculously!!!     What is there that makes this film worth watching?The action scenes. They are very good, especially the \\"Jackie Chan\\"-style feats at the beginning of the movie. The amazing places where we travel with Bond. A story that shows it's not as easy as the old James Bond's character portrayed being in a job that really sucks. There's not much glamour getting the [...] kicked out of you all the time. And . . . I guess Daniel Craig's performance. I begrudging give credit here because there are times when I can feel some empathy for him and then there are times when there doesn't seem to be much substance to his character. But, he definitely seems like a guy who's rather new at the \\"00\\" job. From my perspective Daniel is not a suave, debonair or even a slightly mistakable smooth operator. Rather he is more the civil savage. Brooding, rugged and definitely VERY rough around the edges. I suppose this is the \\"insight\\" as to how James Bond became the character to come? Like I said, don't try and figure it out in context. The sudden switch in his character from cool killer to love lost schoolboy at the end is also a bit disjointed. You just want to smack him up side the head so he comes back to reality. But, hey, maybe that's why he's a little confused by the end of the movie; too many cracks up side the head?!?!?!?    What's not to like about this picture? The repeated unrealistic physical comebacks of Craig's character. Also, there's not much \\"fun\\" in this film so you're hit with endless struggles. \\"In the old days\\" James Bond had a little pleasure with his business and you dreamed of being \\"James Bond\\". If you dream of being this character you must be a masochist. Eva Green's portrayal of the character Vesper left me rather flat. Mads Mikkelsen's acting of the villain, Le Chiffre, was great but at times you couldn't hear what the heck he was saying. Poor sound?!?!? And lastly, the storyline got a bit foggy at times. It probably could have been streamlined more and it would have made the plot so much more entertaining instead of an on-the-fly self-editing task.    If I took the film as a stand-alone I would say it was a good adult, no sex, adventure. Full of amazing photography and settings. And, with enough of a plot, use your own editing filter when watching, to be an enjoyable viewing.
B000001FO4|5.0|<br />I'm not going to review this whole album because I haven't heard any of the other songs and I'm pretty sure they suck anyway.  But the aforementioned dont know what.... from here on known as DKWYGTIG is great.  It's toucing and emotional and sentimental and its tinged with a tender sadness that puts a lump in my throat everytime I hear it.  Plus the words are so true.  Don't know what you got till its gone... a universal truth.  And its even more powerful because the guy sounds like a muppet but he is still able to evoke a real human sadness.  bravo cinderella.  I could listen to this song all day at work.  you know just put it on repeat and an experience continuous aural oragasm.
B00005GL0Q|5.0|REVOLVER is, quite simply, one of the most beautiful albums, by The Beatles, that I have ever had the pleasure to hear.  Ringo, Paul, John and George are at their best here. The instrumental arrangement is tight, the vocals are smooth and the songs are totally infectious and memorable.  There are a slew of hits, here, including \\"Taxman,\\" \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" \\"Yellow Submarine,\\" \\"Good Day Sunshine,\\" and \\"Got To Get You Into My Life.\\"  The imagery in the lyrics is just great.  If I was really going to analyze all of it, I would need room for a novel, here!  What I will say is that The Beatles' signature combination of quirky irony, poetry, double entendre and clever social commentary is really showcased at its best here.  Awesome!
B000NA1OXY|3.0|I have to aggree with a lot of the other reviews.  I was so excited and was one of the first to run out and buy Avril's new album.  Only to find out that it has a very young, \\"bubblegum pop\\" type of sound.  I'll admit I find some of the songs a little catchy but then find myself just laughing at the lyrics.  Hopefully she'll come out with some \\"older\\" sounding songs on her next album.
B000O75F7C|5.0|\\"In Absentia\\" was the first PT album I got introduced to and I followed up quickly with \\"Deadwing\\". Those two albums are among my favorites ever (and I listen to, enjoy, and buy a lot of music and have done so for decades). So naturally, I was apprehensive about buying \\"Fear...\\" - could PT really follow up with yet another stunner? <br /> <br />When I first listened to it, I immediately realised this was not \\"In Absentia\\", but it gradually dawned on me (after 2 listens) that this was a lot more complex and, ultimately, just as satisfying (gimme a few more months, I might say more satisfying) as \\"In Absentia\\" or \\"Deadwing\\". <br /> <br />If I have a complaint, it's the same as someone else here echoed: the album leaves me wanting more (too short). <br /> <br />For lovers of intelligent rock, do yourselves a big favor and get into Porcupine Tree. And certainly add this gem to your collection. <br /> <br />

B000OCXMAE|2.0|I purchased this album from itunes and instantly regretted doing so. Hybrid Theory was great, and a strong album from that genre. Meteora had good songs, but the length of the album had me questioning how much the band had left in them...I didn't believe their excuse for the length of the album. Apparently they felt a shorter album would make for a more enjoyable listening experience. That concept could not be more true than it is for Minutes to Midnight. Listening to the album, I was reminded of the late eighties to mid-nineties, and not for good reasons. It is an album of rock ballads, a feat that should only be attempted by great musicians. The members of Linkin Park are OK musicians at best, a fact that can and has been hidden by their aggressive, harder music. It's what they're good at, and what they're fans want to hear. Linkin Park has added a bonus track to this album, a live version of What I've Done...oooh. I liked the digitally improved version better. Linkin Park has always been a commercial/corporate band. After their last album, I wondered what their next effort would produce. Now I know...their last album. A very forgettable, and sub par effort.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I really don't know what disappointed me more, Metallica's St. Anger or Linkin Park's Minutes to Midnight.  They really screwed up on this one.  Now I am worried about what Rick is going to do to Metallica's new one due out later this year.  I hope their new one is better than this.  Too much change is just as bad as no change at all. They should have balanced out the songs better.  The best LP new song can heard on YouTube.  In search, type in Linkin Park and Qwerty.  Believe it or not, this song did not make it to the new album.  What the hell were they thinking!!
1582701709|4.0|A family member recommended this book and my husband and I read it.  It is a little redundant in it's passages, but it has A LOT of awesome info, ways to think great things into your life.  The power of positive thinking can change your life.  Everyone should read this small book, packed with powerful suggestions.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Half the songs on the cd sound Hoobastank'ish. <br />If I wanted Hoobastank, I would have purchased a Hoobastank cd.  <br /> <br />Its just too bad we had to wait 4 years for this rip off.  <br />

0385340559|5.0|Jack Reacher, an indestructible giant of a man, doesn't forget his past nor his friends. Being the hardnose corrector of injustice that he is -- a virtual one man band of law enforcement -- one might be surprised to learn that he once led a special investigative team of army MP's before he retired into the aloof, semi-hidden loner we know him to be. But, as our past tends to catch up with us, Reacher is no exception. When a member of that long-ago band of perfect killers for the good side is thrown out of a helicopter after having been tortured, someone wants to contact Reacher... bad! And when he finds a deposit of $1030 in his banking account, the math genius part of his brain recognizes a coded call for urgent contact.<br /><br />The depositor is ex-sergeant, now wealthy Frances Neagley, the first of the squad to learn of their comrade's murder and a fearsome killer in her own right as well as a fully qualified member of the \\"special investigators.\\" It was Reacher who made them special, training his carefully chosen squad in deductive reasoning and ingenious strategizing. The deposit as means of communication is an example of the intellectual standard. The exact amount isn't only the 10 code for \\"crime in progress\\" but includes \\"officer needs help,\\" and \\"danger/caution\\" as well. Coming from a team member he hasn't heard from in years, he takes it as urgent, indeed. And, the sum is the right amount to cover airfare for an L.A. rendezvous. Did she also know he was penniless?<br /><br />In the ensuing exposure of a conspiracy that could wreak great havoc on America, who will be left standing at the end comes down to a small difference in determination.
0767802470|5.0|This movie has a lot of positive aspects and is definetely one <br />of the best war movies ever. <br /> <br />But several reviewers seemed to have found a negative point in this movie: <br />The \\"lack\\" of nazis in the movie, respectively \\"historical revisionism\\". <br /> <br />Let's start my view of this point with a quotation of Hitler: <br />\\"On the land I'm a hero, but on the water a coward.\\" <br /> <br />Battle ships fascinated him, but he knew nothing about about naval power, so he  <br />let Grand Admiral Raeder care about the navy. Raeder held the highest possible naval  <br />rank and didn't like nazi politics. <br /> <br />That's why he prohibited any kind of political activites by his officers. <br />Anyone, who disobeyed was fired - even Hitler's naval adjutant. <br /> <br />He refused to fire jewish officers like Backenköhler, Grassmann and Rogge <br />and when the \\"Night of Broken Glass\\" came, high ranking officers like  <br />Dönitz and Lütjens and certainly Raeder sharply protested about that. <br /> <br />When Lütjens went to his first and last mission with the Bismark, <br />he carried his navy dagger - decorated with symbols of the Kaiser and  <br />not with swastikas. <br /> <br />The high ranking officers shaped the attitude of the german navy. They <br />hold it pretty much free of politics, made it practically the opposite <br />to the SS, who consisted of \\"political soliders\\". <br /> <br />So talking about \\"historical revisionism\\" in this movie is just wrong.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|Perhaps what I like most, well second most, about this acoustic-Dead version of Wilco is the ease with which the songs roll off - there's nothing to prove, and that aesthetic serves them far better than farting around trying to weld Hendrix to alt-rock. What I happen to like the most about this disc is Nels Cline. I was not overly impressed with either YANKEE or GHOST, but KICKING TELEVISION wasa revelation in just how protean this band can be on a strong night, and they were stunning that evening. <br />Fueling that energy was Nels Cline, who has an unerring sense for what is right for the song, be it in full throttle or in more subdued textures. While not every song on this disc is a keeper, I wouldn't dream of doing without any of the effects he accomplishes in supporting Tweedy's thin writing and thinner voice. Oddly, Tweedy is gifted with making these shortcomings strong points, and thus I'd consider this disc and KTV the best of Wilco since their collaboration with Billy Bragg. <br />The sonics of this disc are very warm - there is an immediate presence to the sound of the music that strips away all the arty pretension of a couple of years' back. I've read comparisons to The Band regarding this record, but that's not accurate on any number of fronts: writing, singing, delivery. I'd say more acoustic Dead - and with Cline delivering impeccably perfect guitar as required, the Garcia analogy is on the nosey. <br />Having criticized Tweedy herein, I have to say that the opening track is one of the best opening tracks I have ever heard on anyone's disc, and the closer \\"We Will Go On\\" is the very best song I believe Tweedy has ever written. An absolutely devastating love song that should last forever. <br />On an album where they so clearly had nothing to prove, they came up aces.

0345308239|5.0|\\"The March of Folly\\" is a book that is sure to get readers thinking about why countries can sometimes do absurd things that wound them badly.  This book focuses on the phenomenon of the (page 4) \\". . .pursuit by governments of policies contrary to their own interest.\\"  She asserts that misgovernment has four facets: (a) tyranny or oppression; (b) excessive ambition; (c) incompetence or decadence; (d) folly or perversity.  This book focuses on the final aspect of misgovernment.<br /><br />To be counted as folly, the policy enacted must meet three standards: (1) it is counter-productive in its own time and not just apparent after-the-fact; (2) practical and feasible alternatives had to be available; (3) the policy in question is not adopted by one person but is part of a group process.  A part of this process is what she colorfully terms \\"wooden-headedness,\\" which (page 7) \\". . .consists in assessing a situation in terms of preconceived fixed notions while ignoring or rejecting any contrary signs.  It is acting according to wish while not allowing oneself to be deflected by the facts.\\"  It reflects what psychologists refer to as \\"confirmation bias,\\" the tendency to accept data consistent with one's views and reject information not compatible with preexisting perspectives.<br /><br />The book considers four illustrations.  The first is the Wooden Horse that the Greek besieging forces introduced into Troy.  This fits Tuchman's definition of folly--it had immediate repercussions harmful to the Trojans' interests; there were simple alternatives available (not bringing the horse inside the city's walls; the decision was the result of group deliberation and discussion.  And the result was disaster for Troy, of course.<br /><br />The second example is the Renaissance Popes making decisions that led to the Protestant movement and the split in Christendom.  The third case study is the British loss of America, as a result of the Revolutionary War.<br /><br />The final instance is America's involvement in Viet Nam.  Was this  folly?  The withdrawal of the United States from Viet Nam had immediate effects, with the fall of the South Vietnamese government and corrosive effects on the United States' national interest; there were other alternatives available than sending in massive numbers of troops and huge amounts of materials; no single person got the United States fully involved in Viet Nam; it was the result of many decisions, spread out over time. Was Viet Nam policy folly?  While some disagree now, many more would contend that this case well illustrates folly.<br /><br />Can one extend the analysis to the American policy toward Iraq?  Is there enough evidence to suggest wooden-headedness (or confirmation bias) by the Administration?  Is the engagement in Iraq counterproductive to America's national interest?  Are there feasible alternatives to the status quo? Was the policy adopted by just one person or was it the result of numerous decision-makers deliberations?  We can certainly answer the last question in the affirmative.  As to the first three questions, each reader would have to make up his or her own mind.  But the book can provoke such reflection, whether considering Iraq or other major policy choices.  This book is well worth looking at.et Nam.  Was this  folly?

B000MV9026|3.0|I bought this for my daughter, and while she enjoyed this movie, I was just disillusioned, totally. The CG work is very good, and the sound mixing was top notch, it isn't enough to save this feature fromt he bottom of the DVD rack where other touted-as-gems-turned-out-to-stink flims reside on my racks as my mother's B-movie sci-fi's and b-movie horror film classics reside. Good for once in a while, but not worth mentioning. It's cute and fluffy and way overdramatic considering the non-existent character development. <br /> <br />Superficially cute, drawn out plot that could have been done in about an hour, and the desire to throttle the penguins because they're too cute and fuzzy. Not even Robin Williams could save it, though I did smile periodically. <br /> <br />The innuendo makes it a no-go for kids who are a little older, and the drama of the heartsong and the rejection make it hard to stomach for people who are NOT addicted to soaps. <br /> <br />All in all, just three stars. Try again, guys....
B000H305U0|4.0|I am the type of person that buys a CD, then only likes one song on the whole thing. This CD though is pretty good- a lot of the songs sound similar, so I like most of the CD because that is the style I liked. Something funky and fun to listen to.
0786838655|5.0|If you have never heard of the Rick Riordan series of books featuring Percy Jackson (which I hadn't), you have a nice surprise in store. This book is so well written, the characters so well developed and the story has so many plot twists, you won't want to stop. My son loves it (he's nine) and I love it just as much (I'm not nine.) My son and I actually discovered and read the second book in the series first (The Sea of Monsters). But, it really doesn't matter if you read them out of sequence. It reminds me of \\"Harry Potter\\" quite a lot. We are both hoping this is turned into a movie. It's that good. Buy it.
B000FL7CAK|1.0|I nearly cried when I bought this season boxset and realised that it doesn't have English subtitles or closed captioning. This is discrimination. Why drop them and yet keep the French and Spanish subtitles? I will be selling this as I can't enjoy it the same as hearing people can do. Warner Brothers and CW will be getting a letter from me. <br /> <br />It's a great show but they're not giving me or other hard of hearing/deaf fans the opportunity to enjoy season 2 as much as others do, so I'll go and spend my money on something I can actually watch and enjoy. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My only complaint is Fox only aired Firefly for one season (14 episodes). It's once in a blue moon that a series grabs me enough that I *have* to watch every episode. The others: Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the Shield. It's rarer still when I can watch a series repeatedly. The other, Buffy, also by Joss Whedon. He's absolutely brilliant with a lot to say.  <br /> <br />I didn't come across this masterpiece until a couple years ago when friends thought I would like it. I love it! After I watched the series, they had me watch Serenity, which ties up loose ends to the too soon cut series. Talk about going out with a bang. I now own both. Only after these and falling in love with Whedon's cinematography and writing did I start enjoying Buffy (thanks to my same friends).  <br /> <br />Even if you aren't a huge fan of sci-fi or westerns, the plots and character depth is enough to catch one in their snares. It's witty, funny, cliff hanging, and cutting edge for a series. The cast is superb and I now perk up when anything has Nathan Fillion, who got the part of Malcom Reynolds after a short appearance as an evil priest in Buffy. Firefly/Serenity have an increasingly large mass of fans and followers. It becomes a contagious addiction. I now have two friends hooked, lined, and sunk.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|I saw this at the theatre and knew I'd buy it when it came out on DVD. It's just a really nice movie to watch if you want a pick-me-up. The acting is a bit cheesy, especially on Cam's part in some places, but it still works. A feel good movie that lets you escape yourself to both sunny California and quaint a little snowey English cottage all at the same time. Even my husband liked the movie, and that is unbelievable.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried about this ablum. All I heard about it was it was something different. But when I finally did get it, it was great. Definitely a change from what else is out there now and people just have to like that.  Not to mention the extra bonus features on the deluxe edition. You get to see the process of making the cd. Most artists say that it was great to make the album, but have never really shown the it being done. Luckily this was a fun album so you got to see a fun Avril too. Each song represents the fun and happy side of Avril and am glad to see it and that she continues to change things up. I do however only have one thing wrong with the album and that is the last song on it. That song is \\"Keep Holding On,\\" from the \\"Eragon\\" movie. That song has been out for way longer than the album and a lot of people already had the song downloaded. So I would have liked to have something else there in its place. Otherwise great album and can't wait for more.
B00082IJ08|5.0|I'm a Hiphop head and the peeps behind this project came up with some different yet cool music. I like their music and will be getting their next album(have the others). Is it Rock or is it Hip Hop? Neither it just good music and big 5 stars just for originality and good music. Wish more projects would come about and make some cool music with some base, horns and original stuff. Good Album, Liked hearing Del La Soul back too.
0374105235|4.0|Fantastic book. The author provides a (mostly) forthright account of his experiences as a war refuge and soldier in a simple prose that eloquently and effectively communicates his story. The people who where instrumental in shaping his life (the soldiers that conscripted him into their army and those who rehabilitated him) effectively demonstrate the duality of man. Fascinating look into human nature and the destructive forces that continue to tear apart the African continent.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Several years ago when Linkin Park released Hybrid Theory and Meteora, I was the biggest nu-metal fan, but I've changed since then and I'm not too fond of their first two albums anymore.  I was pretty skeptical about their new album, but I was shocked to hear what a difference there was in musical style.  Linkin Park sticks to its rock and screaming style in tracks \\"Given Up\\" (which has an 18 second long scream), and \\"No More Sorrow,\\" both of which you'll want to hear over and over again, BUT it is a different kind of rock, it doesn't sound bland like their old stuff.  The band mostly ventures into more smooth, and at sometimes indie sounding songs with this album especially the last track \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\" which actually sounds Snow Patrol-ish.  The rap-rock style that made them famous is seldomly heard on this album in fact only two tracks of flowing are featured.  One of the two tracks are \\"Bleed it Out\\" which is a fun up-tempo, rhythmatic track which has its hooks, featuring clapping and a screamed course by Chester, you won't be disappointed with this song if you're a fan of Shinoda.  \\"Hands Held High\\" is the second song featuring Shinoda's rhymes, which consists of politically driven lyrics over a pipe organ and marching snare drums; an odd combo but they make it work.  The track \\"In Between\\" caught me off guard because it doesn't sound anything like Linkin Park.  The track has a rough cut of Mike singing over the smooth ambient sound of a chelo, synth and bass; it's a very simple song that abandons Linkin Park's traditional \\"corporate rock\\" sound.  Another unusual track is \\"In Pieces\\" because it sounds more indie than anything because it has a mostly synthetical sound to it accompanied with a repeating strum of the guitar that sounds similar to something that The Postal Service would make, but Chester's vocal performance on it pulls it off and Linkin Park makes it thier own; plus it features one of the best guitar solos on the album.  Overall,I noticed that the band got better at their guitar rifts.  The previous albums followed the same rifts in a song (they play the same rythm throughout the whole song, \\"Don't Stay\\" from Meteora is a good example of that) and I noticed that their guitar structure had gotton more complicated then their standard stuff used to be.  Lyrically, this is their best album.  The lyrics are about so much more then their previous albums that were centralized around teen-angst, and I'm glad that they broke the habit (get it...breaking the habit?!?!?).    If you're like me and have grown up since Meteora, you won't be disappointed with Minutes to Midnight.  This isn't an album for prepubesent losers wanting a Meteora part two, it's an album featuring a more mature sound and artistic direction.  In other words, if you were 8 when LP's last album came out you'll hate this one.  I'm really impressed that Linkin Park was able to do such a 180 and I can honestly say that it's the best album they have released so far.  I just hope that I don't see a remixed version of this album in about a year.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|album of the summer, just like yhft was, what, 5 summers ago?  <br /> <br />this is an understated, brilliant set of songs beautifully played and recorded. if there was ever any question of the stature and longevity of jeff tweedy's career, there is a question no longer. proves that even almost stripped of instrumental experimentation this guy's songs (and the presentation thereof) remain facinating/absorbing and somehow uplifting. i agree with the Lennon reference made by others and also feel strongly that Tweedy's work is on that high a level.  <br /> <br />and oh what a band!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|A terrific show with great music. Color and sound are excellent.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul, released in late 1965 showed that The Beatles have stepped their pop sound up a notch, showing maturity and a more sophisticated sound compared to their earlier work.<br />Definitely one of the Greatest Albums in Pop/Rock Music history. As it is a High chart topper among many magazines including TIME and it was in the TOP 5 of 500 by Rolling Stone magazine a few years ago. This influential Masterpiece was, and still is enjoyed by millions all over the world from the most Be-loved Band on the Planet!<br />Sure, I wasn't around in the '60s, but I do fondly remember back in the '80s when I was a child just learning to tie my shoes and my parents would blast \\"Rubber Soul\\" all the time from the record player downstairs. A lovely Musical experience I must say! And it is now one of my earliest memories. My Dad turned me on to Led Zeppelin a few years later. What an Up-bringing!<br /> We bought \\"Rubber Soul\\" -when it was first released on Cd in 1987 or '88.<br />I have so many Favorites on \\"Rubber Soul\\" - I wouldn't want to bore anyone by re-listing every single track.<br />I will however list my TOP Faves: \\"Drive My Car\\" - \\"You Won't See Me\\" - \\"The Word\\" - \\"Michelle\\" & \\"Girl\\"<br />To me, \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" are The Fab Fours TWO Best!
B0002EXH54|4.0|because let's be honest, Mustaine's vocals on here are not perfect. Yes, I know back then, the technology they were using wasn't the best but I cannot fully give an album 5 stars if the vocals aren't good. Besides that though, the musicianship and the songwriting is good. I guess my only complaint which doesn't add to whether I like it or not are the bonus tracks. What's the friggin' point? They are essentially the same track except are worse? I would rather just have the original songs or if you're going to put bonus songs on the CD, put b-sides or live versions, not worthless remixes.
1401207529|4.0|I am a fan of Frank Miller's other works like Sin City, 300, and Dark Knight Returns. He brings his trademark \\"gritty\\" style to this tale. This is an origin story, but more so, it is a character examination of the duality of of the Bruce Wayne/Batman character. Mazzucchelli's art is effective as always, if a little \\"dated\\" by today's standards. <br /> <br />I was surprised to see the majority of the story devoted to Lt. Gordon and not Batman. However, this is not necessarily a weekness in the story, it is just something interested buyers should be aware of. I enjoyed Miller's successfull attempt at fleshing out Gordon's character beyond the standard \\"Batman's ally.\\" <br /> <br />Upon finishing the book, I couldn't help thinking about how Christopher Nolan and the rest of the crew who worked on Batman Begins did a great job of mining this book--and dare I say--improving on the origin story of Bruce Wayne/Batman. Although I enjoyed Batman: Year One, Batman Begins continues to be the definitive origin story of Batman in my opinion. With that said, the story is great and would be worthy of five stars if it wasn't for the compressed nature of the narrative. The new trade paperback from DC is high quality and looks good on the book shelf. I would recommend any interested Batman fan pick this up as long as they are aware of what to expect from the story.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I guess I was expecting this album to have the same level of energy as the previous two CDs. This one just does not do it for me.  Mike does not rap as much he did before.  Chester did not have his usual lyrics where he is screaming at the top of his lungs and gets your heart thumping.  This is a BIG disappointment. Two out three ain't bad.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|What in the world were they thinking of?  Being different or maturing does not mean mindlessly throwing everything out the window.  There is not one song on this album that resembles the LP style.  No rock-rap mix, no Mr Hahn and no vigor. <br /> <br />To have listeners wait years for this album and then to come out with this is just inexcusable.  Does LP even care about its fans?  Or do they care about enjoying themselves more by playing around and being 'different' to entertain themselves? <br /> <br />Or is it that band just got complacent?  Too much touring, too many side projects like Mike Shinoda's Fort Minor, and not enough put into this album.  They say that they wrote over a hundred songs - is that an attempt out of guilt to cover up the lack of time spent on this album?  It is as if Mike Shinoda had entered the studio in the last minute from his side projects and that Joe Hahn had nothing to do with this album. <br /> <br />Well done LP, you have just lost most of your fans.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|softer then previous outings, not bad though.  like other LP, still good summer time listening. <br /> <br />one thing i do have to say, Track #4, definitely, definitely, definitely needs MORE COWBELL!!!!
B0006GVJEE|5.0|If you like the movie, the Director's Cut is a must.  24-34 minutes added was worth it.  Having the cast again and hearing the backstories was worth the addition.  I just wish Gary Oldman was there too, but sadly missed
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I have been a big fan of Linkin Park and absolutely loved their first two albums.  Minutes to Midnight has a completely new style to it that does not sound like band.  Overall it is much more mellow than the rest of their material and I only really enjoyed 3 of the 12 songs. Even then, nothing really blew me away with this album unlike with Hybrid Theory and Meteora.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Megadeth is in full swing again. With the crispness of Rust in Piece, the Grittyness of Peace Sells, United Abominations rips through it's twelve tracks with no appologies.  The Drover brothers and Lomenzo play together like they have been in this band like the past 20 years.   This is a great introduction for new Megadeth fans to jump aboard, and a must have at all cost for all megadeth fans.  Blistering tracks like Washington is Next and Play For Blood are classic thrash, Gears of War a great single, and the Title Track is full blown Peace sells, let the politicians know what dave thinks.  A tout le monde is a nice re-do of an old classic, but a song like \\"Black Rain\\" could have been placed here, and this a bonus track.  That is my only small quirp.  Other tracks like Amerikhatan, very funny and dripping with sarcasm and scinicism, and Burn Ice another great song about the hazards of drugs.  Sleepwalker was a great track to open with, nice guitar work.  This album should easily be everyone's top metal pick of the year, baring a reunion of pantera with all of it's original members...(that's how good this is). Get This Album!!!
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Growing up as an 80's thrash kid, I've always found myself waiting for the followup to Master of Puppets, Reign In Blood, Peace Sells, etc. Convinced years ago that this would never happen, I moved on. I'm here to say United Abominations is the follow up that I've always hoped for in the classic thrash realm. This album from start to finish is a masterpiece. Mustaine has the growl back and the guitar work is inspired and classic! I have not put this album down since it's purchase and it gets better with every listen. Buy it!
B00005JPFH|4.0|If you are a fan of the other two movies, then this will be a bit of a slower movie, and a slight let down, but still well worthy of four stars.  There are some really corny parts that are hard to take, but otherwise, this has the action, the back story, and decent characters to boot.  There are a few to many villians at one point, and it feels like the movie rushes all at once to try and give everyone their place, but still runs together well overall.  Check this film out in the theaters, worth buying on DVD.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|That sums it up in a nutshell...this record sounds like it could have been the logical next release after Rust in Peace. Not quite as good as that classic masterpiece, but close enough. Just listen to \\"Washington is Next\\"! <br /> <br />Trust me, this is the Megadeth record we've been waiting over 15 years for!! <br />Phenomenal!
B000MXPE7O|4.0|The I feel that the movie is more artistic than entertaining. There is no sizzle, but a good story, a real good story. The characters are just right. Worth a watch, or 2.
B0002NRQTI|4.0|While I think this is a great record I would't say it was \\"best since Power Windows\\" or \\"best ever.\\"  I agree, that this is a very good, sound piece by Rush.  I just reviewed Roll the Bones, which I feel is a better work, and is actually their best effort since Moving Pictures.  Counterparts is different that Roll the Bones in that it is a little more \\"driving\\" and sounds slighty more mechanical.  It's a little more straightforward than RTB and rocks a little harder.  The more I've listened to it over the years the better I've liked it.  However, as an overall work it doesn't have as many memorable or distinct songs as Roll the Bones.  I definitely think it is better than Power Windows, probably better than Presto, better than Test for Echo, and up there with Grace Under Pressure and Hold Your Fire (as far as their later works).  It is probably their second best work since the 80's. I would definitely reccomend it.  BTW, Cold Fire is the best song on here, and Stick It Out and Animate are fantastic.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|The movie itself hasn't lost anything with age--still funny and sad and amazingly beautiful.  The special features are outstanding; it's hard to imagine what the movie would have been with Steve McQueen as Butch and Paul Newman as Sundance, but that was the original casting.  How it fizzled and why the studio fought so hard to find someone--anyone--in place of an unsuitable fill-in named Robert Redford are only a few of the inside stories packed on the features disc.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|This is one of those mysteries in the history of filmaking... However talented John Frankenheimer and the actors involved were / are, how could someone have imagined that a racing car movie made in 1966, I REPEAT, 1966, would still be, in 2007, head and shoulders bette than all the race movies ever made, before or after!!<br /><br />Because \\"Grand Prix\\" is a master-piece. I will not talk about the amzaing camera angles, the perfect edition, the fact that the actor themselves drive the cars (F3 cars, it's true...), makin a montage with the actual race, the fact that the plot, altough simple, is engaging and makes you cheer for each one of the drivers.<br /><br />No. I'll talk about the \\"feel\\" of the movie. It flows effortlessly, with class, energy, everything.
B000002KET|4.0|One of my favs from the Ozzy era, \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" brings in a fresh new sound (for the time), and concentrates less on the heaviness that prevails on earlier Sabbath. Songs such as \\"Killing Yourself to Live\\" break new ground for Sabbath, and represent a slighly different  approach. That's not to say that there are not moments of sheer bludgeoning delight; for example, the title track's ending guitar/ bass line is the heaviest ever created by mortal man....this must be played extremely loud for all to give praise.  But whatever the goal was, it worked for me. This is one fine set of tunes.

B000002KKS|4.0|I usually don't bother with post-Ozzy Sabbath, but when the fans stopped giving Dio the finger long enough to listen to this in 1980, they realized they had a masterpeice on their hands. Unlike it's successor, the overblown \\"Mob Rules\\", Heaven and Hell still had a good amount of '70's hard rock style to keep it out of the '80's excess department. That's not to say the songs are just average. Indeed, these are classics in their own right and go down with the best Ozzy and company had to offer in the '70's. Dio is in top form, and provided a fresh new sound for the rest of the band to use as a springboard to launch these new songs. Later releases would build on and recycle \\"Heaven and Hell\\", but  ultimately Sabbath would never be this good again.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|While this album is very different from the first two, I think the different style if a nice change of pace for the band.  If they had released another album of the same stuff over and over again, then it just gets boring.  This shows that LP has a great range, and I think the lyrics and vocals on this album are great.   <br /> <br />Every group changes their style and sound over the years, so true fans should stop ripping on them for this album.  Would you want to go up and perform the same 6 songs over and over again?  The group needs to feel good about what they are performing, and they obviously felt good about this album...as do I!!

B000O1799U|1.0|If anything proves the old adage \\"They don't make `em like they used to\\" it's the recent (and I can't write this word without an industrial-scale vat of sarcasm) `musical' called `Dreamgirls'.<br /><br />Starring Jamie Foxx, Beyonc&eacute; Knowles and Eddie Murphy, Dreamgirls is adapted from the highly successful stage musical which is loosely based on the story of Diana Ross and the Supremes and the rise and fall of the Motown record label. The mettle of any musical is tested by the quality of its soundtrack so on that basis Dreamgirls is probably the worst musical I've seen since Moulin Rouge. It's only about half way though the film when, on the way to a fight in an alleyway that one of the characters suddenly burst into song and we realise that we're watching a musical at all. Up until then it's merely a bad film about the music industry with badder songs (badder in the `not good sense' as opposed to the James Brown sense) The `I'm Telling You I'm Not Going' sequence is more than aptly named - I thought I was going to die of old age before it ended. In fact it's probably still going on somewhere. Newcomer Jennifer Hudson, who apparently won herself in an American television contest, steals a show which really isn't worth having. Beyonc&eacute; does little more than give `gorgeous lessons' to all and sundry while Eddie Murphy's much lauded performance is merely adequate. The only oasis in this cinematic desert is the Op-art sets and Beyonc&eacute;'s 60's/70's Ross-esque costumes.<br /><br />Dreamgirls is further evidence that the idiom of the musical appears to be a creature of the past. Unlike the last great film musical Grease (1978), Dreamgirls' editing suggests that none of the dancers are capable of a complete uninterrupted routine and if the songs here were truly of the standard that Motown were putting out they would never have been heard beyond the confines of Berry Gordy's bedroom. Surely Motown, arguably the most important record label in the history of recorded sound, deserves a better tribute that this. No siree-bop, they don't make `em like they used to. Next time you're in the mood for a truly great musical, with great songs and brilliantly choreographed dance spectacle and you're all Gene Kelly'd out - see James Cagney's little known 1933 classic Footlight Parade' you'll be singing `Shanghai Lil' for days.r tribute that this.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|I totally understand why many LP fans are disappointed with this album because it IS drastically different than the others...but I actually really like this album.  I do miss the old LP sound, but the meaning in the lyrics is what I love about this album.  I've always loved LP's lyrics & this is one of their best as far as lyrics go.  I also like the change of pace, it's definitely slower with more melody... just a change that's all.

B000EULJLU|4.0|It's been a few years since I fist discovered Tool.  A gem in the rough that I never thought I'd come across in my wildest dreams.  The first album I heard by the band was Aenima, which, is a masterpiece in and of itself. I then picked up Lateralus and was stunned by the musicianship put forth, in fact, Lateralus is probably one of the top 10 must have rock albums of all time.  Undertow was Tool in their infancy and another top notch album that I picked up after Lateralus.  After constant rotation in my cd changer for a year or so, Tool became my favorite band.  When I finally had the spare change to pick up a used copy of 10,000 days at FYE, I jumped immediately at the opportunity.  The cd doesn't disappoint on a musical scale, especially when compared to the garbage rock/metal music that has been released in the past 16 months or so.  However, when compared to Lateralus, Aenima and Undertow, 10,000 days seems more like a disappointment than a success.  The cd opens with Vicarious, which is one hell of a song, and probably one of the better Tool songs ever made.  Jambi was equally as impressive and by the end of the song I was anticipating this album to be the Tool album that would define their career.  However, the cd quickly takes a wrong turn with Wings for Marie, which, even after several listens, has not grown on me and I don't expect it to ever do so.  10,000 days (pt.2) was a step up from the track prior to it, but still was not on the same level of Vicarious and Jambi.  The Pot is one of Tool's best known songs and at first I didn't like it, however, it's now a regular on my mixed cds and favorite track lists. Then the cd goes into 2 interludes.  I really wish Tool would drop these meaningless segments that are seemingly there to just fill up track space.  Rosetta Stoned is Tool at their finest, making it virtually impossible to tag or label the song under any specific genre. Intention and Right in Two make you feel like this album had so much potential andmade you feel famished after the feast by the time you get to Viginti Tres, which is such a horrible song that I don't even bother to acknowledge its existance. <br /> <br />Bottom Line: <br />Vicarious- 10/10 <br />Jambi- 9/10 <br />Wings for Marie- 4/10 <br />10,000 Days- 6/10 <br />The Pot- 9.5/10 <br />Rosetta Stoned- 10/10 <br />Intention- 8/10 <br />Right in Two- 10/10 <br />Viginti Tres- 3/10 <br /> <br />Overall- 4/5 stars.  Tool is VERY capable of better than this, but this album is still going to stay in my cd changer for a LONG time.  I love the progressive nature of Tool, and hopefully they continue to shock and awe their fans for years to come.

B000NA1OXY|1.0|I have worn out Avril's first two CDs as well as her live performance DVD.  I even ripped the audio from the DVD to a CD so that I could listen to it in the car.  This CD is beyond disappointing.  It is SO bee-bop and sugar-pop that it really is sickening.  She will likely win a few Britany Spears fans but it's such a shame that she's gone and flushed herself down the pop toilet.  She had a unique sound with a depth and maturity that surpassed her age - I was really looking forward to more of her talent.  It's like she heard \\"Oh Mickey You're So Fine\\" from the 80's and decided to write an entire album based on that one song. ([[ASIN:B000002Z8S The Best of Toni Basil: Mickey & Other Love Songs]]) <br /> <br />If you liked her before, you won't like this.  If you like Britney Spears and Backstreet Boys, you will love it.

B000002LIX|5.0|What an album! This is REAL alternative-rock, back when it really WAS an alternative to something. It's got bits of funk, prog, folk, psychedelia, whatever, in addition to hard rock. It all comes together on the the three long guitar workouts: Three Days (JA's best ever IMHO), Then She Did and Of Course. Dave Narravo was (and still is) a talented creative guitarists. And where to hear that better than these pieces. And the lyrics on those first two... amazing. So the three funk/prog/folk/psychedelic/hard-rock songs rule supremely, but you knew that already. The record's first half is just as good though, with some equally memorable, more conventional rockers: the funky hit Been Caught Stealin' is probably the catchiest song about crime I've ever heard. A great song to blast. The rockers Stop and No One's Leaving are also quite cool, even if they're a lot more normal than the best songs, they still pack a punch. And these guys can do riffs!<br /><br />This is to me JA's best album, a classic for the ages. The early '90s was a very creative period for rocck music (almost as much so as my beloved '65-'75!), and this is probably the best album to come from the era.

B000NVIXFK|3.0|I love Rush (since 1979), but I have real difficulty getting into any of their more recent music. Its like trying to eat something that is said to be the height of the culinary experience, but you can't convince yourself to swallow it.  <br /> <br />There is an omnipresent somber feel and drone to Rush's more recent efforts. Why can't they produce something with optimistism and vibrancy?  Why not retain some of the musical marques that have identified them in the 70's and 80's?  No more whining philosophical statements either! <br /> <br />Here are a list of contributing factor towards Rush's decline: <br /> <br />1) Their financial and commercial successes. They aren't hungry for musical/lyrical victories anymore...The passion and zeal to succeed in this fashion is missing. Rush is more interested in enjoying themselves as capitalists and living the good life(Which they deserve). Money is their \\"Prime mover\\" as evidenced by the unending release of live videos and CD compilations. They have realized their shelf-life expiration and are doing everything before the fan base involutes.  <br /> <br />2) Their age. Face it, they are not in the mood (no pun) to produce what they used to. I'm confident they consider themselves in constant evolution, but in reality they have stopped evolving and only move in an aimless direction.   <br /> <br />3) The times are a changin'... Rush, like their peers, are going the way of the dinosaur since the musical climate is so vastly different than earlier times.   <br /> <br />4) They're artistically spent(and have every right to be). They are great in concert with their older material, but the chemistry and passion to produce anymore is long gone.  Its like marriage...You don't get up like you used to after 30 years of it. <br /> <br />I cringe when I say these things about Rush since I love them and the music they made from the 70's to late 80's.  They played a big part of my latter teens and all through college.  I'm not living in thepast, but this new stuff they're is feeding us will only satiate the blind Rush fan.   <br />I one day hope they decide to surprise everyone with a masterpiece recording before they decide to call it quits.
B000O178BY|5.0|On Trent Reznor's fifth Nine Inch Nails album, he'd like you to believe that the world is coming to an end. Taking a page or two from George Orwell's \\"1984,\\" \\"Year Zero\\" is about a world, not too far into the future, where the government has taken complete control and society lives in a police state, on the verge of implosion. Thinking about the way the world is these days, it's hard to see this, not so much as a work of fiction, but as a glamourized glimpse into the inevitable future. But whether Trent is right or not, whether \\"Year Zero\\" is just a liberal nightmare, is irrelevant. For starters, it makes for an intriguing album concept, one which was shrouded in mystery up to it's release with bizarre marketing campaigns, making even the die-hard NIN fan wonder if this was for real. Also, it's Trent at his strongest, coming hot off the heels of the successful \\"With Teeth\\" and delivering his best material since the 1990's.<br /><br />Upon your first few listens, you might not 'get' \\"Year Zero.\\" You may not understand why it has had so much hype and is being heralded as Trent's best in a long while. But like I myself learned, this is an album that needs to be absorbed as much as possible. Each song contains a message and a meaning that helps push the concept along. On \\"The Good Soldier,\\" Trent sounds like a hopeful, but lost individual, stating \\"This is not where I should be, I am trying to believe,\\" but turns bitter towards the end with songs like \\"The Great Destroyer\\" and \\"Another Version Of The Truth\\" turning him stronger, but more and more paranoid and defiant. Despite Trent's insistence that this is a 'noisy' album, it doesn't live up to the thrashier moments of \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" instead, Trent seems bound and determined to turn any noise into music. Somehow, Trent makes every single ugly noise work together in beauty, making this his finest production effort ever. It truly is a marvel at how he put this all together in such a short time, a true testament to his genius.<br /><br />For those who like their 'Nails without all the bells and whistles, Trent delivers some strong radio fare here, with the first single, \\"Survivalism\\" as well as \\"My Violent Heart,\\" \\"Capitol G\\" and the album's best track, \\"The Warning.\\" But to understand what makes this album so great, you must devote time to taking in all sixteen of it's tracks. You don't need to get wrapped up in the marketing campaigns -- which includes a toll-free hotline on the back of the album for turning yourself in and a CD that changes colors -- to appreciate and understand<br />\\"Year Zero.\\" Because underneath all the hype and all the drama, this album is a stark peek into a future that sadly might not be so far off.nius.

6305922756|5.0|My husband is inordinately amused by this movie, but on second, third, and yes, even fourth viewing -- I've decided he's right: it's one of the silliest, funniest movies ever made.  The trouble is, it is so well done, if you didn't know it was satire, you might think it was real!
B00005Q4CS|3.0|This movie kind of creeped me out. Director's cut or not is was still explicit. I finished the DVD with a sick feeling in my stomach. There is definitely more to this movie than meets the eye.<br /><br />Read Ellen Burstyn's [[ASIN:1594489297 Lessons in Becoming Myself]]. That is a more accurate picture of this amazing woman.
B000O178BY|5.0|Trent has done it again with a beautiful album that can definitely stand up to the name of NIN. <br /> <br />For a while, I was set on the idea that The Fragile was the peak of Trent's career.  The Fragile to me displayed the deepest feeling Trent ever had in his music.  With Teeth always struck me as a watered down album compared to The Fragile.  But finally, Year Zero has begun to challenge, what is in my opinion, the best of NIN. <br /> <br />One of the first impressions about the album I had was its similarity to Pretty Hate Machine.  Probably that sense came from how the album appears to have returned strongly to the core of industrial music.  As I had described it to friends, Year Zero was like a mixture of every NIN album into one but with an emphasis on Pretty Hate Machine. <br /> <br />I always felt that With Teeth didn't have the touch needed to really feel like a full blown NIN album.  It might have been due to the straight approach to music With Teeth had when it came to producing the music rather than using sampling on top of sampling to create a different sound.  This is where Year Zero comes in. <br /> <br />Year Zero brought NIN back to the sound that displayed the originality of the band.  The album found the perfect balance between style change and transitional quality. <br /> <br />The final thing I need to mention is the intensity of the music.  It has reached the point that The Fragile obtained. <br /> <br />More artists need to strive for the depth Trent puts into his music today.  His music is as dynamic as the publicity put together for this album and deserves attention.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Casino Royale takes James Bond and turns him inside out...in a good way.  This is the movie Pierce Brosnan wanted to do as James Bond.  He begged and pleaded with the producers to make a movie that showed a Bond stripped down and dirty.  It's a shame too, because it's a great flick. <br /> <br />This is by far one of the best Bond flicks ever.  Let me put this in perspective for you; I think Sean Connery is great, but I never knew him as 007.  I grew up on Roger Moore as James Bond.  For Your Eyes Only, The Spy Who Loved me...those were great.  Then came Timothy Dalton.  Dalton tried hard and I respect his effort, but the only two movies he did fell flat on their face.  Then came Brosnan, who I thought was superior to Dalton and Moore in all ways.  The first three movies he did as Bond were excellent.  Without a doubt they re-energized the franchise in the best ways.   <br /> <br />Then they made Die Another Day, and I felt really sorry for Brosnan.  In an effort to go back to campy stunts and overblown F/X in an attempt to celebrate the anniversary of Bond, they made it too over the top.  Now it seems someone with a brain has come in and made everyone take a few steps back and decided to show everyone why James Bond is who he is.   <br /> <br />Casino Royale starts with 007's second assignment.  It involves a kill, and as his victim finds out, it's much easier the second time.  Yes, considerably.  The chase sequence at the beginning through a construction zone in Madagascar will leave your jaw dropped.  Then as the movie moves on to the exotic locales like the Bahamas and Montengro (always stunning locations in Bond movies) we notice almost right away this is a different Bond.  Full of ego and confidence he's vicious and much more violent then what we're used to.  Tending to solve his problems with fists and bullets rather than brains and cunning.  M (brilliantly played again by Judi Dench) refers to him as a `Blunt Instrument' and his failure to see the `Big picture' causes issues with his own foreseen outcome in some situations.   <br /> <br />Now to the good part; Daniel Craig as James Bond, 007.  What were they thinking?  Putting a critically acclaimed actor in the role of one of the world's most beloved Spy characters?  Well someone what thinking clearly!  Craig is by far the most accomplished actor to take on the role  even though he doesn't quite fit the part with his blonde hair and...good GOD those EARS!  Nevertheless, he loses himself in the role so deeply that you finally feel like this is a real person, a real character.  Not a characture.  When ordering a Vodka Martini and asked, `Shaken or Stirred', we get a firm `Do I look like I give a damn' in accordance with the characters mood at the moment.  We are treated to a Bond who feels, gets angry, gets reckless and most of all, falls in love.  As his relationship with Vesper Lynn (Eva Green) builds, our affection for her does as well.  We find ourselves liking this woman as much as he does.  Again, this movie takes a step back and shows us why Bond is the way he is, and it's a near perfect execution.  It's just...those damn ears!   <br /> <br />As with any Bond movie there are women and tuxedos, cards and martinis and a villain with an unusual character trait.  But strangely, no Moneypenny.  No Q, no gadgets!  I was somewhat disappointed in this but didn't really miss it.  The character study shows us something we have finally never seen in James Bond, something Brosnan tried to get the producers to do a long time ago but for some reason, they wouldn't.  I think Pierce would have been great in this movie, he was my favorite Bond but I do think Craig could surpass him depending on the next installment.  But most importantly, Casino Royale jump starts the franchise once more, and gives them a place to start from all over again.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|To direct this movie, Will Smith hand-picked Italian director Gabriele Muccino, whose previous two films Will had seen and was greatly impressed with. This was to be Muccino's first English-speaking movie, and his first time directing non-Italian speaking people.<br /><br />The result is Will's best performance in any film yet. Will himself (in the \\"Making Persuit\\" fetaurette on this DVD) proclaims this film as his greatest achievement to date.<br /><br />I have to agree that choosing a European director was a very wise choice. It gives the film a realism and a point of view that would have been hard to find in a Hollywood director. Muccino's saw this as an \\"American dream\\" come true story, and how a father-son relationship should be.<br /><br />The final scene, showing Gardner's final interview with the Big Bosses including his reaction once he gets outside the building, was possibly the most touching moment I have ever seen in a movie. His expression and reaction was so real, so emotional I couldn't help but cry with him for joy and for his pain through the journey. The perfect choice to end the film.<br /><br />Extras:<br /><br /># Father and Son: Onscreen and Off<br /><br />This is a great introduction to Will's son, Jaden. It shows that the filmmakers were reluctant to consider him at first. It was only after testing thousand of boys in three weeks (and not being happy with any of them) that director Gabriele Muccino asked the other producers if they thought it would be ok to audition Will's son. Jaden blew the other kids out of the water in the tests and the chemistry between him and Will made their relationship on film all the more real.<br /><br /># The Man Behind the Movie: A Conversation with Chris Gardner<br /><br />This is a short featurette (8-9 minutes) with clips from an interview with the real Chris Gardner. It was interesting to learn that the real Reverend who ran the outreach center where Chris and his son stayed a few nights, Rev. Cecil Williams, played himself in the film. Chris Gardner insisted on it! The location was also the real place. Chris said that without Cecil Williams, thousands of San Fransisco's homeless (including Gardner) would be in desperate trouble or even dead. We also learn that the subway-bathroom where Chris and son spend a night was an exact replica of the real one. We learn that the director insisted they use real homeless people as extras to play many of the homeless! And many other interesting facts.<br /><br /># Making Pursuit: An Italian Take on the American Dream<br /><br />This is where we learn the most about the choice of Gabriele Muccino as director. A fantastic featurette documenting the making of the film, specifically experienced from a first-time English-speaking-movie director. Imagine directing actors and a crew in your second or third language and not being able to express your thoughts or ideas very well because you don't know the words! Fascinating how he pulled it off!<br /><br /># Inside the Rubik's Cube<br /><br />A short featurette (under 6-7 mins) about the rubics cube. It was invented by a Hungarian. In the 80's 1 out of 4 households had one. The HUGE success helped bring Hungary out of communism. And more history. Also a bit about \\"cubing\\" today.<br /><br /># \\"I Can\\" Song (audio only)<br /><br />A song written for the film, but not used in the theatrical release. Nice, but hard to *only* listen to a song (without seeing video attached) since this is a dvd.<br /><br /># Audio commentary with director Gabriele Muccino<br /><br />Commentaries are some of my favorite features on DVD's. But they are either hit or miss. This one was very good! Muccino starts off explaining how he got involved with the film (hand-picked by Will Smith) and his initial meetings with Will where they discussed their visions for the story. He described some of the challenges directing such a HUGE production, including the insane amount of extras in some scenes (he says American extras are the most professional he has ever encountered), to the period cars (some scenes had well over 100 cars from the period (early '80s), to how he selected and then directed some of the actors. He expresses his deep admiration and respect for Will Smith as an actor and how well Smith took critique and direction.<br /><br />An EXCELLENT film with some great extras. I highly recommend this to anybody who loves their family and wants to pursue a dream! :)professional he has ever encountered), to the period cars (some scenes had well over 100 cars from the period (early '80s), to how he selected and then directed some of the actors.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|Linkin Park is an amazing band. I am not a big metal fan. I can't stand rap. But for some reason Linkin Park really gets my toes tapping and even my head banging! <br /> <br />They warned their fan base that this would be a different album this time around and they were absolutely correct. Linkin Park has been up until this point a rap-metal-electronica hybrid. This album is more of a metal-arena rock hybrid and I have to say its not bad! <br /> <br />I am not the type of Linkin Park fan that knows each band member's name nor do I get onto the \\"LP is selling out man!\\" trip. All I know is there is some good music on here.  <br /> <br />Reading the reviews I can't help but remember the hub bub that surrounded Metallica's Black album. Although, Minutes to Midnight does not compare to the brilliance of the Black Album, it looks like Linkin Park is having to grow up a little and I think they will be better off for it.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|I watched this movie at the movie theater and bought it when came on video. It's just a great adventure movie with action all the time. Those two guys played perfect together. The story is funny and serious at the same time. They are just not afraid of the danger. You laughed at their attitude toward the danger, but it's beautiful, even in places not all that to look. Very good. No sex scene, no bad language. It seems like watching Indiana Jones in a different situation. I recommend it.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|Well, I (for one) am totally satisfied with this new record. Vocally, It's Tweedy's finest moment to date, hands down. The lyrics are (as always) just plain good, varying in cryptic complexity from none whatsoever..to a healthy, minor dose. Musically, it's not a giant departure from their last effort, but I certainly wouldn't call it 'more of the same'. Musically, I'm blown away; shame on anyone who mistakes the lack of sonic experimentation for a lack of adventurousness.  <br /> <br />The biggest complaint I've heard from fellow fans who aren't digging this album is that the guitar solos are show-offy. While there is a pretty mean flurry at the climax of 'Side With the Seeds', I don't find it bothersome. In fact, I've grown to appreciate the chaotic nature of the solo (which comes during a rather intense musical moment all around). What seems to be alienating some 'Foxtrot' fans (again) is the lack of sonic experimentation. But do you guys really want this great band to repeat its self? I don't. They did the 'Foxtrot' thing already, and, while I love that record to death.....I don't need a sequal (and I'm sure they wouldn't be interested in making one).  <br /> <br />What you get on 'Sky Blue Sky' is a band of musicians (and...damn good ones, to be sure) playing really well-written, compelling songs. What the hell do you want?
B000BKVQTS|5.0|I had a great time watching this movie and see the characters I have read in books come to life. They are funny and it's like they jump inside their own fantasy world. If you know the Brothers Grimm stories, you will see what I am talking about. Everything was very well done and looks so real. And they have a strange sense of humor. Those brothers see themselves involved in the world they wrote about it and suddenly it's too dangerous even for them. But it's funny too. It's a family movie for the weekend...
B000Q99EAC|4.0|The first Rocky movies were good but then the sequels got more and more absurd. I rented this one out of boredom...best renting decision I've made in a while. This is a really good movie. Stallone is likable and believable as the aged Rocky and the story itself is well done. Definitely worth watching.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The story is excellent and I enjoyed, but it's not suit for kids. It has lots of violence, blood and fights. It's a sci-fi a little too much for sensitive eyes. But I really enjoyed that girl with all those powers. And the places she has to go to find the answer. If you can get over the fights and blood, watch it. It's interesting.
6304698623|5.0|We saw this movie on HBO and purchased it because it is so beautiful.  My daughter is 6 and the message that EVERY little girl is a princess, no matter what your clothing or jewelry is like, or from where you grew up.  The movie, in a few parts, is a bit too 'unrealistic.'  But then again, that is why it is a movie!  The bottom line is that my daughter and I watch it often and always cry at the ending....  The love of a daughter and a parent truly transcends all.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Over and over its the one word you will hear. I love this series! I would have given it a five star but not all the shots are in HD. I have a ps3 with 32\\" sharp i use a HDMI, don't be a sucker you don't need a expansive HDMI I use a $20 one from apple and it looks and sounds as good as a monster cable.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|majority of songs are upbeat and just fun all around. like she said, its a summer album
B000OCXMAE|5.0|The songs i've heard so far, which is most are awesome, u will not be let down!!!!!!
1401307450|4.0|This book is a great read.  It spans the life of Anthony Kiedis in first person from birth, through his school years with Flea, the formation of his various musical ventures and the ups and downs of RHCP through the album By The Way.  There's sex, drugs, rock & roll with a little more sex and drugs thrown in on top.  It's obviously written from the viewpoint of an older, more mature and very reflective Kiedis, owning up to his faults and highlighting his many talents, while detailing his progression into and out of drug addiction.  If you love RHCP, you'll love hearing their story from the amazing front man.  If you've never heard of RHCP, you'll love the story of a man struggling to be the best person he can in a life of rockstar morals and hollywood dreams.  Definitely read this book.
B0000041Z5|3.0|I purchased this cycle with eager anticipation but was frankly disappointed when I opened up the set and popped it in my stereo.  I love the CSO/Solti sound (esp the brass section) as much as anybody but I am disappointed with the energy, balance, and precision of entrances and note lengths.  If you want a great set, buy the HSO/Eschenbach!
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Some people are down on this album, but those are probably the same kinds of people who have no real musical appreciation; ie the song has to be \\"radio worthy\\" before it passes their muster. I didnt even like their earlier work, everything sounded the same. This album is much more diverse. Of the 12 songs, only Given Up, Bleed it out (kinda), What Ive done, and No more sorrow <br />could be considered rockers. So its much different. But in my opinion, this is what makes an album, and not a singles collection. If you are a real LP fan, you'll pick this up, and i think youll really be happy with it. Im not a big LP fan, but i was interested because i heard it would be different, and it is, and i applaud them for sticking themselves out there.
B000MQ54OO|5.0|Awesome in HD!.  Good movie, telling storyline, upbeat music and dancing.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Linkin Park has gotten some new flowers for its gardens. The band seems to have gone into an expedition into what was popular for each of the past decades, with influences creeping in from 1969 to 1999. The band is now a chameleon that was once a larger, lumbering elephant of \\"nu-metal\\".<br /><br />Widescreen and epic, \\"Wake\\" opens the album, bubbling with keyboards that make you think who snuck the Pink Floyd record onto the turntable. As the various band members join in with their respective instruments, Phoenix ( on bass ) is immediately noticable as being higher in the mix than on previous albums. \\"Given Up\\" is our first taste of the band's new sound, possibly the most raw and organic thing the band has ever recorded. Near the end of the song, they go all Undertow-era Tool on us, Brad Delson's guitar recalling past LP song \\"A.06.\\"<br /><br />\\"Leave Out All The Rest\\" is the album's first ballad; just a tad manufactured sounding, but still heartfelt. The strings will really pull at you. \\"Bleed It Out\\" blasts open as a case of Boston and the Rolling Stones meets Tool and Nine Inch Nails. These guys are archaelogists greedily mining 70's dinosaur rock perhaps more than anyone in this decade yet.<br /><br />\\"Shadow of the Day\\" got me misty-eyed the first time I heard it. An orchestra plays, mixed with the most nostalgic, reverb-heavy, summer-of-1985 keyboards I could ever hope for. Of all the hundreds of U2 influences that have crept up the last few years, this one is the best I've ever heard. It's the new \\"With Or Without You.\\" It closes with a dark keyboard section that recalls early 80's Tangerine Dream. This segues right into...<br /><br />\\"What I've Done\\", the most \\"old Linkin Park\\" sounding song on Minutes To Midnight. A good choice as a single, as the lyric and video depict larger issues than past angst, while still retaining that younger, youthful -- dare I say it -- nu-metal sound from past records, which is really there to safely reel in the older fans that bought Hybrid Theory is junior high, but have now moved on to college. The \\"new Linkin Park\\" gets back into the game on \\"Hands Held High\\" with a slow, plaintive song featuring multiple harmonies and military drums, one of Mike Shinoda's only rapping songs on this record -- immediately recalling his work with side project Fort Minor. Haunting and a very personal lyric for the band. I see Shinoda's influence absolutely all over this song.<br /><br />\\"No More Sorrow\\" is a biting, finger-pointing tale of the current administration's flaming quagmire of the Second Iraq War. Whereas \\"Numb\\" ( Meteora, 2003 ) had a pleading, lost child look at those in authority, this song is pure anger, going straight for the jugular. Reminds me of early 90's Megadeth. \\"Valentines Day\\" is a perfect, catchy ballad, although it's softness right after the previous track is a little jarring. \\"In Between\\" features Mike Shinoda's first solo singing vocal on a Linkin Park recording, with no rapping whatsoever. I'm not too sure about this track, but kudos to LP for taking another chance.<br /><br />\\"In Pieces\\" is sort've a poppy techno song; Chester Bennington's influence is immediately made aware. By this point in the CD, the band has let loose with a cacophany of sounds and influences that are likely to be picked apart, scrutinized, and studied for years to come. The album's closer, \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\", opens with acoustic guitar ( yet another LP first ) coupled with the screetching bleeps and scratches of DJ Joe Hahn. The song builds and builds, guitarist Brad Delson slowly coaxing his guitar into the leagues of The Edge, David Gilmour, and Alex Lifeson. The song ends with multiple harmonies from the band as each instrument slowly fades out.<br /><br />Minutes To Midnight clocks in at roughly 43+ minutes, about 9 minutes longer than both previous albums. Yet, I can't help but feel that the time flew by too fast. That's it?

B000002GB2|4.0|This album came out during the time when drugs were still popular just after the 60's movement.  Many songs reflect the mood of the era where people just wanted to be free and enjoy life.  Lyrics are more story telling rather than just catchy soundbites.  Done befor the time of \\"gloom and doom\\". <br /> <br />The group is still exploring areas in music other bands seem to ignor.  Perfect for just kicking back and letting your mind wander as they take you to places in your mind only STYX can create.  The song \\"Midnight ride\\" is surprizing in that it is a hellacious rock song with good energy that is a departure from the other (mellow) themes in this album. <br /> <br />Likewise \\"Suite Madam Blue\\" became a famous \\"Power ballad\\" for STYX fans everywhere.  Starting with a \\"Stairway to heaven\\" style intro, leading you on a journey of sound that finally brings on a pounding ride that features a ripping guitar solo that even headbangers love.  It climaxs and finishes off almost where you started and leaves you thinking.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I'm a big fan of them and Aren't cursing the ground they walk on or anything but this is disappointing.  They were a band that you could count on to blend rap rock to great success with an over all self empowering  message without cussing.   <br /> <br />This albums starts tossing the f bombs from the get guy and sings about giving up on life.  It then transitions into a song we will probably hear covered on American Idol next season.   <br /> <br />Not how I hope a Linkin album to start.  Most of the rest of the album sounds like some pop alt band hoping to get their first radio hit.  When we finally get a rap song its not even a rap rock song it's an agonizingly annoying political protest rap with a chorus that sounds like the Mmm what ya say song from the dear sister parody. <br /> <br />I think all of this would be so much more acceptable if someone wasn't able to start and graduate from college between every new release from the band.  If you are going to make us wait this long it needs to be better than this.  Though I'm sure before we get the next album we will get the remix, instrumental, and live albums. <br /> <br />Hope they find their new voice next album
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I'M seeing all these bad reviews but i agree with the guy who wrote that this album will be green day's american idiot. i think its awesome.totally from begining to end
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Linkin Park just defficated on all their fans and wiped themselves with our faces after releasing this piece of garbage. <br /> <br />What the hell is this?  It has cussing and random organ sounds with amens on the same cd...what is this?  Mike Shinoda rapping?  C'mon, this sounds like the love child of AFI and Staind on glorious amounts of anti-depressants. <br /> <br />So they say they \\"grew up\\" so they don't want to make angry music. Yeh but I tell you,  that is one thing that made them good.  They are done. <br /> <br />Here's lies the good Linkin Park.  May they rest in peace.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|BEST LINKIN PARK ALBUM TO DATE!  <br />It can't be compared to Hybrid Theory or Meteora, because it's NOT the \\"same ol LP!\\" I've been anticipating this album since I embraced Meteora as one of my all-time favorite albums. I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED. Does that look strange? It may, because \\"I'm disappointed\\" is alot of what you'll see in reviews all over the net. It seems like the most close-minded people SADLY are also the most vocal. Get the album and listen to it all the way through, MULTIPLE times. Then YOU decide. I suggest the CD/DVD combo. The \\"Making Of\\" documentary is awesome, and really takes you inside the band to show how they arrived at this point. Must see. <br /> <br />FIRST: Throw away everything you think you know about Linkin Park.  <br />SECOND: Put on some headphones <br />THIRD: Press play   <br /> <br />1: WAKE- This IMO captures the entire history of the \\"LP sound\\" that so many have come to know and love, to show basically that this is the last you'll hear of it because... <br /> <br />2:GIVEN UP: Once this track starts, you're introduced into a ear-catching raw sound. Jingling keys and claps, no synths and electronic tones. It has a punk type vibe to it. Chorus makes it an instant \\"single\\" candidate. I won't spoil the surprise in this track. But i'll put it this way: Chester's vocals are not of this Earth. (10/10) <br /> <br />3:LEAVE OUT ALL THE REST: I overlooked this track on my first listen. But once I gave this album a thorough listen, it latched onto me and is now one of my all time favorite LP songs. It is a infectious mid-tempo ballad with a great hip hop drum beat. Chester once again shines on vocals. Simply beautiful. Would make a GREAT single if LP/WB chooses to release any slower songs as singles.(10/10) <br /> <br />4:BLEED IT OUT: It just stands out so boldly. There's just so many different eclectic elements blended together that fuse seamlessly into one of the most grooving, catchy LP songs to date. It features Mike rapping for all those starving for more flows to feel. Chester nails the chorus and bridge. They demonstrated some maturity by not taking this song over the top, and found just the right spots to hit vocally. It's short so it can definitely give the repeat button some use on your stereo. It was performed as the second song on their SNL appearance so I'm betting it's the next single.(10/10) <br /> <br />5:SHADOW OF THE DAY: Initially was the weakest track on the album in IMO. However, just today(I had the leak for two weeks prior :D)it has grabbed me and is one of those songs you can close your eyes and drift away to. Not what you'd expect on an LP CD eh? Though it does confirm those U2 comparisons you're seeing in most reviews. But that doesn't make it bad right? U2 is one of the greatest bands of all time by most people's vote. (Growing on me/10) <br /> <br />6:WHAT I'VE DONE: First single. You've probably already heard it. The song that bridges the gap. Has the classic LP song structure, but a more stripped down classic rock sound to it. Some love it, some hate it. I loved it instantly. I'm glad they went back into the studio and cut this track for the album. The video does a great job of showing what this song is all about.(10/10) <br /> <br />7:HANDS HELD HIGH: If you like George W. Bush, press the skip button. If you despise him as much as most, then the lyrics will really hit home and are some of the best from Shinoda thus far. Features all SIX members on the chorus to create a choir like effect. Very different for LP musically. But the lyrics carry this song to great heights. (9.5/10) <br /> <br />8:NO MORE SORROW: LISTEN TO THIS SONG! I don't have the words to describe it! Even if you don't wanna listen to the political lyrics, the music just pumps you up! The chorus, SMASHING! The refrain at the end will have you trying your hardest to mimic Chester's fantastic vocals. \\"your time has come to be replaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaced!!!!!\\" I LOVE IT! (10/10) <br /> <br />9:VALENTINE'SDAY: I don't know what it is, but I like this song. ALOT. Most people criticize this song for being too \\"pop\\" or \\"emo\\" or whatever. IT IS A GREAT SONG. Period. Great intro, great vocals. Gets heavier as the song progresses. A rockin crescendo.(10/10) <br /> <br />10:IN BETWEEN: Mike gets his sang on! He doesn't try to do things he's not capable of with his voice, so it comes off very well. He has this track all to himself and he does a great job.(8.5/10) <br /> <br />11:IN PIECES: One of my absolute favorites on the album. I am typically not a fan of fast tempo, punky type songs, but LP puts their twist on it and makes it sound very good. Brad hit a nice lil catchy solo on the bridge! This song was stuck in my head after the first listen. Just flat out GREAT! :D (10/10) <br /> <br />12:THE LITTLE THINGS GIVE YOU AWAY: There was so much hype and discussion about this song that I gained some lofty expectations and ideas of what it could sound like.(Brad's first solo, best LP song ever, yada, yada, yada) So when I first heard it and it sounded nothing like what I expected, I was slightly disappointed. However, ONCE AGAIN after a few listens and once expectations and notions were set aside, it quickly grew on me and became one of my favorites on the album. Must hear, another indescribable masterpiece. Great closer to the album. Is indeed the best song LP has done, and a great way to drive home the point that this new sound has arrived and is here to stay.(10/10) <br /> <br />And that's all folks. LP sticks to the 12 track formula.(the foreword on Meteora doesn't count :D) I wanted more immediately. Luckily, Brad said that the finished tracks that didn't make the cut may be released in the future. Keep your eyes open. MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT has the songs to rock out to, the songs to drive to, and the songs to listen to at night on the way to bed. All in all a very versatile album. Most complex, diverse and satisfying Linkin Park album. 5 STARS!!! <br /> <br />What I'm not understanding is why everyone is so shocked that this doesn't sound like \\"Meteora Theory\\" or basically a third album in the same vein of the predictable sound of the nu-metal genre. Especially when LP has been telling the media all along that they were looking to expand their horizons and try new things. And if I hear one more person say \\"I miss Mike's rapping! This sucks!\\" I'm gonna scream! Can people's memory be THAT bad that they forget... Crawling!(Mike---BACKING VOCALS!!!) Numb!(Mike---BACKING VOCALS!!!) One Step Closer!(Mike---BACKING VOCALS!!!) Breaking The Habit!(Mike---BACKING VOCALS!!!) GET IT? They could only ride that formula of \\"Mike on verses, Chester on Chorus, Mike and Chester exchange on bridge\\" for so long... That ride has ended! Jeez! Get over it! QWERTY was an experiment to see what else could be done with their OLD SOUND. The answer? Not much. While it is a good song, it does sound a bit tired. People are so quick to always try and compare things that are nothing alike and put down one thing because the other is what they're used to! So accept it or don't buy the album, there's no use in trying to crucify LP or any band because they didn't make something exactly, specifically, especially for YOU! So if you don't like it, listen to it a few more times. If that doesn't change your outlook, Hybrid Theory is still on the shelves at your local music store.

B000AADYRQ|5.0|My wife and I heard the tract \\"I'll Follow You Into the Dark\\" on Jay Leno and since August is our 44th Anniversary we thought it would be the perfect song to play at the renewing of our vows. Suprisingly the entire CD was as awesome as the one song we had heard and we've enjoyed every one on it. It's a little different than what we've always listened to, things like Steppenwolf and Led Zepplin, but we've become fans of \\"Death Cab For Cutie!\\"
B000N6TYLW|4.0|\\"Gilmore Girls\\" has finished its seventh and final season and now fans will have to wait patiently for it to come out on DVD to complete our sets (i.e., everybody reading this review is waiting to pre-order this set having already watched all of these episodes).  The seventh season has been the most disappointing one by far, and when it was announced on the eve of the series finale that the show was not coming back, I had convinced myself in my own mind that this was a good thing.  After Rory literally turned away from her mother at the end of the fifth season (\\"A House is Not a Home\\"), I really did not care about her again until she called up Mitchum Huntzburger and read him the riot act when Logan was in the hospital (\\"Super Cool Party People\\").  Then Lorelai ends the sixth season in Christopher's bed (\\"Partings\\") and I am spending almost the entire seventh season unhappy with her character.  Not as upset by the fact Lauren Graham never even received a single Emmy nomination, but enough to allow the heresy of hoping the show would be cancelled if this was what we were going to have to endure from here on in.<br /><br />I remain convinced that when creator Amy Sherman-Palladino walked away from the show that she put Lorelai in Christopher's bed as the season six cliffhanger knowing that the show would not be able to write its way out of that situation.  But it turns out that Graham, now also a producer for the show, argued for other romantic complications because she thought it made the story better.  I still maintain that breaking up Luke and Lorelai was the biggest mistake the show ever made, reducing it to being just another soap opera.  I thought the whole point of putting off the inevitable and devoutly wished for union of Lorelai and Luke for four seasons was that when it happened it would not be a deathblow to the romantic dynamic as it was on \\"Moonlighting.\\"  I remember when Luke was up on the roof telling Lorelai that he had to tell Rory about the engagement and that he was not happy being in the middle (\\"Fight Face\\"), and I saw this as clear evidence the two could still have funny fights as a romantic couple.  There was a bit of this at the end of the seventh season (\\"It's Just Like Riding a Bike\\"), but that just added insult to injury since it proves they could have been doing this all along.<br /><br />You see, for me a key element in a dramatic romance is the Grand Gesture.  Luke's Grand Gesture is to not only organize a surprise graduation/bon voyage party for Rory, but to stay up all night sewing together the tent because it is going to rain (\\"Bon Voyage\\").  What is Christopher's Grand Gesture?  To use his inherited money to pay a restaurant staff to get up in the middle of the night to make a fancy dinner for him and Lorelai (\\"French Twist\\").  Forget about Lorelai's inherent distrust about wealth and her carving out a life on her own financially, I want to know where is her moral outrage as a person who runs a successful inn over the sort of guest who would pull that sort of crap?  So Luke has Christopher beat from start to finish in the Grand Gesture department, but at least Christopher had one, which is more than we can say for Logan and his proposal to Rory (\\"Unto the Breach\\").  Talk about ending a relationship with a whimper.<br /><br />The ironic theme of season seven seems to be ignoring the obvious, of which Christopher is the most gifted, proving once and for all he is an outsider.  After all, Christopher seems to have no idea that Lorelai's friendship is forever (\\"To Whom It May Concern\\"), that she loves Stars Hollow as much as it loves her (\\"Knit, People, Knit\\"), and that Luke is still a better friend to Lorelai than Christopher is a husband (\\"I'd Rather be in Philadelphia\\").  If I could change one thing in the final seaon it would be having Christopher go to Luke, admit that he took advantage of Lorelai every step of the way and that he knows Luke is the right man of Lorelai.  Instead, Christopher sulks away (\\"Farewell, My Pet\\"), and it takes several episodes just to have Lorelai and Luke even acknowledge the elephant in the room let alone talk about it.  This delaying action increased my sense of frustration rather than heightened my anticipation towards a happy reunion.<br /><br />The CW's promotion of the series finale (\\"Bon Voyage\\") made the gross mistake of giving away what was going to happen with Lorelai and Luke (I would have loved to have heard a heartfelt comeback from her regarding his declaration that all he wants to do is see her be happy instead of going right for the kiss).  It should have been a moment we could enjoy, such as the big moment a couple of weeks earlier when Lorelai is singing \\"I Will Always Love You\\" to Rory on karaoke night and you just knew Luke was going to walk into the bar and she was going to end up singing it to him instead (\\"Lorelai? Lorelai?\\").  But the promos totally took away the sense of anticipation, and so the choice moments ended up being a couple of emotional exchanges between Lorelai and her parents, which reminds me: another problem was that Richard and Emily were woefully absent from episodes in the first half of the final season.  Good thing they were around for the end because it was what Richard said to Lorelai and what Lorelai said to Emily, along with the final scene bringing us full circle that finally persuaded me to round up on the seventh season (I guess I like the characters too much to stay mad at them forever).<br /><br />The last episode was supposed to work as either the season finale or the series finale, but it clearly leans towards the latter from start to finish.  I was worried that the show would forgo the opportunity to say goodbye, as it were, but the party for Rory covered that bet.  I also thought that when Christiane Amanpour she was going to serve as a \\"deus ex machina\\" to get Rory a job, but they did not go that route.  Then I was worried that they might do the whole \\"Six Feet Under\\" ending with Rory driving away into the future.  However, they went for a simple final scene, allowing viewers to project the futures they want onto the characters.  Of course, those wanting more explicit resolutions to various relationships will be underwhelmed.  I do wish that what I assume were to be the final two-word line that Sherman-Palladino had in mind for the series (to wit, \\"Thanks, Mom\\") had been uttered explicitly, but I think the sentiment is still there.topher sulks away (\\"Farewell, My Pet\\"), and it takes several episodes just to have Lorelai and Luke even acknowledge the elephant in the room let alone talk about it.

B000MCIBAW|4.0|\\"Strange Days\\" continued the breakout of the Doors, back in the flowering of the 1960s music scene -- which is admittedly a great place to start. Their sophomore album showed no signs of a slump, polishing up the rough blues'n'rock of their first album, and continuing into weirder, more intense territory.<br /><br />It opens with the dark, hallucinatory beauty of \\"Strange Days,\\" with Jim Morrison's rich voice singing distantly, \\"Strange days have found us/Strange days have tracked us down/They're going to destroy/Our casual joys...\\" His melancholy vocals are totally at odds with the energetic drums, keyboard and bouncy melody.<br /><br />It's followed by the affectionate-sounding \\"You're Lost, Little Girl,\\" and the deliciously stompy-bluesy \\"Love Me Two Times.\\" Having hooked listeners in, the Doors spill out a stream of bluesy rock'n'roll -- sometimes it's dusty and raw, and sometimes it's flavoured with keyboard. And at the end there's a haunting pair of slow, atmospheric rockers -- the darkly enticing \\"I Can't See Your Face in My Mind,\\" and the sprawling electrobluesy \\"When the Music's Over.\\"<br /><br />\\"Strange Days\\" does pretty much the same thing as the Doors' first album -- a catchy intro, blues-rocky middle parts, and a haunting, long outro that lingers in your mind. The big difference is that in this album, their music is less striking, but it is more polished and experienced.<br /><br />That polish is especially present in the music -- Robby Krieger played some brilliantly flexible guitar, whether it was lean rock riffs or a funky little tune, and John Densmore was equally good with some quirky drums. Ray Manzarek flavoured the whole thing with marimba and colourful waves of keyboard. Most of the time this worked -- the only real exception is the dark, mildly frightening \\"Horse Latitudes,\\" which is a good experimental track, but it feels out of place.<br /><br />But Morrison gave the music that extra boost into genius. He had a rich, full voice that could flower into a croon, a murmur, or an impassioned howl. And his songwriting was pretty much poetry, full of strange imagery and passions (\\"The face in the mirror won't stop/The girl in the window won't drop/A feast of friends/Alive, she cried/Waiting for me outside...\\").<br /><br />The Doors continued doing what they did best in \\"Strange Days,\\" a blend of blues and psychedelic rock'n'roll.

B000OCXMAE|3.0|By now I'm sure you've read all the bad reviews.  I admit that when I put in this CD and got to track 3, I almost heard the howls of pain from fans of rock-rap everywhere.  But as a lot of other reviewers pointed out, this is a \\"new direction\\" for Linkin Park.  Years before this album came out, during the long wait between Meteora and Minutes to Midnight, I'd heard that the new album would throw away the rock-rap persona in favor of more melodic music.  I couldn't have had any more anticipation.  Upon listening to it now, Linkin Park ultimately missed the mark. <br /> <br />The problem is not the lack of Mr. Hahn's samples or Mike Shinoda's rapping.  The problem is the production (that's you, Mr. Rubin) is just plain bland.  They could've gotten their melodies in the style of Meteora's \\"Easier To Run\\" or \\"Breaking The Habit\\".  Instead, we get \\"Shadow of the Day\\" which sounds like U2's \\"With or Without You\\".  I've listened to this album non-stop all day.  I have to say that the majority of it is just boring. <br /> <br />This is not to say there aren't any good points on the record.  Songs like \\"Bleed It Out\\" and \\"In Pieces\\" are instant classics, and the album's brilliant closing, \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\" is incredible.  Also very welcome are the guitar solos featured on the last two tracks, which give the music a breath of fresh air (along with Mike Shinoda's singing!). <br /> <br />But even with the good parts, the downer is that once the album really gets going, it ends.  Four years waiting, 100+ songs written, and we get a short 43-minute album. <br /> <br />I believe Linkin Park definitely did the right thing by moving away from rap-rock.  They knew that this genre is dead.  Their hearts were in the right place, but they missed the mark.  Hopefully the next record will have it all together.
B000N3SS80|5.0|Jennifer Lopez has had her ups and downs, but it is obvious that Marc Anthony has helped her blossom into everything we knew she was inside.    If you are under 30-years old, or more specifically, have not had many romantic adventures in your life - you will not identify with this album.  For the rest of us (women), she is our voice.      The album is comprised of romantic ballads, emotional pasts and honest (sometimes painful) self reflection.  I get the impression Jennifer Lopez dusted off those lovelife journals and pulled straight from the heart to create this incredibly poetic album.  And the sounds are simply mature.  The orchestral sounds and some of the more \\"rock\\" sounds are well paired with her lyrics.    If you do not undestand Spanish, find someone who can translate - trust me, it's worth the effort.  I translated for my English-only speaking family member, and she was just as emotionally affected as us Spanish speakers.     A freebie for those that want a taste:    Como Una Mujer Ama (How A Woman Loves) - Album Title -    Maybe I pressured myself  to step when I could not see ahead  and not allow the (old) wounds  to heal properly.  Maybe I was being impulsive  I've left so many things  that were part of the path  part of growing.  Maybe it is because I've been so alone for so long,  that I was in love with the Moon (some fairytale/dream)  that has been my only sin,  the sin of following my heart where ever it lead,  follow my reckless heart where ever it lead.    Chorus:  I have loved like a woman loves  who looks upon her man as paradise,  If I gave of myself, I gave everything  And if I fell, I started again  and when I picked myself up off that road (I kept walking, knowing)  I have loved like a woman loves  because I made sure never to have abandoned my soul    And those who try one more time  and those who dream of dreaming  and because of love they have made mistakes  and for love they have made mistakes    Maybe there wasn't enough room  to seeclearly ahead  that at the end of the day  I had (no choice but) to loose.  I've allowed myself to be swept up by the wind  to have lived in the moment  and when I could no longer rely on reason,   I continued with only (my) faith.    And simply for following this madness  how quickly the mad passion fades,  wanting so badly to believe in the moment  so that I don't fall or so it doesn't vanish me away  only to make me more strong.    (Repeat Chorus)
B000NQR7KM|4.0|I have listened to the SACD surround mix countless times and all I can say is WOW! I think this has been an underrated album and always thought it was a 4 star disc. Even though Peter Gabriel left the band after the previous album, this album still has a lot of very good progressive rock. While Steve Hackett was still in the band, the music was still good. I'm glad they included the concert footage from '76 too. I have a bootleg of this but it is nice to finally own an official copy (although the video and audio quality isn't any better). The DTS 96/24 surround mixes on the DVD are a little more brittle sounding compared to the SACD audio stream, but don't get me wrong, it still sounds very good. These surround mixes make the album more enjoyable, and the inclusion of many cool bonus features make this a fine release.  I recently listened to the CD layer of the SACD disc for the first time and I must say the 2004 remaster CD I own sounds better. This CD remaster has more dynamic range compression and it seems that there is some distortion in places that I didn't notice before. Overall, the mix sounds very harsh. The harshness is very evident when comparing side by side in Nuendo.  A word to the wise, if you buy this, hang on to you 2004 remaster for CD listening!

B000OCXMAE|4.0|I've been reading through reviews on here for the last 2 days and have noticed a common theme.  You either love it or hate it.  I've honestly liked this cd from the get-go and yes, I love their first 2 cd's.  I honestly believe an artist's 3rd album is hit or miss.  If they made Meteora part 2 or a combination of the first 2, it's \\"why did they do that?\\"  It would please a majority of the fans, but the album wouldn't have any longevity.  If they go in a new direction(as they did), they tick off and split fans but the rewards are more beneficial long-term.  I'm confident that maybe half of the people that \\"hate\\" it so far will come around, it may be something as simple as culture-shock. I understand.  This cd will have a much more lasting affect then one that sounded in similarity to their first two.  Something I highly recommend is buying the CD/DVD combo($16.99 as Best Buy through Saturday, May 19) and watching the making of.  It's very insightful and gives you a great look at what they endured to deliver this product.  I was left yearning for more!  Immediately, I wanted to go pop the cd in after watching the DVD.  These guys are here for the long haul and this cd is a testament of that.

Beginners will love the step-by-step (with photos showing each step) tutorials, and non-beginners will love the all-in-one reference of techniques and inspiring designs. <br /> <br />You'll be able to learn a number of techniques, including basic cane-making, mokume gane, inlay, marbling, etc. You'll also learn how to make faux dichroic glass, wood, leather, and a number of different faux gemstones. <br /> <br />Although some of the techniques are covered in other books, the photos outlining the steps in this book are very easy to follow for a beginner such as myself. That is the biggest difference between this book and others on polymer clay. The author takes the \\"guesswork\\" out of how to achieve the end result.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Let's have one thing straight from the beginning of this review before I explain why Minutes to Midnight deserves between 4-5 stars (5 in my opinion). Linkin Park has certainly changed it's sound except for they're song What I've Done. It is no longer true that they hold that sound most of us would say only Linkin Park could produce. They don't even dress the way they used too. Instead the album is more of an alternative rock / indie rock album, which is again reflected in their manner of dress and the booklet that comes with the DVD package of this CD. <br /> <br />However, consider that if it were some other band that just come out and this was their CD people would likely love it. The songs are still great. I think that all the bad reviews are coming more from people being dissapointed in the sound changing, it's NOT that the music is bad or lacking skill. It's that their expectations for a certain set of rythms was let down. <br /> <br />So if your going to purchase this CD be accepting to find a sound that is a bit more generic and not that original \\"only Linkin Park does it\\" type of sound. None the less I think you will enjoy this album if you come into it without predjudice and expectation for a certain style. The music is still great, the lyrics are still meaningful, and bads change so maybe they will merge their new sound with their old on their next album.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|It is too bad that Linkin Park's fan base is staying stuck in the past.  It had to happen, these talented dudes have grown musically to go beyond the head banging for head banging's sake trip.  Okay, maybe it's not the intense grunge-a-thon most were expecting, but give it a chance - you might be as pleasantly surprised as I am.
0345440900|3.0|I read many books on colic and sleep habits when my son was very young. <br /> <br />This one had some good tips in it, but they were more common sense than anything.   <br /> <br />It is so important to respect a baby's need for sleep, early bedtimes, and a schedule. I recommend \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child\\" by Marc Weissbluth. <br /> <br />He does allow for \\"spoiling and doting\\" until four months of age, but quite frankly, all these big fans of Dr. Sears are going to end up with alot of sleepless nights and a child who sleeps in their bed with them until college. Our child is very fond of us, has slept in his own crib since he was born, and was sleeping 12 hours a night since he was several months old. You can have your \\"attachment parenting.\\" <br /> <br />But this book is worth a try, I think.
0385512058|5.0|I was a non-believer in the whole networking strategy to business success, I was so blinded by my own ego that I didn't see that business and life success are both intimately tied to having better and more relationships with people.

This books learnings are so foundational to success and tactics so easily put into practice that I've employed them in the building of my small business and its been a major factor in my success. <br /> <br />My favorite sections to Never Eat Alone (the ones that continually reverberate in my head) are: <br />- Build it before you need it <br />- Don't keep count <br />& Share your Passions <br /> <br />There is no more useful business book or video on the market today.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Being a strong supporter of Linkin Park from when they were called Hybrid Theory,  I believe they have taken a step backwards with their music.  What made them stand out in their past albums were their rhythmic beats and flashy intros.  However, after completing my first listen through of Minutes to Midnight, it seemed like all 12 tracks lacked strong intros and melody.  The chorus is very Thirty Seconds to Mars like, in that it lacked that usual Linkin Park intensity and fire. A couple months ago, I heard one of their other songs going around on the internet called Qwerty.  After listening to that song and knowing that they were looking towards changing their style, I was anticipating more metallic rather then a soft alternative rock.  Overall, for those who haven't purchased this album ----> save your money.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|I've seen a lot of people bashing this new album but I happen to really like the new direction. This new album is four years coming. When Meteora was released I heard all this talk about how it was just another Hybrid THeory and they didn't do anything new. Now all the negative reviews are hating on this album because it is new and unique. Linkin Park fans will really appreciate this album after a few listens. Those that are true LP fans know to judge them based on thier live performances as well and watching the concert on AOL Music shows how great the new album is. There was a definate shortage of Mike on voacals and Joe Hahn on the beats but that doesn't mean they still aren't a huge part of the band. If you want more of the Hybrid Theory/Meteora sound I suggest getting the Live in Texas Album. There is nothing wrong with putting more rock into their sound. THey have perfected the rock rap genere and are showing their range by moving on. If you buy the special edition MVI/DVD you should watch the Making of Minutes to Midnight and the band will explain why this sound is so different.
B00004S3AN|5.0|Sony/Columbia did this superb sounding disc very well in this SACD transfer!  This rivals the original edition Lp for lovely sound, and I think it is among the best single layer SACD's out there (Mingus ah um is THE best to these ears!). You know (or should know) the music, so don't hesitate getting it on SACD!  I should add I am not into 5.1 for music. My sound review refers only to 2 channel stereo sound.

0684859106|5.0|I bought this book after my sister made a birthday cake using the recipe for Traditional Birthday cake.  After one bite I was hooked and demanded the recipe.  After making this one a few times, I went ahead and bought the book.  I usually make cupcakes, though, and the cake is sweet all on its own -- like a sugar cookie but with a cake texture.  We just tried the \\"Dump Cake\\" -- an inelegant but super easy desert.  My kids made it with minimal supervision (8 years, 6 years, and 4-year-old twins.)  We served it warm out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, like a cobbler.  Today we're baking cookies!
B000001FN3|3.0|The first of The Alan Parsons Project albums set the footprint for his career to follow: choose a concept and then base progressive, highly structured and immaculately produced music around it. In the case of \\"Tales Of Mystery,\\" it was Edgar Allan Poe. My original copy of this was on vinyl, a reissue of the 20th Century Records release with a second version of the cover, depicting a bust of Parsons somewhat wrapped in mummy-bandages. (The long shadow on the CD cover minus the mummy photos was the original cover.) Featuring several of APP's soon to be regular cast, collaborator Eric Woolfson and members of the groups Ambrosia (Parsons produced the debut \\"[[ASIN:B00003TKGH Ambrosia]]\\") and Pilot, it was the kind of album that got labeled \\"head music\\" in the seventies. Perfect for listening to with headphones or while hanging out with friends in a room full of black light posters while probably not 100% sober.<br /><br />Some 30 years later and more often sober while listening to CD's, this album holds up well for its first half. The trademarks of APP appear in songs like \\"The Raven\\" and the instrumental \\"Dream Within A Dream.\\" There was even a minor hit single as \\"The System Of Doctor Tarr and Professor Feather\\" slipped into the lower reaches of the top 40. The album's final Beatlesque ballad, \\"To One In Paradise,\\" sounds worthy of Abby Road and is indicative of hits to come - think of \\"Time.\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, the 15 minute \\"The Fall Of The House Of Usher\\" is a soundtrack in search of a video accompaniment. While a younger and more - ummm... - 'stimulated' imagination might have filled in the picture, it now just sounds like background buzz. While I don't mind the stentorian narration Parsons added from Orson Welles for the 1987 CD release, the additional synthesizers and solo guitars are an irritant. They could have left well-enough alone, but since CD technology was the shiny new thing at the time, I don't blame Parsons for wanting to tweak the new version. After all, I still have my 12 inch vinyl.<br /><br />As far as its place in the APP discography, I probably prefer \\"[[ASIN:B000002VC5 I Robot]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B000002VCT Pyramid]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000IOM1Y6 Eye in the Sky]]\\" ahead of \\"Tales Of Mystery.\\" But for shear audacity (mixing classics of literature with rock music was considered pretty risky in 1976), the Alan Parsons Project debut still can stimulate.I still have my 12 inch vinyl.

0374105235|5.0|This is one book that I doubt I will ever forget having read. It is a disturbing book but with a hopeful end. It is a description of a place where most of us have never been and pray to God, never will be.

B000002LCE|5.0|Following the abrupt departure of guitarist Vivian Campbell in the middle of the Sacred Heart tour, there was severe doubt amongst Dio fans as to whether the band could continue on without him. 1987's Dream Evil was the first Dio album to be released after Campbell left the band, and it put any doubts to rest once and forever.    This was the first Dio album to feature Craig Goldy on guitar. I know I'm going to get myself into trouble here, but he's my favorite Dio guitarist INCLUDING Vivian Campbell. He has quite a different approach to playing guitar than Campbell; his playing is thoughtful and melodic whereas Campbell is all fire and passion. Goldy writes great riffs that remind me of Ritchie Blackmore, and his solos have melody lines that I can hum. All three of the albums he's done with Dio (Dream Evil, Magica, and Master Of The Moon) are killer. As for the rest of the band, this was the last Dio album to feature the dynamite rhythm section of Vinny Appice (drums) and Jimmy Bain (bass), and they're as amazing as ever. Bain in particualar delivers a career-defining performance here. Keyboardist Claude Schnell is more apparent here than on any other Dio album except Sacred Heart, and his playing is inventive and athmospheric. Ronnie James Dio outdoes himself on this album. This is one of his finest vocal performances on record. The production isn't quite as good as the Dio's earlier releases. Dio seems to be going for a darker sound, and it winds up sounding a bit muddy in places. The bass isn't terribly well recorded.    This recording features some of the best songs in the Dio catalog; it amazes me that the band doesn't play these tunes much in concert these days. \\"All The Fools Sailed Away\\" is a great heavy ballad and definitely the best track here, \\"Night People\\" and \\"Faces In The Window\\" are kick-butt rockers, and other stand-outs include the riff-rocker \\"Dream Evil\\" and the highly melodic \\"Naked In The Rain\\". Every track on here is great. The only thing I can really complain about is a kind of awkward chorus on \\"Sunset Superman\\", but it really doesn't ruin the song. A lot of people complain about \\"I Could Have Been A Dreamer\\" but although it is kind of popish I still like it; it's a really GOOD pop song.    GET THIS ALBUM. This is a great metal masterpiece, and ranks only slightly below Holy Diver as Dio's finest offering.
B000E6UWE4|5.0|I started another multi-volume epic fantasy, \\"The Malazan Book of the Fallen\\". It's Steven Erikson's projected ten-volume series and the first book, The Gardens of the Moon is superb. Talk about total immersion into a new world. The word \\"epic\\" was created to describe this book. The book's physically huge, and its scope is no less so. I usually don't like books that have maps, glossaries, \\"dramatis personae\\" and the other accoutrements of this sort of thing. But every once in awhile one comes along that transcends the genre. There are battles galore, none of which are necessarily \\"fun\\", political intrigue, world-building on a scale that only an anthropologist (as the author is by profession) could do and the whole thing is populated by some amazingly well-delineated characters. In all, it's beautifully done. And the maps, glossaries and \\"dramatis personae\\" are all useful tools for enjoying the story.<br /><br />Night Shade Books is bringing out the first U.S. editions of Erikson's \\"sidebar\\" series to the \\"Malazan Book of the Fallen\\". First published in England by PS Publishing, there will be six short novels which will eventually be collected into a single volume. I've read the first, Blood Follows, and it is excellent, but I highly recommend you read Gardens of the Moon first or you may find yourself lost.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|Minutes to Midnight. I am not sure what to say. Being a true fan from the beginning I even fell into the trap of enjoying that nonsense that is Linkin Park and Jay-Z. <br /> <br />Though, I am beginning to think LP's days and sound of Hybrid Theory are finished. <br /> <br />4 years I waited...for this...an album which mimics the horrors that the entertainment business is producing these days. Don't get me wrong I do enjoy the album, or else I wouldn't have given it even 3 stars, let alone giving it the time of day to review it. But where is the band that I fell in love with 6-7 years ago? <br /> <br />I didn't buy this album to listen to Fort Minor or even \\"mainstream\\" rock. I long for the cutting guitar riffs, tasteful yelling and screaming, and rap all integrated into one harmonious piece of the likes of \\"Paper Cut\\" and \\"Lying from You.\\" The originality that was Linkin Park seems, to me, to have gone by the way-side. <br /> <br />Favorites: \\"What I've Done\\", \\"Shadow of the Day\\", \\"Leave Out All the Rest\\" <br />Biggest let down: \\"Hands Held High\\" (this song might as well be on Fort Minor's album)
B000NVIGC0|5.0|It might be tempting for some to call this Wilco Lite, but don't be fooled by the laid back feel of this release. The yearning desperation is still there in Jeff Tweedy's vocals, and Nels Cline's guitar work is nothing short of amazing. Combined with the individual talents of the rest of the band, they hit another home run. This has to one of the most melodic and tuneful CD's in their catalog without the sound effect trappings of Yankee Hotel. I'll put this one beside Summerteeth and will enjoy it equally even if for different reasons. Standout tracks: Impossible Germany, Side With The Seeds, Hate It Here, What Light and On and On and On. But they are all great. Buy it, it's worth every penny. Thanks Wilco for carrying on the torch of those that came before you. Thanks for playing real music that matters.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|I can't believe all the people on here saying this album is the worst ever. Just like everything else a band must grow and mature. I like the old albums, especially Hybrid Theory, great for it's time and certainly a modern classic. BUT LP can't stay the same forever. After hearing the whole new album a couple of times, it is nice to hear the guys playing more then just power chords, and I enjoy the diversity of Minutes. However if you LOVE the sound of old LP, and don't want to hear a much more complex and beautiful album then I suggest you forget all about the new one-
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Minutes to Midnight is a definite change from the HT and Meteora formula. I was all about the LP when they first came out but looking back on it; this is the first album that actually showed some musical progression. MT and Meteora were all about the power chords, screams, and the nu-metal stigma with mike's rapping. With Minutes LP is starting to show that they are not a run of the mill talent-less nu-metal band. They play real chords have guitar solos and with Rick Ruben's help definitely made one of the more progressive albums that you will see in the main stream music industry. Look at it this way, had they produced another HT or Meteora everyone would be complaining they didn't change. Embrace their musical growth.  <br /> <br />In comparison to the previous 2 albums, the guitar work is way way way better, cleaner chords, actual solos (some good ones at that). The vocals feature Chester's amazing voice, but it needs more of the crunch that he usually comes with. And I do miss the straight up rap rock songs like place for my head and faint. Drums....eh they're alright, Rob is no Danny Carry or Neil Peart. Don't know what happened to Hahn, but again that's them shedding the nu-metal stigma and progressing. And finally, the lyrics; they are much better than HT, and slightly better than Meteora, they have a little more flair and it is not hard to beat the lyrical intricacies of one step closer. <br /> <br />Yes Minutes to Midnight is a change, get over it...they didn't sell out (they're a mainstream platinum selling artist on a major label from the start...cant really sell out from that)....they sat down in a studio instead of a tour bus and created something that they wanted to do and that is what matters most. Take it or leave it <br />
B00003CXPD|5.0|I wasn't too sure how I would enjoy a story about a 13 y/o boy but right from the start I was hooked on it. I first watched this movie when I borrowed it from a friend but I quickly knew I had to have a copy for myself. \\"Billy Elliot\\" takes place at time and place that give the story a powerful background and places it deep in to the culture of the English working class. The characters feel real, the music is great, the dancing is full of energy and the plot keeps you in the story. Billy's family is fully of love shown in the caring they have for each another and the lengths they will go to support one another. I highly reccomend this movie to anyone that likes a good ending. It is great for the whole family. Enjoy!
B000OCXMAE|3.0|for those of you who liked hybrid theory and meteora do not waste your money. this album is nothing like the previous releases. chester has lost his edge singing more ballads than anything else. mike shinoda's voice is barely even heard as he only raps on 2 songs and they are not the rap rock crossbreeds that we all liked so much. they resemble the weaker songs from the fort minor album. now if you did not like the first 2 albums and you like rock ballads than by all means go purchase this cd. as far as my 3 star rating goes, as a linkin park fan i give it 1 star. as a music fan i give it 3 stars. its not a bad album. its just not linkin park. for some, change is good. for linkin park change is definitely not good. hopefully on their next release they will remember what made them famous and return to it because now instead of being standouts in the music world, they just kind of blend in.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|If you own an HD DVD player, this is a must have title.  The footage of nature presented here is spectacular and will hopefully build an appreciation for our natural resources in viewers' minds.  For the price that Amazon is charging, its a bargain and I can't think of any reason to not make this part of your home theater experience.
B000001OAA|1.0|For once, we have truth in advertising. For that alone, if I didn't impose a rigid 1- or 5-star rating system on culture, since life is black or white and never gray, I would have given this album a 2. It truly is garbage, not food-scrap rubbish -- we would have to be reviewing something more patently offensive like Wolfmother, Fergie or Smashing Pumpkins 2.0 to reach that rancid level -- but the old stuff you throw out because it's inferior to the new stuff you can finally afford to replace it. This truly is a dime-store supergroup whipped up by corporate executives high on superglue. I hear Shirley Manson performed a pretty good trick involving golf balls before thrift-store king Herb Alpert tossed a bag of money at her hairy feet. If you're into phone-sex crooning over a neverending sonic slab of bubble-gum yummy feedback fuzz, this crud's for you.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I think this album almost sounds like a cross between Vapor Trails, Rush's last album and Counterparts, an album of their's released in about 1993 - but it has a few twists of it's own. Many of the songs on the Counterparts album had a plodding heavy metal dirge feel that many of the songs on this album also have. The high points of this album to me are the instrumentals, they are well written and executed, it's obvious the guys spent considerable time and energy crafting them into something special. What I found especially refreshing was the use of an acoustic guitar and a mandolin which gave the album a more organic, down to earth feel.     My biggest problem connecting with Rush's music lately has been their dependence on adding multiple layers of electric guitar and vocals. I don't often hear anything I can really recognize as a guitar in their songs, just a big distorted wall of guitar like sound. Some people may like that, but it's not for me. Most of the time I am unable to discern in those multiple layers what the guitarist Alex is playing or trying to express, so I simply can't connect. I would rather have them use some basic keyboards to enhance their sound than all the layers. On past albums Rush used keyboards to make their songs more interesting and yes, I think musical. The vocals, especially background vocals, are so heavily layered that Rush sounds like they are accompanied by a choir. It made me wonder who kept making the decision in the studio to add yet again another vocal layer, or another guitar layer, and why. The vocal harmonizing sounds contrived when it's the same voice layered over and over. It's as though they are overcompensating for a deficiency that I believe doesn't exist. To be certain Geddy does not possess the high, powerful range of his youth but what he may be lacking in that dept. is more than made up for now with his increased control and ability to express a song's lyrics at a much more mature and deeper level. There is one song in particular on this CD where you can really hear Geddy's voice shine through without the multi tracking - needless to say I throughly enjoyed it, but it only left me wishing for more. I don't want to keep bashing the point, nor do I wish for Rush to sound like they did in their previous albums - I only want them to sound good now.    The overall sound of their songs are lacking in clarity. After finishing Rush's CD I popped in an old Stevie Wonder CD from the early 70's. The comparison in sound quality was like night and day. Suddenly I could clearly hear the notes of the individual instruments; and the vocals, not having a multitude of layers, sounded clear and genuine. I would like to see Rush minimalize their approach to recording...less is more.    In addition, four or five of the songs on the CD sound so similiar they actually could have been whip stitched together to create one very long song. The tempos for these songs are too slow for my taste and do not project much energy. They are in my opinion uninteresting....throw aways.    If you're a Rush fan sorry for the criticisms, but I take what this band does to heart and have to be real in stating my opinions here. The upside is I believe this to be a step in the right direction from Vapor Trails.
0440241413|5.0|This book was un-put-downable - I became a reading-aholic! It was funny, charming, sweet, and eerily familiar.  <br /> <br />I'm a lot more sensible with my money than Becky but I certainly understand where she's coming from, and her daydreaming is so funny cos it's so true eg. 'this chap isnt as nasty as I thought... maybe we'll become friends and I'll get to know his daughter, and through her connections with the TV industry I'll get a job in television and I'll go round there for dinner and help her mum do a salad..' - awesome stuff! <br /> <br />The author is obviously a fan of Helen Fielding who wrote the Bridget Jones books, but it pays off - the girlie English humour is priceless (unlike those Prada sunnies - they have a price tag) <br /> <br />If you like good chick lit and a good giggle, this is the book for you!
B000NDIAWO|5.0|This cd is GREAT, with song like Listen, Beautiful Liar, Irreplaceable, Flaws and all and more, is just PERFECT
B000O178BY|3.0|This new NIN album was an unexpected surprise since I had barely heard it was coming out before 'there it was.' Unlike many people I actually enjoyed a lot of With Teeth, With Teeth was a bit more commercial but the songs were creative and well written. To me the biggest problem with Year Zero (and I can appreciate the possible perspective from my being a songwriter as well) is that it seems like it was written to prove a point. Namely Trent began writing the album on a little lap top computer. Somehow to me it sounds like part of the 'challenge' to Trent was to see IF he could program the entire album on computer without using any real time musicians, especially drummers.    Now I know Josh Freese plays on the opening track (really ANYONE could have played that simple beat) but after that the album could have really used a human element, real drums and a real bass as well. So many of the tracks sound like Trent created a techno landscape and then wrote some simple melodies over the top thinking the electronic landscapes were interesting enough.     Unfortunately they're not. Maybe the 'all programmed' tracks were supposed to intentionally show the lack of a human element for the lyrical theme of the music but in the end the performances are just a little too cold and flat.    Musically (compositionally) the songs are too simple and unimaginative, straight beats, straight rhythms, predictable choruses right where you assume they're gonna be. And often the songs sound like he's borrowed musical ideas he already used on With Teeth.    But in the end its still a decent album. And for me often the new music will take on a higher polish when its played live by real players. I just wish NIN could finally record something using  live musicians more.  A new album doesn't in any way negate what an artist has created before and if this is what held Reznor's interest in the last few years more power to him. Hopefully as he perhaps finds out that his fans still support him he'll be willing on the next album to take some bigger and less commercial musical chances with his music. I sense that he has better and more interesting music in him. I'm just waiting for him to let it out!

B000OCXMAE|2.0|Having listened to LP for their first two CDs as well as the Reanimation disc, I can say for a fact that this album is a letdown for anyone expecting the same Linkin Park.  Every band's sound evolves and changes over time, but this is lacking to the Nth degree.   <br /> <br />The same song structure is used all too often, as was the case throughtout the first two CDs.  The problem here is that the music just isn't as hard as it used to be.  This would be fine if the lyrics could move it forward, but the lyrics are mostly weak, uninspired, and can't do the job of driving the music at all.  Chester takes most of the vocals, which is fine, but Mike is underused as a result.  It really sounds like they're trying to throw stuff at a wall to see what sticks... <br /> <br />If you're a die-hard, you might like it more.  But for someone like me who listens to the band only every now and then, its farewell Linkin Park.
B000NA77YO|5.0|This is a must have for any serious metal fan. The live show is awesome too, Dio delivers like he's 21 LOL <br /> <br />Go grab it, you won't be disappointed!! <br />
B000OCXFCO|5.0|This is the Megadeth that I enjoyed from the past.  Dave has a great band behind him again.  As much as I like Al Pitrelli, I never thought of him as a Megadeth guitarist.  Marty will always be my favorite Megadeth guitarist, but Glen Drover is a close second.  Chris Poland was great too.  He was the original lead.  I like that Dave has gone back to a more thrashy melodic style.  I can't believe the bass player is James LoMenzo from White Lion.  Great bass playing man!  I really recommend this cd!!

Ender's Game is one of his best .... and be sure to read the books that follow in the Ender's series.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Wilco albums have now become events.  You wait to see which avenue the talented Midwestern band is going to explore.  SKY BLUE SKY is an album worth the wait, but a bit of a shock, in that this one does not follow the more experimental trajectory of the last two releases.  SBS seems to revisit the familiar, but fertile fields of BEING THERE and SUMMERTEETH to great effect.<br /><br />Such a retro move would be disappointing if it were not for the great songs and strong playing.  Tweedy has once again delivered a set of  songs that both challenge the listener to interpret, plus will hold up to repeated listening listening. His songwriting has a open, warm feeling that has been missing from his last few releases. The band delivers solid arrangements highlighting Nels Cline's agile, if a little emotionally cool guitar workouts (most notably IMPOSSIBLE GERMANY).  This version of Wilco, is in my opinion, the strongest musically and support the songs well, using muscle in the right areas (WALKEN, SHAKE IT OFF) and finesse in others (SKY BLUE SKY, WHAT LIGHT, ON AND AON AND ON).  The song WHAT LIGHT may be one of the most beautiful songs that Tweedy has written.  The song talks about when one releases art to the public, that one loses possession of it, but not to worry let the angst of that situation get you down.<br /><br />I've only had the chance to hear it a few times through, but at this point SKY BLUE SKY stands with SUMMERTEETH and YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT at the top of the Wilco catalog.  It's a solid album, perhaps one of the best we'll hear this year.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I can be more bias since I just picked up their Meteora CD last week and this one on Tuesday.I can understand why so many fans would not be happy with this cd since it sounds nothing at all like the last. <br />But groups change and LP might trying to get hold of another audience,like myself.I listen too Bon Jovi and Nickelback mostly,not to big with rap since I think it's overexposed and rap/rappers all start sounding alike from Eminem,LimpBizquick,etc,etc, <br /> <br />Linkin Park are not the greatest singers but if you're an open-minded music lover,you will enjoy this cd.Little more singing and less rap lyrics never broke a group.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|All of LP's previous stuff has been exemplary, including even the Jay Z mix and the 4 fan-special volumes. <br /> <br />This album from another group might get 2-3 stars but from LP gets one because it's an atrocity to their name. I would have called LP my favorite group, but this is just really bland and boring and to have waited so many years...what a shame. <br /> <br />Too bad, their reign was for a long time, but it seems every group has to fall from grace at some point. Let us just say a solemn prayer for the late LP and remember them when they were good and not destined for the closing credits on a teenage drama.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Only three things to be said:<br /><br />1. This is easily the fastest, most aggressive album from Megadeth in seventeen years. Their sound is completely fresh and alive. It is also very Megadeth. That is all you need to know before buying it. Pick out your favorite parts yourself.<br /><br />2. Alot of folks might disagree with me here, but the only unnecessary moment on the entire record is the remake of ATLM. Very cool song, but it seems to temporarily break the pace of the album. It should have been a b-side and maybe the cover of Out On The Tiles should have been in it's place. I say maybe because I haven't heard it yet. But, in the end I will get OOTT at some point, so who really cares?<br /><br />3. I wrote the following response to the fellow below and any that might follow who question the hard brass of the lyrics:<br /><br />I must say, you haven't given yourself time to swallow the lyrics completely just yet, and perhaps you are also politically ill informed. I detest Bush and his cronies, have voted democrat every election in my life, but agree the U.N. is a useless pile of garbage and the institution should be competeley restructured, top to bottom. And I see nothing rightwing about expressing strength in the face of your enemies; like it or not, because of Bush our world is now full of them. Besides, look at the album art closely, and look into the album art of the past, and the lyrics of the past, and you will find yourself completely unsurprised that the nature of Megadeth's current nihilistic views have been there all along (and Dave, although no leftist, is decidedly against the neocons, having cynically mocked both Bush administrations on two occasions - CTE and TSHF), and if you are surpised by this, you have no business reviewing a Megadeth record.<br /><br />Now go get it.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This is an awesome album from the boys of Agoura Hills! I think Minutes to Midnite will greatly expand their fan base. This is one of their most melodic albums thus far, and incorporates true artistry that will make them a lasting band. True musicians know how to be diverse, and Linkin Park will be around for a long, long time!
0553213105|5.0|I hesitate to assign such titles but this is my favorite book of all time.  Austen is so witty and subtle that each re-reading garners more laughs and more cringes as the Bennet family unconsciously embarasses themselves in polite society.  Darcy is an ideal, a supremely satisfying hero for the headstrong, opinionated, and likeable Elizabeth.  The A&E miniseries adaptation is also excellent (a nice excuse to curl up on the couch for several hours on a rainy day), as was, to my surprise, the later Keira Knightley version.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I've enjoyed this every time I've seen it on PBS (the first time I saw only the end and was later delighted that it was re-shown), so I bought a copy.  The women are superb musicians (as are the backups), and, as a musician, I recommend this disk most highly.  If you like Celtic music and women's voices (solo and ensemble), you will love this.
0330491938|4.0|This is the first Tom Wolfe novel I've read, and I had a preconceived notion of southern literature along the lines of Styron or Faulkner.  This novel is more Olivia Goldsmith than Carson McCullers, and I have to admit I loved it.  Wolfe's detailed inner dialogues were addicting, and I followed each of the characters with varying degrees of sympathy, admiration or disgust, but never boredom.  He describes the world of his story to such an exact amount of detail that I feel like I could now write a novel of New York in the '80's (or at least Tom Wolfe's version of it).  I was hoping desperately for a neat and happy ending, and I was both pleasantly surprised and disappointed with the resolution.  Quick, satisfying read.
0060987464|4.0|I really wish that I had read this book sooner.  It seems so out of date now; I wonder what he is up to now.  It was an interesting read; I don't really know what he was trying to tell us or not tell us through the book.  Just seemed like any other kid that wanted to be a rockstar, and when he actually made it, kept up the stereotype of one.  Well written, it was a quick read for me.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|a creative and mysterious offering that bespeaks volumes about the pain, suffering, love and joy that these journeymen have experienced through the years. They really are survivors in more ways than one, capturing the elusive nature of enlightenment, or the striving toward enlightenment. Rush has always been the thinking person's choice of rock, managing to powerfully activate so many sensations with their music: cognitive, rhythmic, mystical...multiple nerve centers stimulated.<br /><br />While they take us into newer and richer aural landscapes with each release, I still long for those single rockers that explode with energy. Perhaps I need to give this one a few more listens. It is growing on me in sinuously magical ways.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I've loved Linkin park for 6 years now, and still have the first 2 cd's on my playlists after all this time... but this cd is completely different. <br /> <br />First of all, like others have said, those tracks like \\"in the End\\" and \\"Faint\\" don't really exist in this cd, sadly. <br /> <br />Second, the lyrics are crap. It's a lot of political, anti-war, anti-bush nonsense. I hate wars and Bush as much as the next guy my age, but I don't want to hear it in music. I much preferred the angst ridden, depressing, and self realization lyrics of the prior cd's. <br /> <br />Third, wtf? <br /> <br />So yeah, I like about 4 songs on it, so far. However, like The Open Door, I'll probably adjust after listening to it more and more.

B000N6TX1I|3.0|Science fiction is always about the present.  This has been true since the beginning of science fiction.  It has to be true since we can only extrapolate from the present to the future.  Only rarely, once in a million tries perhaps, does somebody come up with something truly original, or something unpredictable.  Leonard Da Vinci foresaw submarines, but if you think about it, he had the example of turtles, whales and dolphins.  Who foresaw nuclear energy? Who foresaw electricity and all that it can do?<br /><br />So this is about the present.  The refugee camp could be in Palestine.  The round up of immigrants is what many people in Europe and the US want.  It may happen tomorrow; in fact it is happening to some extent.  The irony and perhaps the illogic of this film is that with no babies being born, now for eighteen years, there is no labor force coming on to do the grunt work of society.  So why are the Brits in a frenzy of anti-immigration?  Apparently because of a fascist government has come to power.<br /><br />This reminds me a bit of something from Terry Gilliam who directed 12 Monkeys (1995) and Brazil (1985).  There is something about the decadent and bombed out feel of the scenes that is the same.<br /><br />This is a film for the underdog, for the oppressed.  It is in a symbolic sense a statement about aging Europe with its declining birth rates needing the fertility of people from southern climes, people of color to save the world from extinction.  In Europe today there are countries with birth rates so low that their populations are declining.  In both Europe and the US it is immigrants who are supporting the declining populations which are increasingly old.  In the US we have winked at the influx of illegal immigrants for decades because those in power know two things: (1) cheap labor is good for their bottom line; and (2) without young people paying into social security, the system will go bankrupt.<br /><br />The sets were exquisite, the battle scenes in the refugee camp seemed as authentic as the nightly news, well focused and involving.  The camera work was outstanding and carefully set up.  Michael Caine as the aging hippy was perfect.  I saw him recently in The Prestige (2006) and I have to say, he is like a man with a new career in his mid-seventies.  Claire-Hope Ashitey, who played Kee with her big eyes and her fresh face and her reserved style was also very good.  Clive Owen looked as heroic as the part demanded, and Julianne Moore in a limited role was good.<br /><br />There was some corniness in the movie and some politically correct stuff, like Kee braiding the old woman's hair and our hero being sensitive enough to be a midwife (today's men are above and beyond the purely macho).  There is also a root for the underdog feel throughout with the good guys (relatively speaking) being outsiders.  The scene where the government troops stand in awe of a baby's cry was striking (imagine how Spielberg would have milked this!), but I suspect that somebody, at hearing of the first human birth in over eighteen years, would have ignored the resumption of fire and stayed with the only woman on earth who was fertile.  I think everyone would have wanted to protect her and her baby.<br /><br />A nice touch that director Alfonso Cuaron could have brought to the film was to show us people doing extreme things in their desperation to have children, worshipping icons of fertility maybe, acting out weird rituals while imbibing strange concoctions.  Instead of just showing some religious demonstrators blaming the lack of human fertility on sinfulness, we might have gotten a glimpse of fertility cults drinking the essence of goat eggs or rhino horns as they danced around some fertility symbol.  Maybe there could have been a national health crisis as myriads of people, especially women, went crazy or committed suicide because of depression brought on by infertility.  Actually there was a hint of this in the movie but it wasgreatly underdeveloped.<br /><br />Another problem with this film (from my POV; for others this might be a plus) is that the direction relies heavily on action sequences.  There are chase scenes (and a nice car door opening gimmick used twice, once to knock the bad guys off their motorcycles, and once to knock down one of the fishes holding a gun).  But there was little subtlety in the story.  Most of the subtlety in the movie is in the scenes themselves and in the camera work.  And the characters are rather one-dimensional.  Theo (Clive Owen) is merely heroic.  He fights through the bullets and the other obstacles to help Kee and her baby.  Kee herself is hardly developed at all.  Michael Caine's character Jasper is the only one with any real depth.<br /><br />Two final points: I don't think this film is nearly as interesting as Cuaron's Y tu mama tambien (2001), and I would not dream of watching this film without subtitles since a lot of the dialogue is almost inaudible to these ancient ears.<br /><br />By the way, a discussion of why women were infertile and how the movie differs from the book can be found at the IMDb.e but it was greatly underdeveloped. <br /> <br />Another problem with this film (from my POV; for others this might be a plus) is that the direction relies heavily on action sequences.

B000GFRDN6|5.0|Steve Miller is timeless!!!  I remember owning the 8 track (I am dating myself), the LP, the first CD - and now the re-release.  Go back in time when rock was king (and not over sampled electronica).  Get this CD, gather your buddies, get in the car and take off on a road trip jamming down the road (just remember you have to wear your seat belt).
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Start out by saying I'm a big Linkin Park fan. Hybrid Theory was amazing. Reanimation was cool. Meteora good. Hell even the mash-up with Jay-Z was good. Then this. What happened? The whole idea is the combination of rap & rock, and on this CD there isn't a single song that includes both... It's like they trade off songs... Also, as if slowing and quieting all the songs down wasn't enough of a deviation from prior albums they decide they need to venture into politics and rip the President in consecutive songs... Is there really any value in a song that refers to Bush as stuttering and mumbling... he'll be out of office soon, who will want to listen back on this and think, yeah, he's right.... <br /> <br />Best song on the CD is the single, What I've Done. No surprise there. The live version of What I've Done sounds the exact same as the studio one... All in all the CD did not meet my expectations.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|what a terrible thing to do to all the lp fans...we've waited so long for a new album and this is what we get..This album is soooo slow and very tough to listen to...i would not reccomend getting this one i seriously wanted to throw this cd out the window as i was driving
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I dont mind that alot of the songs are not as heavy & that mike shinoda is not rapping on every other song. What I notice is that the guitar hooks & innovative beats arent there. On many of the songs the guitars are very boring & repetitive. Seems like it was replaced with obnoxious clapping (givin up, bleed it out, & no more sorrow which are 3 of the heaviest songs on this) & stripped down electronic beats. Then Shinoda tries to sing on In Between (tries) which is interesting but maybe should have been on Fort minors album. DJ Haun sounds like he is bored on this one as his programming & beats do not stand out as much as their other work. This album is very stripped down & the songs sound like they should be released on a B-sides album. They arent bad songs, but the problem is a whole album of them makes for a very lethargic & un-interesting release. None of the songs climax & have much energy to them. If they wanted to strip the guitars down, then more emphasis should have been put on DJ Haun. Instead, no one here is given their moment to shine. There is a guitar solo or 2 on this as well as some acoustic work & it sounds very amateur & uninspired. The strengths of LP are Chester's vocals, Chad's riffing, & DJ Haun's beats. All 3 are taking a backseat here. Im not sure what is being showcased in their place.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|This album is a good solid album with the production values we have come to expect from Linkin Park.<br /><br />The band has shown definint growth and thats a good thing. The rap has been toned down and that is a positive thing. The problem with the way the last 2 albums went (if you listen back to back) it would get overly repetitive. You either had a chorus that was either singing or rap and a verse that was either singing or rap and back and forth it would go.<br /><br />Linkin Park luckily understands that rap/rock is dead and the aweful Nu Rock/metal is deader than dead and have advanced. Their last 2 albums were very good albums and this one carries on that tradition.<br /><br />The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the unfortunate fact that they included their left wing political leanings in 2 songs. Both of which make them sound like all liberals - naive and uninformed. Other than that and the fact that both of those liberal songs still \\"sound\\" good can not be taken against them.<br /><br />Also, it is nice that they are not shying away from the occasional cuss word now and then. In the Texas concert DVD they bleeped out the cussing when they were talking and that just comes across lame. It's just a word people, can't hurt anyone. Lets get some thick skin.<br /><br />All in all it is a very good album.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Back in 2000, when I was finishing school, Linkin Park was the biggest thing since, well, Nirvana, eclipsing Limp Bizkit with their superior morals (and public image) and lack of Fred Durst. The world has moved on since then. Now Linkin Park comes back, and they have too.  <br /> <br />First listening to the disk, most people might think Linkin Park has not changed at all. The CD begins with a powerful instrumental, then jams through an equally powerful rocker akin to their old Nu days. It continues to sound somewhat familiar for some time, although the changes in style slowly start to show through. It is not until \\"Shadow of the Day\\", however, that people will start to relize just how much LP has changed. It is the first ballad-like song LP have ever made, with soft melodies behind lower voices. <br /> <br />And so, with the exception of \\"What I've Done\\", which everyone has heard, come soft songs all the way to the end. The songs all are excellent, with memorable melodies better lyrics than before. Mike Shinoda comes back and raps through on \\"Hands Held High\\", all the way to a great beat, and \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\" stands out from everything, and indeed everything this decade, with softly strummed guitars, and a slowly unfolding melody, unlike the former crunches of Meatora and Hybrid Theory.  <br /> <br />Instrumentally, the drums and guitars in the group have improved substantially. The drums, originally great, have risen to an even higher level, and the once simple guitars have improved with experience. Mike Shinoda's lack of rapping will surprise most people, but Chester's better vocals compenstate easily.  <br /> <br />All in all, this is an excellent CD, and it even comes with a MVI. Even with softer songs and little rapping, it still stands out from other albums of the age. Finally, Linkin Park have found their own sound.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I've been a Beatles fan since their Ed Sullivan Show appearances, but I've never enjoyed their music this way.  Having indulged in dance and DJ music for the last decade, I was immediately drawn into the \\"mixed\\" format of this album, with its sound bites, over plays, and mixing of seemingly unrelated songs.  At one minute I'm listening to Blackbird, and the next I'm touring down Blue Jay Way or something from Magical Mystery Tour and I'm not sure exactly how I got there.  But it's a blast all the way, and the trip is in the traveling.  George Martin and his son have brought Beatles music into the 21st Century.  All I can say is that I would love to hear more!!!
B000OCXMAE|2.0|When reading the booklet they said it took them twice as long as the first two albums. That's the problem, too much thinking went into it. Also, I was extremely surprised that it was executive produced by Rick Rubin, did he finally dropped the ball and lost his Midas touch?
1591840562|5.0|If you have any connection to starting and/or managing a business in the start-up phase, you should read this book.  Many businesses are perputally in the start-up phase because the owners have never bothered to learn the lessons contained in The Art of the Start.<br /><br />The book is well written, easy to read and contains enough humor and real life examples to keep it very interesting.  Guy Kawasaki comes from a high tech background and currently runs a high tech venture capital fund.  He is in the unique position to give first hand experience in what it takes to get a business idea off the ground, properly funded and making a difference in the world.<br /><br />Even if you have no aspirations to seek venture capital funding, there is a wealth of information applicable to all start up and early growth stage businesses.<br /><br />One great bit of advice is contained in the introduction.  \\"You could spend all your time learning and not doing.  And doing, not learning to do, is the essence of entrepreneurship.\\"  Said differently, all successful companies have a bias toward action. As Guy says, \\"No one ever achieved success by planning for gold.\\" Unfortunately this is a lesson few business owners really understand.  Planning is of no value without the doing.  Great ideas are a dime a dozen. The value is in the implementation.<br /><br />One of the real beauties and strengths of this book is the ideas are reduced to very simple, understandable and actionable concepts.  Guy discusses the necessity for a meaningful business vision - to do something that will change the world.  He labels this the start.  He then goes on to cover the vital points in positioning, pitching (selling your idea), business plans, bootstrapping, recruiting and raising capital.<br /><br />The ideas are straight forward and practical - and because they come from a backgroud of experience - you know you can rely on them.<br /><br />The book is filled with some very powerful quotes and some excellent stories which reinforce the point being made.  There are exercises to do and FQAs at the end of each chapter.  Guy also gives some excellent suggested reading list as well as reference material.  He took great pains to do a good job of indexing the book.<br /><br />There are so many great lessons in the book.  I know that I will save myself a lot of time in dealing with certain clients by simply giving them a copy of the book.  He tells it like it is and does it in an interesting way.  But in the end, there is so much truth in what he says, some business owners will simply ignore his advice - to their own peril.some excellent stories which reinforce the point being made.

0374105235|5.0|Read this book.  If you love your own children, you cannot do otherwise.  Over the years we have all heard stories written in major U.S. publications about so called \\"child soldiers\\" in far off lands being recruited into rebel armies against their will. Sad, we thought, but surely not our problem.  Ishmal Beah has written with brutal honesty about his own experience as a child soldier.  I had the opportunity of meeting him at a luncheon sponsored by the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children several days ago.  I looked into the eyes of a delightful young man and wondered how in God's name he had survived his terrifying past to go on to live a rich and rewarding life; and he has. He is not alone in his experience however.  There are other children just like him an airplane ride away at this very moment who need for you to know that they too are suffering.  Read this book. You owe it to them, and you owe it to yourself.

B000O1799U|5.0|There is no other way to describe this film.  I loved it from start to finish.  I've always enjoyed Beyonce and her beautiful voice, so for me, buying this DVD was a no brainer.   <br /> <br />Then, I popped this one in over the weekend to watch with my mother, sister and other family members, while celebrating Mother's Day and blown away by Jennifer Hudson.  She has an amazing voice, and isn't too shabby of an attress either.  Everyone enjoyed it (even the men).  My mother, who normally doesn't have much to say about a movie one way or the other, made me promise to bring it to the nursing facility she lives in, so that the other residents can see it.  Said she hasn't liked a movie this much, since Ray!! <br /> <br />I thought everyone did a wonderful job - from Jamie Foxx to Anika Noni Rose...Bravo for a job well done! <br /> <br />I higly recommemd this film....
0743289412|5.0|I have been an avid reader of Stephen King since The Shining was published but this one caught me by surprise. It was almost too scary to read - I was afraid to keep reading but I couldn't stop. This is much scarier than cell-phone zombies, or evil clowns in the sewers, or a car that wants to kill people. This is the King I like - the one that scares the pants off of you, the one that's inside people's heads.<br /><br />This is not an easy read - there really is insanity between the covers of this one. But I think it's a must-read for anyone who loves Stephen King the way I do. Not for the faint-hearted.
B000NA1OXY|1.0|I wanted to give this a \\"0\\" star. <br />I heard \\"Girlfriend\\" and thought it might be an exception, so bought the album. But the entire album is screechy, noisy and horrendous. The lyrics are trash, she is screaming at the top of her lungs and I had to force myself to listen to all the songs just ONCE. I am not going to listen to this one ever again...
B0007OCG56|2.0|I purchased this on someone's advice - to see Cloris Leachman. Turns out she had a very small part. This is a movie strictly for Adam Sandler's diehard fans. Even he's not at his best here. The writing was one cliche after another. Bored, I found myself wondering how much exercise Tea Leoni has to do to get that body.
B00005JPCF|5.0|The film is awesome! The emotions in their eyes is amazing. Music is great, sound, colors are brillant. The only problem may be that a couple of scenes are pretty intense with a leopard seal and orca's. They may frighten children under 5 or so. Other than that a fun family film!

1591841666|5.0|Seth Godin has an uncanny ability of delivering the right information at the right time on his blog, in his books, and live.<br /><br />In the late 1990s as I was struggling to understand the impact of Web marketing, he published his classic Permission Marketing. I immediately applied those ideas in my role as VP marketing at a reasonably large NASDAQ traded technology company.<br /><br />Soon after, as the Internet bubble was wearing thin and I was in a professional dip, Seth published a remarkable little essay on his blog about the benefits of quitting your job. That was exactly what I needed to hear at that moment and before long I was a scared entrepreneur starting up my own business. The first few years were great: I was building something and it was refreshing not to have to run ideas through the corporate machine. I made the decisions. But soon the little things started to bug me: buying the printer paper and dealing with mundane nonsense like Web hosting and booking airplane trips. I wasn't as engaged as when I started and business wasn't as good. I had hit another dip. But it was a different kind of dip than the one where I quit my job. This was not a dip that required quitting. Fortunately I powered through that second dip.<br /><br />In a smart and small package, Godin's The Dip lays out everything you need to understand about dips: How to identify the times that it's best to quit and move on and the ways to recognize when, if you just stick it out, you can become the best in the world.<br /><br />Powerful stuff. But Godin's work always is.<br /><br />Read The Dip. Then wait a few days and read it again. You'll appreciate the words of wisdom even more the second time.

B000OCXMAE|1.0|First off i must say is that I have been a huge linkin park fan from way back in the day.  I heard What I've done and was like ok... they always put a radio friendly single out.  Then i heard Givin Up and No more sorrow... i was like... YEAH!!!! go linkin park...so i got the CD today...and wanted to cry... so i heard the only good songs... This CD sounds like they just gave up... said \\"hey we are linkin park people will buy anything with our name on it\\"  The there is just so much emotion missing... also on anouther stand point... the last song... every little thing...  I think it was in very poor taste to have a song about the New Orlands...  its too soon...  with lyrics like  \\"all you ever wanted was someone to truly look up to you and six feet underwater i do...\\"  and having the CD cover and back cover look like its from the levees... it was very poor and with a sister that lives down there... i she ever heard that song she would loose it... i for one am one step closer to the edge and im about to call it quits with them
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I've been a loyal linkin park fan since I first heard 'Runaway' seven years ago.  Hybrid theory - awesome. It was innovative, it rocked, had sick hip hop riffs behind it, and led modern music in a new direction. Meteora - awesome as well, and it soidified their legacy as one of the great modern rock bands of this generation. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, as a true linkin park fan, I urge people to NOT buy it. Listen to it at a buddies house first, then buy it if you want. Apart from \\"What I've Done,\\" this cd sounds nothing like the old LP, and more like the postal service than anything else. Which would be fine [e.g. 'My December' - a great song], but the songs on this album don't even sound good. They tried to go soft, edgy, and deep but that isn't what there good at. Common guys, where's the distortion, where's the sick piano openings, where's the DJ??? <br /> <br />And for all you cooks who gave this album above a 3 star rating...seriously...are you kidding?
B000OCXMAE|4.0|At first glance I was kind of disappointed but as I listened to it more I see this album as pretty incredible. I see that Linkin Park hasn't lost their touch on having a unique sound. Sure its not Hybrid Theory or Meteora but I give these guys props for taking a step outside the box and releasing something that isn't like their other stuff. This album is incredible, the musical talent that this band has is off the charts. Its much more mature than their other releases and a lot softer but I still like it a lot. Just give it a chance. Don't throw it in the closet after one listen this is one that you appreciate a lot more after a few listen throughs.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Steer clear of this album if your an LP fan. Stick with the 4 previous albums, because this album is a complete waste of money. Now lets just hope their concerts are the same.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|This is NOT linkin park. This is a some other band singing another style of music with explicit and politically charged tracks. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM OR THEY WILL MAKE MORE OF THE SAME.
B0004Z33EG|4.0|I've grown up with the idea that \\"Rambo\\" is just about big explosions and violence, so when I finally got around to watching the first Rambo movie I was shocked to find that it wasn't an all-out action movie but rather a drama and commentary on the effects of war (Vietnam in particular) with action elements.  Certainly the series turns into a mindless bullet-fest with the later incarnations (not that there's anything wrong with that), but this first movie is much more than just a mindless action flick.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who likes a little action with their drama, or anyone who wonders what war can do to a person.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Wow, I was so taken away with this album.  I found the band while looking for the new Linkin Park video.  I stumbled onto the video  \\"From Yesterday\\" and was immediately hooked.   I listened to the CD about 10 times all the way through before I bothered to find out who I was listening too.   Jared Leto has an amazing voice and the metal riffs mixed with strong lyrics and an overall great sound make this the best CD find of the year.     I immediately ditched the new Linkin Park CD and went back to listening to Beautiful Lie.   I just can't get enough.   <br /> <br />From Yesterday has extreme mass appeal and is certainly the hook.  But I really love R-Evolve the best.  This song just has some of the best vocals I've heard from a mainstream band since Evanescence stumbled on the scene.   Savior is another favorite, I love the harder riffs mixed with Jared's superior vocals.   For a lighter style, this band is really appealing and easy to listen to again and again.  I'm a metal fan so I love rock that has many transitions, and 30 Seconds seems to get that.  There are several stops and starts and changes to slower beats.  The drummer also seems to like irregular beats, this adds that extra level of complexity missing in so many of today's mainstream rock bands.   I think both metal and rock fans can find something commendable with this album.   <br /> <br />Buy it immediately and listen to it a hundred times.
0743556003|5.0|This is another great writing from Mr. King.  The first story I was ever willing to spend time with was \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\".  I had always thought of his writing as things like \\"Cujo\\" and didn't need any more horror in my life.  But a girlfriend said to try \\"The Girl....\\" and I did.  From then on, I was hooked.<br /><br />\\"Lisey's Story\\" is about a woman who lost, Scott, her writer husband and about the \\"PLACE\\" he went upon occasion.  She hasn't cleaned out his study where he did his writing even though he has been gone over two years.  As she finally begins the job of doing this, two things happen.  She is being stalked and threatened by a person who wants her husband's papers and one of her sister's need to be committed.  Between these two things, Lisey has her hands full.<br /><br />In order to save her sister from becoming a permanent resident in the \\"home\\" and to save herself from the stalker, she has to face and use the \\"place\\" Scott went.  If she is not careful, the \\"place\\" may become a permanent part of her instead of saving her and her sister.<br /><br />Mr. King works the ideas of creativity, madness and love all together to write a novel that was hard to put down.  16 CD's provide a novel that is long enough to explain everything that was brought up in the novel.  There is even an afterward from the author himself where he explains where some of his phrases come from.<br /><br />The reader, Mare Winningham does a good job reading the novel.  While I didn't notice definitely different voices for each character, I was still able to tell who was speaking without losing the thread of the story.  She is a clear and easy to listen to reader.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I listen to all of the mainstream and Indie metal, hard rock and rap-metal bands and Linkin Park has been a favorite these last few years.   I hate to dis anything that a band creates, b/c I have some understanding of what goes into a piece of musical art.   Minutes to Midnight is certainly not a bad album, in fact if it wasn't Linkin Park,  I would be pleased.       However, rap-metal fans, (and Linkin Park fans in particular) have waited so long for more intermixing of the beautiful voices of Chet and Mike, that I was extremely upset when I finished listening to the whole CD.   Where were those wonderful overlapping vocals intermixed with metal riffs and rap scratchin' that were so unique to this band?  I loved the complexity of Hybrid and Metora that I found it hard to listen to any other music when they first came out.     Minutes to Midnight just doesn't do that.  Unfortunately I have to say that this is a letdown for me, I can appreciate the quality of what they put together, but the band has moved significantly away from what made them great.   It seems that all great bands have their experimental period, and I just hope Linkin Park gets passed it quickly and moves back to the rap-metal we are waiting for.     The rest of the reviews on this CD are actually quite amusing, many of the hardcore rap-metal fans rated this CD a complete letdown and rated it as low as 1-2 stars.    Several fans felt the new style was commendable and gave it 5 stars (undeserved, they are just afraid to admit it).   One fan even said that the change was about the \\"message\\".   But I would say to that fan and anyone reading, that it's not about the message, nor is about the journey that the \\"boys\\" feel they need to explore.   It's about one thing--the music silly.   At the end of the day how many times are you gonna listen to plain old vanilla music.   It's just not interesting. There are hundreds of bands playing this stuff and only one Linkin Park and now we have to wait several moreyears without great Linkin Park rap-metal.       To all you fans afraid to call Minutes to Midnight what it is, \\"usual\\", I would say you haven't been around long enough to have watched all of the great bands go through this same transformation.    Perhaps Linkin park will pick up more pop fans, I'm sure they'll appreciate all the emo-ballad songs, but to all of us metal fans, we'll just have to find other bands to fill the void this year.
0156027321|4.0|I've always seen people reading this book so I thought I'd pick it up myself and see what it's all about. I went into without any expectations and without reading any reviews. As a matter of fact, I thought the dumb animals would be have conversations about life with Pi. While reading the book, a number of people had asked me how the book was going and whether I liked it or not. My simple answer was, \\"It's popular, must be good.\\" And after finishing the book, I can say the book was good, as in fulfilling, one that gives satisfaction and pleasure.<br /><br />While the first part of the book is a straight forward history of Pi before the shipwreck, the second part of the book pulls you into a seemingly surreal setting - stuck on a ship with a tiger (the synopsis says a hyena, orangutan, zebra and tiger but most of the story revolves around Pi and the tiger). Some scenes had me at the edge of my seat and others had me dishing out sympathy. The book struck quite the chord within me (but it didn't \\"make me believe in God\\").<br /><br />The reader can read the second part in two ways: 1) read it for just how it is. It's a simple yarn about a boy stuck on a boat with a tiger. Makes for good entertainment. 2) swim through the second part in all its symbolism. Is the tiger actually a tiger, or a manifestation of Pi's stressed mind? I was trying to read the second part in both ways - taking it as is and taking it about with intellect. I recommend doing both.<br /><br />The third part is not the unraveling of the yarn, which surprised me but at the same time made for the best ending, as it's up for discussion between the readers.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I'm a Lateralus fan and it took me a while to really get into the songs on this CD.  But I have to say that \\"The Pot\\" is my favorite Tool song now.   This was a tough decision b/c I love Parabola and it's hard to quibble with that level of perfection.   But like all Tool, the only criticism is that there just isn't enough of it.   <br /> <br />I struggled with giving this CD 5 stars, b/c Tool is clearly one of the best metal bands out there, but this CD just had too many spots where I had to skip tracks while they took their time playing soft artsy stuff.   Don't get me wrong, love the art, just like the more head banging kind and when you're trying to work and listen to fast music, the soft stuff is a bit of an annoyance.   For that I give it 4.5 Stars.
B000023VR6|5.0|i have owned this CD since the year 2000,   and i still havent a heard a cd better than it or anything that come close.  this will be my all time favorite album. buy this cd. and if u dont love it, your not a true rap fan.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Megadeth's new album, United Abominations, is a great disc. I have been a Megadeth fan since 1992 and they have never disappointed me (yes, I even love Risk). On UA, Dave Mustaine and crew return to form, so to speak. The fast riffs are back, the blistering solos are even more intense, Dave's voice is in top form, and the hooks are so catchy you'll be singing the songs for days. I haven't stopped listening since I bought it, and I don't see myself stopping in the near future. Standout tracks, in my opinion, are Sleepwalker, Washington is Next, Never Walk Alone...A Call To Arms, United Abominations, and Amerikhastan, tho all of them are amazing. If you thought Megadeth was \\"back\\" with The System Has Failed, then you are in for a real treat with UA. Pick this one up for yourself and some friends, they won't be able to thank you enough. Definitely album of the year for me, and we still have 6 1/2 months left, but no one will top this! Welcome back, 'Deth!
B000J103X4|5.0|this is with out a doubt 1 of the best cds out right now. if theres anyone who  can save hip hop its probley the game. he brings back the old skool rap and keeps it real. great album dont pass this up, buy it.
0618680004|5.0|I think we all have moments in our lives where we said \\"this whole religion thing doesn't make sense,\\" it's just some of us listen to that moment and others don't.  Those of us who choose to Atheism still have questions that we wonder about, and Richard Dawkins beautifully answers, such as why is religion ubiquitous, is religion bad and how to respond to unreasonable things people say to us.  <br /> <br />
B000EHSVOG|5.0|you can't add much more flame to the fire. this dvd has seen the light. with all the extras to sweat through you will feel like you were at a hollywood bonfire. the movie speaks for itself. we all know the horror of being in a fire in a skyscraper. now more than ever. and the film doesnt play camp like other disaster films.the acting is as good as you get at the time. but it is a stuntman movie for the most part. it is amazing how well it has held up today. and the film score is one of the best for this kind of film. this a 1970's classic and it is good to have this dvd for the future generations who havent seen it.if you are a film fan you will want the story and the extras this set provides. though not the first in the genre it was the best. and an academy award winning picture to boot.
B0007XH5OY|1.0|could not get the CD to play on any player, But from owing the ablum i know the music is very good
B000OCXMAE|2.0|It's like they took everything about what made Linkin Park cool and fresh and  new and made it old and annoying.  Sappy, boring ballads, overcooked Shinoda raps, I could go on for a while on this one.  What a disappointment.  Last song is kinda cool, so 2 stars.  I could've heard Sting sing it with better results.  Go back to the formula that works (Hybrid Theory, Meteora).  How many years did I wait for this?  Humbug.  Want a true masterpiece?  NIN-Year Zero FTW.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was so inspired by this terrific show and the subsequent movie that I had to write something. Consider the following an homage to the show's philosophical core...... (warning: contains spoilers...)<br /><br />Mercy<br /><br />Mal has just knocked the huge man with the blade into the ship's engine..he pays for it later by being tortured by a man with no mercy....<br /><br />Mal decides to protect River Tam after casting her and her brother aside. She lies helpless on the ground. It is his moment to walk away. He picks her up and takes a step which will end the lives of two of his crew and yet, he finds mercy for her in that moment.<br /><br />Standing above the disabled operative, Mal turns on the recording that has finally freed River Tam and its truth stands as a final blow against the perfectionist alliance and its failed rulers. Mal takes mercy on the man and decides not to kill him while the young girl he took mercy on is saving the lives of his crew. She cuts down the reavers who are in the state they are in for no fault of their own. They are wild and crazed and innocent and receiving the mercy killing which is their only release.......<br /><br />And in the end, the mercy shown to the operative comes back and again, saves the lives of his crew........<br /><br />It is not an easy lesson, for Mercy on one has consequences for others.<br /><br />And it is never easy for Mal to know when to show Mercy.<br /><br />But he does.... Mercy to live. Mercy to die.<br /><br />Mercy to his crew to push the man begging him for mercy away from the Mule. Mercy to the same man to kill him when in the hands of the Reavers...<br /><br />Each moment while being the Captain of his crew he must choose. And that is his razor's edge.
B00005JPME|4.0|thou the film itself does not gain much from the big screen (so don't feel bad if you seeit on DVD instead of movies).<br />wahlberg carries his role well, as always, he is totally believable in the role of marine sniper trained to survive against the odds.<br />also enjoyed performance by michael pena and kate mara (accent in which she spoke alone was worth going to the movies) won't tell you about the story, cuz i never do (plus many people have done it already), but will tell you i am impressed that things that are so wrong about america (and world in general) - dishonest politicians (is there any other kind?!), connections between business, politics, money and death, the disregard of human rights, the terrible general state of affairs in the world we live in - have been depicted with so much honesty.<br />very brave.<br />that is something no filmmaker would do in my country..<br />and now to the minuses - rade serbedzija is a minus to any movie, don't know why they even hire that man. i hope he is cheap.<br />danny glover got so old he was barely able to carry his role standing up, PLUS there was an annoying mumble he spoke thru throughout the movie, like he had to speak hru a mouthful of bees (or someone else's fake teeth).<br />God, that (Glover speaking) was absolutely the WORST part of the film.
B00000F14B|5.0|This definately is a true classic.  I think it's one of the best musicals ever produced.  I love to watch it on screen or stage.  We've been to many school productions of this musical and it's nice to know there will be generations to come that will be introduced to such great music.
0307237699|5.0|Barack Obama's The Audacity of Hope is primarily a book of essays. The chapter titles show the broad scope of the work:  Values, Politics, Faith, <br />and more. There is some autobiographicall material, but it is always in illustration of the ideas being discussed.  All the the essays are thorough  and thoughtful. All points of view are carefully considered. I found \\"OUr Constitution\\" particularly helpful in its discussion of the problem of applying an 18th century document to our 21st century situation.  I usually agree with Obama's conclusions, but not always. <br />Even when I don't, I am convinced that he will continue to do his best to find acceptable solutions to such difficult problems as the best way to achieve universal health care.  His analysis of the situation confronting the American family today is particularly acute, as it details the economic factors underlying such dilemnas as whether or not the married woman with small children should work outside the home.   <br /> <br />My only major disappointment in the book was that in his chapter on Race he discusses in detail the situation of Hispanics and Blacks in the United States today but fails to give similar attention to the situation of Native Americans.  I imagine that instead of being from Illinois he was, like me, from Arizona, there would be no such ommission. <br /> <br />One cannot read this book without being conscious of the fact that the author in running for President.  Whether or not you support his candidacy, I am sure you will gain much from careful consideration of his essays.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|After listening to this album, these guys are legit.  I had high expectations after enjoying their album and I'm happy to report that they followed it up nicely. It still carries the rawness of the first album, but this time a little more touch of complexity.  I think the track \\"Only Ones Who Know\\" gives us a great taste of the Monkeys to come.<br /><br />Buy this album!
0312321376|5.0|I've learned that the more someone presses their opinion and tries to sell me something, the more I shouldn't trust that person. Jim Tucker is just the opposite. Frankly, he doesn't care whether or not you believe in reincarnation. He's not out to be the next Einstein or have his name worshiped by people for centuries to come. He's very much like Ian Stevenson; a humble guy conducting research on a very important topic; reincarnation. <br /> <br />Tucker presents some fairly convincing evidence, but that's as far as he'll go. Like Stevenson, he will not use the world \\"proof\\" and good for him, because it can't be proven. As Tucker says, this is not research one can do in a lab with tight controls in place. However, he says (and I agree) that the evidence does tend to point to reincarnation being true based on the 2,500 cases that have been amassed by Stevenson. Frankly, we know something is going on. Whether it's \\"superpsi\\" or some other psychic feat, who knows. But when a child can give several dozen names, places and be accurate on all accounts, it goes beyond coincidence. I believe in reincarnation, but I can't say for sure it exists. I do know that something paranormal is happening, whether it is tapping into the memory of another person or actually having been that person. <br /> <br />I consider Ian Stevenson to be one of the most important people of all time because of the research he has done and I'm glad to see Jim Tucker following in his footsteps.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Dare I say it? OK, I will. \\"North and South\\" is even better than \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" (Hmmm, I notice both have titles of three words connected with the word \\"and.\\") Works for me. It will work for you, too. Never mind; just get this DVD. Beautifully filmed; wonderful characters. Kind of dark; but this quality gives this film beauty. Margaret is a lovely heroine, straight and true, although, prejudiced against the North. There is sadness in this story which I think gives it a quality we all can relate to. North and South seems more human to me than Jane Austen; but the comparisons are all there for you to see.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I was waiting so eagerly for this LP album. I am a hardcore LP fan but they just let me down. What a piece of junk. Except for what I have done and Bleed it Out, none of the songs are even worth a hear. The two songs I mentioned are also okay. I am only let down by this album. I hope this is some kind of joke cause I expected a zillion times better then this. I hope they get the old Mike and Chester Rap-Rock back in the same album. Please for god-sakes.
B000M5AJQI|4.0|Adapted from the chinese movie trilogy \\"Infernal Affairs\\".  This movie is a very good piece of cinematic art.  It does not quite measure up to the orignals standards , but with with the new cast and the new writing it is worthy of 4 out of 5 stars.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|It will always be sad that Firefly had to end, but at least this film Serenity brought the fans some closure.  This film is everything a Firefly fan could ask for, except of course for more sequels...
B00008BRDX|1.0|I enjoy the music of the Police, but Amazon's shipment of my latest CDs are disappointing.  The sound is incredulously inferior and in 2 CDs, the tracks jump!  I don't think I'll ever place any order again.  I was expecting that the products I buy are in good quality but not this time.
B00004CWO8|4.0|Bourne's swan lake is an interesting twist on the traditional version. The choreography (especially for the swans) is very modern. Theatrical choreography is used throughout the show, which does have many good moments...but I can't say that I'm an overall fan of Bourne's choreography in this show. His Nuctracker is simply amazing though! When I saw Swan Lake live, I had the same feelings about it as I do about the video, but the \\"live\\" aspect at least allowed me to watch what ever I wanted to watch in the seen, and just made things more exciting all the way around.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|I wholeheartedly believe that Wilco just ended there \\"classic period\\".  Being There, Summerteeth, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and A Ghost is Born will go down in history as the four great Wilco albums.  Each one is different but equally brillant.   <br /> <br />Sky Blue Sky might just be the end of their run of four straight classic albums, but it's by no means a failure.  Since Jeff Tweedy runs Wilco like a sports franchise, there is an every revolving cast of musicians and as a result each succesive album is fairly different than the next.  Sky Blue Sky is a much calmer, more restrained and more straighforward effort than anything that they have ever produced.  Gone are the chaotic guitar squalls and violent imagery from A Ghost is Born.  In it's place are straightforward tunes that are far less bleak and chaotic, but just as musically accomplished.   <br /> <br />One way to describe a Wilco album is by what artists it sounds like.  Sky Blue Sky definitely has a 70's MOR vibe to it.  It's reminiscent of The Eagles or Steely Dan.  Tweedy's songwriting is in the vein of John Lennon, he uses simple images but they remain powerful images.   <br /> <br />So I won't call this a classic album it's still a very good album.  I've been a Wilco fan for a long time and i'm used to Tweedy throwing the listener a curve ball.  If your expecting expermental and chaotic songs, then your in for a surprise.  But who knows, I didn't really like A Ghost is Born until almost a year after it's release, so maybe this album will grow on me enough that i'll consider it alongside their other classic albums.
032147404X|5.0|I love this book. It explains clearly how to shoot pictures <br />in a prompt manner. I am learning so much. It is the best I have ever owned.
B00005OWIU|5.0|We love the music from this composer (John Williams - also composed Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Superman) to begin with and wanted this soundtrack.  It doesn't disappoint.  My children are so excited about the upcoming HP movie that we play this soundtrack on the way to school each morning.
0143038419|5.0|I would recommend this book if you are a reflective person thinking about what it all means.  I think it would resonate with you - you may find a new way of looking at life, religion, spirituality and discover organized bulding-based religion isn't the only answer.  I loved the discussion about heaven and hell and had just recently come to the same conclusion as the author.  If you are someone who sees this book on the bestseller list and isn't someone that finds themselves on a spiritual journey constantly mulling things over and making decisions for themselves, then I'm not sure how much you will enjoy this book.  Perhaps it will become the beginning of your search - perhaps you won't finish the book.  I wish I had started my journey of questioning and evaluating and reflecting and finding my own way earlier - like the author started in her 30's I didn't start until my late 40's.  Maybe this will give you a jumpstart - wonderful book - life affirming, possibly life changing.  Thank you - Liz Gilbert.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I can understand how people might think this is Linkin Park's \\"evolution\\" or \\"maturity\\", but to be flat out honest, it sounds like they just went with what the mainstream rock currently is and presented us with this their take on it. Obviously you don't want to do the exact same thing you did before cause it gets old, ie. look at Korn, but they have taken it a whole other level with Minutes to Midnight (which even sounds like an emo cd title, except its 3-4 words shorter). <br /> <br />If you're a listener from way back when Hybrid Theory came out and that's what you like the most, you're probably not going to enjoy this one too much. I agree with what others said about Chester's voice on this, I didn't even think it was him singing at several points. Maybe he's losing his voice from all the old songs and getting tired of screaming at the concerts. <br /> <br />The absence of Mr. Hahn and Mike Shinoda also really hinders this CD. Alot of the unique style that they created with their last cds is gone which is also why people aren't taking a liking to it.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|At first glance I didnt think this show was going to be any good, however, one night due to boredom, I gave it a chance. I'm glad I did. I got hooked after watching just one show. Luckily I have a cable network that saves past shows so I was capable of going back and starting the series from the start. I watched the whole season all the way through.  <br /> <br />Now about the show. What I like about it is that it provides you with a glance into a serial killers mind and how they develope into killers and how they see the world. Literally every part of Dexter's life is filled with manipulation due to the fact he hasnt developed the ability to truely bond to others... a true sociopath. Everything from dating, family relationships and interactions with co-workers is done to superficially fit-in to society and to fulfill his urge to kill. For example, Dexter has a girlfriend not because for his need to love but instead to be accepted as normal and acceptable. This idea of fitting into society and not sticking out is a primary theme his foster father taught him growing up. <br /> <br />Another thing I like about the show is that it constantly inserts childhood flashbacks explaining things about Dexter's development. I work with emotionally disturbed children for a living and many of the behaviors and experiences Dexter displays, the children I work with do also. This exploration into a serial killers life and mind is VERY fascinating to me. I believe a lot of what's true about Dexter is also true of the every day sociopath.  <br /> <br />As for an example of what I am talking about in regards to these flashbacks explaining Dexter's development, during one of the very first scenes, Dexter, as a child, is talking with his foster father, who is a cop, about multiple neighbors animals going missing. Dester, looking around 11 at the time, explains to his foster father that he sometimes gets urges to kill and uses neigborhood animals to relieve his urges. He then goes on to explain that he sometimes gets urges to kill people also, however, he doesnt because he doesnt want to let down his foster father. (This bond with his father is rather odd to me though. True sociopaths dont bond to any one. The show kind of explains why he bonded with his foster father and no one else later in the show though. His foster father was the first person to rescue him from the tramatic experience he went through.) Throughout the season, flashbacks occur such as this that definitely adds to the storyline. I usually dont like flashback type shows, however, this one was done VERY well. Another interesting thing about Dexter is that over time you learn to like him and root for him due to the fact he only kills the evil... other serial killers and killers. His foster father the cop trained him to relieve his urges that way as he got older. This show was VERY interesting all the way through. Take my word for it and you'll be another person I got hooked on to this show. As my title states, I've gotten everyone else I know hooked, now I'm starting on people like you I dont know. Give it chance you wont be sorry. <br />
B000MR9D5E|2.0|THIS VERSION MIGHT NOT WORK IN HD WITH SOME 1080i UPSCALING DVD PLAYERS!!! <br />I bought this version and popped in into my Sony DVP-NS75H DVD player and almost cried because the quality was horrible compared to watching it on HDTV cable! I called Sony and they said it was a formatting issue with the DVD. Just to check, I bought the $80 Discovery Channel version, which isn't as good, and it works great with my HD Upscaling DVD player! <br /> <br />BTW this is the best documentary EVER!!! <br /> <br />Just don't buy this BBC version if you have a Sony DVP-NS75H player!!!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I was thrilled with this item! I loved it and watch it regularly! It arrived in perfect condition and a lot faster than I expected it to! I was thrilled and would recommend it to anyone!!!
0374105235|4.0|I really loved this book.  It was very informative to read about what was going on in Sierra Leone in the early 90's.  This book had some graphic parts, but they really help you feel what the author felt going through this experience.  I was a little disappointed that the end wasnt stronger, and it left a few ends untied, but overall I would recommend this book to everyone.
B000000I0H|5.0|If you're reading this, I will assume that you fall into one of two listener categories: either you already are familiar with Mike Oldfield's music and are wondering (if you don't already own it) whether this album is worth buying or, you simply are looking to expand your musical listening options by trying somethng different.  For those familiar with Mike Oldfield, I will state up front that this review is not directed at you: you already have your opinions as to which Mike Oldfield albums are best, and those among you who have submitted reviews have very clearly articulated why you like or dislike this particular album.   <br /> <br />     That being said, I offer the following:  If you enjoy \\"experimental\\" instrumental music that I would compare to Jean Michel Jarre, Tangerine Dream (earlier years), Vangelis, Jean Luc Ponty and perhaps some of the music generated by the ambient music group Aphex Twin, then I think you would truly want to add this album to your collection. I listen to music at least 10 hours/day at my office, and consider Incantations to be among the most enjoyable and listenable music among the 1000+ CD's I own.  <br /> <br />     Because of my overall love of music, I admit that I do not care about artist \\"integrity\\"; whether this album measures up to Mike Oldfield's prior output; or whether the music is as technically or intellectually challenging/ground breaking as some of his earlier works. In my opinion, Mike Oldfield's music is brilliant.  For me to go on a limb and write a review, however, the bottom line is whether the music can be enjoyed and appreciated each time you hear it.  Incantations is such an album: the sound quality is superior; the instrumentation is mind-blowing; and the overall excellence of the music compelled me to seek out and buy more of Mike Oldfield's music.  I believe that if you already have a taste for this type of music, Incantations is a \\"must have\\" album (Ommadawn, Tubular Bells I and II and Songs of DistantEarth are among Oldfield's other albums to consider). The sound is captivating, and the fact that the album provides over 1 hour of music (uncommon for Oldfield)is a welcome bonus.
B000NDIAWY|4.0|The sound on this album is most certainly \\"stripped down\\", lacking the bombastic quality that Brandi's voice is famous for. I like the album because I love Brandi Carlile's style, but I don't think her powerful essence is captured here. I admire the attempt to make the music more marketable to a broader demographic, but I don't think they pulled it off in a way that satisfies the band's steadfast fan base. What peaved me most was a minor lyrical change in the song Turpentine. Remember when there were \\"no freaks allowed\\" and it meant something to us pariahs?
B000MV8AE0|4.0|He's one of those rare actors that can't be pigeonholed into a role or type.  For a while there, Ed Harris simply was Beethoven and we were watching him slowly wind down his life til he went out in a blazing hymn.   <br /> <br />I wouldn't buy this film to watch over and over unless I was a very strong classical music fan, but \\"Copying Beethoven\\" was well worth watching at least once.
B00005JLCI|5.0|IT'S ABOUT TIME!!! What is taking so long for studios to release these rarer movies (also the recently released 'The Butcher Boy') on DVD? From one format- VHS, to HD-DVD now coming into it's own, these films have passed the initial decade of the DVD. That's ridiculous. It's not a 1930's print that needs years of cleaning. Get them out faster!

0735619670|3.0|I feel that this book has some holes in it.  In some areas where I do have some understanding of the topic, McConnell I believe misses the mark.  As an example, let me contrast CC2E's advice on speeding up your programs with with advice provided by by Alex Martelli (Martelli is \\"Uber Technical Lead\\" at Google).  In Martelli's excellent book Python in a Nutshell, when discussing optimization, Martelli focuses almost exclusively on a dicussion of the big-0 (how an algorithm is proportional to N; log N, N, N log N, N squared, etc).  He goes on for pages in detail about the topic and says \\"do yourself a favor and watch out for the big-O: all other performance issues, in comparison are almost always insignificant.\\"  The book \\"The Pragmatic Programmer\\" also dissusses O(N) issues quite a bit as well.  In Code Complete 2nd edition, there is no discussion of the big-O at all that I can find, or any mention of algorithms being proportional to some function of N.  I cannot find it even mentioned.  This is an incredible oversight.  If CC2E is missing something that important, then I'm suspicious of what else it is missing.

B000OCXMAE|2.0|Linkin Park wanted a new sound on their latest disc.  Unfortunately, it seems as though the guys have spent too much time lately listening to Porcupine Tree records.  Seeing as Porcupine Tree is a great band, I'm sure it made for some wonderful and uplifting listening experiences.  However, Linkin Park apparently took their listening pleasure one step farther.  They wanted to make a Porcupine Tree record of their own.  The result is MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT.    <br /> <br />The problem is, Linkin Park simply cannot hope to match the musicianship, sonic beauty and diversity, or lyrical depth and intensity of Porcupine Tree.  As a result, MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT comes off as a record made by a band who wants so badly to be the band they've worshiped since they were kids that they will likely never find a sound of their own.   <br /> <br />You expect something like that to happen with a local band destined to go nowhere, but it's unfortunate when it happens to a long established artist like Linkin Park.  One has to wonder if this is a band which has stopped believing in itself and its own strengths.  Linkin Park is an excellent modern metal band.  Next time around they'd do well to remember that fact. <br /> <br />For better listening in this genre, check out: <br />* Porcupine Tree- [[ASIN:B00006IU73 In Absentia]] <br />* Porcupine Tree- [[ASIN:B0007XT87G Deadwing]] <br />* Porcupine Tree- [[ASIN:B000O75F7C Fear of a Blank Planet]] <br />* Blackfield- [[ASIN:B000F8NKK4 Blackfield]] <br /> <br />

The first chapter grabbed me and I found it hard to put this book down.  Cassandra Clare has done a great job developing the organization called the Shadow hunters, who hunt and kill demons.  The chemistry between Clary and Jace is intense.  I couldn't help but want to follow both of these characters as they looked for Clary's mother.   <br />This book has something for everyone--tension, suspense, and even a twist at the end.  A must read for any urban fantasy fan.   <br />I dare you to read City of Bones and not get swept away. <br />
074356619X|4.0|It is good advise.  Set the user to use a certain mind set and moves the user into a self aware on how the person is the process of their thinking, which draws real world issues to the user, good, bad, or whatever.
0805047905|5.0|There's a reason why this is a Classic... it's a book that any child will love. We started reading it when my son was less than a year old, and it's still one of his favorites now that he's almost 3. The pictures are in vivid color and the rhyme is simple. His favorite page is the last one, where he likes to point around at all the animals and see how fast I can name them for him. We also like to flip through the pages and make the sound of each animal, instead of just reading the story. The board book version means even the littlest hands won't harm the pages, so it will be in our home library for years.

B000O75F7C|4.0|This is a good album. I still prefer the last two over this one but understand that this is the one doing the best in sales and on the charts so more power to 'em. <br />Porcupine tree is still one of the best bands out there. Definatly worth a listen. <br />Would love to see them tour with Marillion.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|real fans of linkin park will really love this record, fans that only like linkin park because of their heavey sound wont like this record at all. <br /> <br /> <br />you see there has always been more to linkin park that the average listener hasnt been able to understand about them, but the real fans do understand. linkin park were never ever about just making heavey music, they were always about making hybrid music. they use to mix nu-metal with hip-hop and electronica and during meteora did the same thing but also mixed it with piano and orcestra music. on this record they mix in all kinda of diffrent generes including alternative, rock, hip-hop, ska, punk, electronica, and even others. they are still doing what they have always been doing, just with new styles this time. alot of people dont see that, and the people that do not see that arent real linkin park fans. odds are you got into them because they were heavey or they had lyrics you could relate to, or maybe other reasons and i understand why that would attract you...me on the other hand, i got into them because they were always able to be creative with their music, and this record totally shows how creative they can really get. <br /> <br />alot of you are not thinking about this either. hybrid theory and meteora are very similar records. meteora experimented with orcestra and piano and some calmer sounds but still were able to make them into rock out songs (minus breaking the habit). would you really want part three of that? the two and half minutes to three and a half minutes, intro, verese, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, end formula? dont you think that it would get old after awhile? honestly, bands like linkin park can just keep doing the same thing over and over again, because you'll never know what else they can do. they tried something different, but at the same time did what they always have done. it's just something you have to try to accept. can you honestly say you'd want another record that sounds like hybrid theory? because waiting four years for part three of something we've already heard just doesnt seem to be worth the wait...at least not to me. something new and different was what i was personally looking for, and thats what happened. <br /> <br />i'll even admit though, at first i wasnt too into this record the first listen or even the second...but like some people have said, just listen to it a bunch of times and see what the record really is. throw out the idea that you want nu-metal sounding linkin park and just check out what else these guys can do. ever since i got it (two days ago) i've been listening to this record almost none stop. roughly 40 times since i got it, and i still cant get enough of it and think the only downfalls of this record are its kinda short and could use a little mike and joe. other then that this record...to me...is flawless. <br /> <br />I think the best part about this record is the lyrics. Old and New fans know linkin park write great lyrics, and this time around they have written their best lyrics to date. alot of people call this record emo as well...but i hate to break this to you, but alot of the songs on this record are political songs, and last time i checked, politics and emotions were two totally different things. and also, no more sorrow?... come on guys, get real, this isnt emo. and if there is one thing this record has in common with its older records, its that the lyrics are still amazing.  <br /> <br /> <br />just look past the sound change, open your mind, and take it for what it is. a hybrid, new work of art.  <br /> <br />thanks for reading.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|First, I want to say that I am a dedicated Linkin Park fan and have listened to their stuff obsessively. I did the preorder and I listened to the CD three times through before I would even discuss my opinion with anyone else. So I did give Minutes to Midnight a thorough listen.  <br />I gave this album 3 stars mostly because I'm pretty much on the fence.  <br /> <br />Musically, the album was good--it was nice to listen to, good rhythms, creative, nice vocals, etc.  <br />Lyrically, the album was pretty good, although I don't think anything on M2M,  except perhaps What I've Done, can compare lyrically to their old stuff.  <br /> <br />As a standalone album, Minutes to Midnight is excellent--as a Linkin Park album, not so much. I always found LP to have a pretty distinctive sound, but on this album I was heavily reminded of various other bands. Hands Held High actually sounded more like it belonged on a Fort Minor album; good song, but not Linkin Park. I know that LP was looking to change things up with this album; I respect and admire their decision to do so. It was great to see what other talents  these guys have. I think they did a good job.  <br /> <br />But if you are looking for nothing more than a continuation of what came before, M2M is not for you. This could either be a good or a bad thing.  <br />Nobody wants a carbon copy of the same stuff, but I felt like something was missing. LP to me was always something you more \\"felt\\" than listened to; there was a lot of emotion in it. Didn't really get a lot of emotion out of this album. Again, you can look at that as maturing or no; it's a personal preference thing.  <br /> <br />Overall I would recommend this album--just be aware that this is nothing like what you've heard from LP so far. What I've Done is the closest to oldschool LP, and even that is pretty different...and if you've listened to it as a single, you'll find that it sounds completely different within the context of the entire album. Definitely, ifyou're going to listen to Minutes to Midnight, make sure you have the right tracks and in the right order, because you really need to listen within the context of the whole album.  <br /> <br />
B000O178BY|5.0|This is a very good album by nine inch nails. I highly recommend anyone to get it.
1586210661|5.0|Hearing David Sedaris sing television jingle lyrics in the voice of Billy Holiday is priceless, and sheer satirical genius. Sedaris' fourth book of short stories will once again make you laugh out loud with glee.  Many of the stories center around the theme of \\"speech\\".  Sedaris swears off the letter S as a child tortured by his Southern speech therapist.  He struggles with the inability to speak as an adult when he moves to France and attends language school.  His self deprecating humor is a delight and Sedaris continues to find humor and poignancy amidst his quirky family and the banal moments of life.  If you have never heard Sedaris read his own writing than you are missing a whole other dimension to his humor.  Check out the audiobook, you won't be disappointed!
B000P12LWY|5.0|I started watching this show and loved it. I have always been facinated with the Tudors and this gives an indepth and realistic account. I'm not sure how detailed it is because it tends to fast forward through time to keep the plot going, but I didn't mind. I wanted to see more of the story.

B000OCXMAE|1.0|I am reminded of the south park episode of faith+1, and also of listening to nickleback or some other pop-rock band all at the same time. Gone is the angry, angst-filled music of the old linkin park. Instead we have songs about how he was alone on valentines day and that made him sad. This change was not a welcome one, and anyone who loved the first two albums should NOT buy this album.
B000N6U0E2|3.0|If you have a student you're trying to inspire to apply him/herself, this is a good inspirational rags-to-riches story showing that you can overcome adversity to beat out people with more advantages.   <br /> <br />Smith and his real-life son are likeable characters and you'll root for them to succeed. <br /> <br />But if you're just looking for an evening's entertainment, the story badly bogs down in the middle.  I would've edited it by 15-20 minutes. <br /> <br />As another reviewer noted, it was good once, but it is not one that's going on my shelf to be watched again because of that bog-down.
B0000C7PQK|3.0|This is a three year old review that I wrote on a different account which is now deleted.  Hope its useful!<br /><br />Enigma is undeniably the most successful name in New Age. Undeniably. I do own all six of Michael Cretu's cds (including the greatest hits) and both DVDs. Romanian-born Michael Cretu has a visionary talent in creating the dreamiest, most beautiful sound waves of our time.<br /><br />His first four cds were part of what he called \\"Phase One,\\" spanning from the year of his first album's release in 1990 to his fourth in 1999 (I believe that is when it was released). With \\"Voyageur,\\" he commences \\"Phase Two,\\" and it REALLY shows that this is VERY unlike his pervious masterpieces.<br /><br />To all Enigma fans who have not yet heard the sounds of Voyageur, let me tell you that you will find very different style of music. No longer will you find \\"Sadeness\\" or \\"I Love You, I'll Kill You\\" or \\"Return to Innocence\\". Have you ever heard the trashy sounding EuroPop? Well, in an interview Curly M.C. admitted that he was \\"going for a more pop-like sound.\\" He wasn't lying. If you like fever-inducing Pop/Trance/Techno beats then you might find something you like here. I'm a down to earth kind of guy and I am not trying to bash Curly M.C., but listen to me - listen to the songs on this album before you buy it. Its not that its bad, its just very different from his pervious works.<br /><br />Let me close by saying that I have searched far and wide and Enigma-esque music. The closest I found is Pilgrimage and a couple of Delerium's albums are kind of like it - but nothing still tops Enigma.
1400079179|3.0|This was an entertaining book for certain. It was a page turner that kept me up late a couple times and I enjoyed reading it. However, the book is not as clever as it thinks it is. I found that the puzzles in the book were easy to solve, for everyone except the characters. In a couple instances I knew the solution to the current problem facing our heroes several pages before they figured it out. And I am not the kind of person who solves the mystery before the movie ends if you know what I mean. This would probably be a nice read for a young teenager.
B00003XB8K|5.0|This is a review I wrote almost three years to the day on a different amazon account that I am deleting, and I just wanted to put in my two cents.<br /><br />Being the fourth album from the legendary musical mastermind Michael Cretu, it was also at the time the most different (now his fifth album voyageur stands out as the most individual). I consider this album and Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi to be his (Michael Cretu) best album. The amazon editorial review said it all. Of the two questions posed at the end of her review, i must say that Enigma's music is a beautiful union between artificial and indigenous sound. This album is beautiful. Tracks that stand out the most are \\"Between Mind and Heart\\" \\"Modern Crusaders\\" \\"Gravity of Love\\" and the second track, which i forgot the name of. Buy this album!
B000NA2776|5.0|This guy's voice is amazing!  If you miss the days when male singers  were really singers and not some pop-image being marketed to 12 year-olds, you will really enjoy Life In Cartoon motion.  The last decade of Pop music, especially here in the states, has been so uninventive, predictable, and dull --particularly in the male vocalist genere. I had forgotten what it was like to hear an album free of over-sung boy-bandish sappy ballads and/or whiny 'unplugged' misery-songs.   Mika's Life in Cartoon Motion is a welcome breath of fresh air and I would venture to say he one of the best all-around artists to come along in a very VERY long time.  If you loved Prince, George Michael, Freddy Mercury, Elton John, or Michael Jackson when they were at the top of their game you will really appreciate this guy's voice and song-writing.  Mika's range is remarkable and his ability to sing with a flamboyant-abandon but still be in control is nothing short of fabulous!  It is easily one of the best albums I have bought in the last five years.
B00005OMTT|5.0|I wrote this three and a half years ago as a 15 year old on a different amazon profile that i am deleting.  here is my two cents.  I didn't realize then since I was a very naive boy, but the acronym for the title of this album is (and not accidently) LSD.  Yes, this album is sonic Lysergic Acid.  Or THC, you pick.<br /><br />Spirituality enhancing music has never been as entrancing and alluring in the history of music. Never have I been so at one and felt so at home with music as I have been with this lush comilation of Enigma's Phase One (first four albums) greatest hits. Almost all of Michael Cretu's music should be on this cd because his music is so inspiring...it takes you on a mind altering journey through sound from which you may wish never to return, simply because of its fresh, pure musical taste.<br /><br />Many of the tracks that made it on this cd are there because they were on the top of the charts. Not all of them are necesarily his absolute best...I wish songs like \\"Between Mind and Heart\\" and \\"Callas Went Away\\" were here, but the exclusion of those songs doesn't deteriorate the value. Even if Curly M.C. wanted to put more tracks on his Greatest Hits, he would have had to opt for a second disc because....theres already 74 minutes of pure heaven on the single disc. Anyway, explaining M.C.'s unique vision of music is next to impossible to explain; the songs are a mix of rhythmic beats, breathy vocals, synthed orchestration, and mystical lyrics, which are refrences to the Bible in some parts. Sampling the music is the only way to discover the beauty. Languages include Latin, French, and English. The quality of the synthesized sounds sound like they could have been made yesterday, which is an example of the talent and effort put into every Enigma cd.<br /><br />Now I may sound like a paid advertiser for Enigma, but I am in reality a very down to earth guy. So I tell it like it is. This review is no exeption. The samples so kindly provided by Amazon above are not the best...M.C. likes to launch each of his cds with slow orchestrations, and then he picks up the pace with the third track. Really, only allowing thirty seconds of sampling doesn't quite do the cd justice. To become absorbed into a piece, you have to listen to the whole thing.<br /><br />please, dont illegally download music if you do....it hurts the artist from which you are stealing.re not the best...M.C. likes to launch each of his cds with slow orchestrations, and then he picks up the pace with the third track.

B00003XAQ5|4.0|\\"Kind of Blue\\" is one of the all-time great jazz recordings so I was eager to get this on SACD. My other Super Audio discs absolutely blew me away so I was expecting this recording to do the same. Not only was the SACD sound far richer than found in regular CDs but the spacing of the musicians was so pronounced as to make it seem like you were in the studio or club listening to the performance. Alas, I did not get that same experience with this recording. The only discernable difference between this disc and its lesser-priced cousin is a marked fullness. If you want to upgrade your jazz library, there are far worthier products in which to invest your money.

B000NIVJEU|4.0|Okay I will say straight up that I have never read the books so my view of the movie has not been tainted with the knowledge of how good they were and how the movie followed them or not.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie, to me it was a cross between LOTR and Narnia. Definitely not on the same budget as those two movies but you get the idea. Lots of CGI used but it was done pretty well I thought.<br /><br />The video transfer is top notch and the audio transfer is also pretty darn good. I would place it as a Tier 1 Blu-Ray quality movie.
0767805712|5.0|I seldom watch a movie more than once.  I've already seen this one twice and am buying it so I can watch it more.  It is currently plausible enough to be scary due to gene mapping and manipulation.  It shows the effect of classing people by genes on those considered lower class (limiting them even though passion can cause someone to rise above their limits) and the effect on the higher class (depression from not meeting high expectations).  It's a strong look at how we view ourselves and others.  This movie really reached my heart and keeps me thinking about it for weeks.

1400049628|5.0|This book is really funny. It is written is a very factual way which makes the reader forget you are reading a product of the writers well developed imagination. Contrary to popular belief, a flamethrower is not the ideal weapon for dealing with the undead!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I'll admit - hearing \\"What I've Done\\" on the radio, I was not blown away.  I was a huge fan of both Hybrid Theory and Reanimation, and liked Meteora alright (though felt it was not as innovative or talent-requiring) <br /> <br />However, my sister pre-ordered this album, so I sat down on launch day and listened through the whole thing, start to end.  From the second Wake's faux-record sound began to the end of the final bonus track, I was entranced. I loved the way Wake channelled the same vibe as the intro to Reanimation.  The Rock (with a capital R) just picked up from there. Given Up and Leave Out All The Rest are single-worthy rock songs, and Bleed It Out is the most Linkin Park-y song on the album. <br /> <br />Shadow of the Day and What I've Done slow the album down and add a bit of an emo touch.  I don't mean that in a negative way, however - the songs do not feel disingenuous or like they lack authenticity. <br /> <br />To me, Hands Held High is a musical triumph in and of itself.  The song aptly and adeptly conveys a frustration with the domestic class war which is being waged alongside the war in Iraq.  Poetically, Shinoda's rap flows from fallacy to fallacy and laments the situation without beating anyone over the head or resorting to sheer anger to communicate.  As someone with a number of friends in Iraq, this song really hit home with me. Beautifully done - reminds me a lot of the vibe of \\"The Good Soldier\\", track 4 off NIN's Year Zero. <br /> <br />No More Sorrow is another strong rock song.  The 6/8 tempo is a first for LP, if I'm not mistaken.  In any case, this song's voicing combined with the march-style snare drum heavily connotes \\"Scottish Rock\\" to me.  If only an electric bagpipe were a reasonable request... ;-) <br /> <br />Valentine's Day... Ahh, the only song on this record which I would rate under 50%, and OH how I loathe it.  From a musical standpoint, it's actually decently complex and intriguing... and then the chorus lyrics come in, andthis song becomes worse than garbage.  It's trite, and reeks of selling out.  I just fear that this will be a single off this record and will be played alongside Panic! At The Disco songs ad nauseum.  Good thing I don't listen to radio anymore... <br /> <br />In Between and In Pieces are also solid tracks.  I enjoyed the use of synth in In Between to mimic the electric-cello type sound they got in Kr4wlng on Reanimation.  On this song, both the harmonies and Chester's vocals evoke Death Cab for Cutie; unusual for LP, certainly, but thoroughly commendable, as Death Cab is greatly gifted with musical talent.  In Pieces returns the end of the record to a more driving, speedy tempo, with innovative harmonies which defy typical rock conventions blended with Chester's trademark rasp.  This is glorious for me, being both a lifetime musician and an LP fan since I first heard \\"One Step Closer\\" on the radio... <br /> <br />Finally, The Little Things Give You Away just, well... blew me away.  About halfway through the song, I remembered that I was, in fact, in a room listening to music.  Up to that point, it totally enveloped my conscious mind. Linkin Park uses a chorus?!?  Really? Since when?  It was amazing, IMO - a mark of a truely mature band, being able to pull off a song like this, a beautiful song so different from what they became famous.  The song starts out slow with just a perc track, acoustic guitar, and vocal.  It builds for verse two with electric guitar doubling the acoustic's chords, then picks up another harmony line of electric halfway through.  By the time it hits the second chorus, the song starts hitting hard with great drums, and it then flows into this... crazy, psychadelic, bridge section at the same tempo but with a completely different feel to it.  This song would be AMAZING to see live - I have no doubt they would improv the middle section for a good 3-4 minutes. <br /> <br />Also, if you pre-ordered via itunes, there were two bonus tracks.  One wasjust a live \\"What I've Done\\" - nothing fantastic there, except to know that yes, Chester does actually sound like that.  However, the second bonus track, \\"No Roads Left\\", I would highly reccommend - I don't know how you can obtain a copy if you didn't do the itunes pre-order, but I'm sure it will eventually be available somehow. <br /> <br />Anyway, sorry to be longwinded.  I wanted to be thorough and detailed about what I liked, since a lot of people have been giving a lot of negative reviews. I hope this helps you, and please - give this record a chance. No, it's not Meteora - if you want to listen to Meteora, go buy a copy of it, and put it on repeat. :P  But it *is* solid music, and it *is* still rap/metal fusion that Linkin Park brought to the mainstream world. I was prepared for them to fall far short of my expectations - having been gone for so long, I wanted something really amazing from them to show for their time gone.  However, I let myself be hooked and get taken away.  Listen to the album from start to end, and run with it! :D

B000OCXMAE|5.0|I wonder if anyone who rated this album Really listened to it, or owns it... I think it's sad attacking a group just because they don't sound the same as before. Would you seriously want a band to sound the same all the time? I've respected them as artists since I first heard \\"Crawling\\" on the radio. They worked hard on this album, spent numerous months (14 total) on it, and we repay them by bashing them? Listen to the MUSIC, it is different but change is good especially in this album. If and when you buy this album, I highly recommend reading the exerpt in the booklet. It explains pretty much everything, and it was a very inspiring read. Please add this to your LP collection, you will not be sorry. Oh and by the way they mention in that little exerpt that this is an unfinished album, but they wanted to get it out there for us, and i'm so glad they did. I hope that means there will be a Minutes to Midnight part 2. This album is a bit more politically inclined than the rest(Listen to it and read the lyrics and you will see what I mean.) Thank you for your time. Also, as one of the other reviewers had previously mentioned, LP TOLD us numerous times they took out the Nu Metal sound, and that this album would be different. Apparently no one paid much attention to that. They reserve the right to explore and push their talents to a new level, and i'm glad they did ;).
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I love that all the \\"old school\\" LP fans claim that Rick Rubin came in and ruined the LP sound.  Wake up and realize that the band needed to change their style.  Why else do bands go to the \\"Song Dr.\\" himself, Rick Rubin?  Red Hot Chili Peppers, Johnny Cash, Dixie Chicks, Tom Petty.  And when they went to Rubin, their albums sounded better than anything they had done.  Linkin Park is the same way.  This album has a couple tracks that aren't wonderful, but what is now a days?  I love the stripped down sound of the album, and I love the fact that they took something they hadn't done a whole lot of, and really ran with it.  I bet these songs are gonna sound great live too.   Don't judge LP based on the fact that they're trying to be \\"innovative\\" in the rap/rock industry anymore.  That era kinda died when Limp Bizkit went limp (no pun intended).  Do yourself a favor... buy the album, don't steal it.  Enjoy it.  And really listen to it with an open mind, and hear it for what it is.   That's my 2 cents.

B00005JPFH|3.0|Spider man 3 could have been really good but sadly it was not. With the great fight sequences and fantastic cinematography,it had all of the nuts and bolts. Here are some of the flaws. The plot was so mixed up and crazy who could keep up with it? Nothing was explained ,where did the meteor come from ,I know space but,come on some kinda explanation was needed. What was the biomass made out of? Even if they had said it was made out of some kinda dark matter molecular energy it would have given some credability to the story. This film is also guilty of a major sequel no no. Changing the story line to fit the movies plot. With the sandman's charecter being incorporated into the story line back in the first film. Not to mention this movie is needlessly too long . Thirty minutes could have easily been cut off. Kirstin for the sake of Kirstin,c'mon I'd would have rather seen spidey hook up with the landlords daughter ,who at least seems like a real person. The \\"I'm to sexy bad boy sequence\\" was really corny and way too long. Overall the action was great but the jumbled mess of a plot and too many villians,who were all just misguided good people gone down the wrong path,Isn't there anyone who is just truely evil? Could have been great but sadly it is what it is.

It gripped from the start and there were enough twists and turns and double crossing along the way to keep me guessing and reading along.<br /><br />What I also really enjoyed in this book this time was the moral and ethical morass that Reacher dwells in outside his campaigning for the true and right causes he follows. In the past Reacher has been a builder and has alluded to other odd jobs, or made money from his work. In this he has taken to ripping off drug dealers. There is no moral reasoning either from Child (the author) or Reacher the character, like pretty much everything he does, Reacher is the strong silent type. Reacher simply rips them off. I was interested in this as a sub-plot. He is essentially stealing - I suppose in a Robin Hood way, but it does endanger the general public to do so. It is certainly a fitting form of income for Reacher, but it is done with such seeming casualness or internal dilemma I was surprised.<br /><br />Anyway, I enjoyed this way more than most of the others (except perhaps One Shot which I think is the best REacher ever.) A gripping, thrilling page turner to match any that you will read.acher, but it is done with such seeming casualness or internal dilemma I was surprised. <br /> <br />Anyway, I enjoyed this way more than most of the others (except perhaps One Shot which I think is the best REacher ever.)

B000OCXMAE|2.0|Like others, I am a huge Linkin Park fan.  However, I must say this album is at BEST two stars.  Those that rate this four and five stars are simply crazy.  There are maybe 3 or 4 good songs, none great.  Way too many ballads, not enough edge and where's Mike? <br /> <br />Uggghhh.....

This Mission Impossible movie set shows you why the Panavision cameras and lenses used to film movies cost over a quarter million dollars each and the Kodak film used in them cost well over a thousand dollars a roll. The blu-ray [[ASIN:B000JG2N2I Panasonic DMP-BD10 - Blu-Ray disc player - upscaling]] images from this player I bought from Amazon are simply stunning! And this is a top notch action movie set.
032147404X|5.0|this book is true to it's description, it's tips on how to make your pictures look less amateur. nothing more, nothing less. Just tips, such as what lens to use, filter, tripod etc. a lot of things amateurs don't implement when taking point and shoot pictures.  <br /> <br />at first i wanted to give this book only 3 stars, but i re-read the description and thought that it would be unfair to the author to deduct stars because the book IS true to it's description, I was just expecting more out of it. when i bought the book i thought it would be more on teaching photography. it's not, it's just tips. I still have to buy a different book to understand digital photography better and to understand the Exposure Triangle = aperture, shutter speed, exposure  <br /> <br />Plus, i think i'm in love with Scott, so i couldn't give him less then 5 stars ;D
B0001KZM3O|1.0|This was the worst album the floyd ever made. In his egomania Waters had a stipulation that included the proviso on the original album: music by Roger<br /><br />Waters, played by Pink Floyd. Wow! If it hadn't been for Gilmour, the Floyd would have died after Barrett left this galaxy. This album is concerned primarily with Roger's obsession about his father's death in WWII.<br /><br />No one actually blamed him for this, it is an earth shaking trauma. But Water's infinite whining and bitterness just kept getting harder to endure.<br /><br />I had been following Pink Floyd since their first tour in the U.S. I saw them in concert first at an abandoned tire factory in Philadelphia back in the early 70's or late 60's, and then every subsequent concert they played in the U.S. Water's basically just started to go crazy around animals, and in this album he became unendurable. This was the last album before the breakup and thank God, Gilmour, Wright and Mason<br /><br />endured in the lawsuit Roger brought on to dissolve the Band. BTW, the album the Band released after the breakup became their biggest selling album. This album is hard to take, even for a Pink Floyd fanatic.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Everyone should see this movie.  I especially liked the part about the discrepancy between scientific articles disputing global warming versus popular / mainstream articles disputing global warming.  It will give you a new perspective on what the 'critics' are basing their arguments on.
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|I heard \\"Winter\\" from this album and was hooked: though I'm not really a fan of Zach Braff's acting/movies, the man has incredible taste in music (as the Garden State soundtrack proves). Part of me is glad Joshua Radin isn't yet commercialized, but notice I write, \\"yet.\\"  Seeing the huge similarities between Radin and, say, the Shins, John Mayer or Iron and Wine I'm just waiting for the day for when Radin is played outside of JC Penny commercials.  <br /> <br />Anyone who likes some soft accoustic and wistful vocals should at least listen to the sample songs on Amazon. \\"Sundrenched World\\" is another beautiful song with haunting cello lines and gorgeous chords. Even some of his lighter songs like \\"Photographs\\" are far from fluff-- any artist who can also write lyrics about Simone DeBeauvoir or Sylvia Plath is just awesome.
B00009RAYR|5.0|The Spanish label \\"Definitive Records\\" collected 233 songs, including all the studio material recorded between 1933 and 1942 for Columbia. All the alternates are included (at the end of every cd: good choice) and there are some great live sessions. The 10 cd box is very cheap and has a nice design. There's a 100 pages booklet with all the lyrics, the liner notes and a short essay about the issue. The 24-bit remasterization, in my opinion, cleaned the sound and made the instruments more \\"present\\", even if a background noise is recognizable in many songs. I think the result is remarkable, and I suggest this box not only to Billie Holiday's fans but also to all music lovers.
B000OCXFCO|1.0|I am a huge Megadeth fan (own every album but the first one and Risk), who picked this up upon release. I must say I am very dissapointed. I can't believe that 32 of the 33 reviews posted to date have been positive ! Well time to add a rare negative review... <br /> <br />WIthout going into details, this is the worst album Megadeth have ever put out. It seems like it is just being \\"heavy' for heavy's sake, with the songwriting and melody tossed out the window.  Also, the ranting/political stuff is annyoing. It's almost like Dave isn't even singing, he's ranting over the tired riffs. <br /> <br />whatever happened to the epic songs, amazingly heavy (yet melodic) riffs, and expert songwriting? Seems like it's all gone. <br /> <br />I would reccomend any Megadeth except this one if you are looking to find something worthwhile from them. <br /> <br />Or, better yet, discover a band still in the \\"hungry\\" stage of their career trajectory (Becoming the Archetype comes to mind) <br />
B000006TRV|5.0|This music represents the insanity in all of us  we are no different than Pink Floyd.As fans of Pink Floyd we share the same genetic genious of these incredible Musicians,however our role is only to consume this music...Being genuine fans of this music clearly indicates that we are all crazy and can be very proud to be a member of this elite club of lunatics.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|First of all, I love Linkin Park.  I think they are one of the greatest bands of their era.  They've even redefined the way a rock band can sound.  But when I first bought this cd and I listened to it for the first time, I was a little shocked at how different this work is then Hybrid Theory or Meteora.  At first, I wasn't really sure if I liked it all that much.  A lot of the songs are very soft and melodic, much more then their previous works.  After listening to Minutes to Midnight for the third time all the way through, I am in love with this album.  Yes, it is a much different Linkin Park, but maybe even a better one.  You can tell when a band becomes more mature and broadens their horizon.  If they had the same sound in every album they made, it would eventually become old and stale.  Minutes to Midnight assures that that won't be the case with Linkin Park.  For all the critics of this album out there, before you become too judgemental about Minutes to Midnight, listen to the whole thing through a few times.  You may not like it then, but many people like me will simply fall in love with the beauty and well thought music put into this album.  Here's to Linkin Park for making us realize that limits should always be tested, and you can come out of it for the better.
B000O174CM|5.0|[[ASIN:B000O174CM Dreamgirls (Two-Disc Showstopper Edition)]] <br /> <br />Dazzling production values and a perfect movie re-creation of a landmark Broaway show.  It doesn't answer the question of whether Beyonce is more than just beautiful but it does show why Diana Ross was a super star (since they exactly copied her photos and album covers and choreography and style).  The extras on the second DVD are not that thrilling except for expanded full versions of several songs.  These make it well worth buying the 2-disc showstopper edition.  Highly enjoyable even if you have seen the movie one or many times.
B000055Y0X|4.0|Dr. Strangelove is a kick to watch if the style suits you. Littered with black humor and satire dated to the early cold war days, this movie will provide as much comedy as it will history.  <br /> <br />Do not expect the flashy humor in todays comedies but a more subtle poke at the dark aspects of society and humanity. <br /> <br />The only problem I had with any aspect of the purchase was a small crack in the clear protective plastic which protects the cover. <br /> <br />A good buy for movie know-it-alls and aficionados.
B0000062Y2|5.0|This was very exciting to listen to - i love the orchestration added in the background....... now i need the words also - great cd - speedy delivery!
B00008977N|4.0|This one dates back a few, but it showcases a really cool stage in the round and a concert experience different than most concerts out there.  \\"In Your Eyes\\" is great and Paula Cole joins in on stage.  Cool dancing, great sound.  Fun to watch.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|ive been looking forward to this album for sooooo long and i consider myself a hardcore LP fan....its just sad that they choose to disappoint all of their fans like this.  If linkin park needed to change or \\"mature\\" they wouldnt have sold 40 million records to date with their \\"immature\\" sound.   whatever....music is music and it all appeals to different tastes and genres....in this albums defense i can truly say that SOMEONE out there will like it but to all fans who liked linkin park for their truly unique sound....you will most likely not like it or like it but not love it.  It was like going to see a movie that you've been awaiting for months and  it being a complete flop! I and I'm sure many other linkin park fans feel a bit betrayed that they went astray from the \\"roots\\" that got them where they are today...but hey whatever..maybe someone else will come along...maybe they will own up to their mistake and write another awesome record...all i can say is i wont go and buy it without question next time.  I will most def preview it before i spend even $5 towards any of their records. <br /> <br />TOTAL CRAP
B000OCXFCO|4.0|If I've learned anything from reading reviews on Amazon it's this: there are too many \\"BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR\\" and \\"WORST ALBUM THEY'VE EVER PUT OUT\\" reviews. My opinion is to skip over these reviews immediately and try to find someone who's putting some thought into this. I have an extremely hard time giving ANY album 5 stars, to me nobody is perfect and a review that good should be reserved for the truly classic albums, which this has not yet proven itself to be. <br /> <br />To say this is the metal album of the year is bold, we still have another six months left and there are some really good bands with releases slated for this year (Iced Earth is one that comes to mind). It is just as bold, though, as to say this is their worst album made...I mean \\"Risk\\" is still on the shelves. Seriously, I liked Metallica's \\"St. Anger\\" better than \\"Risk\\". However, since releasing \\"Risk\\", the last three Megadeth albums have in fact gotten better. \\"The World Needs a Hero\\" was definately better and then \\"The System Has Failed\\" was a step up from \\"Hero\\" as a pretty solid effort. \\"Abominations\\" continues that trend in my mind. The style is definately old-school Megadeth from the musical arrangements to the production. It does not have the overproduced sound many \\"bigger\\" bands start to get after they've been around forever and yet it isn't so gritty that everything sounds like mud. Dave Mustaine is a marginal lyricist at best and that hasn't changed much here. There are more than a few cheesy lyrics surrounded by some truly thought provoking ones but if that hasn't bothered you before, then it isn't going to now. My biggest problem with the album as a whole is \\"A Tout Le Monde\\". I was never a huge fan of this song to begin with and to me saying it's the \\"greatest metal ballad ever\\" is a huge statement, especially when comparing it to Killswitch Engage's \\"End of Heartache\\"; THAT was a powerful metal ballad...if you want to hear such things. I actually think this version is better than the original because of the way Dave and Cristines' voices mix together. It's almost haunting the way they work. My problem with it is not the song itself though, it's more the fact that it's on this album. It just doesn't fit in with the rest of the songs here. Everything else is almost twice as fast and a little bit more complex. I would almost compare it to if Metallica released \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" on \\"Master of Puppets\\"...it just wouldn't flow right. Maybe if this was a hidden track or something it would work better, I just think it disrupts the flow of the album as it is. <br /> <br />Anyway, to sum things up; I think that if you are already a Megadeth fan, you'll be happy with this release...maybe even a little surprised. Dave has been making music for over 20 years and this is pretty much your standard Megadeth thouroughfare. There's not much here to get overly excited about nor is there anything to warrant getting too upset. On the other hand, if you're new to Megadeth, maybe you should look at a greatest hits collection first. <br /> <br />Just my opinion...
B000NDJOO2|3.0|First, let me state this will be a very short review. The standard things by which we judge a film are cinematography, acting and story. The first is artful and beautiful. The second is also well done. The third is the shakiest bit but it is generally true to the history so I can't really make a judgement other than on what they decided to portray or not portray. <br /> <br />We don't often comment on or review a movie for it's message these days. The message of this film is that there are no heroes. It is repeated often. The problem with this message is it is false. The film even disproves it to be honest. Iwo Jima was an island crawling with heroes. The statement about the battle is that \\"uncommon valor was a common virtue\\" denotes the fact that more Medal of Honors were given at this battle than any other in the war. The sacrifice needed was great and met by the brave people that were there. <br /> <br />The Pacific War was a horrible war. The Japanese found themselves at the end of the colonial era without colonies. They originally had good intentions, I belive, with their ideals of a East Asian Co-Prosperity union. As it turned out, various factions destroyed any chance of that and what became of it was a brutal, murderous rampage through the Pacific. That had to be stopped. <br /> <br />So on that island were tens of thousands of Americans who knew this and knew that this was a very important battle that could not be lost. Not all of the heroes died on that island. <br /> <br />As for the 3 flag raisers - the country needed the money to finish the war and not conceed defeat to the Japanese. Apparently they were successful in their bond drive mission. Thus they were heroes, directly responsible for the success we had at the end of the war. <br /> <br />The film is worth watching and certainly worth discussing its philosophy and presentation. Many thanks to those who made this film. I enjoyed watching it. <br /> <br />
B000E6G4Y6|2.0|Metamorphosis: AKA \\"Klien's Revenge, came out at the time a \\"greatest hits\\" thing, \\"Made In The Shade\\" was released.  That's all that needs to be said.  And I am SO OVER you idiotic dead zeplin fans just going gooey every time J Page is mentioned. So @#$%ing what, he was merely a session guitarist when the track with him on it was originally released.  BTW, I purchased MY copy of Metamorphosis from a purveyor in/from Russia, and it has 6 \\"bonus\\" tracks on it (which, in truth, are about as el-stinko as the rest of album itself), but it has the infamous \\"And Mr. Spector & Mr. Pitney Came Too.\\"  Yeah: THAT one... Anyway, DO get this CD, if for nothing more than \\"I Don't Know Why\\" and \\"Family.\\" BTW, I DO have a conscience:  this AIN'T worth 39 bucks, and you can get \\"I Don't Know Why\\" on that ABKCO/Stones' singles thing.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|The Arctic Monkeys not only surpass their fantastic debut, but they make it sound effortless. If any doubt remained, this stunning album blows it away. These guys are the real deal.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|My nephew was recently being picked on and we decided to put him and his cousins in Karate classes for self-defense. Soon after, Wal-Mart ran an ad with The Karate Kid DVD in it. Perfect! I loved it as a kid and now the children in the family fell in love with it.  <br />The Karate teacher even uses parts from the movie to make his point about something and the class knows what he means. The movie teaches that Karate is for defense and that it's bad to use it to pick on others. This is definitely a movie worth the purchase.
0380729407|2.0|I will get directly to the point, which is something the author found difficult to do in this book.  <br /> <br />This is one of the most disjointed, incomprehensible novels I have ever tried to read. I think this book is the most clear case of an author's vanity that I have ever seen. Do you ever get the feeling (when you're reading a novel) that the author is so very proud of the colorful language he has just scattered across the page that he can scarcely help himself from trying to top his last success at articulation? That is the way this book reads, like a perfect example of an author's vanity getting away from him.  <br />I grew up with this movie (and loved it!). This is one instance where I can honestly say that the movie was way better than the book. The book took too long to get anywhere, tried to introduce motives for characters' actions that never seemed to make any sense (to any normal person anyway), and was generally boring. <br />So, whatever you do, stay clear of this book. Jump, skip, skidattle-crack your way on down the road to another book (yes this is my attempt to imitate Bradbury's annoying descriptive style in this book). You will not find anything that you liked about Farenheit 451 (another book by this author) in here.
B00005JNS0|5.0|My whole family loved this movie. It was entertaining enough for adults and still fun enough for kids. My favorite part of the show was the voice of Larry, the cable guy. My only upset was that they put at least one bad word in it. I know kids hear cussing all the time now, but they don't need to hear it in cartoons. It just makes it more acceptable for them to repeat. <br />
B000HEVZ8K|4.0|The picture quality is amazing for a film of its age.  A very well done HD-DVD release.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|If the last three studio albums comprised a story, I'd say that Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was the build-up; A Ghost is Born was the climax and Sky Blue Sky is the resolution - that's how they sound anyway.
B000NA28I4|2.0|This movie is based on the first book of a three-series trilogy inspired by the LOTR movies.  I have not read any of the books, and will only comment on the movie as a stand-alone piece of work.  The strongest impression I had of this movie is the amatuerish feel of everything, including the dialogue, acting, action scenes, story line, and soundtrack.      First, the dialogue was simple and boring, full of short sentences and seemed to be ripoffs from other movies.  For example, there is a scene when an evil sorcerer named Durza leads an army of grotesque humanoid creatures into battle.  From the setting of the scene, to the way it was shot, seemed like a total copy of the scene in LOTR: Two Towers when Saruman sends his Uruk-Hai army of to battle.      Second, the acting was horrible.  From the death scene of Brom, to King Galbatorix's musings on his throne, most of the serious scenes looked fake.  One good example is after Eragon finds his uncle dead.  Brom tries to take him away and Eragon resists with angry words but weak actions.  Brom easily puts him on a horse and leads him away.  It seems Eragon knew the entire time he had to leave, but was just trying to throw a tantrum.  A more realistic version would be to have Eragon resist Brom violently, and the latter having to knock out the former with a good punch in the face.      Third, the action scenes were very disappointing.  This is most apparent at the end when Galbatorix's army invades the land of the Varden.  The ensuing swordfights looked totally staged, and there were several times when two swords are supposed to clash, but no sound is heard.      Fourth, the story line was full of holes.  The entire battle scene seems to belong to the bad guys, but somehow the good guys end up victorious by the movie's end.  How did this happen?  Also, who teaches the dragon Saphira how to breathe fire.  One moment she blows hot air; then after one night with the Varden she can blow streams of fire.    The soundtrack was also a big disappointment.  I heard one tune repeated over and over again for all the action scenes.  The rest of the movie the soundtrack was unnoticeable.  Of all the recent fantasy movies so far; LOTR, Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia and this, this movie has the worst soundtrack.    Overall, a bad viewing experience.  It was not the worst movie of 2006, but for the hype it received, it was the biggest disappointment.  Unfortunately, the ending scene promises that a sequel is in the works.
0613028155|4.0|This is a wonderful story that draws you into it just like it did Bastian. It's a must read for adults as well as children. I was looking for the same printing of the book I had found in a local library in the 1980's which was larger and printed in different color inks. Even though this edition of the book is like a hardbound paperback, the story is just as good.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Great buy!!Like walking back in time...This will bring back memories for lots of people..
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Great movie for everyone to see. This showcases the raw emotion and complications people who are strapped for money face. There are millions of people around the world, even in the States that face this everyday. No one should have to sleep on the floor of a subway bathroom, especially with his son beside him. Kudos to Will Smith for doing something this bold!
0743238257|2.0|This book is easy to read and provides the authors insight into a few of his clients and how they grew personally and spiritually from a psychodynamic viewpoint.  Perhaps what I didn't like was that it rambles far too much and sometimes I found myself getting lost as what the whole point of the story was all about.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|It doesn't surprise me that people who are so unreceptive to change would miss such an amazing message.  This is probably the most significant American protest album to be released in 30 years.  The whole thing is a scathing indictment of American foreign policy and specifically of George W. Bush. <br /> <br />Buy this album for \\"Hands Held High\\" and \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\".  These two songs are talent and message in their highest form. <br />
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I originally purchased the CD version, but this didn't have all of the songs that were sung in the concert.  I purchased the DVD to get the whole concert experience and am not disappointed with the music or video.  These 6 women are very talented and entertaining.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|BUT, after playing the cd from beginning to end I was very happy with Linkin Park's new album. I've heard a large number of the LP faithful are upset; I don't know why. I guess the problem is that people don't realize artists grow and change; don't compare this to Hybrid Theory because that album came out 7 years ago. That doesn't sound like a lot of time but I was 13 when that came out. At age 20, I'm a different person and so are Linkin Park, for the better. And quite frankly, this album trumps so many rock acts out now in terms of depth, variety, writing and (not counting debut acts) growth.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|After watching the PBS special, I liked the music, so wanted to purchase the CD.  The only thing I was disappointed in was that not all of the songs from the concert are in the CD.  Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the CD.
B000068FY0|5.0|This isn't Supertramp's first album although it was the first that most people heard. What might surprise people was that Supertramp started off as a prog band. Their first album had four members and no horns. Their original guitar player Rick Palmer would quit over the band's musical direction and end up as King Crimson's lyricist from Larks Tongues thru Red. Their first album Supertramp wasn't even available in the US until 1976. This is their third album and finds the band headed in a different direction and doing quite well at it. This was a monster hit album and ended up making the band one of the most popular band's of the '70's. To try and pick out any song would be tough as the whole album recieved a lot of airplay back in 1974 and 1975 and 1976...well, you get the idea. I have to admit I don't listen to it that often but when I do, I enjoy it.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|This is a great movie. it's most likely my favorite. it is not exactly like the book but the director did a great job adapting the text into the film. it is definitely a must have if you are a fan of japanese movies.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|You know the premise - he's a serial killer who's also a police forensic pathologist.  Dexter Morgan grew up the adopted son of Miami's most honest cop (James Remar, playing against type as Dexter's sympathetic paterfamilias).  For reasons revealed at the end of the season, Dexter has a killer compulsion, with a peculiar fixation on bloodlust.  Unable to control his impulse, Dexter's father decides that it doesn't have to be used for evil.  Though sworn to uphold the law, Harry Morgan knows that the law can't be any more perfect than the imperfect specimens of humanity who run it.  As an adult forced to make-do with memories of his beloved adopted father, Dexter now moonlights as a hunter of murderers who have beaten the system.  In the first few minutes, he dispatches the choir leader of an exclusive private school - but not before reacquainting the victim with the corpses of the choir-leader's own murderous lust.  (Unlike other killers, Dexter only returns to the scene of other people's crimes.)  The running gag is that Dexter's double life isn't genuine duality after all: Dex's professional specialty in blood-spatter analysis is an outgrowth of his peculiar fixation with blood (in serial killer fashion, Dexter saves souvenirs of his kills - blood drops on slides) while he uses his detective skills to locate his victims. <br /> <br />At first it's hard to see Michael C. Hall's Dexter as something other than a darker version of \\"6 Feet Under\\" David Fisher, seeing that they both work with stiffs.  However, Hall soon makes the character suitably distinct from Fisher, or just about any other you'll see on TV (even pay-cable; Imagine Tony Soprano giving up \\"The Badding Bing\\", waste-management or hijacking trucks - everything but having people whacked, personally).  The stories make sure to keep Dexter's victims suitably reprehensible (other serial killers, rape-murderers, repeat drunk-drivers, immigrant smugglers, suitably repugnant white-males, etc.) while keeping Dexter from becoming too sympathetic.  Instead making him likeable, \\"Dexter\\" makes him compelling.  It couldn't have been easy, but \\"Dexter\\" pulls it off.  Dexter doesn't try to excuse or justify his kills as much as get us to understand his artistry.  Dex manages to avoid the whole \\"moral equivalence\\" question entirely, even pointing out his awareness of his peculiar compulsions.  He knows that there's something wrong with him, the way he relates to others, or fails to.   <br /> <br />Dexter's bloodlust is a mixture of compulsion but also piety (he's the bad guy who goes after other bad guys), but we soon sense that the mix isn't quite even, and the first episode presents Dexter with the greatest threat to his self-perceptions, and perhaps his life - a serial killer who manages to outwit not only the entire Police Department of Miami, but Dexter himself.  Soon dubbed \\"The Ice-Truck Killer\\", he leaves a trail of desiccated, dismembered corpses across Miami - and he can't be caught.  Making his victims look like chopped-up life-sized Barbie dolls.  \\"No blood\\", Dexter muses in horror - not at \\"Ice Truck's\\" grisly methods, but at his artistry.  Blood is the very underpinning of Dexter's dark existence - Michelangelo has met Jackson Pollock.  As Dexter digs into the new killer, it's soon clear that \\"Ice Truck\\" has begun digging back, and he knows Dexter's secret as well.  As Dexter's admiration for the killer grows, we begin to wonder how far \\"Ice Truck\\" can go using Dexter's fascination against him. <br /> <br />It's a fascinating plot idea, and luckily, it's enough to keep the series going.  Unfortunately, that's all the series has going for it, surrounding Dexter with largely one-note characters who develop little beyond their first impression.  The vindictive Sergeant Dokes has it out for Dexter by the time he first appears, and well before he begins to wonder about Dexter's special affinity for serial killers.  When Dokes proves capable of going outside \\"of the book\\"when it suits him, and trouncing anybody else in the process.  Angel, a more sympathetic detective, soon proves to be a sad-sack with a history of marital problems.  Dex's superiors, the up-and-coming Lt. Laguerta, and a PD captain who looks patterned after Darryl Gates only round out the cast without fleshing out the population.  The mystery itself is little mystery - the story just drops clues in serial fashion so soon before Dexter can find them, and not giving us much of a head start to realize how thin a mystery we've got.  That said, Dexter is enough of a character to carry the series, raising a rather intriguing question: are superheroes just serial killers with superpowers instead of chainsaws and chloroform?
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I thought that Rush did a great job putting this CD together, it's like they've got a bit of their grove back. I have no regrets buying this CD and adding it to every CD they ever put out collection.  <br /> <br />James B.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This CD is a must have for anyone who sometimes needs to raise a fist in the air and bang your head.  My favorite from Tool thus far.
B000N3SRRC|5.0|Another great album from Clutch. More of a blues feel than the last albums, but very good. Some very strong tracks. \\"You Can't Stop Progress\\", \\"The Devil & Me\\", \\"Electric Worry\\", \\" When Vegans Attack\\" and \\"Opposum Minister\\" are some of my favorites. I would highly recommend picking this one up. You won't be dissappointed.
B000MGUZM0|3.0|\\"Boys Don't Cry\\", according to Robert Smith.  Well Mr. Smith you are a liar.  Boys and girls both get teary-eyed sometimes.  Now before everyone flips out about my 3 star rating, here me out.  3 stars is still more favorable than negative.  If everyone rated all the albums they liked 5 stars, then how could you compare the truly great albums to the fairly  good ones?  The answer is still subjective.  Mind you all reviews are subjective, so bear with me.    The Arcade Fire are definitely one of the more rewarding modern bands.  In a struggle of desperation for the music of today, I could not dismiss this band after an amazing debut release.  Neon Bible is definitely not as wonderful as Funeral, but still holds up well on its own.  The biggest surprise is that the lead singer's voice has slightly improved.  Win Butler does not a have a great voice but his fragile wail is sweet and sincere.  I can definitely hear Robert Smith in his voice.  Unfortunately, the arrangements are lacking and the lyrics are far less interesting.  The songs are clumsy, yet playful.  Dark undertones simultaneously blend with moments of tranquility.  It's hard to find a song that touches you in all the right places with so many things going on here.      \\"Keep the Car Running\\" is a  Cure-like single with a bouncy riff.  \\"Black Mirror\\" and \\"Neon Bible\\" are a little too uneventful for my taste.  Some of the most innocent and ornate moments occur when the moaning and orchestrations take over.  Such is evident in the second half of \\"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations\\" and \\"Ocean of Noise\\".  Some other highlights include \\"No Cars Go\\" and \\"My Body Is A Cage\\".     Some of these songs are actually really good, but too many inconsistencies are present.  This is a sloppy album that I think can be forgiven.  Even though I was disappointed overall, i'll still be in line for the next release.      Messy review? Exactly! Now you know how I feel.
B000002GBK|5.0|This is the first album of Rick Wakeman's I ever heard. I fell in love at once. It has both the English sense of destiny and the modern (yes, still) sense of continuity. You get a sense of the Legend through the songs, and a new look at the love story behind some of it. <br /> <br />From this album I fell in love with the man's work.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Its been about 3 years since Linkin Park has released a new album and i was a little concered because it has been so long but i listened to the whole cd from beginning to end and its soooooooo good!! The sound is really different but thats what makes this cd soooo good!! I would recommend anyone who is a fan to get this cd ASAP!!!!!
B000O75F7C|5.0|Another work of sheer beauty and power. The focus is on dynamics within songs, and the production is mind-blowing and modern. Steve Wilson is a musical genius as a player, yet has all the studio savvy to go along with that. Guitar playing, keyboards, and pianos are all loud and rocking, and the album has been produced with high levels of atmosphere thrown in like huge gobs of sonic candy. Vocals are excellent, and the bass player and drummer really keep things extra tight. Heavy and beautiful. The 17 minute track is a true centerpiece and is almost worth the price of the album alone. But its all amazing, and all a very large step above the norm and the mundane.
B000N6TX22|4.0|Great movie, some playback issues with the Toshiba HD-A2, not sure if it was the HD-DVD itself or the player. Kinda short at only 1 hour 50 minute long
0061120073|5.0|I know it's horrible, but I JUST read this and I can't believe it took me this long.  Lately I've been laying off the real reads and sticking to mags, blogs, and thrillers...with a few nonfiction pieces thrown in for good measure.  I picked this up because it's the only mass market I own (someone gave it to me) and I was headed on a trip. <br /> <br />I couldn't figure out why, but I couldn't put this book down.  There's no big suspense, no mysteries to figure out, no major plot twists (or big plot, for that matter), but I couldn't stop reading it.   <br /> <br />This book reminded me what reading used to mean to me before I let myself get so caught up in reading current events and career-related stuff.  This book is about hope.  The characters are amazing and you grow to love them all.  Then you keep the turning the pages because you can't bear to give up hope that everything will come out all right.  This book is a lesson to all, without offering up any blatant fable-type morals.  Please read it...and just enjoy.
B000O75F7C|5.0|As an old PT fan, I am never sure what surprises lie in store with the next vision from Steve's cranium; it is FEAR!  And again I am pleased.  It is a rather bleak, typically darkly beautiful, but honest assesment of our \\"overly-entertained\\" and electronically anesthetized society.  You will not be sorry to enter Mr. Wilson's inner domain.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I highly recommend this product to anyone out there. The fooatge and images of this series are images you havent seen before it is just amazing. For the people with x-box 360 it works just fine, you just have to download an up-grade for the HD DVD ENJOYYYY.  <br />Thank you BBC for giving us such a great tittle.
B000002KK2|4.0|It's hard to believe Ricki Lee Jones was only 23 when she recorded this album (according to the Amazon review). I suppose I was in a similar space when I was that age, slumming. But I never wrote a song this good (I checked the ASCAP database, and yes, she did write it). This guitar-driven, Doppler-effected, blues inflected, spoken-word dejected hymn to the American highway is flat-out brilliant. Here's  how it ends:<br /><br />\\"But this one ain't fuel-injected<br /><br />Her plugs disconnected<br /><br />She gets scared and she stalls<br /><br />She just needs a man, that's all<br /><br />It's her last chance<br /><br />Her timing's all wrong<br /><br />Her last chance<br /><br />She can't idle this long<br /><br />Her last chance<br /><br />Turn her over and go<br /><br />Pullin' out of the last chance Texaco<br /><br />The last chance\\"
B000OCXMAE|4.0|After being a fan since near the beginnning, buying all their cds (even the not so good remixes, and going to see them on the family values tour, I was patiently waiting the last 3-4 years for an album.  With that much time in between it should be d!@n good.  It was better than I thought, even though the only local cd store rips you off for $17 when you can buy it here for $10.  I dont like #5, 9, and 10, the mellow ballad type songs even though I did love my december. I watched them on SNL last week and wasn't impressed, especially with bleed it out. It was too repeatative. Shinoda was pretty absent.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is a movie made from a series that didn't last a whole season. However, I don't know what fool decided to cancel the series. It could have gone on and on like Star Trek. The actors are really talented and I can't wait to see them in other things. Nathan Fillion, in particular, is so expressive and easy on the eyes as well. You really need to see the series before viewing this movie. The movie stands alone but it's not a great movie. After you are invested in the characters from watching the series, you will become much more involved with the movie. A warning to people who love the series, this movie has a sad ending.
0805047905|5.0|This picture book has a multitude of identifiable images that is<br /><br />appropriate to readers.  Children will love the text and repitition of words which will keep them engaged. The overall theme of this book relates to colors and animals.  This is shown within the illustrations, which are bright. The colors that are used within the story help to create a sense of high-energy not only among the images seen, but by the readers as well.  Overall, this is a great book to have.  It will keep children engaged, as well as wanting to read it more and more.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series has a serious cult following and after watching it, I can see why. It's truly a shame that there isn't more of it. You will definitely want more after you see it. Joss Whedon is a genius. Nathan Fillion is a hottie. I was tempted to watch this when it was on T.V. but I'm not much of a T.V. watcher. Later a friend lent me her copy and I was hooked. I will watch this over and over. It's funny, sweet, exciting, fanciful, believable . . . The captain and crew of the Firefly class space ship, Serenity, take off on adventures at the edge of the Universe. It's like Star Trek, only for ordinary people. It seems very real. It's how space will really be when we get out there.
B000P6R6X8|5.0|I have only listened to the album fully through 3 times. Jeff Tweedy is the best singer /songwriter /musician in the music business today. This album impresses from the first note to the beautiful On And On And On. Great guitar work throughout, one of my favorite drummers in the business adds flourishes that are almost orchestral at times. The live songs on the DVD are outstanding and the package is complete. Best Band in US since The Band.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|After 4 years Linkin Park finally comes back tgether as a full group to release a 12 track 11 songs album.  Though it is not a classic like \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\", it still is worthy of 4 stars.  I have around 850 cd's, 90% are rap cd's but Linkin Park's last albums are probably in the top 5%.  Like another reviewer said, it has a lot more slower ballad-like songs and less harder upbeat songs that they do so well.  They said it took over 2 times longer than usual for them to complete the album and they recorded over 2 times as many songs as their last 2 albums but it still only has 12 tracks and teh quality of the songs is good, but not GREAT like they usually do.  Of the 11 sogns on here, 1 is almost a classic, 4 are ok, and the other 7 are good, only 1 or 2 being real good.  Don't get me wrong, I like the album and it's a good album, but not a classic like their previous 2.    #1 - (short instrumental)  #2 - 7.5  #3 - 8 (slower song)  #4 - 8 (upbeat track)  #5 - 7.5  #6 - 8  #7 - 9.5 (my favorite on here)  #8 - 9 (nice upbeat fight music)  #9 - 9  #10 - 8  #11 - 7.5  #12 - 6.5 (slower song about Hurricane Katrina)    check all my reviews
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This album has a great mix of old and new. All you lames need to diversify your taste and learn that the same LP would have gotten boring and jaded.
B00008A7QK|5.0|This album captured a defining moment in rock and musical history, and made 1971 all the more 'cosmic', as well as honestly creating a genre imitated by many other bands whether consciously or unconsciously. It remains a sad reminder to his loyal fans of what a wonderful gift of music this man contributed to the world. His music is like a warm fragrant summer breeze that makes you happy to be alive.....and also reminds you how frail and precious life can be. It is his first venture into a 'full' rock band and rock album, yet still retains the spiritual feel and lyrical content of his previous albums, to a degree. It probably is his best album from a critic's and the average listening public's point of view; Commercially his best album in the States, while scoring a top ten hit with 'Bang A Gong'. 'Cosmic Dancer' is a revelation, 'Bang A Gong' is his signature song and a terrific rocker that is subtle and explosive at the same time, 'Jeepster' is Marc Bolan doing 50's rock and roll with fuzz and is so cool!'Planet Queen' could have been a huge hit I'm sure...'Life's A Gas' has such a classic hook and a winner as well as sad too...'Monolith' is so 'pre' 'Dark Side Of The Moon' sounding, and actually is as good as anything on that album (Floyd is awesome though).'Girl' reminds me of John Lennon, and even more of a style Bowie would take on, and is a beautiful song.'Rip Off' is like something off from a Stones album from that time period, yet all Bolan!'The Motivator' is a catchy song with a good driving force, 'Mambo Sun' is the great opener and mood setter for the album,'Lean Woman Blues' is a great \\"happy\\" blues song, and almost a live, written on the spot kind of song!<br />To sum it up, get this album- it's classic and takes you to another plane of consciousness if you let it!
032147404X|4.0|The book was very good but covered to many biginner examples.
B0000029PC|5.0|These definitive recordings show an unusually warm George Szell--not the cold hearted tyrant of legend--working out with the astonishingly polished Cleveland Orchestra. And for once the remastered Columbia/Sony sonics are deep and full and without high end distortion, faithfully reproducing the silky string sound of Severance Hall. These are essential recordings that confirmed Schumann's place as a major symphonist.
1582701709|1.0|This CD goes against everything that the BIBLE teaches us. <br />I would encourage everyone to read their BIBLE and less \\"Secret\\".
0975991477|5.0|Brilliant, empowering...merge of science and spirituality...Bruce's energy and his passion radiates in his work!  A must read for every indiviudual to understand one's relationship with one's cells ! and that we are all powerful to make any changes we want-Namaste, Bruce!
1582701709|4.0|This book is inspiring.  While it's message is not altogether 'new' to the way we live our lives, it teaches us how to think positively in a unique way... by living 'the secret' through 'the power of attraction.'  It is not a typical chapter book that one buzzes through on a lunch break. Conversely, it is one to savour and be read in increments in order to let the message sink in. Try it out and share it with others.
1582701709|5.0|Excellent, The Secret is the best book I have ever read (besides the Bible).  I wish the whole world would read and apply The Secret.  I am reading it for the 4th time, it has changed my life.
B000O174CM|5.0|Dreamgirls in my opinon is by far the best and most amazing movie i have ever seen in my life. Probabbly because I like the whole musical thing. Bill Condon, who directed the film did a tremendous job. The lighting and the scenes with the dancing were incredible to watch. It was like we were at an actual Brodway show. Casting wise I will get into next.  <br /> <br />The cast on the other hand were OUTSTANDING! Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, Anika Noni Rose and Eddie Murphy were perfect for these roles. Beyonce was great too. However, I think she needs a little work on her acting but her singing is phenomenal! I loved her as Denna Jones, It was a perfect first role for her. Anika Noni Rose as good too! She not that well known but she is another wonderful Dream! And of course the extraordinary Jennifer Hudson. She is my absoulte favorite character! When she sings \\"And I'm Tell You\\" I am blown away. She does that song so well that I like her better than Jennifer Holiday sorry to say.  <br /> <br />Some great dance numbers include \\"Move, Stepin To The Bad Side, One Night Only, Dreamgirls, Love You I Do, Heavy, Fake Your Way To The Top. Plus the unforgettble ones like And I'm Telling You, I Want You Baby, Dreamgirls (Finale) and Family. Just Amazing! <br /> <br /> <br />So If you want an astonishing musical masterpiece, I would recomend this beautiful and so well done movie. Trust me, Once you see it you'll want to watch it again and again!
B00002SSKI|4.0|Although it is something of a chic flick, \\"Now and Then\\" is a great movie. I would watch having a youngster see it as there are some adult topics discussed. Each child character and her adult counter part, look so similar that it is amazing! It is a very well told narrative of young ladies coming to terms with growing up and all that it involves and holding onto friendship in spite of it all.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|If this brief review keeps one person from buying this album then it will be a success.  What happened to LP?  Every song on this album is worse than the worst song on either of their first albums.  I am very disappointed and if I could return the CD I would.  What happened to the heavy instrumentals? What happened to the lyricism?  What happened to the electronic influences?  Minutes to Midnight is worse than bad, it's BORING.
0316286850|5.0|Makeup bible, ultimate how-to, this book remains the Best book I have seen on the subject of working with color, proportion, shading, and highlighting to create a beautiful, symmetrical, gorgeous face. It is thorough and leaves no question unanswered.<br /><br />The book begins with the basics: anatomy of the face, foundational ingredients (moisturizer, simple tools, foundation types, powders, concealers) and moves on to techniques. There is an Amazing diagram on shading and highlighting on pg 24 that shows an exaggerated version of what goes on beneath the makeup to create the illusion of symmetry and highlight (or fake) high cheekbones, a lovely chinline, and beautiful eyes. It also discusses brows, eyes, lashes, lips, and then moves onto overall styles and looks. The way he explains with the text and shows with a combination of drawings and pictures makes it clear for anyone, whether a professional or beginner. Excellent resource!<br /><br />The looks themselves are extremely varied from subtle, minimal, and fresh, to smoky, sexy, and very dramatic. He begins with simple ideas on everyday people, but finishes off with celebrities looking like you have never seen them--you seriously have to find their names to figure out who they are, they look so different. These are examples of what different makeup can do, and for the theatre and fashion folks out there, this section provides you with so much inspiration and ideas--it is priceless!<br /><br />There is something here for every person and every occasion, so even those who don't like looking overly made up can look great. His pictures of friends, family, and of course, celebrities give this book both warmth and glamour, and his clear way of breaking down various techniques make this the most accessible, user-friendly, useful book I have read on this topic. I recommend it to anyone at all.
B00005OMTT|4.0|Great album with unique sound and sexy French voice. Clear sound with slightly heavy bass. Slightly tribal touch, but overall great music. Buy it if you like the previews on Amazon, you will not be disappointed. Relax and enjoy.
0316287059|5.0|While Aucoin's other book, Making Faces, is much more practical and useful, this one shows off what he can do and how much makeup can change a person's appearance; it demonstrates the concept of face as canvas, and with the before-afters featuring crazy feats like making Winona Ryder look like Elizabeth Taylor, transforming Gwyneth Paltrow into James Dean, or putting Edith Piaf's face on Christina Ricci.  <br /> <br />The first half of the book features the to-die-for advice on makeup basics, from the anatomy of a stocked makeup kit (brushes, powders, shadows, and dozens of others), crazy before-afters, break-downs of different looks and variations, notes on color, shading, concealing, doing eyebrows, eyes, cheeks, lips, etc.  <br /> <br />The second half does extreme looks that are more theatrical than those from his last book. They might not be things you would do unless you are involved in theatre...or like to pretend you are a geisha or an Elizabethan queen, but there are also plenty of wearable looks as well or elements from the crazy ones that give you a jumping off point for something more adventurous.  <br /> <br />Aucoin remains THE authority on makeup, and this book, while not integral to doing the basics, is a great companion to Making Faces, and the awesome pictures are, as always, shocking, inspirational, and above all, lots of fun to try on yourself.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Really a joy to listen to. Great to hear, AND see KWS getting back to the good stuff with an excellent tribute to these true American originals of music. The recording sound is awesome, feels like your there with them. The only downside to so many old blues recordings is the poor sound quality, although I like that sometimes, here it's great to hear what these old timers can deliver when supported by a great rhythm section, backup guitar and top-notch sound engineering. These fantastic recordings have preserved in time the great sound of original blues, a timely tribute especially after sadly hearing of several of them passing. <br /> <br />Many thanks to KWS, Double Trouble and all the others that made this happen!
B00003CXDD|5.0|I loved this movie when I was young!  I am still YOUNG BTW :P  Anyway, great movie, Val Kilmer is a hottie in this movie!  Love watching it, and always a joy to pop it in the DVD player.   <br /> <br />For the price, I had to add it to my collection!  Awesome movie!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This show is absolutely amazing. It includes years of footage which have been put together to produce episodes on the different regions of the world and the plants and animals that live there. The attention to detail is incredible. I would highly recommend this series for young children or anyone interested in plants, animals or nature in general. A must have!!!
B000026OWF|5.0|I was a 16-year-old when I heard \\"Steppin' in It.\\"  If anyone had told me that this was a fusion/jazz compilation, I would have given them the following response:  \\"I don't have a clue of what you're talking about, but I do know one thing, this music is from outer space!\\"<br /><br />I didn't know what to make of the music on this album, but it forced me to stretch my mind to accept what my ears were taking in.  As my focus was Dance music at the time, this album, though funky, was \\"different.\\"  It took time for me to appreciate what Herbie was laying down.<br /><br />Thirty-two years later, I can look back and say, \\"outstanding!\\"  Five stars for Herbie Hancock and \\"Man-Child.\\"
B000MQ54OY|5.0|Looks stunning in Blu Ray.  I have watched both versions, Standard and high def, both versions on Sony LCDs.  The Blu Ray does have noticable differences and definately worth a sale price.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|wow...its that good !! ... unreal .... best i have heard in a long long time...sounds like all the wilco cds put together....BUY IT NOW !!!
B00005JPAO|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie. I saw a side to the Queen and her Prime minister that I didn't know exsisted. I hope it's true.
B00004RF8J|4.0|This is a pretty good movie, except for all the singing....I know it's that type of movie, but I don't care for it.  But I love the plot!
B000JJRIN4|1.0|\\"The Sweet Escape\\" is just exactly what we need more of: shallow, atrocious, overrated filler that's saturating our society.  <br /> <br />The album is started off with the ear-grinding, superficial \\"Wind It Up\\", which just seems to be a shameless self-promotion of her fashion line from a recycled copy of Hollaback Girl. <br /> <br />Then, it's followed up by \\"The Sweet Escape\\", which is tolerable, but extremely mediocre at best. <br /> <br />\\"Orange County Girl\\" is faux-rap. Bad faux-rap coupled with Gwen's annoyingly whiny vocals. <br /> <br />Tracks 4 and 6, \\"Early Winter\\" and \\"4 in the Morning\\", are nice ballads. But they're just anything that any good singer at the karaoke can do. <br /> <br />Tracks 5 and 7 completely take away any benefit the last two mentioned tracks had. The musical quality of them is bland, and their self-obsessed lyrics just make them worse. <br /> <br />Track 8, \\"Florescent\\" could've been nice, if Gwen's vocals weren't so annoying. <br /> <br />The next three tracks continue to go downhill with the album's superficial, bland pattern. <br /> <br />The album ends on a slightly nice note with track 12. However, none of the nice tracks in this album can make the album any nicer. <br /> <br />Final verdict: Please don't support horrible, over rated junk from coming out and save your money on something better.
1582701709|1.0|Goodness me. What a lot of rubbish. I can't believe you silly fools have gone for this.  <br /> <br />Can't you see it's absurd? <br /> <br />This is even more ridiculous than the Bible. At least that had some interesting STORIES.  <br /> <br />This will rot your brain. <br /> <br />Read some real science and go outside more often. That's my SECRET. <br /> <br />Good lord.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I was ecstatic that they were having a new album, but I'm not only disappointed in it, I'm annoyed.  Not only is the album worse than their previous ones, but the CD sucks in itself.   <br /> <br />It's not something I can listen to again, except for about 4 tracks.  Most of the songs are much slower (but not in that good 'My December' way) and do not have that rhytmical rock quality that I so loved.  They need faster guitar melodys and way more drums.  Better luck next time, I hope.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This is an amazing documentary that everyone should see.  It is factually based and should cause everyone to think about the course that the human race is  on.  The movie was promptyly delivered by Amazon.com
B00005JLEU|5.0|When I first saw Spirited Away I became a convert to Hayao Miyazaki's work. I went an got all of them. I wait like Harry Potter fans for the next film. This may be his best. You may prefer one of his others. Your problem. It is some of the best animation I have seen, not in a technical sense of making everything look real. But, in the sense that the animation tells the story.  The characters are real characters. It may stretch out; there was a point when I wonder if parts could've tighter. By the end it picks up again. A little knowledge of Japanese mythology adds another layer to an appreciation of the story.
B000NA28IE|4.0|This was a pretty good movie, however, I expected more when I seen the previews.  I wanted to watch it in the theatre, but never had time last <br />Dec.  The story is pretty good.  It could have been a little longer though.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The Brits do superb documentaries and this is one we will view repeatedly.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Stunning photography.  Soaring mountains, sweeping landscapes, endless seas - not to mention wonderful creatures from giant blue whales down to tiny, adorable Mouse lemurs. From great forests to tiny fungi, from towering cave pilars down to ozzing snotties, fish who thrive in acid, and birds that thrive in Antarctic storms.  If the mission of this series was to remind us all that we need to look no farther than our own back yards to see beauties and wonders greater than anything so far found among the stars, then it has succeeded wildly. This is one series of programs you will watch over and over and over...
B000HCO840|5.0|Many viewers leave the theatre as the credits start to roll or turn off the DVD at that same point. If they do, they miss a very important added scene that follows the lengthy credits. It is a REAL SURPRISE so will not add a spoiler. <br /> <br />As for the main film, it is a rather nice extension of the X-Men saga. Not great or as good as the first two, but taken for what it is, it's rather enjoyable and better than most third follow up films. <br /> <br />WATCH THAT LAST SURPRISE SCENE!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Very good album that I ran through a dozen times a day since its release. The sound is different, we know, but it still has an impact if you sit and absorb it for a while (an open mind required). I'm glad they don't necessarily bash the downloaders, but simply tell them to listen to the tracks in sequence to get the \\"effect.\\" And it's nice to see money isn't a factor (they're loaded as it is) and some thought is put into it. The songs blend together smoothly. <br /> <br />\\"Wake\\" and \\"Leave It Out The Rest\\" have powerful duo guitars towards the end, \\"Given Up\\" is extra catchy thanks to that clapping while \\"What I've Done\\" has that catchy guitar chorus, the end of \\"Hands Held High\\" with Chester joining in reminds me of \\"Numb\\" for some reason, \\"No More Sorrow\\" has a great pounding intro, \\"In Between\\" is a good eye of the storm, so to speak, with a mellow feel, and \\"The Little Things...\\" builds up separate elements into a wicked outro, and that's a wrap. For everyone wanting a nu-metal feel, I'm sure they'll delve back into it if they feel like it.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|You will love this one!  I think the story will keep anyone on their toes. <br />It's a hot movie!  I love the werewolf and the vampires!  Just great!  Everyone should own this one.....great fantasy, very tasteful!
B000MXPE74|5.0|The Fratellis are the funky, punky, rock.  Energy that gets you going and gets you beating your head as you're driving down the road.  I tried for awhile to draw a comparison to a US band and to be honest, can't think of any...it's an original sound that will keep you hooked from track to track.  Henrietta, Whistle Choir are faves, but really, the whole thing rocks.
B00095MLGC|5.0|[[ASIN:B00095MLGC Up the Downstair]]This is the remastered edition to replace the orginal cd in my collection.  Great sound quality and bonus cd.  I love the new trend of remasters with bonus cd's.  It makes the decision to update something you already have easier.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Planet Earth is an amazing documentary.  We wanted something to show off our HD tv and our blu ray player-- we were not disapointed. The film is so incredible, and interesting and holds up for repeat viewing. Its also great family viewing, except when the preditors attack, we have to fast forward for my 7 yr old son.
074356619X|4.0|I enjoyed listening to this 4 CD Set. With four hours of audio you get a better, in depth understanding of The Secret, with more examples of how to apply the principals.  Just remember though that Action is a key component to the Laws of Attraction. Also remember to welcome 'challenges' in your goals for growth and so they are balanced.
B00000JPH6|4.0|This is a pretty good movie, it was better to me when I was little though :)  Since technology has come so far along now.  I couldn't get over the price though, it was $6.99 so I couldn't resist adding it to my collection. <br /> <br />An all time favorite!
B000OCXFCO|5.0|If you've been with Megadeth from the beginning, you've been craving an album where Dave finally goes back to his roots...and it's arrived!  If you've been a fan of the \\"progressive\\" Megadeth of the past decade, this one's going to send you running for cover!<br /><br />I'm surprised this was advertised as a \\"cast\\" album...I don't see from where that label came.  This is 100% pure Megadeth, as they began in the mid eighties...fast and heavy, with signature Mustane complex rifts.  It seems that Dave has found a younger, more energetic band to back him up (none of the regulars that have appeared over the years), and the youth comes through.  I won't go over the track list, but they are all different...the only thing longtime fans might take as a recycle is the inclusion of \\"A Tout Le Monde\\".  Do not be fooled.  This isn't the same old ballad...it's faster and heavier than the original, and not only that, but it's a duet with Cristina Scabbia...the new version is unbelievable!<br /><br />This one will leave you speechless.  Dave, I bow before you, and thanks for giving us pure metal in an age of mindless ghetto garbage!  Everyone, just say I warned you if your stereo erupts into smoke and flames before the CD is finished!
0440241030|5.0|I've been a fan of the Jack Reacher novels since the beginning and though each of them is a powerhouse in its own right, The Hard Way gets my vote as the very best of the lot....and that's saying something.<br /><br />Reacher has never been more calculating, tougher or more heroic...and Lee Child has never shown a more commanding hand at guiding us around the twists and turns of this dynamic and always surprising plot.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Carole King can tell stories with her songs.  I love the soulful way she sings.  This is indeed one of the best
B00005JPCF|5.0|We went to watch this opening night, mainly b/c there was a Harry Potter trailer we wanted to see!  But this is a GREAT movie!  The animation was incredible, and I enjoyed every minute of this movie!  You have to see this!  Once seen, you will want to own it :) <br /> <br />ADD it to your cart today!
B00005ONMP|5.0|By my calculations, this is the single best set of Mendelssohn symphonies out there today.  Though better versions of the \\"Reformation,\\" \\"Scottish,\\" and \\"Italian\\" Symphonies exist in other disks, I still like the interpretations offered by Abbado and the LSO.   <br /> <br />For the \\"Reformation\\", and \\"Italian\\" Symphonies, I'd recommend John Eliot Gardiner and the Vienna Philharmonic's DG set.   <br /> <br />For the Scottish Symphony I'd go with Karajan's recording with the BPO (that CD also comes with the best \\"Hebrides Overture\\" recording available, and a pretty good \\"Italian Symphony\\" interpretation, too). <br /> <br />All of the overtures in this set are performed very well, both in technical execution and musical interpretation.  The Hebrides (a work far ahead of its time), in particular, is a fine recording.  So is \\"Overture 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'.\\"  I really have grown fond of the \\"Ruy Blas\\" overture as well. <br /> <br />Another reviewer complained that the interpretations in this set are \\"too Classical.\\"  I think they are correct in saying the set is Classically performed, but I think that works with Mendelssohn, as he was \\"the Romantic Mozart.\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Overall this is a great set, and a good way to become familiar with the music of Felix Mendelssohn, or build your Mendelssohn library.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|incredible shots like you have never seen before. HD is the best way to appreciate the work that went into creating 11 mind blowing episodes. The best purchase i've made in years and has a very high replay value. Gift this series to your friends and family.
1569242739|5.0|Enough said.  Whether you're vegan or not, the recipes are fantastic.
0790731479|4.0|This is a crazy movie!  Never seen another like it, or in it's class!!  Really enjoyed it :)  This one is worth owning!  Gotta love the plot of this movie, and the actors!
0789723107|5.0|The book arrived in excellent condition.  I'm pleased.
1894502701|5.0|This book is the ultimate \\"cruel book\\" to give to new parents.<br /><br />The thing about this book is that if you have any sense of humanity in you, you will have problems finishing this book.<br /><br />What do I mean??<br /><br />Sit on the floor with your child on your lap and begin to read this book.  By the end of the book you will be crying and blubbering like a baby.  This book's effect only increases as you read it more.<br /><br />Good Luck To All New Parents & If you have a new baby get this book !!!
B000OCXFCO|4.0|Being a fan of Megadeth since Peace Sells,this new one is not bad at all.I did like Mustaine's last couple of efforts,after the huge successes of Cryptic Writings,Countdown To Extinction and Youthanasia. Risk was a risk,but not the worst. Anyway,United Abominations has some good rockers and one revamped song,which I thought should have stayed on Youthanasia,of course that is the song,A Tout Le Monde.This new version isn't bad with Cristina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil,who I am a big fan of too,but not necessary. But that is the biz,nowadays. The standouts on the album are...Sleepwalker,Washington Is Next!,United Abominations,Gears of War,Play For Blood,Amerikhastan and Burnt Ice.<br />Mustaine continues to share his political views, as he has, since he has been writing songs.If you're a Megadeth and Mustaine fan,you know all about it.It comes with the territory and it wouldn't be Dave,if he wasn't controversial.If your'e thinking about buying this one,I don't see the harm. New ,old or whatever fan.I will be a fan of Megadeth until the last day. Mustaine is the real deal!!!!!<br />Buy it!!!!!!!!!!
B00009ZYBY|5.0|If you don't own this yet, please ADD TO CART now.  This is an amazing movie, and when I put it in the DVD, I am always sad to see it end the way it does.  But IT is a MUST have. <br /> <br />I wish I could give it 10 STARS.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Seriously wtf happened? LP now sounds like an emo band. I wish they would have spent more than minutes to midnight on thinking up song ideas for this one. THe energy we love about LP is gone. So is Shinoda and Chester feeding off each others energy. Track 7 sounds like it should be a Fort Minor song...so why is it on here? Given up and No More Sorrow and Bleed It Out are great but the rest of the songs sink faster than the Titanic. <br />Valentines Day? What sort of song is that...some poppy song thats what...just like the rest of the songs except for the 3 I mentioned. What Ive Done is stomachable but not great. Wheres M.r Han? Nowhere is is his presence felt. I would have felt that a Meteora V2 would have been better.Why change your style to please the mainstream? This isnt Metal...this is Emo Pop. Also Chesters vocals are screwed up on this album completely. An utter dissapointment...just download it for free...don't waste money on this album....it really is terrible...listen to all their stuff before this and even before they were LP and you'll get a glimpse of their prior genius. <br />
B000O75F7C|5.0|Another great record by Porcupine Tree, partially anticipated (in my opinion) on Blackfield II for some soundings. Thrilling, emotional and a terrificly superb Steve Wilson.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|It takes a while to figure out what you're good at. It's not easy for a black man to get ahead in this cold world; you must persue your dream against all odds.  Nine times out of ten the journey is more important for character and integrity than the goal. That goes for anybody, but nevertheless, this Will Smith vehicle works on all levels. Come on kids!  You can do it too!
B000O599ZS|5.0|The Searchers is one of the greatest films ever made.<br /><br />However, you will only find this out by watching it a few times.<br /><br />I bought the DVD on the strength of Scorcese rating as one of his top five films. On first viewing I thought it was OK, but subsequent viewings have confirmed Scorcese's view.<br /><br />You have to view the film in context. This was made in 1956, by a director who had been working in films from the 1930's. Unlike modern films the pace is leisurely and the character development is measured. Even compared with say the first Clint Eastwood dollars movie (8 or 9 years later) this is filmmaking from a different era.<br /><br />The story is simple Ethan's niece (a young Natalie Wood) is kidnapped by Indians. Ethan (John Wayne) vows to find her and then (after time has gone by) to kill her (as she has presumably been abused by the Indians). There is no question this is John Waynes best acting performance.<br /><br />A previous reviewer has critised the portrayal of Indians as savages, and some of the interior (exterior) sets - but like I said above this is a film that has to viewed in context. The special effects options when shooting in the studio in 1956 were very limited.<br /><br />The use of Monument Valley is marvellous, and many scenes benefit from this natural wonder, however the greatest scene is reserved for the climax to the film which I'm not going to tell you about!<br /><br />John Fords direction is mostly straightforward, but occasionally a classic shot will happen (like the framed doorway) and you realise what an influence this film has had.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|megadeth is the one band I have stuck with through the years. I bought this album first thing and was greatly pleased. it is just a solid album all the way through. the quality is definitely the level of 'countdown', 'youthanasia', and (in my opinion best overall) 'rust in peace'. i have all the original discs, as well as the remasters, and I would proudly put this album in that collection. while I have never found anything wrong with any of the band's releases, I must say this album goes away from any commercialistic attention the band had brought on with album like 'risk' and 'cryptic writings'.  <br /> <br />anyways... great album... especially after listening to it a couple times. key tracks would be 'sleepwalker' and 'gears of war'.
B000O178BY|5.0|a sort of unpredictable return to the past for NiN... hope to see them perform soon
B000K4WLXA|5.0|If you are a ffvii fan you will love this
B00002616T|5.0|This is my favourite 70's Jazz album.<br /><br />A marvellous quartet of musicians, featuring Keith Jarrett on Piano and Jan Garbarek on Sax. A wide range of styles from the Gospel influenced \\"Long as Your...\\" to frankly undefineable (but brilliant) pieces like \\"The Windup\\". Spiral Dance is another stand-out track. The key thing about this album, is that it is an entirely accoustic album, made in an era when the trend in Jazz was for more electric fusion based bands.<br /><br />The musicianship is of the highest order, and the compositions are mostly written by Jarrett.<br /><br />Have a listen to the samples on Amazon - unless you're a die-hard dixieland/trad fan there will be something here for you.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Astonishing pictures - I would have loved even more stories about the photographers and the hurculean task they performed in getting these pictures.<br /><br />We are living in the Garden of Eden and this series proves it.  I hope this series ends up in every elementary school, junior high school and high school science curriculum.  I don't know how we can shrug off the obligation to be good stewards of the amazing miracle we have been given to enjoy - Planet Earth.  May we each commit to contribute to the quality, sustainability and diversity of life on this good Earth.
3832790810|4.0|I like this book and the quality is superb, the models are beautiful, and the poses are excellent.  However, I thought that the same could have been accomplished in a smaller size and shorter version which would have saved on cost and price.  It got a little repetitive as it went on, in my opionion. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book as one of the best ones out there for nude/erotic photography.  It's classy and it really highlights beautiful female form with excellent lighting.  What I also enjoyed is that the sets are all environmental and not studio.  I hate those studio nudes that look so fake and posed.  It was a good learning book for me.
0807126063|4.0|At first I couldn't decide whether I loved this book or hated it. Now, having quickly turned the pages, finding I couldn't put it down, and finishing it in two weekdays, I think I like it! I don't particularly like the characters (these are not the kind of people I would want to be friends with) but found them fascinating to observe in a reality television fishbowl kind of way. The fact that there is no plot per se, was actually fine with me. I just read the book as a series of misadventures and enjoyed the ride. The characterizations and absurdities brought to mind Catch-22 and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. <br />The dialogue is quite clever and the dialects superb. It's unfortunate Toole didn't live to continue his writing career.
1400063515|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It is full of deep thoughts and there are many intellectual diamonds to be unearthed. On top of that it is highly entertaining - Taleb has a great style!
B000002GY9|5.0|For those of you unfamiliar with Tom Waits, the man with a voice that sounds like he has been swallowing the contents of many, many ashtrays over the period of decades; all the while maintaining the atmosphere of a truly masterful storyteller, this album is for you.  In fact, this album is for everyone.  (Well, anyone eighteen or older!)  Some of the songs here would make modern day rap/hip hop fans a little shifty in their oversized sneakers.  Two of the most popular tunes, here, are \\"Step Right Up\\" and \\"Small Change.\\" Tom Waits' gritty, unabashedly blunt portraits of urban street (and sewer) life are gritty, at times a little nauseating, but so charismatically delivered over minimalist accompaniment (only the blaring of a saxophone), that he commands your attention, and you can't help but listen.
B000JJRIP2|5.0|If you are looking at KISS cds on this website, you obviously like them.  And if you like KISS, then this set is worth it.  No Question.
B00064WSN2|5.0|Okay, this may be similar to their debut album In the Court of the Crimson King, but it is longer and just as good. It has a great variety of tracks from soft and moody (Cadence and Cascade) to funky (Pictures of a City) to just plain fun (Cat Food). This is an essential buy for King Crimson fans.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I really liked Will Ferrell in Talladega Nights-he was very funny and a good choice for the role.  However, I didn't love it.  I personally thought that it wasn't the perfect type of character for Ferrell.  I had heard very little about Stranger than Fiction-just that it was good.  I rented it expecting a somewhat stupid comedy (which I like, but am quite frankly a little sick of).<br /><br />Take my word for it-THIS IS NOT A STUPID MOVIE!!!!!!<br /><br />This film is very well done!  This is the perfect type of role for Ferrell!  I was impressed a lot by this movie.  The cast was perfect.<br /><br />Here's how I usually work: I watch about half of a movie, check how much time is left, find a chapter switch and stop it.  None of that applied for this one.  One sitting.  That's saying a lot for me!<br /><br />If Will Ferrell isn't your cup of tea, watch Stranger than Fiction.  You will see a new side of him.<br /><br />A very high 5 stars.
B000002I25|5.0|If you want to listen to a great example of the psychedelic rock of the 1960s, played by one of the most definitive bands of that generation (and perhaps of all time), look no further than The Doors' self-titled album (originally released in 1966).  Lead singer Jim Morrison was the stuff of legends, for reasons that are very apparent.  He was a highly charismatic (and, at times, very unsettling) figurehead of his generation, and a rock music icon that continues to haunt people today, as a fallen legend.  The bands' penchant for excessive drug use is alluded to on many occasions on this album (hence, that is why they call it psychedelic rock--this music was composed specifically for the purpose of appealing to people sailing off on to acid trip induced journeys in their minds).<br /><br />Though, I have never done a drug in my life, even I felt high after listening to these songs.  Some of the most well-known and appreciated songs from The Doors' repertoire are featured here.  They include \\"Break on Through (To the Other Side),\\" \\"The Crystal Ship,\\" \\"Light My Fire,\\"  and \\"The End.\\"  (among others)  Between Jim Morrison's piercing and (no doubt) slightly menacing vocals, charged guitar and percussive work from the other musicians and lyrics rich with double (and triple) entendre, you'll come away from this music feeling more than slightly rummy.  Then, once you come down from that contact high, you'll want to go on that trip all over again.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|So first let me say that I love most of this album, but I have to say the whole anti-war/Bush thing is getting a little old.  I never thought that LP would stoop to the level of the Dixie Chicks, but that's exactly what they did in the song Hands Held High.  Why can't people leave this out of their music?  I can't wait until 2008 when people don't have anything to bitch and complain about anymore, oh never mind they will still do the same with the next guy.  If you can do a better job than by all means stand up and do it. <br /> <br />That being said, I still like the rest of the CD. <br />
B00005JPFF|4.0|Now I watched the first two Spider-Man flicks recently. (The day before seeing this one, in fact)  And in all truth, I really enjoyed it and believed this was another step that Peter Parker/Spider-Man had to endure.  Not as much character development, but we've had so much in the first two that who cares ..... I loved it for what it was, a MOVIE.  I do fear for the next part of the Spider-Man Saga, seeing as Tobey and Kirsten are not too sure about coming back.  But who knows? Score from me B-
B000OCXMAE|5.0|<br /> <br />Minutes to midnight is awesome I have listened to LP's  music since day one and I am glad these guys changed up their sound a bit. Mike's  right who wants to hear the same exact songs over and over and over . It was time for a new change. M2M ROCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002HH2|5.0|This was my introduction to Bjork, and, though, I realize that POST came after DEBUT, and long after her career with The Sugarcubes, her first band back in Iceland, this was her true debut in my eyes.  For starters, I got my start listening to her music because of one of her songs on this album, \\"Army of Me,\\" the post-apocalyptic tune featured on Lori Petty's equally post-apocalyptic TANK GIRL, a really trippy film from the early mid-1990s.  I actually danced to this music in a jazz dance class, as a young teenager (yes, I realize that dates me! haha).<br /><br />How would I desribe this album?  Well, probably the better question is \\"how wouldn't I describe this album.\\"  There is truly something for everyone here.  Bjork has a great, playful flair for working and experimenting with electronica (\\"Hyperballad\\"), as well as channeling her numerous other styles--one of my favorites is \\"It's Oh So Quiet,\\" a great, and wonderfully whimsical departure from her edginess.  She almost sounds like a slightly coked up Barbra Streisand, and the big band sound is absolutely infectious. What's more, the video is great!  If you get a chance, you should really check it out.  It was directed by the wonderfully creative Spike Jonze, that features Bjork in what looks like a deleted scene from a really surreal Gene Kelly musical.  She's dancing with numerous back-up dancers dressed up in elaborate costumes (my favorite being a dancing mailbox!).  I also love \\"Isobel,\\" \\"My Headphones,\\" and probably all of the songs. They all succeed at being incomparably trippy and deeply poetic.  I think I fell in love with (and came to appreciate) Bjork's music, the day I heard this and I haven't stopped since!
B000002IAS|5.0|What, you say, by some group named Delaney and Bonnie (Bramlett)?  Whose biggest fault may have been to risk their own roles by making buddies out of the biggest names in rock and roll such as Eric Clapton, Dave Mason, and so on.  The participants here went on to form the core of Derek and the Dominoes (Clapton, Carl Radle from the band Colours, solo artist Bobby Whitlock, drummer Jim Gordon).<br />Imagine a musical locomotive driven along by the constant chug of some solid soul and rock'n roll.  Everything you would want, including the super-session-men horn section of Bobby Keys and Jim Price.<br />Wait, we forgot about the Bramletts. They never got the recognition they deserved, on their own.  Bonnie's vocals were as soulful as anything you could ask for.  And Delaney, while perhaps not quite so standout as his beautiful companion, could emote pretty well himself.<br />You will play this, and play it again, and play it again.
0751532711|4.0|Though far from perfect I found the book inspirational. Critics have bashed it, yet still after many years it remains an all time best seller. Detail is certainly not great, however the story about how we view life / business / money is.  <br /> <br />Entrepreneurs are to be admired and revered in my opinion. Their knowledge, creativity and perseverance is some of made our country great. To be in charge of your own destiny and to know some of the ground rules (this book helps) as to what it takes is awesome.  <br /> <br />Entrepreneurs are what will lead us and allow us to maintain dominance in this century. I believe that we will face challenges but our spirit for being independent and always pushing forward will persevere. Competition has never been tougher. The book provides hope.

0743277457|5.0|Josh eloquently escorts the reader through the process of becoming a champion. He is very candid in his demystification of how one becomes a master. In a very lively manner Josh describes the hard work, the setbacks, self examination, and   the lessons which are the steps to mastery. \\"Kung Fu\\" is after all an accumulation of work which one puts in to practice. Josh's accounts are full of dedication and devotion to these discilpines and the love of the art and the creative process with which he soars after building his fundamentals. It's his love and enthusiasm that comes through on each page and makes this book so enjoyable. I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to work towards mastery of an art form or sport. <br />Michael Krubiner
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I considered myself a fan, but after giving this collection of songs a thorough listening, I came away with the feeling that the band attempts to substitute their personal political viewpoints for music.  I, for one, don't buy it.  Even though a few tunes rise to their former level of energy, the remainder of these songs run out of gas before the tracks end.  Let's not allow today's corporate music juggernaut to say what's quality,... this LP outing is only fair at best.  If you want to get on your soapbox guys, CNN & Time magazine would be happy to give you an interview.  But as for music?... just return to the drawing board & do what you seem to do best.
B000244FDW|5.0|First I am going to state that Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book and I have read my copy so often that it's falling apart. The poor thing. But because of my love for the book, I have watched many of the attempts to bring it to life through the screen. I have seen the 1940's version with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier, the 1995 version with Colin Firth, the 2005 version with Kira Knightly and this 1980 version from the BBC. This one is the best. period. It stays loyal to the book even using some of the exact language that Austin wrote all those years ago. If you were studying Pride and Prejudice in school and didn't want to read the book, you could watch this movie and read the epilogue at the end of the book, and you would be able to hold your own with proper discussions of the book. Not that I would recommend anyone NOT read the book! But this adaptation of the story is beautifully done. The costumes, the location, the music, and the script all blend together to transport you into a world that Jane Austin created. Please watch it and enjoy.
B00005JKHP|1.0|A more terrible hatchet job I have never seen.  They took out a half-hour of dialogue, including a sub-plot essential to the end of the movie and put in a bunch of half-finished special effects shots.  It actually makes the movie look cheesier to update the FX.  (In one case, half the background is gone!  Kirk & McCoy are talking in his quarters, and instead of leaving in the original where the camera cuts back and forth to each of their faces, they took a shot of both of them standing facing each other from 20 min later in the movie and dropped it on the scene.  Lame, yes, but what's worse is that the bottom half of the wall is gone!  Cummon.  They butchered this movie.  Just get a VHS copy of it and burn it to DVD.  Do yourself a favor.)
B000NVIGC0|4.0|I feel lucky. I'm a fan of Wilco--have seen them a couple times, have at least half of all their albums, have heard the rest here & there--I recognize that Jeff Tweedy is one brilliant musician. My luck comes from the fact that I'm not such a heavily invested fan that I have all of these HUGE EXPECTATIONS of their records before they come out. I can just listen and enjoy them simply for what they are--special collections of brilliant songwriting and musicianship. All of them.  <br /> <br />That said, Sky Blue Sky is definitely a special collection of brilliant songwriting and musicianship. I loved it from the first play. Absolutely worth hearing and enjoying over & over again.
B000NVIXDW|2.0|I am a big fan and this CD is sloppy.  The recordings sound unrehearsed and MB mumbles so badly in several that the only way I know what he's singing is because I already know the lyrics from previous recordings.    This is his poorest CD and I am very, very disappointed.
B00005MP58|5.0|I would definately put this one on the classic list.  It's GREAT.  Just loved the screen play and the capture of the book.  Characters were greatly done.  The ONLY thing I do not like about this is the TWO disk part.  Wish it came in ONE disk that way I can sit for hours straight in a dreamy mood and lose myself.  If you are a hopeless romantic and like relaxing dramas, then this one is for you.
B000001FTD|4.0|I'll admit, I didn't get this album until 1996, because I was only 6 when it came out, but once I did, I don't think I listened to anything else (besides Persistence of Time) for about a year.  The only factor that takes away that 5th star is the lyrics.  They're a little corny, I'm sorry.  But the songs are so good, and they're delivered well, everything's made up for in the end.  Excellent, excellent album.
B00000IMTF|5.0|This absolutely one of the best rock albums of all time for me! This my third copy of the album already. I've got the first copy way back in the late seventies. Played the LP almost every day so it got worn out until it came to a point where I don't like to play it anymore. I bought again the LP in the 80s. When I came to know of Amazon.com I bought it also in CD. <br />Songs like Stargazer, A Light In The Black, Tarot Woman and Do You Close Your Eyes are some of my favorites rock songs of all time too. <br />Listen to Ritchie Blackmore, RJD, Jimmy Bain, Tony Carey and Cozy Powell on this album! This is a master piece in rock! <br />
B00005176F|5.0|Not just great Brit Pop - actually - just great Music!  There is so much more to Blur than \\"Song 2\\" (woo-hoo!)  After getting into the Gorillaz with Damon Albarn - I bought this disc and discovered what I missed the first time around.  Blur's songwriting is very strong and this Best Of disc showcases the depth and variety of their musicianship.  Now, if only they would reunite and tour the US!
0743496728|5.0|I hesitated to read this book because of what happened at Virginia Tech. I am now very glad I did. I have read most of Jodi Picoults work. This book was very well written. She told all sides that were involved. I was very moved by this book and would recommend it to everyone.
B00004RE7C|5.0|It's really hard to follow something like Wrath Of Khan, but this is how you do it.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|When I first heard Machine Head a few years back, I dismissed them as your stereotypical nu-metal band trying to cash in on the trend.  I was ignorant to Burn My Eyes and didn't bother noticing Through the Ashes of Empires. <br /> <br />Well, one night while wandering around my local hypermarket, I saw The Blackening in the CD rack.  I remembered reading some decent articles on it in Revolver and Decibel and, without even having heard a track, took a gamble and bought the CD. <br /> <br />What a great idea that was. <br /> <br />The album has 8 tracks, yet is over an hour long.  Every song is so over the top that it's pure metal decadence.  \\"Clenching the Fists of Dissent\\", the opening track, is over 10 minutes and barely prepares you for all of the bone-jarring breakdowns, high-flying solos, pounding drums, and anti-establishment lyrics that this album throws at you.  I could go on and list all of the highlights of the songs on this album, but it's best stated that this album serves as an example of what's right in modern thrash metal.  If you're a bigger fan of songs that are direct and to the point, then you'd probably get a big kick out of \\"Beautiful Mourning\\", \\"Aesthetics of Hate\\", and \\"Slanderous\\".  However, the songs that stood out to me on the album to be the best are the ones that I considered the most melodic and progressive:  \\"Clenching the Fists of Dissent\\", \\"Now I Lay Thee Down\\", and my personal favorite \\"A Farewell to Arms.\\" <br /> <br />Again, \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" is in my opinion the most outstanding song on album, not to mention the song that I feel best summarizes the elements found throughout the album. <br /> <br />This album makes me ask so many questions:  What if Phil Demmel was in the band earlier?  What if Roadrunner didn't try pushing them into nu-metal when that style was popular?  Would this album be considered as great as it is if Metallica (one of their larger influences) still wrote music with this type of tenacity?  You know what, forget the questions and go with the now:  This album rules!   <br /> <br />Bottom line:  If you haven't bought this album already, you're wasting time!  Get it now!
B000OCXMAE|3.0|i think this an alright cd. i own now (a friend gave it to me who works at best buy) it but i had it when it leaked. the sound change makes this cd bad. the lyrics and the music written is good. the main aspect is that linkin park was the band that everyone liked no matter what kind of music a person listen to. my main dissappointment is that on older LP cds both singers were on each song and now its like LP has broken up to two different bands. well.............a band always makes a flop cd and here it is...........M2M! oh yeah don't buy it if your used to old LP get a burned copy check it out and if you can stomach it.....well....pick it =up......(not the deluxe edition!!)
B0002NRQTI|5.0|Thank God!!! In many Rush fan circles, Counterparts is possibly the most underrated album in the band's entire repertoire. It's good to see these reviews. I personally believe its Rush's best album since Moving Pictures. I know thats drastic to some, but even ex-Rush fans give this album a lot of praise (like my brother). Lyrically this album is among the best of any Rush album with the possible exception of the classic Rush period up to Moving Pictures. I put this album above Grace and Power Windows because I believe it is lyrically superior, but also that it is far more daring and experimental while also bringing the guitar driven roots back the band's work. Thanks for reading.  -Chris
B000MNP2KI|1.0|I was not able to view the movie, only the extras disc.was able to play; We tried 2 different movies. The delivery service and response to my problem, was very efficient.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Alice in Wonderland includes story lines from Through the Looking Glass so I had my class read both books before showing the movie. The tale was written as a summer diversion for a precocious child and, done as a musical cartoon, provides a willing suspension of disbelief. I also teach Spanish and played a segment in Spanish for those classes.  The dialogue was beyond my second year students who soon lost interest.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|The Arctic Monkeys are hopelessly cute and talented kids, and yet they make very grown-up rock.  This album is darker, harder, and more difficult than the first, but it's got at least as many pop hooks, romantic moments, and devilishly clever quips--in other words, you're going to love it.  The range of songs here is impressive: from the hardcore Brianstorm (the punks were moshing hard to this one at the show I saw) to the sensitive-guy tale of romantic regret of \\"Do Me a Favour.\\"   <br /> <br />Speaking of romantic regret, it's astonishing that Alex Turner is the same lyricist who wrote the wide-eyed tale of prostitution \\"They Say It Changes When the Sun Goes Down.\\"  No longer shocked and fascinated by the seedy side of life, in \\"Fluorescent Adolescent\\" he croons with jaded amusement:  \\"You used to get it in your fishnets/Now you only get it in your night dress/Traded in your naughty nights for niceness/Landed in a very common crisis.\\" <br /> <br />Part of Turner's appeal is that he is able to tell a story with equal veritas from either the point of view of a man or that of a woman--and yet his male characters are guys' guys, working class men who can't deal with their own emotions, let alone that of others.  \\"505\\" is about a guy always running away from a relationship and his emotions, and realizing, he hopes before it's too late, how desperately he wants to be with his beloved.  \\"I'm going back to 505,\\" he sings, and the music evokes a 90 mile-per-hour drive down a deserted night highway,\\"if it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five minute drive/In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side/with your hands between your thighs.\\"  It's a slow, quiet song, the passion brutally contained, until Alex screams out, \\"I crumble completely when you cry,\\" and we suddenly know the whole history of this relationship, and how deeply he needs it to work.  We hear a young man struggling to grow up and be worthy of love. <br /> <br />The music shows an impressive ability toabsorb ideas from other bands without sounding derivative.  The guitars are flawless and the drumming athletic and inspiring.  The singing is brilliant as well, and it's too bad that Alex's talent as a lyricist has overshadowed his talent as a vocal stylist.
B000MTFDCO|5.0|I've always found this to be one of the most underrated films Michael Douglas has ever made.  It got swept under the rug pretty quickly, which is a shame because the movie is like putting together a puzzle, a puzzle which could end up several different ways at the end, so you never know whats going to happen.  The only drawback to the movie is that in a way, it is like the Sixth Sense, in that once you watch it once, and know whats going to happen, it loses a little umph the next time you view it.   <br /> <br />Now as for the quality of this HD-DVD.  I would say the PQ is barely better than a really good standard DVD, and that is a shame. <br /> <br />The Regular DVD of The Game is absolutely awful, so I'm glad that it is available on HD-DVD.  I just wish they would have done a better job with it.  Oh and some special features would have been appreciated as well.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|A very interesting account of how business was conducted by CIA. And a not so interesting account of how the Bay of Pig's operation was compromised. The film would have been more realistic if the writers would have suggested that Rachell Welch was performing at a strip club and all the support that was required for the Bay of Pig's to be successful was at the show; I would have givin more stars for that scenario!

0582403855|4.0|For both soon-to-be and established teachers, Harmer's book is a good introduction to the research behind English language learning and thus the more effective ways of teaching. It is short on specific teaching ideas, but that isn't its point.  He points out ways that people learn, what some of the difficulties of learning English are and how to work on specific areas. I've found the book very helpful in becoming a better, more knowledgeable EFL teacher.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Such a powerful film.  It was great to get this product in excellent condition.
B00005O3VD|3.0|This used to be one of my favorite movies.  The songs are spectacular, and the telling of Fanny Brice's rise to stardom is a lot of fun.  Once she has it all, the movie tends to drag.  It's an interesting perspective on how we might look at life, however - it's the struggle to get somewhere that most intrigues us.  Once we get there, it's no fun anymore.  That's why this is a must see once movie - and you will want a CD of the music.
0099422697|5.0|Kepesh's fascination and obsession with Consuela's breasts and his pathetic desire for her when she wasn't with him was astounding.  How long can one really carry on with an obsession?  Apparently, forever.  And though he used her for her body, it was the cause of his torment and the standard by which she measured other sexual encounters, showing the strongest aphrodisiac may simply be being desired.<br /><br />What I found most refreshing is that Roth isn't censored and some of the scenes and lines made me laugh out loud, which I felt was inappropriate at first but is one of the reasons I thoroughly enjoyed reading.  He really has a knack for illuminating the inner workings of the human psyche--the things most people try to hide.  Roth creates such perfect pieces of art!
B0000630BT|5.0|THE BAND: Rob Halford (vocals), K.K. Downing (guitar), Glenn Tipton (guitar), Ian Hill (bass), Scott Travis (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1990) 10 tracks clocking in at approximately 46 minutes. Included with the disc is a 10-page booklet containing song titles/credits, song lyrics and one black & white band photo. All songs written by Halford/Tipton/Downing. Remastered with bonus tracks and expanded liner notes in 2001 (55 total minutes). Recorded at Miraval Studios (Brignoles, France). Label - Columbia Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: \\"Painkiller\\" is an ultra large dose of traditional Judas Priest sounds with some speed & thrash metal mixed in. In other words... compared to their previous two albums, the metal messiahs have returned to form! Nothing can compare to the band's early releases (\\"Stained Glass\\" though \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\") in the late 1970's and early 80's... but \\"Painkiller\\" comes close. For me, \\"Turbo\\" (1986) and \\"Ram It Down\\" (1988) were way to pop, to tame, too much bubblegum - way to happy. \\"Painkiller\\" showed the band still had the balls to bang their heads the old school way. Looking back now, \\"Painkiller\\" is still a bittersweet album. Rob Halford would officially leave the band in 1991, and Judas Priest was pronounced dead from '91-95... only to resurge in '96 with replacement scab singer, Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens. To me, this was like David Lee Roth leaving Van Halen, or Bruce Dickinson leaving Iron Maiden... maintaining that ANY replacement would simply be unacceptable. Also note long time  drummer Dave Holland was out and new skin pounder Scott Travis (from Racer-X) was in - bringing extremely quick feet and lots of heavy double bass. This is an album filled with anger, attitude, shredding guitars, pounding drums, and happily very little keyboards (only on \\"A Touch Of Evil\\"). From the 6-minute opening title track to the album closer, \\"Painkiller\\" just doesn't let up - no filler to be found. Highlights include the title track, \\"Metal Meltdown\\", \\"Night Crawler\\" and \\"A Touch Of Evil\\" (as it happens, all 4 of these songs were featured on the band's 2-disc '93 compilation \\"Metal Works\\"). This may well be Judas Priest's heaviest album - as well as their last essential release (4.5 stars).ight Crawler\\" and \\"A Touch Of Evil\\" (as it happens, all 4 of these songs were featured on the band's 2-disc '93 compilation \\"Metal Works\\").

0385486804|5.0|I read this book for a book report I did several years ago. I still remember how great it was. An illuminating look into the wild, untamed, searching heart of a man. Very excellently written.
B000Q66H8C|5.0|If you think you had it rough back in your high school days, or you think things are bad in the public school system now...  you have to see this movie. *SPOILER ALERT*  *SPOILER ALERT*  Set in the near future in an economically depressed and overcrowded Japan, with juvenile deliquency run rampant, the government has come up with a solution similar to the \\"bread and circuses\\" one used in ancient Rome - give the public a distraction to keep their minds off their problems. The Romans used the gladitorial games. This particular Japanese government creates the \\"Battle Royale Act\\", setting forth a bizarre scenario where a particular high school class is chosen randomnly, unwittingly ambushed by knockout gas on a so-called \\"class trip\\", and transported to a remote island where thery're awakened and outfitted for the Battle Royale game - to be televised around the world. The object of the game is to survive. Each student is outfitted with some gear and a weapon, and are told that by the end of the allotted time period, only one will be left alive. No one can refuse, of attempt to leave the island because they're all outfitted with unremovable, explosive collars around their necks. The only other way off the island besides winning the game is suicide. This sets up the tension and suspense of the story - how will all these students deal with this sudden life or death struggle thrust upon them. Who will remain friends and who will become enemies? This superb, and extremely violent thriller, with thoughtfully placed moments of comic relief to cut the tension, makes for one of the most original and fascinating films I've seen in a long time. Personally, I would recommend this for only ages 18 and above.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This show is as good as TV gets.  Psychologically fascinating, as you find yourself sympathizing with and even liking this serial killer, while at the same time being repulsed by him. A window into the world of the true sociopath, who walks around acting \\"as if\\" he is normal.  Often he calls it wrong. He can't understand the value in relationships; it takes him a while to get the value of sex.  And the peek into his mind is well done.  Funny too; good dialogue, great acting. This is not a good guys and bad guys John Wayne style TV series.  Its power lies in the fact that as you develop sympathies and notions, your own viewpoints alarm you and create new questions. Dexter is not for everyone, as another reviewer said. It is for those who are willing to take a walk on the dark side of their own brains, and find out what lurks there. For a literary expansion on our misconceptions of 'character,' I'd suggest the book 'The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil' by Zimbardo.

B000OCXFCO|5.0|I've been with Dave and the Deth since Killing is My Business. I think I've burned through at least 5 or 6 of each of their albums in the days of cassette tapes and their 'life expectancy' - thank God for CD's!  <br /> <br />This album has been long awaited. It was a sad day for the metal world when Dave threatened retirement after The System Has Failed and his accident. My boys (ages 11 & 8) were devastated when they heard the Deth were disbanding. Upon hearing of the upcoming United Abominations and a release date, my kids have been counting the days. <br /> <br />We are all VERY impressed with this album! We've heard 'em all and agree that this one is an instant classic and by far one of their best to-date. I wasn't initially impressed with Dave's new line-up (I thought Glen Drover looked like a dweeb when he was on-stage), but the more I listen to Glen's shredding and solo's and how well he blends with Dave's unique style of playing, I must admit that I am impressed with the potential of this new line-up <br /> <br />And yes, you can believe the reviews that compare UA to Dave's more gritty-n-grindy good old days. This album just plain shreds! Dave's songwriting & fretboard magic are as good as ever. <br /> <br />NO METAL ALBUM WILL BE COMPLETE WITHOUT UNITED ABOMINATIONS!!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|the title sais it all! this has got to be one of the best dvd investments i have ever made! ever since i was little ive always loved animal shows and stuff like this, and this takes the cake! beautiful wonderful images of animals and nature! an incredible look into Gods wonderful creations! im a catholic/christian, and not too into nature shows that talk a whole lot about how this and that evolved from a monkey over trillions of years (steriotypically speaking), but these dvds dont do that much at all! these dvds are more about witnessing the beauty of the world we are so blessed to live in! some people have submitted reviews saying that its not David narrorating, that it is some actress, they must have recieved a different version, cause it is DAVID ATTENBOROUGH and it is WIDE SCREEN! My Fiance and I have already watched this whole series, and cant wait to watch them over and over, and one day to share the excitement these dvds bring with our future children! i knoe they will love it as much as we do!! also, when i got these dvds i got standard shipping, yet i recieved these dvds within a week of purchase!! i was so excited when i saw them in my mail box!!! a complete and wonderful surprise! these dvds are perfect, and will make a perfect gift for anyone you knoe that loves these kinds of shows, you wil not be dissapointed!!
141694740X|5.0|That could be another very good title for this book.  Although it's been out for a long time, I only just read this in its entirety recently.  Yes!  It is very good.  I didn't necessarily agree with the specific advise in each case.  What I did like was the refreshingly sound view that women shouldn't cater to men.  If he's not into you, move on.  There are plenty of guys, why spend so much time on one who is clearly not that interested?  This is in direct opposition to most chick lit.  Just look at the titles; lots involve words like 'Change him' or 'Make Him Marriable.'  Such awful advice.  This book has none of that, just a good theme that women should be willing to move on instead of appeasing, pining over, and trying to change a guy.  I also recommend the exceptional [[ASIN:0978797957 God Is a Woman: Dating Disasters]], which is more in-depth with real life stories and a precise POV from a guy.  I'm interested in seeing how both books compare to the highly anticipated [[ASIN:0307345696 The Manual: A True Bad Boy Explains How Men Think, Date, and Mate--and What Women Can Do to Come Out on Top]].  That book shows some promise.
B000654YS8|5.0|As an \\"On Again\\" fan of Dire Straits since \\"Brothers in Arms\\" this collection of videos is very well done and well worth the asking price. Sound and picture quality are very good and song selection is indicative of their collected body of works.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I probably have certain eccentricities that keep me from understanding some music and basically I wasn't much of a fan or a cult follower of this band.  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot left me puzzled at all the hoopla.  I complained about the filler and shortage of quality songs in A Ghost is Born (come on now, do you really still sit through the noise at the end? or agree it's a bit overindulgent?)and have always felt there was more hype than brilliance surrounding this band.<br /><br />It doesn't help probably that I think Jay Farrar's music is more consistently interesting.<br /><br />Not any more.  This is Tweedy's masterpiece.  Uncle Tupelo brought a success to both Tweedy and Farrar that neither could deal with if you look at the progression of their music.  They tinkered often pretentiously at times and more often than not came across as self-absorbed self-proclaimed geniuses these last ten years.  At least to me.<br /><br />Now they both seem comfortable with what they both are-Brilliant song writers.  I thought this on Farrar's The Search and now Sky Blue Sky is simply incredible.<br /><br />For the first time, it seems to me, Tweedy isn't hiding behind fame or troubles or artsy fartsy pretense.  He's focused on the song.<br /><br />And he's writing great songs filled with beatlesque flourishes and some simply incandescent guitar flashes that add touches to his music with so much more depth than the Arc Weld Neil Young flashes on A Ghost is Born.<br /><br />Lyrically, he's always shined and there are subtle lines in this one as great as any he's written.<br /><br />A ceiling fan is on<br /><br />Chopping up my dreams<br /><br />Tweedy has arrived and let's hope that cosmic bus station there at the end has an old buddy standing next to him as they talk about that final album they did together in Nashville.
B0000TLA9G|1.0|Inever received this item. No one from Amazon or the Post Office will help me locate it.
B00008D1NF|5.0|This is an astonishingly impressive CD of popular Brazilian music, so full of life and joy!  It's playful and uplifting while at the same time soulful and soothing.  It is also one of my all-time favorite CDs.  It is a one-time effort from 2003 of three friends and musical collaborators, Marisa Monte, Arnaldo Antunes and Carlinhos Brown. <br /> <br />Since a friend gave the CD to me a few weeks ago I find it impossible to stop listening to it (muchas gracias amigo mio).  After countless listens, I constantly hear new things.  It just draws you in, welcomes you to stay a while, to laugh and smile and to enjoy the moment.  Each song is an incredibly well crafted piece of art.   <br /> <br />The lyrics are pure evocative poetry and the beautiful acoustic arrangements (mainly piano and guitars) and vocal harmonies are so interesting.  Thankfully, both the original Portuguese lyrics and English translations are included in the liner notes.  And the singing in Portuguese is superb - the charming sounds of that language goes so well with the music.  Marisa Monte's gorgeous and soaring vocals lead on most cuts.  Arnaldo Antunes' deep voice grounds the songs with his warm and rich tones.  Carlinhos Brown's voice is pure magic, as is his unique and fun percussion.   <br /> <br />The songs are about love, life, friends and the best experiences of your life.  The Tribalistas music is evocative of poignant and wonderful experiences.  Whenever I listen to this CD I recall the best summer of my childhood - it just has that feeling.  You may find yourself floating back to your fascination with your first love.  Or maybe you'll remember that anticipation as a child of receiving presents on your birthday or Christmas.  Perhaps you will remember a great road trip with your best friends.  For me, this CD is the soundtrack for all those great experiences.   <br /> <br />Have a look at the some of the other rave reviews here and then buy this CD to hear for yourself!
B000K7VHPU|5.0|This is a good movie. We were so happy with the shipping time and the price.
0061142026|4.0|This was a fun, quick read with a pretty original story.  If he hadn't have put the sex scene and some of the gore in, though, it would have been a perfect YA book.  I'm not one to tell someone how to write, but between the stuff that made this book clearly an \\"adult\\" book, it read exactly like a young adult book.
B00003CWNR|5.0|This is a great movie. It was in perfect condition. Never used when we got it and it was a reasonable price. :)
B00005JPP6|5.0|I wish my review could do this movie justice, but I'm just so darn excited about how good this film is that I can't write coherently.<br /><br />Hot Fuzz is the best movie I have seen this year.<br /><br />The second-best movie was the other time I saw Hot Fuzz.<br /><br />Yes; I've seen it twice already, and it's so good might make it a third.  (As other reviewers have mentioned, there are lots of puns and such that you might miss the first time through.)<br /><br />If you are a fan of action flicks or buddy comedies you will like this movie.  Just like Shaun of the Dead spoofed zombie movies, Hot Fuzz spoofs the cop/buddy-flick action movie.<br /><br />From a technical side of things the sound design and editing are amazing.  The script and delivery of the lines are stellar.  The special effects are incredibly well done.  The choice of camera angles are genius at times.  Sometimes it's to pay homage to another movie, (that helicopter-over-the-head shot - Bad Boys, much?) other times it's their own creativity shining through.<br /><br />The team that brought you Shaun of the Dead proves that it was not a one-off fluke; they can make good films.  5 friggin' stars for genius and almost making me fall out of my chair from laughing.
B000O178BY|5.0|I've always loved Nine Inch Nails, but this is Trent Reznor truly matured as an artist.  The concept behind the album is consistent and conveyed very well--the bottom line is that the music is incredible.  Even if you only kind of like NIN a little bit, I highly recommend this to ANYONE.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Although this movie was made in 2002, it is a great action movie!
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Oh, the first part was funny alright, and in a different way than most movies even attempt to be. I think the second-hand mistranslations (both blatant and subtle) had me hooked from the get go. And the latter part of the movie is sad but very moving.  <br /> <br />I heard someone complain of the unlikelihood that Jonathan S. F. would run into the only tour guide with a similar history, but if you look at it from the point of view from the grandfather, a lifetime of giving \\"Heritage Tours\\" would probably yield at least one searcher from the same village. In real life, Jonathan Safran Foer wasn't able to find Augustine, which is really too bad. But I'm glad he made up a fictional story anyway, and this movie based on that story is really one of the most worthwhile movies I've ever seen.
B000N3AXQU|5.0|In Sylvester Stallone's latest and, potentially greatest, take on his seminal hero Rocky Balboa, the writer/director/actor scores big in the emotional clenches. These are the final moments of a great character so many people have come to know and love.<br /><br />When I heard about the film getting green-lit with Sylvester Stallone in the starring role, I have to own up to some skepticism. I really didn't think Stallone could pull it off. I thought maybe he wouldn't have the chops physically or possibly be too emotionally close to the character and the lucrative franchise it became to take enough risks with the character.<br /><br />Twenty minutes into the film, though, I was convinced that I was in for a comfortable, exciting, and emotional reunion and final meeting with a hero that's been in my life for thirty years. I saw Rocky when it came out. He and Burt Reynolds were the reasons I drove Trans Ams for ten years. Burt had Sally Field back then and jeans looked great on her, so maybe Burt had a little more influence.<br /><br />Rocky's personal life has always been a series of tragedies. He was a bum from nowhere who got a shot in Rocky. He almost lost the woman of his dreams in Rocky II. He lost his trainer, Mickey, who was like a father to him in Rocky III. He lost one of his greatest friends, Apollo Creed, in Rocky IV. And in Rocky V, he lost everything and got kicked to the curb back in his old neighborhood while getting betrayed by a young boxer he was trying to help.<br /><br />And in Rocky Balboa, he's lost Adrian. Knowing the character for as long as I did, I had to wonder what was left. His life appears comfortable, but it's empty. The tour he takes us on during those opening minutes of the film bear this out. His relationship with his son has gone south. More than anything, though, Rocky just doesn't know what to do with himself. When Adrian was alive, he could give up the fighting. He had her.

032147404X|5.0|This is a very good book I love the way Scott Kelby tells you how to do something. He explains it in very easy to understand text. and shows you a lot of pictures to explain what he is doing. I love all of his book even the one he wrote on the Ipod. I will always buy any of his books. Thanks again
B000GY729M|5.0|This is a great album that improves with every listen.  What a talented band!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I was scared to death to purchase this album because of all the bad hype it was getting. Mike wasn't rapping, Chester didn't use his vocals well enough, yadda, yadda, yadda. Then I heard the album and I was amazed and also glad that the album was not sounding the same as the other two. Don't get me wrong, Hybrid Theory and Meteora was two spectacular albums and was the best investment of those years, but with time and years comes growth. I'm glad they matured and showed another side to their talent. I'd almost be scared if they released the same sounding album. If they had sounded the same, that would be the end of their music because eventually their sound would become outdated and boring. <br /> <br />Wake: 10/10 I thought this was a great way to introduce the album. <br />Given Up: 10/10 <br />Leave Out all the Rest: 11/10 <br />Bleed it Out: 10/10 <br />Shadow of the Day: 10/10 <br />What I've Done: 15/10 Great first release <br />Hands Held High: 12/10 Anyone with a political sense of what is really going on in the world will appreciate the stance LP took on the issues. <br />No More Sorrow: 11/10 <br />Valentine's Day: 10/10 <br />In Between: 20/10 You better work it Mike!!!!!! One of my favorites. <br />In Pieces: 10/10 <br />The Little Things Give you Away: 20/10 Priceless tribute to the Hurricane Katrina disaster. The media may have forgotten those displaced by the hurricane, but that doesn't mean everyone has. <br /> <br />All in all this album was great and anyone with musical ears can hear that. I will now speak to those downloading the music rather than buying it. Take it from a girl who tried very hard to hear the album before the cd came out, the album is hard to get on the internet. What you're hearing is songs that are not of the album. If you are rating off the internet version that wasn't cross-checked with authentic samples from the album, you should remove your rating and buy the album and then rate the real material. I won't look down on you for downloading because I also tried to get the album that way to make sure it was worth buying, but don't rate unless you really know what the music sounds like. I can't wait until they release a reanimation 2 because we all know that there probably will be one and those who hate the album will come back and say \\"now I get the maturity and reasoning behind the album. Our ratings were stupid and ill-conceived!!\\"
0340839937|5.0|this is one of my all time favorite books.  i love post apocalyptic dystopian fiction, and though this is a universe only loosely connected to our own, the themes are painfully relevant.   <br /> <br />Herbert was a master, and it shows.  in this one book (the rest of the series drops off in quality), he creates an entire universe, complete with politics, religion, cultures, legends, heros and villians.  he constructs a world that is entirely foreign, yet strangely captivating, compelling and strikingly familiar in its humanity, and lack there of. <br /> <br />i frequently pick up used copies of this at garage sales and used book stores so i can pass them on to friends.  i can't stand the idea that there are people unfamiliar with this amazing tale.  don't be put off by the movies versions.  while the david lynch version captured the lusciousness of Herbert's world, he utterly lost the story.  the sci-fi channel version is true to the story, but with an austerity reflective of the planet dune, but not to this masterpiece of fiction.
B000OCZ0ZO|3.0|[...]<br />Where to start? Who knows. Suffice to say, this is what we should have all expected. A flawlessly produced and perfectly executed `pinnacle album'. It's everything that they advertised it to be: Deeper lyrics, clearer sound, new style, less electronic, and more rock-hop than ever.<br /><br />However, it's also more melodic, has less social anger and more insecure anger, and far less variety.<br /><br />And worst of all, it was formulaic; not only in the music itself, but the lyrics as well. I'm no fan of the Bush Empire, but it's just so COMMON for entertainers to bash him that it almost detracts from the music. 4 songs on one album addressing the same issue is too much, and it's annoying. Mike could have taken the same song (Hand's Held High) and picked some more poignant, less exploited subject matter to flow on, and instead of being political and redundant, he could have been an eye-opener and a voice for the voiceless.<br /><br />Well, regardless of my `feelings', this was still a good album, and worth purchasing, but I can only give it an honest 3.5 stars.<br /><br />Since this album took so much longer to produce than the first two, you can't really compare them directly on the music itself, but I am obligated to compare the emotional connection that I feel with each of them, and `Minutes to Midnight' only gives me an E.C. of 3.5 (on a scale of one to five), where as `Hybrid Theory' and `Meteora' both give me a 5.<br /><br />On a side note, I bought that RED album the home-skillet up top mentioned, and it was/is very good. If we could find a way to mash these two albums together, we'd all be in rock `n roll heaven.<br /><br />So My additional musical recommendation is this:<br /><br />Stage<br /><br />Get it. If you don't like it, I'll pay for it.<br /><br />By the way, WHAT HAPPENED TO MR. HAHN ?!?!?!?!?
0312360266|4.0|I mainly bought this book because I liked the cover, and after I got past the beginning it was worth it.  <br /> <br />The variation to the stereotypical vampyre was interesting and the main reason I enjoyed it, along with the bits of Native American culture.  However the family drama seemed fake and the early dialouge was unnatural.  Also the author[s] didn't pay much attention to their descriptions - one character changed from having perfect red hair [there was a whole paragraph about it] to deep black.  The amount of vampyres that existed was slightly annoying since it seemed that practically every celeb. was a vampyre, yet the humans were prejudiced against vampyres.  it would have helped if there were fewer famous vampyres or if the humans were more reverent towards them. <br /> <br />Even though at times it seemed to be more about wiccans instead of vampyres, the concept was interesting and I'm definetely going to read the next book to see where it goes.
B00005M989|5.0|Classic 80's rock with all our favorite songs.  Excellent condition.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Ok .... trust me .. to make the 'nutter' royal family seem even slightly interesting or symapthetic is a a challenge to say the least....      I KNOW that when Diana died the COLD BLOODED SHREW of a Queen was upset at her vacation  being interrupted with the funeral arrangements that nothing but homosexuals and glitterati would attend, Elton John was mentioned, not a single tear was shed. Matter of fact the movie portrays that Queen Elizabeth was more dismayed at a 14 point stag being killed on her Balmoral estate by a commercial 'stock broker' hunter, than the violent death of her ex-daughter-in-law!       Matter of fact this COLD BLOODED SHREW of a Queen, I know I should let you know how I really feel, could not shed a singe tear for Diana she was practically catatonic and weeping like Niagara when the British Navy retired her damned royal yacht the 'Brittanica' ... I saw it in the flesh!      Helen Mirren portrayed Queen Liz ... well fabulous is an understatement! She did deserve and academy award...      Now the twofer was Micheal Sheen .... no no not one of the US Sheen family ... google it OK ... who played Tony Blair. Most certainly along with Mirren he is central in this movie and should also have won Academy accolades. Micheal Sheen won awards for the London stage play 'Amadeus' and has appeared in an ecclectic group of flicks such as 'The Four Feathers', 'The Kingdom of Heaven', and 'Blood Diamond'.     Nuff said .. it's a twofer !!!!
006085880X|5.0|Picoult has become one of my favorite writers, one of a few that can keep me up all night turning the pages.  This is undoubtly the best of all her books.  The pact is sad, telling, and poignant.  A must read.
B000BRBA8S|1.0|Why is it the greatest part of many films are the previews. If this director and screenwriter woiuld have spent as much time on the move as they did on the preview this may have been an interesting film. <br /> <br /> <br />Unless I guess you keep a bong very nearby while watching this film I will guarantee that the viewer will have absolutely NO idea as to what is going on at any one point in time. The film most certainly is very Oriental with the dark and brooding images, the compulsory 'player type' bad boy and of course we need the chain smoking super sexy bright lipstick female lead.  <br /> <br /> <br />To say that I was disappointed with the lack of substance would be an understatement!
0316287059|5.0|Perhaps a little bit more for the advanced make up artist, I was amazed by the way that such changes were created.. I wish only that Kevyn was alive and had a school where you could learn some of his techniques. He was amazing. A good book to have.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Some of the rough edges of the first 2 albums were covered by an emotion that represented real expression.  This album lacks both.  Essentially, they have released a compilation of emotionless, \\"power\\" ballads.  The angst has been replaced by the awkard insertion of cursing and prolonged single scream in each song.  If I wanted to hear Sublime, I'd buy their album.
0316286850|4.0|Being a makeup artist who tries to learn new methods for applying makeup, I enjoyed reading this book. I bought in fact two of Kevyn's books. I also had Bobbi's book and some other books, where they merely advertise their own products and tell you things that are known and basic. Kevyn's book had actual techniques and a variety of looks. Sometimes I think that the way an artist creates a look cannot really be explained, you have to be next to him when he is actually applying the makeup.. putting it in words and pictures is not always easy to do. Kevyn Aucoin is a pleasure to read and he is not only humble but definitely a great artist. I was saddened to read that he is no longer with us.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Of course there were allot of people holding there breath before this CD was released praying that it would live up to there expectations.... at least I was! At first I did not know what to expect after reading all these amazon Troll's bashing this CD before it was even released. I was concerned that I was in for some serious disappointment. After listening to this CD many times over this last week I am convinced this is there logical progression as musicians. Most people are complaining that there is no presence of Mike Shinoda... well if you actually listen to the CD you would hear that he does a lot more vocals than he has ever done. Again, people may hate this, but I love it! Fort Minor I think was Mike's outlet for rapping, rather than fashion an LP album that sounded just like Fort Minor, I think they did an unbelievable job at distinguishing themselves. I think any LP fan with some musical sense will really love this album. People who really love music will love this album. As far as I am concerned, all of the negative reviews really is a statement of how ignorant you are to true musical genius! I cannot wait to see them on tour this summer!
1582701709|1.0|Now that Ms Byrne has revealed the secret of the law of attraction, I hope that she plans to travel to Africa where she can help those poor people in Darfur to stop attracting genocide and others from attracting the AIDS epidemic.  Apparently Hitler was a master of The Secret, but pity all those Jews in the Holocaust for misaligning the universe against themselves. . . This book is hogwash!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This album for me just further proves what an awesome band LP is. The change is not drastic but definitely different, you can still tell that LP was totally behind this cd. The lyrics and the vocals are amazing.  They all took such a big part in the making of this album that makes it even more awesome. All these other \\"fans\\" that are stating it is not them, and how the album sounds like an alternative pop album like all the rest have really no clue what LP is all about and why they made the change they did.
1582701709|3.0|The book was easy to read, and overall, worth reading.  The concept is very interesting and I believe, could certainly change your life.  <br />I was distracted ocassionally by the drawings that appeared before each contributor's entries.  It slowed down the pace of the book. <br /> <br />While I liked the concept, I would have preferred more proof, especially since they claim that for thousands of years people have known and lived the secret, yet we only hear from a handful of them.  No cites, no context, just 'trust us, people have been using it.'  In addition, I was CRAVING some practical exercises that I could use to really implement this concept and make it a daily part of my life.  I was really wishing for some more examples. <br /> <br />In any event, it's a good, easy interesting read.  Great for the beach or a chapter or two before bed.  Overall, I would recommend it.
B000002J0B|5.0|For some reason it took me 30-years to buy this c-d. iv'e been a huge zep fan since there first album, released in 1969! what a joy this c-d is. like i said in the title you know every song! every song on this c-d is played on classic radio every day! in fact i would recommend this c-d to someone who wasn;t that familiar with there music. hard rock, blues ,acoustic, really covers all the styles they do best! not a bad song on the whole c-d! highly recommended!!!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|First of all, I am a country music fan, and I am a linkin park fan and always will be. linkin park are one of the only \\"rock\\" bands I listen to that I consider very good. This album is a great album. I will admit its not as good as there first 2 but its still linkin park. Most of the songs are really cool and well written. just be open minded and enjoy the music
B0009R1T7M|4.0|No matter how dark his subject matter (serial killers, assassinated presidents, etc.), Sufjan Stevens' bouyant melodies and soundscapes carry the listener happily along.  I have my issues with the album (hence the 4 stars): he seems to take himself too seriously, the choruses can sound a little too much like Polyphonic Spree, and so many musical interludes begin to feel like filler.  However, the whimsical tone does not undermine his literate lyrics and the tunes are so catchy and memorable that my 6 year-old daughter can often be heard singing \\"Chicago\\".
B00005JKNF|5.0|If you want to spend a rainy evening at a stately English estate guessing whodunit?, this classic Altman film is for you.  Star-studded cast in a complex, intertwined storyline with great plot twists and period details to perfection.  Definitely worth the purchase.  You'll watch it over and over just to decipher all the witty British dialogue.
B000HIVO64|4.0|As much as I have enjoyed Beck's reinventions over the years, this album was refreshing.
0743454537|4.0|This is the first novel that I have read from Picoult.  I instantly fell for her writing style, how she puts you in each character's shoes so that the story is anything but one-sided.  Intense story line, whether you have a sibling or not this book will affect you.  The metaphors are abundant and fabulous, the beginning of each chapter starts with a excerpt from various sources, poems, books, etc., and each are wonderful and very applicable to the section of Picoult's novel that follows.  The story has many surprises and twists and turns, even in the last 13 pages she succeeded in throwing me for a very large loop.  I didn't want this one to end, and yet sadly it had to.
B000K4WPCC|3.0|Other people have mentioned about the movie's story etc. therefore I will skip that part. People generally look to this section to get a sort of \\"peer recommendation\\" so lets move quickly to that. This movie is worth:   4 star if your are a MALE TEENAGER interested in SUPERNATURAL/SUPERPOWER movies. You will love this movie if you already love SMALLVILLE serial.  2-3 star if you are a FEMALE TEENAGER interested in watching some COOL BOYS but let me warn you you might get quickly bored...  3 star if you are a movie-goer interested in SUPERNATURAL/SUPERPOWER stuff, it will give you some apetite about what you are looking for but it is not going to satisfy you, for sure...  2-3 star if you are into ADVENTURE MOVIES, probably you might find better movies that you still have not seen...  0-1 star if you are none of the above.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|Really isn't all that fantastic of an album. It's just more pop-metal nastiness mostly. Vocals are nasily, yes I know he got surgery, but that doesn't mean the whole band has to change. The guitar work wasn't all the impressive either, let alone the drumming. You want metal? (Though Avenged Sevenfold is hardly metal)Listen to Mastodon or Lamb of God. Much more worth it, those are some boys with talent. Cheers!
B0009A40ES|5.0|instead of writing a movie review, I'm going to review this product. Great quality picture and sound, commentary, dated previews- all pretty standard for a DVD these days. Great movie, good features- a great buy.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Another delicious bit of metal sustenance for you to enjoy. No two Lamb of God albums are alike, they all have its own brutal voice. If this doesn't \\"light the match, and spark the fire\\" in your metal loving soul, you are broken and need to move on. Buy it... totally worth it. Cheers!
0553213105|5.0|It took some adjusting to get used to the 19th Century writing style - authors were much more subtle then (and there were different societal norms).  Once I did, I was richly rewarded with this tale of mistaken intentions.  For those of you on the edge, take the time to appreciate the style, you wont regret it.
B000NA28IE|5.0|\\"Eragon\\" is one of the most recent entries in the currently booming field of high-caliber fantasy epics, a theme of moviemaking that until fairly recently had to rely on a very infrequent rate of new live-action films (but has had a slew of great anime titles under its banner for years and years).  A dragon-lover's dream film, \\"Eragon\\" takes place in a vast mythical land once protected by heroic pairs of dragons and dragonriders.  Within the lifetimes of some of the characters, that status quo was destroyed as a rogue dragonrider, Galbatorix (John Malkovich) recruited sorcerors and an army to destroy the dragons and install himself as absolute ruler.  The focus of the movie is the new turning point, where the first new dragon to be born in years, hatches and chooses a rider for itself, a young farmhand named Eragon (Edward Speelers).  Mentored by a veteran of the old war, Brom (Jeremy Irons), Eragon and the dragon Saphira embark on a quest to find and join one of the last pockets of resistance against Galbatorix. <br /> <br />   This has got everything you want in a fantasy movie - likable heroes, a courageous and gorgeous princess (Ayra, played by Sienna Guillory), awesome creatures, an engaging story, breath-taking action, dashes of appropriate humor, fantastic visuals (both with the special effects and the natural lands the show takes place in) and a richly realized world that feels real.  A lot has been made of similarities between \\"Eragon\\" and movies like \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Lord Of The Rings\\".  It's true that there are similarities, but it isn't a clone of a previous movie.  In any given summer, there are probably close to a dozen conventional action movies that have more in common with each other (and some of these are really good movies; I'm not saying they all stink) than \\"Eragon\\" does to its like-themed movies.  I guess to a lot of viewers the similarities between fantastic elements like dragons and sorcery stand out more than similarities between things like car chases that end with both cars crashing and the chase continuing on foot, climatic gun battles, cop partners who hate each other at first but end up best friends, and nearly identical cocaine-smuggling scenarios.  I think it's a shame that \\"Eragon\\" gets judged so harshly for having points-in-common with \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" and all, when all it's done is use some classic elements to build a new, and totally invigorating movie.  This is the kind of movie I wouldn't mind seeing more of, and it's without question a top pick for fantasy and adventure lovers.  10/10
0099410672|5.0|What an amazing, wide ranging story.  Obviously well researched, well planned out and deep.  The only problem is...there's no volume 2.  I've been waiting since May 1999 to see how the story ends and so far - no joy.  Pick it up, but be warned, you'll be left hanging.
1400064287|5.0|I picked up the book from the library, and immediately realized I needed to add it to my permanent collection. In just the first couple chapters, I had ideas that helped me pitch my business to investors better. <br /> <br />Chip and Dan did a great job in not only clarifying HOW to create sticky ideas, but also made it fun along the way. I laughed out loud several times, and appreciate their well-written approach to an often confusing and extremely important subject. <br /> <br />I am a professional communicator, and I am glad I found this book. I intend to utilitze the results for more effective communication in many aspects of life. I'm now thinking of ways to help my kids understand what I'm talking about...
0553382179|2.0|I wasted my money ! There are no secrets uncovered in this book-just some plain COMMON SENSE !  You can save 10 $ if you just remember to clean you house daily ( just break it up in little areas do not try to clean it all at once), and frequently decluttering by donating stuff to SALVATION ARMY or tossing it out. That's it !!! Just admit it, most people know what needs to be done, and don't need books with different gimmicks promising miracles to help them. However, it seems that I am in the minority regarding this book. It seems that FLYLADY has almost cult like following. I can't believe some people spend this much time writing long  accolades/comments . I guess this book is helpful to many women. Unfortunately, I am not one of them. Certainly, I do not want to stand in the way of anybody that can benefit from this book and having their life changed( insert eye roll). Anyway, before purchasing -check out the website to get a better idea about her philosophy.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Another out-of-the-park killer album from Michael Buble!  A few tasty original numbers, including the warm and fizzy Everything, round out this collection of sensational American standards, including The Best Is Yet To Come and That's Life, all sung with that effervescent snazziness we have come to love from this young Canadian vocalist.  I wish we didn't have to wait so long between albums!
B000OCXMAE|1.0|And they did it with Rick Rubin. For some reason the guys in the band thought they were NU METAL and actually said they \\"created that genre\\" and wanted to stay far away from it.. Obviously their delusional and aren't even close to NU METAL because KORN created that genre.. Anyways track by track shows immaturity and obvious theft of other artists writings.. Specificly U2 \\"With Or Without You\\" and \\"Shadow Of The Day\\". These guys need to regroup and stop jumping the gun and write some good songs and feel good doing it. Dont worry about what people think. Take a year off and write this CD off as a learning moment. Let's a see a double album next time and stop ripping your fans off.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This is a totally fun and scary series. Combine eerie demons, vampires, and many other monsters with sarcastic wit and charm and you have a combination for success. Its a funny/sarcastic PG-13 Scooby-Doo with a twist. I would recommend this series to anyone!
B000EGCITG|5.0|THIS CD IS HER BEST YET!!  A FEW TO MANY SLOW SONGS, BUT THE ROCK SONGS TOTALLY KICK A**!!!
1582701709|1.0|The teachings presented in this book amount to the teachings of sorcery. In occult magic, the idea is that you can bring what is existent on another plane of reality into the material plane. There is nothing new in this book. In fact, the reader will notice that many New Thought leaders are quoted. In fact, Byrne admits this all got started when she read a book by Wallace Wattles published in 1910. Wattles was a New Thought teacher. New Thought, a movement that started in the 1800's, was itself based on teachings that parallel occult teachings. The basic teaching of New Thought is to visualize and affirm what you want, and you will attract it. This kind of thinking is part of the occult. I learned these techniques back in the 70's and 80's when I was involved in New Age/occult teachings. The book even tells the reader she/he has the powers of God.<br /><br />Jesus is misrepresented and quoted unashamedly out of context in this book. When Jesus talked about asking and believing, it was in the context of prayer, not as a technique to get what you want. The prayer Jesus taught included submission to God's will (\\"Thy will be done\\"). Also, the book does not seem to know the Bible well at all - \\"the Kingdom is within you\\" quote is actually rendered \\"The Kingdom is among you\\" and was said by Jesus to the Pharisees as a rebuke because they were not recognizing him as the Messiah. Context counts!<br /><br />Even if one thinks these techniques work, that does not mean they are ethical or good. What works or seems to work in the spiritual realm is not always from God. In the long run, engaging in such techniques will only be spiritually destructive.
0596101996|4.0|The information in the book is absolutely solid, but WOW is the information mundanefully unappealing. There was ZERO thought into keeping the reader interested with content layout, bordering, graphic design, illustration, examples, etc. It is a good resource to have handy. I hate to be the superficial simpleton in the bunch but I'm rather BIG on ascetically appealing text... (it helps with my acute A.D.D. ... j/k ;) this is not that. It's like reading the paper version (vs. online version) of the wall street journal... dampened by the rain and chewed up by the neighbors chihuahua. For those like me try, 1. \\"JavaScript in easy steps\\" 2.\\"JavaScript for the world wide web\\" and 3.\\"Pro JavaScript Techniques\\"... in that order.
B00000K3D4|5.0|As old as this movie is, kids today still love it. I bought it at the request of a 13 year old and she says it is her favorite. I guess getting it right is timeless.
B000ENC6XM|4.0|Overall, this is a good movie.  The story is very good, and very tongue and cheek with views and belief.  As for the HD version, GREAT, and has tons of Supplements/Extra/Features, it was definitely worth with the \\"IN-Depth\\" that comes with the movie! I'm happy to say that \\"IF\\" you like this movie, then buy the HD version of it, I wasn't a fan of this Movie, but I bought it because i knew the HD would be awesome, and it didn't disappoint me, and then for some reason, I was watching the movie, and I was like, \\"Wow, this is a pretty good movie.\\"  Again, Mr. Reeves, isn't the best actor, BUT he did OK, enough to not ruin the movie.  This is a great movie!  I would recommend atleast checking it out! :) Awesome picture!
B00005JKL8|1.0|I am shocked at the star rating given to this movie. It seems most viewers based their recommendation soley on action (which wasn't great) and not a bit of facts (in which this movie was sorely lacking). <br /> <br />I spent two years as an aid worker in the Balkans after the Bosnian war and the NATO siege of Serbia and Kosovo. I went to see this film expecting to get at least a shred of credibility. I should have known better. What I saw, to my extreme disapointment, was the usual Hollywood pander, presenting a fictionalized account of true events as recycled media fare: the Serbs were the only bad guys, everyone else was victimized, no other ethnic group committed any war crimes. Rubbish! I worked with hundreds of Serbs were innocent victims in this tragic civil war. Outside the town where I worked in Bosnia, there was a \\"concentration camp\\" where Croats jailed other Croats who refused to fight against the Muslims! Does that say anything about the insanity of this war? For Hollywood to present such a stereotypical, one-sided aspect of the situation is irresponsible and poor judgement-- for some people, this may be one of the only movies they about the Bosnian war, and they will walk away thinking they know the whole story.  <br /> <br />If you want to see an outstanding war movie as well as a more accurate representation of what happend in Bosnia, check out the movie \\"Savior\\" with Dennis Quaid. At least they try to present all sides of the story, rather than doing a gross injustice to a complex war as in \\"Behind Enemy Lines.\\"
0441009425|4.0|This is Reynolds' first book and as such, its obvious he spent a lot of time on it, carefully balancing the story, the characters, the setting and so forth.  The universe he's created is simply superb and is the setting for several of his future books.  The writing is crisp and the anti-heroes as main characters are really a lot of fun (and I'm not really an anti-hero fan).<br /><br />A couple of minor drawbacks:<br /><br />1. 99% of the time, the pacing is fantastic - makes it hard to put down the book...except the last 30 or 40 pages; we shift from quick rapid sequences of one set of characters to long, drawn out descriptions following another set.  It detracts from the \\"finish strong\\" philosophy.<br /><br />2. Some of the secondary characters were a bit flat - in fact, for one of them, the wife of one of the protagonists, there needed to be a bit more reasoning as to WHY she actually loved this guy.<br /><br />That said, the cyborg ship with its...crew / passengers...was simply wonderful; very original and certainly a lot of fun to read.<br /><br />This belongs on any sci-fi reader's bookshelf.<br /><br />J.

0375505091|5.0|I opened this book with anticipation.  I washed my hands so I would not mar or fingerprint the photos.  And I removed the dust jacket to keep it nice.  Annie Leibovitz' artistry compels me to treat her artworks with respect and care.  I appreciated the book's large size, because I love large, beautiful images.<br /><br />Some people probably think portrait photographer's are gifted because they know how to stage a great photo.  That is probably true.  But I think the less often recognized talent is seeing who people become in the presence of a portraiture artist.  When people are in Annie Leibovitz' presence, I think they may ask themselves:  What images do I want to define me?  What images do I want to represent me for a long time?  Around Leibovitz, her subjects become regal, considered, relaxed, and sincere.  Sure, the comedians are still cheesing it up for the camera sometimes.  But most of her subjects realize this may be one of the few times an image will be created that may portray them in a substantive and enduring light.<br /><br />In the introduction, Leibovitz' notes \\"But after Susan died, . . .\\"  And when I read those words, the above thought formed in my head.  Leibovitz' subjects realize her photos may be a dominant defining, popularly-known image of them after they are dead.  So I think her subjects make extra effort to become something larger than 'everyday' in her presence.<br /><br />I don't like to make criticisms in my reviews, and I tend to only review artworks I recommend.  But it takes more than great photographs to make a great photography book.  I was frustrated with the number of photographs that were enlarged across the book gutter, breaking up the photos' flows.  Bigger is not always better and many of the photos would have been better as smaller images on one page.  Alternatively, produce the book in two volumes, one volume in portrait, the second volume in landscape.  If we're going to put down $75 for one large book, then we probably would be willing to put down $50 twice for two better shaped volumes that adapted to the needs of the photographs.<br /><br />Some artists can find great art and photograph it professionally.  Some artists can re-interpret or choose a point of view that makes their photograph of something otherwise unremarkable into something artful.  And some artists seem to have the effect of making the people, social moods, and environments around them more artfully active and aware.  Leibovitz' photos reveal that she does all three of those things well.<br /><br />The more sensient her subject matter, the better her photography.  She draws out great intelligence and creativity from the people she is interacting with.  Her photos show not only her subjects' uncommonly revealed personas, but also her encouraging, emboldending, and enlightening effects on the people in her presence.  Leibovitz' artistry suggests to portraitists that if you want your subject to reveal uncommon beauty in your image of them, first create an atmosphere where they are want to reveal the same to you.put down $50 twice for two better shaped volumes that adapted to the needs of the photographs.

B0002ZMJ5M|4.0|I've been a Tull fan since the early 1970's.  During that decade I saw the band in concert 3 times.  Although Ian doesn't have the power/range in his vocals anymore - the music is still quite refreshing.  I like the spin on the old seasonal standards and wit and charm of his own material. <br />The pure instumentals are still way up to my Tull standards.  There's a lot of music and it's very enjoyable.  This one will be on my regular play list during the holidays - or whenever!
B000KC86F4|4.0|[[ASIN:B000KC86F4 X-Men 3 - The Last Stand [Blu-ray]]] Say what you will of this movie's plot, direction, etc. This movie is a must have in that ever growing collection of Blu-Ray Films! It'll bring out that true quality we expect from our entertainment systems. Great piece to show what HD's all about!

B000JVT09C|5.0|[[ASIN:B000JVT09C Superman Returns [Blu-ray]]]Put it this way, this film is so good and so entertaining (Hey its my little review!)that purchasing on dvd wasn't enough. It absolutely shines in High Definition, from the crisp visuals and audio,(of course it really depends on your entertainment setup) you will not be dissapointed.
6305127697|5.0|I just recently seen this movie and I was completely blown away, specifically by Edward Norton's performance. It doesn't seem to matter what movie he is in, he always delivers. This being his film debut makes it even more impressive and it took what could've an ordinary movie to extraordinary. I think without his performance, this movie would be long forgotten. That's not to say that rest of the cast didn't do well, Richard Gere is someone I typically don't like, but in this movie I think he did well.
B000FJGWBM|5.0|[[ASIN:B000FJGWBM Memento (Blu-Ray)]]Memento's been out for a while, but for newcomers and especially on blu-ray it warrants itself the purchase. The storytelling is being presented to us in Reverse-Chronological order, the way it spills its plot and the story's characters scene by scene is an achievement in movie making which is an amazing thrill to enjoy watching this film!  MUST BUY!!
B000MTOKXW|5.0|First off, my Five Stars are for the music only. The highly touted reproduction of the album art here is practically actual size on my computer as shown on Amazon. That said, if it's a fresh, beautiful reproduction of the William S. Harvey album art you want, don't buy this one because you won't be able to even read his name it's so tiny. For the art, I recommend the gorgeous Sundazed VINYL re-release. It actually IS LP sized because it's actually an LP! I love vinyl and it's great to have if you only have a CD version right now. In my opinion, \\"Forever Changes\\" is the single greatest rock album ever recorded. So far I've bought this album SIX times since I discovered it in 1983. First as a vinyl reissue, then another copy soon after because I was wearing out the first one. A third time once I found a collectable mint condition 1967 original issue with the Elektra and Love logos. Then a fourth time when finally released on CD. A fifth time when released in its entirety as part of the \\"Love Story\\" 2 disc compilation and a SIXTH time when the single CD was re-released in 2001 with bonus tracks. All money gladly spent mind you, but here's where I draw the line! There's NO REASON to buy this for the sake of the \\"faithful, loving reproduction\\" of the original album art. IT'S CD SIZED, PEOPLE! Might as well be a postage stamp. I can only read the song titles and credits on the back because I know them by heart! A magnifying glass should come as standard issue. So buy the Sundazed vinyl version for the art, but for the music pick up the WEA 2001 release with the bonus tracks which actually contains song titles & album credits that are easier to read than this \\"new\\" version they put out mostly for the sake of the \\"packaging\\". The 2001 version contains the normal jewel case setup with identical cover art that is itself slid into a sleeve that ALSO has the art front and back. It even has the old style Elektra and Love logos printed on the disc. This latest 2007 version is a waste of money even for a fanatics fanatic such as myself! If you do buy it, make sure to peel off all those stickers teling you what a wonderful, loving reproduction they've produced with the art! It's funny to think now that I bought that second copy because I was afraid that it may go out of print forever.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|Children Of Men is the kind of movie you either love or hate. When Vendetta came out, critics stomped it with criticism; they said the film had a shoddy conclusion and the decisions made by the protagonist were bought under scrutiny. There is no such protagonist in Children Of Men yet it is similar. Britain is a power in this movie again but then one might ask, what's the use when there is such a sense of uneasiness going on - around the world? Clive Own earns a lot of respect. His act is solid. There is no doubt that the action scenes in this film will make you wonder what hit you. To some, this film might appear  a bit \\"over the top\\" and to some, it might make perfectly skewed sense. CHILDREN OF MEN has a scene that stops your breath and makes your eyes go wide when your mind is telling you, \\"That's impossible\\" but yes, that where it sets itself apart.<br /><br />The best scenes in the film involves cars,on foot chases, men on the verge of insanity and utter dismay at one's helplessness. The direction tells us that power is ultimately sought. While Vendetta was based on a totalitarian form of government, Children Of Men takes a more conservative yet forward approach. Countries are fighting among themselves wondering why a woman can't give birth anymore. The storyline is good but the action and overall impact is quite staggering,really. The music of the film is worth remembering though not all tracks are found in the soundtrack. Why 4 stars, you might ask. I thought the film could have been longer (perhaps the editing could have been more generous) and I had difficulty understanding what was being said by a few characters.<br /><br />This is as good as Vendetta was, in my opinion, if not better. In ways best left home, it is also better than Vendetta whilst being a tad similar to 28 days later form of \\"run for your life\\"<br /><br />Give this film a chance, it will definitely leave an impact.
B000058983|5.0|Greatest Album Ever! There's so many versions available these days though, I thought I'd chime in and recommend this one for the music. The sound is a great improvement over the first single CD release AND there's bonus tracks. Don't fall for the more recent 2007 release. No extra tracks and the print is so small you won't be able to read who did what witout a magnifying glass. If you've never bought this album, I suggest buying this CD version along with the Sundazed vinyl release. Sundazed puts out a killer re-issue with excellent art reproduction and quality vinyl. It's actally fun to play the vinyl and CD at the same time and switch back and forth to see if there's any difference. CDs are so intrenched in todays culture that people forget that a clean vinyl copy on a good turntable sounds just as good, and sometimes better. All this talk bout digital this and digital that also makes folks forget that speakers as well as human ears are, and always will be, analog!
B000N3SRRC|4.0|very nice piece of work for the Maryland boys.  They always put a smile on my face, and they didnt let me down with this new release.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I was born after the Apollo missions were a thing of the past, so I have no personal recollection of any of the events depicted in \\"From the Earth to the Moon.\\"  And I have never been particularly fascinated with space, never one to say as a kid that I wanted to be an astronaut when I was older.  I thought \\"Apollo 13\\" was a solid film.  I say all of this to provide the context to suggest that I was not naturally predisposed to love this miniseries. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, I found \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" to be utterly fascinating, a remarkable piece of filmmaking.  It helps that it covers a piece of history that is full of great stories.  I was in awe of the size of the task that lay before all those involved in the Apollo missions and the synergy of a million little decisions and inventions and steps and tasks that needed to come together to make Apollo 11 possible.  Thankfully, it didn't appear that the filmmakers felt inclined to exaggerate the stories.  Instead, they allowed the power of that slice of history to stand on its own. <br /> <br />Another strength of this miniseries was the technique of having different directors for each episode.  This allowed each episode to have its own feel, its own flavor.  This variety was refreshing and never allowed the nearly 12 hours of film to become stale.  Of course, there were a few episodes that I found to be less appealing, as one would expect from so many different approaches, but the diversity of storytelling techniques made a few personal dislikes to be worthwhile. <br /> <br />A final major strength was the fact that each episode focused on a different set of people in the whole scheme of things.  One episode focused on the media.  One episode focused on the wives of the astronauts.  One episode focused on the company contracted to build the lunar module for the Apollo missions.  One episode focused on the scientists within NASA who battled amongst each other on such things as the location of the next landing site.  One episode focused on the relationships between the three astronauts assigned to a particular mission.  Again, this varied focus provided each episode with a unique perspective and shed new light on the events. <br /> <br />My only complaint, and this is minor, is that the extras were very underwhelming.  One \\"making of\\" documentary was interesting, but the rest of the extras were rather forgettable.  I suppose that this was produced on the front end of the extras phenomenon, but I would have liked to have seen more interviews, unused footage, and maybe even some bloopers. <br /> <br />Overall, I would rank \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" among the finest pieces of filmmaking that I've ever seen.  The acting was fantastic, and all of the production values were top-notch.  I was utterly captivated and wish that the series had continued into Skylab, the shuttles, and beyond!!
B00005UK1F|5.0|'Light of Day, Day of Darkness' is a complete album in every possible way: Not only is the album one continuous song; it is one whole composition, fitted together with all the necessary components that make for a complete masterpiece!!!<br />The epic nature of this song is really hard to describe in words. Although I have listened to it multiple times in its entirety I am always amazed by its brilliance. The band utilizes a full orchestra with their powerful riffs to create climactic build-ups within the composition. The intensity of these developments sometimes lead straight into another guitar sequence of even more epic proportions. The male vocals on this composition are perfectly suited to the mood and flow of the piece, sung mostly in a baritone type range, with some operatic sections and minimal yelling. The female chanting/singing in the middle section of the song is wonderfully appropriate followed by a lengthy guitar solo that is completely euphoric.<br />The tones used for many of the riffs are a high-pitched metallic sound that immediately result in serious head-banging. The great thing about this piece is how some of the riffs are recurring throughout while also incorporating newer soundscapes into the composition as it unfolds, thus creating a complete song - unlike other bands who seem to combine multiple songs into one just for the sake of creating a single song.<br />No amount of words can ever do this album justice - it quickly became one of my favorite albums ever upon hearing it a few times through. If you like epic progressive metal this is a must have!<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION: If you want to hear other metal of epic and progressive nature then check out Aghora's album 'Formless'. The riffage will not disappoint you!
B000MV9026|4.0|this movie had a great message and it was funny with all the dancing and singing that they do. great for the children.
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|How ironic that you asked for a review today.  Having owned the dvd for 1 month, I finally got a chance to watch the first half of it just last night.  It rocks. I saw the movie in a theatre when it came out and I was expecting it to be just okay (a la Mad Dogs and Englishmen, which does not live up to the memories I had of it for 30 years).  This, however, is really good stuff.  I'm only half way through, but so far have been blown away by the Billy Preston and Leon Russell songs in particular.  The Indian music section is also excellent, and George is very strong, singing and playing well while balancing the duties of musical director.   Unfortunately, EC is in noticeably mediocre form, playing sloppily and sometimes out of key.  (What a great ad for the Crossroads Clinic!  Thank God he made it through.)  Anyway, buy this DVD.  It's great.  Camera work, sound, and performaces are all good.  While you're at it, get the Concert for George, too.  That has a wonderful inventory of GH's songwriting, with excellent performances by EC as a bonus.

0679805273|5.0|This is Dr. Seuss. What more do you need to hear? It's true Seuss wit at his finest. This is such a great little gift for the graduate, for the \\"out-starting upstarts\\" of any age! It is written about real life and in the way that only Seuss can portray.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|dont waste your time.. i can listen to hybrid theory and meteora all day. I cant even get passed 5 songs without having to change the CD. Terrible.. just terrible.. mr. hahn and mike shinoda aren't even present... Almost seems like when they had the interview with them on MTV the other day. Just Chesters and Phoenix's ideas as they were saying what they wanted to express.. They pretty much sold out to the likes of Rick Rubin who totally messed up this cd and added his political thoughts just like in American Idiot cd. Rick Rubin is a turd.. this is not linkin park.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|WARNING: this album may take multiple listens from all of you, do not be too harsh on the first impression.      My first listen through I was pumped!!  Sleepwalker(9/10) was fast and heavy, a great chunky chugging tone with evil words.      Washington is Next (9.5/10) blew my mind when I heard it on the album for the first time;  heavy fast drums with awesome double bass drumming.  but after that i felt dissappointed...    5 listens through the album later     Never Walk Alone(8.5/10).   awesome verses, heavy fast riffs, really kool instrumental part, innovative for Megadeth... corny chorus...  but still awesome    United Abominations:(10/10)  first listen I hated it, now it is my favorite song on the album PERIOD.  The verse riff is REALLY HEAVY  I did not expect that sort of heavy out of megadeth.  the chorus is really catchy and intricate.   the solos on this song are the best part of the album.      Gears of War:(8/10) not very cool up until the first chorus (which would make a perfect ringtone) and then after that it is really cool.  one of the less remarkable songs on the album    Blessed are the Dead: (9/10) Doesn't start out awesome, but this song builds really well. the reason it is not a ten is that it ends a little abruptly to me and also starts a little slow, but it has a lot of great parts to it.  Really catchy chorus about the four horsemen of the apocolypse, the part between the first chorus and second verse is awesome( Dave says \\"Blessed Are the Dead\\" and then an emergency siren goes off in the backround and it is chilling), and then the solos after the second chorus to end the song are some of the coolest on the album.  a really wierd sound to them to.  A very original song    Play for Blood:(9/10)  The coolest chorus on the album  I Don't Play for Keeps, I Play for Blood!!!  its f****n' rockin'.  this is really just like a straight up rocker song,  no themes about polotics or evilness, just about winning and Playing for blood.   There are probablyabout 8 solos on this song, and they are all awesome. this one is also really fast.      A Toute Le Monde (set me free): (6/10)   the worst song on the album   the lacuna coil girl is LAME on this song and it doesn't have the same classic depressive feel of the original .    Amerikhastan: (9/10)   this one really reminds me of punk bands, like bad religion especially,  not in that it has a super intelligent message with an oversized vocabulary, but in the way that it is constructed.  It is like, not a verse, but a rant, like the song on No Substance that starts out with \\"Neighbors,...\\" and after both rants it goes into really radical solos and then a really catchy and smart chorus.   most of this song isn't really musical, it is mostly just radical.       You're Dead: (8.5/10) it has an original verse style and a really odd chorus.  Very heavy     Burnt Ice: (9.5/10) A song about doing drugs.  This is the last song for a reason. The verses are pretty cool, and the chorus is alright, but it ends with a bang as it has solos that definitely match up to Hangar 18.  This ends this albums with big bang      Overall this album is the most original of all the megadeth albums ,other than maybe The System Has Failed, but unlike tshf this album is ALL heavy and ALL fast (other than A Tout le chance originale est plus bon).  All of the verses are significantly different and so are the choruses.  This is probably the one Megadeth album where All of the songs have been stuck in my head at one point.
1400079276|5.0|I have read ever single book Murakami has written and he still has the power to engage and engross the reader even though you basically know what's coming-yet have no idea how it will happen. <br /> <br />This work takes several of Murakami's trademarks and sharpens the devices to a fine edge.  The urban anomie that characterizes all of his novels is on display--though here in a venue well outside the normal world of Tokyo.  The intertwined stories--here of a teenage runaway and an old survivor of a freak wartime \\"accident\\"--that ultimately intersect in unexpected ways.  The characters that are weirdly unnatural yet completely normal.  The aspects of mystical realism-- Nakata, the old fellow in the second story strand can talk to cats:  several WW II vets appear still living--if that's the word--in a timeless world adjacent to ours in eerily vacant circumstances--that somehow seem perfectly normal circumstances.  All of that is on display wielded as a philosophical journey by a master craftsman. <br /> <br />This is a tale that involves loss of personality of a character who nonetheless captures our imagination with his unique talents and worldview, another that is the picture of internal discipline yet is probably schizophrenic, another who's real gender is totally at question. In many ways the most riveting character may be a boy in a painting whom we never know as anything other than a boy in a pointing. Not the standard mainstream fare yet Murakami takes us on their journey and we willingly go because we feels all of their pain and angst as they do.   <br /> <br />In point of fact I'd rate this book just a hair behind The Wind Up Bird Chronicles.  That's pretty rarified territory.  It's a place you want to experience.  Read this book. <br />
4770030096|5.0|If you're looking for a good book to learn Japanese language, you probably have too many choices flooding your mind and have no idea which one is for you, because every one of them seems good. So, why this one?<br /><br />This book is very well organized. It contains 11 units to cover the most practical topics surviving in Japan, such as meeting people, shopping, gettig around, dinning out, visiting a japanese home, responding inquiries at office, and socializing, etc. Each unit is consist of a culture note, a specific grammar syntax and usage, and a couple of lessons. Each lesson starts with a short dialogue to illustrate the common conversation of the unit's topic. It also provides a detail explanation on the sentence usage and the new vocabulary introduced in the dialogue. Few exercises are followed to help readers to get familiarized and practice what they have just learned. An audio CD is also accompanied with this book to demonstrate the conversation addressed in each dialogues. At the end of the book, it comes with the Appendixes, which provides a summary of all the particles, sentence patterns, adjectives, etc. in a list with examples and reference to the book's units & lessons. In addition, it has a mini-dictionary with english to japanese and japanese to english. This book also makes use of a lot of pictures to illustrate dialogues and exercises. It really helps the reader to have a more relax and interesting learning journey. After finishing this book, you should be able to have the following skills: (i) basic usage of nouns, verbs, adjectives, (b) basic conversation for essential everyday siturations, and (c) reading and writing hiragana & katakana.<br /><br />Well, although there's a romanji version of this \\"Japanese for Busy People I (Revised 3rd Edition)\\", I would still recommend the readers to get this \\"Kana\\" version to learn the real Japanese in a Japanese character forms. If you do not know about the Japanese sound system, hiragana and katakana. You can pick up the \\"Japanese for Busy People I: Kana Workbook\\", which is an excellent book for starters. After that, go for this \\"Japanese for Busy People I: Kana Version\\". Indeed, this is the best!<br /><br />(Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 17-May-2007)a.

B0001WGIBW|5.0|Trains are my son's favorite things, right next to cars and playing in the dirt.  We even enjoy playing with these -- and I can not say that for other toys.  Great for being able to figure out how to piece things together, and he and dad make some amazing lay outs.  I wish this pack had more switcher tracks but you can buy them separately.  My son also loves the elevated tracks (the inclines) which this set does not contain, but again, you can buy them separately.  It is good to have up and down play and it makes it more fun for the adults too.  Overall, good track, cheaper than Thomas brand and totally interchangeable with Thomas tracks and Trains.  Brio is a better buy and just as durable (the tracks, at least) -- good number of track for the money.
0374105235|4.0|At the end of a chapter in A Long Way Gone, Ishmael Beah talks about his feelings on leaving New York (where he went for a UN conference) to go back to Sierra Leone:    \\"I was sad to leave, but I was also pleased to have met people outside of Sierra Leone.  Because if I get killed upon my return, I knew that a memory of my existence was alive somewhere in the world.\\"  (page 200)    I think that this passage best encapsulates what's best about Beah's novel - the simple, to the point prose with death lurking in the background and the fact that his memories will forever live on and will haunt and touch people around the globe with his superb memoir.    Beah is a gifted, natural storyteller and the story he weaves of him getting caught up in fighting a war before his fifteenth birthday and his eventual freedom is a classic \\"Heroes Journey\\" and is captivating reading.  It isn't always easy - while he doesn't dwell on his years as a soldier he pulls no punches when detailing his combat experiences.  Beah chooses simple, straight-forward language in telling his tale and it serves the book well.  The narrative never drags and Beah allows the reader to come to his or her own conclusions and judgements about the tragedies that happened to him without ever getting on a soapbox and lecturing.          My only complaint with the novel and the reason it gets four stars is that it comes to a grinding, rather abrupt ending.  I realize that life doesn't always offer a neat, satisfying conclusion but it really feels like there are an additional fifty pages missing from the novel once you finish it.    Despite this gripe, the book is powerful, eye-openning reading.  Strongly recommended.

B000002A3T|2.0|Some may argue that Pink Floyd without Roger Waters, is a bit like Beatles without John Lennon. Some unkind souls might even suggest that it's a bit like Beatles without John or Paul. Without its erstwhile bass player and chief wordsmith, this is music without its former intellectual edge, bite and urgency. What's left? Sleek musicianship, a hip brand and a reassuringly expensive, car-stereo-friendly sound.<br /><br />The Division Bell has its moments and David Gilmour can still work the magic with his guitar. But the thing is, without Waters' artistic vision and wit to provide a thematic backbone, the resultant music is comes across as mere sheen and veneer. To me this sounds more like a David Gilmour solo album than a Pink Floyd work.<br /><br />Musically the band retreads old ground on much of the album. On Cluster, it's back to Wish You Were Here and the group tries to breath new life into the atmospheric intro formula of Shine On You...part 1. On  'What Do You Want From Me?' we revisit Dark Side of the Moon territory, completely with gospel backing vocals, trademark guitar solo &agrave; la Time. David Gilmour handles guitar and vocal duties with aplomb but the package is bathed in so much reverb that the group sounds like it's playing down the far end of the Grand Canyon.<br /><br />On Take it Back, Pink Floyd come on like a cross between U2 and Dire Straits, while on Great Day for Freedom tired imagery and a pedestrian melody remind us once again how important Mr. Waters was the formula.<br />High Hopes probably constitutes the quality core of this record, an impressive dirge that captures the spirit of Comfortably Numb, though even this song is let down by a tediously repetitive middle section.<br />To sum up, this record sounds big and expensive and sold in bucketloads, but for me, it lacks the substance and inventiveness to satisfy the 'serious' Pink Floyd fan.<br /><br />On a final note, many of the five star reviews here seem to be simple marketing input. There's a word for it but I forget what it is.'s a word for it but I forget what it is.

In addition, the weird viral \\"Year Zero\\" marketing campaign was so effective that his record company even got it wrong (trying to sue file-sharers that Reznor intentionally leaked music to) and fed into the whole guerrilla music feel.<br /><br />I also found it a bit ironic that I am typing this review of \\"Year Zero\\" a mere day after the death of Jerry Falwell, for whom the concept of intentionally bombing an American city to rally the faithful probably would have seemed like a good idea, especially to a left-behinder. As Reznor explores megalomania on \\"God Given,\\" \\"Capitol G\\" and the final realization of the grand-wrongdoing in the terrific \\"Zeros and Ones,\\" the crowd of Right Wing Neo-Cons and their trusty Faith Based Fraud Sidekicks may see themselves reflected in a fun-house mirror. That is only, of course, if they actually tear themselves away from Fox News and The 700 Club long enough to listen to rock music.
0618680004|3.0|Richard Dawkins is a professor, and one cannot escape that knowledge when you read this book. Professor Dawkins makes his points, but sometimes those points are beaten too deeply into the pages. I did read the book, but I found myself skipping to the end of some chapters once I had  reached a certain level of understanding of what the author was trying to say.  <br /> <br />Overall, I think I purchased this book looking for material that was convincing to those opposed to Prof. Dawkin's views, but after reading it, I think the book is preaching more to the choir than a skeptical congregation.
0143057375|5.0|If you are familiar with Eckhart Tolle writings you will undoubtedly find this latest installment a pivotal spiritual masterpiece in writing. Eckhart Tolle clearly succeeds in assisting us all in the spiritual awakening process that we all face. \\"The New Earth\\" follows up the \\"Power of Now\\" with a greater sense of awareness of living in the present moment and how to apply these principles to our daily lives. A must read for everyone who is starting or traveling the path of spiritual growth.
0385333846|5.0|This book does not have as much comic relief as Vonnegut's wonderfully entertaining Cat's Cradle or Breakfast of Champions - after all the story tries to explain the awful effect of war on the human condition as his main character, Billy Pilgrim, survives the bombing of Dresden during World War II.  Yet, his clever way of giving the reader the perspective of his characters and of injecting his own insight, will keep you turning the pages.  There is no doubt in my mind that reading all of Vonnegut's works will make you laugh, cry, and most importantly - think.
0722533942|5.0|Very few books I read were as deeply moving and as insightful as this one. It really changed me; it was intrinsically rewarding. The story may not be for everyone, but for me, I was transformed. I've read it years ago, and looking back it's one of the books of most personal impact I've read. The story is beautiful, the message is beautiful, affecting, moving. It will give you a wonderfully new and exhilirating perspective on the meaningfulness of living. I highly recommend it.
0060392886|5.0|Nothing can prepare you for what is in this book.  Do yourself a favor and just read it.  You don't even have to like Motley Crue, although you will after you finish.  Hands down the most entertaining, hardest-to-put-down book I have ever read.
038533348X|4.0|It is an interesting book with a masterful writing style. My appreciation of this book was largely literary. But it is not personally touching or inspiring or meaningful. For that read Paulo Coelho. The story is not exactly as \\"thought-provoking\\" as people have been claiming. For that read philosophy. <br /> <br />Some parts are very funny, many parts are interesting, and it is a very easy read. The plot is purposely ridiculous, and tangibly depressing. It is worthwhile, if you know what to expect (satire, dry humor, captivating writing, but not anything deep, moving, inspiring, wise, etc.)
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Absolutely riveting. The camerawork is astounding, with many of the images captured for the first time. You MUST see it on a large wide-screen, at least 42 inches.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I'm like a lot of other reviewers, a huge Linkin Park fan who feels very confused about this album.  It seems like the more I listen to it, the more I'll like it.  However, it is slower and softer than than most LP fans are used to, and probably more than most LP fans want.  I suppose this album is a more 'mature' sound but songs like 'What I've done' and 'Given Up' really make me miss the old Linkin Park sound. <br /> <br />Shinoda is hardly present, and it shows.  I understand that he's an incredible producer, but he is also an integral part to the band's sound and he needs to be there. <br /> <br />Truthfully, two of my favorite tracks were the bonus live versions of 'Faint' and 'What I've Done', both bonus tracks.  I feel like Fort Minor's album came closer than Minutes to Midnight to delivering what I wanted from Linkin Park.
0060977493|1.0|I think a lot of people either really loved this book or hated it. It just didn't appeal to me. I didn't like how slow it was or how the story was revolved around that silly secret. I read this after reading a lot of Rohinton Mistry though. Maybe my expectations were too high, but it just wasn't for me.
B000063DIH|2.0|Here to Eternity? Weekend Warrior? Give me a break! Pretty Weak.... I hate the stupid bar band stuff. Maiden wrote smarter songs before.Anything From the 80's would suit better if you are new to Maiden.... There was no growth here at all. There are a couple goodies here too. BE quick is OK, Fear of is OK, Just not enough to make it worthwhile. Try Brave New World. Adrian is back and it has many better songs
B000L212HC|1.0|The movie itself is great and you should definately watch it. <br /> <br />What you should NOT do is buy this Blu-Ray disc which has approximate 10 minutes of UNSKIPPABLE trailers and then to add injury to insult, after you, a paying customer has bought the disc and shown you are one of the good guys they make you watch a UNSKIPPABLE \\"don't pirate movies\\" propaganda piece effectively calling you a criminal!!! <br /> <br />Pop the disc in and you will not be able to watch the movie for at least 10 minutes. Everyone who bought this disc should return it until the studios get the message.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Lady and the Tramp was one of my favorite movies in childhood.  Watching it again only supports my endeared feelings I have had for so many years.  I am glad I was able to watch, go back and experience like I did when I was a child.  This movie, I will always hold dear.  The talent has transcended into this decade and has kept the meaning of romance and true love alive with the music and animation.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I can't believe I have been waiting 4 years for this garbage.  Linkin Park sounds like a completely different band on Minutes to Midnight.  There are only 2-3 good songs and even those can't hold a candle to the worst songs on their previous albums.  If you want to hear some songs that sound like the old LP, sign up for the LP Underground.  The LPU membership comes with a CD that contains a few tracks that didn't make it onto the album.  QWERTY, a great song that was supposed to be part of the album, made it onto the LPU v6 CD.
B00005RDRO|5.0|Good price - got here in GREAT time, even with super saver shipping...  The movie is hysterical and timeless.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I was disappointed with the previous 3-4 Bond movies so I did not expect this to be better. Well, it proved me wrong, I think Daniel did a great job, the plot was very good, but the girl James was into wasn't all that. Audio and Video transfer is great, a must buy!
B000OCXMAE|2.0|To the supposed musically enlightened people that tell you to give this album a break.  They could have come up with this garbage in year 1 of their hiatus.  I'm not sure how they can spin that this piece of junk took 4 years to make.  I call a major BS, and I love LP.  Why change?  Why fool millions and millions of fans into buying this bust?  How do you tour and play these songs?   <br /> <br />It's almost like an action/thriller author deciding to write a romance novel.  I suggest borrowing someones copy or ripping it.  $10 is too much to pay for this one.  Sorry LP fans.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|While this album has more of a country tilt in comparison to her self-titled debut album, The Story will not disappoint old fans or discourage new followers. Brandi has a voice that can be heard for miles, with songs like The Story and Late Morning Lullaby showcasing her talent. <br /> <br />Don't miss Brandi if she happens to be playing in a town near you. I've seen her live twice, and will again when her next tour passes through Austin. I'd catch a show as soon as possible, because the intimacy of the small club/bar atmosphere will soon be in the past as Brandi is becoming more of a household name. (Watch and listen to any Grey's Anatomy episode if you don't believe me).
B000NVIGC0|3.0|amazing to me how everyone here is a 'huge' tweedy fan yet the best thing he's done since YHF, Loose Fur's Born Again in the USA has only gotten 8 reviews and it has been out exactly a year.  <br />This album has been out for one day and has 32 reviews already. Born Again is pretty much the same band as Wilco and let me tell you: it crushes A Ghost is Born and possibly crushes this album but it is way too early to review Sky Blue Sky. Can't believe anyone can actually write a review and think they know this album yet. Sky Blue Sky could be Tweedys Suicaine Gratification.. lets hope not.  <br />Buy Born Again if you want a great album start to finish that you don't have to try so hard to like.  <br />Disregard my star rating because it is too soon to review SBS.  <br />
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|classic movie,  one to watch over and over. one of coopers best
B00006ADFL|5.0|Long before he found international success with THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and a fabulous remake of KING KONG, Peter Jackson made the brilliant and unforgettable HEAVENLY CREATURES (1994, New Zealand).  The source is the shocking and scary Parker-Hulme murder case in 1954 Christchurch that galvanized New Zealand.  The case is less well known in the United States, and a gorgeous new letterboxed DVD has no bonus material (...)    I don't know how much plot to give away here, except to say that the film ends with a violent crime that is hinted at in the opening scene when teenagers Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme (an auspicious film debut for both Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey) come running out of a forest covered in blood and saying someone is dead.  We then flash back to 1952 and work our way forward to a 1954 finale.  The movie was filmed in Panavision (by Alun Bollinger) in rich yellows and oranges as the two girls develop a deep friendship that includes kisses and baths together.  The two are very different.  Pauline is shy and inward, while Juliet is open and sophisticated.  The daughter of a university professor, Juliet has been all over the world at age 15 and suffers from tuberculosis.  Pauline is a quiet wallflower who has never left New Zealand.    The more their parents and teachers worry about their friendship, the more Juliet and Pauline retreat inside a fantasy world of claymation figures, gorgeous gardens, and Mario Lanza records.  In that fantasy world, Juliet is nicknamed \\"Devora\\" and Pauline is called \\"Yvonne\\" or \\"Gina\\".  I adore a musical number in the fantasy world, with the girls dancing to Mario singing \\"The Loveliest Night of the Year.\\" (It is the real Lanza on real records throughout the film.)  Yellows and oranges blend with scary blues on nighttime interiors.  Writers Jackson and Frances Walsh got an Oscar nomination for their Original Screenplay.  I like the way teen sex in the real world is juxtaposed against religion and murder in the fantasy world.    And I like the way colors contrast in wide screen (the pan/scan videocassette is a visual mess) and the way the real world of early 1950's Christchurch contrasts with the fantasy world of WETA design clay figures.  The technical credits will be very familiar to anyone who has seen a LORD OF THE RINGS movie--editor Jamie Selkirk, costumer Ngila Dickson, writers Jackson and Walsh (husband and wife), production designer Grant Major, and others.  It's a beautifully made movie.    The ending packs a shocking jolt, even when you can guess what will happen.  HEAVENLY CREATURES deserves its \\"R\\" rating (for violence and sexual content).  Juliet has to go to South Africa with Dad for her health (lung tuberculosis), which gets Pauline distraught and even suicidal.  She has a frighteningly amoral solution--kill Mom.  \\"It can be an accident,\\" she rationalizes.  \\"People die every day.\\"  So a crime will take place.  End crawls say the girls were too young for the death penalty, so they were imprisoned until adulthood, then ordered never to see or write to one another again.  That's a rough punishment for these two.    Fascinatingly, it was divulged that Juliet and Pauline were taking anti-depressant drugs that have long since been banned from the market.  (I have mental illness myself and would love to know what the drugs were.  I'm sure my doctors would like to know also.)  And Juliet's story at least has a happy ending:  she surfaced several decades later in Scotland, where she currently writes murder mysteries under the name \\"Anne Perry\\".  I've read a couple of the novels, and they are outstanding.  So I am glad she was not executed in 1954.  I may be wrong, I'd have to check the web site.  But I think Pauline moved to England and found religion as an adult.    What a movie HEAVENLY CREATURES is for mature adults who feel up to its bloodbath finale.  It is flawlessly made, with gorgeous color and wide-screen, fascinating blendings of reality and fantasy thateventually become one for Juliet and Pauline.  It is chilling stuff, a true-life crime case.  It is fascinating to see the enormously talented Kate Winslet as a teenager at the start of a magnificent career; she was born an actress.  And it is interesting to see what Peter Jackson was up to before LORD OF THE RINGS.  The new DVD of CREATURES is the uncut 109 minute Director's Cut, never before seen in the United States.  The original American version ran 99 minutes.  I had also never seen the movie in Panavision since 1994 in a theater.  It really needs to be experienced in wide-screen format.  Seen uncut and in wide-screen in a night bedroom, I love CREATURES more than the cold LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, if not more than the wondrous KING KONG.  It is a must for the mature members of the Winslet and Jackson fan clubs.
B000002KET|5.0|Depending upon where you stand regarding Black Sabbath's so-called progressive tendencies, you may find Sabbath Bloody Sabbath a little too removed from earlier efforts to appreciate it without some justification.  With the introduction of synthesizers and relatively glossy production, including orchestral strings, it can be considered an anomaly or, comparing it even to post-Ozzy efforts, the culmination of their artistic vision.  Either way it's a very impressive album that shows what Sabbath was capable of even if they chose not to pursue it further.  True to form, Bloody Sabbath delivers heavy riffs to move the songs along, and each one gets fair treatment (the instrumental, Fluff, falls outside this scope but is produced well beyond Iommi's typically random guitar musings).  Beyond that, grand presentation and careful attention to detail elevate Bloody Sabbath to a dazzling masterpiece of shiny, yet worthy metal, and yet another hurdle for imitators to overcome.  There's no uncertainty here, no filler, no reaching beyond their capability.  It's an amazing and satisfying album that belongs in every Sabbath and metal fan's collection.

B000NVIGC0|3.0|Well, it's kind of good.  I read one review in Entertainment Weekly that said it was an Eagles album, which scared the heck out of me, luckily, it's not an Eagles album.  I like most of the songs, and it's a better album than A Ghost is Born, which aside from Handshake Drugs and ATWSS, sounded like a string of B-Sides.  I enjoy five out of the first six songs, then have to skip a few, and like What Light.  I would compare Wilco to Radiohead, Being There, Summerteeth, and YHT are much like The Bends and OK Computer, absolutely brilliant, then the albums get spotty for me.  I am a huge Wilco fan, so I buy the albums, but I can't believe someone who isn't a huge fan would be happy with the last two studio releases.  I'll just keep listening to Kicking Television and my concert CD's, remembering the old days...
B000002URV|5.0|....wait more than 1 1/2 months to receive it. <br />I live in a small city, is not easy to find this kind of music... and if you have luck, 30 usd or more for each CD.  <br />Enigma is the beginning of the NO end for New age's music.  <br />Thank you amazon.  <br />
B00003XB8K|5.0|What a phrase!!!!! <br />Every body find a different meaning for each word or sentence, for this CD I found the smooth part of the world of Enigma.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This is one of my very favorite movie musicals. The songs are so great and so much fun! <br /> <br />My favorite part about this movie though, is the way in which it constantly cuts back and forth between simultaneous shots of what the characters are doing in the \\"movie\\" version and what they are doing in the \\"stage\\" version of the story. It is this symmetrical blending of the two arts that really appeals to me, and the cinematography is very well done. <br /> <br />Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, John C. Reilly, and Queen Latifah all put on award-winning performances. I was especially impressed with Gere's and Reilly's performances. (Lucy Liu's small part was nice simply because she is so gorgeous, LOL, but she really is only a brief side character.) <br /> <br />This is the best and most enjoyable stage-musical-to-movie adaptation that I have yet seen, and I highly recommend it. Is it the best movie-musical ever? Probably not, I'd have to vote for The Sound Of Music, but even so, I find myself watching Chicago more often than TSOM. And Moulin Rouge is even funnier than Chicago, but I still love Chicago's songs the best. <br />
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I'm a huge Linkin Park fan. I have always loved their alternative sound. This cd was not Likin Park. It sounded like a different band all together. I was disappointed with it. I feel that when a band finds a good sound that works they should stick with it. Hopefully their next cd will be better.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|It's a very special box set to fans. There are no doubts everyone should get one to laugh with this amazing show, specially with the extra. But if you order it from Amazon, just hope you don't get it damaged like me. The red box is torn on both corners, but I'm waiting for good news. <br />And it would've been great if the set had portuguese subtitles (since i am a Brazilian costumer). <br /> <br />Anyway you can have the best fun with this.
B000001FRY|1.0|Lousy, godawful drivel that makes me want to dig a hole and bury the CD as if by instinct alone -- and by godawful, I mean Jesus nasty! This is what your hip bible study group leader plays on picnic day to keep things edgy. It often sounds like a band member is choking the singer who has the clown name. Kinda like James Taylor on a bennie bender, like he's been jogging for hours in a chicken suit in the desert while sucking on sandpaper. Then there's that high-maintenance lead guitarist with the rockin' chops, a steely 'tude and quite the bone-chilling nickname. But wait, 'cuz I haven't forgotten the pair with the regular names. Just ordinary guys, folks. Of course that one guy, the bassist, he tries to hang with the big dogs, but he just comes off like a slightly-demented car mechanic. I take it Silver Surfer boy is the apologetic one, holding the others' hands as they peer into the porcelain depths and repeatedly offer up last night's meal.
0618551050|5.0|This book has value not only as an entertaining discussion of string theory, but as a first-person description of history. I'm an exact contemporary of Lee Smolin's, and was an undergraduate physics concentrator at the same university where he got his Ph.D. His descriptions of the utterly un-philosophical (actually, anti-philosophical) atmosphere in that physics department and the emphasis on calculation during that era are 100% spot-on.     As he describes, we raced from one ad hoc method of calculation to another without any motivation being offered, other than the oracular words of, e.g., Jackson's E&M text (or in math, G-d help us, Dieudonné). Not only philosophy, but basic physical intuition was scorned. (The Uncertainty Principle? No physics needed, it's just a property of Gaussians. The difference between covariant and contravariant quantities? It's obvious: one's got Greek indices on top, the other has them on the bottom.) Some of us, myself included, got disgusted with this and wound up in law, business or medicine. A couple of my classmates who really did have physical intuition or a gift for teaching wound up spending many years in the postdoc wilderness after their MIT, Princeton, etc. Ph.D.s. But others of my generation (at institutions across the country) found a way to get with the prevailing program, and then to inflict even higher levels of abstraction on the generation that they taught -- whence string theory. I hope that LS's description of his experience will serve as a warning for researchers now in their 20s and 30s, so that this spiral of intellectual waste can be broken.      As with any book, this one does have some  limitations. I was disappointed that the so-called \\"sociological\\" aspects of the book seem stuck in the 70's-style, Thomas Kuhn paradigm that so many of us were fed in college. LS's description, towards the end of the book, of how scientists form an ethical community sounds way too idealistic even compared to the antics of preprint-hoarding, data-hiding  investigators I saw during our college days, when money from NASA and other government agencies was flowing more freely than today. His chapter called \\"how science really works\\" is a bit biased towards LS's own field; most grant money goes to life sciences these days, and even in the physical sciences there are many pressures like patents and tech transfer that LS doesn't address. The chapter should either have had a broader scope or a narrower title. Moreover, social science researchers like Philip Mirowski, Esther-Mirjam Sent, Thomas Fuller, and others are making real contributions to science studies (albeit at times expressed a bit snarkily and smugly) by using rigorous historical methods to show how, e.g., funding sources influence the conduct of science and even the philosophy of science. Some of these folks, e.g. Mirowski, call themselves economists, so most physicists don't read them. But this part of LS's book would have benefited from some of their more interdisciplinary outlook.     The book also shares a prejudice even older than the 1970s, that \\"theoretical physics\\" is about cosmology, particle physics and quantum theories. This ignores, among other things, the current renaissance in stat mech (see, e.g., the range of topics covered in J. Sethna's recent text), and the whole field of condensed matter. Take a look at P.-G. de Gennes's beautiful book on scaling concepts in polymer physics (to say nothing of his work on liquid crystals, dynamics of wetting, etc.) - that's lovely theoretical physics. Moreover, go to any meeting of, say, the Materials Research Society, and you'll find it rife with collaborations among theoreticians, experimenters, physicists, chemists, biologists and EEs. The fertility of materials science, biological physics and similar multi-word disciplines probably is related to the increased importance today of private funding, and to life science's replacement of high-energy physics as where the \\"action\\" is.That's not necessarily a bad thing - the key to having more hope about physics may be to take a less parochial view of what constitutes it.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Quality production!  What a series - the photography, the information, and the way it is presented - all top notch.  What an incredible value for the $$.  I really feel that I got my money's worth with this purchase.  This is the BBC edition narrated by David Attenborough.
076781214X|2.0|This was a truly strange movie, from multiple perspectives.  Firstly that Francis Ford Coppola would choose something like a pseudo romantic comedy to add to his resume.  Secondly that Nicholas Cage would star as the male lead, when he was known before as being the dingbat bumbling fool and after as the brooding dark eccentric.  And third, the whole premise of the movie was just plain odd. <br /> <br />Kathleen Turner plays Peggy Sue, a divorced, middle aged and unhappy woman who goes to her high school reunion despite all her misgivings.  At the reunion she faints, then wakes up back in time.  She is once again in high school.  She is given a chance to do it all over again. <br /> <br />The foundation of this movie was not odd, as it's been the theme of many sci fi and fantasy films past and present.  There are a few funny moments with the typical fish out of water / anachronism humor (I also remembered going to my high school reunion and remarking that a lot of things they taught were so useless - You didn't take Honors English last year so you have to stay in the Special Ed English class! - You can't have study hall! Gym class is priority! - Take the science elective or you won't get into college!, etc.).  She starts off the movie saying that had she known then what she knows now, she would have done things much differently.  We all think that at one point or another.  And she does do some things differently, like going for the mysterious poet she always admired from afar.  But, she doesn't do things differently in the end.  She is approached by the school nerd who would grow up to be a wealthy and successful man, and when he proposes that she change her destiny and marry him, she refuses.  Peggy Sue said she wanted to go back to the present because she missed her kids.  Missed her kids?!  If she stayed in this time or went with someone else her kids wouldn't exist!  She ends up with her husband, perhaps because of this reason, and essentially continues back downthe same path. <br /> <br />That was a disappointment, a major disappointment.  She goes back in time and doesn't affect the future in a positive way, except to afirm to herself that she is content being miserable in the present.  And how about that weird scene with her grandparents and trying to send her back in time at the Shriners' convention?  Too stupid for words.  The best part of this movie was Nicholas Cage, in that it would spring board him into other roles and a successful movie career.  Otherwise don't waste your time.

B00000K3CR|4.0|I'm not a big Tom Hanks fan, I admit, but I do admire him for what he was able to achieve.  He is one of the few actors who started off as a comic and made a successful transition to dramatic actor that was accepted by audiences and peers alike.  This was, I believe, his transition role that would lead him into his dramatic future. <br /> <br />Tom Hanks plays Josh (as an adult).  Josh makes a wish on a carnival game that he were big.  The next day, he wakes up a 12 year old boy in a 30 year old's body.  Suddenly driven out of the house, he is now forced into the adult world overnight and must deal with all the hilarious adult things from a kid's perspective. <br /> <br />It was a good movie, put into that catagory of \\"feel good\\", to be sure.  But, it was a little too hooky for my tastes now.  When he wakes up a 30 year old man, how would he ever get his own place to live, a job, and a girlfriend if he had the mind of a 12 year old?  In New York City, no less.  The scene in the toy store was cute, of course, and it just so happens that he gets a job working for a toy company. <br /> <br />I recently read that they changed the ending.  The original ending was that he would make a wish on the same game to be 12 again, and, his girlfriend would also wish to be 12 with him.  Test audiences said they didn't want this to happen, they wanted them to split.  I would have been curious as to see what the outcome could have been if they went with the original ending.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Recent Bond movies have been floundering to find a persona and a voice to match the originals with Sean Connery.  While this film has it's high-tech moments, it is exciting and gritty in a way we haven't seen for years.  Daniel Craig passed the audition!  The initial chase scene sets the tone wonderfully.  The plot is a little convoluted, but all resolves nicely.  Well done!
B00005JPKE|5.0|This is an outstanding production that shows the defenders of Iwo Jima in a much more human light.  Previous movies that dealt with Iwo Jima, including Flags of Out Fathers, didn't really show the defenders.  This film redresses that imbalance to some degree. <br /> <br />General Kuribayashi's tactics were excellent in a loosing cause.  His regard for America is well known and shown in flash backs without being heavy handed.  His interaction with the wife of an American officer during a social function is quite impressive.  The film demonstrates that not only was the general preparing to fight the Americans who were sure to land on Iwo Jima but he also had to fight his superiors in Tokyo and subordinates on Iwo Jima.  That he did as well as he did is a tribute to his leadership.   <br /> <br />Through the use of two privates, Saigo and Shimizu we see the other end of the Japanese military system.  Saigo is a conscript baker who is the opposite of the sterotypical Japanese warrior.  His inability to hit the target is punished by his officer with the order to clean every man's boots in the commnad.  Kuribayashi witnesses this incident and thinks out load that cleaning the rifles might be more prodcutive.  This same officer disobeys the order to evacuate the tunnels under Suribachi and orders the deaths of his men.  Saigo and a companion disobey and leave the tunnels.  Saigo has several interactions with Kuribayashi and ultimately performs a final service for his general. <br /> <br />Shimizu is a thrown out member of the Japanese military police (kempetai) who is sent to Iwo Jima after failing to carry out an order.  He too is disillusioned with the army and is determined to surrender at the first opportunity.  He does so and unfortunately for him is left by his captors under the supervision of two Marines, one of which shoots his two prisoners of war.  A small detail but serves to illustrate that not all brutalities against prisoners were carried out by the Japanese.<br /> <br />The filming in almost a black and white style with minimal color was excellent.  It demonstrates the desolation of the island and it's being cut off from the rest of Japan.  You can almost feel the heat and humidity as the soldiers dig into Suribachi and the surrounding ground.  It is quite effective. <br /> <br />The film demonstrates the futility of this battle for the Japanese.  It also deomonstrates the bankrupt decision making process in Tokyo.  The Japanese fleet, which was supposed to assist in the defense of the island had been essentially wiped out in mid-1944 and while Kuribayashi knew this, the leaders on the island didn't.  This little detail was not relayed to Iwo Jima.  Kuribayashi relieves the admiral commanding naval forces on the island and sends him back to Tokyo to tell the general staffs of the conditions on Iwo Jima yet with the knowledge there is little that can be done for the isolated island. <br /> <br /> <br />Saigo manages to survive the battle.  When last seen he is on a stretcher on the beach awaiting evacuaiton to a US ship.  At least one person, although fictional, survives to see his wife and daughter again we presume.  He is representative of the handful of survivors of the Japanese army and navy who were able to return to a totally destroyed Japan.   <br /> <br />I might have a skewed perspective of this event since I am living in Japan and have been watching the desire of some in Japan to reinvigorate the armed forces of Japan.  There are still some ultranationalists who have been unwilling to learn or remember from the mistakes of the past.  I see these events in the here and now and then see the disaster of Iwo Jima and realize that for some today they seem intent on learning nothing and remembering nothing.  Letters. . . is a good reminder of what the corrupted form of Bushido that was practiced in the years before and during World War II by the Japanese military resulted in.   <br /> <br />I urge everyone to see this film and reflect on the outcome and the cost to both sides.  It is an excellent complement to Flags of Our Fathers. <br />
0743454537|3.0|My book club loved this book, yet I was disappointed.  The first few chapters lead me to believe that this compelling controversy would be  explored.  I felt that the reality of the conflict was never truely developed.  There were several unrealistic happenings; the judge never orderd an independent psychiatrist, a lawyer with uncontrolled epilepsy drives, no one wonders what the youngest daughter's motivation is, no on asks the sick daughter what she thinks of the situation.  I agree with another review: the ending was as if the author got tired of writing and took the easy way out.  Lovely character development, but theme was left hanging.

But it doesn't detract from the fact that this is a fun book, with lots of vignettes and pictures.
B00005JLCI|5.0|We can safely say now that every previous version of Hamlet  can take a seat and let the Kenneth Branagh version shine for the awesome film that it is! and if I may say so, the Mel Gibson version can go out the back door and don't look back! I saw the Kenneth Branagh version when it first came out at a local art theater and it was the most wonderful experience to see it on the big screen, for being a long film, it did not feel like it even with an intermission. This is the version to have. William Shakespeare would probably agree that only Kenneth Branagh could do justice to Hamlet. Good things come to those who wait, indeed applies to all of us who waited for this version on DVD.

1582701709|4.0|Since I first heard about this book, I never though of reading it because I don't believe most of the things we hear about the law of attraction.    I bought it as a gift for my wife, and curiosity convinced me to have a look at the foreword, then the first part,... finally I got through it in 2 days. I found it to be a very very interesting read, although I don't believe \\"word-for-word\\" was is written by the numerous \\"attraction law experts\\". I think \\"The Secret\\" exists, but you will need more then you're thoughts to get what you are aiming for.     The advices given in this book are well worth the money spent for it and the short time reading it (it is a real quick read), but after that don't expect a miracle. The great parts are about positive thoughts and visualization. Even if you do not worship the law of attraction of any \\"God\\", tips given in this book can make anyone's life better.

0671042858|3.0|I've read quite a few of King's greatest books and this one is very different. First, it is a short novel, so even if you don't love it you may get through it quickly (like I did...).<br /><br />Second, it is not really scary, the story seems endless and after 150 pages I was tired of the Tom Gordon intrigue. So, why is it not that bad ?!? Well, the main character (Trisha, a little girl lost in the woods) is very attaching and the story is well told by King. The description of the woods and Trisha's feelings is intense and keeps you turning the pages.<br /><br />So, if you like King's long descriptions and you are in for a short relax read, this book is still a good choice.

B000MZHW40|4.0|A gritty action flick set in Africa, BLOOD DIAMOND features Leonardo DiCaprio as a smuggler who learns that Djimon Houson has found a large diamond and partners with him to recover the hidden stone and rescue his (Hounson's) family. Obstacles to these goals include a brutal civil war and greedy mercenaries. Both DiCaprio and Hounson give strong performances with DiCaprio nicely managing a couple of different dialects. Jennifer Connelly is passable as the magazine writer/journalist with good intentions and the nose for a good story who befriends DiCaprio and provides minimal romantic interest. Unfortunately, the film is laced with a strong preachness that contaminates any pure, honest story-telling and descends BLOOD DIAMOND into a vehicle for political propaganda. Apparently, the movie would claim, consumers who buy diamonds are supporting all kinds of awful things, from murderous civil war to corruption to terrorism. This is a conjecture not supported by sustainable arguement in the film. However, if you don't mind paying to be preached to or if you can ignore the shrill, emotional flim-flam of the latest leftist cause celebre, then BLOOD DIAMOND offers entertainment value as a rollickingly good action flick.

B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I recently have developed an addiction to anything Jane Austen, especially anything to do with Pride and Predjudice.  While I prefer the A&E production as opposed to the more recent verison, I prefer this soundtrack over the A&E verison.  The lilting melodies bring back memories of the movie but are also very soothing after a hard day at work.  I listen to it on my way to work to peacfully begin my day and then on the way home to relax my mind after a long day.  I have enjoyed listening to the piano forte solos \\"immensely\\" (Jane Austen's influence).
B00012QM8G|5.0|I waited to watch this movie because of the difficult subject matter.  I had a hard time at the Holocaust Museum in DC and thought this film would be a similar heartbreaking and sickening experience.  It was not.  The random executions and dehumanizing treatment were rough to watch, it's true, but the story itself is a happy one with a mostly happy ending.  Hard to believe that one man could make such a difference, and the included documentary that features survivors' interviews is a nice companion piece.  One other thing:  there seem to be invented dramatic moments in the story (a train accidentally rerouted to Auschwitz, a group of prisoners herded into the showers).  While watching the documentary, I discovered that these climactic moments were lifted directly from the true story, and not fabricated to advance the plot or strengthen conflict.

B00000DRWB|2.0|Toys in the Attic is an overrated, overplayed disaster. <br /> <br />The only decent songs are the title track and \\"Uncle Salty\\".  \\"Walk This Way\\" has a unique vocal melody for the time it was released in the mid 70's, but that doesn't mean I like it.  \\"Big Ten Inch\\" sounds like some fake novelty song that wears thin after a couple listens. <br /> <br />\\"Sweet Emotion\\" is a decent song, but the live versions are MUCH better because the song demands a lot of energy, which this studio version lacks.  \\"No More No More\\" is Aerosmith's version of a pop song, and an unmemorable one at that.  \\"Round and Round\\" is a rip-off of Black Sabbath's \\"Sweet Leaf\\" and for some reason, a hard rock band thought it was a good idea to end an album with a ballad called \\"You See My Crying\\", complete with overdramatic emotions that sound forced and unreal. <br /> <br />Aerosmith is a pretty fantastic band, but Get Your Wings is the place to start.  Or buy that live album released in the late 70's.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I'm almost wishing Linkin Park posts a message on their Myspace page, telling its fans that this album was a delayed April Fools Joke, and the real album will come out this summer.  Please, will you tell me that's the case?!?  This album sounds like the MANY weak B-sides Linkin Park has recorded over the years.  Minimal rapping, non-catchy songs, that bare almost no resemblance to the Linkin Park most of us have come to know and love.<br /><br />Reading an article with Chester back about 6 months ago, I knew that this album was going to be terrible.  He seemed to be extremely bitter with the way LP was received, and wanted to throw everyone a monkey wrench with this album.  Well, you did, Chester.  Instead of everyone praising Linkin Park for another great album, the majority of people are talking about how terrible it is.  You got your wish, my man.<br /><br />For anyone who hasn't bought this album yet, you're probably going to be frustrated with the new direction, unless you're the type of person who likes ANYTHING if you listen to it enough times.  Unfortunately, there are many people who will say, \\"The album will grow on you after a few listens!\\"  If you're that kind of person, then bless your soul.  I can listen to any disgraceful song on the radio enough times and learn the lyrics, but it doesn't mean it's a good song.  This album won't be good, no matter how many listens you give it, or how hard you try to like it because it's Linkin Park.  It's truly a very bad album, and much like the new Evanescence album, I'm extremely disappointed with it.
B00005AREQ|5.0|I don't know much about Jeff Beck.  I know he's listed as a highly innovative guitarist with a distinct sound, and that Rod Stewart used to be the lead singer in the older version of his band.  I also know he's supposedly a hard person to get along with, which explains all the lineup changes over the years.  Ritchie Blackmore had the same problem with the band Rainbow.  No two Rainbow albums are alike because of that.    Anyway, since I know very little about this underrated guitar genius, I told myself \\"It's time to buy something... how about Blow By Blow?\\"  Good choice?  Yes!  I also had friends who helped influence my decision to check out his stuff.    Let's be completely honest- even though \\"Freeway Jam\\" and \\"You Know What I Mean\\" are the popular songs on the album, you won't hear those songs on regular FM radio.  Maybe back in the day, when this album was brand new, those songs would be played.  No longer, unfortunately.    Really, my impression of Beck based on this experience was a very guitar-dominated album, with the occasional touches of slow blues, but mostly focusing on lengthy jams.  There are some moments of funk and jazz, but those don't happen very often.      It's definitely not a typical guitar instrumental album, because of Beck's talent for throwing in dazzling little touches here and there.  I actually love the music though, and repeated listens reveals a very spectacular and worthy album overall.
B000NA77YO|4.0|BLACK SABBATH: The DIO Years is a greatest hits compilation covering material from all three of the studio albums that Ronnie James Dio created with Sabbath, the 1982 \\"Live Evil\\" live album, plus three new songs that Ronnie, Tony, Geezer, and Vinnie put out (mainly to promote the new cd and their world wide Heaven and Hell tour). To my knowledge, this is Sabbath's 5th greatest hits album (correct me if I'm wrong), after \\"We Sold Our Souls\\", \\"The Sabbath Stones\\", \\"Symptom of the Universe\\", and 1970-1978 Greatest Hits\\". While I usually choose not to bother with greatest hits, because A:} greatest hit's cds usually do not represent the band accurately and B:} because I most likely own all the albums that the hit's contain, this collection of 16 gems caught my eye (really I was just interested in the three newbies and the remastered sound). Dio Years is a good hits collection, easily not a great one. I mean, most die-hards probably already own Heaven and Hell, Mob Rules, and Dehumanizer, which is 13/17 songs right there. The only songs that may be new are obviously the 3 new recordings and maybe Children of the Sea (live), if some fans side-stepped \\"Live Evil\\". Still, if you're one of those people that needs EVERY CD that a band puts out (studio, live, and greatest hits), then this won't be disappointing to you rare breeds.<br /><br />SOUND:} Incredible, powerful, very much appreciated, and amped-up sound quality! Some don't seem to think so, but the select few songs on this CD have definitely been remastered, in some way, shape, or form. Now, I haven't heard the versions on the '87, '96, or '00 remasters of...oh...let's say Heaven and Hell, but going by the 1990 release (which is also the most common), the songs on here have more volume and power. For an example, I'm a drummer, so the first thing I listened for were the drums; and let me tell you, Ward's and Vinnie's drum sound has without-a-doubt been remastered. The bass drum is a lot thicker and gives a more OMPH!, so who can complain about that.  Geezer's bass is also more dominant and audible than before, but it doesn't overlay the guitar or vocals so that's good. Lastly, Tony's guitar and Ronnie's iron pipes haven't really been touched, to my ears anyways, but the volume has definitely been cranked up. In short, the sound of this disc is a huge improvement over the original versions, but the remastering doesn't ruin the authenticity of the songs or anything.  Don't expect to be blown away, just know that the songs have been changed a bit.<br /><br />NEW SONGS:} The Devil Cried, Shadow of the Wind, and Ear in the Wall are the three new tracks off this disc. \\"Devil Cried\\" is a medium-paced song, that contains a mid-tempo, catchy riff from Tony, and a sweet, driving drum section from Vinnie all the way through. Dio's voice, to me, is fantastic and phenomenal, reminding me of his \\"Master of the Moon\\" voice, menacing, dark, and ever so heavy. This song is the worst out of the three, but still very enjoyable. Iommi naturally dishes out a kick-butt solo that rocks hard, and Geezer keeps plucking on his bass, as well. Next up is \\"Shadow of the Wind\\", which  is the slowwww new song more reminiscent of material off...again, \\"Master of the Moon\\" than anything else. Still, very haunting complete with that creeping riff that Tony can do so well and Dio's amazing n powerful voice (especially at the chorus) carrying the song along. My personal second favorite that is a gem to be treasured. Last, but not least, \\"Ear in the Wall\\" closes off this disc. This rocker is easily the best of the three. Headbangin' opening riff that reminds me a lot of their earlier stuff from the early 80's complementing Ronnie's well-ranged pipes, creating humorous images about...you guessed it...an ear in the wall! Great way to end off the album and a great addition to the compilation. Really, the songs won't leave you awestruck and they're far from groundbreaking (so don't get your hopes up), but like I said, they rock a lot harder than most crap out there these days.<br /><br />PACKAGING:} One disc containing 16 songs (5 from Heaven and Hell, 4 songs from Mob Rules, 1 live cut from Live Evil, and 3 never-before-released songs) in a jewel case with a shiny paper sleeve. Worthwhile, lengthy booklet giving a descriptive account of the band from 1980-present.  Noteworthy, classic and new alike artwork, also.<br /><br />SET LIST:} For a greatest hit's, the song listing on here is pretty good. Most compilations fail miserably in representing the band featured, but DIO YEARS did ok. Now Dio only had three studio albums with the band, so it was probably easier to choose songs, but there are definitely some problems with the set list. For one thing, where in God's holy name is \\"Sign of the Southern Cross\\"? That's easily my second favorite Dio Sabbath song and a fan fav, so why the omission? I don't have the answer, my guess would either be they wanted to \\"surprise\\" the fans with a silly new twist or maybe the band chose not to have it for personal reasons. Don't ask me. Also, I would have omitted Lonely is the Word for almost any other song from their albums. Other than those HUGE, HUGE mess-ups it's pretty good. However, my set list, if you're interested, would have gone like so...<br /><br />>Neon Knights, Children of the Sea (live), Lady Evil, Heaven and Hell, Wishing Well, and Die Young > the six best songs off Heaven and Hell, plus a great live representation of the band, and all the fan favorites.<br /><br />>Turn Up the Night, Voodoo (live), Sign of the Southern Cross, Mob Rules, Country Girl, and Falling Off the Edge of the World > Also the six best songs off the album, and again another live representative for them.<br /><br />>Computer God (where the heck was that gem), After All (the Dead), TV Crimes, and I (also it would be sweet if one of those songs were a live rarity from the vault or something; that'd be amazing).<br /><br />>Finally, the three new songs to close off the album and to make it 20 songs, maybe a rare or never-before-released bonus track from an early session. How cool would that be?<br /><br />I know this review was lengthy, but I have tons of time on my hands, and I just wanted to talk about this album, so you can know more about it. I realize every hardcore Sabbath fan probably has all of these songs already, but the three new ones are great (no, not worth the price alone like some people said...geesh), and the remastering couldn't be better. Also, it's cool if you're old-fashioned like me and still lug around a cd-player when you wanna just listen to the goods on one compact disc. My final say would be to get this used (like new) and keep listening to the biggest band in metal!<br /><br />p.s. check out joe's review above.

B00005JPPI|4.0|While somewhat predictable, Fracture is saved by great acting, from Anthony Hopkins, Ryan Gossling and all the supporting actors. Rosamund Pike is a lovely actress I want to see again and David Straithairn is always a pleasure to watch (I wish this fantastic actor would get the chance to do more movies). Enjoying Fracture requires suspending your disbelief on occasion, but overall it's a pretty enjoyable movie.
B00005JPFF|5.0|Spider-Man is here for a third time and the cinematic trilogy is in the books. Comparing Spider-Man 3 to the previous two films, this is not as good as the first but better than the second. Letting this third film stand alone, it is fantastic. It can't be rated the same standing in the first movie's shadow.<br /><br />Peter Parker is threatened by more than one enemy (the Sandman, Venom, and the new Goblin), while juggling his love life and dealing with a strange black substance changing his ways and temptations. Seeing Parker make the transition from city hero to rebellious icon is a great change of pace for this series. It's different and even humorous (see: numerous dance scenes).<br /><br />At times, Spider-Man 3 can be somewhat corny, but the action, drama, and humor most certainly make up for it. Expect to be entertained!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I recently purchased this series from Amazon.com. This is a great, little known series. The D.V.D.'s arrived on time and in great condition.

B00004Y6NW|4.0|Dire Straits is a band that would form in the late 1970s   Throughout their career, Dire Straits, they would do things much differently than many of the other bands during the \\"British Invasion\\" that was taking place.   In an era where Punk and New Wave were taking center stage, Dire Straits were doing things the old-fashioned way:  a combination of Classic Rock, Blues, Folk, and even some Country.  In latter years, Dire Straits would migrate toward more complex and progressive arrangements and somewhere along the way they would become pop stars.   However, the early days of Dire Straits would demonstrate their roots around Classic Rock, Blues, Folk, and Country.    Their debut album - the self-titled \\"Dire Straits\\" demonstrates a simpler, more-stripped down sound than what they would eventually become known for.  In a lot of was, they were the anti-thesis of the stereotypical British Invasion band of the 1970s.  This album would also demonstrate some clever songwriting - all by Mark Knopfler. <br /> <br />For the most part, Dire Straits is the brainchild of its lead guitarist and vocalist - Mark Knopfler.   Throughout his career, Knopfler would assemble a group of musicians that would comprise Dire Straits.   This self-titled album consisted of Mark Knopfler on vocals and lead guitars,  his brother David - also on guitars, John Illsley (who would be the only constant throughout the life of Dire Straits besides Mark Knopfler) on bass, and Pick Withers on drums.   On latter albums, Dire Straits would demonstrate more use of the keyboards (for example Roy Bittan would add a new dimension by playing keyboards on the \\"Making Movies\\" album), but for now Dire Straits would mostly focus around a guitar-oriented sound. <br /> <br />As for the lyrics, Mark Knopfler does some of his best songwriting on this collection.  I like how he makes use of metaphors and storytelling. <br /> <br />Here is a track by track review of this collection: <br /> <br />\\"Down to the Waterline\\":This song demonstrates the Classic Rock influence.  In a lot of ways, this being the first track on the first Dire Straits album would become a prototype of a good chunk of Dire Straits sound.   That sound would consist of the classic guitar grooves Mark Knopfler and company would become known for.   It would also be a blueprint for the unique vocals delivered by Mark Knopfler.   Overall, while this is the first song it probably remains one of the band's best. <br /> <br />\\"Water of Love\\": The theme of \\"water\\" continues on to the second track.   The guitar work on this one reminds me a bit of Lindsay Buckingham from Fleetwood Mac, but also has a Folk-Rock feel.  Mark Knopfler does a good, yet simple job at using metaphors in this song.  \\"High and dry on a long hot day.....I need a little water of love\\".   The chorus is also very catchy on this song. <br /> <br />\\"Setting Me Up\\":  On this song, the sound begins to move toward more of a Country type of sound.   Country would be something that Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler would demonstrate throughout their careers.   This song is as a-typical of a British Invasion song as you will hear, yet the band pulls it off flawlessly. <br /> <br />\\"Six Blade Knife\\": The opening guitars of this sound are terrific.  You can almost \\"see\\" the Knopfler brothers plucking away on the strings of the guitar.  While this isn't the strongest track, it still is a very good track because of how good the guitar work is.  Mark Knopfler again uses metaphors - \\"Your six blade knife can do anything for you....one blade for breaking my heart; one blade for tearing me apart.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Southbound Again\\":  This song not only showed me the country sound, but it also showed me a Southern Rock influence.   The guitar work and vocals gave me a feeling that this was an Allman Brothers Band song.   Like \\"Six Blade Knife\\", it is going to be the guitar work that will be the ultimate strength of this track. <br /> <br />\\"Sultans of Swing\\":  This wouldbecome a legendary song and put Dire Straits on the map.  Along with 1985's \\"Money For Nothing\\", it is a signature song for the band.  In this song, Mark Knopfler tells the story of a bunch of working class guys who want to play their own unique jazz sound in a London club.   We are introduced to two of those guys - \\"Guitar George\\" and \\"Harry\\".   While Knopfler does a great job with the lyrics, it will be the combination of the Knopfler brothers on guitar and Illsley on bass that will help supplement this terrific narrative. <br /> <br />\\"In the Gallery\\":  While \\"Southbound Again\\" gave me a feeling for the Allman Brothers Band, this song virtually had me believing this was the Allmans.   This song has the combination of Blues and Southern Rock that became an Allmans trademark.   In this song we are introduced to another \\"Harry\\".  Unlike the working-class \\"Harry\\" in \\"Sultans of Swing\\", this one is an artist who works in \\"Clay and Stone\\". <br /> <br />\\"Wild West End\\":  While I wouldn't say this song has a \\"Cowboy\\" sound, it still has a very good sound.  More guitar work where you can virtually \\"see\\" each individual string being played.   This song has a nice chorus too. <br /> <br />\\"Lions\\": This song has a classic 70s rock sound. \\"Lions\\" are used as metaphors again.  \\"Drunk old soldier he gives her a fight; he's a crazy lion howling for a fight\\".  This song is slowly grew on me - I can see why fans really like it. <br /> <br />The liner notes contain all of the lyrics to it.  This is the album where it all began for Dire Straits.  You can hear how Dire Straits - and in particular Mark Knopfler would lay the foundation for the next 3 decades of music.    While \\"Sultans of Swing\\" may be the best known song, there should plenty of other songs on this collection that will appeal. Highly recommended.
1594200823|2.0|This is truly typical of the journalist that studies something and far too early in the game considers himself a World Authority. In this case he studied it long enough to become familiar with the terms but not to the point of actually knowing what all of them were, or hoping the reader doesn't. He uses compounds like citric and ascorbic acid and lecithin to instill terror into the omnivore's heart and, I suspect, would have us all become vegan organic farmers.  <br /> <br />Nice try, noble goal, but get real. Better nutrition by terror is an old, hackneyed theme. I actually think the author cares a lot more about making a bunch of money by selling his book than educating consumers about their food choices. If you don't already know what ascorbic acid is, do yourself a big favor and steer clear of this book.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I got into Interpol by seeing them at a few festivals in 2004... and after they joined the Curiosa festival I was hooked.  They are an amazing band, and if this isn't a perfect first album, I don't know what is.  And they keep getting better and better.   <br /> <br />I just saw them in Las Vegas and they did about four of their new songs off the upcoming album - and everything sounds fabulous!  This is going to be a great year for this band.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|so do you'r self a faver,if you you hav'nt seen this yet will you are missing out on a darn good film/DVD.[[ASIN:B000MNP2KI Casino Royale (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)]]
B00005K3NR|5.0|The only flaw of this Brian Depalma vehicle is...dare I say this...the story? Yup, telekinetic devil child? It's certainly not boring but I almost can't possibly grant it a five star rating.  I'm going to anyway. King's first novel is not his best, but it is still very good. I will assert that the film is actually better and Carrie is one of the best adaptations of a King novel ever made into a film. My hats off to Depalma for creating one of the scariest films of all time in the process. I'm a huge horror fan, so Carrie has quite a few things to take into account for your own tastes. It's a bit dated and requires some imagination from the viewer...I'm probably preaching the quire here anyway.<br /><br />Most people my age have only seen the edited television version which is on about three or four times every Halloween. The made for television remake was a horrorshow in a different way because it came close to ruining the credibility of its original. Depalma holds back his amazing technical abilities intentionally and builds this tale of revenge and justice up for one of the most climatic sequences ever made. \\"They're all gonna laugh at you\\" rings in Carrie's ears after a bucket of pig's blood is dropped on her head...the music goes from extremely happy and glorious to tense and terrifying, the lighting goes from normal to blood red like Carries now blood soaked appearance. We go from feeling sorry for her to feeling sorry for the kids who we thought for one minute might deserve what's coming to them in a few moments. What follows is quite possible the most brilliantly filmed horror sequence ever. Split screening and panning from Sissy Spacek's amazingly tense eyes and face to her victims soon to be lifeless bodies. Then the fire comes in and we realize that these kids have unknowingly unleashed hell on earth. The film keeps going down a very dark road and doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Anyway, it's one of the greatest horror films of all time and is totally unforgettable. In the long run its films that you remember fully that stay intact as classics and Carrie is certainly one of them.forgettable. In the long run its films that you remember fully that stay intact as classics and Carrie is certainly one of them.  <br />

B000OCXFCO|5.0|This album is non stop heavy crunching metal.  From the first song to the last, this album shreds.  One of Megadeth's best albums by far!!<br /><br />The guitar work explodes right off the cd.  Guitar solos abound and Mustaine's voice is perfectly blended with the music.  The mix is so clean that you can hear each instrument clearly.<br /><br />This is metal at its best.  This album is what Metallica's St. Anger should've been.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|\\"They've grown with their music.\\"  It's used so much now that it's become a cliché.  But Linkin Park really has grown up as evident with this album.  The old screaming and angst LP of Hybrid Theory has been replaced with a calmer more adult themed ballad style.  There are still a few hopping tracks, but many of the better songs are slower and more relaxed. <br /> <br />1. Wake - Simply an intro to what's to follow <br />2. Given Up - This is one of the two \\"hard\\" tracks.  Sounds very grunge. My least fav <br />3. Leave Out All The Rest - Very good slow track.   <br />4. Bleed It Out - This is like \\"Faint\\" very up tempo and a fun song <br />5. Shadow of the Day - If this was just played on the radio I would never believe this was LP. Another slow type song.  But Chester's voice is still recognizable. <br />6. What I've Done - You've heard it. Their first single from the album <br />7. Hands Held High - I was never Shinoda's biggest fan when he rapped, but this song is amazing.  If you liked the rapping on \\"Where'd you go\\" you'll like this for sure.  But this has a message and is very good.  Surprising, this is my fav on the record. <br />8. No More Sorrow - Good opening.  Then it sounds almost like Metallica.  In fact, until Chester begins to sing, this would fit on any Metallica album.   <br />9. Valentine's Day - A love lost?  Another slow, but good song. <br />10. In Between - Mike Shinoda qusi singing and rapping?  I didn't care for this one. <br />11. In Pieces - Begins slow and it's a bore until the guitar comes in during the second verse and it picks up a bit. <br />12. The Little Things Give You Away - wrote about the Katrina flooding.  <br /> <br />All in all, not a bad album.  You'll have to keep an open mind when playing it through the first time because it isn't what you'd expect.  They have grown up on this album, but I'd like to think we all have too.   <br />
B000M4RG42|4.0|Flags of our Fathers sheds light on the soldiers that raised the American flag at the Battle of Iwo Jima during WWII.  Most people will agree that even in that seemingly straightforward occasion there's more than meets the eye... <br />In short, the special effects are great, the music is very good, the acting is pretty good, the plot/setting is very interesting (GREAT if you are a history buff), while the dialogues are average. <br />On the negative side and as others have also pointed out, further character development was needed. <br />In a nutshell, though not a masterpiece it will provide for an evening's entertainment.  <br />
B000OCXMAE|2.0|i could not believe my ears when i put the cd in yesterday. nothing even close to what i was expecting from LP. total letdown imo. only 3 maybe 4 good rock songs on here and the rest sounds like lullabyes he is trying to sing his kid for bedtime. if you are a diehard LP fan and expecting something close to hybrid theory, you are going to be in shock.
B00005LC1H|5.0|It's John Cleese and this was just totally worth purchasing!
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I never buy cds, I always download them, but Linkin Park is an exception. Hands down my favorite band, so I rushed off on May 15 to buy their cd and wow...a HUGE dissapointment. Not even a dissapointment a huge let down. I wouldn't have even known this was Linkin Park if I heard it on the radio (besides What I've Done). Trust me! Download a few of their songs and I'm sure you will change your mind about buying their cd. This could be very well the end of Linkin Park, unless they get their ____ together!
B00005R1N3|5.0|I saw this movie on HBO in the late 1970's, as a kid, under the above listed title.  This one is well worth the watch.  I have watched horror movies my whole life and can honestly say that very few genuinely scared me as much as this one.  (Yes, Halloween and The Exorcist were also very scary the first go 'round, but this movie affected as much as either of these movies).  It may be that nowadays the plot has been repeated ad nauseam but I still feel that the impact of this movie is  viable.  You will not see gore, so you will have to use your imagination. That is a good thing.  Your imagination is far more disturbing than any gore onscreen.  The antagonist, whoever did the voice, is fantastic.  He really sounds crazy, and not in a good way, either.
B0006B2A42|4.0|Sure this movie falters when it hits the ice because of being shot on sets instead of location but, thats the way it used to be done and, if you let yourself go you wont mind. The story up to that point is completely engrossing and believable! Actually the scenes on the ice are tricky enough to have made me forget that it was on a set! Get the popcorn and just Enjoy this adventure!!!  IT'S FUN!!! It's Rock Hudson, Ernest Borgnine ,Jim Brown etc.!!!
B0006L0LOS|2.0|This movie takes a long time to even get to where it's suppose to go.  And honestly, I sort of enjoyed some of the cheesy dating scenes with Berry and Bratt.  The whole let's sell toxic beauty cream is laughable.  Why didn't she just turn in a jar of the stuff to the authorities or a newpaper organization???  But Berry does look good in her suit.  I'll give her that.  Stone looks good, though her acting is less than steller.  But it looks like everyone agrees that the number one problem with Catwoman is the script.  Was this written by a first time screenwriter?  Save your money.  I caught it on a slow cable night.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Although I've liked Wilco before now, and do enjoy YFH and Summerteeth, I always sensed an underlying identity problem with Tweedy and his band. Not that THEY didn't know who they were, but rather, I was having a difficult time interpreting who they were. The critically acclaimed Yankee Foxtrot Hotel never really captured me the way it did so many others. The Radiohead comparison's always flew right over my head...I never understood how the Tweedy from Uncle Tupelo would ever create something as abstract as to warrant such comparisons. And strangely, I never understood all of this so well until I listened to Sky Blue Sky. <br /> <br />This album, to me, sounds much more like Tweedy in his natural state, his comfort zone if you will. I'm all for experimentation and branching out, but YFH, at least to me, sounded out of character and forced. I understand that maybe that's my problem, since I seem to be in the vast minority. But when I listen to Sky Blue Sky, I feel like THIS is Wilco, THIS is Jeff Tweedy, in its purest form. This feels as though it's straight from the heart and soul, moreso than any other Wilco release. <br /> <br />I really don't understand what people are missing from this album. Is it too mellow? Is it too straightforward? Is it not challenging enough? <br /> <br />I love challenging bands. But Wilco isn't about challenging. Wilco, to me, is about homegrown, heartfelt, wear-your-feelings-on-your-sleeve songwriting. <br /> <br />There are a lot of different things to like on this album. The Bonham like drumming on \\"Hate it Here,\\" the faint Pink Floyd influence on \\"Shake it Off,\\" the brilliant guitar work by Nils, the brilliant but simple and completely relatable lyrics. I listen to Sky Blue Sky and I feel like I'm hanging out in a bar with a bunch of friends talking about the days events, with the occasional bust out laughing moments and occasional sentimental teary-eyed moments. And I feel as comfortable as ever. <br /> <br />This is the perfect summer evening, chill-out album. <br /> <br />And I just have to mention, \\"On and on and on\\" is the best song I've heard all year.
B0000VD04M|5.0|We're sometimes tempted to view Ed Wood as a failure. After all, the man was voted the Worst Director of All Time, and his \\"masterpiece\\"--Plan 9 From Outer Space--was once voted Worst Film. It makes the character of Wood pitiable, because he tries so very hard, and doesn't see how talentless he really is. <br /> <br />On the other hand... <br /> <br />Wood did (more or less) what he set out to do. He made films. Not only that, but he wrote them, directed them, and starred in them (like his rolemodel Welles). While Mr. Wood is gone, he also lives on; Johnny Depp played him in a film, and people continue to buy and rent his collection. Whether or not Wood was a good director (and he wasn't), he lived his life as he wanted to live it and he found more success than most of us ever will. I think that Ed Wood is a testament to the power of believing in yourself, and never giving up on your dreams no matter the odds you face. <br /> <br />This film presents that story in all of its richness, whether you ultimately find Wood's character uplifting or laughable. Depp is brilliant, like he normally is: have we ever seen him the same in different films (excluding sequels)? After watching Depp as Wood, it's hard to imagine that anyone else would even have been considered. Lots of people have commented on the genius performance of Martin Landau. I'll make one more. Absolute genius. In this movie, Landau *becomes* Lugosi. It feels real, like you're there, watching Bela Lugosi. Incredible. The other roles, bigger and smaller, all come off. Excellent casting, filling the roles up with big-name actors, but never as a gimmick. Even the casting of former pro-wrestler George \\"the Animal\\" Steele is inspired. (One of my favorite moments is when Sarah Jessica Parker \\"acts\\" in one of Wood's films; nothing like a superbly talented actress demonstrating what poor acting looks like.) <br /> <br />One of Burton's best films. One of Depp's best films. Landau's best. A feel-good triumph. Five Stars.
0375831002|5.0|This is the best book I have ever listened to. I'm so glad I got it in audio format instead of reading it! I recommend it be listened to, even if you've read it. Allan Corduner narrates with perfect inflections and his accent is very good. The story is told very creatively, with a simple lyricism. Death is so convincing. Leisl is so refreshing. The characters are very believable; you feel you know them. We're lead through an intense chapter of history with so little joy, yet there is hope. That is Death's message. This is a story for all ages, not just young adults. It would make a fantastic discussion book. I know I'll listen to it again and again.
B00000612P|5.0|Folks. Your favorite Seer (me), despite my grandiose aspirations for Nirvanic pefection, can get himself in really dumb situations. Chance,  my sometimes morose guide (who teaches movie stars how to scowl) came by and suggested that I needed a change. So he had a stylist come in to war against my long grey hair. People. I could cry. I wound up with a rooster cut and, not only that, but now it's blond! How can I go to a Seer's convention looking like this? And I can't tame this hair. I bought exotic spray (with ingredients from the figi islands), minty fresh laquer, and jell made from grapes- and nothing - absolutely nothing affects this hair at all! I must have combed it in a thousand ways-but it came out lookig just the same. However, I am a Rod Stewart look alike now without that incredible voice. You should hear me sing - sounds like sqeeks. I do a mean mousetone folks!<br /><br />Anyway, Rod, on this album, secures and deserves his legacy no matter what age has done to him. In this he is the ultimate rocker, the soulful crooner, the balladeer all rolled into one. And, let's not forget those vocals. Gritty and wonderful and one of a kind.<br /><br />The thing that strikes me most about this album is the wise choice of songs and the ability to really create \\"live\\" sound. It sounds like they are playing in your living room and this makes the music sound alive and real.<br /><br />We begin with \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\" which is Rod at his finest, rockin' rave best. Even the break in this song is picture perfect. Then on to that slow soulful piano ballad \\"Seems Like a Long Time\\" with the essential female backing vocals. Listen to how the chorus gets insistent near the end and then goes back down to the beginning sparse arrangement. So superb.<br /><br />Wonderful slide guitar and the band in fine, soulful swing with \\"That's All Right\\". All the instruments groove on this one. Then the acoustic, beautiful \\"Tomorrow is a Long Time\\" with tasty guitar and fiddle and aching vocals by Rod. I should point out that he secured some extremely talented musicians for this project. The unity of playing is prominent with the joy of hearing all contributions so crisp and clear.<br /><br />The acoustic beginning of \\"Maggie May\\" reminds me of when I went back in time to King Arthur's court. It was during a big feast. I remember getting sick on the wine.  Anyway, the song is about the love of a young man and an older woman.  I'm sure you have all heard this classic by now. But, as an aside, your Metamorpho has personally tried to make a living out of playing pool and it was not pretty. They almost broke my thumbs.<br /><br />Then we have \\"Mandolin Wind\\" with beautiful mandolins and slide guitar. Again, how sweet this song begins and then moves towards a crest. Rod knows what he's doing. He offers the gritty syrup and then belts us with sheer gravel. What a mason he is.<br /><br />\\"(I Know) I'm Losing You\\" is a great version of that soulful tune. Aside from the great beat, Rod treats us to a meaningful, expert vocal, brimming with emotion and desperation. His interpretation of this song is right on target.<br /><br />He ends the album with Tim Hardin's \\"Reason to Believe\\". Beautiful. You can hear the ache of a man who has lost faith but still wants to find a shred of that faith in order to have some meaning in life. Absolutely so well done.<br /><br />In closing, the peaks and valleys of this album resonate long after you hear it. It is so well thought out and the order is an inspiration. This is classic Rod Stewart. His career may have had peaks and valleys as well. But this one stands on the highest peak. A classic - and so good to hear instruments that have a real sound.<br /><br />That's all for now people. Now, don't feel too badly for me. Warmer weather is coming so I'm going to buzz cut my hair and then put on my seer's hat. If that doesn't work I can get my orange clown wig out of storage. The future, after all, belongs to the clever.<br /><br />Yours, from the French Bank ------MetamorphoMetamorpho <br />
0307263118|5.0|The Sea is a marvel of efficiency; in less than 200 pages, Banville writes a \\"memoir\\" that is spare and yet touching and profound.<br /><br />The Sea is the story of a rapidly aging widower who, after the death of his wife, travels to the seaside resort town where he spent several summers as a child. Taking up residence in a long term boarding house filled with other hurting and lost souls, he thinks about his life; first his childhood summers and the life defining relationship and events of those years, then the days preceding and during his wife's illness and death, and then finally the unkind truth of his present life. These narratives are weaved together throughout the novel until they coalesce towards the end.<br /><br />I could ramble on for a while about how much I liked this book, how true Banville's observations rung, how deep the sense of loss is, how scary it makes one feel about getting old. I could, but you should just buy the book and experience it for yourself.<br /><br />Banville won the Mann Booker prize for The Sea.  Some quotes:<br /><br />\\"On the subject of observing and being observed, I must mention the long grim gander I took at myself in the bathroom mirror this morning. Usually these days I do not dally before my reflection any longer than is necessary. There was a time when I quite liked what I saw in the looking-glass, but not any more. Now I am startled, and more than startled, by the visage that so abruptly appears there, never and not at all the one that I expect. I have been elbowed aside by a parody of myself, a sadly disheveled figure in a Hallowe'en mask made of sagging pinkish -grey rubber that bears no more than a passing resemblance to the image of what I look like that I stubbornly retain in my head.\\"<br /><br />\\"When we arrived I marveled to see how much of the village as I remembered it was still here, if only for eyes that knew where to look, mine, that is. It was like encountering an old flame behind whose features thickenedby age the slender lineaments that a former self so loved can still be clearly discerned.\\"<br /><br />\\"I looked aside quickly for fear my eyes would give me away; one's eyes are always those of someone else, the mad and desperate dwarf crouched within. I knew what she meant. This was not supposed to have befallen her. It was not supposed to have befallen us, we were not that kind of people. Misfortune, illness, untimely death, these things happen to good folk, the humble ones, the salt of the earth, not to Anna, not to me.\\"<br /><br />\\"I recalled walking in the street with Anna one day after all her hair had fallen out and she spotted passing by on the pavement a woman who was also bald. I do not know if Anna caught me catching the look they exchanged, the two of them, blank-eyed and at the same time sharp, sly, complicit. In all that endless twelvemonth of her illness I do not think I ever felt more distant from her than I did at that moment, elbowed aside by the sorority of the afflicted.\\"<br /><br />\\"[my daughter] understands me to a degree that is disturbing and will not indulge my foibles and excesses as others do who know me less and therefore fear me more. But I am bereaved and wounded and require indulging. If there is a long version of shrift, then that is what I am in need of. Let me alone, I cried at her in my mind, let me creep past the traduced old Cedars, past the vanished Strand Caf&eacute;, past the Lupins and the Field that was, past all this past for if I stop I shall surely dissolve in a shaming puddle of tears.\\"<br /><br />\\"Have I spoken already of my drinking? I drink like a fish. No, not like a fish, fishes do not drink, it is only breathing, their kind of breathing. I drink like one recently widowed-widowered? - a person of scant talent and scanter ambition, greyed o'er by the years, uncertain and astray and in need of consolation and the brief respite of drink-induced oblivion. I would take drugs if I had them, but I have not, and do not know how I might go about getting some.\\"
B00005R62N|5.0|In 1979, there was no band heavier than Judas Priest! Motorhead and AC/DC were worthy contenders, but only Lemmy's boys came close to ripping your head off like Priest at the end of the '70's. A live testament is usually a metal bands claim to faim and the boys produced a whopper in 'Unleashed in the East' in October of said year. In many ways, this record was the ultimate greatest hits package as classics from 'Sad Wings' ran alongside the best of their Columbia Records years to date. \\"Sinner\\" is long, gothic and majestic, possibly KK Downing's best moment on record. \\"Exciter\\" roars out of the gates and \\"The Ripper\\" is a full frontal assault on the senses. \\"Green Manalishi\\" was a Peter Green's Mac blues tune but with added metallic power and here it blows away both the Mac's and Priest's own studio version. \\"Tyrant\\" was a fantastic way to end the original album but my one quibble would be that with all of the classics from 'Sad Wings' (cept for \\"Ripper\\" which is flawless)and especially \\"Victim of Changes\\" (my all-time favorite by Priest!), the tempo is too fast. I appreciate the studio cuts more which had a classic Sabbathesque feel, but again it is a minor quibble. Also, one song from 'Stained Class', a album many consider to be the Metal Gods finest hour in the studio, is not enough. Bonus cuts are for once in this terrible remasters series (with the bonus songs that is) an absolute must as each song is special and perfectly chosen (special nod to \\"Delivering the Goods\\" and of course \\"Hell Bent for Leather\\", to of my all timers). As to what ever doctoring the band did to this record before release....who gives a crap! Mention any great live record of the last thirty plus years and chances are they have significant overdubs! Halford rerecorded his vocals? God bless him! That what makes Priest so great and on a winter night in Japan, they melted some faces!
B000001H00|5.0|Imagine hearing this recording of Nathan Milstein playing Bach's Chaconne over the sound system of the San Francisco Opera House!  The San Francisco Ballet used this recording for the piece \\"Artifact Suite\\" for Muriel Maffre's Farewell Gala on May 6, 2007.  The only way to describe the beauty of Milstein's performance is \\"heavenly\\".  Such a musical treat on top of an evening of world-class dance was an unexpected delight.
1400064287|5.0|It's not often that a business book is well written, well organized, and drives home a critical message.  Made to Stick does it all.  From the engaging (\\"sticky\\") introduction that I find myself reciting to my colleagues repeatedly (I guarantee you will remember it), to the very practical almost check-list simple advice, Made to Stick should be required reading for any executive who needs to get their message across.  The Brother's Heath, do a terrific job of providing compelling anecdotal evidence for how their lessons can impact all forms of business (and perhaps life's) communications.  If you are someone who needs to pursuade, lead, or just communicate, you owe it to yourself to buy this book.  I've already read it twice and likely will again.
1582701709|5.0|This booked has helped me to change my focus and have a broader perspective on opportunites in all areas of my life.  I know that I can attract whatever circumstance, person, opportunity that I want to to help me get to where I want to be.  It helped me to realize that I have done this before in my life to achieve goals that I had. <br /> <br />The book is uplifting and holds promises for the type of life you want to live.  It gives you the tools to bring this about. <br /> <br />Thanks to Rhonda Byrne.  Many of my freinds are reading this and listening to the book on CD daily.  Very uplifting.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|All of the folks who left negative reviews must not have heard the same album I listened to. Amarantine is quite possible my favorite Enya album, though [[ASIN:B000002N3N The Memory of Trees]] is another strong candidate. For me, Enya is a guilty pleasure. I primarily enjoy progressive rock and roll and jazz-fusion, but Enya's music offers just enough for me to escape from time to time. <br /> <br />The song writing in Amarantine feels much tighter than in [[ASIN:B000050XEI A Day Without Rain]]. I have two favorite tracks on this album: \\"It's In The Rain\\" and \\"The River Sings.\\" The former is reminiscent to me of some of her work from the [[ASIN:B000002LRR Watermark]] album, while the latter provides an excellent rhythm that evokes mental scenes of Celtic dancers. <br /> <br />I highly enjoy this album and I listen to it fairly often. If you enjoy all of Enya's music (as I do), you will enjoy this album.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|This new Bond movie is different alright -- different in a worst possible way.  All the people in the movies acted as if they were constipating.  There are no humors and chemistry between the main characters.  There is none of the charm that Bond movies are famous for.  Bond looks like a body builder, which takes away all the sophistication and mystery that Bond is supposed to possess.  Skip this one.
0374105235|5.0|I am not much of a big reader, but this book captured me.  Once I started it, I had to finish it.  You get a real look into the war in Sierra Leone and how this is affeting the world.<br /><br />This book was great and very well written.
B000K7UBTI|1.0|The movie is horrible, does no justice to the character.  The best animation you get is on the front cover and that's the only place you will see the Mandarin, he never shows in the movie.  The story is awful and makes no sense; it's so bad that I barely made it to the end.  No sure what Marvel was thinking when they real3eased it.  Stay away from it at all costs.

B00000IMCW|5.0|Although I must give cudos to the remade version of this film, better production values and such, the original trilogy is essential horror fare. In 1968, a space probe returns from orbiting venus, and some kind of mutated radiation has infected Earth's atmosphere. The recently deceased are affected. Any dead body not already buried or incinerated, is reanimated, something has affected the decedent's brain, and it now exists in a primal, non-social way. It's not cannibalism, per se, as a cannibal will stalk and eat their own kind. They leave one another alone, but only want to devour the living. They aren't actually hungry, but the search for and consumption of fresh food, is one of our most basic instincts.<br /><br />\\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" picks up in 1978, ten years after the original outbreak (\\"Night Of The Living Dead\\"). The living have been overrun by the walking dead, Martial Law is now in effect, and all cities are in chaos. The military and police originally thought they could bring this contageon under control, but they were apparently wrong. After the opening sequence, at a TV station, we see SWAT teams storming a housing project, and one man's vendetta against the minorities living there. Walking dead have been seen there, and the tenants must be driven out. They see it as a raid, and a blood-bath ensues. Tear gas cannisters, gunfire, screams, and devouring of humans happen here, and it is what things would really be like, if such a horrific thing could happen. The script narrows the cast down to four main characters, who now must find a place to live until things settle down, flying in a helicopter over the Pennsylvanian countryside, settling down, and setting up camp at the Monroeville Mall, near Pittsburgh. I get a kick out of watching this, because I live near the places these movies were filmed, and have been to the mall shown here, as well as the cemetary where they filmed \\"Night...\\"<br /><br />The film slows down here, but it's perfectly in line, because it's supposed to portray the isolation and boredom these people must face if they are to survive. Even though they have all the comforts of home, all the merchandise in the mall, at their disposal, they are isolated, and must try to ignore the zombies, the lower class, always looking for a way to get in, and infiltrate their little kingdom. This is Romero's social commentary, about classes of people, but if you read too much into it, you may not enjoy the film as much. It's just a sideline.<br /><br />Their way of life , after however many months, is spoiled, when a large biker gang discovers their little set-up, and they force their way in, and nothing positive ensues. The carnage is unbelievable.<br /><br />(spoiler)<br /><br />With only two of the four core cast members left, they must now leave this place, the only home they've known since leaving society to start over, very little fuel in the helicopter, no food, no water, and no direction. How many of us have experienced this in life, a total, unexpected uprooting, and how many times? The way this entire sequence is presented, it looks bleak, desolate, and cold, and is very effective. And as they fly away, into the dawn, so to speak, one wonders what they will encounter. Leaving the ending open like this, actually makes one think about it; where would you go, and even if you had the first idea, would you make it?<br /><br />This is a very well-made movie. Simple story-line, but full of twists and turns, and gut-churning special effects for fans of on-screen gore. Good films are timeless.because it's supposed to portray the isolation and boredom these people must face if they are to survive.

B000OCXFCO|5.0|Megadeth have always been the most intelligent, politically motivated band of the \\"big 4\\". United Abominations takes their politcally motivated lyrics to the 21st century. After a period of experimentation in the late '90's, Megadeth have been slowly coming back to form on their previous 2 efforts (The World Needs A Hero & The System Has Failed), but this is the first true Megadeth CD in years. Songs like Sleepwalker and Washington is Next are reminiscent of Rest In Peace.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|A fantastic journey with Charlie and Willy, which in a simple way with clear examples shows us baic lessons of life.<br /><br />A dream of colors, flavors, textures, sounds... in a word \\"magnificent\\"<br /><br />A must for every kid and adult in this planet! specially if the kids get to see it together with their parents to ask questions and enjoy.
B00005JPAO|3.0|Even though it's one of the finest movies I've seen in recent years, I've decided not to add to the bountiful array of positive comments about \\"The Queen\\" as a film.  It is everything its admirers say it is, and more- no problem there.  What IS problematic is the DVD version, specifically its sound balance.  Much of the dialogue is very soft, so naturally one compensates by turning up the volume on the TV.  That works only until Alexandre Desplat's gorgeous score begins to be played; the music booms so loudly that it is physically uncomfortable to hear.  I spent much of my viewing of \\"The Queen\\" with one wary finger on the volume button of my remote, adjusting it way up for dialogue scenes, and way down for music.  It seems to me that the sound mix is terribly off.  If this mix worked in theatres, it's not working so well on home video, and needs to be re-mixed.  In addition, the extras are more than a bit lacklustre.  There's a fine interview with Helen Mirren, a few more with the cast and crew, and a couple of nice commentary tracks, one of which is by Robert Lacey, the best-known of the Queen's unofficial biographers.  But that's pretty much it.  There's very little about the \\"making of\\", which would have been fascinating, given that the film so convincingly portrays locations that could not actually be used, like Balmoral.  Again, the film itself is extraordinary- the kind of thoughtful, heartfelt piece of film-making one sees all too seldom in this day and age.  My comments are directed only at the DVD transfer.
B000OCZD60|4.0|I'm saying \\"finally\\" because we've finally received a version of the Road Warrior that looks outstanding! The picture looks the best I've ever seen and while the sound isn't as great in terms of bass reproduction, it still sounds very clear, just a tiny bit lackluster. Several of the scenes have a bit of softness to them probably due to age but I'd say about 95% of the film looks crystal clear. There aren't many extras other than an introduction by film critic Leonard Maltin and a filmmaker commentary. A bit lacking in the extras department but the commentary is informative enough for film enthusiasts and fans of the film. It'd be nice to get a retrospective documentary one day on this classic.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the movie is delivered in an above average presentation and definitely worth a peek in HD.

0345494768|3.0|I consider myself to be a die-hard Star Wars fan, and when I heard this book was coming out I was thrilled!  A comprehensive book about the beginnings of the Star Wars saga - from concept to the first movie - was long overdue.  Once it arrived, though, I must say I was somewhat disappointed.  The book seemed to think that if some fact was available anywhere else, it needn't be included.  I expected at least some consideration given to major changes in the film made as late as the editing stage - such as the deletion of the Biggs scenes on Tatooine - but these barely pass without mention.  I also found the \\"rare photos\\" all too often to be of the crew of Star Wars and ILM rather than pictures of details or props from the movie itself.  I have the utmost respect and admiration for these people, but that's not a reason to buy a $75 book.  If you're a Star Wars fan, you can glean more from fan histories on the internet than you can from here - although it does have nice additions and some surprising facts.  The physical format and page quality is, to be fair, impressive and enjoyable.  Overall, I'd recommend this book if it can be purchased at discount, but not at full list price.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I'm not going to labor you with details of the \\"reformed LP\\" more like the \\"deformed LP\\" since others seemed have done that here. LOL. LP is still good. Maturity does result in change... Yeah, some songs sorta of the flav of the classic LP, thank God for memories. 2 1/2 stars.
B000OONTFU|1.0|It really wasn't ideal to be forced into purchasing all 3 movies at the same time.  That really bugged me.  I was able to find the set at a local best buy for $50.  I'm not sure if it rang up wrong or what.  The video and audio is amazing non the less and was totally worth it to see the first movie in high def.  Animatrix is in SD...  bs but oh well.  Drops the set 2 stars for me since that was the only highlight besides the first movie in this over priced set.  Also being forced to buy the last 2 movies was another 2 stars.  They always find a way to push these down your throat.  I'm gonna sale the other 2 on ebay and try to recoop some cash.  Oh well defiantly disappointed with this whole mess.  I hope an end draws near for this format war and movies won't be so tossed together and features will become standard.
1582701709|1.0|this has to be the ultimate in new age garbage. It seems totally geared to modern self centered, completely materialistic people that cannot take any resposibilty for their actions. Not suprising to see it be such a big hit in the states. The secret really throws out some evil themes. I guess people who buy into it deserve it. good luck filling the unfillable void in your life,
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The Planet Earth series is incredible audio visual survey of the beauty and majesty of our planet. Technical innovations were utilized to film our planet and some of it's more elusive occupants in a way that has heretofore been impossible.  The effort put forth by the BBC's Planet Earth team of producers, directors, photographers, etc. is remarkable in and of itself.  Their final product is a work of art worth archiving and revisiting from time-to-time.  This documentary has raised the bar for future such projects.  It would be nice if everyone could see this series, because I believe this will influence us to take better care of our beautiful planet and all its creatures.
B000OCXM68|3.0|There is only one extra song, LOVE.  That's it.  That's not worth paying double the price for this version.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000OCXMAE|3.0|Listened to Minutes to Midnight yesterday and was disappointed.  A few tracks were great, especially What I've Done, which sounds like the old LP.  Can't compare to previous CDs.

I believe in the law of attraction because it's worked for me in the past two years and it stills working up to now.  Canfield use a very current English.

B000063TDY|5.0|Saxon's ball rock is solid! From the great opening<br /><br />track this rocks! This album is one of Saxon's most<br /><br />consistent from this era. I had only heard the title<br /><br />track but songs like Lights in the Sky, Requiem and<br /><br />Baptism of Fire sound like the classic Saxon while<br /><br />Songs like I can't get enough, Crash Dive and my<br /><br />favorite I'm on Fire written by Nick Carter are<br /><br />also great songs while giving it a different sound.<br /><br />The production is also great giving it a melodic<br /><br />but hard rocking sound. I think this is one of the<br /><br />best all around albums Saxon has delivered and it's<br /><br />well worth getting. I can't get enough of it!
B00062J00S|5.0|The movie was in very good condition.  I was really happy with the product and the price.
0394818237|5.0|This is a great book for inquisitive little minds and all the whys in the world. My son loves this book and we read it every night. It is great for Mums and Dads too, as it helps with answers to everything related to the subject. My only grouse with it is that the drawings are a bit out of date, but that cannot be helped as the author did write it a long time ago. I would recommend it to anyone with a pre-schooler. Makes a great gift.
B00003CWOL|5.0|This won't fly with overly sensitive religious people. Excellent humor, this movie is one you will want to share with friends and watch again and again.
0385340559|3.0|Advanced mathematics play a significant role in the latest Jack Reacher novel, a coded formula that holds the clues Reacher and his term use to backtrack the death of one of their friends, a part of the elite military cabal that performed successful missions for the government, but are now returned to civilian life. Years have passed since the eight have been in contact and now one of them is dead. Loyalty and shared expertise are key to the unit and when Calvin Franz meets a violent death, one by one the remaining few answer the call, their number seemingly reduced by four by the time they go into action. Reacher is the first to respond, locating Frances Neagley in LA. Later, Karla Dixon and Dave O'Donnell arrive to learn of the probable fate of the others. Unraveling this mystery requires all their considerable skills, the experienced team once believing themselves invincible. Dodging post-9/11 security, the four ex-soldiers come face to face with some hard truths about the directions their lives have taken since the old days.<br /><br />No matter what elaborate scheme is behind the plot of a Reacher novel; Child makes sense of even the wildest tale. Reacher's appeal, and by extension that of his comrades, is their outside-the-law mentality and ability to out-maneuver and out-plan even the cleverest villain. Violence is endemic to Child's popular series, Jack Reacher strolling through circumstances that would fell a lesser man. That's his appeal: large, smart, ruthless. The formula works just as well here, if a little drier for the reliance on mathematical projections to uncover clues from LA to Las Vegas. But this novel is new, not vintage Reacher, a kinder, gentler, less frequently violent man than in the other titles (The Killing Floor, Die Trying). I don't find the Jack Reacher in Bad Luck and Trouble nearly as compelling and hope he hasn't lost his edge, returning next time to the macho style that so defines the series. Luan Gaines/2007.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|The Holiday is a feel good movie -- Light, romantic, well-acted about two women who for their own reasons decide to swap houses during the holidays only to discover that the world can be a better place than they have known and it holds delightful surprises. It is, as I said, a feel good movie.
B000N3SRRC|4.0|Solid rock cd from this band. They can do no wrong. Not a classic in their discography, but I dig it.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I love this musical!  So happy to have it on DVD!  Rich in color and clarity.
B00005JPFF|3.0|THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE GREAT AND THE ACTORS CERTAINLY DID THEIR JOB, BUT THEY SEEM TO HAVE HAD A POOR SCRIPT TO WORK WITH.  IT HAD SO MANY ANGLES THAT IN PLACES IT WAS CONFUSING BUT MOSTLY IT DRAGGED,AND WAS TOO LONG.  THE PLOT WAS DEFINATELY LACKING BUT IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE STORY, THE ACTION WAS GOOD.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|With this new CD, they have a different sound than from their earlier album.  It's a little calmer but it has a new fresh feel to the album.
B0007GAEGC|1.0|If you're looking for ambient music, buy this.  It is not Celtic music, at all.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Like almost everyone else before me has written, I was disappointed upon first listen to the new LP cd. It is nothing like the other two albums that Linkin Park has released and at first I thought that was a bad thing too. But you know what... it is not a bad thing. Upon really giving this cd a listen and not judging it based on previous albums I can safely say it is a better album than their last cd. This cd is better because its not the same approach every track like their previous two cds. LP has gone beyond the rap-rock of the past and attacked new types of songs. This cd goes from the hard rock Metallica style song of \\"Given Up\\" to the beautiful closing ballad of \\"The Little Things Give You Away.\\" Every track is a different direction from almost straight rap, to hard rock to soft emotional ballads. Nothing is the same and that is a good thing. LP could have gave us an album like their previous two and made everyone happy, but as artists they refused to be predictable and in the end we are all better served for this risk. The album is not perfect by any means (I could have done without \\"In Between\\" or \\"Valentine's Day\\"), but it deserves to be seen as a bold and creative step foreward for LP. There are some great tracks on this cd that will grow on anyone that gives it a real chance. Best songs include: \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\", \\"Shadow of the Day\\", \\"What Ive Done\\", \\"Hands Held High\\", and \\"In Pieces.\\"
B00005JPAO|5.0|I had wanted to see the \\"Queen\\" when it came out in the theatre, but was not able to do so.  When I found it on Amazon, I ordered it immediately.  I have always been interested in reading or seeing anything about the British royal family.  There were a few surprises in the movie, mainly the attitude of Prince Phillip about Diana and the way Prince Charles reacted to statements made by his mother.  All the stars were great, especially Helen Mirren.  She looked so much like the real Queen, it was spooky. <br /> <br />
B00004S35Z|5.0|The only thing new that I could possibly add to any forum regarding this phenomenal piece of musical artistry is that whenever I put it on, I experience something that goes way beyond listening pleasure. Listening to this CD, from beginning to end, is for me, almost like a spiritual experience. I find it spiritually healing. It's restful and uplifting all at the same time. Each song picks me up in a soothing emotional embrace and carries me like a newborn baby on to the next one, right till the end of the CD, when I wake up from my trance and wonder where all the time went.<br /><br />Stevie Wonder doesn't have many peers but I will forever be in awe of him and his small group of fellow legends whose music is still relevant, still vibrant, still totally engaging, well over 30 years after it was first made.<br /><br />Absolutely beautiful. Five stars are nowhere near enough.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This was astounding on even our 'little' 32\\" HD-LCD.  The filming was light years ahead of anything you've ever seen and Mr. Attenborough was answered most of the questions in my head.  I can't wait to watch it again. <br />Be warned - Disk 5 is mostly a reality check that discusses our impact to the planet and the creatures we share it with.  A bit depressing to see how much we know but don't have the political will to do anything about.  I found it very interesting to hear about the situation from the prospective of the photographers and producers who are out there making a living filming without intruding.  I also found a bit of the absurd -- at least to me -- a zoologist working on Jurassic Planet.  She thinks we should collect DNA from all the species so we can populate a new planet some day.  Sounds great - the whole universe at our disposal.  We can suck the planet dry and go find a new one.  When we trash that one, we can take the DNA out of the freezer and find another planet.  Sadly, I suspect our tax dollars are funding her research grant.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|If you were wondering how their new music would sound, what genre they were going to get placed into now that they decided to go another way, then the best I can come up with is that they have joined the emo mainstream. Listening to their new music wants me to slit my wrists, its so panzyish that all i visualise during the songs is a blooming field of pink tulips with all band members groping eachother. Very soft songs, very sappy lyrics, a mix between new kids on the block and jimmy eat world.
B000NDIAWY|4.0|Brandi explores new sounds and rhythms in this, her second album. She seems to own her voice a bit more and sound more confident with each song. Like most albums, there are one or two songs that are not quite as good as the others. But the good songs, like I Was Made For You, make up for it.
0062502182|2.0|i dove into this book with high expectations (perhaps this was my mistake), and after giving the book a chance for several chapters, all i could think was: maybe if i spoke portuguese this would be a better book. <br /> <br />i tired very quickly from the repeated \\"theme\\" and message of the book, which dragged on page after page. had it not been such an easy to read writing style i would have given up on it before finishing.  <br /> <br />in hind-site, it's easy to extract the main and key plot points/moments, and they do stick-out as being fun--however, these points could have very easily been wrapped up in a third of the space, or perhaps ever approached in an illustrated children's book and been much more appealing. <br /> <br />i would never tell anyone this book was not worth reading, but to me, it's certainly not worth the hype--the english translation anyway. <br />
B000MRAAJW|5.0|It is impossible to put into words how awesome this series is. The pictures are simply breathtaking, and you really get a whole new respect for nature. The very best HD DVD I have ever seen. I never saw the series on the BBC or the US version on discovery. I am so glad that I found this DVD and bought it. I would have missed out on an astonishing series that delivers every minute of the many hours of film. Planet Earth is a must have!
B00005JPAO|5.0|Great DVD.  The commentary by the royal biography is excellent. I highly recommend the commentary. It is both informative and entertaining.
0743454537|5.0|I am usually a slow reader, I pick a book up and read a small part here and there.  This book was different, it captured my attention and I didn't want to put it down.  Jodi Picoult is one of my new favorite authors and I am going to start reading her other books. <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|We used to watch the show and then when it was cancelled we were bummed!  Then this came out and it is one of the coolest sci-fi movies!  The characters are great, there is plenty of emotion and it is just an all around good movie.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This is easily a great album. When I first heard \\"What I've Done\\" I knew it would be. I went and bought the Special Edition the day it came out. Listened to it over and over. Yes, this album is fundamentally different, but if you nay-sayers were listening in the first place you would know they told everyone outright they were changing their sound. And if you watch the DVD included w/the Special Edition you will see why. They were trying to redefine themselves, their sound, what and who they were. They are still Linkin Park, they still make awesome music and this will fit nicely into your playlist alongside Hybrid Theory, Reanimation and Meteora.
B00005JPAO|4.0|I feel this movie was such a kick, an insight to the Royal Family that we will never see, and Helen M. certainly deserved an Oscar for this one!!<br /><br />  I really enjoyed the whole thing, and it kept me interested without getting too \\"stuffy\\" for us Americans!!<br /><br />  Good history lesson and one to show your kids someday.
6305744793|5.0|What a splendid film!  The acting and actors are all wonderful, the script is an absolute hoot, the filming is brilliant, and the one-liners come faster than you can say 'Groucho Marx.'  Highly recommended!!
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Boston's self-titled debut album brings out all the best cliches in the formidable armory of music journalists.  Expect to read lots of references to the 1970s; not limited to but no doubt including riffs on bad hair styles, screaming guitar solos of a type that long since died out in popular music, Watergate, and Arab oil embargos. <br /> <br />Being of a completely different generation to my mulleted predecesors, I regrettably can't share these golden memories.  I can however enjoy this album.  I first heard it from start to finish aboard a transatlantic flight to America, and remember being so bowled over by the up-beat balls-out rock of it all that the stewardess had to tell me to shush, if only because my humming was waking up the deaf AARP spokesman sat next to me.   <br /> <br />I can't really find fault with this album; in my view More than a Feeling, Peace of Mind, and Rock N Roll Band are the fine tunes, mainly because they start the album with an excitable flourish.  Check it out.  You won't be disappointed.
B000957O82|5.0|This is the kind of movie you could cuddle up and watch with a 1st, 2nd or 3rd date (especially a 3rd). Will Smith has made a great comical come-back!
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Years from now, Shortbus will go down as the film that had the guts to do what no ever film ever did before.  At first glance, one might equate this movie with [...].  The sex scenes are the real thing, not simulated.  While graphic and unapologetic, they serve not to arouse but to reveal the high emotionality depicted within the characters this film.  What makes Shortbus one of the best films of 2006 is the way it depicts the intensity of emotions associated with sexual crisis.<br /><br />Director John Cameron Mitchell worked with the actors to create the multi-dimensional and complex characters portrayed.  Among them are Sophia, a sex therapist who has never experienced an orgasm; [...] couple James and Jamie whose introduction of additional partners into their sex life is masking a deep internal conflict, and dominatrix Severin who struggles to have a meaningful connection with somebody.  It is hard to not feel the pain of these characters as we see it on screen.  Each struggles to resolve their crisis with the help of an underground salon called \\"Shortbus\\" where polysexual expression fills the rooms.<br /><br />The film makes excellent symbolic use of electrical blackouts.  As somebody who lived in New York City during the famous 2003 all-city blackout, it was interesting to learn that that event was a source of inspiration for Mitchell and the other creative individuals involved in this movie.  Don't expect this movie to be one that you watch once, feel you have all the answers, and never see again.  This one begs repeat viewing!
B000O178BY|4.0|I haven't bought an NIN CD in a long time.  With all the hype surrounding \\"Year Zero,\\" I thought I'd give them another try.  Didn't get much out of it.  I'll stick to the Perfect Drug CD next time I'm in the mood for NIN.
1582701709|3.0|What is so secret about this? I started reading about the law of attraction two years ago, would go to the reccommended reading in the back and then go buy those books. THis information has been out for way over 100 years. the best ones to me are Abraham HIcks, Sanaya Roman, and Jane Roberts. Of course all those are \\"channeled\\" books, but who cares, the information is even better than in the Secret. All the secret is is a repeat of old news.  <br />What I liked about it is that it does sum up many books in one and is a great introduction to the law of attraction. <br />To those who likened it to the occult, well yes it is similiar to magick almost. Just one way to take charge of your own life and  accept responsibility for your own life.  Whats wrong with that?   <br />DC
B00005JPD0|4.0|Denzel plays an ATF officer assigned to a special squad looking for a terrorist bomber. The squad uses some new technology, which allows the investigation to move through different video and audio perspectives and through time. Gradually, Denzel's character becomes convinced he can communicate through time, and if so, he may be able to stop-before-the-act a terrorist who's blown up a crowded New Orleans ferry. Motivating Denzel's character, in part, is his desire to save the beautiful woman the terrorist used as a torch to in essence light the bomb. Gradually, Denzel's character becomes convinced that maybe he too can cross the time barrier and take matters into his own hands.<br /><br />This was an extremely good movie, with science fiction that made sense, good action scenes and attractive characters. The only flaw IMHO was that there was an easier path to the outcome which would have enhanced the credibility and satisfaction level of the end.
0790729970|4.0|Watching this movie with the director's comments you learn that the operating budget for the film was 18 million dollars. Also the studio almost cut the 'Cuban Pete' scene until early screenings revealed it to be the most popular scene in the movie. Jim Carrey is actually singing  however Cameron Diaz, who performs earlier is not. Charlie Russel does not say Cameron Diaz isn't singing but his silence during her performance spoke volumes to me. 18 million is an incredible figure because that amount of money would currently be required to get Carrey or Diaz in any movie that wasn't pure voice over work. The Mask is entirely Charles Russel's vision minus 2 deleted scenes. The scene where Peggy is brutally slain was rightfully deleted. The scene where Leif Erickson discovers America by accident as a byproduct of the cursed masks' disposal could have stayed in but would have begged a revisitation of sorts so was cut for brevity and cohesion. Carrey is sympathetic as Ipcus and hilarious as the Mask. The talented supporting cast misses no notes. Cameron Diaz has never been more alluring on camera. Many successful movies have employed surreal period themes. The Mask uses a circa 1940's theme to good effect. This movie was under rated in it's day but has stood the test of time and still represents Carrey's most cohesive and compelling comedy performance. The movie is also a lesson to studios that over meddle in decisions that are creative. As a result 'The Mask' is a much better movie than 'Bruce Almighty' even tho the budgets for the two films were 40 million dollars apart.
0143036424|5.0|Walt Longmire, a Wyoming county sheriff in Bighorn Mountain country, is faced with a complex murder case, where the convicted rapists of a challenged Cheyenne girl are being murdered one by one. Top of the suspect list is Walt's best friend, Henry Standing Bear, who happens to own one of the rare buffalo guns of the type  used in the murders. Walt doesn't have much help in the investigation: Only the retired sheriff, a one-legged crusty legend now in a nursing home; a sullen, dark deputy with a penchant for beating up drunks; and a foul-mouthed femme-fatale deputy who has a crush on him. Can Walt count on his best friend Henry Standing Bear, or is Henry the killer. The outcome of the rape trial didn't set well in the Cheyenne community. Some Cheyenne don't believe Walt did all he could.<br /><br />I don't know where I picked up this book, but I'm sure glad I did. Craig Johnson is one of the most talented and refreshing new talents I've come across in years. I was so impressed with this book, I've recommended it to all my reading friends and I ordered Johnson's other two books. Craig Johnson has the potential to become the next James Lee Burke, and for that I am extremely grateful. Writers such as Burke and Johnson don't come along often.
B000LE0TGA|5.0|This double album came out when I was preparing to start spring semester at a new college. The memories come surging back and the quality enhances this great sounding music.  Jeff Lynne was a tune-smith supreme!!  The musical peaks, crisp surges and those perfect hooks stirred  memories with each song.   Back in the day, these songs were played everywhere I went.  ELO was the main sound of my world!!   ELO was a major musical force in the 70's.  Their sound is unmatched and timeless.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Beautifully done and awe inspiring. Each song grows on you. Just shows how LP has matured from their initial heydays of Hybrid Theory. Love this album
B000OCXMAE|2.0|As other reviewers have mentioned, this CD was not the typical Linkin Park style.  When I read an interview that stated more effort went into this album than any other before, I wondered where all of that energy went.  Over 100 demo songs were produced before coming up with the final tract list.  Much of the CD is filled with anti-Bush and anti-war rhetoric.  While I have no problem with adding political discourse to music, many of the songs come across as a repeat of what Green Day accomplished several years ago.
B000MTDRKE|1.0|To fully understand this concept album one must do a little research. Though the research material may surprise you. This album springs forth from a little known group called the gospel assembly and the leader was not Martin Luther. The reformer in this group is William Sowders and it is well worth your time to research what lies behind the curtain. Is it really Sola Scriptura, you'll have to take the time to find out
1582701709|5.0|A very enlightening read.  Well written and loaded with plenty of examples.  I have given this book as a gift and I am currently encouraging my 12 and 13 year old kids to read it.  It is easy and fun to apply it's principles in everyday life and then sit back and watch what happens!
B000A59PMO|5.0|Here's a clue about how smart and cool this show is.  At the end of season 2, the fans of this show didn't know whether it would be picked up by the new CW network.  But the writers gave us a clever hint when one of the characters named \\"Clarence Wiedman\\" calls another character who picks up the phone and says \\"CW?\\" to which Clarence responds \\"it's a go\\". <br /> <br />The narrator is Veronica, a teenager who has had a tough year during which her best friend was murdered, her boyfriend dumped her, her dad lost his job and her mom left town.  Veronica's story has arcs that last the whole season - the mystery of who killed her friend, why her boyfriend and her mom left her, etc.. - and mysteries that she solves in each episode. <br /> <br />The stories involve characters of different races and, most importantly on this show, economic backgrounds.  The show isn't color-blind, but it's money, not color, that matters in the relationships between characters.  All of the characters have flaws and redeeming qualities.  Veronica's warm relationship with her dad is one of tv's best.   It's what makes it believable that Veronica has survived all of the turmoil of the last year with her sense of humor intact. <br /> <br />One thing to keep in mind while you're watching:  Some of the secondary characters that seem like they might be just \\"story of the week\\" characters do come back later in the season, so pay attention (especially to Logan and to Meg). <br /> <br />The episodes must be watched in order.  Season 1 is the best of the three seasons, but beware that, at the end of Season 1, you are going to want to have the start of Season 2 ready to go!
B000N3ST8O|5.0|This set is incredible, the 5.1 is great! DVD rocks as does the CD, I have almost every Stevie album and all the greatist hits cd's and this set is incredible in comparison. THe pics in this set are awesome as is Stevie....
0143038419|5.0|In my 59 years I have never read a book the caused me to laugh out loud and cry out loud. Besides being very entertaining and having technically superior writing skills, there is much wisdom imparted in and between the lines.  This wisdom is of particular help for those 53% of us who have gone through a divorce and to the additional 40% of us that are not happy in their marrages. For those who are reletively happy, the book gives insite into increasing happiness and joy in life.  A book good for everyone.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I LOVE Stevie and Fleetwood, but out of all the compilations to date, this one is by far the greatest from Stevie. The mix on 'Love Is' with Sarah McLachlan is outstanding, as is 'Bombay Sapphire' and all the rest, a well rounded album worth a full listening!
B000FP2OPY|4.0|Supernatural is a very good show, and the dvd of the show are perfect. I'm Spanish, and here we don't have this show on dvd, I bought this show some days ago here, in Amazon. The dvd's have a very good presentation, with the digipack, here we don't have this things, here only slim case or a new plastic boxes.
B00005JPCF|4.0|The story of this movie is simple; an Emperor penguin, Mumble, is born in Antarctica.  He cannot sing but he can dance.  This inability to sing and his flaunting of his dancing gets him outcast from his land.  Mumble falls in with a different group of penguins, who just happened to talk like Speedy Gonazeles, and who appreciate his dancing.  Mumble and five friends venture of to find aliens (human beings) and Mumble eventually ends up in a zoo in the US.  He returns to Antarctica with humans who discover how their commercial fishing is hurting the penguins, and hence stop.      The movie features many big Hollywood names such as Elijah Wood as Mumble, Nicole Kidman as his mom, Brittany Murphy as Mumble's girlfriend, Hugo Weaving as the elder penguin, and Robin Williams.  The latter voices two roles, one Mexican and one messianic, and it is his performance that provides much of the comedy in this movie.  In a sense, this movie can be seen as Robin Williams' return to his normal roles.  Throughout the 80's and most of the 90's, Mr. Williams made his name in  zany comedies such as Popeye, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Aladdin, and Patch Adams.  Thrown in the mix were funny dramas such as Good Morning Vietnam and the Dead Poet's Society.  Then in the late 1990's and early part of the 21st century, he hit rock bottom with fans and critiques alike with pure non-comedies like Insomnia, One Hour Photo, Jakob the Liar, Bicentennial Man and The Final Cut.  But in the end of 2006, he returned back to form with two comedies; Night at the Museum and Happy Feet.  Both movies feature Robin Williams in his traditional wacky, zany, combination of idiotic faces, sarcasm, slapstick action and bombastic dialogue.  Though Night at the Museum did better, this movie truly features Robin Williams at his best; two roles, sometimes involved in the same dialogue.      Along with the comedy of Robin Williams, this movie features a lot of music from hip-hop, rock and roll, R&B, and even some country.And the special effects are top notch.  all in all, a geat movie.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|United Abominations, Megadeth's 11th album, is by far the best since the Rust in Piece days. Incorporating the pure metal of Rust in Piece with the technique of 15 years more experience, United Abominations is Megadeth at its purest. Opening with \\"Sleepwalker\\", a thrash masterpiece that screams \\"return to form\\", and ending with the fast and heavy \\"Burnt Ice\\", filled with  amazing solos reminiscent of Hangar 18, this album will be remembered as one of Megadeth's greatest. The only criticism that most find, and that I agree with, is that the duet of A Tout Le Monde is misplaced on the album, and detracts from the flow of tracks. Aside from that United Abominations is an extremely solid album, marking a return to form for Megadeth, and should be picked up by any metal fan looking for a great album.
B000026HWR|5.0|Thanks to the wonderful institution of Amazon's \\"Listmania\\" and my relentless search thereof for great 'lost' 60's and 70's rock, folk, country and soul music, I was recently helped into discovering this unique genre-bender of a classic album from Terry Callier.  After researching him a bit, I found that this is one of his three most highly-recommended 70's albums, sandwiched in between 1972's [[ASIN:B0000250LZ Occasional Rain]] and 1975's [[ASIN:B000PDZOSA I Just Can't Help Myself]].  Since What Color Is Love was the first I heard about, and has such a classic, evocative cover (yeah, occasionally you CAN judge an album by its cover art), I decided to pick it up first.  What a great purchase--I can confidently recommend this album to fans of jazzier folk, more \\"out-there\\" folk that is influenced by more wide ranging musical styles than just American roots and blues, as well as more adventurous fans of R&B legends like Marvin Gaye and Al Green who don't mind if their soul is cut with a bit of folk and jazz.<br /><br />The album opens with the spacey \\"Dancing Girl,\\" in which Callier displays his novel combination of acoustic folk guitar with his soulful, yearning voice that seems to evoke all the best characteristics of 60's/70's black soul, but at the same time transcend the structural trappings of the genre.  On first listen, I was immediately impressed with Callier's lyrics--meaningful, mysterious, and thought provoking, on \\"Dancing Girl,\\" he lays out some mind-blowers (\\"You'll surely come to harm/With that needle all up in your arm\\") and some lines that, combined with the power of the music, transcend the words alone (\\"Anyway you want to do/Boogie, bop, or boogaloo\\" is priceless in Callier's husky whisper).  The song's structure is pretty progressive, with multiple movements and clocking in at over 9 glorious minutes.<br /><br />\\"What Color is Love\\" and \\"Just As Long As We're In Love\\" showcase Callier's strengths as an interpretive singer and his gentle side, backed by female background singers, horns and strings in a delightful blend.  \\"You Goin' To Miss Your Candyman\\" is one of the album's greatest tracks, with the funkiest soul bassline since Marvin Gaye's \\"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler),\\" and showcasing Callier's uniformly tight, gnarly rhythm section, which often includes some sick bass lines and bongo drums.  \\"Ho Tsing Mee\\" is a contemplative protest song, deceptively gentle at the beginning, building to a barnstorming climax with Callier's plaintive scat/howl elevating the song to great heights.  \\"I'd Rather Be With You\\" is the album's closest thing to a typical \\"on the road\\" folksong, and the closer is a groovy Bacharach-like blend of horns and background singers repeating \\"You Don't Care\\" for a tranquil, meditative end to a real trip of an album.<br /><br />Terry Callier is one of the greatest relatively unknown artists I've discovered lately, and I can't help but recommend him as highly as I can.  I'm looking forward to checking out his other classics, and maybe some of his newer music, which I heard is also excellent.  Take a chance--I think you'll find Callier rewarding.ackground singers, horns and strings in a delightful blend.  \\"You Goin' To Miss Your Candyman\\" is one of the album's greatest tracks, with the funkiest soul bassline since Marvin Gaye's \\"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler),\\" and showcasing Callier's uniformly tight, gnarly rhythm section, which often includes some sick bass lines and bongo drums.  \\"Ho Tsing Mee\\" is a contemplative protest song, deceptively gentle at the beginning, building to a barnstorming climax with Callier's plaintive scat/howl elevating the song to great heights.  \\"I'd Rather Be With You\\" is the album's closest thing to a typical \\"on the road\\" folksong, and the closer is a groovy Bacharach-like blend of horns and background singers repeating \\"You Don't Care\\" for a tranquil, meditative end to a real trip of an album.

B000OCXFCO|5.0|I was quite impressed with this new release from Megadeth. Keeping up ith the political problems, this album will stand the test of time. I really enjoyed the new sound of Megadth's new lineup. <br /> <br />I was a bit surprised with the new version of \\"A Tout Le Monde,\\" ( a song that I want played at my funeral) <br /> <br />I agree with another reviewer where he said that this is the best Megadeth release since the Countdown/Youthanasia era.  <br />
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Not as strong as their Absolution album, but solid Muse. There is a little more complexity to their style nowadays compared to their earliest albums, which is one of the elements I most appreciate in music. It's a little lighter than I'd like on piano, but what is there works well. Standout tracks for me are \\"Take a Bow\\" and \\"City of Delusion.\\" ROCK!<br /><br />Muse is one of those bands that I simply can never get enough of.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|On May 4, 2007, \\"Minutes to Midnight\\", Linkin Park's fifth official album was leaked. Minutes To Midnight, revolving around the concept of the notorious doomsday clock, molds a new image to be branded onto the name 'Linkin Park'. Before this release, Linkin Park was known for their catchy drop d guitar chords, undeniably muscular choruses, and articulate raps dealing with the trials and tribulations of everyday life. Linkin Park's very first demo was released in 1997, before the band was even known as Linkin Park. Ten years have passed, and a new formula has been invented and finely executed. <br /> <br />Minutes To Midnight is the definition of what one may call an audible odyssey, taking the listener on a roller coaster of a ride, but somehow managing to stay on track and not lose focus of what the concept of the album is all about. Ten years has passed and through these years, Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda's lyrical landscape has expanded to concepts listeners have never been exposed to. Several songs (No More Sorrow, The Little Things Give You Away, Hands Held High, and the first single 'What I've Done') encompass a political message. Unlike many rock bands today, Linkin Park decides to leave out their own agenda, and leaves one with a myriad of issues to think about and to make their own judgments. <br /> <br />Most noticeably different on this record is the fine addition of ballads and power ballads, a musical corridor Linkin Park has been hesitant to explore in the past. Luckily, Linkin Park does it quite well. Chester Bennington's transitional legacy as one of metal's most admired screamers and one of rock's finest singers is not omitted on this album. Rob Bourdon, already exposed as an extraordinary drummer, took his skills to the next level on this album. Also, with the assistance of Rick Ruben as producer, Dave Farrell aka Phoenix's bass lines are skillfully complex, loud, and clear, adding yet another new dimension to their tunes. The drop d guitarchords have all been put to rest, as beautiful guitar notes make their way onto virtually every track off of this album. And yes, they have in fact implemented guitar solos that transition beautifully into every song. <br /> <br />This will be Linkin Park's first album that has a Parental Advisory slapped on it. Although unnecessary, the Parental Advisory sticker is no indicator whatsoever of a curse-filled album. The F bomb gets dropped a few times on one track and a few other curses made their way onto two other tracks, but other than that, every track is clean as a whistle. Rumor had it that Mike Shinoda would no longer be providing a hip-hop insight on this album. While this is partially true, he sings, yes sings, on one track (\\"In Between\\") all by himself, he has a rap track all to himself delving into political issues using vocabulary and issues that many listeners will be left opening history books to. There is one song that instills the old Linkin Park formula (\\"Bleed It Out\\"), just as a reminder that they have not eradicated their roots. <br /> <br />All-in-all, this record will by far be Linkin Park's biggest adult audience-targeted album. The band has noticeably matured through their instrumentation, lyrical masterpieces, and thought-provoking sounds and images. A few months ago, asked about what he could say about the new sound on the new album, Linkin Park co-frontman Chester Bennington boldly stated, \\"The way we've been classified, and how people think they know us, that's all going to die.\\" No lies were told when that statement was made. Without a doubt, when Minutes To Midnight is released on May 15, 2007, they will once again conquer the rock arena, raking in a new slew of fans, the more mature thinkers of today. <br /> <br />Linkin Park - Minutes To Midnight - 5 out of 5 stars.

B000OCZ0ZO|5.0|I used to be The Anti-Linkin Park -- until the \\"Live in Texas\\" DVD on a really good surround system.   <br /> <br />A stagnate band is a dying band.  What if the Beatles had never done Rubber Soul and Revolver?  Would teeny-bopper rock have carried them even as far as 1969?  What if the Beach Boys had never done Pet Sounds?  Another 40 years of awful surfer pop? <br />  <br />Rock history has a habit of rewarding bands for 180 degree changes. <br /> <br />This album is fantastic. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that I really, really would have liked a 5.1 mix, but PCM is good enough for now. <br /> <br />Thanks, guys.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I don't know who made this cd and is calling them self Linkin Park, but it isn't the real LP. I have listened to them since Hybrid Theory and loved every song from both that cd and Meteora. This has only a select few songs that are only even ok. I hope when they come out with another cd it is like their old stuff. Otherwise music will go down the crapper. LP is my only hope...
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Just listened to \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" and the album was well worth the wait!  All great songs, no filler.  Music was varied, showing their range, arrangements were TIGHT really showing how they've matured.  But by far, the lyrics are outstanding and amazing!  This release ranks right up there with their first album, in my opinion.  They have earned the right to be proud of their work!
B00001OH7T|5.0|I honestly can't believe that some self-professed Bowie fans are giving this CD fewer than four stars.  Even if you're not a fan of soul music, just the \\"firsts\\" and the personnel on this album make it an essential record for all music fans, let alone Bowiephiles. <br /> <br />Bowie's 1975 reinvention as a blue-and-green-eyed soul singer was brilliant on a number of scores--  he went to Philadelphia to take advantage of the Sound of Philadelphia session musicians.  There, he enlisted Luther Vandross, still in his late teens, to sing, arrange the background vocals, and co-write \\"Fascination.\\"  Vandross had studied music in New York with Bowie guitar player Carlos Alomar.  The sax, featured prominently on \\"Young Americans\\" and \\"Somebody Up There Likes Me\\" was the debut of a young David Sanborn, and also his first recording.  Add John Lennon playing, singing, and writing \\"Fame\\" and you've got a classic record before you've pressed the \\"play\\" button. <br /> <br />As for the songs themselves, \\"Young Americans\\" and \\"Fame\\" are flat-out classic hits.  \\"Right\\" and \\"Win\\" are moody soul tunes, \\"Can You Hear Me,\\" \\"Fascination,\\" and \\"Somebody Up There\\" are more inspirational and traditional soul songs, very much influenced by the Philly recording environment. <br /> <br />Yeah, I could also do without the ill-advised remake of \\"Across the Universe,\\" but I assume it was Lennon's presence that demanded its inclusion.  Even 5-star albums can have a bumpy track.

In the end she brings a certain level of complexity to this novel (and others I've read) by raising moral issues that aren't easily resolved. <br />And yet there's a paint-by-the numbers quality to her writing.  She's very *good* at that, but a novel addressing such a controversial incident should stay with the reader for awhile after he or she has completed it. In spite of a well-crafted story that had me engrossed while reading, I found both characters and story slipping away from me almost immediately.
B00006GFAB|4.0|We need another review of this CD like we need another KISS compilation, i.e. a hole in the head. However, I'll put my two cents worth in (and I'm probably being generous in my monetary evaluation...)  I'm not a \\"KISS Army\\" sized KISS fan but I think they have a lot of great songs in their catalog and to compile the best onto a single CD is a task that is certain to miss the mark by most fans' standards. I can see where most of these KISS comps serve a purpose though. DOUBLE PLATINUM is the original KISS \\"best of\\" and will never be duplicated or bettered simply because it contains the best loved songs from the band's original incarnation. It's pre-disco, pre-Elder, pre-band member changes, pre-taking off the make-up, pre-Michael Bolton power ballads.  SMASHES, THRASHES & HITS is in another (lower) class all by itself. It attempted to cover the band's entire career by including DOUBLE PLATINUM-era classics, more recent material, some remixes, a re-recording, and some new material. It crashed and burned in all of these areas leaving everyone who was showing any interest completely unsatisfied. The experience of listening to SMASHES, THRASHES & HITS was akin to a groupie making her way to Gene Simmons' dressing room for some serious oral action, only to find Christopher Cross waiting for her inside.  YOU WANTED THE BEST, YOU GOT THE BEST was a collection of their best live recordings.  GOLD and the MILLENIUM COLLECTION are just further entries into the record company's ongoing marketing campaign to put visually identical \\"best of's\\" in the stores of virtually every artist that ever produced a hit record of any consequence.  So THE VERY BEST OF KISS is the first level headed attempt at a single disc career spanning compilation of KISS' most popular material (including studio and live cuts) and not containing any weird edits, remixes or rerecordings.   Okay, so we've got 21 cuts of hot KISS action.  Does it hit all the high marks? Everyone can probably agree that it doesn't. Seriously, how could it?  What's on here that doesn't belong? What's not on here that is indespensable? Everyone will have their own answers to those last two questions, but I think the compilers did a fairly decent job of cramming one disc chock full of KISS classics.  What's not on here that I would like to see? \\"ROCKET RIDE\\"!!!, \\"Do You Love Me\\", \\"Shandi\\", \\"Sure Know Something\\", \\"A World Without Heroes\\", \\"I\\", \\"Heaven's On Fire\\", \\"Tears Are Falling\\", \\"Unholy\\", Ace's \\"Rip It Out\\" and Gene's \\"Radioactive\\". But my list has two songs from THE ELDER so I probably deserve to have the KISS Army give me a serious beating.   As far as the greed argument goes, any record company is going to throw out compilations like this (particularly around Christmas time) to capitalize once again on a hit artists' ongoing popularity. It's usually the record company's greed that's evident, not the recording artists'.   So what exactly is the purpose that is being served by THE VERY BEST OF KISS? It replaces SMASHES, THRASHES & HITS which contained an inferior rerecording of \\"Beth\\", some awful remixes (whose lame idea was it to tone down the drums on \\"I Love It Loud\\"??!!) and new material that should have gone unreleased at the time. (The reviewers here that are bemoaning this compilation's lack of any new material might want to be reminded of \\"Let's Put The X In Sex\\", one of the worst songs ever recorded by anyone.) The original hits that weren't remixed for that collection are hampered by inferior remastering (probably not from the original tapes) resulting in poor sound quality.  At any rate, I think there's room for one more KISS collection and this is a pretty darn good one.  Oh, wait. I forgot about GREATEST KISS. So we really didn't need this collection after all, huh?   Oh well, never mind.
B00006G8K0|5.0|This film represented the very best of the British based Hammer Studio's many horror productions and led to the coining of the term \\"Hammer Horrors\\" which generations of moviegoers came to know as providing unique gothic and stylish renditions of classic horror in deep and vigorous colors.  It reintroduced the character of Count Dracula to the baby boomers and subsequent generations.  As opposed to Bela Lugosi's stagy, static, and fangless Dracula, we now see the Count as a dynamic and muscular force with a remarkable display of canine fangs as never before seen on the screen (with the sole exception of the classic German silent movie titled Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror, which showed Orlok/Dracula with rat-like teeth).      Christopher Lee was a forceful presence as the vampire noble man.  Peter Cushing was truly great in his performance as the Count's nemesis, Dr. Van Helsing.  This represented the second pairing of Cushing and Lee, the first being in Hammer's Curse of Frankenstein.  The teaming of these two actors was a truly fortuitous one for Hammer, the actors, and for the fans of classic horror genre films.  No other pairing was comparable with the possible exception of Lugosi and Boris Karloff.    The opening scene showing the spilling of blood on Dracula's tomb nameplate was a true shocker at the time it was first seen in the movie theater.  The subsequent scene with Dracula angrily rushing through a door with furious red veined eyes and blood dripping from his open fanged mouth, after the vampire woman bit Jonathan Harker, was absolutely frightening.  Finally, we have that breathtaking ending with Van Helsing leaping on the table and ripping down the curtains to let in sunlight to turn Dracula into dust.  Those scenes, tied into the story, presents a cinematic experience which remains with us to this day.      Horror of Dracula certainly set the tenor for all subsequent vampire films by having their glorious and gory cinematic moments shown in beautifully rendered Technicolor, thanks to the mastery of technician Jack Asher, rather than in traditional black and white.  The story, developed by scriptwriter Jimmy Sangster, was presented in a tightly woven manner which helped to assure that the dialogue and scenes would move along smoothly.  This film was as much a masterpiece of Director Terence Fisher as it was for Cushing and Lee.  Director Fisher clearly had the skills to make all the elements in the film click together to create a thrilling spectacle which continues to amaze us.  However, we must acknowledge that without the compelling acting skills provided by Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, we would never see the Horror of Dracula which we are so fortunate to have with us now.  Both Cushing and Lee have complemented each other to a very high degree.  It might be said that they represented their separate roles as the yin and yang of a paired being.  In other words, we could easily look at the roles of Van Helsing and Dracula as being two sides of the same coin.  One side representing a being of great power and evil and the other side showing a person of high intelligence, true integrity and fearlessness fighting on the side of the good.  For this reason, it was natural to find Van Helsing and Dracula going against each other as they did.  It is very difficult to imagine any other actors taking on the roles of those two protagonists as did Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.    It is my hope that Warner Brothers will do a special edition of this film and give it the extras needed, including commentaries from horror film historians, background information about Hammer and its making of Horror of Dracula, plus interviews with those involved with the making of the film including Christopher Lee.  In the meantime, one cannot do wrong with obtaining this DVD at such a reasonable price and view the finest film ever about Count Dracula and his reign of terror.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|This cd stinks! It is good for nothing more than a coaster or a frisbee! Rick, what happened? I love their first 2 cd's, but all of their talent has vanished. Too Bad!
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|DVD arrived very quickly and was well packaged.  No complaints of any kind.  Thank you.
B00005JNTX|3.0|Robert Rodriguez is very clear in the helpful \\"making of\\" featurette that accompanies this DVD that he didn't want to bring his own vision of Frank Miller's famous 1990s graphic novels to the screen, but rather reproduce Miller's  vision as exactly as possible. Rodriguez formulates his cinematographic vision so carefully to the stunning black-and-white designs of Miller's stories that the live-action shots at times suggest exceptional animation, particularly in the film's early visual highpoints, a series of physical hand-to-hand battles between the hulking avenger Marv (Mickey Rourke) and the preppy ninja/serial killer Kevin (Elijah Wood) in a rainy midnight farmscape. Miller even advised the actors on their parts and took such a hand in the filming that Rodriguez wanted to give Miller sole directing credit when the Directors' Guild of America refused to list their names together; when Miller refused to take sole credit, Rodriguez resigned from the Directors' Guild so both their names could appear together.    Like Zack Snyder's recent popular film version of Miller's THE 300, this is about as faithful a translation of Miller's graphic-novel vision to the screen as could be imagined. Miller's own layouts and storytelling is so cinematic that it translates gorgeously onto the screen. And, as with THE 300, the violence is so over-the-top and cartoonish its almost impossible to be offended by it. The great gushing fluids that come out of the characters here is not only ridiculously copious but at likely to be white or black (or, with one character, yellow) as it is red. More than anything else, this is an extended and gorgeous exercise in style. It takes what was once held as an offshoot of realism -- the Mickey Spillane-style noir detective fiction -- and spins out all its most baroque excesses to show its theatricality and artifice. All the adult women are gorgeous prostitutes or strippers; all the villains want to prey on little girls or innocents (sometimes literally); the heroes' eventual Jacobean punishments for their foes are as imaginatively and grimly excessive as possible. As gorgeous and florid as this all is, though, it's hard at times to see its point. None of the characters are real at all: their two-dimensionality is of course an absolute given of the story's artistic premises. And while the grotesque tortures and killings initially shock, through extended repetition they begin to lose any sort of effect on your senses. After a while all you can do is react to the visual beauty of the compositions, and even that gets a bit dulled after a while. Probably this would have made an extremely effective (and equally gorgeous) short film.
B000NVIXFK|2.0|I've realized that Terry Brown was an integral member of the band that I grew up with, and without him the boys just don't work as well.  Their latest stuff like Snakes and Arrows, and Vapor Trails, is just too dense and monotonoous for me.  It's hard to find the melody and Geddy's voice sounds robotic.  There was power and excitement in 2112, A Farewell To Kings, Hemispheres, and my trio of back-to-back favorites, Permanent Waves/Moving Pictures/Signals.  Loud and sonically dense guitars don't equal excitement.  Soaring melodies, spine-tingling riffs (a la Spirit of Radio), dynamic drumming, and Geddy's rollercoaster bass are what made me a fan in the late 70's/early 80s.  Those elements have become scarcer and scarcer as time has gone by.  I think Alex felt that it was finally his turn to let loose after spending several albums providing simple chords to accompany Geddy's keyboards in the 90s.  Okay, so he proved he's still got skills.  Now let's get back to the progressive stuff that made them great.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I admit when I first saw the hybrid theory cd case years ago. I was not at all into LP's \\"kind\\" of music, but after hearing it a couple months later from a friend I was hooked.  I now have an LP collection.  I'm not a fanatic about rock, I do mostly hip hop and rap, but LP is what got me to start branching out. It is true that this cd is very different from previous work from LP, but that's not bad.  LP is taking real issues head on and speaking for the fans, the people and the troops.  To me that takes balls.  To me this cd is more than just heavy guitars and screaming; to me it has a voice that says \\"we care\\" we care enough to put our fame on the line and speak out on real issues.  So if you see this cd for what it is, then maybe you too can gain a \\"different\\" respect for it.
B000ASSDVA|5.0|This is a must for all those that appreciate Great Epics of a bygone era. This was Sofia Loren and Charlten Heston at their Prime. The cinematography is magnificent and the music (Miklos R) is hauntingly beautiful. This is the type of old time classic that one can see over and over again and find new things to satisfy and quench that desire to see a truly memorable motion picture. Pick it up today and you will see that it will inspire you to the zenith of your highest aspiration.<br /><br />Noel Serrano
B000NVIGC0|5.0|My opinion of this album, simply put, is that it is the album of 2007. Upon first listen, it seems mellow and some might call it boring and \\"unexperimental,\\" but these listeners are missing the point. You can't listen to Sky Blue Sky casually; it takes ambience and dedication. If you aren't hooked by the time the guitar solos on \\"Impossible Germany\\" are building up into magnificence, then maybe you just don't like Wilco enough.
B000MV9026|5.0|I purchased  this DVD for my 3 year old son.  He absolutely loves it.  He watches it very other night.  I have found myself watching very other night with him.  Everyone should own a copy of this DVD.  It's great!
0618680004|5.0|I really liked this book.  Why should we give special treatment to religion.  If someone told me that they have a black hole in their head I would think they were crazy (on second thought maybe they do) and would probably say something like \\"what are you talking about you don't have a black hole in your head\\".  Why can't we do that when someone says something about religion or a big guy in the sky, or the world is 10k years old or whatever?  Answer is not only can we but we should. It is of course not entirely provable that someone has a black hole (or doesn't for that matter) in their head, just as it isn't probable that there isn't a god.  Dawkins simply says that the preponderance of the evidence suggests that there isn't and believing otherwise is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> <br />Sure he can seem shrill and sometimes cruel but really given the number of deaths caused by religion and religion tolerance why should we not be furious and fighting to get rid of it?   <br /> <br />Truly a great and important book and one that I hope will help people see that even moderate religious people are dangerous. <br />
B000ASDFJU|5.0|The set is well-presented and put together. It's wonderful to have them all in one place. Best of all, no censorship and no advertisements! Total control, total enjoyment! This is how it's meant to be.
0142407380|4.0|i would say that ARK ANGEL is one of the better, but not the best alex rider books. Horowitz i believe is running out of ideas and he is therefore slowing down somewhat. this book is somewhat slow to begin, but picks up later on. i found it to be very similair to like a james bond movie. \\"moonraker\\" to be exact. this book was more traditonal than the last title \\"scorpia\\" wich i actually found to be my favorite in the series and coincidentally the longest as well. as i am getting older, i am starting to find these books kinda \\"cheesy\\". i guess i am losing intrest in the whole child secret agent thing. if you really want some instant action though, these are the books for you. i kinda like to have somewhat of a subplot though. this book doesnt really have one. it is very straight forward and that is what makes these alex rider books great for young readers or people who simply need a fun book often finding that you \\"have\\" to read somthing.  <br />      now, what had set this book apart from the others? well, nothing. thats why i didnt give it five stars. anthony horowitz is really desperate to grab the readers attention so he uses \\"explosive\\" action. in saying this, i mean like guns and killing and death. sure it is good for like two books, but after there have been five or so, it gets old. fortunatly, horowitz can still recover, but we'll just have to see in whatever he writes next.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|THIS IS THE WAY BOND WAS IN THE BOOKS. MORE REAL THAN THE OTHERS.
B000MR9D5E|2.0|Yes, there are some very good things about this series. The camera work amazing. Many stunning examples of life on planet Earth were captured...BUT I was largely disappointed by this series because of the many things it left out, and its highly repetitive, cursory treatment of those few topics it did cover. <br /> <br />As a microbiologist I know that there are some fabulous images and videos of microscope life out there for the taking. Most of our planet is unseen by the naked eye. There isn't even an episode devoted to this most important aspect of Earth.  <br /> <br />The life forms that are included could have been fitted into two or three episodes. Watching all the episodes you get a sense of deja vu and annoyance as you realize you've already seen these shots of the shark in slow motion five times before with much of the same dialogue. You've already seen the polar regions...why are you back there again! Rather than sticking with one creature's story, the editing skips around within episodes and between them, as if designed for people with attention spans of a two year-old.
B000AA305M|5.0|I love this CD and every song that is on the CD!! David Gray is not sold at Target stores in my area. To find the time to track a Borders or a Barnes and Knoble that sells CD's is too much of my time wasted in my day. So I went to Amazon.com and ordered the CD on a Thursday night. I selected standard shipping and received my CD on Monday. I am planning on purchasing more of his CD's and will do so on Amazon.com.
B000B0WO0I|5.0|Stripped down jazzy slower versions of old songs from The SImply Red catalog. Fans LOVE things like this, I LOVE this album, perfect for a rainy day alone with some songs that are like old friends. But older, wiser, mature, just wonderful. I Simply LOVE the stripped and simplified version of \\"Fairground\\", I love the orginial dearly...the sad slow melody over the Goodmen's drumming. But here it is sung as a ballad. This could have been an old standard that someone like Ella Fitzgerlad would have sung. can't say enough good things aabout this album, it is called \\"Simplified\\", but should be called \\"Timeless\\". This is the Greatest Hits for the fans, hits ethought. Again, rain falling outside makes this even better. Then again, we are all SR fans here, give it a try.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Yes, it won Best Picture and a lot of other awards.  Yes, a lot of critics praised it (although not as enthusiastically you might think).  And many people decry the movie as a lesser-work by Scorsese that the Academy awarded out of guilt, especially since \\"Dances with Wolves\\" beat \\"Goodfellas\\" for Best Picture in 1990 (WTF!).  And because a lot of people still don't like Leonardo DiCaprio and all the big Hollywood names attached, they also shrug it off somewhat. Not to mention the fact that it's a remake of a really good movie, \\"Infernal Affairs\\".   <br /> <br />There's so many reasons to want to think this is just okay, until you actually watch the movie.  It's unbelievably good, right up there with Scorsese's best work, and although I often disagree with the Academy, I really do believe it was the Best Picture of 2006.  The film is so rich with wonderful, powerful performances across the board, and the script is so entertaining and tense, filled with dynamic, hilarious characters and scenes that just jump out at you.  It's a violent crime film in line with \\"Goodfellas\\", \\"Taxi Driver\\" and Scorsese's other greatest hits in a way, but I think on many other levels it's a departure for him.  Stylistically, it's much more of a police procedural along the lines of some of the great television shows out these days like \\"The Wire\\" and \\"The Shield\\".  It's also respectful of the source material, offering a different enough take on \\"Infernal Affairs\\" but staying true to some of the best that film had to offer.   <br /> <br />I saw this movie three times in the theater.  I haven't done that in a long, long time (probably since \\"Goodfellas\\").  I bought the DVD, I love it, and I think time will be very good to \\"The Departed\\" overall.  The Leo-hate will finally be forgotten, as will the politics and the context of the Hollywood A-listers piling on, and we'll just be left with one of the most entertaining crime movies ever made.  And the fact that it's an entertainment and not a grandiose, Oscar-shilling \\"important film\\" is what makes it all the more successful and truly a great pleasure to watch.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|awesome film, nothing cheeky about this JB.
B00000JGHM|3.0|havnt watched in forever but i remember i really liked it. i didnt see much interplay between deniro and pacino. seemed just ok. i was rooting for deniro the whole movie! then they freakin kill him at the end? pacino shoulda got shot. the robbery scene was awesome. i love how kilmers wife saved him. i like how amy decides to give deniro a chance. deniro got greedy and wanted to off that guy. he shoulda got away with it. thats the only thing that killed the movie for me or else 5 stars.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and i recommend that every man and woman watch this and you will learn how to succeed.
B000065R29|5.0|Is this another of Amazon's DVD language oversights? For the single DVD version of In the Mood for Love they list the film's language as ENGLISH! YET the language of the Criterion version (which is more than double the price of the single version and that Amazon sells) the language is listed correctly as Cantonese.  <br /> <br />What gives with Amazon  - is the Criterion in Cantonese and the single DVDs in English? Qing!(Please!)
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This album is brilliant and gets better the more you listen to it. It is definitely different than the first two albums, but that is exactly why I respect Linkin Park for taking a chance to deliver something different this time <br />Great job! Great rock album. <br />
B00005T30L|5.0|i was hiking at griffith park in los angeles and when i got home this was playing on showtime. i loved it. first of all thora and scarlett are really hot. being as i collect stuff too i related with steve buscemi character who is a very talented funny actor. i think enid is hotter than scarlett but they are both at their peak here. the whole tone of the movie was very funny to me. the ending was cool, some say she killed herself but i just think she went to a strange place to start a new life like she wanted to. a personal fav.
1401907725|5.0|These cards are phenomenal!  I fell in love with them the second I held them in my hands!  The art work is wonderful and the messages are comforting and always appropriate to the situation or question being asked.  I consult them a couple of times a day and depend on them to guide me.  These are a must have!
B000NA1OXY|3.0|When I first heard her new single, Girlfriend, everyone had started to say that Avril was selling out. But, I loved the song and bought this CD anyways, and I have to say, it was a disappointment. There's only about 4 songs on the album that I can stand listening to without stopping them a minute in; When You're Gone, Runaway, Innocence, and Keep Holding On. Most of the songs, like I Don't Have To Try, makes you wonder why a 22 year old married singer is releasing songs that should have been on her first album when she was a teenager. Some of the songs just don't fit her age, and quite honestly, they make her sound immature. If anything, most of these songs should have been released by a teenage artist, not Avril. <br /> <br />Overall, the CD is worth getting for the 4-5 actual good songs. But if you're expecting this album to be like her last one, Under My Skin, don't even waste your money.
B000MRA5EM|1.0|well i recently bought this dvd thinking it would be imax 3d.... because i searched just plain old 3d in the searchbar and this was the third on the list... the problem with this is, amazon copied what deep sea 3d had on the summary for ImDb... WELL ITS NOT 3d.. So dont buy it expecting 3d... I wish i would have not been tricked into it, though i should have noticed the signs... its just it shouldnt come up if you search for 3d movies................... thats all i have to say... other than that its a good movie, im just mad they sold it as 3d as it says in the plot!!!
B00005JPO8|5.0|First off, the beauty of this film to me was that one could have a both fairly cerebral and emotional reaction to this movie rather easily.  I mean that in the best of ways.  \\"The lives of others\\" starts out with the decision of the state to monitor a playwrite, for reason's that are not exactly the purest.  But soon stasi (secret police) member Gerd takes sympathy with those he is forced to watch, and according to some, seems to fall in love with their lives. The plot thickens as a article written by a secret east german writer appears in the west, who the goverment believe to the character of Georg who is already under watch.  Thought the rest of the movie, Gerd takes action to make sure that Georg is protected from the over zealous hammer of authority.  One can only wish we met such people more often.  Without giving away the rest of the plot, a great deal of drama, wonderful acting, and a amazing background setting(I must find out where this is filmed!).  One of the wonderful things I took away from this movie, was seeing the person make the choice of using his ethics and heart, rather than excusing himself with the old failed defense of \\"taking orders\\".  Any serious fan of film would be doing themselves a great diservice to miss one of the best films i've seen in quite a long time.<br /><br />Hopefully, things will get together and the DVD will be realised here in the next month.  I think this film is worthy of a criterion release as well, hopefully they notice it, although I imagine with a spiffy DVD or not, i'll be buying this movie soon after it is released.
0380789035|2.0|How could this have won a nebula award?  My how far we have fallen.<br /><br />The characters and events are utterly unbelievable and one dimensional.  Worse is there any character that has, well, character in this novel?<br /><br />It is filled with foul language and unnecessary and graphic sexual content. The heroes are all idols and devils.  The ugly profane and evil are glorified.  I'm amazed I actually read the entire book, and that is perhaps why I gave it as much as 2 stars.  The author manages a clever enough plot-line to serve as a distraction whilst squatting on the toilet or waiting in a doctor's office.
B00005JPFF|2.0|Loved the first 2 ... the third is a dissapointment
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This is probably one of the best series I've seen in a while. The two characters, \\"Sam\\" and \\"Dean\\" have such amazing chemistry together as actors. The acting and special effects are top notch. And the storyline always keeps you interested. Also, although the story is somewhat serious and scary, they always seem to find room for a lot of humorous moments. Also, some of the special features on this DVD include outakes that are absolutely hilarious! I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone!
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I won't go into a rant, but four years is a long time to wait for a third album. LP is definatley one of my favorite bands but this isn't what I was expecting. I thought with their maturity as a band, the time given between albums and with Rick Ruben producing that this would be there masterpiece. It isn't, not even close.  <br /> <br />Mr. Hahn is no where to be found on this whole album, there is no electronica-rock-rap that make LP distinct. Mike barely raps, it seems that he took all of his ryhmes and used them for Fort Minor, and what we have left it a sappy ballad album. I won't be holding my breath for four more years for the next album.
0143036556|4.0|In \\"Collapse\\", Diamond discusses the reasons why some societies that thrived initially, collapsed subsequently.  His new book covers the opposite phenomenon than his previous bestseller \\"Guns, Germs and Steele\\" where Diamond explained why certain societies rose to dominance and conquered other societies.  The underlying reasons for the rise to power and collapse of societies, however, appear to be much the same; environmental factors.  While societies advance because of proximity to fertile land and livestock, damage to these two from pollution, deforestation etc. is the chief culprit for regress.  Diamond introduces a few new non-environmental factors into his equation he calls the five-point framework, including, but not limited to friendly or hostile neighbors.    Early in the book, Diamond focuses on the two societies of Montana and Easter Island.  He attributes the decline of Montana's economy from one of the richest states to one of the poorest, and the decimation of the population of Easter Island to the decline of fertile land for agriculture and deforestation.  Both of these societies are in areas that are suboptimal for farming, and therefore, not conducive to recovering from manmade damages resulting from over-mining in Montana's case and deforestation in Easter Island's.    Montana, however, managed to survive because of its trade and close proximity to its neighbors.  Half of Montana's economy is directly tied to sources out of the state.  Easter Island, as one of the most isolated land masses on earth suffered a worse fate.  Later, Diamond makes a similar case for Greenland's demise partly attributed to its near out of reach distance to Denmark, its chief supplier of scarce resources such as Iron and timber.  In Greenland's case, Diamond parts with his central environmental theme by asserting that had the Greenland Norse learned the Inuits' (Eskimos) superior hunting skills, they may not have suffered such a dire fate.    In part 3 of the book, Diamondreturns to the modern world, analyzing the prospects of Rwanda, Haiti, The Dominican Republic, China, Japan, and saves his most scathing review for Australia.  Not surprisingly, the belief of the Australian Institute of Public Affairs, a conservative think-tank, is that Diamond's claims of severe environmental degradation in that country are not supported by evidence and are easily disproved.    Diamond claims he does not harbor an exclusively pessimistic view of the future.  Yet, in the last chapter he discusses 12 major environmental problems facing modern societies and asserts that all 12 require solutions or else we are well on a path of limiting our lifestyle in the next several decades.  To solve all 12 problems adequately and expeditiously would require a colossal political and personal sacrifice that is near impossible.    The 12 \\"environmental\\" problems Diamond discusses in the last chapter also open him up to charges of environmental determinism yet again, which he strives to avoid throughout the book.  These charges were first leveled against him in Guns, Germs and Steel.  Understandably, he goes to great length to avoid the same fate, but alas, his effort to summarize lessons from the past to avoid collapses of the future pertain to environmental factors almost exclusively.    Joseph Tainter provides an excellent alternative view to Diamond's in \\"The Collapse of Complex Societies\\" written in 1988.  Diamond debunks some of Tainter's theories, but recommends his book as supplemental reading.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Thes series is visually stunning on blue ray.  It is also some of the most stunning cinnemaphotography that I have ever seen. It is informative and intertaining at the same time. It is well worth the money.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Minutes to Midnight has a blend of everything except for country. Instead of their generic rock-rap version on every track of their past few cds, they decided to go with something different. And I praise them for it. I don't see why so many people hate this album and were so quick to write such bad reviews. Anyways, get this album!! It's better than anything else out this summer.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Breath taking, lots of action, absolutley the best Bond movie ever!
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I usually never review CDs, but I'm shocked with this album. I can't believe they thought it was GOOD and actually put it out there. I am a huge fan of LP, I've loved all of their other CDs, almost every single song: they had good music, good guitars, good mixture of hard and soft sounds, good mixture of slow singing and rap and the heavy head banging parts. And most of all... I've ALWAYS LOVED THE LYRICS!!! So this CD... some songs are completely slow where you can't even tell that the hook/chorus is even happening. Others have terrible melody (they always used to be so melodic and deep). The parts w/ fort minor, they just gave him the whole songs and it doesn't sound as good. I know they just wanted to please him since he complained about the band in his solo album, but still... it doesn't have LP sound if the whole song is just sung by fort minor (rap) and the chorus is a heavy head banging part.  <br /> <br />Overall, you know how LP's songs are usually really catchy and you played the old albums out to extremes? Well, not with this one. I made this CD... my friends and I heard it once or twice and put it away, to the point that I never want to hear it again. I have no Favorite songs on there, some songs are DECENT... but not CATCHY and not MEMORABLE at all. AND the icing on the cake... the LYRICS are stupid and not interesting. They're just babbling about struggles and fighting, and totally not LP style! <br /> <br />Basically, they wanted to go a different direction so they wouldn't always sound the same, and sadly it just didn't work...

B000OMD4BG|3.0|It's like flipping through a high school yearbook and remembering how sweet it was.  Make no mistake though, \\"New Moon\\" is a good but not great album.  They're outtakes for a reason and most songs lack the immediacy Elliott Smith's 1994-97 work.  That being said, the ghost of \\"Either/Or\\" magnificently haunt this release and you'd swear you've heard these tunes before.  It's all here: the confessional lyrics, the signature and effortless double-tracked vocals, and the intricate guitar work that sets Elliott Smith apart from the hundreds of heartbroken singer-songwriters frequenting independent coffeeshops.   <br /> <br />As a posthumous release, \\"New Moon\\" rates fairly strongly in this genre.  It might not dig into your brain like Elliott Smith's proper \\"studio\\" releases but if you've been wearing out \\"Either/Or\\" on those late summer nights, this album will fit into the rotation nicely.  Ultimately, however, the release only serves to cement Elliott's unfortunate inclusion with yesteryear's pantheon of Janis, Jim, Jimi, and Nick (as well as the current generation's class alums Kurt and Jeff) as the giants who were cut down in the prime of life.

B000NA1OXY|3.0|I was excited when I found out that Avril was going to be releasing her third album - even more when I found out that \\"Keep Holding On\\" (fron the Eragon soundtrack) was going to be included.<br /><br />Then I found a website that was streaming the album for free.  I listened - and thought, \\"this isn't worth buying for just six songs that I like\\".<br /><br />So I downloaded the songs - \\"Keep Holding On\\", \\"Runaway\\", \\"When You're Gone\\", \\"Hot\\", \\"Innocence\\", & \\"Contagious\\" - the three ballads and the only three upbeat songs I liked.<br /><br />I give this three stars because of the ballads (the highlight on this okay album, and the kind of song that Avril does best).<br /><br />Ironically, there's songs on this album titled \\"I Don't Have To Try\\", \\"I Can Do Better\\", and \\"The Best Damn Thing\\"....Yes, Avril, you \\"don't have to try\\" hard to make an album like this.  Yes, you \\"can do better\\"...but you're NOT \\"the best damn thing\\" - yet.  If you put some more effort (and some more ballads) on your next CD, you will be.<br /><br />I like Avril Lavigne, but her new album is her worst.  Don't buy this, just download the songs you like and hope that she \\"can do better\\" on her next CD.
0618680004|1.0|I am a philosophy major, and these claims are absurd and entirely without merit. Trying to use reality to disprove the existence of God does not work, and his arguments are full of contradictions. There is no explanation for more metaphysical realities that Aristotle and Plato spoke of and that St. Thomas Aquinas proved (Good, Being, Truth, One). This is just another attempt at a botched atheist philosophy.  <br /> <br />He assigns attributes to reality based upon his interpretation and completely disregarding the principle of non-contradiction. He completely and entirely misreads St. Thomas's proofs for God by assigning his own misunderstanding of terms to the text instead of looking at it ontologically. This man is no more a philosopher and a writer than a stubborn child who cannot have his own way.

It contains a lot of powerful and positive information to help you focus on your career, relationships, finances, etc. When I am having a challenging day or moment, reading this book helps to lift me up and get me grounded again.  I strongly believe in karma and the impact the universe has on us.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants the best out of life and how to get it. Thank you Rhonda Byrne!!!

B000O178BY|5.0|Phillip Glass, eat your heart out! It's all but official, Trent Reznor has qualified himself as a minimalist rock star, which may have earn him a place in music history textbooks. Here are a few things to expect: <br /> <br />- You will hear things you had never heard before on this album well beyond one hundred listens. <br />- Very complicated beats that are constantly changing. <br />- Noise! Lots and lots of highly orchestrated noise! <br /> <br />Pretty dynamic stuff!  The political message is pretty intense too.

0618551050|4.0|If you are an outsider like me with no stake in any particular theory but often find physics fascinating then by all means read \\"[[ASIN:0375708111 The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory]]\\" by Brian Greene and read this book too.  I enjoyed them both.  Anyone interested in yet suspicious of string theory could certainly enjoy both.  With its unifying potential one should be interested in it.  With its lack of experimental evidence one should be suspicious of it.  The author of \\"The Trouble with Physics\\" does not appear to me to have an axe to grind.  He does not appear to be a bitter rival (of the string section).  He appears to be positive minded and he appears to be very fair in his assessments.  Taking him at his word, he appreciates the promise of string theory.  He thinks it provides evidence for the existence of a fundamental theory.  He thinks it provides an excellent concept for unifying particles and forces.  Even given all his concerns he wouldn't want string theory abandoned.  However he thinks the prospects of string \\"theory\\" leading to a unique theory that can make predictions that can be tested and confirmed anytime in the foreseeable future are slim.  If this were the sole focus of physics, then physics won't make any scientific advances in the foreseeable future.    Assuming string theory isn't going to prove itself anytime soon then I think it's in everyone's interest to dim the spotlight.  If not, then I see two possible prospects for string theory.  The first is that it burns itself out in a crash of faith and the pendulum swings the other way.  This isn't good for those who see truth (or at least potential) in the strings.  The second is that society stops requiring the use of the scientific method.  A fan of science like me doesn't like thinking that the \\"Scientific Age\\" might soon come to an end.  Smolin doesn't have such pessimistic thoughts.  He goes on to talk of theories that can make testable predictions.  He concludes by suggesting that all areas of research including strings would benefit from having some more individuals who are independent thinkers.  These types are often oddball loners who often don't have the professional or technical savvy of their colleagues.  Smolin suggests the system disfavors them.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|What once used to be a band of rap/rockers has now become something that no one will ever be able to question their creative talent any longer.  What is more impressive than making a record that basicallt says, \\"Here's four tracks to satisfy the hard rockers, but look at what else we've created.\\"?  Some say there's some close resemblance to Nine Inch Nails or U2, but how is that a knock to want to be like either of those two?  What you have is a band at a crossroad and they have taken the correct path when they came to the fork in their road.  Where they go from here will be the question.  Either way, this CD will eventually stand out as their best work.  If this CD does not move up into the Top 5 of you whole collection would baffle me.
B000J103OI|3.0|Has Meryl Streep ever given a poor performance? If she has, I haven't seen it. You find yourself disliking Miranda Priestly, played by Streep, in very short order. And I think Anne Hathaway, who plays the green journalist Andrea Sachs, is slowly coming on as a convincing actress in her own right. Emily Blunt is hilarious as the first assistant who jealously teaches Sachs the ropes of waiting hand and foot on Priestly. And I can't forget the always solid Stanley Tucci. This is definitely a coming of age story with the standard be-yourself ending. Although you can predict its direction, the performances were strong and the movie has a happy ending.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Great Flick. THe extras on the DVD also a must for any serious Bond fan. Hail the new Bond - Daniel Craig.
B0002KPIQY|3.0|In this true life portrayal of Gia Marie Carangi's life, Angeline Jolie lays the ground work for her monumental arrival to the big screen. I think with this film, Jolie establishes herself as the most courageous actress to grace the scene in quite some time. On another note, it's sad that someone as beautiful as Gia Carangi struggled with so many demons. You never know what's going on in someone's mind. In any event, Angelina Jolie is magnificent!
B000OCZ0ZO|4.0|Let me first start off by saying that when I first popped this CD into my computer I was scared. As a LP fan I looked up reviews (including on Amazon.com) and based on those reviews it wasn't looking too good. I started to think that maybe I wasted my $25. I heard that the sound of this album would be different from their previous ones and that people weren't receptive to it. Well, I must say that I love this album and it's quite possibly my favorite LP album by far. I can listen to the album without skipping a track, although some songs, in my opinion, are better than others. Leave Out All the Rest doesn't quite do it for me, but it's listenable. My favorite song,ironically, is more reminiscent of their older stuff: Bleed It Out. It's just a really feel good song.  <br /> <br />Minutes to Midnight is definitely different than any of their other stuff and I think they did a pretty good job of doing something different while still keeping the essence of who they are. It doesn't surprise me the mixed reviews that the album's gotten. It's definitely an album you'll either love or hate. You'll either appreciate the new direction they've taken or wish that they did something similar to Hybrid Theory and Meteora. I would encourage people to try to check out the songs for yourself and not just rely on the opinions of other people. If you can listen to it for free (or want to take the chance and just buy it) you should do it and judge for yourself whether it's a good album or not.  <br /> <br />Personally, I think the album is awesome. 4 stars!!!!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I think what's most intriguing about this piece is it's coherent delivery. Who would've thought of Al Gore as legitimately funny? And how often do political types inform us without boring us to death first? Exactly; not often! Although he's still a bit wooden in this documentary, it works. Whether you believe the information or not, it will at least stimulate questions. Watch it and enjoy!
0307237699|4.0|I have never voted for a democratic candidate for any political office in my entire life.  I am not a republican either, I tend to vote more for the Libertarian Party. <br /> <br />That being said, I found that this book was a fascinating read into the issues of the day which presents viewpoints which on some issues I agree with and on others I found myself shaking my head when I read the book (like the idea of paying a teacher $100K a year - for only 6 to 7 months of real work). <br /> <br />However, based upon the fact that Obama is running for president I am not sure how much of this book is his real thoughts or how much is political propoganda.  But if the author is genuine in his viewpoints presented in the book, I will vote for him for president.  He seems to have the capacity to think before he acts and see what decisions he makes through to their logical conclusions and to determine what the consequences of those decisions will be not just in the short term but in the long term as well, which is more than can be said for the current and previous administrations.

0618680004|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing.  Richard Dawkins is fearless in his attack on the dangerous institution of religion.  He uses real life examples of how religion has destroyed lives, and he dissects the nonsensical arguments that the fundamentalists use in their attempts to control people.  I especially liked how he used a scientific approach to the subject, saying that his main reason for not believing in God is that God is very \\"unlikely.\\"  He uses great arguments such as \\"irreducible complexity\\" to argue against the less logical arguments presented by his opponents. <br /> <br />Coming from a fundamentalist upbringing where we were taught that all nonbelievers were evil and that our \\"loving God\\" was sending them all to hell because they didn't believe, I felt empowered after reading this book.   <br /> <br />If God existed, I'd say that this book was a God-send.  But since God doesn't exist, I'll just say that its an amazing book that hopefully will change the direction of our national dialogue.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|After dozens of Bond films and many stars as Bond, a certain sameness of plots and stunts begins to set in. The gadget are more fantastic but less emotionally appealing, the special effects overpower the story and the viewing expectations are lowered. A Bond film, you say. Gadgets, girls, garish plots and bad guys and lots of movie violence-ho hum.  <br />  Not this film! This Bond is muscular physically and in on screen presence.The plot is fast, real and exciting. Every detail seemed important to the film and the outrageous stunts and very primal fights made Bond more believable and almost compelling. Watch once, never forget it! I could not keep my eyes off the screen and liked this film more than any Bond in years-even the Connery Bond films. A Must Have Film!!! Longer, but at the end I was sorry it was over.

I enjoyed reading a book all about one of those total wackos because you meet them sometimes and wonder what their life could possibly be all about.  Very amusing although I didn't really laugh out loud. I can't say parts of the book weren't disgusting, but hey. A quick read.
0143034901|5.0|If your looking for a good time, this is the book.  I thoroughly enjoyed every moment I spent reading it, which was not long enough.  I didn't have any expections when I picked it up other than a decent story.  I was in for surprise.  It's been a long time since I've laughed out loud while reading, and found characters as fun and interesting as those found between these pages.  The story was fast-paced and never lagged.  The ending was gratifying and I felt satisfied in the end.  I plan on starting it over again because I'm sure there are charms I missed.  Enjoy!

B000MTPANQ|5.0|I first encountered Neil Young as a disaffected teenager many years ago.  Young offered the perfect sounding board and also the perfect panacea for my (somewhat) tortured soul.  It is a testament to the power of Young's music, however, that decades later I still can enjoy these songs not simply as nostalgic traces of my youth, but the works of one of the great folk poetic talents of our time.  In the terms of the critical genre, the songs of his early years are hardly \\"dated.\\"  They are still vibrant.<br /><br />The first album of Young's that I encountered years ago was \\"Harvest,\\" so it is particularly significant to me, as I am sure to many others who were initially captured by that groundbreaking album, that this concert was recorded shortly before the album came out.  A number of the songs from the album appear here in what undoubtedly were one of their first performances: \\"Old Man,\\" \\"A Man Needs a Maid,\\" \\"Heart of Gold,\\" \\"There's a World,\\" \\"The Needle and the Damage Done.\\"  It is interesting that \\"Heart of Gold\\" is performed intermeshed with \\"A Man Needs a Maid,\\" performed on the piano.  The former on \\"Harvest\\" is performed on guitar, and it seems after \\"Harvest\\" the obvious means of performance, but one wonders whether it was originally composed on piano.  Also there's an interested lyrical discrepancy in \\"Maid\\": the first chorus refers to a man being \\"afraid.\\"<br /><br />Other songs included come from Young's earlier repertoire (\\"Tell Me Why,\\" \\"Don't Let it Bring You Down,\\" \\"Down by the River\\") or ones that didn't reach vinyl until after \\"Harvest\\" (\\"Love in Mind,\\" \\"Journey through the Past\\").  All are compelling performances.<br /><br />I bought the CD/DVD version (rather than simply the CD) since I generally in the past years have enjoyed viewing concerts rather than listening to studio music.  A word of caution here: this is not a professional quality video of the concert.  Clearly two cameras were used, and the camera(men/women?) had stage access, but the lighting is poor and the camera work rather amateurish.  On a number of songs there are no shots of the performance at all.  In some such cases, perhaps because equipment failed, the original producer of this footage took the somewhat whimsical, though at times tiresome, measure of photographing an active tape player on the stool in front of the piano or in the midst of Young's guitars.  In other cases we get some footage of Young on his newly purchased ranch.  There's also the problem of getting a good face shot of Young (as fans know, he had long hair then that revealed only the center of his face).  But all in all I still enjoyed the DVD visuals.  There's enough here to get a feel of the live performance.<br /><br />In sum, a wonderful offering from a music legend.

I used it so much, in so many diverse climates that I ultimately wore down the keys, so I bought another after 10 years...10 years passed and I bought another. Sooooo, there was no way I could resist the Platinum Anniversary Edition with its subtle improvements and gorgeous storage case.

0385340559|5.0|I have to preface this by admitting that I'm a literary snob. The last two books I reviewed on this site were for [[ASIN:0385509634 The Ruby in Her Navel]] and [[ASIN:0618894640 The Children of Hurin]].<br /><br />Lee Child, the author of Bad Luck and Trouble, said in an interview with Craig Ferguson that Jack Reacher is the \\"toughest man in literature.\\" I would not call Child's Reacher Series \\"literature.\\" And Child, the man who helped produce the brilliant adaptations of [[ASIN:B00005JLG2 Brideshead Revisited]] and [[ASIN:B000053VA4 The Jewel in the Crown]], must know that too. In fact, one might say Child has invented a new kind of genre: Fantasy Detective Thriller. Because the character of Jack Reacher is so preposterously studly (and ridiculously confident), and gets into so many insane adventures (and kills so many bad guys), that he could only live in the same make-believe world as [[ASIN:B00005JLF2 24]].<br /><br />In this novel Reacher can thwart a big man's powerful haymaker punch merely by catching it in one of his giant hands. Or he can hear the barely audible \\"click\\" of a bullet as it enters a gun's chamber (from twenty feet away, no less) on a Las Vegas street. He can put together a Molotov cocktail from stuff bought at a Quickie Mart while musing thoughtfully upon the fascinating history of that diabolical invention. And he can break a man's neck with a one-handed-hair-grab move that would have made Bruce Lee bow his head in awe.<br /><br />I have to admit, however, that once I start reading these books I cannot put the damn things down. I bought this one today at an independent and fairly snooty bookshop. The owner gleefully told me that he'd already read an advance copy weeks ago and loved it. I promptly took it to a nearby coffee shop where I lost all track of time (I usually have an uncanny Jack Reacher-like internal clock) and ended up getting a thirty dollar parking ticket. By the time evening rolled around I was so hooked I actually contemplating reading the book while walking the dog. I finally finished after about eight hours of nearly continuous reading and was thoroughly entertained every step of the way. Lee Child is infuriatingly good at what he does.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|This album sure is a new style for Linkin Park.  That being said, I really like it!  There are a few songs on this album that are somewhat similar to their past two albums - like \\"Given Up\\", \\"Bleed it out\\", and \\"What I've Done\\", which are all great songs.  A number of the songs on this album also seem to have profound, and political meanings behind them - some of which might be considered controversial.  I really think this album is a step forward for Linkin Park, and I really love the messages and energy they put into Minutes to Midnight. <br /> <br />While this album may not be for some of the more shallow Linkin Park fans, I would certainly recommend this album to anyone who considers intellectually motivated lyrics put together with awesome musical compositions a great work of art.  In all honesty, this is quickly becoming my favorite Linkin Park album!

But this album is equally inclined to wallow in miserable lite folk-rock like \\"Half a World Away\\", \\"Low\\" or \\"Belong\\".

0385340559|5.0|I love Jack Reacher books.  He is an expert sniper.  He is an expert at ballistics.  He is an expert criminologist.  He has no equal in unarmed combat.  etcetera etcetera.<br /><br />But in this book he becomes an expert of math?  OK...he isn't solving linear algebra equations or doing theoretical mathematics, but he has an unhealthy love of prime numbers and number patterns.  And this just sprung up out of no where.  In previous books, he has made some pretty amazing shots.  A good working knowledge of geometry, windage, elevations, etc. are all good traits for a sniper, which he is since he won a coveted marine sniper competition.  But this new ability just kind of caught me by surprise.<br /><br />With that out of the way, this is a great book.  I read it one sitting as I do all Jack Reacher novels.  He didn't make as many \\"leaps of logic\\" this time as he did in previous books.  Primarily because he has help this time around.  His old special M.P. squad is helping him out.  And each one had a skill that came in handy right when he needed it.  One is super rich.  One figured out a password that no one else could.  One is even better at math then he is.  So Jack didn't have to solve everything himself.<br /><br />He does go a bit darker in this book.  He steals money from \\"corner boys\\" (the kids on the street that sell), and the way it is described makes it sound like he has done it many times before.  I guess he figures it is a victimless crime because the person purchasing the drugs isn't going to come forward, and the person being robbed surely isn't going to come forward.  Of course it comes back and bites him later.<br /><br />A few other actions in the book make me think that Mr. Child is going to start exploring the darker side of being a drifter.  I'm actually looking forward to that tangent.  Even with all his super human skills, it would be nice to see Jack actually have to struggle and have some moral dilemmas every once and awhile.
B0000028UK|5.0|It's a toss up for this reviewer which of Pearl Jam's first 2 albums is the better one.  Ten and Vs. are different and you can sense that Vs. is a wee bit more commercial but that doesn't stop this from achieving gem status.  Packed with hits like Animal, Daughter, Dissident and the like, this is not a good album, it's GREAT.  If you are a Pearl Jam fan who caught on later you might be a little surprised because nearly everything they have done since their first 2 albums hasn't been that fabulous, but you owe it to yourself to pick up this gem, crank up those headphones and enjoy early 90s grunge rock like it was meant to be heard!!!<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

B000N6TX1I|5.0|It bothers me to no end that people give low ratings because they didn't understand the ending. <br />I don't know how else to put it except to say, \\"Sorry you suffer from a low attention span and/or low IQ.\\" There are several snippets in various dialogues that show the importance of what happens at the end. If you don't pay attention, the ending could be misconstrued as being 'pointless'. It was ANYTHING but pointless.  <br />I guess some people would have liked a \\"... and six months later\\" ending, but there is NO NEED and would have killed the BEAUTIFUL ambience the film creates. The film rolls along its intricate multi-faceted thought-provoking plot in perfect timing to an ending that gave me shivers down my spine. <br /> <br />The most beautiful piece of film making in a LONG time. Forget everything that Hollywood has taught you to expect from movies and maybe you can appreciate this film for the work of art that it is. This is storytelling at its greatest.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Dave and the boys are back with a fierce metal release that'll kick your ass to the back of the room. This is the first output from Megadeth since the new lineup consisting of Shawn and Glen Drover (fellow Canucks!) on drums and guitars, respectively, and bassist James Lomenzo. I've seen that lineup live twice already and they come close to the magic of the classic lineup of \\"Rust in Peace\\"; actually, they're probably the next best thing to.<br /><br />\\"United Abominations\\" features politically charged lyrics and is filled with shredding guitar solos. The band had already released demos of two songs through their website, \\"Sleepwalker\\" (a kick-ass opening track) and \\"Gears of War\\", soon to become an arena anthem with that pounding chorus. Another song we've had a chance to hear before the album's release which they performed last year on Gigantour, is \\"Washington is Next\\", a head banger's delight. The title cut opens with a newscast foreboding the onslaught that is about to come in the following seconds; a very powerful song indeed, one of the highlights of the album. The gem of the CD is without a doubt the duet of Dave and Cristina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil on Megadeth's now classic \\"A Tout Le Monde\\". Their voices go really well together and give the song an even more haunting feeling than before. Other standout tracks include \\"Blessed Are the Dead\\" and \\"Burnt Ice\\". Overall, Mustaine has crafted some of the best lyrics of his career--an impressive one at that--and still comes up with clever word plays (Jihad Joe comes to mind) and the new band performs so tight collectively, you'd think they've been together for years.<br /><br />The album cover and booklet are just amazing with an updated version of Vic for the tough times ahead. Whether you lost interest in Megadeth in the late nineties or whether you've been there since day one, \\"United Abominations\\" delivers the goods aplenty. I was worried it wouldn't compare to the excellent \\"The System Has Failed\\", but it stands strong and victorious. Whoever thought old school metal was dead can take this CD for a spin. Long live Megadeth!stands strong and victorious. Whoever thought old school metal was dead can take this CD for a spin. Long live Megadeth!

Happy happy day for me.  ANd I used these with my now grown kids. They go step by step and start with like a circle and then add the ears and he creates so many fun books. The thumbprint books of his are fun activities to do with your children that any age loves, it is just too much fun, pretty soon the neighbors will be dropping in because they heard of the Emberly fun going on at your house. All of his books are marvelous, just get one and you will be sold !!!!!
B000EMGJM2|5.0|Others have given better reviews and descriptions of this album. But I must say that this guy is really talented and I hope you soul music lovers out there will check this album out. He uses various different musical styles to good effect(not too many artists can pull that off when you think about it). I love \\"Character\\", \\"Being a Girl\\" (I'm surprised I haven't heard this playing on the radio), and \\"If I Take You Home\\" (this track is strangely reminds me of a Prince record). I stumbled on this album and I strongly recommend it.
1878424319|5.0|I love this book.  \\"The Four Agreements\\" provides knowledge that stands outside the realm of time.  Don Miguel Ruiz writes that I should be impeccable with my word - say only what I mean and to be kind and gentle with myself.  I've found that life has become more effortless when I don't make promises to myself that I know I'm not going to keep.  Keeping my word with myself has been a powerful discovery.  This book is grounded in integrity.  I find that as I go through my life with integrity, the Universe supports my life choices.<br /><br />Authors Ariel & Shya Kane have also taught me the magic of living my life with integrity.  In their book \\"How to Create a Magical Relationship\\", they share simple & practical principles that have helped me discover well-being by living in the moment. I find that when I am present with what is happening in my life, I act appropriately and spontaneously to the situation at hand.  And when I keep my word with myself, I get to see the gift of my integrity.  Check out the Kanes - their information is timeless and new at the same time.
B00000I07R|5.0|BonJovi can be mis-labeled as typical heavy-metal boiler-factory decibel-bashing rock band vying for a top spot on the charts & in the music stores.  But if Any Album atests to this group's deep well of Talent, it is \\"Keep the Faith\\". BonJovi very impressively runs the gamut here from Blues to Ted Nugent' level of intense rock, & ballards even varied in theme from bruised love to emotional uplift.  \\"In life there comes a rain, but you gotta keep the faith\\".  Life at everyday angles are what BonJovi can bring out in a way that says Yes, that's me, how'd they know i needed that song to get me through this muck.  <br />There are lots of great Rock albums but there are few that out-distance the range of versatility and depth that \\"Keep the Faith\\" keeps presenting throughout every song.  If you've ever come across an album that has a mysterious healing balm for the soul, this one you will notice also resurges your mind, body and spirit.  Give it a Shot, and it will give you the boost you needed.

B000KJTKDE|4.0|Born out of the tail end of the British punk scene, this debut album by the Police is a severely underrated offering. Sting gives us a hint of his great lyric-writing abilities so evident on future albums on tracks like \\"Roxanne\\" and \\"Born in the 50's\\". It becomes very clear as one listens to the tracks here that this is not your usual run-of-the-mill punk band with lame, brain-dead lyrics and 3-chord 4/4 time music but the great musicianship of Summers, Copeland and Sumner and the complex stylings and arrangements of the compositions come to the fore on \\"Hole In My Life\\" and \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\" This mini lp replica sleeve version is a real treat too as the sound quality is very well remastered and sounds excellent and contains all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. Recommended.

B000286RKW|5.0|In the 1970's director Francis Ford Coppola treated audiences with possibly the most accurate, yet somewhat romanticized, depiction of life in the mafia with his brilliant films \\"The Godfather\\" and \\"The Godfather 2\\". Ever since those two movies, no other movie has come close to touching the quality that is displayed in these two films for this genre, some have tried and come close (\\"The Godfather 3\\" being chief among them), but none have succeeded. That is until director Martin Scorsese released his biopic on the life of mobster Henry Hill with \\"Goodfellas\\". <br /> <br />\\"Goodfellas\\" follows the life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a small-time hood who happens to participate in a robbery with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro), calm and calculating individual, and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), a psycho with an incredibly short fuse. Little did Henry know that this robbery would place him on the path to becoming a 'made man' in the very mafia family that Jimmy Conway eventually becomes head of. As Henry Hill rises through the ranks of 'La Cosa Nostra' he manages to find some peace and stability when he meets a young Italian woman (Lorraine Braco) that he marries and has a few kids with. However, the excesses of mafia life eventually begin to get the better of Henry, as he begins to unravel due to heavy drug use, and making matters worse his one-time friend and Don, Jimmy Conway believes Henry may be a threat to him and plots to 'whack' him. With his life in possible jeopardy, Henry has two choices, one stay true to the family and face possible execution, or two, become a government informant and be placed into Witness Protection, becoming a rat in the eyes of the 'family'. <br /> <br />Director Martin Scorsese's work here is by far some of his best. His gritty, realistic approach to this true story, really shows the audience the great wealth and success (if you can call it that) that mafia life can have, while at the same time showing the pitfalls that can occur in that same life. The cast that Scorsese has managed to bring together for this film is truly excellent, and the performances by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta are so powerful, and at times scary, that you can really appreciate the great talent that these actors possess. The supporting cast is equally talented, and just as worthy of praise as the three leads. An interesting note is that for his role of the psychotic Tommy DeVito, Joe Pesci improvised some of the more extreme moments the character has, earning him great critical praise and somewhat typecasting him in this type of role. The story is an excellent cautionary tale on what can happen when your choices lead you on the wrong path, even though it's the only path you ever dreamed of. The movie is probably just as strong as \\"The Godfather\\", maybe even stronger due to it's even greater authenticity and lack of romanticizing life in the mafia. For those moviegoers that enjoy mafia themed movies, but have never seen this gangster classic, you must do yourself a huge favor and watch this movie, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />\\"Goodfellas\\" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality/brief nudity.

B00008RWRH|4.0|There's no getting around the fact that Jochum adds his own personal touches to all the works in this set, and as with his Bruckner, they work marvelously and make the listening a lot of fun. Haydn infuses his work with a great deal of humor and wit as it is; these performances simply enhance those qualities. They're not as rough & ready as Bernstein/NYP, not as refined as Colin Davis/COA; but they're well-played, inspired, and for the Haydn enthusiast, never dull.  <br /> <br />The \\"bonus\\" recordings on Disc #5 date from 1962 and 1958 (the remainder of the set from 1972-73) and sound absolutely great!

B000NA2BEU|5.0|Today the CW officially cancelled the best show on television (understandably, some would say, due to abysmally low ratings). There lingers a chance that the series might be revitalized in a different form, but the hammer has officially fallen. Veronica Mars is unceremoniously over.<br /><br />Season 3 was the first (and last) season of the show to air on the fledgling CW network. It took a different approach to storytelling than seasons 1 and 2, featuring two separate mystery arcs and a number of one-episode mysteries, rather the season-long affairs for which the show had become known and loved. Despite the change, season 3 works as excellent, intriguing television. The writing is witty and the acting in sharp, as before.<br /><br />The creator of the show, Rob Thomas, once heard the series described as \\"Chinatown meets Heathers.\\" That's a perfect description. I would say it also owes heavily to Twin Peaks. Chinatown happens to be my all-time favorite movie. I'm a noir junky, and V-Mars serves it up in lusty, lipsticked, smoke-tinted glory with every episode. Many people are turned off by the concept of a high school/college girl solving mysteries. And they should be. As a premise, this show would easily fail in the hands of most producers. But Thomas and co-writers have created something magical and perfect here. The heroine Veronica is sarcastic, at times mean, overly hard-boiled, and full of acerbic wit. There's nothing candy-coated about Veronica. First time viewers often disregard the show as \\"another teen drama,\\" and for this reason more than any other it failed to attract a sustaining audience. I urge you to give it a chance. Especially if you have a sarcastic mind, if you've lost faith in the basically good nature of humanity, if noir interests you, or if you just like an intelligent mystery or exceptionally well-acted drama, this may be what you're looking for. It was for me.<br /><br />Admittedly, I watch very little television, but to put things in perspective this is a short list of the TV shows I've watched and loved over the years: Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, Freaks and Geeks, Deadwood, and Wonderfalls.  I would place Veronica Mars at the top of this delightful heap. (Actually, looking at that list, every show was cancelled before its time save BSG which is still on the air. Maybe that says something. Maybe not.) Recently, my wife and I started re-watching season 1 and 2 of Veronica Mars with a friend.  His comment after one episode was this, \\"This show shouldn't be on television. It's too... challenging, too beautiful.\\" I couldn't have said it any better. Unfortunately, our friend was right in the end. V-Mars was too challenging, too beautiful.  And now it's gone.n perspective this is a short list of the TV shows I've watched and loved over the years: Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, Freaks and Geeks, Deadwood, and Wonderfalls.

B000NVIGC0|4.0|Since the release of Wilco's sixth studio release, there has been a lot of comotion as to the quality of the album.  Before one decides this, however, he must understand that this isn't the Wilco you've heard before.  Fans expecting the Alternative Country music of A.M. and Being There will be disappointed, as will the indie's who are expecting another Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  Wilco has moved on to what, i guess, could be considered Americana (but that word is a pretty broad genre).  So what kind of music is this CD?  Ehhhh, the best I can describe it as is being Sky Blue Sky type music.  Honestly, it sounds exactly how an openminded listener would expect it to.  Tweedy claimed this CD to be about ambiguity and, more importantly, the acceptance of that ambiguity.<br /><br />Once you realize this, its really up to you if you like the CD.  I love it.  It is the perfect \\"beautiful sunny day\\" type music.  Listening to this CD very literally makes me more optimistic about life, which is nice as most of the quality music out there can tend to be on the depressing side.  I'm giving it 4 stars.  But that's personal opinion.  Honestly, I can't see even the largest of haters giving it less than 2 stars.  Those who did bought the CD expecting country or indie and this is neither.<br /><br />So if I were you, a customer wondering if (s)he should get this CD, I would litsen to the clips on Amazon.  They represent the CD very well.  It is a lot more instrumental than their more recent CDs have been.  If I HAD to make a comparison, I would say its most like Summerteeth with the mellowness of Ghost is Born.  This is not Wilco \\"going back to its roots\\" and this is not Wilco \\"sticking with what worked in YHF\\". They've moved on.
B000MV8ZD6|3.0|This is the third in a loose trilogy of films by Italian master of the macabre Lucio Fulci set in New England that evoke the uncanny and cosmic terrors of H.P. Lovecraft. The other two films \\"City of the Living Dead\\" and \\"The Beyond\\" are quite a bit better than \\"House by the Cemetery\\", but that doesn't mean this film is totally without merit. At times Fulci succeeds very well in creating an atmosphere of dread and fear, and the film is not without some subtle moments of terror, due mainly to an eerie soundtrack and a couple of creepy kids. But fans of Fulci and Italian horror cinema in general are not interested in the type of subtle scares one might find in English ghost stories; instead his films are marked by unusual levels of graphic violence. Although this film is not without its moments (throats ripped out, maggot ridden bodies and decapitation), the violence seems quite muted compared to other Fulci films. Fulci is perhaps aiming too strongly for the atmosphere of Lovecraft, and subsequently forgets to invest in his film the graphic and absurdly violent scenes which have afforded his work a cult following. The film as is usually the case with Fulci makes little sense and is full of continuity errors, its difficult to know whether this is down to bad editing, or an intentional effort to create an uncanny world in which time and space are confused, personally I prefer the latter possibility. There has always been something dream like and hallucinatory about Italian horror cinema and this film doesn't disappoint on that level. By combing Freud and Frankenstein in the name of the films ostensible monster/zombie, the rotting cadaver of the once great scientist Dr. Freudstein provides an interesting connection between psychoanalysis and the scientist playing god. In light of Fulci's career post \\"House by the Cemetery\\", this has to be considered one of his last decent efforts.<br /><br />This DVD re-issue is by Blue Underground, who seem to have acquired some of the titles of Anchor Bay's back catalogue for re-issue. My only main grumble is with the audio, which is particularly tinny, other than that this is a good reasonably priced package.the titles of Anchor Bay's back catalogue for re-issue.

B000OCXMAE|1.0|I'm WAY older than the average LP fan, but I've always been impressed by the alchemy of LP:  the short punchy songwriting, the dual vocal attack (the rapping contrasted well with the impassioned screaming :), the heavy walls of catchy Nu Metal guitar (a refreshing absense of noodly solos - I like guitar solos but their absense from LP made room for other things), the interesting and innovative scratching and effects from Mr. Hahn.  There is literally not a weak moment on their first two albums.  The whole was greater than the sum of the parts, and really made for great repeated listening. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, they've tried to \\"grow up\\" on this album.  Bad, bad, bad idea.  They've abandoned everything that made them GOOD, and made an album of BLAND and GENERIC ballads (ballads for god's sake!)... this could have been any of a thousand other forgettable bands that you hear on the radio and instantly ignore.  I literally do not understand how this album could be receiving any positive reviews at all... the people who think this is good either a) have never heard rock music before, so it all sounds new and wonderful  or b) are such passionate fans that this could have been an album of LP christmas carols and they would have liked it. <br /> <br />For the rest of us, don't bother.  The world is full of good music (the first two LP albums among them).  Don't waste your time with this.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I'm basically a moderate Linkin Park fan. I own both Hybrid Theory and Meteora, but found both CD's to be pretty forgettable overall. They definitely had their share of great tracks, but both CD's felt a little too \\"empty\\" to me. The music was all very cold and technological and really lacked any soul, in my opinion.  <br /> <br />Meteora sounded pretty much the same as Hybrid Theory, featuring almost no growth for the band. When I first heard the first single off Minutes to Midnight, (What I've Done,) I was a little worried that this would yet again sound too similar to Hybrid Theory.  <br /> <br />The good news is that this CD actually turned out to be a huge change for the band. There's still the electronic sounds, there's still the rap, there's still the mosh-friendly songs, but it's all a bit more subdued, giving the songs here much more weight, sincerity, and emotion.  <br /> <br />Yeah, it sounds a bit weird to be saying this about a mainstream rock band, but this CD really features some strong lyrics, some very strong and catchy songs, as well as some great actual music. Yes, the CD is a bit slower than their first 2, but that's okay. This is still Linkin Park, and it still keeps the same old Linkin Park sound. It's just much more subdued and matured.  <br /> <br />A lot of reviewers have complained about several balads on the CD. Yes, there are several. But the ENTIRE CD is not made up of them. There are still lots of mosh pit songs like \\"Given Up\\" (which probably features the most drawn out screem I think I've ever heard from Chester), \\"Bleed It Out\\" (a very fast song featuring a great rap/rock combo,) \\"What I've Done\\" (classic Linkin Park) and \\"No More Sorrow.\\" (An AFI-sounding song that I really didn't end up liking as much as the others on this CD).  <br /> <br />But as people have pointed out, yes, the majority of the CD is a bit different. It's true that songs like \\"In Between\\" (where Mike Shinoda actually sings, and pretty well,)and \\"Shadow of the Day\\" are maybe a little too slow. But they're the exception. Most of the slow songs, like \\"Valentines Day\\" and \\"In Pieces\\" start out slow, but lead up to a really strong and fast ending. <br /> <br />Then the song \\"Hands Held High\\" remaines slow throughout but is a very powerful song musically and ends up being a high point on the CD.  <br /> <br />The best songs on the CD are when they blend the slow and the fast, like on \\"Valentines Day\\" \\"Leave Out All the Rest\\" (Hopefully their 2nd single)and \\"The Little Things Give You Away.\\" These songs represent where the band should be heading; in a direction that mixes the fast with the slow. I think that's how to please the fans who seem so divided over this CD. The amount of variety on this CD is pretty impressive, with no songs sounding the same. Many are done with different styles and different speeds. <br /> <br />If you listen to this with an open mind (not with hopes that it'll sound like Linkin Park's past CD's...because it doesn't,) and you'll probably enjoy it. It's a really excellent CD and while there are a couple songs that seem a bit too slow, they are vastly outnumbered. Yes, overall this CD's a bit slower and more melody-based, (and less Nu-Metal) but if fans give it a chance, they'll really like it. This is the maturation of a great band and I can't wait to see where they head in the future.
1400063515|3.0|Taleb has some fascinating thoughts on risk and predictions. Had there been an editor brave enough to delete the meandering anecdotes, attacks on every expert named (excpet Mandlebrot and, curiously, Malcolm Gladwell), the relentless self-aggrandizement, and barely concealed rage at those more famous than he, one might find two good chapters in here. Really, really good chapters. As it stands, your best bet is to skim, and not to look for the final summation chapter showing you how to apply this insight. Because it's not there.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|The problem is this isn't a bad record, but for Linkin Park I expected more. They are slow putting out albums so we should get more. The second album was just as good as the first, if not better. This album is definately not up to par with the first two albums. The sound is so different, not to say it's bad. However, LP gave up rap metal which was a big mistake because that was their specialty. This album is too different and it's like their copying U2 on many tracks. They should have kept the rapping, etc. Where is Mr. Hahn on this record? Is he really still part of the band? They should have stuck to what they know. This record would be great for anybody else, but not LP. I'm very disappointed they didn't change their sound, but without abandoning the rapping and Mr. Hahn's talents. Thats what made this band so special afterall.

B000OCXMAE|1.0|Unless these guys start working on making a real album immediately they are finished. Maybe its just the way it is huh? nothing lasts forever and all that crap; but its so hard to accept when it comes to LP, Damm!, they where so freaking good... I am so dissapointed. Couldnt they gave us just one more awsome album before they turned gay? It could have been the perfect trilogy! <br />  I mean the title \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" was awsome: it helped build expectation among fans.  <br />  The reputation was solid: Meteora was just as good (if not better) as Hybrid Theory. <br />  The time was due: 4 long years since their last CD! everybody was just craving it! <br />  Yes people, the stage was set, the tickets sold out, the crowd was silent, the clock was ticking, just minutes to midnight... everybody was just waiting for LP to rip through the earth with their God-given sound.  <br />  But they freaking went soft!!! When toughing up just a little was the obvious way to go. Where did \\"The Linkin Park\\" go? Whata hell happened to them?! aaarrgghh! Where is their mind-blowing-heart-pounding sound now? Where is that perfect mix of rap and rock that made them who they are? I guess 4 years is just too long of a time, because they completely forgot how to make music.  <br />  The missed their chance to give the world the greatest moment of all times in the history of Rock. Elvis and The beatles would have been forgotten in a split second.  <br />  That would have been the gratest gift to all their fans and followers, we deserved it. <br />  I woulnt have cared if the rest of the music they made after that was all crap, because that moment would have made it alright.(Doesnt mean that I would buy their crap though.) <br />  And for all those sissies defending them: Linkin Park has made only 2 albums.  <br />     <br /> <br />

In one category are the albums that excited me almost immediately and sucked me in from almost the first note--those would be [[ASIN:B000001IPS Punk in Drublic]]and [[ASIN:B00004TCPF Pump Up the Valuum]].<br /><br />In the second category are the albums that didn't jump out to me at first--in fact, maybe I even disliked at first--but in time grew on me and got better and better with each listen.  In this category, [[ASIN:B000001IRB Heavy Petting Zoo]] and [[ASIN:B000001IOS White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean]].<br /><br />So I like this disc, and I would put it in category 2.  I was a little put-off at first from the CD-ROM intro and opening to the liner notes, because I thought NOFX was a smartly political band--smart in the sense that they mostly attacked mediocrity and small-mindedness in everyday life, which reflected on the big picture, but was basically trying to change the people in the crowd rather throw garbage than the big heads on stage.  They can be as mad as they want about the first W. Bush election, but I was afraid that they had fallen into the trap of bad, hackneyed political rage.<br /><br />I was a teen in the Reagan era, and when George W. got elected, an old friend of mine said a very wise thing: \\"Man, this sucks,\\" he said, \\"but at least we'll get some good music out of it.\\"  Probably the best thing I could say as a personal boon from the Reagan years was all the great, angry music that came out during it.  Of course, there was a lot of crap (take child punk band Old Skull ([[ASIN:B000008J3H Get Outta School]]) and their insightful commentary, \\"I hate you, Ronald Reagan!\\"), but I can wade through a lot of crap if it lets me light on an island called [[ASIN:B000008EOX The Age of Quarrel]] or Suicidal Tendencies (s/t, of course).  So I had hope for some cool music as the age of George W. began, and as much as I like to disparage Green Day, I found \\"Holiday\\" to be one of the best durn songs they've ever done.<br /><br />But my first listen to this NOFX disc made me think that they'd fallen into the Pile of Crap category of angry political punk commentary.  \\"The Irrationality of Rationality\\" is still one of the weaker tracks on this disc in my estimation, but luckily NOFX still take stabs at what they stab best--lame punk rock (\\"Medio-core\\") and sexual prissiness (\\"She's Nubs\\").  Later on, with \\"American Errorist,\\" they abdicate more of taking a stand rather than a particular ideology, though I'm sure some dualist will have a disagreement with that assessment.<br /><br />In all, this isn't one of NOFX's best efforts, but don't let the overt political messages distract you--there is still a lot of good, refreshingly funny NOFX in \\"We Got Two Jealous Agains\\" and \\"Whoops, I OD'd.\\"  They remain nicely contrary and rigidly independent from trends, whether those trends be in music or popular thought.  I mean, YEARS after their musical proclamation that they won't play ska anymore, here comes \\"Anarchy Camp.\\"  The overt contradiction is nothing less than a good chuckle against the rigid, unimaginative realm of those who think there is such a thing as consistency in life.<br /><br />To the boys of NOFX, I raise a Walker Blue to your continued health.  Keep churning it out.my first listen to this NOFX disc made me think that they'd fallen into the Pile of Crap category of angry political punk commentary.  \\"The Irrationality of Rationality\\" is still one of the weaker tracks on this disc in my estimation, but luckily NOFX still take stabs at what they stab best--lame punk rock (\\"Medio-core\\") and sexual prissiness (\\"She's Nubs\\").

B000NA1OXY|4.0|Avril Lavigne is back and better than ever with her third album, The Best Damn Thing. The album explores Avril's spunky, punk-rock side with a few ballads here and there. The first track is her current single \\"Girlfriend\\", a perfect spring/summer song to rock out to. The lyrics are fun and the production is A+. Then, you get another gem...yet again, a punk-like track, \\"I Can Do Better\\". This track is instantly catchy and is insanely fun to listen to. The next two tracks, \\"Runaway\\" and \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" are good, but forgettable. Or maybe they are just growers...? <br /> <br />\\"When You're Gone\\" is next. This is the ballad from the album that everyone is talking about. The amazing instrumentation adds to Avril's great vocal performance. While the track is good, I prefer \\"Innocence\\" instead. \\"Everything Back But You\\" is slightly catchy, but on first listen, I didn't like it. It has grown on me and I like it more now. It is a hard punk-rocker that will get you out of your seat instantly. \\"Hot\\" comes next. It is a pop/rock track that, while still good, isn't as good as I thought it would be when I heard the clip of it. \\"Innocence\\", one of my favorite tracks on the album, is the superior ballad over \\"When You're Gone\\". It is like an improved version of it. The piano melodies are great and Avril's voice is in tip-top shape in this song, and it definitely stands out. \\"I Don't Have To Try\\" is easily a stand out. The beginning is incredibly fun and spunky, and then it goes into a great pop/rock track, reminiscent of an early Ashlee Simpson track. Which, I love Ashlee. <br /> <br />The last three tracks are kind of 'blah' to me, but aren't bad. \\"One Of Those Girls\\" is forgettable. \\"Contagious\\" is good, but it needs to be longer (it is barely over 2 minutes long). \\"Keep Holding On\\" closes the album, and it is certainly a good song, but is a huge grower and takes some getting used to. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is good and I highly recommend it. Be sure to pick up your copy today!!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|<br />This was my favorite Bond film yet.  It was thrilling yet believable in the action scenes.  Daniel Craig pushes through with brute force and a grit that many past Bonds have lacked.  He can also play the debonair and smitten with equal verisimilitude.   <br />The script was well written with good dialogue.  Being a Bond movie, of course the bad guy has his distinctive idiosyncrasy, and there is the requisite femme fatale, but how could it not? <br />All in all, this movie was a fun flick for times when you want some light entertainment watching gorgeous people and in exotic places crushing the bad guys with fists and intellect. <br />
B000J103PC|2.0|I was more than a little disappointed by this film.  Perhaps my expectations had been unrealistically raised.  Perhaps the film was just not that good.  In fact, it was probably a bit of both.<br /><br />I suspect the New York fashion industry has its fair share of piranhas swimming about in the pond.  Yet, having said this, \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" was simply an attempt to use caricature as a vehicle for comedy.  This works for a while but, at some point, it begins to wear a bit thin.<br /><br />Can I recommend this film to the reader?  Alas, no.  Save your time and money for something else.
075640407X|5.0|If you are a fan of Orson Scott Card's books or the Codex Alera from Jim Butcher, you'll love this book.  It's as if the author took ideas from these other books and combined them all into a unique, entertaining story.<br /><br />Now that I think of it, it also reminded me a bit of the Dark Tower series from Stephen King.<br /><br />I won't bore you with details of the story, just know that the first 30 pages or so are NOT an idication of the rest of the book.  Once Kvothe starts telling his story, things get interesting quickly.
0553801503|1.0|I am a huge GEorge Martin fan, and feel really ripped off and abused by this book.  It is truly awful - not only dull, but positively unpleasant.<br /><br />I started to wonder if he was having a miserable divorce while writing it, because he seems suddenly to have it in for women.  So many of the women characters in this book are the same: scheming, mean, controlling, lewd b------.  It's the same idea, over and over.<br /><br /> He's awful in what he has happen to the two positive female characters in the book.  Everything is negative and horrid in this story.  There is no one to root for, not even a couple of characters who were very appealing in the otehr books.  HEre they are creepy or pathetic.<br /><br />He actually admits in the preface that he had trouble with the book, wrote it far too long and so cut it in half, with all the good characters left out of this one!!!!!  It's worse than that - he didn't put much plot in it either.<br /><br />Reading this book was getting to share a terrible writer's block with no plot, no good ideas, nastiness towards his own characters.  Martin should have put it all in the garbage, taken a break, and started over.  As it was, my copy ended up in the garbage.  I actually stopped about thirty pages short of the end, which tells you what a dull, nasty plot it had.
B000N6TX1I|2.0|If a movie could be a pointless short story this would be it.  <br /> <br />As the movie got going and established its setting and storyline, it ended. I couldn't help but ask... \\"so what?\\" At the end.  <br /> <br />I think the storyline had huge potential and I think the setting was great! The setting is the only reason I can give this movie two stars. The director sufficiently convinced me of the hopelessness of mankind in that situation. Its too bad that he could not accomplish more with the potential he had.  <br /> <br />There has been a lot of stock put into the depth of this movie. I have to say that other than the depravity of man there is nothing the movie has to say on any subject. I think other movies more skillfully paint that picture, such as Blood Diamond.  <br /> <br />I guess this movie is worth renting but I do not reccommend purchasing it.
6305897786|3.0|I liked \\"The Ninth Gate\\" for its incredibly long credit sequence at the beginning of the film.  The music is dramatic as it sweeps through door after door after door, all of which look exactly the same.  After about the fourth door, it becomes silly and laughter sets in.  It's like listening to an old vinyl record that is skipping, but not getting up to move the needle.<br /><br />After this, the movie goes downhill a bit, but Roman Polanski puts on a good show.  Particularly interesting is the consummation sequence in which his real-life wife Emmanuelle Seigner plays the green-eyed girl & does the deed with Depp to a background of flames.  It's not many men who would want their wives to do that, but Polanski's viewpoint has always been unique.  He is a great filmmaker.  His Best Director Oscar for \\"The Pianist,\\" nominations for \\"Chinatown\\" & \\"Tess\\" plus his screenplay nomination for the legendary \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" prove the point.  Even if 9th Gate begins to get a bit muddled, he has more than fulfilled his promise since his first film \\"Knife in Water\\" got a Best Foreign Language Film nomination back in 1963.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is also usually very interesting to watch.  He scored a couple Best Actor nominations for very different roles from \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\\" in 2003 to \\"Finding Neverland\\" in 2004.  As book dealer Dean Corso, I found the character's moral ambiguity to make him unattractive.  You couldn't really cheer for him; but he was interesting as he worked his way through the maze of facts in this old book mystery.<br /><br />Frank Langella has had a long career from \\"Diary of a Mad Housewife\\" back in 1970 to \\"Good Night & Good Luck\\" in 2005.  As the rich book collector Boris Balkan, he was very cerebral, but lacked a certain evil pizzazz to really make you cheer as he bursts into flames.  It felt more like he was pathetically weird.  Maybe that was what Polanski wanted.<br /><br />Lena Olin is such an interesting actress to watch.  She makes you feel like at any moment she could do almost anything.  She would work again with Depp in \\"Chocolat\\" and had a sole Oscar nomination in the supporting category in 1989 for \\"Enemies: A Love Story.\\"  The role of Liana Telfer maximizes her strengths.  She goes from making love to Depp to trying to kill him with a hair-trigger temper.  Tony Amoni as her bodyguard with the cropped blond hair makes a visual impression.<br /><br />British stage actress Barbara Jeffords who appeared in films sporadically from \\"Hamlet\\" in 1959 to \\"Madame Bovary\\" in 2000, makes a memorable appearance as Baroness Kessler, another book collector.  The last sequence with her wheelchair banging repetitively into the wall as Corso awakes to find the flat aflame is visually brilliant.  James Russo who played Sheriff Poole in one of my favorite films, \\"Open Range,\\" puts in a good appearance as Bernie the bookseller who doesn't last too long holding onto Corso's rare tome.<br /><br />\\"The Ninth Gate\\" isn't the most dreadful film ever.  Polanski is far too good a director for that to occur.  But it bogs down in plot details that never really seem to fit together.  For instance, how did all the pictures in the books once the three editions came together actually enable Boris Balkan?  Or they didn't, which is why he burned up -- and if that's the case, then was the film really all about something that didn't exist?  Yet, we see the Green Eyed girl flitting about; so we must conclude that something was going on, but what?  Did Depp's Corso become like Mia Farrow in \\"Rosemary's Baby\\"?  Who knows?  After a movie as long as this, it should have been clear.  Perhaps we should just go to \\"Pirates 3\\" and not worry about it.  Next!resting actress to watch.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is the sleeper movie of the decade and easily the best dark comedy I have seen... period.  <br /> <br />First of we all know this is a spoof and is supposed to be funny. And it really is! But who knew there was going to be some serious depth to it.  <br /> <br />The script had tons of foreshadowing. When you watch this movie the second time you start cracking up at the characters you see before they are zombies and the part they played. I have not seen such funny and creative foreshadowing in a movie ... period.  <br /> <br />The romantic conflict was well done. Questions are raised about what a relationship is supposed to be like and the role others play in a relationship. It even had a great fight scene that I have to say resembles more than a few I have had in my lifetime. <br /> <br />The inner conflict as the main character becomes acutely aware of his life wasting away was almost inspiring... in a funny lazy sort of way. <br /> <br />The zombies were suitably creepy and had bits of fright amongst the laughs.  <br /> <br />You care about the characters because of all the internal and relationship conflict and the roles are very well acted out. Amazingly well, acted out.  <br /> <br />I have to give warning due to the language and gore but if you can hack it, get this movie you will not be dissapointed.
0385340559|5.0|I started reading Bad Luck and Trouble the second I tore into the packaging - in one day I had read 300 pages. Bad Luck and Trouble is, like other Reacher novels, a joy to read, even when the subject matter is serious. Child has made Jack Reacher a complete character that you look up to - a big man, tough, independent, with his own sense of justice.<br /><br />After 9/11, Reacher had to get on the grid because of national security - he now has a passport and an ATM card. When checking his meager funds, he notices a big deposit - the numbers in the amount correspond to a military code for emergency contact. He finds that a member of his old special investigation unit has been murdered. He and the remaining members of his unit reunite to solve the murder. Top secret military weapon components are missing, and are at the center of this investigation.<br /><br />It is interesting to see Reacher interact with friends. You see another side of him - still tough, dangerous, but one sees the love and loyalty with folks that watch each others backs and form one unit - whether in the military, or in civilian life. Interesting to read Reacher's reactions to the other members' post military careers and successes.<br /><br />The action is nonstop, and as usual, Reacher (and company) make their own kind of justice to revenge the deaths of the lost members of their unit.<br /><br />Child has written a taut, exciting book that makes us like Reacher even more than before (if that's possible).<br /><br />Reacher is a loner, but he takes care of his own. And that's why he's such a marvelous character.<br /><br />A great read.

B000IOM0WY|3.0|I agree with one of the other reviewers here.  The picture is quite grainy on a Full HD 1080P screen. 19.95 is a great price if you don't have it yet but I think the DVD looks a bit better even on a HD telly because you don't get the digital noise.  Also only has Dolby Digital soundtrack so not much to be gained in terms of sound either.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|when i first heard them on their first CD, i couldn't stop listening to them, but with this Album, it doesn't give me that same feeling. I still enjoy the two previous albums more than this one!  <br /> <br />Cons:  <br />* where's the rapping? b/c LP suppose to be a combination of Rap and Rock  <br />now it's just Rock,  <br />* WHERE IS MR.HAN in THIS??? i loveee the scratching of the turntables!!! (very minimum) <br />* does not get me pump up, and i LP sounds use to get all pump up <br /> <br />I wouldn't say it's a waste to get the CD, but if u are expecting the same feeling when u listened to Linkin Park, it's not...  <br /> <br />well that's my 2 cents =P
B00008LOS1|5.0|The original tracks to Who's Next sound bigger and clearer than ever. Thanks to Glyn Johns production and engineer Jon Astley, Keith Moon's drumming is finally heard in all of it's fire and glory. The bonus tracks are kind of a history lesson of the Life House project. You get the idea on how hard they worked before scrapping Lif House and salvaging the strongest songs. My only peeve with this edition is that they don't include the final mix of \\"Pure and Easy\\". That being said, these CDs never leave my CD player. The live show is interesting. The band hasn't quite got \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" into their DNA yet, so it's a bit scattered. But still, it's the Who in their early 70s prime and they really rock.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|Do you want to laugh, be scared or grossed out?  If your standards are low you might find something to enjoy about Hostel.  Then again, maybe not.  All the humor is of the unintentional variety.  One character explains his friend's apparent sudden departure simply by saying: \\"We're not in America dude... that's just how they do things here.\\"  In another scene we see two of the friends silhouettes bumping knuckles in a celebratory fashion while being 'entertained' by a single prostitute.  Such yo-dude frat boy dialog and antics aside, there aren't many moments of this cheesy popcorn flick that qualify as funny and not deplorable.  The fright aspect is non-existent altogether.  The characterizations don't work: neither creating main characters we can (or want to) relate to, nor effectively mocking the stereotype as the director plainly intended... the ignorant Americans making fools of themselves in foreign countries.  The best I can say is that blood and gore are quite plentiful and there is plenty of teenage-fantasy style nudity (mostly topless women) and sex (latently homoerotic?), but there is still nothing novel or unique to any of it.  Director Eli Roth doesn't seem to have the intellectual depth required to succeed at either horror or satire.  How such poorly conceived movie ideas get awarded with huge budgets I'll never know.  All in all, this movie is purely for adolescents with bad taste.
B000000WF0|5.0|What a shame that The Verve was just a one hit wonder. This is a great cd, and while all the other songs are slightly over shadowed by Bittersweet Symphony, all of the songs are really good. This band should have had a much longer halflife then they did, but when you make a song as perfect as Bittersweet Symphony, you find it hard to top it. You all know you have downloaded that song (some illegaly), so for this great price, just go ahead and buy the album. Once you listen to the cd you won't be disapointed.
0440237688|5.0|Jonas, the main character of The Giver, is a 12 year old boy living in a society that has decided to rid itself of imperfections. The weather, for example, has been erased, leaving every day a bland day without sun, rain, wind or snow. Color has been erased. Animals no longer exist. Perfectly proper language must be used at all times - if a child mistakenly says just before lunch, \\"I'm starving,\\" that is cause to be beaten, because, although he may be hungry, he is not actually \\"starving.\\" Love has been erased, presumably because it is often messy or painful. And choice has been erased. A committee of elders from this society decides, when you are twelve, what occupation you will begin training for, and eventually they decide to whom you will be married and if you are fit to raise children. You do not HAVE children in this society, however. One of the occupations for females who are slightly less intelligent and hard working is 'birth mother.' Birth mothers live amongst themselves, and give birth to up to three children who are in turn given to suitable parents. (There is no mention of how these children are fathered - the only loose end in the story but one my middle school language arts students found unsatisfactory.) There is, then, no need for sex nor sexual desire; when that little problem comes up among adolescents, they are told by their parents that they must start taking a pill daily that erases these urges.<br /><br />The novel begins just before the main character, Jonas, turns twelve. At the Ceremony of Twelves he learns that he has been chosen to be the next Receiver of Memory, a position of prestige but one that is very painful, for Jonas learns that every other person in his town, with the exception of The Giver, has had their memories of the past erased. He must be given these memories - memories of love, of extended family, of war, of pain, of snow, of animals, of everything that has been erased - and he discovers the richness of the world that has been extinguished, its good and bad, the absurdities, joys, tragedies, everything that makes us at times sad but also, at times, euphoric. Jonas realizes how colorless, literally and figuratively, this new world he lives in really is, and he is overwhelmed with the knowledge. The reader is treated to a captivating story, one that is difficult to put down. When I read it along with my students, as a group, out loud, and I say, \\"OK, now we'll stop and read again tomorrow,\\" there will be a collective protest because they do not want to wait until tomorrow; every chapter they read must be followed immediately by the next. This incredibly well written novel is at times almost unbearably sad, though, and if sharing it with students or your own children, it is best to read it first so that you can ascertain if it is age-appropriate. When it is age-appropriate, is is one of the best novels to share with young people, a story that they will remember long after they have finished it.as been extinguished, its good and bad, the absurdities, joys, tragedies, everything that makes us at times sad but also, at times, euphoric.

B000IFQLSW|5.0|I found this CD/DVD very interesting. It's great that some of these great talented folks can be brought to the lime light by someone so young. These bluemen and many others that have passed on are the fondation for todays music.<br /><br />Henry Townsend is a personal favorite of mine and I was happy that he was included in this project. Sorry to say that Henry to has passed. I only wish that they filmed & recorded Henry before he begain to decline.<br /><br />I have personly seen some of these guy perform over the years. It is just great that more people (hopefuuly) will be exposed to ther music.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|In recent years, about the past seven, there's been a Thrash metal revival of sorts. The most interesting thing about this revival is the lesser tier thrash bands (i.e. Exodus, Kreator, Destruction, Hirax, etc.) have made WAY better albums than \\"the big four\\" (i.e. Slayer, Megadeth, Metallica, Anthrax). Part of the reason for the less popular bands making better albums is because they aren't tied down by trends the same way the \\"big four\\" are. \\"Christ Illusion\\" had three decent songs and was otherwise a joke. Another album that Slayer fans will drool over. That Anthrax album of four years ago was okay, but then again forgetable. It didn't stand out. Metallica...well, I always hated them. But maybe with \\"United Abominations\\" we have the exception to the aforementioned rule. Megadeth has a huge fan base and with a fan club that big it is hard to please everyone from the old school to the new school to the people that want the band to grow musically. I count myself in the \\"old school\\" category. <br /> <br />At this point, it's only MegaDave. But that's the way it's always been so why should we want things to change? Even though this is a one man band (kinda like Chuck Schuldiner's Death), there have been worse products from one-man-groups. The best thing about this album is the riffs. Catchy, greatly executed, and challenging with some technical flare. Dave's voice sounds a little better and the production isn't overdone like it was on \\"The System Has Failed\\".  <br /> <br />The songs have breadth and don't all sound the same. The consistency of song writing is pretty even throughout. Dave must have worked overtime on the guitar work because all the guitar parts fit so well together. The lyrics and the political subject matter are amusing at best -never to be considered a \\"serious\\" political statement. You can respect that Dave speaks from the heart, but his drug fueled theories about politics are on par with Trey Azagthoth's drug fueled confusing theories about religion. They don't make political or logical sense.  <br /> <br />The only thing holding the band back at this point is the sub-par playing by the Dover twins, mainly the drummer. If it's one thing holding this album back from greatness it is the drumming. It's not good enough. Way too simple for what the songs demand. It seems MegaDave is destined for greatness sometime in the future and the band is almost there, but in the meantime this should quench every Megadeth fan's thirst. Way better than \\"The System Has Failed\\".
B000GPIPT2|4.0|There are many misjudgements about Frankenstein. First, Frankenstein was the creator, not the monster. Second, this film is not a terrifying movie; in fact, in many parts, it is a sad movie.<br /><br />Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein as part of a contest to see who could write the best horror novel. Shelley's won, but it dealt with issues of theology and philosophy more than it did with horror. When the book was to be made into a film, many of those issues remained, and some of the scarier parts of the book were omitted.<br /><br />Thus, we have Frankenstein, a scientist obsessed with creating life from death. He succeeds and creates a towering monster with the brain of an abnormal child. The monster seeks love and nurturing from his creator, but instead he is tormented with the things that frighten him and left to his own devices. On his own, he seeks friendship and understanding, but everywhere he goes, he is misunderstood. Finally, he becomes violent, and the townspeople shun him, forcing him away and taunting him with fire.<br /><br />The film is opened by a warning to the audience reminding us that this is just a story and did not really happen. However, the warning is not necessary, because many of the themes occur in truth, and besides, the movie is not scary.<br /><br />This edition is wonderful. The film print is excellent, and viewers are treated with a short documentary about Boris Karloff, the man who played the monster. Also included are two commentaries and several goodies like fun facts, a photo archive, and a documentary about horror films.
078322947X|4.0|If you love epic movies from the 1970s, 'Sorcerer' is your film. Roy Scheider is at the top of his game, and the cinematography is not only scary as all hell, but it's beautiful at the same time. A slow, concentrated film with a climax that will blow you away.
0143038419|4.0|If you are looking for spiritual guidance, this is not where to look.  This book is a fun and interesting read.  I related to Liz in many parts of the book.  I also enjoyed exploring Italy, India and Indonesia through her experiences.  I love to travel, but it's not practical for me to do as extensively as I'd like.  I found myself laughing out loud throughout the book.  Is it going to help you answer your own life questions?  I think not, but it will remind you that you are the not only searching soul on the planet.  Liz is honest, hilarious and self-deprecating.  She doesn't take herself too seriously, which I love.  This is a story about her personal journey, not a self-help book.  You need to read it accordingly.  Enjoy!!
B00007LTIA|4.0|being this and other works platformed before my present later times . officially through my scope band members from p floyd , g dead , l zepplin , and such others must of made some phone calls to these guys classifying ya took it .
B000NVIGC0|3.0|Surprised. That's the most obvious word that comes to mind. I'm surprised critics and fans like it sooo much.    There are changes in the lyrical attack for sure. I don't dislike them but i much more enjoyed the lyrical acrobatics and vagueness in the vocabulary. Yes, Mr. Tweedy wants to be clearer but i think the vocab suffers a bit. Musically, i like that they recorded the album in such a relaxed manner and the general sound is smooth. That makes it a \\"type\\" of album. The songwriting itself is a little too loose or something. Too many chords and tempo changes and too many solos. I miss some of the pop oriented stuff like the songs \\"I'm the Man Who Loves You\\" and \\"Candyfloss\\". There aren't enough upbeat/fast tempo tunes either. Something rockin' a la \\"I'm A Wheel\\". There's too much Steely Dan and not enough 70's Fleetwood Mac. I don't dislike it and i bought it and i will see 'em when they come to town but...I'm sure it will grow on me. The playing and singing is quality. In a nutshell? The songwriting could be better.    \\"Hummingbird\\" is one of the greatest songs ever. YHF is one of my favorite discs ever.  If you're considering investigating Wilco for the first time start there, not here.
B000I2MRHE|2.0|I bought this playmat for my 8 week old and she hated it. Everytime I put her on it, she would get uncomfortable and cry. I guess it would work better with babies who have already developed enough neck support.
0060730552|3.0|This book is more than just the story of the conquest of a mountain but about survival amidst impossible odds.  I've never climbed a mountain yet I read large quantities of books and accounts about mountaineering.  This was a difficult read for some reason however.  The pages are dense with terminology that make the reading slow and tiresome at times.  I suppose fellow mountaineers can eat this book in an afternoon but although I found the story compelling it took me a while to make any kind of progress and I admit I skimmed pages here and there to find the meat of the story.  Joe Simpson and Simon Yates seem a little foolhardy in some aspects as they attempted a highly difficult climb with very little support knowing in the backs of their minds that anyone injured surely must be left.  The conditions did not seem favorable for a summit in many ways and yet they are full of adventure and ready to get on with it.  I didn't feel especially close to the characters until after the accident as they began to describe the fear, the terror and intimate thoughts and struggles.  I'm glad that I read it, but I have to say that  Jon Krakauer's books are my favorites by far when it comes to the challenge, tragedy and triumph of mountain climbing.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|When I first listened to Minutes to Midnight I literally said to myself, \\"huh - what was that?\\"  Well I kept listening and I am really happy that I did so. Even though it is different, it is a powerful album that will change the way we think about this awesome band. They have turned from the angst of growing up and screaming about themselves, to singing about the world and all of its troubles. Politics aside, the depth of this album will reveal itself each time you listen - so please don't throw it away after the first spin - they deserve a chance to be heard - they are growing up - and so is their music. There is nothing wrong with that!
B000002UAI|5.0|Beatles for Sale by The Beatles is considered their worst album but I truly enjoyed this clever mix of country influenced, blues rocking disc. Mr. Moonlight is not their best cover but the way John Lennon sings and belts this song sure as hell makes up for it. No Reply is my favorite and best track, even the band Garbage stole a line and the hook from this song. Other songs I cannot get enough of are: I'm A Loser, Baby's In Black, Rock and Roll Music, I'll Follow the Sun, Eight Days A Week, and Every Little Thing. Ringo sounds absoutely adorable on the track, Honey Don't. George gets a chance to shine as well on the closing track, Everybody's Trying to be my Baby. I love the way George attacks this song both vocally and performance wise, and Paul continues to grow with his song writing ablities. Beatles for Sale is defintely an album every new Beatles fan should have. Have a ball with this one!
B000MX7V5M|5.0|After reading the gushing, swooning review from the DVD critic in last Tuesday's NY Times, I immediately ordered the \\"Special Collector's Edition\\" of TO CATCH A THIEF from Amazon. When it arrived, I compared it to my original Paramount \\"Widescreen Edition\\" from 2002. Well, the critic was right--there's simply no comparison. This new version has a 2.0 Dolby Surround soundtrack (in addition to the original mono version) and a cleaned-up, enhanced, crystal-clear picture, start to finish. It looks like they took the drab, blurry, faded old stock and actually washed it, removing years of dirt and grime and smoke and hair and whatever else was there, not to mention a computerized removal of virtually all scratches and glitches. The result is astounding.    As for the color, see for yourself. Pay close attention to the first car chase down the mountain, the meeting in the flower market, and the costume ball near the end. Not to mention the many night scenes on rooftops, where everything is now much more visible than before. And Grant and Kelly? Well, the two most beautiful people who ever lived look even more beautiful. Wait till you see the famous fireworks scene now!    I don't have to tell you that this film is wonderful, no matter which version you have. But I can guarantee you that this newly restored version makes it seem better than ever. If you're as nuts about Hitchcock as I am, it really is worth the upgrade. Enjoy!    Update (11/8/2009): The new [[ASIN:B001PKHS68 To Catch a Thief - The Centennial Collection (1955) (2pc)]] is essentially the same as the 2007 \\"Special Collector's Edition,\\" with the same upgraded print. This review applies to both editions.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO LP??? THEY SOUND LIKE SOME KIND OF CHRISTIAN BAND. I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAITED THIS LONG FOR THIS. IT'S LIKE THEY ALL WENT THROUGH SOME EMOTIONAL EVENT AND GOT SOFT. I THINK PREVIOUS FANS WILL HATE THIS.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This cd was a long time coming since Meteora. This band has grown up their lyrics are better the songs are different from the previous two albums they've had out. I really do enjoy this album and the different sounds of it. Some of the good songs on here are of course their for single What I've Done, Leave Out All The Rest, Valentine's Day, and In Pieces. For people who just enjoy the same type of sounds as Linin Park was before they're not going to enjoy it and try classifying it in a total seperate category. At first I wasn't impressed with the song when listening to the album but it grows on you. The lyrics have matured and it shows them and their hard work into putting this album together.<br /><br />Even though some people will more then likely just listen to one of the songs and judge it as bad. In order to actually enjoy this album it takes more then just one listen. To enjoy the album you've got to listen to the album with an open mind and then you'll realize that this album is good and it't not deserving of someo of the negative reviews or responses to people who have commented about the cd. This cd is great and I hope people can realize that just because it's not what you really expected it still can be good.
B0000057C5|5.0|Sehnsucht was the first CD by Rammstein that I got and I have loved them ever since.  In fact, listening to their music is why I speak a fair amount of German right now. <br />The first five tracks, including \\"Engel\\" ('Angel') with wonderful backup vocals by Bobo (an wonder in voice and body), are great.  The sixth, \\"Bück Dich\\" ('Bend Over') is not the hottest track; nor are \\"Eifersucht\\" ('Jealousy') and \\"Spiel mit Mir\\" ('Play with Me'), although they're better.  For a better version of \\"Spiel mit Mir,\\" listen to \\"Live aus Berlin.\\"  \\"Klavier\\" ('Piano') and \\"Alter Mann\\" ('Old Man') are fantastic tracks.  The last listed track, \\"Küss Mich\\" ('Kiss Me') is a great finale.  However, the copy that I got has a bonus track, \\"Stripped,\\" which is a cover of a Depeche Mode song (and much better than the original, if I may say so myself--and I may, because I'm writing this review). <br />While this is not exactly my favorite of all of the Rammstein CDs, it is a fine introduction to a prolific band.
B00005JPFH|5.0|Even when it is really good, as Spider-man 3 is, the 3rd movie in a series almost always gets slammed. By the 3rd film, there are few surprises left, and the initial movie has taken on the glow of nostalgia. So although Spider-man 3 didn't seem to be getting such great reviews, I suspected that it would be better than its reputation. Still, I was surprised by just how good it actually was. <br /> <br />The core of the Spider-man story has always been the soap opera of Peter Parker's life counterbalancing the superheroism. I was worried that with 3 classic Spider-man villains on the bill, the 3rd movie would veer too heavily in the direction of spider-action and shortchange Peter. Thankfully, it did not fall into this trap. There is a strong plot centering around Peter's plans to propose to Mary Jane, her faltering acting career, and the complication of Gwen Stacy. <br /> <br />It was good to see the character of Gwen Stacy in the movie, even though she is a romantic complication rather that Peter's first love the way that she was in the original comic series. Though dramatically strong, the tragic fate of Gwen Stacy in the comics is a bit too heavy for an feel-good action film, so it does not seem unreasonable for the movie to follow more recent retellings of the Spiderman story by keeping the focus on Mary Jane as the primary love interest. <br /> <br />Villain team-ups are of course a staple of Spider-man, but can veer off into overkill. That doesn't happen here. The main antagonists: the Sandman, Venom, and Harry as the son of the Green Goblin are different enough that they complement rather than compete. The film nails the character and look of the Sandman perfectly--a thug, not fundamentally evil, but a guy who always manages to make the worst possible choices. Venom similarly captures the character almost perfectly. The ultimate outcome of Peter's conflict with Harry caught me by surprise (fortunately I'd managed to avoid spoilers). <br /> <br />The one aspectof the film that I found a bit weak, much to my surprise, was the CGI. Somehow, it seemed more difficult to buy the CGI Spiderman as Peter in costume and sometimes the lighting seemed a bit off, but even then, the spider-acrobatics were great. <br /> <br />It seems to be doing well in the box office, so perhaps the franchise will be continuing.
0340839937|5.0|Dune should have been moved from SciFi to Literature long ago. While it does have the makings of an amazing SciFi novel, Dune is also a catalyst for inner change. This book will make you a different person. I've read it 6 times over my life and everytime i pick it up i set it down a little wiser. A must read!
0974869449|5.0|I bought this product to aid me in learning the JLPT level 3 Kanji for my Japanese studies. I don't have to use many words to say that this is a top quality product, the cards are of high quality, clear to read, comprehensive and a great way to learn Japanese.
B000002KKS|5.0|This album is pure genius, and, despite its age (it's now 27 years old!) it hasn't dated at all, which is unusual for a heavy rock album. If the album was released today, it couldn't sound any fresher.<br /><br />The introduction of RJ Dio took 'the worst band in the world' and made them tight, with actually 'catchy' songs that people could listen to, something Osbourne has yet to accomplish.<br /><br />This album would be included in any 'Top 100 Albums of All Time' if it were done by Deep Purple, Queen, or Led Zeppelin. The fact that it's not means that it never will. This is a shame.
0307237699|5.0|There's an older, almost obsolete meaning for the word \\"politic\\" which you'll find in the dictionary: prudent, judicious, practical given the constraints. Senator Obama has written an extremely \\"politic\\" book. For the growing majority of Americans for whom the word \\"political\\" has chiefly negative connotations, Obama's politic meditations on Values, the Constitution, Faith, and Race may seem awkwardly cautious and even obsequious. It truly is time, many feel, to speak with passion, to testify rather than to parley, to turn the rascals out, to cleanse the temple of plutocrats, polluters, and bigots. If you are a reader who feels righteous scorn for the unholy alliance of free-market dogmatists and creationists, I advise you to read Senator Obama's book quietly and thoughtfully. He is certainly a politician, but he is proving himself to be an exceptionally \\"politic\\" one. He seems able to convey respect and cooperativity to folk who haven't practiced or encountered cooperation in recent years. I, for one, finished his book feeling the unaccustomed HOPE that a decent, intelligent human might have a chance to be elected President at long last.
B000I2J79K|2.0|While I thought it was fun to hear some of the old tunes from both of these groups(they perform separately then together at the end), overall musically they were just OK. The two lead singer/guitar player guys were about 25 and stuck out like sore thumbs, playing with these other guys in their 50-60's.  One guy with EW&F jumped around the whole time he was on stage like he couldn't keep still.  I'm from this era of music and I love this stuff but the production was overdone with too much jumping around and not enough musical excellence.  After watching Eagles Farewell Tour I, this looked thrown together with too much fluff and not enough attention to the basics.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|This is a great cd with all of the hits that you remember..Sound quality is excellent...For some strange reason, have always liked Island of Lost Souls!  Buy Today!
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|MCR is a band I was hesitant to like for a while as I take pleasure in enjoying music most of my friends haven't heard of. However, despite an appearance on Saturday Night Live, I think you could say they're still pretty far from mainstream.<br /><br />The Black Parade is a strong, brilliant album. The song \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\" deservedly takes center stage. Its style of several songs rolled into one reminds me of Queen's 'The March of the Black Queen' and Green Day's 'Jesus of Suburbia.' I'm a big fan of complex arrangements. Other standout tracks for me include 'Teenagers' and the theatrical 'Mama,' which features cameo vocals by, of all people, Liza Minnelli.<br /><br />I hope MCR has staying power. I'm looking forward to more.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of, if not the very best science fiction/space adventure shows ever made.  I didn't even find out about it until it had already gone off the air.  The fans rallied, a movie was made, and it failed, too.  What is wrong w/people?  You have shows out there like Survivor and American Idol, so called reality shows that couldn't be farther from reality, but they are so popular they just keep making more and more and more of that type of junk.  Then you have a series like Firefly that gets canceled.  What is wrong w/people????  Thank goodness it's on DVD so it can be bought and viewed over and over again.  It's that good.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I took my son to the 3DG show in Mesa, AZ in May 2006.  We enjoyed it very much.  My son got to meet the band and they were great guys.  I purchased 1X on its release date, and it seems a little slow to write a review after almost a year, so sorry, but I'm late.  This production is great in every way possible.  From the first note to the last, it is addictive, and my esteemed spousal individual is probably tired of hearing it by now.  \\"Pain\\" is pleasure because, aside from the fact that it is a great song, there is nothing greater than the excitement in my four year old daughters eyes and her enthusiasm in singing along when this song comes on.  As for my seven year old son that I took to the show, he wants them to hurry up and put out something new.  Me, I love this one as well as their last, and look forward to their future works.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is a wonderful follow up to one of the best series ever made.  When there are over 3000 reviews and it's still got 5 stars over all, that tells you it's good.  And you don't even have to have seen the series to like this movie.  Just Awesome!
B000OCXFCO|3.0|There are 3 excelent Megadeth albums: \\"Pease sell... but who's buying\\", \\"Rust In Peace\\" (The Best), and \\"Countdown to Extinction\\". This album is ok for a band that is not what it used to be.     Anybody who thinks this album is one of the greatest is wrong, Don't know what Mustaine was able to do.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|OK it really seems like this album has drawn some battle lines.  I have liked Linkin Park since Hybrid Theory and I anxiously awaited the album.  I have listened to it many times and yes, there are some changes in their sound.  The first half of the album is basically the same Linkin Park we all know and love.  I like their use of clapping and the songs are catchy and get you pumped.  The second half of the album slows down dramatically and it sounds like they wanted to try a different direction.  There are a couple songs that miss, but its a nice change and overall the album is just fun to listen to.  You can't ever please the fanboys/girls though, they will find something to cry about.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|The first MATRIX film was interesting but I felt they held too much info back for too long.  By the time you understood the story, the movie was over.<br /><br />By the second movie, THE MATRIX RELOADED, the filmmakers got caught up in their own pretentious premise.  The dialogue just plays flat and weird.  Keanu Reeves looks either deep or...blank.  Couldn't tell which most of the time.  The truly-odd \\"Rave Scene\\" was so primitive and even bestial that I wondered why humans needed to survive at all.  Maybe the machines were on to something to exterminate such rampant barbarism and partying.<br /><br />The action scenes were very cool and the special effects extremely interesting.  I'm sure the filmmakers turned to talented effects people to shoot those scenes.<br /><br />If only they had turned to talented sci-fi writers to flesh out their script.<br /><br />Needless to say, this was the last MATRIX movie I saw in a theatre.
B00005NP04|4.0|Country music is a genre I usually tend to avoid like the bubonic plague. I find the majority of it annoying to the nth degree. I will though make the rare occasion with Johnny Cash, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Kasey Chambers, Lucinda Williams, and Martina McBride. I will admit that at one point I even owned a couple of Martina's cds over the years before my musical tastes evolved into something edgier, darker, and more aggressive.<br /><br />I recently got a hold of Martina's greatest hits from a several years ago. I almost forgot just how great of a singer she is compared to a lot of female artists nowadays (regardless of genre). I do though wish that \\"The Time has Come\\" from Martina's first album was on the album. Other than missing that particular song, I enjoyed listening to Martina's greatest hits especially \\"Independence Day\\" which for some ODD reason has kept Martina off some country radio's playlists to this very day. I guess the truth hurts. I am still emotionally moved by the lyrics. I don't know why since I have never been the victim of domestic abuse but the song resonates with me. I also still love \\"My Baby Loves Me\\" and \\"Safe in the Arms of Love\\" and \\"Wild Angels\\". As sappy as \\"Valentine\\" is, I actually like the song. Big guilty pleasure with me. A lot of the songs on the cd are new to me. I particularly like \\"Wrong Again\\". Great melodies.<br /><br />What I like about Martina's music is that it is never obnoxiously twangy which is why I hate most country music. Martina really has great taste in picking which songs she will put on her albums. The heartfelt lyrics, catchy melodies, and her powerhouse vocals are an excellent combination.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|It's funny how things occur, you know? I had never heard of Muse before I went to the My Chemical Romance concert where they opened. I was pleasantly shocked. They have this Queen-like vibe that I can't get out of my head. I like several of the songs on the album, but there seems to be more misses than hits. But that's alright, considering \\"Take A Bow\\", \\"Starlight\\", and \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" warrant the purchase of this CD.
B000OONTFU|5.0|I am surprised some people can give this product less than 5 stars because they only like (or get) the first movie. I was worried that something was really wrong with this set.<br /><br />I am only worried of the subtitled options. I can't find if the movies have english or spanish subtitles.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Our entire family loves Cars, including our two girls (ages 5 and 2). It is a wholesome movie that combines action (racing cars) with teaching lessons about being a friend, showing kindness, helping others, and learning what is really important in life. The characters are unforgettable (especially Mater), and the storyline is quite funny. Very cute movie and appropriate for children!
B000MTDRKE|5.0|Neal consistently puts out one great prog album after another.  This one is just as good as any of the others.  If he was born in the mid 40's, he'd be rich and famous.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|The beauty, the depth, and the mystery of this film are unsurpassable - what Kubrick was doing with light is just a miracle. Special lenses were designed to shoot interiors and exteriors in natural light. In one scene Barry (Ryan O'Neil) was having a dinner with a German woman who was feeding her baby and the candle light made the whole scene look like a Caravaggio's painting. This is just one of many scenes. Each of them is perfection and harmony. Costumes and sets were crafted in the era's design. Age of Enlightenment with its gallantry, wars, and duels, had been recreated in the film with the precision of the celebrated landscape and portrait masters of the period such as Thomas Gainsborough; Sir Joshua Reynolds, founder of the Royal Academy of Arts; George Romney to name just a few. If nothing else, watching \\"Barry Lyndon\\" is pure aesthetic delight - and there is one man responsible for it, Stanley Kubrick. If ever divine film was made, \\"Barry Lyndon\\" was it and Kubrick could've quoted the Bible - \\"God looked at everything he had made, and he found it very good\\".<br /><br />I've read the comments and articles that call \\"Barry Lyndon\\" cold, slow, boring, \\"the collection of pretty pictures', \\"flawed\\" masterpiece, and the most ridiculous one, \\"glittering ornament with a hollow center\\". I simply can't understand it. \\"Barry Lyndon\\" is the most compelling and compassionate realization of the inevitable finality of everything in this world which was presented by the visionary director with elegant sensual melancholy. Stanley Kubrick known for his detached, seemingly remote and non-sentimental style chose to reach out to his viewer directly during the epilogue, \\"It was in the reign of George III that the aforesaid personalities lived and quarreled, good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now\\". I don't recall any other movie that would illustrate the old wisdom, \\"everything will pass\\" in such sublime and deeply moving way.
B000001FDI|5.0|Soulful, emotional vocal melodies along with soothing and powerful guitar playing makes Blind Faith's one and only album truly deserving of your CD library.
B00005JPPI|2.0|Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) murders his wife Jenifer (Embeth Davidtz) after he discovers she is having an affair with police negotiater Rod Nunally (Billy Burke). Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) is a young lawyer on the rise who expects to easily win this \\"open and shut\\" case before moving on to making big bucks at a corporate law firm. But Crawford turns out to be a \\"brillant psycho\\" who has planned the \\"perfect murder\\".   <br /> <br />The first problem with this movie is that Crawford is by far the most interesting character and it's easy to find yourself rooting for him rather than Willy, who's sudden turn from ambitious professional climber to noble hero willing to sacrifice his career to nail the \\"bad guy\\" comes off as rather phony and unrealistic.  <br /> <br />The other major flaw occurs at the end when Willy is able to nail Crawford on an obvious technicality that any \\"brillant psycho\\" worth his salt would have easily seen coming. This one is unoriginal, full of cliches and an overall disappointment.
0316066524|5.0|I don't so much mind the footnotes.  That's what everyone gripes about, right?  It takes two bookmarks, it's too much work, there are footnotes to the footnotes and references between footnotes, etc.  But that's the way his brain works.  Each idea is excavated to an exhausting degree -- another common gripe.  But he has vision, he has unparalleled insight, and his character development makes me ache to jump into the page and know the characters.  Hearing what he has to say is one of my great pleasures in life.  I wait, fidgeting, on each interview, each essay, each fragment of prose that comes out of him, and when it comes I devour it whole.<br /><br />The much-maligned loose ends in IJ make the story MORE compelling.  Ever seen a David Lynch film?  DFW is a genius, and not in an ivory-tower sort of way.  He's twisted, gritty, sensual, and blindingly honest.  He gets it.  This book-as-project should be elevated to the top of your To Do list.
B000NA297O|4.0|this is a great show. very enjoyable, quick-witted and highly entertaining. but not enough interviews with the cast and such. the themed featurettes dont cut it. also where are the subtitles from season 3 onwards?
B00005JOHC|4.0|I don't understand y the USA hasn't gotten this on dvd, season 2 has been released here in Germany!! See a pic of the cover above. The show is called \\"Mein cooler onkel Charlie\\" in Germany!!
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Great CD!   HATE, the finger snapping on the first track, but skipping over that, every breath is exceptional.   Phrasing on Me & Mrs Jones makes it a Buble standard.   Love this CD
B00005JPD0|5.0|This movie was EXCELLENT!!  It filled my quench for action/fantasy .. a very good story line .. Denzel Washington was his usual casual 'into the part' actor .. very very good!!  I saw this movie TWICE and plan on seeing it again .. loved it!!
B000OCXMAE|4.0|This is the first Linkin Park album i have ever purchased. I was immediatley interested in them with their single \\"what i've done\\". I think all these a**holes who are trying to compare this to their other albums are approaching this in the wrong way. I believe that the guys from LP were merely trying something new, well new to them not to the radio. Yeah it has that emo sound, who cares it is about damn time they tried something new, few bands do that these days. I commend them and i enjoy this record alot. Buy it if you want something new to chill to.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|This movie was excellent!!  Acting was superb .. directing was outstanding .. I felt as though I was walking through it with all  <br />it's characters .. from beginning to end ..
B000NVIXFK|5.0|This cd is not for the easy-listener. The complex rhythms and poetic lyrics do not lend themselves (at least not initially) to a laid-back or passive mode of listening. There are songs on this new cd (like \\"Armor and Sword\\") that hark back to past RUSH recordings (\\"Hemispheres\\" or \\"Permanent Waves\\") while others are new, fresh and timely (\\"We Hold On\\").<br /><br />I am especially enamored with the instrumentals on this cd. \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" and \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" are quintessential and brilliant. The acoustic \\"Hope\\" is lush and, dare I say, hopeful.<br /><br />An impressive new cd by the boys from Toronto.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is so faithful to the book.  The book is fantastic and because this was a mini series, they took the time to do it right.  The performances from the smallest parts to the leads are excellent.  The mother, Mrs. Bennett is sensational as are the leads, Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.  This is the type of movie you watch over and over again.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|This cd is great. Rick Ruben strips down the nu metal sound and in return we get a very emotional cd.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|I've read that much of Mr. Knopfler's work is too derivative of other artists.  I had to laugh because when I heard the opening keyboard riff to \\"Everybody Pays\\", I immediately thought of \\"Whiter Shade of Pale\\".  But, at the end of the day...so what??  All popular music is derivative-this is a fact of life.   <br /> <br />This album illustrates what the maturation of a great artist/musician is really about.  The themes are more weighty, the music more subtle and textured, the mood somewhat laid back.  When you listen to this recording, you are listening to the voice of experience.  Mark understands his vocal limitations and doesn't bother to push the boundaries.  He also understands that a few well-placed hammer-ons, bends and pull-offs are all you need to state your case on the guitar.  Too many musicians have a tendency to over-play their instruments...like a chatty salesman whose afraid that he might not close the deal (he keeps talking to avoid any uncomfortable lulls in the conversation).   <br /> <br />If you begin to disect this record, you will find shades of J.J. Cale, Chet Atkins and Bob Dylan (as usual).  Mark has a somewhat nasal, raspy delivery in his singing, as well as a certain wry wit and literacy in his lyrics.  This is where the Dylan comparison comes from.  But Mark is a better musician, and that's that (although Bob's a better poet,not to mention a 60's icon/innovator).  Now, Mark's finger-picking style does owe a debt of gratitude to Chet Atkins-a great country/blue-grass guitar player.  However, Mark takes it to another level, and also shows an affinity for blues and rock which Mr. Atkins simply never possessed.  J.J. Cale, another great artist with similar sensibilities, seems to lack Mark's accessibility and overt sarcasm (see \\"Industrial Disease\\", \\"Money For Nothing\\", \\"Heavy Fuel\\", \\"My Parties\\", \\"Don't Crash the Ambulance\\", etc.). And, again, Cale cannot match Knopfler's virtuosity on the guitar either (he's pretty good, but never played ANYTHING on par with the solo/fills heard on \\"Sultans of Swing\\"-to name one example). <br /> <br />This record is a subtle, relaxed (and sometimes brooding) affair which focuses on moral decay, lost opportunities, lost innocence, bad business deals, tax dodging, physical illness, bad politics, class injustice and various other absurdities of life...the essence of the blues.  It doesn't burn like Dire Straits' \\"Making Movies\\" or aim for the market sweet-spot like \\"Brothers In Arms\\"...it just smolders.  Give it a listen.  You'll find some tasteful, rootsy guitar work, and some folk-rock style songs featuring interesting narratives.  Warning: don't look for any jolly songs about love/sex, syncopated dance rhythms or nifty synthesizer/drum loops-Britney Spears has this covered already.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|This was an awesome movie!  The family dynamics are intriguing and you'll love the mystery of the mother that returns from the grave.  There is one scene of partial nudity and some sexual content.  Other than that, the movie is pretty clean.   <br />La película es maravillosa!  Las mujeres luchan contra su mala suerte con sus hombres y tratan de arreglar su familia.  Penelope Cruz canta en una escena y es fabulosa.  Ojalá que yo pudiera cantar así!
B000AYELVA|1.0|First I should say that I have never read the comic books and rented this movie hoping it would be a fun adventure.<br /><br />The concept is a good one.  I like the idea of mutants with different abilities banding together in different camps to harm or help the rest of humanity. Magneto has the possibility of being a sympathetic, realistic bad guy because of his past (shown at the beginning of the movie) experiences.<br /><br />That is about all I can think of to say that's good.  The movie starts slow, with lots of exposition, when you are introduced to the characters, you are not given any reason to particularly care about them, and it doesn't get any better from there.  The bottom line is, the screenplay is terrible.  It drags, there is never really much of a sense of suspense, and the characters are not presented in a way that one can pull for them, with the possible exception of Patrick Stewart's character, but he isn't in most of the action scenes.  It's a shame, because with a great concept and some well-known actors, I would hope they would have better material to work with.<br /><br />I can imagine that this movie would appeal to young people who enjoyed the comic books and already like the characters and world.  If not, or if you are looking for something genuinely entertaining without plot holes all over the place, it is probably a waste of time.
0399230033|5.0|Every young child should have this book.  It is not many words, but the pictures do all the talking.  What a wonderful book with great artwork.  My son and I love reading this together over and over!
B000O75F7C|5.0|After the less than impressive [[ASIN:B000MGVBX2 Somewhere Else]] by Marillion, 2007 was not looking too promising for prog rock fans. But Porcupine once more saved the day! Their \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" is a direct reference to the Public Enemy album, [[ASIN:B0000024IE Fear of a Black Planet]] (1990) and it left me gasping for air after the first time I listened to it: so much musical power, so many layers of sound.<br /><br />It can be hard to imagine that barely six tracks can carry the burden of prog rock on their shoulders, but \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" does this task almost effortlessly. Steven Wilson repeats the same lineup he's had for the past five years. Besides them, the band is accompanied by King Crimson legend Robert Fripp on soundscapes in \\"Way Out Of Here\\", Rush's Alex Lifeson on guitar in \\"Anesthetize\\" and John Wesley, who had previously appeared on [[ASIN:B00006IU73 In Absentia]] and [[ASIN:B0007XT87G Deadwing]], also doing and producing guitar work.<br /><br />The end result is an amazing prog rock album that leaves the genre breathing comfortably and one of the best albums of 2007.
B000OCXFCO|1.0|This album is horrible. I fail to understand how people can give this album good reviews. There isn't one good song on this album, and it was as hard listening to as Metallicas St. Anger - maybe even harder. Dave Mustaine never was a good musician/guitarist/vocalist, but thanks to some very creative people (read Marty Friedman and David E) Megadeth somehow managed to release some great records. This is not one of them obviously, and it's quite clear to me, that Dave Mustaine is not capable of recording great records on his own. TWNAH, TSHF and this record is a perfect example of this.  <br /> <br />Anyway, I doubt that you would like this album, even if you're a Megadeth fan. Obviously some of the hardcore Megadeth fans have written some positive comment here, but I'm sure they know, that they're only kidding themselves. I know Megadeth fans wants Megadeth to do good - I would very much like that too - but there's no point in covering up the fact that this record sucks big time. Anyway, who am I kidding. I know that most people won't pay any attention to this review. I disregarded the poor reviews here on Amazon too, and bought the album. I regret that now though, and I'm sure most of you will too after buying it. <br /> <br />Regards.
B00004YZT5|5.0|Here's my thing: When you think of \\"Poison,\\" you think of 80's glam/punk.  This album is NOT from that, ummmm, idiom.  The songs on Native Tongue are just damn good - meaningful lyrics, mature song structures, and loaded with hooks.  The guitars are both blues-inflected and shred-era based, which makes Richie's style and sound both fresh and familiar at the same time.  This album is NOT the Poison you may know and love, but then, for me that's a good thing.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Best 'Deth CD since the RIP-Countdown era hands down...Buy it now! 15 year Megadeth fan telling you this.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|The quality is excellent, but I notice some unsmoothness of movement from one of the fly by filming. This was not noticable on standard resolution and only noticable when looking closely. <br /> <br />Recommended for showing good quality HD film for guests without a story that needs all attention.  <br />
B00012QM8G|5.0|Steven Spielberg made a lot of money out of his successful film, and yes, he also finally received an Oscar (Although I think some of his earlier work should receive one too). There are many interesting stories about the holocaust and WWII, and I wonder what attracted Spielberg to Schindler's story so much. Well, if you saw the film you can see that what Spielberg and Schindler have in common is money and ambition. Spielberg in my point of view is a great producer/business man. He knows how to make money (even for the Holocaust). I believe that is why Spielberg's so attracted to Schindler's character. Don't get me wrong, Spielberg has also values as well, and it is said that most of what the film has earned Spielberg donated to the Holocaust foundation. Spielberg is a franchise but I get the feeling that he cares. So in parallel to Schindler's character that evolves through the film, Spielberg uses the money he earns to make some good.<br /><br />Schindler is presented as a business man, who is interested in making money - actually a war profiteer. But something changes in his plan, Schindler learns slowly that the Nazi ideology is stupid and evil, and he goes on a process through the film of purging himself out of this ideology. He starts to care for \\"his Jewish workers\\", and by the end of the film he even cries, not for the loss of money, but for the life he could have saved.<br /><br />There are many scenes in this film, created in detail, through the help of survivor's testimonies. Some of them are extremely violent or contain nudity. Those scenes, which are shot brilliantly, are required for realism and I really like them, as I believe that such appalling violence is reserved only in film and not in our life.<br /><br />I find Schindler's List as a visual experience one should not miss, as it helps you grasp the horror and violence of the Nazis. Since Hollywood controls the world market of cinema, this movie is a breakthrough, bringing the story of the holocaust to the whole world.locaust to the whole world.
B000O178BY|5.0|Honestly how can you see it any other way? Just when we thought we'd never hear anything again 2 amazing new albums in 2 years. Trent is like a phoenix reborn anew and the new energy shows. Absolutely amazing work.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|I loved her first two albums -- 'Come Away with Me' is amazing. I used to play it so often that my male friends started to give me a hard time about it. I could die for the title 'Shoot The Moon'. I also liked her second album 'Feels Like Home'. But this one is simply bad. If I can get myself to give it another try and put it in my CD player, I always end up utterly dissappointed. <br />
B000OONTFU|5.0|\\"The Matrix\\" in high-definition video fulfils the prophecy of the A/V geek elders: this is audio and video of a higher order, a plunge into the future of home theater.<br /><br />The video has little in common with some of the jacked-up, overly hot presentations of older films we've seen in high-def formats. The colors, though muted by design, feel lush and true to the theatrical vision. The experience is that of watching moving images on film, not television or DVD. (The series was produced \\"with future technology execution in mind,\\" Warner points out.)<br /><br />High-def has rarely delivered the stunning audio we heard about when the formats first hit the market, but here it is. The rear soundstage doesn't sound subordinated: when the audio engineers send a jolt to a specific, discrete speaker, the result is powerful and distinct. The percussive sounds of gunfire are unlike anything I've heard on disc or in theaters. Some soft-spoken dialogue sounded indistinct or muffled from the center channel, but given the overall quality this is likely in the original elements.<br /><br />Flesh tones are true, but only on close-ups do you get that film-like definition. All that computer-land metal looks astounding; sharp with three-dimensional pop. When primary colors break through the algae-green atmospherics, they radiate but without the annoying signs of artificial boost.<br /><br />\\"The Matrix\\" was the first DVD title to sell more than a million copies back in the launch era. This set probably won't be a breakthrough for high-def, but it most certainly is a milestone in quality. The set is available only in HD DVD. Blu-ray Disc versions of both collections will be released later this year.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|This is the most fantastic CD Celtic Woman has recorded yet all of the people who post on our Website at the Celtic Woman Fan Site Forum say you can not pick just one song from this CD they all are #1 Songs. Once you start listing to this CD you will not be able to stop. You will want to hear it over and over again.
B00006879E|5.0|I love this CD.  I am not going to go into details about every song.  What I will say is this CD is one of the few CDs that I have ever had in my lifetime that I never tire of.  I have never tired of it, not one single song.  I can listed to the CD over and over and over again and everytime I hear something new, something I may have missed before.  I have never gotten bored with this CD, not one single song.  I cannot say that about many CDs.  I cannot wait for the new one to come out.  I have waited SO long, I hope it is as good as this one.  If you purchase this CD you will never be sorry.  Pure 100% listening pleasure over and over and over again!
B00005MP58|5.0|Well worth owning! This is the best version, every aspect of this movie works to create an enjoyable movie; costumes, actors, directing, scenery. Classic.
0140187650|5.0|Burned question like roll of Romania in holocaust, the little understanding about treacherous behave of Jewish leaders starting from supposing clever Jewish intellectuals of Germany, Hungary and Poland mentally paralyzed   by sneaky performance of Germany machine of extermination (I ask forgiveness to use \\"sneak\\" to try to explain the human's perfidy); the little silly Zionist mind of the strange Mr. Kastner and other Zionist fellows. Far more astonishing is how poor and failing was the human performance of these involuntary protagonists of the holocaust.   Let be clear: briefly  a tragedy expressed very well in this book.   And if we want to look straight in the eyes of following generations we have to accept our fallings and weaknesses and  by exposition of this tragic holocaust  trying to prevent future mistakes.     This Eichmann was nothing; what was in his mind is secondary and of no importance to his acts. The clerk of the dead Eichmann, was a primitive guy with unfortunate instincts to manipulate his victims. How was this guy, what was in his mind, how he perform is of no importance and this is the smallest revelation in Hanna Arendt book.
B000002JS8|5.0|Man, \\"Highway the Hell\\" has to be one of the greatest rock songs ever...I mean c'mon??? The riff, the lyrics, the beat, the production.....just flawless. This song and its accompanying album, released in July of 1979 put AC/DC into the stratosphere. No longer seen as dangerous rock n'roll underdogs, threatening to rape the headliners they supported in tours across the US and Europe over the last three years, they were now headlining superstars. Produced by the infamous Mutt Lange who would twiddle the knobs for 'Back in Black', Def Leppard's best selling albums and spouse, Shania Twain (how many records has this guy produced that have sold over ten million copies!!!!????), AC/DC provided their record company with a multi-platinum sound but kept their raunchy roll. Bon Scott's swan song (February 1980, RIP), there could be no better way to go for this gutter rat who became immortal and should be considered one of rock's greatest frontmen. Young, Young and Scott were not a lawfirm but a trio of short delinqents who crafted an absolute masterpiece of hard rock. \\"Highway to Hell\\" has already been gushed about but what about \\"Night Prowler\\", as pure a blues as the band ever did and pure malevolence. Why did they get so much crap for this song? Because Richard Ramierez chose it as his personal anthem (imagine if that psycho loved Slayer instead?)In no way should that hurt your enjoyment of any of the manic tunes on this landmark lp. \\"Shot Down in Flames\\" is awesome and funny (toss off buddy she's mine). \\"Girls Got Rhythm\\" is sort of a mission statement for rock stars....\\"got that backseat rhythm\\". \\"Walk All Over You\\" is beautifully diabolic with the best backing vocal track the band had done to date! \\"If You Want Blood\\" like \\"Highway\\" is an ode to the destructive lifestyle of bands who leave it all on the stage including their lifeforce....\\"Love Hungry Man\\" is probably the most underated track and \\"Touch Too Much\\" may be a bit to poppy (too much Mutt!) but both hold up their spaces on the track list. Pissing off the religious community with a doozy of a cover and title, AC/DC cemented their status as quite possibly the greatest pure rock band to walk the planet, but at the ultimate cost, the loss of their class clown and master of ceremonies. On the highway indeed....
B000LC55F2|4.0|A very pleasant surprise, The Prestige, brings to the screen the destructive enmity between two rival magicians who will go to great lengths to settle an old score. <br />Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, Andy Serkis and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful! <br />In short, The Prestige is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! <br />
B000002JSV|5.0|Why doesn't this record get the respect it deserves??? No radio play, though it is much better than either 'High Voltage' or 'Dirty Deeds'. Some music guides call it a misstep...or a not ready for prime time record. 'Powerage' is easily one of the band's top five classics and maybe because it isn't as overexposed as the lps that preceeded or came after it is why I love it so much. I do agree that it does represent the end of an era, the last Australian reoorded album and until 1988's \\"Blow Up Your Video\\", the last produced by Harry Vanda and George Young. 'Powerage' was the record before Atlantic Records poured more money into the band and demanded a more commercial sound. While history may have proved the corporate bigwigs right, can 'Powerage rock as heavily and memorably as anything AC/DC has put out? Of course it can and the band is running on all cylinders here with new boy Cliff Williams on bass. Some of Bon's best lyrics show up in classics such as \\"Sin City\\", one of their alltime greatest and a tribute to Vegas. \\"Down Payment Blues\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Damnation\\" bemoan the rock n'roll lifestyle (got myself a cadillac, but I can't afford the gasoline....ma's own whippin' boy\\"). \\"Up to My Neck in You\\", \\"Gone Shootin\\" and \\"Kicked in the Teeth\\" speak of self destructive relationships and dangerous women ('wishin' this neck wasn't mine...two faced woman with your two faced lies\\"). The brothers Young, who outdid themselves with 'Let There Be Rock', create another monster guitar sound and \\"Riff Raff\\" is devastation deluxe and as one magazine called it awhile back...\\"bonecrushing boogie\\", perfect! Why are people saying the second half is a letdown? \\"Neck\\" and \\"Teeth\\" close the record in thunderous fashion. New Wave and Punk were called innovative and significant by the mainstream press (hello Rolling Stone!) but AC/DC was already a tribute to the undying power of rock and near the peak of their powers during the Bon Scott Era....now all they needed was one iconic anthem/album to put them over the top...
B000A2X9ZQ|4.0|Sahara brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, the spread of a deadly plague and its effect on the people in the region of northwest Africa, and on the other, the treasure hunt for the Civil War era CSS Texas and its legendary cargo of gold.     <br />In short, the acting is pretty good (Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, and Penelope Cruz carry out their performances well, though by no means are they the performances of their lives) while the plot, the music, and the action/special effects are very good. <br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment.  3.5 Stars <br />
0385340559|3.0|Yes, Lee Child is an engaging writer. And indeed, he has, apparently with a straight face, made Reacher to be some kind of superhuman protagonist, however strained this might be to some readers. Even Ian Fleming never posited such abilities to his James Bond. This time Reacher has a mathematical bent. Can we now expect a hitherto unheralded talent in each upcoming novel?<br /><br />A flaw spoils the narrative, quite aside from Reacher's abilities. In the opening scene, and in subsequent developments, victims are dropped from a helicopter onto the desert, while still alive. They are not shot first. The reason given is that this prevents ballistics from a bullet implicating the shooter. Thus we get gripping scenes of hapless persons fully conscious, while plunging to their doom.<br /><br />Utterly implausible. For ballistics to be useful, there has to be both a link from the bullet to a gun and from that gun to its owner. The villains have enough resources and planning time to obtain untraceable guns. They could shoot the victims first, and discard the guns. Which also lessens the risk when dropping victims from the helicopter, because there is no chance of them struggling. Plus, most of the villains are ex-cops. They would certainly know how to get untraceable guns. I'm not just speculating. The heroes, who themselves are ex-cops (ex-military that is), obtain such guns. Probably unintended irony. Child has inadvertently furnished a refutation of his own scenario. The book is not internally consistent. (Quite separate from whether you regard Reacher as some comic book superhero or not.)<br /><br />But you see what would happen if Child removed this inconsistency? It would also remove a key aspect of the drama. Some readers will say this is justified. Others would lament Child spoiling the book, by not turning his ingenuity to more plausible twists. Now, if you are already a fan, then by all means read this book. Just keep your wits about you, and don't turn off your analytic facilities. THINK while you read. Don't just let the narrative flow like a stream of consciousness.nalytic facilities. THINK while you read. Don't just let the narrative flow like a stream of consciousness.
055358202X|2.0|Now that Feast of Crows has been out there for a while its back to the waiting game for the next installment.  Granted, we can't expect the author to conjure up a story overnight but at the current pace, assuming there are two more books left in the series it seems like we won't see the conclusion to this series for awhile meaning many, many years from now, if ever.  I've been to the author's website and read his blogs and sense that he is becoming frustrated with everyone clammering him to finish the series.  However, from a reader's point of view, its frustrating to get sucked into a storyline and then having to wait years for the next installment whereupon you forget the details of the previous books and with a series like this there are ALOT of details (plot, characters, places, etc).  So the reader either has to re-read the old books (which isnt an overnight read) or just dive into the new book and hope that memory serves them well.  But there is another option, which can only be chosen by those that havent started reading this series yet.  DON'T START.  Wait until the series is finished and done. That will save you the frustration of being sucked in and then waiting with very,very high expectations for the next part.  It will save you grief in the long run and should also save the author grief because you will be one less person that will be pleading for him to finish the next book!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|The \\"V for Vendetta\\" DVD set actually deserves 10 stars. The movie MUST be viewed this way, in the widescreen format(it's truly amazing)and the special features are very entertaining. I loved the hidden bonus track.
0792164903|5.0|For me everything works and looks brilliant on this film.  Great script, wonderful performance by Depp and a surprising choice with Ricci and, even more surprising, she truely delivers.  Most important, Burton nails this whimsical gothic tale and, in my humble opinion, created a film classic.  Highly, highly recommended.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I am a huge linkin park fan. I loved Meteora and Hybrid Theory. Those past two alboms had it all the rock, rap and trurn tables. Minutes to Midnight is different, but good. I wasn't so excited when I heard LP was changing the style for this new album. But when I got it on May 15th and listen to it I believed it to be a risk but is was a good one. I would most likely say Given Up, Bleed it Out, and What I've Done are probably the most similar to the albums that LP has made in the past. If you are a hardcore LP fan and love there music this is diffently the ablum to get. <br /> <br />YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING IS THE WORTH TO GET OR IS IT JUST A WASTE OF MONEY. I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, IT IS DIFFENTLY WORTH GETTING MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT!
B00005N6KG|4.0|I workout and run a fair amount and these headphones are perfect for me. I have big ear canals so most ear bud headphones slip out whenever I'm running or moving, so I generally stick to the wrap-around family of headphones. The sound quality is generally good and I've found that the headphones last a fair amount of time (this is my second pair in 3 years). And considering the fact that I listen to music and then generally shove my headphones and iPod into my backpack, it's saying a lot.  <br /> <br />These are great headphones for the active individual especially considering the value.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|ABSOLUTELY HATE IT!!!!  I loved Linkin Park's earlier brilliant and highly influential work, but this CD is a HUGE disappointment!!!  These have to be the reject songs that didn't make it onto the first two CDs.  As far as I am concerned, LP is dead and another band is doing a terrible impersonation.  All the genius is gone.  Any band could have put this slop together.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|I cannot believe what has happened to Linkin Park.  I'm not sure if...well I have no words to describe how I feel about this alblum.  It started out good.  Nice little intro, first song pretty decent.  Then they turn into U2.  My wife even said one song reminded her of backstreet boys.  I read that somebody said that if you don't like this album you are a sell out.  Well I'm sorry to say that LP has sold out.  How can you completely change your style from nu-metal to emo?  I HATE emo and that is exactly what this cd reminds me of.  Tracks 2,4 and 8 are quality LP songs but the rest are good but not what you would want from linkin park.  If I wanted to listen to those type of songs I would buy a U2 cd.  LP became popular because of their unique style of music and they have totally abandoned that.  I guess they want new fans because they lost this one.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Helen Mirren is wonderful. The movie is great.  The subject matter: fascinating.  The movie is one of the best I have ever seen, without question.
0374105235|5.0|This is a fabulous book.  Although the subject matter sounds depressing, and  Beah's experiences in war-torn Sierra Leone are horrific, this is a very uplifting book, reminding us of the triumph and power of the human spirit.  Beah writes well, and you feel like you are hearing from an old friend.  I read this while on vacation, in about 2 hours time.  I almost didn't want to finish it.  Provides more than a glimpse into a world to which we in the Western world are too quick to turn a blind eye.  Powerful, sad, and uplifting at the same time. And the picture on the back is testament to Beah's amazing spirit - you can see only joy in his face.  I look forward to hearing more about what Beah does with his life.  This is a must read!
B000002KJM|5.0|YEAH THE MIXES BLOW BUT BETTER TO SEE WHAT YOUR MISSIN' THAN NEVER KNOW.
B000I5X81K|5.0|There is quite a bit of variety and catchy songs in this musical piece--songs in Italian, Spanish and English from the romantic to quicker pace.  And if you can catch this talented 26-year old in concert, you will have a perfect combo.  I'm proud to see young talent recognized by both young and more mature audiences from 20 to 60!!!
B000NVIGC0|5.0|When I don't care for a cd after the first few listens, that's usually a positive sign. That's the case for Sky Blue Sky. After about the 5th full listen, I've concluded this is another brilliant outing for Tweedy and co. <br /> <br />There's a giant melting pot of influences here: Lennon/Mccartney, the Grateful Dead, Big Star,Dylan, Woody Gutherie, Radiohead, etc. I'm sure after some more listens, I'll come up with a few more. It's impossible to put Wilco in a box. Tweedy refuses. <br /> <br />Like one reviewer said, this is where Wilco is now, enjoy the journey and please listen diligently and I think all will realize that Tweedy is one of America's great talents.
B000QI2ZWW|2.0|I wanted to watch this since it was on the theaters.  Now I am just wondering what all the excitement was about.  This is a rather dark film.  It doesn't have the happyness, joy, or even sadness of the first Toy Story.  It's just a dark moody film.  There is very little time when you think something good will actually happen. <br />  On the good side, the human faces were some of the best done (unless they were real faces) in computer animation. <br />  The movie also looks good on HD Tivo.   Unfortunately Amazon still doen't have very many animated movies.  I would highly reccomend any of the ICE AGE movies more than this.
6305842442|1.0|VERY DISPOINTING SET HAS THE SAME DVD AVAILABLE ALL READY WITH JUST ONE VERISON, THERE WAS VHS VERSION THAT HAD THE NARRATION AND MORE GRAPHIC SCENES THAT WERE DELETED IN THE THEATRICAL VERSION FOR BEING TO GRAPHIC WHY CANT WE GET THIS VERSION ON DVD WHATS UP!
B00005OAIE|5.0|Although, I have been critical of John Mayer in the past, if you have an opportunity to hear this CD, you'll know why I say this is the most redeeming set of songs he has to offer. From the, makes you wanna sing, Georgia Why, to the soulful, Back To You, this is John Mayer, when he's not banging out guitar licks, a more mellow John Mayer. To give you an idea how well I like this CD...I purchased it retail, I play it on my CD player in my car, it's on my MP3 player and it's on my computer at work and at home. I can listen to it any time of the day. And I do.
0385751060|5.0|While there has been much debate over the credibility of the historical facts in the story, I don't find this of particular personal relevance. The book tells the story of 9-year-old Bruno who lives in high society Berlin. Seen through his eyes, the reader is taken into a world that Bruno cannot make sense of (his father wears a uniform, they have the \\"Fury\\" over for dinner, and they unexpectedly move to \\"Out-With\\") and that he can only comprehend in the way a child can. While 9 might be a little old for a child to be this naive, the point of the story is to bring us into a subject matter that will always be difficult to understand. By putting us on the other side of the fence, on the side where the Nazi party and their children live, we are brought into a world that is scary for young Bruno although not nearly as scary as it is for his friend Shmuel, the title character on the other side of the fence. <br /> <br />To analyze the historical inconsistencies doesn't appeal to me as, the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors, I didn't feel like the book did a disservice by placing Bruno with his father rather than in the Hitler Juden. The book is remarakably touching and simple, yet contains some beautiful sentences evocative of a writer who successfully gets to the heart of human evil and cruelty. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in reading about the Holocaust, whether young or old, whose tale of a friendship speaks volumes about the what we as humans choose not to see.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|I'm (yikes!)41 y.o. and I've been to at least 2 shows every tour since the Signals album.  I think this is their best work in 20 years.  Really great tunes.  Wonderful rock album.  It's inspiring to me as a musician, and a fan!
B000003S2O|5.0|Ambient 4: On Land is definitely a dark piece of work.  But it isn't dark in an evil or foreboding way.  Rather, Brian Eno has created a very organic album, full of captivating sounds.  The music here is dense and imaginative, each track laying the groundwork for a long ago twilight in rural England.  Just as Kind of Blue can function either as a compelling listen or as background music, Ambient 4 presents a quiet, subdued audio image, but there is also a lot to hear.    The tracks themselves don't tell the whole story.  You create the details yourself.   It's almost like the sounds you'd hear whilst camping -- and the soundscapes are teeming with life.  Outdoor wallpaper almost.  And the track titles do a fine job of evoking such visualizations: \\"Lizard Point\\" opens the album, and we move through \\"The Lost Day\\" -- and -- a \\"Shadow.\\"  Finally we arrive at the spooky \\"Lantern Marsh\\" and the wistful \\"Unfamiliar Wind\\" -- and then -- \\"a Clearing.\\"  What lies beyond the Clearing?  \\"Dunwich Beach\\" I suppose.    Perhaps one of this recording's finer points is that it's completely unpretentious.  It is not an hour of synthesizer drones masquerading as some major achievement, like a lot of the ambient electronic music of the 1990s.  Yet this album is an achievement not simply for its sheer simplicity and innovation, but also because it still sounds fresh and interesting 25 years later.
B00005RZV4|5.0|_And All That Could Have Been_ is a live album that initially sounds like a studio recording - clear, precise, and nearly flawless. Now mix in the raw energy and power of a live performance and you get this intense masterpiece that will please NIN fans worldwide. <br /> <br />So, what's on this CD? About half of the songs are reworks from _The Fragile_, and include \\"The Frail,\\" \\"The Wreteched,\\" \\"The Great Below,\\" and \\"The Mark Has Been Made.\\" _The Fragile_ not being one of my favorite NIN albums, I was a little skeptical about this CD... until I listened to it. In my opinion, these live and reworked versions tend to be BETTER than the originals (especially \\"The Wretched\\"). Live versions of songs from other albums are also included, with hits like \\"Closer,\\" \\"Sin,\\" \\"Head Like a Hole,\\" and others completing the almost 74 minutes of music on this CD. Buyers will definitely get their money's worth. <br /> <br />Note: _And All That Could Have Been_ was originally sold as two CDs. The second CD is not contained in this package, and had numerous \\"softer\\" and near-acoustic versions of various songs on it. That CD is currently being sold as the album _Still_.

B000MQC9H4|3.0|The Holiday is predictable, but sometimes drinking a glass of wine and watching a well done romantic comedy does a girl good. Writer-Director Nancy Meyers, who made Something's Gotta Give, seems gifted at producing romance that has an edge of originality to it.  Her characters surprise us with their modernity -and diverge from searching for prince charming fluff.  The cast is exceptional - Kate Winslet is fantastic in perhaps one of her first uber-commercial roles.  Jude Law - well who couldn't stare at him for two hours, and he can act!  Jack Black tones down the mania and proves like so many talented comedians that he can really act in dramatic roles, and he is actually more palatable turned down a few notches.  Cameron Diaz sticks out in this crowd of talent by failing to fully deliver a believable character, and her character seems intended to be the most unconventional of the four.  It is hard to believe Jude Law, despite his sincere and dewy eyes, when he says to her \\"you are the strangest girl I've ever met\\", because Diaz is about as \\"strange\\" as LA-Barbie.  One can't help but think that the role deserved a quirky and lovable performance such as Winslet's in The Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind.  Nevertheless we cheer for her to overcome her intimacy issues, and the film wraps up with a big red bow tied around it, and everyone spending New Years Eve in love.  The film gets bonus points for making fun of itself.  As far as \\"holiday\\" movies go, you could do worse.
B000003TA4|5.0|Some of these negative reviews are kind of ridiculous. First of all, it's absurd to judge the band Nirvana based on this one album. They released several other albums and recorded tons of other songs (many of which never made it to record.) The great thing about Nirvana was that b-sides like \\"Even in His Youth\\", \\"Moist Vagina\\", \\"Laundry Room\\", etc. were all outstanding. Bleach, In Utero, Incesticide, Outcesticide, Unplugged album...these are all great albums. It's hard to think of a band who is this consistent. <br /> <br />Second, saying Kurt Cobain was not a brilliant songwriter is your opinion, and you're entitled to it. But millions of people think he was. His ability to write basic, yet brilliant and haunting, melodies is unmatched in my opinion. Not as prolific as Lennon, sure, but I believe he wrote better songs. Go listen to \\"Do Re Mi\\" on you tube. Its one of the last songs he ever wrote and the only recordings of it are terrible quality and scratchy, yet the brilliance shines through. His rendition of \\"Where did you sleep last night\\" on unplugged says it all as well. If that's not \\"genius\\" I dont know what is. <br /> <br />As for this album, the guy who gave this album 3 stars for Rolling Stone was JUST ONE GUY. At the time the review came out, no one had heard of this band and he was probably the only one who listened to it at Rolling Stone. I hate to defend Rolling Stone because they suck in my opinion, but the fact that they raved about Nirvana later has nothing to do with how \\"overhyped\\" nirvana had become. In fact, Nirvana was the opposite of overhyped. They gained popularity through word of mouth and local djs playing their music, then mtv caught on, etc. etc...they had no marketing whatsoever from their label. The songs just struck a chord with people unlike any band I can remember in my lifetime. This is not their best album and it does not contain their best songs by any means, but it is still a great album--overrated only in comparison to Nirvana's other music.

B00005NB0H|5.0|Soon after Tommy was released in the United States, my dear friend Baum obtained tickets for a group of our close friends to see The Who perform Tommy at the Fillmore East with the Joshua Light Show.   That was among a number of musical events I shall never forget.  To this day, details of that show remain as clear as the evening it went down. <br /> <br />This Deluxe Edition is outstanding, both sonically and musically.   If you are a fan of The Who, this is a must have.   Don't even think twice.  Get a copy, buckle in, crank it up, and immerse yourself in the experience only great rock n' roll can provide. <br /> <br />My only complaint is we had to wait so many years for this to be released in its full show glory.  Past is past.   Grab it now !!
B000QI2ZWW|1.0|I was horribly disappointed by the first two minutes of this film.  Why only the first two minutes?  Because that is all that I watched.  I rented it to watch with my five-year-old daughter, for I had heard great things about this film.  Well, the movie opens with a female penguin singing a song by Prince,... \\"you don't have to be beautiful to turn me on... All I want is your body from dusk till dawn....\\"  In the background, the male panguing are singing, \\"Let's talk aboue Ex, baby,\\" to the tune of, you guessed it, let's talk about sex, baby.  I felt this was very inappropriate for children.  My husband stopped the DVD and we didn't even watch it.    And, yes, I am very protective of my children and what they watch, but if I don't do it, who will?  So, if you worry about the sexual inuendo's that have the ability to influence your children, I reccomend finding something different to watch.

0689853637|5.0|I work as a substitute teacher and shared this book all through the winter months with my students.  What a treat to watch a severely sight-challenged child gently run her hands around the exquisite art work!  Other students, of all ages, delighted in the details on each of the pages.  And because I could make the last page light without the children noticing that I was pulling the tab, they would respond with awe!  It is now May.  I was tickled in my return to a classroom this week, when a young boy's excitement to see me turned to disappointment after he learned I didn't have any of my Robert Sabuda books with me.  You will not be disappointed in this work!

0575077859|5.0|One of the worst things about a new fantasy series is the lack of true characters that leap off the page. Mighty Joe has three...including one of the best anti-heroes to come along in a long time: Sand dan Glotka, a former swordsman and hero left a cripple after being tortured for two years in an enemies prison. Abercrombie really captures the reader and sweeps them into what would be a pretty basic plot..except that through the characters and how they think and feel gives it a completely new and different spin.<br /><br />As a new writer, there are some slight flaws. But overall, this is an assured first tome from a very gifted writer. His wry irony and savage wit is crafted into the chapters and commentary. Very enjoyable read and I am looking forward to reading book 2 and following his writings.<br /><br />If you want to compare him to someone, perhaps R. Scott Bakker's Prince of Nothing series comes closest. Another fine series and author worth your time.
B000NA77YO|5.0|Well, well how come nobody told me this era of Sabbath was not only this good, but THIS GOOD? I discovered metal music around -83 so my memory banks tell me that a cooler new school was around and that my own musical prejudices probably prevented me from having the foresight to discover some classic music. Sure DIO was around but to me it all sounded a little old fashioned at that point, I wanted spandex, teased hair and something a bit more threatening. Roll on 25 years or so and over the last couple of years I have welcomed RJD into my CD collection but only through some Rainbow and a predominantly Osbourne era Sabbath best of. I had no idea that the quality and magic of this era of Sabbath was something I really needed to become acquainted with. And then an even bigger surprise the stuff from the \\"Dehumanizer\\" release sounds as good if not perhaps better. I missed two chances to have many more years of classic rock to listen to. I won't bother to give you individual song reviews cause as indicated above I am a virgin to these wondrous sounds (a 40 year old DIO in Sabbath virgin) but I can tell you this CD does what the great \\"best of\\" does best , namely it makes you want to go out and buy the full back-catalogue. Not since the mighty Judas Priest's \\"Metal Works\\" has such a pleasant surprise come to my ears and I sense the beginning of a new love affair. This line-up needs to hang around.
0743496728|3.0|Like most readers, I had trouble putting this book down...for the first half, or maybe two-thirds. Then, like other readers, I got tired of reading about the shooter's parents wondering \\"Where did we go wrong.\\"  So I peeked ahead to the ending. The twist was a surprise. I'm still not sure if it's realistic.<br /><br />Except for that twist, the book reads like a detailed case study of a high school shooting. Those who followed the Virginia Tech story, the Columbine story and other school shooting stories may have a sense of deja vue. An abused, bullied teen finally explodes.<br /><br />In real life, killer teens often turn the gun on themselves. Here the killer gets led away early in the book. The trial scenes reminded me of documentaries of teens accused of crimes, whether guilty or partly guilty (as in the recent Frontline episode) or completely innocent (as in Paradise Lost - an awesome film).<br /><br />In the end, while we can't fault the author, there's little surprise here. We don't find ourselves with new insights or new ways to look at a problem that's gained huge attention in the media.<br /><br />As a non-parent, non-teacher, I was appalled by the acts of cruelty perpetuated by \\"ordinary\\" teens toward Peter, the shooter. Picoult does show us that there's no easy answer. Peter's mother, Lacy, tries to help but makes things worse. Her husband, a stereotypically detached academic, teaches Peter to shoot, thus preparing the way for this massacre.<br /><br />And as a non-parent, I didn't feel sympathetic to Alex, the newly appointed judge who has trouble relating to Josie. When Josie attains maturity, Alex gives her a book on statistics. Realistic? I find that hard to believe.<br /><br />I didn't feel sympathetic to Lacy, the killer's mom, either. Don't these educated professionals read books on bringing up children? Have they considered hiring a psychologist?<br /><br />Picoult's writing is superb - she knows how to create a page-turner. No doubt I'll be back for the next.  Reading Picoult is like eating ice cream. I won't be satisfied. I may decide not to finish. But I'll enjoy the experience, at least while I'm there.o doubt I'll be back for the next.  Reading Picoult is like eating ice cream. I won't be satisfied. I may decide not to finish.

B000OCXFCO|5.0|Dave Mustaine did it again!  He kept his promise and gave us Megadeth and true Heavy Metal fans an outstanding metal recording.  \\"United Abominations\\" is the real deal.  Such intense songwriting, lyrics, music and complexity.  This will go down as a heavy metal masterpiece whether it sells a million copies or not!!! I am just wondering how is Metallica is going to outdo this recording by \\"Dangerous Dave Mustaine!!!\\"  Long live MEGADETH!!! Update: Sep 5, 2009.  O.K....looking back from this time perspective Metallica's \\"Death Magnetic\\" album was a far superior relase compared to United Abominations, even with the complaints of the sound quality of Metallica's latest release. And I admit that I overrated United Abominations a little bit.  But Megadeth's finest hour can be heard in thier newest release....\\"ENDGAME\\".

B000002I6X|5.0|STEPHEN STILLS 2 is better than Stephen Stills' self-titled debut, which contained the godawful (and overplayed) \\"Love The One You're With\\", which is so annoying that even B-vitamins and omega-3 oils won't make it any less so. This CD includes wonderful songs such as \\"Change Partners\\" and several others that are complex enough lyrically and musically that a diet rich in the above nutrients is necessary to truly appreciate this masterpiece, and even then, it still takes repeated listening to fully \\"get\\" what Stills was up to here. This one is far superior to sometime bandmate David Crosby's concurrent solo CD IF ONLY I COULD REMEMBER MY NAME, which is so inscrutable that you'd need lots of fish and whole grains in your diet to get the nutrients that would help you to even make sense of it. Stills' belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug-smuggling was falsely convicted makes STEPHEN STILLS 2 an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B00008NRI8|5.0|TWO WEEKS NOTICE is one of my favorite movies. There. I said it. Read on to see why I love this movie. <br /> <br />TWO WEEKS NOTICE is the story of Lucy (Sandra Bullock), a very. . . It's hard to describe her. She aspires to be a great lawyer - and in truth is - but she settles to work at Legal Aide and do pro-bono work instead of going and making money. Until she meets George Wade (Hugh Grant!). <br /> <br />George Wade is a multi-millionaire businessman, the face of Wade Corporations. He hires Lucy while he is in need of an assistant. They make a bargain - she'll work for him and help him get his building built, but he must keep the Coney Island Community Center. This works - for a while. <br /> <br />Lucy finally gets fed up with George's late night calls and strange demands and his lack of R-E-S-P-E-C-T (see movie for joke). So she gives him her two weeks' notice. But the thing is, Lucy is in love with George, but is too prideful to admit it. <br /> <br />This movie is so well written and well done overall. Hugh Grant does a wonderful job as George, whether you want to admit or not. He and Sandy Bullock may not have perfect chemistry, but they are so funny together. There are moments in the movie that make me laugh out loud. And I rarely laugh out loud.  <br /> <br />LUCY: I think you are the most selfish person on the planet, George. <br />GEORGE: That's just silly. Have you met everyone on the planet? <br /> <br />See this movie. It's genuinely funny.
B000GUJF4G|5.0|My teenage daughter and I are both fans of the original, so we approached this one with some trepidation...remakes usually fall short, and disaster flicks are MEANT to be cheesy, so how good could this be? <br /> <br />Well, we were pleasantly surprised!  There wasn't a lot of character development, and I had trouble for a while distinguishing one female character from another, but it was a good, fun, adventurous thrill ride, a great Sunday afternoon popcorn movie.   <br /> <br />We give it our own two thumbs up.
0385333846|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book and thought it posited an interesting theme; that time, at least the way most of us conceptualize it, does not actually exist.<br /><br />Vonnegut presents this idea through the experiences of the main character, Billy Pilgrim, who is said to have become \\"unstuck in time.\\"  Throughout the book, Billy's present surroundings constantly fluctuate between his past, present, and future self (or selves).  He also spends time on the planet Tralfamadore, where the inhabitants see time in four dimensions, accept their futures as unchangeable (because they've already seen them), and are aghast when Billy questions them about free will.<br /><br />Consequently, Billy develops a fatalistic irreverence towards life and shrugs off seemingly catastrophic events with an attitude wholly captured by Vonnegut's go-to phrase \\"so it goes.\\"  To the reader, his attitude is often very humorous, particularly when it's juxtaposed against the worrywort nature of other characters.<br /><br />Initially, one assumes this form of nihilism is a shot against religion; however, to Christians adhering to a Lutheran, and to a greater extent Calvinistic, interpretation of predestination and free will, Vonnegut's them isn't so bizarre.  In fact, it may even be a challenge to those Christians to live like the Tralfamadorians, free of worry and anxiety because they too already know their fate.<br /><br />Cool book.  Highly recommend.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|This is not the experimental, push the boundaries, 17 minutes of guitar feedback at the end of a song Jeff Tweedy.  The songs are less complicated and less bombastic (some might say less interesting, but I would disagree).  I loved the albums before this for their creativity and inventiveness and was willing to put up with the occasional \\"out there\\" miss (or 17 minutes of guitar feedback), but I have to say this is the most enjoyable Wilco CD in quite a long time in terms of sheer songwriting, tunefulness, Tweedy's voice, and the impeccable and tasteful guitar work on display here.  I agree with the reviewer who compared this to John Lennon's solo work and I am also reminded of when Dylan followed up Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde (two of the greatest albums of all time) with a back-to-basics folky approach on John Welsey Harding (even when everyone around him was getting deeper into psychedelia and overdubbing etc.).  This wouldn't be my first Wilco CD to recommend to a new fan (that would probably be Being There or YHF) but for an old fan, I kind of like the new direction Tweedy's taken.  He certainly does not seem content to repeat himself over and over again, as some artists are.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|I am a big Michael Buble fan and I honestly could not wait for this album to be released. Unfortunately, to me, this album isn't as good as the previous ones. I do not love jazz but Buble made me love it with his previous albums by giving songs a modern twist, and by using great musical arrangements and picking songs that are rythmic. This album is definitely more slow. It lacks a little punch, but at the same time, Michael Buble's voice is just so pure and crystaline that it still carries you miles away.

There are enough new ideas to excuse the re-used ones. But combined with the inconsistent writing, this is a hard book to like.

Then he gets mugged for the crime of marveling at this strange new world, which has such things in it, because the things in it don't have much time or sympathy for the new kid in town, and they're happy to kill him for what he's got in his suitcase.\\"<br /><br />The first sentence is a little long, and a simile, but not too bad. The second sentence has six separate dependent phrases, ten (!) prepositions and two different verb tenses. A high school sophomore would get chewed out for writing that kind of sentence. And yet in the next paragraph, Scalzi writes:<br /><br />\\"I spent seventy-five years on Earth, living mostly in the same small Ohio town and sharing most of that life with the same woman. She dies and stayed behind, I lived and left.\\"<br /><br />See how much more effective those short, simple sentences are? And see how jarring it is to have one follow another? This happens over and over through the novel, and for me, at least, it was very distracting. I don't think it is just a former English teacher over-reacting. It's just bad writing or editing.<br /><br />I liked some of Scalzi's ideas, but found his writing - or the editing - detracted from the pleasure of reading the book.

B000MZHW40|4.0|The screenplay of \\"Blood Diamond\\" may not be the best of the year, but it is certain that the strong performances from the leading stars are one of the greatest in the year 2006. Like many of the recent films shot in Africa such as \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" or \\"Tsotsi,\\" Edward Zwick's film, which is set against the background of the civil war in Sierra Leone back in 1999, has a strong message or two about the present condition of Africa. <br /> <br />The film's story doesn't need a lengthy summery; it is after all about two characters: South African-born mercenary-turned diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), and Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a father and fisherman living in Sierra Leone abducted by a rebel army RUF (Revolutionary United Front). You will see these two people connected by one big, pink rock, a precious diamond hidden somewhere in the land of civil war-torn Sierra Leona. <br /> <br />The strongest part of the film is, as I said, the acting from Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou, both truly in character. Jennifer Connelly also appears as journalist Maddy Bowen and Arnold Vosloo as \\"Colonel,\\" but the film belongs to the two, DiCaprio and Hounsou. The locations of Africa are also spectacular and realistic with the photography of Eduardo Serra (\\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\"), something you can see nowhere but in this land. <br /> <br />Still I must say \\"Blood Diamond\\" is not perfect, like any other films. One weakness is its script with too many coincidences and familiar plot devices. Actions are powerful with guns and explosions, but these actions may be a little too powerful for the film to stress more effectively the immediate and complex issues in Africa. In fact, in \\"Blood Diamond\\" you find more than one serious issues - one about diamonds and other natural resources, or about the child soldiers, for instance - but they are overshadowed by the often melodramatic storytelling, which in itself is strong, but could have been better with a more restrained approach. <br /> <br />Still \\"Blood Diamond\\" shines with two excellent performances. It is flawed, but worth buying now. <br />
0307237699|4.0|The writing flows smoothly. It is easy to read. It is a reasonable look at American history and politics. The junior Senator views critical issues from more than one side. He is obviously trying to place himself somewhere in the middle of the political spectrum. Mr. Obama has charisma and proves that he is a good writer, but it would be an unacceptable risk to make one so untested into a war-time president. Remember after Nixon Americans hoped for the best with someone new and fresh, Jimmy Carter, also untested. And what a disaster that was for the country!   The book itself is really five stars but I subtract a star, because the author is just too ambitious (too much audacity?) for the good of the country. He is not ready. We are at war. It is not a game. True, things are not going as planned. But that is not a reason to put in a rookie and hope for the best. He may just be too soft. An indication that the junior Senator is not strong enough to defend us is his addmission on page 289 that he never voted for the Reagan policies that helped the Berlin Wall come tumbling down. The tough guys who Jimmy allowed to humiliate us are, very obviously, still out there.  Charisma and writing talent does not necessarily a wise and strong leader make.
B000O178BY|5.0|It's easy for people to judge an artist that they've listened to for years.  Clearly we wouldn't continue to purchase their product if we didn't have an idea of what to expect.  On the other hand, a lot of consumers seem to WANT to purchase the same record over and over again.  One reason that Nine Inch Nails has continued to keep my interest is that as Trent Reznor has matured, his music has matured as well. (Nothing more pathetic than all of the 40+ \\"artists\\" that are still singing about getting laid, getting high, getting whatever they wanted when they were 20.)   <br /> <br />The Downward Spiral; I don't think I am alone in thinking it was easily the best album of 1994.  With so many fans jumping on the NIN bandwagon after the fact, it's difficult to keep an untarnished perspective of the relevance of the record.  It seems to me that when truely great records are released (Exile on Main Street, Nevermind, etc.) they speak more clearly to the people who were there at the time, and people who discover the music later, while they can appreciate it, there is a difference because as time passes, the mood of the people and the world changes. Jump ahead 13 years...  <br /> <br />\\"Zero Year\\" is the perfect album for 2007 because the fears of terrorism, our own government out of control, the general apathy that has overtaken the masses as we struggle to find anything to believe in - all of those feelings are reflected and magnified here.  This is Nine Inch Nails' greatest album yet. I'm sure that if the world lasts another 13 years, Mr. Renzor with have something relevant to say about it.
B000NA1OXY|4.0|Were all the other posts from former band losers in high school? I agree this album was a waste of more money than the typical person will ever get to spend, but let's look at the reality. Avril is POP!!! OK... Anti-pop for those who have your ear a little too close [...]... What was ever revolutionary about her? The easiest meal ticket in the world is being opposite of what is popular or trendy. How different is that? WOW... You wear white, so I will wear black. I don't know her, but guess what? When `Girlfriend' comes on the radio, I smile. That is what music is about, and that is enough for me. If you want to get deep, try ripping Mozart, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, or Django Reinhardt a new one. Not a 22 year old woman who has some spunk left in her. I encourage everyone to sample the tracks before they buy, and make your own decisions. I just had to rant about the stuffy pathetic losers that are probably fantasizing about her as if she sings about them. Get a life of your own, and learn to enjoy it.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I saw Rocky Balboa several times now, in the theater, and twice again on DVD.  I respect the film more every time I see it, and I thought I'd write something about it and send it along.  Rocky Balboa reminds me a lot of Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, one of my favorite films of all time.  It's about one man overcoming his own sense of nostalgia, the negativity all around him, the false authority of bureaucracy, and finally finding peace within himself.  The film depicts Rocky running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the snow, much as Kurosawa used the weather, and specifically a snow scene, to depict the moment when his main character finally gets in touch with himself in the present.  I wonder how much of an influence Ikiru was on the film?  Rocky Balboa is truly a masterpiece film, both for its screenplay and execution on film.  It will stand the test of time as a classic, along with Rocky I.
B000MGBSI0|5.0|It was a pleasure to see this series after all these years. I remember when we used to eagerly await Tuesday nights at 9:30pm for our dose of the Melrose gang.    Season 2 is one of the best of the entire series with classic storylines throughout.  It's also where Heather Locklear's character really took over and she is simply brilliant throughout.  It's not just her though that has made this the classic it is. You have Laura Leighton who shines as Sydney, Marcia Cross as Kimberley, and then there is the annoying but likeable Alison (played by Courtney Smith).    Look out for those famous scenes ie.   -where Kimberley removes her wig to reveal a nasty scar from the accident.  -Sydney hits rock bottom and becomes a prostitute  -Amanda throwing her weight around at work  -Billy and Alison's constant fights    The show actually holds up very well after all these years. Sure, it's far fetched at times and trashy, but there are also some true heartfelt moments which gave the show a human touch.     This is a risk free purchase. A must own!
B000MV9026|4.0|My kids and I love this movie.  The dancing penguins are the best and the environmental message of the movie is eye opening.  A Great family movie for all ages.
0767903862|5.0|This one started me reading all of Bryson's work but is still my all time favorite!
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I like.  While I still think that the UK band Mesh may have stolen Depeche Mode's crown while most of the world wasn't watching, this is a compelling release.
